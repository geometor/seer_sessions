Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair. Here's my breakdown of the example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid. Cells contain either '0' (white) or '4' (yellow).
*   **Output:** A 15x15 grid. It appears to be an expansion of the input grid, with some replication of the input pattern. The original 3x3 input grid appears to be repeated in the top-left corner, and then further alterations happen.
*.  **Colors:** Only two colors are involved: white (0) and yellow (4).

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 4]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 15x15
    elements: [0, 4]

properties:
  - object: input_grid
    property: cell_values
    values: [0, 4]
  - object: output_grid
    property: cell_values
    values: [0, 4]

actions:
    - name: replicate_with_modification
    description: The input pattern is replicated and modified to form the output pattern.

relationships:
  - type: expansion
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    details: The output grid is an expanded and modified version of the input grid, with a factor of 5 in terms of side but a factor of 4 is used to replicate input columns

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Replicate the input grid horizontally:** Take the input 3x3 grid and repeat its columns four times, adding to its side, to make the grid become 12x3.
2. **Add three empty columns:**. Add to the resulting image three columns to the end of it, to make the image become 15 x 3.
3.  **Replicate the input grid vertically:** The height is multiplied by five.
4. **Fill the remaining:** Fill the remaining cells, the bottom part from row 4, with 0.
