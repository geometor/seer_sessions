observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - shape: variable (MxN)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - shape: (3M x 3N), where M and N are dimensions of input_grid
  - action: tiling
    description: Input grid is replicated 3x3 times.
  - action: row_modification
    description: Certain rows of the tiled grid are set to 0, based on blue object location.
  - object: blue_pixel
    properties:
      - color: blue (represented by value 1)
    relationship: The y-coordinate (row index) of the blue pixel in the input grid determines which rows are zeroed out in the output grid.
