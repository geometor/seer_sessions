Previous Code:
```python
"""
The 3x3 input grid is replicated and tiled in the top-left corner of a 12x12 output grid.
The input is repeated four times in each of rows 1, 2, and 3.
Rows 4, 5, and 6 are the input, padded by 9 columns of white.
The remaining rows and columns are padded with white (0) cells.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a 12x12 array filled with 0 (white)
    output_grid = np.zeros((12, 12), dtype=int)

    # Tile Horizontally (first 3 rows)
    for row in range(3):
      for col_multiplier in range(4):
         output_grid[row, col_multiplier * 3 : (col_multiplier + 1) * 3] = input_grid

    # Tile and Pad (next 3 rows)
    for row in range(3,6):

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
