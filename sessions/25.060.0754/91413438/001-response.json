The input grids appear to be smaller and simpler than the output grids.  The transformation seems to involve replicating the input grid multiple times to form a larger grid. The replication pattern doesn't appear to be a simple tiling, as the width and height of the replication vary. The output grid seems to pad with many white pixels.\n\n**YAML Block of Facts:**\n\n"

This repetition forms the basis of the output rows. The number of columns in the expanded output grid will be the columns * the number of replication. In the provided examples, this replication number is not fixed and varies across examples.\n3.  **Replicate Vertically:** Repeat the horizontally expanded pattern vertically a variable number of times.\n4. **Padding**: Add 0 (white color) padding rows to the bottom and to the end columns if needed.\n\nThe crucial, unstated part is the *rule* governing the horizontal and vertical replication factors and the size and number of padding rows and columns. The examples given have different replication and padding for each example input/output pair.\n"
