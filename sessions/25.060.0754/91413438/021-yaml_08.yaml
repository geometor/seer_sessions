facts:
  - observation: The output grid is always 18x18, regardless of the input grid size.
  - observation: The input grid is replicated multiple times, both horizontally and vertically.
  - observation: The replication creates a rectangular block of the repeated input pattern in the top-left corner of the output grid.
  - observation: The remaining cells of the output grid, outside the replicated area, are filled with zeros (white color).
  - action: Replication - The input grid serves as a tile that is repeated.
  - constraint: The output dimensions are fixed at 18x18.
  - parameters:  Replication factors are determined from input shape and constant output size.
