The input grid contains cells with values of 0 (white) and 2 (red). The output grid appears to be a replication of the input grid, but expanded and padded with zeros. The core pattern of the input (red and white pixels) seems to be tiled across the top-left corner of the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
