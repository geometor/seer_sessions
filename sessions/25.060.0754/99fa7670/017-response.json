            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, leading to an oversimplified transformation rule. The core idea of horizontal expansion is partially correct, but the \"vertical expansion\" is not universally applicable. The code fails to correctly handle cases where the objects should not expand downwards, or where the expansion logic is different. My initial assumptions were not correct.\n\nMy strategy to address these issues is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine each input-output pair in the training set to identify common patterns and variations in the transformation rule.\n2.  **Refine object definition:** Determine if the current definition of \"object\" (any non-zero pixel) is sufficient or needs modification.\n3.  **Identify correct expansion logic:** Discard the initial vertical expansion rule. Focus on determining when and how objects expand, paying close attention to the boundaries and interactions between objects.\n4.  **Refactor natural language description**: describe the entire process for this task, start to finish.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nTo get precise details, I'll analyze the provided images of the input, expected output, and actual output grids.\n\n```tool_code\nprint(f\"\"\"\nExample 1:\nInput Shape: (3, 3)\nOutput Shape: (3, 3)\nCorrect: {np.array_equal(transform(train_input_1), train_output_1)}\n\nExample 2:\nInput Shape: (3, 5)\nOutput Shape: (3, 5)\nCorrect: {np.array_equal(transform(train_input_2), train_output_2)}\n\nExample 3:\nInput Shape: (5, 5)\nOutput Shape: (5, 5)\nCorrect: {np.array_equal(transform(train_input_3), train_output_3)}\n\"\"\")\n```"
