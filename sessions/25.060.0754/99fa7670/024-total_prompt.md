Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all non-zero pixels in the input grid.
2.  For each non-zero pixel:
    *   Locate the pixel's row.
    *    Starting with the pixel's original column, replace pixel values to right and on the same row, with the non-zero pixel's color, until reaching the right edge of the grid.
3. All other pixels (with original value 0) remain unchanged.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the described rule."""

    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows = len(input_grid)
    cols = len(input_grid[0])

    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Check if the pixel is non-zero
            if input_grid[i][j] != 0:
                # Expand the color to the right
                for k in range(j, cols):
                    output_grid[i][k] = input_grid[i][j]

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code correctly capture the core concept of expanding non-zero pixels to the right. However, the provided training set results reveal that the program, lacks a crucial detail: it doesn't consider that black(0) pixels act as "barriers", stopping color expansion, and black(0) should also expand, not only non-zero pixels. The strategy should involve, therefore, a correction of the initial assumption.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To confirm assumptions, and get better insight, let us look at the grids.

```tool_code
def grid_as_string(grid):
    return '\n'.join([' '.join(map(str, row)) for row in grid])

for example in task['train']:
    input_grid = example['input']
    expected_output_grid = example['output']
    predicted_output_grid = transform(input_grid)
    match = np.array_equal(predicted_output_grid,expected_output_grid)
    print(f"{'Input':-^45}")
    print(grid_as_string(input_grid))
    print(f"{'Expected Output':-^45}")
    print(grid_as_string(expected_output_grid))
    print(f"{'Predicted Output':-^45}")
    print(grid_as_string(predicted_output_grid))
    print(f"{'Match':-^45}")
    print(match)
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
