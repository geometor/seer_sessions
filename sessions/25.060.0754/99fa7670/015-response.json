The input grid contains two distinct objects: a single azure (8) pixel and a single gray (5) pixel. The output grid shows these objects expanded. The azure object expands horizontally to fill its row, and then extends downward to fill two rows. The gray object expands horizontally to fill part of its row, then extends downward by one row. It seems non-zero pixels are expanded to the right edge. The expansion continues down based on the original count of the non-zero pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
