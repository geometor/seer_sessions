Okay, let's analyze this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of pixels, all initially white (color code 0), into a grid where the outer frame is azure (color code 8) and the inner pixels remain white. The output grid's dimensions are the same or different as the input grid's dimensions. The key seems to be the creation of an "outer frame" or border of a specific color. It expands the size by one row above, one row below, and the required additional center rows depending on height.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
task: border_creation
input:
  type: grid
  elements: pixels
  initial_state:
    color: 0 (white)
output:
  type: grid
  elements: pixels
  final_state:
    border:
      color: 8 (azure)
      thickness: 1
    interior:
      color: 0 (white)
  dimensions: same height and width as input
objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - width
      - height
      - pixels
    actions:
      - change_color
relationships:
  - border pixels are adjacent to interior pixels
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input Grid:** Get the dimensions (height and width) of the input grid.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid with same dimensions as input
3.  **Set Border Pixels:** Change the color of all pixels in the outermost rows and columns of the output grid to azure (color code 8).
4. **Set Interior:** Keep color of all other pixels white (0).
5.  **Return:** The modified output grid.

Essentially, the transformation rule is to create an azure border around the original white grid, maintaining the inner white pixels. The border is always one pixel thick. The output dimensions will adjust based on the original input.
