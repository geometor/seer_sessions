objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D (rows x columns)
      - cells: integer values (0-9) representing colors
      - rows: independent units of transformation
  - type: colored_segment
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9, excluding 0 in most observed cases)
      - start_position: (row, column)
      - end_position: (row, column)
      - length: end_position.column - start_position.column + 1

actions:
  - name: replicate_segment
    description: Extends a colored segment within a row, possibly based on its existing pattern.
    parameters:
      - segment: colored_segment
      - row: specific grid row where the segment should be extended/replicated

relationships:
  - adjacency:  Crucial for defining segments (contiguous cells of the same color).
  - row_containment: Segments are contained within specific rows.
