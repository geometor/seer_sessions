The input grid contains pixels of values 0, 1, and 3 (white, blue, and green). The output grid contains pixels of values 0 and 2 (white and red). The output grid appears to be a simplified, smaller version of the input grid, focusing on specific features.  The dimensions of input and output are different. Input grid is 8x4, and output is 4x4.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Transform corresponding pixel in the output grid by assigning color red (2) in top left.\n3.  **Bottom Right**: Next, observe, in the bottom right, a 2x2 square of blue (1). Transform corresponding pixel in the output grid by assigning color red (2) in top left.\n4. **Consolidate and Place**: The output grid appears to be one quadrant of the input grid and represent it.\n5. **Fill**: Any area not matching the shape transformation is filled with white color (0)\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies certain color squares (based on color and position) in the input grid and maps the information as color red in the output grid, compacting to top left. Everything else become white.\n"
