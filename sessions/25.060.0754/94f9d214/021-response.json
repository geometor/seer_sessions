The first grid is larger (8x4) and contains a mix of digits 0, 1, and 3, which correspond to white, blue, and green colors, respectively. The second grid is smaller (4x4) and contains mostly 0s (white) with a single 2 (red) near the center. It appears the output grid is derived from the top-left 4x4 subgrid of the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
