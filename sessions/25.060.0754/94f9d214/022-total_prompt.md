Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input consists of two grids. The first grid is larger (8x4) and contains a mix of digits 0, 1, and 3, which correspond to white, blue, and green colors, respectively. The second grid is smaller (4x4) and contains mostly 0s (white) with a single 2 (red) near the center. It appears the output grid is derived from the top-left 4x4 subgrid of the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 8x4
    elements: [0, 1, 3]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: [0, 2]
  - name: top_left_subgrid
    type: subgrid
    parent: input_grid
    dimensions: 4x4

actions:
 - name: extract_subgrid
   agent: system
   input: input_grid
   parameters:
     row_start: 0
     col_start: 0
     row_end: 3
     col_end: 3
 - name: replace
   agent: system
   input: subgrid
   parameters:
    old_value: 3
    new_value: 2

relationships:
  - type: subgrid_of
    subject: top_left_subgrid
    object: input_grid
  - type: derives_from
    subject: output_grid
    object: top_left_subgrid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the 4x4 subgrid from the top-left corner of the input grid.
2. **Substitution:** Within this subgrid find occurances of element `3`, and replace with `2`.
3.  **Output:** The resulting 4x4 subgrid becomes the output grid.

In essence, it looks like the program takes a section of the input grid and changes the color of all of the green(3) pixels to red(2). Everything else remains unchanged and is converted to white(0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
