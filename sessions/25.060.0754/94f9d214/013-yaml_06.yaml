facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains pixels of various colors, represented by integers.
  - object_identification: |
      2x2 squares of identical colors within the input grid are significant objects.
  - action: |
      The transformation identifies 2x2 squares of the same color.
  - mapping: |
      Each 2x2 square in the input, regardless of its color, maps to a single pixel in the output.
  - color_rule: |
       If a 2x2 square has all the same color, the corresponding cell in the output grid should have the color red (2).
  - output_size: |
      The output grid is half the size of the input grid in both dimensions.
  - coordinate_mapping_observation: |
    The row and column index of the top-left cell of each 2x2 square in input grid is integer divided by 2 to get row, col of output grid
