objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of integers representing colors
    properties:
      - height: number of rows
      - width: number of columns
      - cells: individual elements with integer values (0-9)

  - type: color
    description:  represented by integers (0-9), corresponds to visual colors

actions:
  - transform:  input grid is transformed to output grid
  - expand: output grid has more rows and the number of rows is related to the maximum value on each column on input.
  - map_colors:  colors in the input grid map to colors in the output grid, but not directly (some change)

relationships:
  - input_to_output:  direct transformation, not 1:1 mapping
  - input_columns_to_output_rows_and_columns: there is a relationship between how many rows are created and the values on each of the columns
