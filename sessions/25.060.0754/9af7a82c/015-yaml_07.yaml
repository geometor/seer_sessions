    description: input grid to output grid
    rules:
      - column_mapping: |
          Input column 1 maps to Output column 1.
          Input column 2 maps to Output column 2.
          Input column 3 maps to Output column 3.
          Input column 4 maps to Output column.
      - value_change: Some input cell have changed.
      - expansion: output is larger size than the input
      - columns_to_zero: |
          The color from Input col 3 are in Output col 3, and cells to the right are filled with color 0.
          The colors from Input col 4 are in Output col 4, and cells to the right, and below, are filled with color 0.
          The colors from Input col 1 are in Output col 1, and cells to the right, and below, are filled with color 0, except where other rules take precedent.
          The colors from Input col 2 are in Output col 2, and cells below are filled with color 0, except where other rules take precedent.
