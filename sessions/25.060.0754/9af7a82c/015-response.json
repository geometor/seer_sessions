The input grid appears to be smaller (3x4) than the output grid (5x4).  There's a noticeable change in the arrangement and some values become 0.  Colors appear to be preserved in some locations but not others. The output seems to be an expansion of the input, and certain input colors map to output columns.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Fill the remaining lower cells in that column with 0.\n    *   Copy Column 2 colors to Output Column 2. Fill the remaining lower cells with color 0, except where other colors already present.\n    *   Copy Column 3 colors to Output Column 3. Fill cells to the right in these rows with color 0.\n    *   Copy Column 4 colors to Output Column 4. Fill cells to the right, and below, with color 0.\n\nIn essence, each column of the input grid is transferred to the corresponding column of the output grid. Then, based on which source column we are looking at:\n- column 3: horizontal fill with 0 to the right on the same row\n- column 4: horizontal fill with 0 to the right, and vertical down.\n- column 1 and 2: vertical fill with 0.\n"
