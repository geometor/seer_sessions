observations:
  - task: "Column Copy and Selective Fill"
  - input_grid_properties:
      - variable_dimensions: "Inputs have different heights and widths."
      - data_type: "integer grid"
      - color_values: "0-9, representing colors"
  - output_grid_properties:
      - dimensions: "Output grid size matches input grid size."
  - transformation_rules:
      - copy: "The input is copied to the output exactly."
      - fill: "No selective filling is performed. Only a direct copy occurs."
  - object_types:
    - static_grid: "The input grid is considered a static object."
    - copied_grid: "The output grid is a direct copy of the input."
  - object_interactions:
      - "No interactions between sub-objects within the grid are observed."
  - spatial_relations:
      - "The spatial arrangement of pixels is preserved during the copy operation."
