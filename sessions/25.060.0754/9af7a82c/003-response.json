The input grid contains single-digit integers, each corresponding to a color. The output grid also contains single-digit integers, and while some seem related to the input, others are 0, representing white. The spatial relationship between the input and output seems very important. It looks like columns are being mapped and potentially expanded.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

All output elements are set to the value of the first element in the input.\n3.  **Second Column:** The input's second column maps to output's second column. The output's first three elements are set to the value of the first element of the input column. The rest of the output column is set to 0.\n4. **Third Column:** The Input's third column maps to the output's third column. The output's first element gets the value of the first input element. All other output elements in the column are set to 0.\n\nIn essence, the program extracts the first element of each input column and uses it to selectively populate the output grid's corresponding column, with specific rules about expansion and filling with zeros.\n"
