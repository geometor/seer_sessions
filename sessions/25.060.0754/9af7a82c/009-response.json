The colors in the input grid seem to be mapped to specific positions in the output grid, and a filling pattern is applied, expanding downwards. The color white (0) appears to be a background or filler color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Specifically, input column `i` maps to output column `3 - i`.\n3. **Vertical Expansion:**\n      - The color in the last row of input will occupy the entire column in the output.\n      - All colors except in last row is copied to the same column, down to row index equal to the initial row + 1 in the input.\n4. **Fill with Zero:** All remaining cells in the output grid are filled with the color 0 (white).\n\nEssentially, the program takes each color from the input grid, places it in the reversed column order on the first row of the output, then expands specific color downwards before filling the rest with 0.\n"
