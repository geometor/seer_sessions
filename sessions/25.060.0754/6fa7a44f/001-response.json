The input grids are always 3x3, and the output grids are 3x6, suggesting a replication or mirroring operation. The core operation appears to be some form of duplication of the input grid. The arrangement of colors/numbers in the input grid seems preserved in the output, with some repetition. It looks like the input grid is copied and placed below, then rotated.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
