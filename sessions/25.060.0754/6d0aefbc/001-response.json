The transformation appears to involve *expanding* the original grid, specifically doubling its width.  The expansion isn't a simple replication, but seems to involve a mirroring or reflection of elements, with the center line serving as the point of reflection. The shape changes, but the objects are preserved, duplicated on opposite sides of an invisible axis that runs down the middle.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
