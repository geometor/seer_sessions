objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (input), 3x6 (output)
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
      - structure: 2D array

actions:
  - type: expansion
    description: The width of the grid is doubled.
  - type: reflection (or mirroring)
    description:  Elements appear to be reflected across a vertical axis in the center of the expanded grid.

relationships:
  - input grid is transformed into output grid
  - output grid width = 2 * input grid width
  - output grid height = input grid height
  - Elements on the left side of input are mirrored to right side of output with input columns[n] = output column[n] and input column [n] = output column[width -1 - n]
