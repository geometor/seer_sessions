The grids contain single-digit integers representing different colors.  The output grid seems to be a condensed or extracted version of the input grid, retaining only specific colored pixels and seemingly reducing the overall size and complexity. There are a few key colors that appear to be important (red, blue, yellow), while others (white/0) are mostly discarded. The spatial relationships (adjacency, relative position) between the colored pixels seem crucial.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It then reconstructs a smaller grid based on these extracted elements. The program focuses on specific color clusters and their spatial relationship within the structure.\n"
