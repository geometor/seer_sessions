The transformation seems to involve a significant reduction in grid size and a rearrangement of the colored objects within the grid.  There appear to be vertical \"stems\" or \"lines\" of different colors that are being compressed or summarized in the output. The corners seem important, particularly the color yellow (4).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These will define the corners of the smaller, *output* grid. If corner pixels of value 4 do not exist, ignore this rule.\n\n2. **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid's dimensions are defined by drawing horizontal and vertical lines between opposite yellow corner pixels. If there are no yellow corners, the output size is the minimum rectangle enclosing all non-zero pixels.\n\n3. **Summarize Vertical Stems:** For each non-zero, non-corner column in the input, identify contiguous vertical \"stems\" of the same color.  A \"stem\" is a vertical sequence of one or more pixels of the same color.\n\n4. **Place Stems in Output:**  Represent each identified stem within the output grid's corresponding column.\n    - The stem is represented by the same color.\n    - Replicate that color in the *output* grid, filling a rectangle in the output column. The rectangle fills the whole column, except the top and bottom row if yellow pixels were present.\n\n5. **Preserve corner elements**: replicate the yellow pixels in the corners to the output grid.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts a compressed representation of the vertical color stems, framed by the corner pixels. If corner pixels are missing, create the smallest bounding box for the stem elements.\n"
