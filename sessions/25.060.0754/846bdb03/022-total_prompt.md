Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid appears to contain isolated single-color regions (shapes) of colors yellow(4), orange(7), and green(3), and the background is white(0). The output grid seems to be a condensed and simplified representation of the input, retaining only some of the colored pixels and rearranging them. The spatial relationships between the colored regions in the input are somewhat preserved but significantly altered in the output. There appears to be an emphasis on the vertical and horizontal extent of the original shapes.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 13x13
      - background_color: 0 (white)
      - contains: [yellow_regions, orange_regions, green_regions]

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x6
      - background_color: 0 (white)

  - object: yellow_regions
    type: region
    color: 4 (yellow)
    properties:
      - shape_input: [isolated, elongated_vertical]
      - shape_output:  [corners, single_pixel]
      - location: [top, bottom, edges]

  - object: orange_regions
    type: region

      - shape_output:  [connected,vertical_line]
      - location: [ left_side,  some_overlap_with_green ]

  - object: green_regions
    type: region
    color: 3 (green)
    properties:
       - shape_input: [isolated, elongated_vertical]
       - shape_output: [connected, vertical_line]
       - location: [ right_side, some_overlap_with_orange ]

  - action: condensation
    description: The input grid is reduced in size to create the output grid.

  - relationship: spatial_correspondence
    description:  Colored regions in the input generally map to corresponding colored regions in the output, with changes in shape and position.

  - action: shape_simplification
    description:  Elongated regions are reduced and may merge
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of non-white pixels (colors 4, 7, and 3) in the input grid.

2.  **Condense and Extract:**
    *   Yellow (4): Extract the corners. Keep only the first and last row of the yellow regions and remove interior rows. Keep first and last columns.
    *   Orange (7) and Green (3): Merge vertically adjacent or overlapping regions of the orange and green. Create a rectangle for each color.
    * construct vertical orange and green regions by combining all vertically adjacent pixels of the same color
    * merge them together when neighbors
    * place the merge area into the condensed output

3. condense the image by removing all rows that are only white pixels

4. Condense the final image horizontally to the width of the widest colored region.

5.  **Assemble Output:** Place the extracted and simplified shapes into a new, smaller grid. The overall background of the output grid should be white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
