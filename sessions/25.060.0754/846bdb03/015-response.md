Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains multiple colored pixels (represented by non-zero integers), surrounded by a large background of white pixels (represented by 0). The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, retaining some, but not all, of the colored pixels from the input, and arranged differently. There are no obvious geometric transformations like rotations or reflections. The colors present in the output appear to be directly taken from the input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [13x13] # Input grid dimensions
      elements:  # Listing all elements and their colors is cumbersome; referring to color groups is better.
          - color: white (0) #background
          - color: yellow (4)
          - color: red (2)
          - color: blue (1)
    actions:
      - condensed
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [4x6]   # Output grid dimensions
      elements:
          - color: white (0)
          - color: yellow (4)
          - color: red (2)
          - color: blue (1)
relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid # Not precisely "contains", but some elements are preserved.
  - type: color_preservation #colors from the input are in the output
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Clusters:** Locate distinct clusters of non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid.  A cluster is defined as a group of contiguous (adjacent horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) non-white pixels.
2. **Bounding Box:** For each identified cluster, determine the smallest rectangular bounding box that completely encloses all pixels of that cluster.
3. **Sample from Bounding Boxes:** Extract pixels by selecting information from the columns where non-white pixels first appear, and the rows where those pixels are in the input grid.
4. **Assemble Output:** Arrange these extracted pixels/rows in a condensed rectangular grid, and remove all complete rows and columns with white pixels. The output grid will contain only the information from that sampling.

In more concise terms: Find the colored regions, imagine boxes around them, and then create a smaller grid by extracting the essential parts of those boxes.
