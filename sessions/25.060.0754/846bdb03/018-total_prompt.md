Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Clusters:** Locate distinct clusters of non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid.  A cluster is defined as a group of contiguous (adjacent horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) non-white pixels.
2. **Bounding Box:** For each identified cluster, determine the smallest rectangular bounding box that completely encloses all pixels of that cluster.
3. **Sample from Bounding Boxes:** Extract pixels by selecting information from the columns where non-white pixels first appear, and the rows where those pixels are in the input grid.
4. **Assemble Output:** Arrange these extracted pixels/rows in a condensed rectangular grid, and remove all complete rows and columns with white pixels. The output grid will contain only the information from that sampling.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, focusing on identifying clusters, finding bounding boxes, and extracting relevant rows and columns. However, the provided examples show that the approach needs refinement. The current strategy extracts *all* rows and columns where cluster pixels are found. This is too broad. The core issue appears to be that it's selecting too much information. We need to narrow down the extraction to something more specific. Instead of taking *all* rows/cols touched by the cluster, maybe we only need some specific row/col related to cluster position.

The idea is to use the `extract_rows_cols` function to properly sample the correct information from the input grid.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Here's a breakdown of each example, the expected output, the actual output from the code, and observations:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    [[7, 7, 7],
     [7, 7, 7]]
    ```
*   **Actual Output:**
    ```
    [[7, 7, 7],
     [7, 7, 7]]
    ```
*   **Observation:**  The code works correctly for this case.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
     [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    [[5],
     [5],
     [5]]
    ```
*   **Actual Output:**
    ```
    [[5],
     [5],
     [5]]
    ```
*   **Observation:** The code works correctly for this case.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
      [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    [[6, 6, 6],
     [6, 6, 6],
     [6, 6, 6]]
    ```
*   **Actual Output:**
    ```
    [[6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Observation:** The code failed here. It includes extra columns. It should only contain the shape described by the color 6.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: cluster
    description: A contiguous group of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the cluster.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing the cluster.
  - action: extract
    description: Select a subset of the input grid based on identified clusters.
    parameters:
      - rows: The rows to be included in the output.
      - columns: The columns to be included in the output.
  - action: sample_grid
    description: extract grid by selecting rows and columns of the original grid
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Clusters:** Find all distinct clusters of non-white pixels in the input grid. A cluster is a group of adjacent (horizontally or vertically) pixels of the same non-white color.

2.  **Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangular bounding box that completely encloses *each* cluster.

3. **Sample from first cluster:** Use the row and column of where the cluster begins to sample the grid.

4.  **Assemble Output:** Create a new grid using only information sampled from the original grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
