There are objects of color 3 (green), 8 (azure), and 4 (yellow). The background is 0 (white). The output grid seems to be a cropped and rearranged version of the input, retaining only some of the colored objects and changing their relative positions. It appears that the objects are treated as individual units that can be moved and cropped. The colors of the objects are preserved during transformation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Specifically, focus on objects with colors 3 (green), 8 (azure), and 4 (yellow).\n\n2.  **Select boundary**: Find two yellow(4) pixels.\n\n3.  **Crop:** Crop the input grid to form output grid. Horizontal boundaries are from first row to the row where the yellow objects are. Vertical boundaries are from the leftmost position of the yellow object to the rightmost position of the object +7 columns to the right.\n\n4. **Reposition:**\n    *   Place the yellow(4) pixels on the top left and bottom left corner in output.\n    *   Place the green object to the right edge of the output.\n    *   Place the azure object to the left edge of the output.\n\n5.  **Resize**: Adjust objects to fit them into new configuration\n\n6.  **Fill**: Fill remaining areas with white(0) background color.\n\n7. Preserve colours of objects\n\n"
