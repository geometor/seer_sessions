```python
"""
1. **Identify Clusters:** Find all distinct clusters of non-white pixels in the input grid. A cluster is a group of adjacent (horizontally or vertically) pixels of the same non-white color.
2. **Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangular bounding box that completely encloses *each* cluster.
3. **Sample from first cluster:** Use the row and column of where the cluster begins to sample the grid.
4. **Assemble Output:** Create a new grid using only information sampled from the original grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial strategy focused on identifying clusters, finding their bounding boxes, and then extracting a subgrid based on the *first* cluster's bounding box. This approach works for the first example but fails for others because:

1.  **Multiple Clusters:** Some examples have multiple clusters of different colors, and the transformation involves more than just the first cluster.  The current code only considers the bounding box of the first identified cluster.
2.  **Not Just Bounding Boxes:** Some examples may require combining elements, or using parts of the grid *outside* any given single object's bounding box. The core idea of the transformation is not merely an extraction of the first bounding box.
3. **Object properties**: Some objects have properties of shape or position and may require spatial reasoning or knowledge of geometry.

To address these issues, the revised strategy should:

1.  **Consider All Clusters:** The logic should process all clusters, not just the first.
2.  **Identify Relationships:**  Instead of just taking the first bounding box, the code should discern relationships *between* the clusters (or parts of those clusters) and how they relate to construct the output. It looks like the upper-left corner of the bounding box is defining the sampling.
3. **Generalized Rule:** Consider if a generalized rule, beyond cluster extraction, is driving output construction.

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand the specific failures, let's execute the code on each training example and compare the output with the expected output. I will collect the following metrics where helpful:

*   **Number of Clusters:** In both input and expected output.
*   **Bounding Box Dimensions:** Of each cluster.
*   **Output Dimensions:** Of generated and expected outputs.
*   **Pixel-wise Comparison:** A boolean grid indicating where the generated output differs from the expected output.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a contiguous block of non-white pixels.
2.  **Copy Objects:**  Create copies of each object in the input.
3.  **Assemble Output:**  Create an output grid by arranging the copied objects. The objects are arranged by their appearance from left to right and top to bottom. The top-left corner of each object's bounding box in the input determines its position, row by row, in the output.

In essence, the transformation *copies* all the objects in the input grid, and arranges the objects in the output grid. The relative size and shapes of the objects remain the same, and their order, from left to right and top to bottom (based on the top-left coordinate of their bounding boxes), is preserved. The size and contents of the output are solely determined by the copied objects.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
