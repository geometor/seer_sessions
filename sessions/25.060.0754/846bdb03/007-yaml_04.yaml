      position: (4,5) to (6,7)
    - color: yellow (4)
      shape: single pixel
      position: (1,6)
    - color: yellow (4)
      shape: single pixel
      position: (6,0)

  output_objects:
    - color: blue (1)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,0) to (3,0)
    - color: red (2)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (0,2) to (2,3)
      notes: maintains relative position to blue
    - color: yellow (4)
      shape: single pixel
      position: (4,0)
    - color: black(0) #added
      shape: single pixel
      position: (1, 1)

  actions:
    - extract connected blue component
    - extract connected red component adjacent to blue
    - reposition components to top-left, maintaining relative positions
    - copy yellow pixel from bottom left input corner
    - place a black pixel

      position: (4,0) to (6,2)
    - color: yellow (4)
      shape: single pixel
      position: (1,1)
    - color: yellow (4)
      shape: single pixel
      position: (6,5)

  output_objects:
    - color: blue (1)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,4) to (2,4)
    - color: red (2)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (0,0) to (2,2)
    - color: yellow (4)
      shape: single pixel
      position: (3,4)
      notes: bottom right of original

  actions:
    - extract connected blue component
    - extract connected red component adjacent to blue
    - reposition components to top-left, maintaining relative positions
    - copy yellow pixel if at corner (bottom right in this case)

       position: (1,2)
     - color: yellow (4)
       shape: single pixel
       position: (6,7)

  output_objects:
     - color: blue (1)
       shape: vertical line
       position: (0,4) to (2,4)
     - color: red (2)
