objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 13x13
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 6x8
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - name: red_pixels
    type: object cluster
    properties:
       - color: red (2)
       - shape: appears to form a contiguous "blob" or vertical structure in input.
       
  - name: blue_pixels
    type: object cluster
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape: Forms a mostly horizontal or L like contiguous structure in input.

  - name: yellow_pixels
    type: object cluster
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - shape: appears as corner single pixels and at bottom of the red vertical structure.

actions:
  - name: extraction
    description: Selected pixels from the input grid are copied to the output grid.
  - name: size_reduction
    description: The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid.
  - name: spatial_rearrangement
    description: the relative position between the clusters might change.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains red_pixels, blue_pixels, and yellow_pixels.
  - output_grid contains a subset of red_pixels, blue_pixels, and yellow_pixels from input.
  - red shape "interacts" with blue pixels on their right and yellow pixels
