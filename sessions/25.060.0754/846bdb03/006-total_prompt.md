The transformation extracts the connected red, the adjacent blue, and the specific yellow pixels from the input grid, maintaining their relative positions (though scaled down), and discards everything else. It then reconstructs a smaller grid based on these extracted elements. The program focuses on specific color clusters and their spatial relationship within the structure.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code captured the core idea of extracting connected red and blue components, and relating them to the presence of yellow pixels at corners. However, the results across multiple examples show inconsistencies. Specifically:

1.  **Output Size:** The initial code hardcoded the output grid size. This needs to be dynamic, determined by the dimensions of the extracted components.
2.  **Yellow Pixel Logic:** The corner-based logic for yellow pixels is not universally applicable, sometimes only a subset of yellow needs to be include and sometimes yellow is placed with complex rules other than corners
3.  **Blue Placement:** while generally adjacent to red and aligned, there are subtle shifts relative to the red that the original program failed to account for.

The strategy to address these issues will involve:

1.  **Dynamic Output Size:** Calculate output grid dimensions based on the bounding box encompassing the extracted red and blue components.
2.  **Refined Yellow Logic:** Develop a more flexible rule for including yellow pixels, potentially based on adjacency to the red/blue structure or a count/pattern, not just corners.
3.  **Precise Relative Positioning:**. Determine a more consistent method using relative positioning.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

To gather metrics and accurately analyze the examples, I'll use the provided `code_execution` capability in subsequent turns to programmatically analyze each input/output/predicted output. Here's a preliminary breakdown, which I will confirm and expand with code execution:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: (21 x 21)
    *   Output: (6 x 8)
    *   Prediction: (6 x 8) - Correct size, but content mismatches.
    *   Notes: The prediction mostly matches, except for some of the yellow placement
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: (20 x 20)
    *   Output: (4 x 7)
    *   Prediction: (6 x 8) - Incorrect size.
    *  Notes: No yellow in input, output only contains red and blue.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: (21 x 21)
    *   Output: (6 x 7)
    *   Prediction: (6 x 8) - Incorrect size.
    *   Notes: Similar to example 1.

**YAML Facts**

  - name: red_component
    color: red
    type: connected_component

    color: blue
    type: connected_component
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - adjacent_to: red_component
  - name: yellow_pixels
    color: yellow
    type: pixels
    properties:
      - variable_placement # Indicates that placement rules are complex
      - related_to: [red_component, blue_component]

actions:
  - name: extract
    description: Extract connected components based on color.
  - name: position_relative
    description: Position components relative to each other.
  - name: determine_size
    description: determine size of output based on the size and shape of the
      red and blue component
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Components:** Find all connected red pixels, forming the `red_component`. Find all blue pixels and from those adjacent to the `red_component` create the `blue_component`. Locate all yellow pixels.

2.  **Extract Red and Blue:** Extract the `red_component` and the `blue_component`.

3.  **Determine Output Size:** Calculate the bounding box that encompasses both the extracted `red_component` and `blue_component`. The dimensions of this bounding box will be the size of the output grid.

4.  **Place Red and Blue:** Copy the `red_component` and `blue_component` into the output grid, maintaining their relative positions. Use the top-left corner of the bounding box as the origin (0,0) for placement.

5. **Determine Yellow Pixel Placement:**
   - If there are yellow pixels in corners of the input, place yellow in those same corners in the output, relative to the red/blue components
   - If there are yellow pixels below the red component, place at the bottom of the output

6.  **Create Output:** Construct the final output grid based on the above steps. All other cells are black (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
