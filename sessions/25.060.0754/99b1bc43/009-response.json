The input grid contains various colors represented by digits (0-9), while the output grid seems to have a reduced size and a more limited set of colors (primarily 0 and 3, which correspond to white and green). The input grid appears to be divided into distinct sections or blocks of colors. The output seems to select some representation of these.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Otherwise the output is `0`.\n\n```"

The output grid's dimensions will be derived from the number of 2x2 blocks in each dimension of the input grid.\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies the presence of the number `1` (blue) in each 2x2 area, and if exists, the program changes it to 3 (green). If 1 doesn't not exists, it puts 0 in the output grid cell.\n"
