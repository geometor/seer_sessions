            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a single training example, and it correctly captured the 2x2 block processing. However, it's clear from the additional training examples that the initial rule, \"if blue is present, output green; otherwise, output white,\" is too simplistic and doesn't cover all cases. Specifically the 2x2 square is not always a block, and appears to sometimes trace the outline of the 2x2 square. The core concept of a 2x2 kernel operation is valid, but the conditional logic within each 2x2 block needs adjustment.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples:** Examine the relationship between the input and output grids in *all* provided training examples, not just the first.\n2.  **Refine the Condition:** Identify the *precise* condition within each 2x2 input block that determines the output color. It's not just the presence of blue, but the *number* of blue, or the presence of other colors in a specific pattern/arrangement, or a combination of these.\n3. **Adaptive Logic:** The rule needs to be more refined and use more general logic.\n4. **YAML & NLP Update:** Update the YAML description and natural language program to reflect the revised understanding.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo get accurate metrics, I need to use the `code_execution` tool. Below is a sample of the type of data that will be extracted, before using `code_execution`\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 6x10, Output: 3x5\n    *   Initial Code Result: Correct.\n    *   Observation: 2x2 input blocks with any blue become green.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 6x6, Output: 3x3\n    *   Initial Code Result: **Incorrect.**\n    *   Observation: 2x2 input tracing pattern.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 10x10, Output: 5x5\n    *    Initial Code Result: **Incorrect.**\n    *   Observation: 2x2 input tracing a pattern.\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task: \"ARC Task\"\n  - objective: \"Determine the transformation rule from input to output grids.\"\n  - input_grid_size: \"Variable, between 1x1 and 30x30\"\n  - output_grid_size: \"Variable, related to input size, approximately half in each dimension\"\n  - colors: \"Integers 0-9, representing colors (white, blue, red, green, etc.)\"\n  - initial_observation: \"Input grid is processed in 2x2 non-overlapping blocks.\"\n  - example_1_observation: \"If a 2x2 block contains color '1' (blue), the output cell is '3' (green); otherwise, '0' (white).\"\n  - example_2_observation: \"If a 2x2 block contains colors in top left, bottom right, and top right, the output is the color in the bottom left.\"\n  - example_3_observation: \"If a 2x2 block contains colors in top left, bottom right, and top right, the output is the color in the bottom left.\"\n  - refined_observation: \"The transformation rule is dependent on a 2x2 kernel operation, where each output pixel reflects some property of the corresponding 2x2 section of input pixels.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Revised):**\n\n1.  **Divide:** Conceptually divide the input grid into non-overlapping 2x2 blocks.\n2.  **Inspect:** For each 2x2 block in the input:\n    1.  Check the pattern.\n    2.  If the pattern is blue on the top left, bottom right, and top right, output the color in the bottom left of the square.\n    3. If blue is only in a single cell, output is green\n    4. Else, Output White.\n3.  **Output:** Create an output grid with dimensions half the size of the input grid (rounding down if necessary). Each cell in the output grid corresponds to a 2x2 block in the input.\n\n"
