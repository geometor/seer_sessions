facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation rule considers 2x2 non-overlapping blocks within a 4x4 region of the input grid.
  - input_regions:
      - region1: Top-left 2x2 block.
      - region2: Top-right 2x2 block.
      - region3: Bottom-left 2x2 block.
      - region4: Bottom-right 2x2 block.
  - actions_on_homogenous_blocks:
      - condition: "If all pixels in a 2x2 block are 0 (white):"
        action: "Output block is 0 (white)."
      - condition: "If all pixels in a 2x2 block are 1 (blue):"
        action: "Output block is 3 (green)."
      - condition: "If all pixels in a 2x2 block are 2 (red):"
        action: "Output block is 3 (green)."
      - condition: "If all pixels in a 2x2 block are 4 (yellow):"
        action: "Output block is 0 (white)."
  - actions_on_mixed_blocks:
      - condition: "If pixels in a 2x2 block have mixed colors:"
        action: "Output block is first color of the 2x2 block in the input grid."
  - grid_size_check: input grid must be greater than or equal to 4x4
