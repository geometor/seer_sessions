    input_size: 20x19
    output_size: 4x4
    colors_in_input: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    colors_in_output: [0, 3]
    relevant_colors: [1, 2, 4]
    output_color: 3
    relevant_region_input:  "Positions of Blue(1), Red(2), Yellow(4) define the positions in a 4x4 grid, changed to green(3)."
    notes: "All Blue(1), Red(2), and Yellow(4) pixels are within the top-left 4x4 and correctly mapped."
  - example_2:
    input_size: 20x13
    output_size: 4x4
    colors_in_input: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
    colors_in_output: [0, 3]
    relevant_colors: [1, 2, 4]
    output_color: 3
    relevant_region_input:  "Positions of Blue(1), Red(2), Yellow(4) define the positions in a 4x4 grid, changed to green(3)."
    notes: "Blue(1), Red(2), and Yellow(4) pixels are NOT all within the top-left 4x4. Only the colors at (2,0) (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0) (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) should map to the output."
  - example_3:
    input_size: 13x18
    output_size: 4x4
    colors_in_input: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    colors_in_output: [0, 3]
    relevant_colors: [1, 2, 4]
    output_color: 3
    relevant_region_input:  "Positions of Blue(1), Red(2), Yellow(4) define the positions in a 4x4 grid, changed to green(3)."
    notes: "All Blue(1), Red(2), and Yellow(4) are outside of the 4x4 region.  The output is the 4x4 grid from row 5 to row 8 inclusive, and the first four columns"
