Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation takes each 2x2 block of the top-left 4x4 region of the input, checks the color of its constituent cells. If cell contains only 0, it is set to 0. If it contains only 1, the cell is changed to 3. If it contains only 2, it is changed to 3. If it contains only 4, it is changed to zero.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code focused on 2x2 blocks within a 4x4 region of the input grid and applied specific color transformations based on the homogeneity of the 2x2 block. It correctly handled some cases but failed on others, particularly when the 2x2 blocks were not homogenous or when other colors were present. The code also restricts its operation to a 4x4 area, which may not be generally applicable. The strategy should be to generalize conditions to account for the heterogeneous blocks and to determine what part of input grid should be considered.

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution):**

I'll use the provided examples.

```python
import numpy as np

def check_examples(transform, examples):
    results = []
    for i, example in enumerate(examples):
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        expected_output = np.array(example['output'])
        transformed_grid = transform(input_grid)
        is_correct = np.array_equal(transformed_grid, expected_output)

        results.append({
            'example_index': i,
            'input_shape': input_grid.shape,
            'output_shape': expected_output.shape,
            'is_correct': is_correct,
            'transformed_grid': transformed_grid.tolist(),  # Convert to list for easy viewing
            'expected_output': expected_output.tolist()
        })
    return results
examples = [
    {'input': [[0, 0, 2, 2, 5, 5], [0, 0, 2, 2, 5, 5], [2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6], [2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 7], [4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 7]],

   print(f"  Input shape: {result['input_shape']}")
   print(f"  Output shape: {result['output_shape']}")
   print(f"  Correct: {result['is_correct']}")

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Region of Interest:** Consider the top-left 4x4 subgrid of the input grid.

2.  **Divide into Blocks:** Divide this 4x4 region into four 2x2 non-overlapping blocks.

3.  **Apply Transformation Rules:** For each 2x2 block:

    *   If all pixels within the block are 0 (white), the output block remains 0 (white).
    *   If all pixels within the block are 1 (blue), the output block becomes 3 (green).
    *   If all pixels within the block are 2 (red), the output block becomes 3 (green).
    *   If all pixels within the block are 4 (yellow), the output block becomes 0 (white).
    *   If the pixels within the block are not uniform (mixed colors), the output
        block is the value of the first cell of the sub-grid.

4. The result is a 4x4 output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
