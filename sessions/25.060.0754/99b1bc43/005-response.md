Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved consolidating 2x2 blocks into either green (if yellow was present) or white. The additional training examples reveal that this rule is too simplistic and doesn't fully capture the transformation logic. The core issue is that the initial program consolidates _all_ blocks, rather than just yellow ones, or blocks *containing* yellow.

My strategy will be to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, paying close attention to how the presence, absence, and position of yellow pixels influence the output.
2.  **Identify Correct and Incorrect Predictions:** Compare the code's output with the expected output for each example to pinpoint exactly where the logic fails. I'll record the grid dimensions, presence of yellow, etc. using code execution.
3.  **Refine the Rule:** Based on the error analysis, I will revise the natural language program to accurately describe the conditions under which consolidation occurs and the resulting color.
4.  **Consider Edge Cases:** Think about what happens at the edges of the grid if the dimensions are not even multiples of the block size (2x2).

**Metrics and Example Analysis (using code execution)**
```tool_code
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(examples, transform_function):
    results = []
    for i, example in enumerate(examples):
        input_grid = example['input']
        expected_output = example['output']
        predicted_output = transform_function(input_grid)
        correct = np.array_equal(np.array(predicted_output), np.array(expected_output))
        input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid)
        yellow_present = 4 in input_grid_np
        input_height, input_width = input_grid_np.shape
        output_height, output_width = np.array(expected_output).shape
        results.append({
            'example_index': i,
            'input_dims': (input_height, input_width),
            'output_dims':(output_height, output_width),
            'yellow_present': yellow_present,
            'correct': correct
        })
    return results

# You'll need to define `train` and `transform` with your example data and the transformation function.
# I've created dummy data here. Replace with your actual data.
train = [
  {'input': [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]], 'output': [[3]]},
  {'input': [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4], [0, 0, 4, 4]], 'output': [[0, 3], [3, 3]]},
    {'input': [[1, 1, 1, 4], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]], 'output': [[1,3],[1,1]]},
    {'input': [[1,4],[1,1]], 'output': [[3]]},
    {'input': [[4]], 'output': [[3]]}

print(json.dumps(analyze_results(train, transform), indent=2))
