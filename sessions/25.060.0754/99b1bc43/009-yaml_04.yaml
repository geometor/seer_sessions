objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: 9x4
        elements: [0, 1, 2, 4] # Colors present in the input
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: 4x4
        elements: [0, 3] # Colors present in the output

actions:
  - name: reduce_grid
    description: The input grid is reduced in size to create the output grid.
  - name: select_color
    description: A representative color is chosen from sections of the input grid and placed in the output grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid_sections: The input grid can be conceptually divided into 2x2 blocks of cells.
  - output_grid_cells: Each cell in the output grid corresponds to a 2x2 block in the input.
  - color_representation:  If a 2x2 section of the Input Grid contains color `1` the corresponding location in the output is color `3`. Otherwise the output is `0`.
