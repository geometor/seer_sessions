facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x4
    elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    properties:
      - contains regions of solid color
      - regions vary in size and shape, often rectangular.
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    properties:
      - color of each cell seems derived from input_grid.
  - observation: input_grid can be partitioned into subgrids.
  - observation: colors in subgrids are homogeneous (all pixels are the same color)
  - action: transformation
    type: mapping
    description: input_grid regions map to output_grid cells
  - relation:
     subject: input_grid
     predicate: maps_to
     object: output_grid
     rule: "A specific function or rule determines the output cell color."
