            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the initial `transform` function to the training examples and refine our understanding of the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code focused on analyzing 2x2 blocks within a 4x4 region of the input and applying a color-mapping rule based on the homogeneity of these blocks. The results show that this approach is partially correct, but needs adjustments. The initial code will work fine for the examples that fit the described condition. However, errors indicate that the logic isn't universally applicable across all training examples. There might be other regions in the input grid or other conditions to consider.\n\nThe main strategy for improvement will involve a more detailed examination of *all* input-output pairs, not just the top-left corner. And, check the size of the input. If it is less than 4x4, don't execute the function. We'll look for consistent patterns in how colors change, positions shift, or objects interact across the *entire* grid.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere is a report of training set results - since we do not have access to\n`code_execution`, we can make only general observations.\n\n*   **Example 1**:\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Expected Output vs. Actual Output: Match.\n    *   Notes: All input subgrids are homogeneous, or all colors are identical.\n\n*   **Example 2**:\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Expected Output vs. Actual Output: No Match.\n    *   Notes: Some of the 2x2 input subgrids have mixed pixel colors.\n\n*   **Example 3**:\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Expected Output vs. Actual Output: No Match.\n    *   Notes: Some of the 2x2 input subgrids have mixed pixel colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      The transformation rule considers 2x2 non-overlapping blocks within a 4x4 region of the input grid.\n  - input_regions:\n      - region1: Top-left 2x2 block.\n      - region2: Top-right 2x2 block.\n      - region3: Bottom-left 2x2 block.\n      - region4: Bottom-right 2x2 block.\n  - actions_on_homogenous_blocks:\n      - condition: \"If all pixels in a 2x2 block are 0 (white):\"\n        action: \"Output block is 0 (white).\"\n      - condition: \"If all pixels in a 2x2 block are 1 (blue):\"\n        action: \"Output block is 3 (green).\"\n      - condition: \"If all pixels in a 2x2 block are 2 (red):\"\n        action: \"Output block is 3 (green).\"\n      - condition: \"If all pixels in a 2x2 block are 4 (yellow):\"\n        action: \"Output block is 0 (white).\"\n  - actions_on_mixed_blocks:\n      - condition: \"If pixels in a 2x2 block have mixed colors:\"\n        action: \"Output block is first color of the 2x2 block in the input grid.\"\n  - grid_size_check: input grid must be greater than or equal to 4x4\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Input Check**: Verify the input grid's dimensions. If either dimension is less than 4, return an appropriately sized grid filled with 0s, as per the task's implicit requirements.\n\n2. **Region Selection**: Consider the top-left 4x4 region of the input grid.\n\n3.  **Block Division**: Divide this 4x4 region into four 2x2 non-overlapping blocks.\n\n4.  **Homogeneity Check**: For each 2x2 block:\n\n    *   If all pixels are 0 (white), the corresponding 2x2 block in the output is 0 (white).\n    *   If all pixels are 1 (blue), the corresponding 2x2 block in the output is 3 (green).\n    *   If all pixels are 2 (red), the corresponding 2x2 block in the output is 3 (green).\n    *   If all pixels are 4 (yellow), the corresponding 2x2 block in the output is 0 (white).\n    *  If Mixed, the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid will have all elements equal to the first element of the subgrid\n\n5.  **Output**: Return the 4x4 output grid.\n"
