Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved consolidating 2x2 blocks containing yellow pixels into single green pixels. The provided results show the transform works perfectly for first two training pairs, but not on the last pair, producing some errors.
The strategy for improvement is to incorporate logic to handle cases based on all input/output examples, in particular example three.
We will generate observation reports and use the iterative process to improve understanding.

**Example and Results Analysis:**
Here's a breakdown of the results, incorporating detailed observations:

**Example 0:**

*   **Input:** 6x6 grid, some 2x2 blocks contain yellow.
*   **Expected Output:** 3x3 grid, green where the 2x2 blocks in the input had yellow, other colors unchanged.
*   **Actual Output:** Matches the expected output.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   Input dimensions: 6x6
    *   Output dimensions: 3x3
    *   Correct pixels: 9/9
    *   Accuracy: 100%

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** 10x10 grid, some 2x2 blocks contain yellow.
*   **Expected Output:** 5x5 grid, green where the 2x2 blocks in the input had yellow, other colors unchanged.
*   **Actual Output:** Matches the expected output.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   Input dimensions: 10x10
    *   Output dimensions: 5x5
    *   Correct pixels: 25/25
    *   Accuracy: 100%

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** 5x5 grid. Contains yellow.
*    **Expected Output:** 3x3 grid, containing green and other colors.
*   **Actual Output:** differs from expected.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   Input dimensions: 5x5
    *   Output dimensions: 3x3
    *   Correct pixels: 7/9
    *   Accuracy: 77.78%

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example: 0
    input_grid_size: [6, 6]
    output_grid_size: [3, 3]
    block_size: [2, 2]
    consolidation_color: 3
    trigger_color: 4
    rule: "If a 2x2 block contains color 4, consolidate to color 3."
  - example: 1
    input_grid_size: [10, 10]
    output_grid_size: [5, 5]
    block_size: [2, 2]
    consolidation_color: 3
    trigger_color: 4
    rule: "If a 2x2 block contains color 4, consolidate to color 3."
  - example: 2
    input_grid_size: [5, 5]
    output_grid_size: [3, 3]
    block_size: [2, 2]
    consolidation_color: 3
    trigger_color: 4
    rule: "If a 2x2 block contains color 4, consolidate to color 3. Blocks on the right and bottom edges that are not complete 2x2 blocks maintain corresponding cell from input to output."

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Divide the input grid into non-overlapping 2x2 blocks.
2.  **Check:** For each 2x2 block, check if it contains any yellow (4) pixels.
3.  **Consolidate:** If a 2x2 block contains yellow, consolidate the entire block into a single green (3) pixel in the output grid at the corresponding block position.
4. **Maintain Border:** If the block does *not* contain yellow, maintain the original pixel color of top-left pixel of the section.
5.  **Edge Handling:** If the input grid dimensions are not even, the blocks on the right and bottom edges will be smaller than 2x2. Handle these edge cases by treating them as incomplete blocks, and if no yellow present, copy the top, left value.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
