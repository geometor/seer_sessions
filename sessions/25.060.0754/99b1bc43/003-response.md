Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a grid of various colors (represented by numbers 0-9). The output is a significantly smaller grid, seemingly derived from the input, containing only white (0) and green (3) pixels. The input grid appears to be divided into 2x2 blocks of pixels and contains distinct horizontal bands of colors. The output grid seems to consolidate some of these blocks based on color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: 9x4
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 4] # white, blue, red, yellow
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - colors: [0, 3] # white, green
  - type: block
    properties:
      - size: 2x2
      - location: varies within input_grid

actions:
  - name: consolidate
    description: Combine 2x2 blocks from input_grid into single pixels in output_grid.
    rules:
      - if 2x2 block contains any '4' (yellow): output is '3' (green).
      - else: output is all '0' (white)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Divide the input grid into non-overlapping 2x2 blocks of pixels.
2.  **Inspect:** Examine each 2x2 block.
3.  **Transform and consolidate**:
    *   If a 2x2 block contains *any* yellow (4) pixel, consolidate the entire block into a single green (3) pixel in the output grid.
    *   Otherwise, if there are no yellow cells, consolidate to white pixels (0).
4. **Output:** Construct the output grid from these consolidated pixels. The output grid will have dimensions equal to the block counts, i.e. output\_height = input\_height / block\_height; output\_width = input\_width / block\_width.

Essentially, the transformation rule is a conditional consolidation: presence of yellow dictates a green output, absence results in white. The operation occurs on 2x2 sections independently.
