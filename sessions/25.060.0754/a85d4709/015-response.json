The specific transformation seems to depend on the initial values present in the input grid. The colors, represented by digits, change from input to output based on their color and position. Specifically we see:\n- input gray (5) becomes red (2)\n- input white (0) becomes yellow (4)\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
