<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A174C5BA9D0>

**output:**
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The input grid contains only 0s (white) and 5s (gray), while the output grid contains 3s (green) and 4s (yellow). There's a clear change in colors and values, but the grid dimensions remain constant. The core challenge is to figure out the rule that dictates this color/value change.

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - name: color
        values:
          input: [0, 5]  # white, gray
          output: [3, 4] # green, yellow

actions:
  - name: transform_color
    input_grid:
       all_pixels: read
    output_grid:
      - conditions:
          - if: input pixel is 5
            then: output pixel becomes 3
          - if: input pixel is 0
            then: output pixel becomes 4
    description: Changes pixel colors based on their original value.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixel positions are preserved during transformation. The transformation is one-to-one; each input pixel corresponds directly to an output pixel at the same location.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Iteration:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   **Conditional Check:**
        *   If the pixel's value is 5 (gray), change it to 3 (green) in the output grid.
        *   If the pixel's value is 0 (white), change it to 4 (yellow) in the output grid.
3.  **Output:** The result is a 3x3 output grid where each pixel's color has been transformed according to the above rule, maintaining the original grid structure.

In simpler terms, the program replaces all gray pixels with green pixels and all white pixels with yellow pixels, keeping the positions the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
