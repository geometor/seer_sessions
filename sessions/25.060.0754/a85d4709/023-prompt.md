Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Iteration:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   **Conditional Check:**
        *   If the pixel's value is 5 (gray), change it to 3 (green) in the output grid.
        *   If the pixel's value is 0 (white), change it to 4 (yellow) in the output grid.
3.  **Output:** The result is a 3x3 output grid where each pixel's color has been transformed according to the above rule, maintaining the original grid structure.

In simpler terms, the program replaces all gray pixels with green pixels and all white pixels with yellow pixels, keeping the positions the same.

    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.

        for j in range(cols):

                output_grid[i, j] = 3  # Change to green
            elif input_grid[i, j] == 0:  # If white
                output_grid[i, j] = 4  # Change to yellow

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
