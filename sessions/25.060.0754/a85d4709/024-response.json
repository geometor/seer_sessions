Gray pixels become green, white pixels become yellow, and other colors are preserved.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input.\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Apply the transformation rules based on the input pixel's value.\n            if input_grid[i, j] == 5:  # If gray\n                output_grid[i, j] = 3  # Change to green\n            elif input_grid[i, j] == 0:  # If white\n                output_grid[i, j] = 4  # Change to yellow\n            else:\n                output_grid[i,j] = input_grid[i,j] # transfer others\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
