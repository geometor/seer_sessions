objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - name: color
        values:
          input: [0, 5]  # white, gray
          output: [3, 4] # green, yellow

actions:
  - name: transform_color
    input_grid:
       all_pixels: read
    output_grid:
      - conditions:
          - if: input pixel is 5
            then: output pixel becomes 3
          - if: input pixel is 0
            then: output pixel becomes 4
    description: Changes pixel colors based on their original value.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixel positions are preserved during transformation. The transformation is one-to-one; each input pixel corresponds directly to an output pixel at the same location.
