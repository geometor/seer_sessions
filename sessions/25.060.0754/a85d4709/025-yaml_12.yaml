  - task: color_substitution
  - input_grid_size: 3x3
  - output_grid_size: 3x3
  - color_mapping:
      original: [0, 1, 5]  # White, Blue, Gray
      transformed: [4, 1, 3] # Yellow, Blue, Green

      The output grid is the same size as the input grid.
      Pixels in the input grid are transformed based on their color:
        - Gray (5) pixels become Green (3).
        - White (0) pixels become Yellow (4).
        - Blue (1) pixels remain Blue(1).
      All pixels are processed.
