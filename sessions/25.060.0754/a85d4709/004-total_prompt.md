**input:**
```
0 0 5
0 5 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A17540FB750>

**output:**
```
3 3 3
4 4 4
2 2 2
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The input grid contains only the values 0 and 5, while the output grid contains 2, 3, and 4. The spatial arrangement is preserved (3x3 to 3x3), suggesting a per-pixel transformation rather than a rearrangement or manipulation of larger structures. The transformation seems to be a mapping of input colors to output colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_values: [0, 5]
    output_values: [2, 3, 4]
  - object: pixel
    property: color_value
    input_state: [0, 5]
    output_state: [2, 3, 4]
  - relation: spatial_correspondence
    description: "Each input pixel maps to an output pixel at the same coordinates."
  - transformation: color_mapping
    mapping:
        0: "one of: 2,3,4"
        5: "one of: 2,3,4"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Pixel-wise Transformation:** For each pixel in the input grid, determine its color value.
3.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   If the input pixel's color is 0 (white), change the output color to one of the set of output colors {2,3,4}.
    *   If the input pixel's color is 5 (gray), change the output color to one of the set of output colors {2,3,4}.
4. The ouput grid is composed of colors 2,3,4 - the input pixel on row 0 is mapped to color 3, row 1 maps to color 4 and row 2 maps to color 2.
5. **Output:** The resulting 3x3 grid is the output.

Essentially, the transformation appears to involve looking at a row at a time. Row 0 (all 0 except the top right corner) maps to 3, row 1 (all 0 except center) maps to 4 and row 2 (all 0 except the lower left) maps to 2.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
