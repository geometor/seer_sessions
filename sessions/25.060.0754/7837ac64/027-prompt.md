Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Colors:** Focus on pixels with colors '1' (blue) and '2' (red) in the input grid. Ignore '0' and '8' pixels at this stage.
2. **Remove Grid Markers**: remove the grid markers (azure color '8')
3.  **Condense Representation:** Create a much smaller output grid (3x3).
4.  **Map Extracted Colors:**
    *   If there's a blue ('1') pixel between the first and second line, place a '1' in the top-left cell (0,0) of the output grid.
    *  If there are any red ('2') pixel to the right of '1', between first and second horizontal azure line place '2' to the right of the blue in output.
    *  If there are red ('2') pixels below blue and red pixels, below the second horizontal line place '2's in the third row of the output.
    *    Fill all the empty cells between 1 and 2, with 0.
5. Fill remaining cells in output as '0'.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
