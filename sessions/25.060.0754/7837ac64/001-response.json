The input grids seem to consist of repeating patterns of colored lines, with some variations/interruptions in the pattern. The output grid seems to select specific colors from the input, but the selection criteria are not immediately obvious. It appears that the colors in the output grid correspond to the colors that *interrupt* a background pattern in the input. The output grid is always 3x3.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This pattern usually consists of horizontal lines of a single color, repeated vertically. This can be considered a 'background'.\n\n2.  **Identify the pixels that deviate** from this dominant pattern. These are pixels of colors that differ from the background, often singular occurrences or small clusters. They will be the foreground objects.\n\n3.  **Examine the disruptive pixels in a specific order:**\n    *   Top Row of the output uses the colors, from left to right, of the disruptions in rows that form the top-most repeating background pattern.\n    *   Middle Row of the output uses the colors, from left to right, of the disruptions in rows that form the middle repeating background pattern.\n    *   Bottom Row of the output uses the colors, from left to right of the disruptions in rows that form the bottom-most repeating background pattern.\n\n4. If there are no disruptive pixels in the corresponding input background area for an output, use 0 (white). If the are more than 3 disruptive pixels in the input background, use only the first 3, from left-to-right. If fewer than 3 disruptive pixels are found, fill the remaining output slots with 0.\n5.  **Construct a 3x3 output grid** where the cell values (colors) are determined by the colors of these disrupting pixels, positioned according to the rule described in step 3.\n\nEssentially, the program identifies a repeating background pattern, finds where that pattern is \"broken\" by other colors, and then uses those \"breaking\" colors to create the output grid. The output grid captures a very compressed summary of these color disruptions.\n"
