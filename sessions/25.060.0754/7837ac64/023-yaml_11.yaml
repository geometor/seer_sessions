objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns: 3
      cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - name: row
    type: 1D array
    properties:
      pixels: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    classifications:
      - magenta_row: all pixels are 6
      - green_row: all pixels are 3
      - white_row: otherwise

actions:
  - name: classify_rows
    input: input_grid
    process: |
      Iterate through each row of the input_grid.
      Classify each row based on its pixel values.
    output: list of row classifications

  - name: construct_output
    input: list of row classifications
    process: |
      Conditional logic based on presence and relative order of green and magenta rows:
      1. If at least one green row exists, the first row of the output_grid is all green (3).
      2. If at least one green row AND at least one magenta row exists, the second row of output_grid is all magenta (6).
      3. If green rows *and* magenta rows exist, and there is a green row *after* the *last* magenta row, third output row is all green(3).
      4. If *no* green rows exist, but at least one magenta row exists, the first row of the output is all magenta (6).
      5. Fill any unassigned output rows with white(0).
    output: output_grid
