Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Rows:** Examine each row of the input grid.
2.  **Classify Rows:**
    *   A row is classified as a "magenta row" if all its pixels are magenta (6).
    *   A row is classified as a "green row" if all its pixels are green (3).
    *  Otherwise the row is white
3.  **Construct Output Grid (3x3):**
    *   If any green rows exist:
        * The first row of the output grid is all green (3).
        * If a magenta row exists *anywhere* in input, the *second* output row is all magenta (6).
        * If one or more green rows exist *after* any magenta row, the *third* output row is all green (3).
    *   If NO green rows exist, but one or more magenta row exists:
        *   The first row of the output is all magenta (6).
    * All other rows of output grid are white.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
