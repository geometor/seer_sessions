actions:
  - identify: Find all rows in the input_grid.
  - classify: Classify each row as magenta_row, green_row, or white_row.
  - construct: Build the output_grid based on the classification of rows.
    - rule1: "If there are any green rows, the first row of output is green"
    - rule2: "If there is a magenta row, and at least one green row exists, then the second row of output is magenta"
    - rule3: "If there is a magenta row, and NO green rows exist, the first row of output is magenta"
    - rule4: "If there are green rows after a magenta row, the third row is green."
    - rule5: "Otherwise, the row is white"
