Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, analysis of the results, and a revised natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a very limited observation (the first training example only). It correctly identified the core concept of looking for the first occurrences of blue (1) and green (3) and placing them in a new, smaller output grid. However, it made a crucial, incorrect assumption: that the output grid would *always* be 3x3 and that blue and green would *always* be placed at (0,0) and (0,2) respectively. The results across all five training examples clearly show this is wrong. The output grid size and placement are dependent on the *relative* positions of the first blue and green pixels in the input grid. The initial implementation is therefore too rigid and needs a substantial change to its core logic. The strategy must account for the dynamic creation of output grid based on the *relative* positions found.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Dynamic Output Grid Size:** The output grid dimensions must be determined by relative positions of blue and green pixels.
2.  **Relative Positioning:** The position of the blue and green pixels within the output needs to be calculated relative to their first occurrences within the input grid. The output shape is based on the *difference* between the blue and green positions in the input grid.
3.  **Edge Cases:** consider what happens when either color is missing.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for precise reporting):**

The code execution confirms:

*   The output grid shape is *not* constant.
*   The `row_diff` and `col_diff` between the first blue and first green pixel positions in the *input* grid directly correlate with the output shape and the positions of the placed colors.
* when there are multiple occurrences of the same color, we use the first.
* when green appears before blue, the output grid is created with all rows.

**YAML Facts:**

facts:
  - object: grid
    type: input
    properties:
      - contains_colors: [blue, green, gray]
      - color_values: {blue: 1, green: 3, gray: 5}

  - object: grid
    type: output
    properties:
       - shape: determined_by_relative_positions
       - default_color: white

  - action: find_first
    description: Locate the first occurrence of specific colors (blue and green) within the input grid.
    input: input_grid, [blue, green]
    output: coordinates (row, col) for each color

  - action: create_output
    description: Create an output grid with dimensions and pixel placement based on the relative positions of the first occurrences of blue and green in the input grid.
    input: coordinates of blue, coordinates of green
    output: output_grid

  - relationship: relative_position
    description: The difference in row and column indices between the first blue pixel and the first green pixel determines output grid.
    properties:
       - row_difference: green_row - blue_row
       - col_difference: green_col - blue_col
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find First Occurrences:** Examine the input grid to find the row and column indices of the first occurrence of a blue (1) pixel and the first occurrence of a green (3) pixel.

2.  **Calculate Relative Position:**
    *   Calculate the difference in row indices (`row_diff` = green\_row - blue\_row).
    *   Calculate the difference in column indices (`col_diff` = green\_col - blue\_col).

3.  **Determine Output Grid Size:**
    *   Create a new output grid.
    * if `row_diff` is not zero: output grid is `abs(row_diff) + 1` rows
    * if `col_diff` is not zero: output grid is `abs(col_diff) + 1` columns
    * If any of `row_diff` or `col_diff` are zero, the size is determined by whichever is not zero.

4. **Populate Output Grid:**
   *    If the blue pixel was found, place a blue pixel (1) in the output grid at position (0, 0).
    *   If the green pixel was found:
        *  If the blue pixel was also found, place the green pixel (3) at the location in the output grid corresponding to the `row_diff` and `col_diff`:
           + if blue is before green: place at (row_diff, col_diff)
           + if green is before blue, iterate down the rows until green is placed.
        *   If only the green pixel was found, place green pixel (3) at (0,0).

5. **Return the output grid.**

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
