Example 1:
    Input Shape: (4, 6)
    Output Shape: (3, 3)
    Expected Output Colors and patterns: Describes a simplified version of the input. The input has one blue square and one smaller green square. The output contains just a single blue square of 3x3
    Predicted Output: 3x3 black grid
    Errors:
        - Incorrect Size
        - Incorrect Colors
        - No representation of input objects

Example 2:
    Input Shape: (10, 8)
    Output Shape: (3, 3)
    Expected Output Colors and patterns: Describes a simplified version of the input, similar to Example 1. The input seems to have a magenta "C" shaped object, the output shows a simplified 3x3 magenta box.
    Predicted Output: 3x3 black grid
    Errors:
        - Incorrect Size
        - Incorrect Colors
        - No representation of input objects

Example 3:
    Input Shape: (7, 7)
    Output Shape: (3, 3)
    Expected Output Colors and patterns: Describes a simplified version of the input. There is a red "T" in the input and the output is a solid red 3x3 box
    Predicted Output: 3x3 black grid
    Errors:
        - Incorrect Size
        - Incorrect Colors
        - No representation of input objects
