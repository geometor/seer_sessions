Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and try to understand the transformation. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A large grid (27x27) primarily composed of '0' (white) and '8' (azure) pixels. There are distinct horizontal lines of '8's and interspersed within these are a few '1' (blue) and '2' (red) pixels.
*   **Output:** A much smaller grid (3x3) containing only '0' (white), '1' (blue), and '2' (red) pixels. It seems to represent a highly condensed or abstracted version of the input. The relative positions of 1 and 2 in output seems to correspond to their positions relative to the horizontal 8 lines, and their occurrences.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve extracting specific colors ('1' and '2') from the input grid and representing them in a much smaller output grid. The white '0' pixels act as a background or default value in the output. It seems the azure '8' pixels are removed, the positions between the horizontal and vertical azure colored pixels lines that contain the blue and red pixels are extracted.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    role: default_value
  - id: grid_marker
    color: azure (8)
    role: structure_indicator
  - id: extracted_color_1
    color: blue (1)
    role: significant_element
  - id: extracted_color_2
    color: red (2)
    role: significant_element

actions:
  - name: extract
    description: Isolate specific colored pixels.
  - name: condense
    description: Represent the extracted pixels in a smaller grid.
 - name: remove_color
    description: Remove the azure colored pixels.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The relative positions of the '1' and '2' pixels within the '8' structures in the input are somewhat maintained in the output, although greatly simplified.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Colors:** Focus on pixels with colors '1' (blue) and '2' (red) in the input grid. Ignore '0' and '8' pixels at this stage.
2. **Remove Grid Markers**: remove the grid markers (azure color '8')
3.  **Condense Representation:** Create a much smaller output grid (3x3).
4.  **Map Extracted Colors:**
    *   If there's a blue ('1') pixel between the first and second line, place a '1' in the top-left cell (0,0) of the output grid.
    *  If there are any red ('2') pixel to the right of '1', between first and second horizontal azure line place '2' to the right of the blue in output.
    *  If there are red ('2') pixels below blue and red pixels, below the second horizontal line place '2's in the third row of the output.
    *    Fill all the empty cells between 1 and 2, with 0.
5. Fill remaining cells in output as '0'.

In essence, the program extracts the '1' and '2' pixels and creates a minimalist representation of their relative positions in the original grid, discarding the '8' background structure and much of the spatial information. The output gives minimal positional information of the key colored pixels relative to each other.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
