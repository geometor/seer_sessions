            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and try to discern the underlying transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe input appears to be a large, square grid (29x29) filled primarily with the values 0 (white) and 4 (yellow). There are also a few instances of 1 (blue) and 3 (green). The output is a much smaller 3x3 grid containing only 0, 1, and 3.  The input's most prominent feature is the repeating vertical lines of yellow (4) against a white (0) background. These lines are interrupted by horizontal yellow lines, creating a sort of grid or maze-like structure. Within this structure, there are \"islands\" of blue (1) and green (3) pixels. The output's small size suggests a significant compression or summarization of the input data.\n\nThe transformation does *not* appear to be a simple sub-sampling, cropping, or rotation, as there is no obvious visual correlation in those terms.  The presence of 1 and 3 in the output, matching colors in the input, hints at a selection or counting process. The output size (3x3) may relate to a region within input. The output includes a green and blue, where the first occurence from top-left are seen together.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The objective is that there are not many pixels before the green and the blue pixels, and that the distance between the top left corner to the green and blue should be small.\n3. **Extract:** Create the output by keeping the first occurence of the color 1 and 3, replace everything else with 0.\n\nEssentially, the program finds the first occurrence of blue and green colors in the top-left region, and constructs a 3x3 grid representing a \"snapshot\" of this area.\n"
