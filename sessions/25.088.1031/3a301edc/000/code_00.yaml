task_description: "Fill the bounding box of the non-white object(s) with the 'inner' color."

elements:
  - element: "grid"
    description: "A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors."
  - element: "background"
    properties:
      - color: "white"
      - value: 0
  - element: "object"
    description: "A contiguous region of non-white pixels."
    properties:
      - colors: "One or more non-white colors (1-9)."
      - structure: "Often consists of an 'outer' color adjacent to the background and an 'inner' color surrounded by the 'outer' color."
  - element: "bounding_box"
    description: "The smallest rectangle enclosing all non-white pixels in the input grid."
  - element: "inner_color"
    description: "The non-white color within the object that is not adjacent (including diagonals) to any background (white) pixels. If all non-white colors are adjacent to the background (e.g., a single-color object), this is simply the object's color."
  - element: "fill_action"
    description: "The action of changing the color of pixels within a specified region."

relationships:
  - type: "containment"
    source: "bounding_box"
    target: "object"
    description: "The bounding box encloses the object."
  - type: "determination"
    source: "object"
    target: "inner_color"
    description: "The structure and colors of the object determine the inner color."
  - type: "spatial_modification"
    action: "fill_action"
    region: "bounding_box"
    condition: "pixel is white in input"
    fill_value: "inner_color"
    output_effect: "White pixels inside the bounding box are replaced with the inner color."
