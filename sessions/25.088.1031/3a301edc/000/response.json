            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grids:** The input grids contain a background of white pixels (0) and one or more contiguous regions (objects) composed of non-white pixels.\n2.  **Objects:** The central non-white objects often consist of two distinct colors: one forming an outer layer or frame, and another forming an inner core or pattern. In some cases (like train\\_2 and train\\_5), the inner \"object\" is just a single pixel.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves modifying the area *around* the existing non-white object(s) but within a specific boundary. The original non-white pixels retain their positions and colors in the output.\n4.  **Bounding Box:** The area of modification appears to be defined by the minimal bounding box that encloses all non-white pixels from the input grid.\n5.  **Fill Color:** The white pixels *within* this bounding box are filled with a specific color in the output grid. This fill color seems to be determined by the color of the \"inner\" part of the object in the input grid. The \"inner\" color can be identified as the non-white color whose pixels are *not* adjacent (including diagonally) to the background white pixels. If the object is made of only one color, that color is used as the fill color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
