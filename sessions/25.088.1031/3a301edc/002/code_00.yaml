task_description: Fill an expanded bounding box area around a central figure with a specific color derived from the figure's center, where the expansion amount depends on the figure's outer frame color.

definitions:
  - name: background_color
    value: 0 (white)
  - name: figure
    description: The contiguous or non-contiguous set of all non-background pixels in the input grid.
  - name: figure_bounding_box
    description: The minimal bounding box enclosing all pixels belonging to the figure.
    properties: [min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col]
  - name: figure_center
    description: The geometric center coordinates of the figure_bounding_box. May fall between pixels.
  - name: fill_color
    description: The color used to fill the expanded area.
    determination: The color of the input pixel(s) at the figure_center. If the center falls between multiple pixels, use their shared color (if uniform) or apply a tie-breaker (e.g., most frequent color within the central 2x2 area, or simply the color at floor(center_row), floor(center_col)). All examples provided have a clear or uniform center color.
  - name: frame_color
    description: The color of the figure's pixels that are directly adjacent (8-way) to the background_color.
    determination: Identify all non-background pixels adjacent to a background_color pixel. In the provided examples, only one such color exists per example. If multiple exist, a priority rule might be needed (e.g., most frequent).
  - name: expansion_amount (N)
    description: The number of pixels by which the figure_bounding_box is expanded in each cardinal direction.
    determination: Based on the value of the frame_color according to the observed mapping {1:1, 3:1, 4:2, 5:3, 6:2}. Any other frame_color values encountered would need a default or inferred rule.
  - name: expanded_bounding_box
    description: The area within which filling occurs.
    calculation: (figure_bounding_box.min_row - N, figure_bounding_box.max_row + N, figure_bounding_box.min_col - N, figure_bounding_box.max_col + N), clamped to grid boundaries.
  - name: fill_operation
    description: Change the color of pixels within the expanded_bounding_box.
    condition: Only pixels that are originally background_color in the input grid are changed.
    result: Affected pixels are set to the fill_color.
