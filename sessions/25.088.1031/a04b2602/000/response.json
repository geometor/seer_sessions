The output grids show that some of the green pixels have been changed to blue (1), while the red pixels and the background remain unchanged. The transformation appears localized around the red pixels. Specifically, green pixels that are directly adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to any red pixel in the input grid are changed to blue in the output grid. All other pixels, including the red pixels themselves and green pixels not adjacent to red pixels, keep their original color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
