elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: region
    color: green (3)
    description: Contiguous or semi-contiguous areas of green pixels.
  - type: point
    color: red (2)
    description: Individual or small groups of red pixels, often located within or near green regions.
  - type: point
    color: blue (1)
    description: Appears only in the output grid, replacing some green pixels.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share an edge or a corner (orthogonal or diagonal neighbors).
  - type: spatial_proximity
    description: Red pixels are located near or within green regions.

transformation:
  - action: color_change
    input_object: green (3) pixel
    condition: The green pixel is adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to at least one red (2) pixel in the input grid.
    output_object: blue (1) pixel
  - action: preserve_color
    input_object: Any pixel (white, red, or green)
    condition: The pixel is NOT a green (3) pixel adjacent to a red (2) pixel.
    output_object: The pixel retains its original color.
