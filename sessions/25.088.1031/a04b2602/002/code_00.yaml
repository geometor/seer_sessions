task_description: Change the color of certain green pixels to blue based on their proximity to red pixels.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: variable height and width (up to 30x30)
  - background_color: white (0) appears frequently as background.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3) are the primary colors involved. Other colors might appear but seem unchanged.
  - type: region
    properties:
      - color: contiguous areas of green (3) pixels.
      - color: isolated or grouped red (2) pixels.
actions:
  - name: color_change
    input_object: green pixels (3)
    output_object: blue pixels (1)
    trigger: Proximity to red pixels (2)
    condition:
      - The green pixel must belong to a contiguous region of green pixels that is "infected" by an adjacent red pixel.
      - Adjacency includes orthogonal and diagonal neighbors (8-way).
      - The change propagates: A green pixel turns blue if it's adjacent to a red pixel OR adjacent to another green pixel that has already turned blue during the process.
uncertainties:
  - Are there edge cases or specific configurations where a green pixel adjacent to red does *not* turn blue (as suggested by the 3 errors: Expected=3, Transformed=1)? The current hypothesis assumes all adjacent green pixels initiate or continue the propagation.
final_state:
  - Red pixels remain unchanged.
  - White background pixels remain unchanged.
  - Green pixels not reachable by propagation from a red pixel remain unchanged.
  - Affected green pixels become blue.
