Identify all separate connected components (objects) consisting of green (3) pixels in the input grid.\n    3.  For each identified green object:\n        a.  Determine the object's bounding box (minimum row/col, maximum row/col).\n        b.  Analyze the object's properties within its bounding box:\n            i.  Check if it's \"bottom-heavy\": It touches the bottom edge (`max_row`) of its bounding box but does not touch the top edge (`min_row`).\n            ii. Check if it \"has a hole\": It encloses one or more white (0) pixels within its shape.\n            iii.Check if it \"has a stem\": The number of green pixels belonging to the object in the bottom row (`max_row`) of its bounding box is exactly 1 or 2.\n        c.  Determine the placement for the copy:\n            i.  If the object is \"bottom-heavy\", the copy location starts 1 row below the object's bounding box (`max_row + 2`).\n            ii. Otherwise (not \"bottom-heavy\"), the copy location starts 1 column to the right of the object's bounding box (`max_col + 2`).\n        d.  Determine the color for the copy:\n            i.  If the placement is to the Right: The copy color is blue (1).\n            ii. If the placement is Below:\n                1.  If the object \"has a hole\" AND \"has a stem\": The copy color is blue (1).\n                2.  Otherwise (placed Below, but doesn't have both hole and stem): The copy color is azure (8).\n        e.  Create the copy: Iterate through the original object's pixels relative to its top-left corner. For each green pixel in the original object, draw a pixel of the determined copy color at the corresponding relative position offset by the calculated copy start location (determined in step 3c) onto the output grid. Ensure not to overwrite existing green pixels."
