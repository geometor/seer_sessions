"""
Identifies regions enclosed by azure (8) pixels.
For each enclosed region containing red (2) pixels:
1. Finds the bounding box of the red pixels within that region.
2. Fills the area within this bounding box with red (2), but only for pixels that were part of the original enclosed region (i.e., not the azure border or pixels outside the region).
Pixels outside enclosed regions or in enclosed regions without red pixels remain unchanged.
The azure (8) borders remain unchanged.
