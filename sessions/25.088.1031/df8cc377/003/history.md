Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: cannot unpack non-iterable bool object

## Example 2:
Error: cannot unpack non-iterable bool object

## Example 3:
Error: cannot unpack non-iterable bool object
Okay, let's analyze the situation and refine the approach.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The primary issue causing the immediate errors is a `TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable bool object`. This occurs because the `is_hollow_rectangle` function was designed to return `False` when an object wasn't a valid hollow rectangle, but the calling code always expected three values (`is_rect, bbox, interior_coords`).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Fix `is_hollow_rectangle`:** Modify the function to consistently return a 3-tuple, even in failure cases (e.g., `(False, None, None)` or `(False, bbox, None)` where appropriate). This will resolve the `TypeError`.
2.  **Validate Assumptions:** Re-examine the core logic against all training examples. The core assumptions appear to be:
    *   Exactly two hollow rectangles with single-pixel-thick borders exist.
    *   Exactly two distinct colors of single, scattered pixels exist *outside* these rectangles.
    *   Scattered pixels are removed.
    *   Rectangle interiors are filled with a checkerboard pattern.
    *   Fill colors are derived from the scattered pixel colors, swapped between the rectangles based on the order they or their colors are found.
    *   The checkerboard starts with the fill color in the top-left interior cell.
3.  **Refine Implementation:** Ensure the code correctly identifies rectangles and scattered pixels, handles the color swapping, and applies the checkerboard fill accurately based on the relative coordinates within each rectangle's interior.

## Metrics and Verification

Based on the visual description of the examples (since I cannot execute code to inspect the `task` object directly here):

*   **Objects:** Each example consistently presents two primary objects identifiable as hollow rectangles with distinct border colors. Other objects are single pixels of two further distinct colors.
*   **Properties:**
    *   Rectangles: Axis-aligned, single-pixel border, white interior initially.
    *   Scattered Pixels: Single cell size, located outside the rectangles' bounding boxes.
*   **Counts:** Consistently 2 rectangles and 2 colors of scattered pixels across examples.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Removal: Scattered pixels are removed (set to white).
    *   Filling: Rectangle interiors are filled.
    *   Pattern: Checkerboard (fill color / white).
    *   Color Assignment: The color used to fill Rectangle A is the color of the scattered pixels associated with Rectangle B, and vice-versa (swapped). The "first" and "second" rectangle/scattered color likely corresponds to the order encountered during grid traversal (top-down, left-right).
    *   Checkerboard Start: The top-left cell *inside* the rectangle border receives the fill color. Subsequent interior cells alternate based on `(row_delta + col_delta) % 2`.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
task_description: Fill the interior of two hollow rectangles with checkerboard patterns derived from swapped colors of scattered pixels found outside the rectangles.

definitions:
  - object: Rectangle
    properties:
      - type: Hollow Shape
      - border: Single pixel thick, single color (Color R1 for Rect 1, Color R2 for Rect 2)
      - interior: Initially white (Color 0)
      - count: 2 per grid
  - object: Scattered Pixel
    properties:
      - type: Single Pixel
      - location: Outside the bounding boxes of the Rectangles
      - color: Two distinct colors present (Color S1, Color S2)
      - count: At least one pixel of each color S1 and S2 exists.
      - contiguity: Non-contiguous with other pixels of the same or different scattered color.

actions:
  - action: Identify Rectangles
    inputs: Input Grid
    outputs: Two Rectangle objects (Rect1, Rect2), including border color, coordinates, interior coordinates, top-left interior coordinate.
  - action: Identify Scattered Pixels
    inputs: Input Grid, identified Rectangle objects
    outputs: Two sets of scattered pixel coordinates, grouped by color (Pixels S1, Pixels S2), and the ordered colors (Color S1, Color S2).
    constraints: Pixels must be outside rectangle bounding boxes, single-cell objects.
  - action: Remove Scattered Pixels
    inputs: Output Grid (copy of input), identified Scattered Pixel coordinates
    outputs: Modified Output Grid with scattered pixels set to white (Color 0).
  - action: Determine Fill Colors
    inputs: Rectangle border colors (Color R1, Color R2), Scattered pixel colors (Color S1, Color S2)
    outputs: Fill color mapping.
    logic: Fill color for Rect1 is Color S2. Fill color for Rect2 is Color S1. (Assumes order found defines 1 and 2).
  - action: Fill Rectangle Interiors
    inputs: Output Grid, Rectangle interior coordinates, top-left interior coordinate for each rectangle, assigned Fill Colors.
    outputs: Final Output Grid.
    logic:
      - For each rectangle:
        - Iterate through its interior coordinates (r, c).
        - Let (r_start, c_start) be the top-left interior coordinate.
        - Calculate relative checkerboard index: `idx = (r - r_start) + (c - c_start)`.
        - If `idx % 2 == 0`, set grid[r, c] to the rectangle's assigned Fill Color.
        - If `idx % 2 != 0`, set grid[r, c] to white (Color 0).

sequence:
  1. Identify the two Rectangles.
  2. Identify the two colors of Scattered Pixels outside the rectangles.
  3. Create a copy of the input grid.
  4. Remove the Scattered Pixels from the copied grid.
  5. Determine the swapped fill colors for the rectangles.
  6. Fill the interior of each rectangle with the appropriate checkerboard pattern using its assigned fill color.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify** the two distinct hollow rectangles in the input grid, noting their border colors, border coordinates, and interior coordinates. Determine the top-left coordinate of each rectangle's interior.
2.  **Identify** all single pixels located *outside* the bounding boxes of the two identified rectangles. Find the two distinct colors present among these scattered pixels. Record these two colors, maintaining the order in which they were first encountered (e.g., during a top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan).
3.  **Prepare** the output grid by creating a copy of the input grid.
4.  **Remove** the identified scattered pixels from the output grid by changing their color to white (0).
5.  **Assign** fill colors: The first rectangle identified will be filled using the *second* scattered pixel color found. The second rectangle identified will be filled using the *first* scattered pixel color found.
6.  **Fill** the interior of each rectangle: For every cell within the rectangle's interior, calculate its position relative to the top-left interior cell (`row_delta = current_row - top_left_interior_row`, `col_delta = current_col - top_left_interior_col`). If `(row_delta + col_delta)` is even, color the cell with the rectangle's assigned fill color. If it's odd, color the cell white (0).
7.  **Output** the modified grid.
