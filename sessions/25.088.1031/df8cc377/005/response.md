"""
Fill the interior of two hollow rectangles with checkerboard patterns derived from the colors of scattered pixels found outside the rectangles, after removing those scattered pixels.

The assignment of the fill color depends on the count of scattered pixels: the first rectangle found (by top-left border coordinate) is filled with the color that has fewer scattered pixels, and the second rectangle is filled with the color that has more scattered pixels.

1.  Identify all connected objects of non-white pixels.
2.  Identify exactly two objects that are hollow rectangles (1-pixel border, white interior, min 3x3 size).
3.  Sort these two rectangles based on their top-left border coordinate (row-major).
4.  Identify all single-pixel objects (scattered pixels) that lie outside the border and interior of the two rectangles.
5.  Verify there are exactly two distinct colors among these valid scattered pixels.
6.  Count the occurrences of each of the two scattered colors.
7.  Create a copy of the input grid.
8.  Remove the valid scattered pixels from the copied grid (set to white).
9.  Assign fill colors: The color with the smaller count fills the first rectangle; the color with the larger count fills the second rectangle.
10. Fill the interior of the first rectangle with a checkerboard pattern using its assigned fill color.
11. Fill the interior of the second rectangle with a checkerboard pattern using its assigned fill color.
12. Return the modified grid.
