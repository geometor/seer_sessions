These pixels appear outside the rectangles.\n    *   The output grids retain the original hollow rectangular shapes.\n    *   The scattered single pixels from the input are removed in the output.\n    *   The interior area of each hollow rectangle is filled with a checkerboard pattern.\n    *   The color used for the checkerboard fill in one rectangle corresponds to the color of the scattered pixels associated with the *other* rectangle in the input. For instance, in train\\_1, the green pixels (3) fill the azure rectangle (8), and the magenta pixels (6) fill the yellow rectangle (4).\n    *   The checkerboard pattern alternates between the fill color and the background color (white), starting with the fill color at the top-left interior cell of the rectangle.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Identify the two distinct hollow rectangular shapes based on their single-color borders enclosing a white area. Record their border colors and bounding boxes.\n    3.  Identify all single, non-white pixels that are not part of the borders of the identified rectangles. Record the two distinct colors found among these scattered pixels (let's call them `fill_color_A` and `fill_color_B`).\n    4.  Remove all identified scattered pixels from the output grid (change their color to white).\n    5.  Assign one fill color to each rectangle for the filling process. The rule observed is that the color found scattered in the input is used to fill the *other* rectangle. (e.g., If `rect_1` and `rect_2` are the rectangles, and `fill_color_A` and `fill_color_B` are the scattered colors, `rect_1` will be filled using `fill_color_B`, and `rect_2` will be filled using `fill_color_A`).\n    6.  For the first rectangle:\n        a.  Determine the coordinates of its interior region (the white pixels immediately inside the border).\n        b.  Find the top-left coordinate `(r_start, c_start)` of this interior region.\n        c.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` within the interior region.\n        d.  Calculate the checkerboard index: `index = (r - r_start) + (c - c_start)`.\n        e.  If `index` is even, set the color of the cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to the assigned fill color for this rectangle.\n        f.  If `index` is odd, ensure the color of the cell `(r, c)` in the output grid is white (0).\n    7.  Repeat step 6 for the second rectangle, using its corresponding assigned fill color.\n    8.  Return the modified output grid."
