*   **Perception of the Elements:**
    *   The input grids contain multiple distinct elements:
        *   Two hollow rectangular shapes, each defined by a single border color (e.g., azure and yellow in train\_1, red and green in train\_2, blue and azure in train\_3).
        *   Scattered single pixels of two different colors, distinct from the rectangle border colors and the background (white). These pixels appear outside the rectangles.
    *   The output grids retain the original hollow rectangular shapes.
    *   The scattered single pixels from the input are removed in the output.
    *   The interior area of each hollow rectangle is filled with a checkerboard pattern.
    *   The color used for the checkerboard fill in one rectangle corresponds to the color of the scattered pixels associated with the *other* rectangle in the input. For instance, in train\_1, the green pixels (3) fill the azure rectangle (8), and the magenta pixels (6) fill the yellow rectangle (4).
    *   The checkerboard pattern alternates between the fill color and the background color (white), starting with the fill color at the top-left interior cell of the rectangle.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - type: grid
        description: Represents the input and output state.
      - type: hollow_rectangle
        count: 2
        properties:
          - border_color: A single color forming the perimeter.
          - interior_color: white (0).
          - shape: Rectangular outline, 1 pixel thick.
      - type: scattered_pixel
        description: Single pixels not part of the rectangles.
        count: Variable, but representing exactly two distinct colors per input example.
        properties:
          - color: A single color, different from rectangle borders and background.
          - location: Outside the hollow rectangles.
    relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: Scattered pixels are located outside the hollow rectangles.
      - type: association
        description: Each of the two scattered pixel colors is associated with one of the two rectangles (specifically, the one it will fill). The color associated with rectangle A is used to fill rectangle B, and vice-versa.
    actions:
      - action: identify
        target: hollow_rectangles
        details: Locate the two rectangular shapes based on their border color and white interior.
      - action: identify
        target: scattered_pixels
        details: Locate all single, non-white pixels outside the identified rectangles. Determine the two distinct colors present among these pixels.
      - action: remove
        target: scattered_pixels
        details: Exclude the scattered pixels from the output grid.
      - action: fill_interior
        target: hollow_rectangles
        details: Fill the area inside the border of each rectangle.
        using: checkerboard_pattern
        parameters:
          - fill_color: The color of the scattered pixels associated with the *other* rectangle.
          - background_color: white (0).
          - start_position: Top-left interior cell of the rectangle.
          - pattern_rule: Color the cell `(r, c)` with the `fill_color` if `(r - r_start) + (c - c_start)` is even, where `(r_start, c_start)` is the top-left interior coordinate. Otherwise, leave it as `background_color`.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the two distinct hollow rectangular shapes based on their single-color borders enclosing a white area. Record their border colors and bounding boxes.
    3.  Identify all single, non-white pixels that are not part of the borders of the identified rectangles. Record the two distinct colors found among these scattered pixels (let's call them `fill_color_A` and `fill_color_B`).
    4.  Remove all identified scattered pixels from the output grid (change their color to white).
    5.  Assign one fill color to each rectangle for the filling process. The rule observed is that the color found scattered in the input is used to fill the *other* rectangle. (e.g., If `rect_1` and `rect_2` are the rectangles, and `fill_color_A` and `fill_color_B` are the scattered colors, `rect_1` will be filled using `fill_color_B`, and `rect_2` will be filled using `fill_color_A`).
    6.  For the first rectangle:
        a.  Determine the coordinates of its interior region (the white pixels immediately inside the border).
        b.  Find the top-left coordinate `(r_start, c_start)` of this interior region.
        c.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` within the interior region.
        d.  Calculate the checkerboard index: `index = (r - r_start) + (c - c_start)`.
        e.  If `index` is even, set the color of the cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to the assigned fill color for this rectangle.
        f.  If `index` is odd, ensure the color of the cell `(r, c)` in the output grid is white (0).
    7.  Repeat step 6 for the second rectangle, using its corresponding assigned fill color.
    8.  Return the modified output grid.
