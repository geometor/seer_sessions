**Confirmation:** The code execution confirms the counts (Azure: 5, Yellow: 7) and the rectangle order (Red first, Green second). The hypothesis holds: Fill the first rectangle (Red) with the color having fewer scattered pixels (Azure), and fill the second rectangle (Green) with the color having more scattered pixels (Yellow). This matches the expected output for Example 2.

*(Self-correction on counts during manual analysis vs code execution: The code found 5 Azure and 7 Yellow scattered pixels. My manual count was slightly off, but the principle (Azure has fewer, Yellow has more) remains the same and leads to the correct assignment)*.## General Assessment

The provided code successfully solves examples 1 and 3 but fails on example 2. The failure involves incorrect colors being used for the checkerboard fill pattern inside the two hollow rectangles.

*   **Observation:** Examples 1 and 3 passed because the simple "swap colors based on scan order" logic coincidentally produced the correct result. Example 2 reveals this logic is flawed.
*   **Error Analysis:** In example 2, the code fills the first-found rectangle (Red border) with the second-found scattered color (Yellow) and the second-found rectangle (Green border) with the first-found scattered color (Azure). However, the expected output requires the Red rectangle to be filled with Azure and the Green rectangle with Yellow.
*   **Strategy:** The assignment of fill colors to rectangles needs refinement. Instead of relying on the scan order of the *scattered colors*, we should investigate other properties linking the rectangles and scattered colors. A plausible hypothesis is that the assignment depends on the *quantity* of scattered pixels of each color. The metrics gathered below support this. The rectangle identified first (by top-left coordinate) should be filled with the scattered color type that has *fewer* instances, and the second rectangle should be filled with the scattered color type that has *more* instances.

## Metrics

| Example | Rectangle 1 Border (Order Found) | Rectangle 2 Border (Order Found) | Scattered Color 1 (Name) | Scattered Color 1 (Count) | Scattered Color 2 (Name) | Scattered Color 2 (Count) | Rect 1 Fill (Expected) | Rect 2 Fill (Expected) | Hypothesis Check (Rect1=Fewer, Rect2=More) |
| :------ | :------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------- | :------------------------ | :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Azure (8)                        | Yellow (4)                       | Magenta (6)              | 12                        | Green (3)                | 5                         | Green (3)              | Magenta (6)            | Pass (Azure gets Green, Yellow gets Magenta) |
| 2       | Red (2)                          | Green (3)                        | Azure (8)                | 5                         | Yellow (4)               | 7                         | Azure (8)              | Yellow (4)             | Pass (Red gets Azure, Green gets Yellow)       |
| 3       | Blue (1)                         | Azure (8)                        | Red (2)                  | 2                         | Yellow (4)               | 1                         | Yellow (4)             | Red (2)                | Pass (Blue gets Yellow, Azure gets Red)      |

*Note: The "Order Found" for rectangles is based on the top-left coordinate (row-major). The "Scattered Color" order is based on the first pixel encountered during a scan, but the relevant metric is their total count.*
*Note: Code execution confirmed counts for Example 2 as Azure=5, Yellow=7.*

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Fill the interior of two hollow rectangles with checkerboard patterns derived from the colors of scattered pixels found outside the rectangles, after removing those scattered pixels.

definitions:
  hollow_rectangle: An object consisting of a single-pixel-thick border of a uniform color, surrounding an interior region of white pixels. Must be at least 3x3 in total size.
  scattered_pixel: A single pixel of a non-white color that is not part of the border or interior of any identified hollow rectangle.
  checkerboard_pattern: An alternating pattern of a fill color and white (background), starting with the fill color at the top-left interior cell. Placement is determined by `(row_index + col_index) % 2`.

input_features:
  - two hollow rectangles, each with a unique border color.
  - multiple single scattered pixels of exactly two distinct colors, located outside the rectangles.

transformations:
  - Identify the two hollow rectangles and their properties (border color, interior coordinates, top-left interior cell, top-left border cell).
  - Identify all single scattered pixels outside the rectangles.
  - Group scattered pixels by color and count the number of pixels for each of the two colors.
  - Determine which scattered color has fewer pixels and which has more.
  - Remove all identified scattered pixels from the grid (set to white).
  - Identify the "first" rectangle based on the top-left coordinate of its border (row-major order).
  - Identify the "second" rectangle similarly.
  - Fill the interior of the first rectangle with a checkerboard pattern using the scattered color that had *fewer* pixels.
  - Fill the interior of the second rectangle with a checkerboard pattern using the scattered color that had *more* pixels.
  - The checkerboard fill starts with the fill color at the top-left interior coordinate of each rectangle.

output_features:
  - The grid containing the original two rectangles, now with filled interiors.
  - The scattered pixels are removed.
  - The fill pattern is a checkerboard.
  - The fill color assignment depends on the relative counts of the two types of scattered pixels and the order the rectangles are found.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects:**
    *   Find all connected components of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    *   Identify exactly two components that form hollow rectangles (single-pixel border, white interior, minimum 3x3 size). Record their border colors, border coordinates, interior coordinates, and the top-left coordinate of their borders.
    *   Determine the "first" and "second" rectangle based on their top-left border coordinates (scan top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).
    *   Identify all single-pixel components (scattered pixels).
    *   Filter the scattered pixels to include only those lying outside the border and interior areas of the two identified rectangles.
    *   Verify that these remaining scattered pixels belong to exactly two distinct colors.
2.  **Analyze Scattered Pixels:**
    *   Count the number of scattered pixels for each of the two distinct colors found.
    *   Identify which color corresponds to the smaller count and which to the larger count.
3.  **Modify Grid:**
    *   Create a copy of the input grid.
    *   Set the color of all identified scattered pixels (those outside the rectangles) to white (0) in the copied grid.
4.  **Fill Rectangles:**
    *   Determine the top-left interior coordinate for the *first* identified rectangle. Fill its interior coordinates with a checkerboard pattern, using the scattered color associated with the *smaller* count as the fill color. The pattern starts with the fill color at the top-left interior cell.
    *   Determine the top-left interior coordinate for the *second* identified rectangle. Fill its interior coordinates with a checkerboard pattern, using the scattered color associated with the *larger* count as the fill color. The pattern starts with the fill color at the top-left interior cell.
5.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.
