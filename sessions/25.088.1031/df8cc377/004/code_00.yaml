task_description: Fill the interior of two hollow rectangles with checkerboard patterns derived from the colors of scattered pixels found outside the rectangles, after removing those scattered pixels.

definitions:
  hollow_rectangle: An object consisting of a single-pixel-thick border of a uniform color, surrounding an interior region of white pixels. Must be at least 3x3 in total size.
  scattered_pixel: A single pixel of a non-white color that is not part of the border or interior of any identified hollow rectangle.
  checkerboard_pattern: An alternating pattern of a fill color and white (background), starting with the fill color at the top-left interior cell. Placement is determined by `(row_index + col_index) % 2`.

input_features:
  - two hollow rectangles, each with a unique border color.
  - multiple single scattered pixels of exactly two distinct colors, located outside the rectangles.

transformations:
  - Identify the two hollow rectangles and their properties (border color, interior coordinates, top-left interior cell, top-left border cell).
  - Identify all single scattered pixels outside the rectangles.
  - Group scattered pixels by color and count the number of pixels for each of the two colors.
  - Determine which scattered color has fewer pixels and which has more.
  - Remove all identified scattered pixels from the grid (set to white).
  - Identify the "first" rectangle based on the top-left coordinate of its border (row-major order).
  - Identify the "second" rectangle similarly.
  - Fill the interior of the first rectangle with a checkerboard pattern using the scattered color that had *fewer* pixels.
  - Fill the interior of the second rectangle with a checkerboard pattern using the scattered color that had *more* pixels.
  - The checkerboard fill starts with the fill color at the top-left interior coordinate of each rectangle.

output_features:
  - The grid containing the original two rectangles, now with filled interiors.
  - The scattered pixels are removed.
  - The fill pattern is a checkerboard.
  - The fill color assignment depends on the relative counts of the two types of scattered pixels and the order the rectangles are found.
