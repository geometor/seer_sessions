            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and refine the approach.\n\n## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe primary issue causing the immediate errors is a `TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable bool object`. This occurs because the `is_hollow_rectangle` function was designed to return `False` when an object wasn't a valid hollow rectangle, but the calling code always expected three values (`is_rect, bbox, interior_coords`).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Fix `is_hollow_rectangle`:** Modify the function to consistently return a 3-tuple, even in failure cases (e.g., `(False, None, None)` or `(False, bbox, None)` where appropriate). This will resolve the `TypeError`.\n2.  **Validate Assumptions:** Re-examine the core logic against all training examples. The core assumptions appear to be:\n    *   Exactly two hollow rectangles with single-pixel-thick borders exist.\n    *   Exactly two distinct colors of single, scattered pixels exist *outside* these rectangles.\n    *   Scattered pixels are removed.\n    *   Rectangle interiors are filled with a checkerboard pattern.\n    *   Fill colors are derived from the scattered pixel colors, swapped between the rectangles based on the order they or their colors are found.\n    *   The checkerboard starts with the fill color in the top-left interior cell.\n3.  **Refine Implementation:** Ensure the code correctly identifies rectangles and scattered pixels, handles the color swapping, and applies the checkerboard fill accurately based on the relative coordinates within each rectangle's interior.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nBased on the visual description of the examples (since I cannot execute code to inspect the `task` object directly here):\n\n*   **Objects:** Each example consistently presents two primary objects identifiable as hollow rectangles with distinct border colors. Other objects are single pixels of two further distinct colors.\n*   **Properties:**\n    *   Rectangles: Axis-aligned, single-pixel border, white interior initially.\n    *   Scattered Pixels: Single cell size, located outside the rectangles' bounding boxes.\n*   **Counts:** Consistently 2 rectangles and 2 colors of scattered pixels across examples.\n*   **Actions:**\n    *   Removal: Scattered pixels are removed (set to white).\n    *   Filling: Rectangle interiors are filled.\n    *   Pattern: Checkerboard (fill color / white).\n    *   Color Assignment: The color used to fill Rectangle A is the color of the scattered pixels associated with Rectangle B, and vice-versa (swapped). The \"first\" and \"second\" rectangle/scattered color likely corresponds to the order encountered during grid traversal (top-down, left-right).\n    *   Checkerboard Start: The top-left cell *inside* the rectangle border receives the fill color. Subsequent interior cells alternate based on `(row_delta + col_delta) % 2`.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"

The second rectangle identified will be filled using the *first* scattered pixel color found.\n6.  **Fill** the interior of each rectangle: For every cell within the rectangle's interior, calculate its position relative to the top-left interior cell (`row_delta = current_row - top_left_interior_row`, `col_delta = current_col - top_left_interior_col`). If `(row_delta + col_delta)` is even, color the cell with the rectangle's assigned fill color. If it's odd, color the cell white (0).\n7.  **Output** the modified grid."
