task_description: Fill the interior of two hollow rectangles with checkerboard patterns derived from swapped colors of scattered pixels found outside the rectangles.

definitions:
  - object: Rectangle
    properties:
      - type: Hollow Shape
      - border: Single pixel thick, single color (Color R1 for Rect 1, Color R2 for Rect 2)
      - interior: Initially white (Color 0)
      - count: 2 per grid
  - object: Scattered Pixel
    properties:
      - type: Single Pixel
      - location: Outside the bounding boxes of the Rectangles
      - color: Two distinct colors present (Color S1, Color S2)
      - count: At least one pixel of each color S1 and S2 exists.
      - contiguity: Non-contiguous with other pixels of the same or different scattered color.

actions:
  - action: Identify Rectangles
    inputs: Input Grid
    outputs: Two Rectangle objects (Rect1, Rect2), including border color, coordinates, interior coordinates, top-left interior coordinate.
  - action: Identify Scattered Pixels
    inputs: Input Grid, identified Rectangle objects
    outputs: Two sets of scattered pixel coordinates, grouped by color (Pixels S1, Pixels S2), and the ordered colors (Color S1, Color S2).
    constraints: Pixels must be outside rectangle bounding boxes, single-cell objects.
  - action: Remove Scattered Pixels
    inputs: Output Grid (copy of input), identified Scattered Pixel coordinates
    outputs: Modified Output Grid with scattered pixels set to white (Color 0).
  - action: Determine Fill Colors
    inputs: Rectangle border colors (Color R1, Color R2), Scattered pixel colors (Color S1, Color S2)
    outputs: Fill color mapping.
    logic: Fill color for Rect1 is Color S2. Fill color for Rect2 is Color S1. (Assumes order found defines 1 and 2).
  - action: Fill Rectangle Interiors
    inputs: Output Grid, Rectangle interior coordinates, top-left interior coordinate for each rectangle, assigned Fill Colors.
    outputs: Final Output Grid.
    logic:
      - For each rectangle:
        - Iterate through its interior coordinates (r, c).
        - Let (r_start, c_start) be the top-left interior coordinate.
        - Calculate relative checkerboard index: `idx = (r - r_start) + (c - c_start)`.
        - If `idx % 2 == 0`, set grid[r, c] to the rectangle's assigned Fill Color.
        - If `idx % 2 != 0`, set grid[r, c] to white (Color 0).

sequence:
  1. Identify the two Rectangles.
  2. Identify the two colors of Scattered Pixels outside the rectangles.
  3. Create a copy of the input grid.
  4. Remove the Scattered Pixels from the copied grid.
  5. Determine the swapped fill colors for the rectangles.
  6. Fill the interior of each rectangle with the appropriate checkerboard pattern using its assigned fill color.
