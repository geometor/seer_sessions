task_description: Tile patterns based on instructions from aligned markers.

grid_properties:
  - size: Variable height and width (up to 30x30).
  - background_color: white (0).

objects:
  - type: pattern
    description: Contiguous block of non-white (0), non-blue (1) pixels. Represents the content to be tiled.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0) or blue (1).
      - pixels: Set of coordinates forming the object.
      - bounding_box: Minimum rectangle enclosing the pattern (r_min, c_min, r_max, c_max).
      - height: r_max - r_min + 1
      - width: c_max - c_min + 1
  - type: marker
    description: Specifies tiling direction and lanes for a pattern. Always blue (1).
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape: Exactly 1x4 (horizontal) or 4x1 (vertical). Size is 4 pixels.
      - orientation: 'horizontal' or 'vertical'.
      - bounding_box: Minimum rectangle enclosing the marker.
      - alignment_axis: Columns for horizontal markers, Rows for vertical markers.
      - position_axis: Row for horizontal markers, Column for vertical markers.

actions:
  - name: identify_patterns
    input: input_grid
    output: list of pattern objects (color, pixels, bounding_box)
    description: Find all contiguous components of colors other than white(0) and blue(1). Calculate their bounding boxes.
  - name: identify_markers
    input: input_grid
    output: list of marker objects (color, pixels, bounding_box, orientation)
    description: Find all blue(1) components that are exactly 1x4 or 4x1. Determine orientation.
  - name: associate_markers_patterns
    input: patterns, markers
    output: patterns with associated directions (e.g., ['up', 'left'])
    description: >
      For each pattern, find markers that align with its bounding box.
      A horizontal marker aligns if its column range matches the pattern's bbox column range.
      A vertical marker aligns if its row range matches the pattern's bbox row range.
      The relative position (marker above/below pattern for horizontal; marker left/right of pattern for vertical) determines the direction ('up', 'down', 'left', 'right').
  - name: initialize_output
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Create a copy of the input grid.
  - name: remove_markers
    input: output_grid, markers
    output: modified output_grid
    description: Change the color of all marker pixels in the output grid to white (0).
  - name: extract_tile
    input: output_grid (after marker removal), pattern_bbox
    output: tile (numpy array)
    description: Extract the content within the pattern's bounding box from the modified output grid.
  - name: perform_tiling
    input: output_grid, pattern_bbox, tile, associated_directions
    output: modified output_grid
    description: >
      For each associated direction ('up', 'down', 'left', 'right'):
      Repeatedly copy the 'tile' into the output grid, starting from the edge of the pattern's bounding box and moving in the specified direction.
      Tiling occurs only along the rows (for left/right) or columns (for up/down) defined by the pattern's bounding box.
      Stop tiling at the grid boundaries. Overwrite existing pixels.

final_output: The modified output_grid after all patterns have been tiled according to their associated markers.
