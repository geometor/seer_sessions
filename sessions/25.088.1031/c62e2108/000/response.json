The markers act as directional cues associated with the patterns. The transformation involves tiling or repeating the patterns in the directions indicated by the markers associated with them. The tiling fills the space between the pattern's edge and the corresponding grid edge, but only along the rows or columns occupied by the pattern's bounding box. The blue markers are removed in the output.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
