Grid:
  background_color: 1 # blue
  objects_present: true

Objects:
  identity: Defined by contiguous pixels of non-background colors.
  colors_observed: [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8] # red, green, yellow, magenta, orange, azure
  properties:
    - position (row, col)
    - color

Transformation:
  type: Pixel-wise duplication
  direction: Horizontal, to the right
  condition: Applies only to non-background (non-blue) pixels.
  effect: Each non-blue pixel at (row, col) causes the pixel at (row, col+1) to adopt its color in the output grid.
  preservation: Original pixel locations and colors are maintained in the output unless overwritten by the duplication rule.
  boundary_handling: Duplication does not occur for pixels in the rightmost column (no wrapping).
  output_grid_init: Starts as a copy of the input grid.

Relationships:
  - A non-blue pixel influences the color of its immediate right neighbour.
