            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are relatively large (22x22 in train_1, 24x24 in train_2) and predominantly filled with the color blue (1), which acts as a background color.\n2.  **Objects:** Scattered within the blue background are small \"objects\" or patterns composed of other colors (yellow, magenta, azure, red, green in train_1; yellow, magenta, orange, azure, green in train_2). These objects vary in shape and size, from single pixels to small clusters or lines.\n3.  **Transformation:** Comparing the input and output grids reveals a consistent change: each non-blue pixel in the input seems to \"stamp\" or duplicate its color onto the pixel immediately to its right in the output grid.\n4.  **Preservation:** The original non-blue pixels from the input are preserved in their original locations in the output grid. The blue background pixels are also preserved unless they are immediately to the right of a non-blue pixel, in which case they are overwritten by the color of the pixel to their left.\n5.  **Boundaries:** The duplication effect does not wrap around the grid edges. If a non-blue pixel is in the rightmost column, it does not duplicate its color.\n6.  **Overwriting:** If a pixel at (row, col+1) is the target of a duplication from (row, col), its original color (whether blue or another color) is replaced by the color from (row, col). This is evident where parts of the original shapes get overwritten by the duplication from their left neighbour (e.g. the centre of the yellow 'U' in train_2 output). However, in the given examples, the primary effect is overwriting blue pixels or pixels that were already the same color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Examine every pixel in the input grid, one by one, using its row and column coordinates.\n3.  For each pixel located at (row, col):\n    a.  Check if its color is *not* blue (1).\n    b.  If the pixel's color is not blue:\n        i.  Calculate the column index of the pixel immediately to its right: `right_col = col + 1`.\n        ii. Check if `right_col` is a valid column index within the grid's boundaries (i.e., `right_col` is less than the grid's width).\n        iii. If `right_col` is within the grid bounds, update the pixel at coordinates (row, `right_col`) in the *output grid* to match the color of the current pixel at (row, col).\n4.  After checking all pixels in the input grid, the final state of the output grid represents the result of the transformation."
