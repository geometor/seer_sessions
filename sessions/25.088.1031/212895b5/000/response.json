            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure**: The input grids consist of a white (0) background, scattered gray (5) pixels (some single, some forming small groups), and usually one larger block of azure (8) pixels (typically 3x3).\n2.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grids retain the original gray (5) and azure (8) pixels in their exact positions. The white (0) background pixels are partially replaced by red (2) and yellow (4) pixels. Some white pixels remain unchanged.\n3.  **Transformation Focus**: The core transformation happens to the white (0) pixels based on their proximity to the gray (5) pixels.\n4.  **Red Pixel Placement (2)**: Red pixels appear in the output where there were white pixels in the input. Their placement seems strongly correlated with *diagonal* adjacency to gray (5) pixels. If a white pixel in the input has one or more gray pixels diagonally adjacent to it, it becomes red in the output.\n5.  **Yellow Pixel Placement (4)**: Yellow pixels also replace white pixels from the input. They appear to fill contiguous areas of white pixels that are *orthogonally adjacent* to the newly placed red (2) pixels. This filling process seems bounded by the original gray (5) and azure (8) pixels, the newly placed red (2) pixels, and the grid edges. It behaves like a flood fill originating from the \"white side\" of the red pixels.\n6.  **Static Elements**: Gray (5) and azure (8) pixels act as static obstacles or boundaries that are not modified and constrain the placement of new colors.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
