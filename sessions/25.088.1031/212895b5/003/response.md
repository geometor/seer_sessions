Transformation Rule:
1. Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Identify pixels in the input grid that are white (0) AND have at least one gray (5) pixel diagonally adjacent to them. Change these corresponding pixels in the output grid to red (2).
3. Identify pixels in the *output* grid that are white (0) AND are orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, right) to any red (2) pixel. These pixels are the seeds for the yellow flood fill.
4. Perform a flood fill starting from these seed pixels:
   - Change the seed pixel to yellow (4).
   - The fill propagates orthogonally to adjacent pixels that are currently white (0) in the output grid.
   - Any pixel reached by the fill is changed to yellow (4).
   - The fill stops at grid boundaries and any non-white pixel (including original gray/azure, newly placed red, and already filled yellow pixels).
