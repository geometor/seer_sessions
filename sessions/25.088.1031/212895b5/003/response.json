Identify pixels in the *output* grid that are white (0) AND are orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, right) to any red (2) pixel. These pixels are the seeds for the yellow flood fill.\n4. Perform a flood fill starting from these seed pixels:\n   - Change the seed pixel to yellow (4).\n   - The fill propagates orthogonally to adjacent pixels that are currently white (0) in the output grid.\n   - Any pixel reached by the fill is changed to yellow (4).\n   - The fill stops at grid boundaries and any non-white pixel (including original gray/azure, newly placed red, and already filled yellow pixels).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef is_within_bounds(r, c, height, width):\n    \"\"\"Check if coordinates (r, c) are within the grid dimensions.\"\"\"\n    return 0 <= r < height and 0 <= c < width\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: The transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n    \n    # Step 1: Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_np)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Identify and place red pixels ---\n    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check if the current cell in the *input* grid is white (0)\n            if input_np[r, c] == 0:\n                has_diagonal_gray = False\n                # Check its 4 diagonal neighbors in the *input* grid\n                for dr in [-1, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 1]:\n                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                        #"
