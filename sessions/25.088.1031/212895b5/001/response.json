Identify white (0) cells in the input grid that have at least one diagonally adjacent gray (5) cell. Change these cells to red (2) in the output grid.\n3. Identify all white (0) cells in the *output* grid that are orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, right) to any red (2) cell.\n4. Perform a flood fill starting from these adjacent white cells:\n   - Change the starting white cell to yellow (4).\n   - Add its orthogonal white (0) neighbors to a queue.\n   - Continue the process until the queue is empty. The fill propagates only through white (0) cells and is blocked by any other color (including the newly placed red and yellow cells, original gray and azure cells) and grid boundaries.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef is_within_bounds(r, c, height, width):\n    \"\"\"Check if coordinates (r, c) are within the grid dimensions.\"\"\"\n    return 0 <= r < height and 0 <= c < width\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_np)\n\n    # --- Step 1 & 2: Identify and place red pixels ---\n    red_pixels_coords = []\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check if the current cell is white (0)\n            if input_np[r, c] == 0:\n                # Check its 8 diagonal neighbors\n                has_diagonal_gray = False\n                for dr in [-1, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 1]:\n                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                        # Check bounds and color of the neighbor in the *input* grid\n                        if is_within_bounds(nr, nc, height, width) and input_np[nr, nc] == 5:\n                            has_diagonal_gray = True\n                            break\n                    if has_diagonal_gray:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a diagonal gray neighbor was found, change the cell to red in the output grid\n                if has_diagonal_gray:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 2\n                    red_pixels_coords.append((r,c)) # Keep track for next step if needed, though not strictly necessary\n\n    # --- Step 3 & 4: Flood fill yellow from white neighbors of red pixels ---\n    queue = deque()\n    \n    # Find initial white (0) cells orthogonally adjacent to red (2) cells in the *output* grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n             # Check only original white cells that are now red\n            if output_grid[r,c] == 2 : # Check red cells placed in the previous step\n                 # Check 4 orthogonal neighbors\n                for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                    # Check bounds and if the neighbor is *currently* white (0) in the output grid\n                    if is_within_bounds(nr, nc, height, width) and output_grid[nr, nc] == 0:\n                        # Add to queue and mark immediately to avoid duplicates/reprocessing\n                        # Important: Check if it's already yellow or queued implicitly by marking\n                        if output_grid[nr, nc] == 0: # Double check to ensure it wasn't just added by another red neighbor\n                           output_grid[nr, nc] = 4 # Mark as yellow immediately\n                           queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    # Perform the flood fill\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # The cell (r, c) is already marked yellow (4) when added to the queue.\n        # Now find its orthogonal white neighbors\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            \n            # Check bounds and if the neighbor is white (0) in the output grid\n            if is_within_bounds(nr, nc, height, width) and output_grid[nr, nc] == 0:\n                # Mark as yellow and add to queue\n                output_grid[nr, nc] = 4\n                queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    # Convert numpy array back to list of lists for the expected output format\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
