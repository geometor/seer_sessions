Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input and Output Grids:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions (20x20 in all examples).
2.  **Color Palette:** A wide range of colors (0-9) are used in the input. The output uses the same colors, but with a significant increase in the white color (0).
3.  **Key Transformation:** The core change involves replacing existing colors with white (0) pixels in specific rows and columns of the grid.
4.  **Trigger Identification:** Observing the input grids reveals a consistent pattern: the presence of a `2x2` square block composed entirely of white pixels (0).
    *   In `train_1`, this white square is at rows 6-7, columns 8-9.
    *   In `train_2`, this white square is at rows 11-12, columns 6-7.
    *   In `train_3`, this white square is at rows 4-5, columns 14-15.
5.  **Transformation Rule:** The rows and columns that form this `2x2` white square are the targets for modification.
    *   All pixels within these identified rows are changed to white (0) in the output grid, *unless* the original pixel color was red (2). Red pixels remain unchanged.
    *   Similarly, all pixels within these identified columns are changed to white (0) in the output grid, *unless* the original pixel color was red (2). Red pixels remain unchanged.
6.  **Protected Color:** The color red (2) seems to be immune to the transformation; red pixels are preserved in their original locations within the affected rows and columns. All other colors in these rows/columns are overwritten with white (0).
7.  **Overlap:** Pixels located at the intersection of a target row and a target column (including the original `2x2` white block itself) follow the same rule: they become white (0) unless they were originally red (2).

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions_preserved: true
  Objects:
    - type: Pixel
      properties:
        - color: integer (0-9)
    - type: Marker_Block
      definition: A 2x2 square of white (0) pixels.
      location: Found within the input grid. Assume exactly one exists per input.
      associated_elements:
        - Rows: The two rows spanned by the Marker_Block.
        - Columns: The two columns spanned by the Marker_Block.
Transformation:
  Action: Overwrite_Pixels
  Target:
    - Pixels within the rows associated with the Marker_Block.
    - Pixels within the columns associated with the Marker_Block.
  Condition: Apply Overwrite_Pixels if the original pixel color is NOT red (2).
  Result: The overwritten pixel's color becomes white (0).
  Exception: Pixels with the color red (2) are preserved (copied directly from input to output).
Default_Behavior: If no Marker_Block (2x2 white square) is found, the output grid is identical to the input grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Search the input grid for a `2x2` square block composed entirely of white (0) pixels.
3.  If no such `2x2` white block is found, return the unmodified output grid.
4.  If found, identify the two rows (R1, R2) and two columns (C1, C2) that contain this `2x2` white block.
5.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) in row R1 of the input grid: If the cell's color is not red (2), change the color of the corresponding cell in the output grid to white (0).
6.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) in row R2 of the input grid: If the cell's color is not red (2), change the color of the corresponding cell in the output grid to white (0).
7.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) in column C1 of the input grid: If the cell's color is not red (2), change the color of the corresponding cell in the output grid to white (0).
8.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) in column C2 of the input grid: If the cell's color is not red (2), change the color of the corresponding cell in the output grid to white (0).
9.  Return the modified output grid.
