            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input and Output Grids:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions (20x20 in all examples).\n2.  **Color Palette:** A wide range of colors (0-9) are used in the input. The output uses the same colors, but with a significant increase in the white color (0).\n3.  **Key Transformation:** The core change involves replacing existing colors with white (0) pixels in specific rows and columns of the grid.\n4.  **Trigger Identification:** Observing the input grids reveals a consistent pattern: the presence of a `2x2` square block composed entirely of white pixels (0).\n    *   In `train_1`, this white square is at rows 6-7, columns 8-9.\n    *   In `train_2`, this white square is at rows 11-12, columns 6-7.\n    *   In `train_3`, this white square is at rows 4-5, columns 14-15.\n5.  **Transformation Rule:** The rows and columns that form this `2x2` white square are the targets for modification.\n    *   All pixels within these identified rows are changed to white (0) in the output grid, *unless* the original pixel color was red (2). Red pixels remain unchanged.\n    *   Similarly, all pixels within these identified columns are changed to white (0) in the output grid, *unless* the original pixel color was red (2). Red pixels remain unchanged.\n6.  **Protected Color:** The color red (2) seems to be immune to the transformation; red pixels are preserved in their original locations within the affected rows and columns. All other colors in these rows/columns are overwritten with white (0).\n7.  **Overlap:** Pixels located at the intersection of a target row and a target column (including the original `2x2` white block itself) follow the same rule: they become white (0) unless they were originally red (2).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
