Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions_preserved: true
  Objects:
    - type: Pixel
      properties:
        - color: integer (0-9)
    - type: Marker_Block
      definition: A 2x2 square of white (0) pixels.
      location: Found within the input grid. Assume exactly one exists per input.
      associated_elements:
        - Rows: The two rows spanned by the Marker_Block.
        - Columns: The two columns spanned by the Marker_Block.
Transformation:
  Action: Overwrite_Pixels
  Target:
    - Pixels within the rows associated with the Marker_Block.
    - Pixels within the columns associated with the Marker_Block.
  Condition: Apply Overwrite_Pixels if the original pixel color is NOT red (2).
  Result: The overwritten pixel's color becomes white (0).
  Exception: Pixels with the color red (2) are preserved (copied directly from input to output).
Default_Behavior: If no Marker_Block (2x2 white square) is found, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
