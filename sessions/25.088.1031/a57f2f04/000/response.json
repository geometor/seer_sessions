            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain one or more distinct rectangular regions bounded by an azure (8) border. Inside these regions, there are areas of white (0) pixels and a small \"pattern kernel\" composed of non-white, non-azure pixels.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the azure borders. The areas inside the borders, which were mostly white in the input, are now filled with a repeating pattern.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the small pattern kernel within each bounded region in the input and then tiling this pattern across the entire corresponding region in the output.\n4.  **Pattern Kernel:** The kernel seems to be the smallest rectangular subgrid within the bounded area that contains all the non-white, non-azure pixels. This rectangular subgrid, including any white pixels within it, serves as the repeating unit.\n5.  **Tiling:** The tiling starts from the top-left corner of the bounded region (the first non-azure pixel encountered). The kernel pattern is repeated horizontally and vertically to fill the entire region. The modulo operator based on the kernel's dimensions determines which part of the kernel pattern applies to each cell in the output region.\n6.  **Multiple Regions:** Some examples (like train\\_2 and train\\_3) have multiple, separate bordered regions. The tiling process is applied independently to each region using its specific kernel.\n7.  **Color Preservation:** The colors used in the kernel (red, blue, green, yellow) are preserved and replicated in the output tiling. The azure border color is also preserved. White pixels within the original kernel's bounding box are also part of the repeating pattern.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
