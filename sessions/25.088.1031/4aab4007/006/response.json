            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to fill white (0) pixels within the inner area of the grid (excluding the outermost border) based on colors found along the same diagonal (`r+c = constant`). However, the code failed on all training examples, producing outputs that differ significantly from the expected outputs. The number of incorrect pixels suggests a fundamental misunderstanding or misimplementation of the rule for finding the fill color.\n\nThe key errors in the previous code seem to be:\n1.  **Search Area:** The `find_color_on_diagonal` function restricted its search for the source color to the *fillable area* (rows 1 to H-2, cols 1 to W-2). Analysis of the expected outputs suggests the search for the source color should encompass the *entire* grid.\n2.  **Search Order:** The function searched by iterating through columns first (`c_s` loop). Analysis indicates that iterating through rows first (`r_s` loop) yields the correct source color according to the expected outputs.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the `find_color_on_diagonal` function to search the entire grid and iterate through rows first when checking pixels along the target diagonal. The main transformation loop, which iterates through the fillable area (`r=1..H-2, c=1..W-2`) and only modifies white pixels, appears correct and should be retained.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Input Dim (HxW) | Output Dim (HxW) | Input Colors (excluding 0) | Output Colors (excluding 0) | Pixels Off (Previous Code) | Notes                                                                 |\n| :------ | :-------------- | :--------------- | :------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | 28x28           | 28x28            | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7        | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7         | 57                         | White pixels in the inner area are filled. Borders remain unchanged.  |\n| 2       | 28x28           | 28x28            | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7           | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7            | 46                         | White pixels in the inner area are filled. Borders remain unchanged.  |\n| 3       | 28x28           | 28x28            | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9   | 78                         | White pixels in the inner area are filled. Some white pixels exist outside the fillable area (e.g., row 7, col 1) and are not changed. |\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   The grid dimensions remain constant.\n*   The set of non-white colors present generally remains the same, but their counts change as white pixels are replaced.\n*   The transformation only affects pixels within the rows `1` to `H-2` and columns `1` to `W-2`. Pixels on the absolute border (row 0, row H-1, col 0, col W-1) are never modified.\n*   Only pixels that are initially white (0) within this inner area are candidates for modification. Non-white pixels in the inner area retain their original color.\n*   The fill color for a white pixel at `(r, c)` is determined by a color found on the same diagonal (`row + col = r + c`) in the *input* grid.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
