Context:
  - Grid dimensions: Height (H) and Width (W) between 1x1 and 30x30.
  - Pixels: Represented by integers 0-9 (colors). 0 is white.
  - Transformation Area: The transformation targets the inner part of the grid, specifically pixels (r, c) where 1 <= r <= H-2 and 1 <= c <= W-2.
  - Border: The outermost border (row 0, row H-1, col 0, col W-1) is never modified.

Objects:
  - Input Grid: The initial state.
  - Output Grid: The transformed state.
  - Border Pixels: Pixels at row 0, row H-1, col 0, or col W-1. Remain unchanged.
  - Inner Pixels: Pixels at (r, c) where 1 <= r <= H-2 and 1 <= c <= W-2.
    - Inner White Pixels: Inner pixels with value 0. These are modified.
    - Inner Non-White Pixels: Inner pixels with values 1-9. Remain unchanged.
  - Diagonals: Sets of pixels (r, c) where r + c is constant.

Actions:
  - Identify Target Pixels: Select pixels (r, c) within the Inner Pixels area that are white (0) in the Input Grid.
  - Determine Fill Color: For each Target Pixel at (r, c):
    - Identify the target diagonal constant k = r + c.
    - Search the *entire* Input Grid for pixels (r_s, c_s) such that r_s + c_s = k.
    - Iterate through potential source pixels by increasing row index `r_s` (from 0 to H-1).
    - Calculate the corresponding column index `c_s = k - r_s`.
    - Check if `c_s` is within the grid bounds (0 <= c_s <= W-1).
    - The Fill Color is the value of the *first* pixel (r_s, c_s) encountered during this row-first search that is *not* white (value > 0).
  - Update Output Grid: For each Target Pixel, change its value from 0 to the determined Fill Color in the Output Grid. Copy all other pixels (Border Pixels and Inner Non-White Pixels) directly from the Input Grid to the Output Grid.
