## General Assessment

The provided code successfully solved the first training example but failed on the second and third. The core logic of identifying a central pattern area, borders, and filling white pixels based on a diagonal pattern seems partially correct.

The failures in examples 2 and 3 indicate that the definition of the area where white pixels should be filled was too restrictive. The code only filled white pixels within the "core pattern area" (rows 3 to H-2, cols 3 to W-2), but the expected outputs show that white pixels *outside* this area (specifically in the regions corresponding to the yellow border and the inner blue border of the input) should also be filled using the same diagonal rule.

Additionally, the method `find_first_pattern_pixel_on_diagonal` iterates through potential *rows* (`r_s`) first to find the pattern color. Analysis suggests that iterating through potential *columns* (`c_s`) first within the core area yields the correct pattern color for the failed examples.

The strategy will be to:
1.  Modify the iteration loop to consider *all* pixels for filling, *except* for the absolute outermost border (row 0, H-1, col 0, W-1).
2.  Modify the diagonal search function (`find_first_pattern_pixel_on_diagonal`) to iterate through columns (`c_s`) within the core pattern search area (rows 3 to H-2, cols 3 to W-2) to find the first non-white color along the diagonal.
3.  Ensure the original border pixels (blue and yellow) are overwritten if they are white (0) in the input, using the diagonal fill rule. Non-white border pixels (outside the absolute outer border) should remain unchanged if they are not white.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:** Passed correctly (Score: 0). No errors.
*   **Example 2:** Failed (Score: 6.12). `pixels_off`: 12 in the original run, 2 in the simplified test case here. The `error_coords` and `errors_outside_core` confirm the mismatches occurred at `(1, 11)` through `(1, 16)` and `(2, 11)` through `(2, 16)` in the original large grid (corresponding to `(1,3)` and `(1,4)` in the simplified example). These coordinates are indeed outside the defined core area (`rows >= 3`, `cols >= 3`). The `unfilled_white_coords` match these error locations, confirming white pixels outside the core were not filled as required.
*   **Example 3:** Failed (Score: 5.10). `pixels_off`: 10 in the original run, 3 in the simplified test case. `error_coords` include `(7, 1)`, `(7, 2)`, `(8, 1)`, `(8, 2)`, etc. (corresponding to `(1,1)`, `(4,1)`, `(4,3)` in the simplified example). `errors_outside_core` confirms many errors were outside the strict core definition. `unfilled_white_coords` again match the errors, showing white pixels in rows/columns 1 and 2 were incorrectly left as white.

The metrics confirm the hypothesis: the transformation needs to apply to white pixels potentially *outside* the initially defined core (rows 3..H-2, cols 3..W-2), but the *source color* for the fill must still come from a non-white pixel *within* that core area, found by searching along the diagonal by *column* first. The absolute outer border (row 0, H-1, col 0, W-1) remains unchanged.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    - Grids contain pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
    - white: 0, blue: 1, red: 2, green: 3, yellow: 4, gray: 5, magenta: 6, orange: 7, azure: 8, maroon: 9.
  structure:
    - Grids have distinct border regions and a central pattern area.
    - outer_border: Rows 0 and H-1, Columns 0 and W-1 are typically blue (1). These pixels remain unchanged in the output.
    - inner_border: Row 2 and Column 2 are typically yellow (4) in the input. Row H-2 and Column W-2 are also border-like. These may change in the output *if* they contain white pixels.
    - core_pattern_area (for color lookup): Defined by rows 3 to H-2 and columns 3 to W-2 in the input grid. This area contains the definitive diagonal color patterns.
    - target_pixels (for filling): All white (0) pixels in the input grid, *except* those on the absolute outer border (row 0, H-1, col 0, W-1).
transformation:
  action: Fill white pixels.
  rule: Diagonal color propagation.
  details:
    - Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid, excluding the outer_border.
    - If the pixel input[r, c] is white (0):
        - Calculate the diagonal constant k = r + c.
        - Find the fill_color:
            - Search within the core_pattern_area of the *input* grid.
            - Iterate through column indices c_s from 3 to W-2.
            - Calculate the corresponding row index r_s = k - c_s.
            - Check if r_s is within the core_pattern_area row bounds (3 to H-2).
            - If input[r_s, c_s] is not white (0), this is the fill_color. Stop searching for this diagonal.
        - Set the output pixel output[r, c] to the found fill_color.
    - If the pixel input[r, c] is not white (0) and not on the outer_border:
        - Copy the color directly: output[r, c] = input[r, c].
    - Pixels on the outer_border are copied directly: output[r, c] = input[r, c].
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Define the boundaries of the core pattern area used for color searching: `search_min_row = 3`, `search_max_row = H - 2`, `search_min_col = 3`, `search_max_col = W - 2`, where H and W are the height and width of the grid.
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the grid using its row `r` (from 1 to H-2) and column `c` (from 1 to W-2). Skip the absolute outer border (rows 0, H-1 and columns 0, W-1) as these remain unchanged.
4.  For the current pixel `(r, c)`, check if its value in the input grid is white (0).
5.  If the pixel `input[r, c]` is white:
    a.  Calculate the diagonal identifier `k = r + c`.
    b.  Determine the fill color: Iterate through potential source columns `c_s` from `search_min_col` to `search_max_col`.
    c.  Calculate the corresponding source row `r_s = k - c_s`.
    d.  Check if the source coordinate `(r_s, c_s)` falls within the core pattern area bounds (`search_min_row <= r_s <= search_max_row`).
    e.  If it is within bounds, check the color `color = input[r_s, c_s]`.
    f.  If `color` is not white (0), then this `color` is the required fill color for the diagonal `k`. Store this color and break the search for the current `(r, c)`.
    g.  Update the output grid at the current position: `output[r, c] = fill_color`.
6.  If the pixel `input[r, c]` is *not* white (and not on the outer border), its value remains unchanged in the output grid (already copied in step 1).
7.  Return the completed output grid.
