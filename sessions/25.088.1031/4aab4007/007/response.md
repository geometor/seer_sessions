"""
Transforms the input grid by filling in white (0) pixels within the inner area
(excluding the absolute outermost border: row 0, H-1, col 0, W-1).
The color used to fill a white pixel at (r, c) in the inner area is determined
by finding the first non-white pixel encountered along the same diagonal 
(where row + col is constant) in the *input* grid. The search along the 
diagonal proceeds by iterating through rows first (from 0 to H-1). 
Non-white pixels within the inner area, and all pixels on the border, 
retain their original color.
