            "text": "**Perception of the Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are grids composed of pixels with values 0-9 representing different colors. The grids contain distinct regions and objects. Notably, there's often a large background area (like azure-8 or white-0) and smaller embedded shapes or patterns.\n2.  **Object Identification:** Key objects appear to be:\n    *   Simple, single-color shapes (e.g., small green, gray, yellow shapes).\n    *   \"Framed\" objects: A region of one color (consistently blue-1 in the transformations that follow a clear pattern) completely enclosed by a frame of a different, single color (often red-2).\n    *   Background areas (white-0, azure-8).\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The primary transformation occurs within the framed objects. Specifically, the *interior* color (blue-1) changes, while the frame color remains the same. Other simple shapes and background areas generally remain unchanged.\n4.  **Color Change Mechanism:** The new color assigned to the blue-1 interior seems to be copied from one of the simple, single-colored shapes present elsewhere in the grid (\"source objects\"). There appears to be a pairing mechanism linking each framed object (\"target object\") to a source object.\n5.  **Anomaly:** In `train_2`, there's an exception: a solid green-3 rectangle transforms into a solid blue-1 rectangle. This doesn't fit the \"blue interior changing color based on a source object\" pattern observed in all other transformations across the examples. It might require a special condition or indicate a more complex underlying rule.\n6.  **Pairing:** The exact method for pairing target objects (blue interiors) with source objects (simple shapes) isn't immediately obvious from visual inspection or simple proximity; it might involve relative positioning, ordering, or other properties.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
