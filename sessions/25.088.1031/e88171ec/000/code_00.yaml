task_description: Identify the largest rectangular area composed entirely of white pixels in the input grid and fill that area with azure pixels in the output grid.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
input_elements:
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: background / potential area for transformation
  - type: pixel
    color: various (non-white)
    role: foreground / boundary definition
output_elements:
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    source: copied from input
  - type: pixel
    color: various (non-white)
    source: copied from input
  - type: object
    shape: rectangle
    color: azure (8)
    location: position of the largest all-white rectangle found in the input
    size: dimensions of the largest all-white rectangle found in the input
transformation:
  - action: find_largest_rectangle
    criteria:
      - all pixels within the rectangle must be white (0)
      - maximize area (height * width)
    target: input_grid
    tie_breaking: (Implicit) Assume unique largest or use top-leftmost if needed.
  - action: fill_rectangle
    target_area: the identified largest all-white rectangle
    fill_color: azure (8)
    destination: output_grid
  - action: copy_pixels
    source: input_grid
    destination: output_grid
    condition: pixels not part of the identified largest all-white rectangle
