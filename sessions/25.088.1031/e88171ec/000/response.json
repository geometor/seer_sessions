The primary background color is white (0).\n2.  **Color Palette:** The input grids use white (0) and one dominant color (yellow-4, red-2, or green-3), sometimes with scattered gray (5) pixels. The output grids are identical to the inputs except for the addition of azure (8) pixels.\n3.  **Key Change:** A rectangular block of azure (8) pixels appears in the output grid. This block did not exist in the input.\n4.  **Location of Change:** The azure rectangle appears in an area that was entirely white (0) in the input grid.\n5.  **Identifying the Area:** Comparing the input and output grids across the examples, the azure rectangle consistently fills the largest contiguous rectangular area composed solely of white (0) pixels in the input grid.\n    *   Example 1: A 3x4 white rectangle at (row 5, col 5) becomes azure.\n    *   Example 2: A 2x2 white rectangle at (row 4, col 6) becomes azure.\n    *   Example 3: A 2x4 white rectangle at (row 11, col 8) becomes azure.\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation seems to be identifying the largest \"empty\" (all white) rectangle within the input grid and then \"filling\" that specific rectangle with the color azure (8) in the output, leaving all other pixels unchanged. \"Largest\" refers to the area (height * width) of the rectangle.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
