Transformation Rule:
1. Find the unique 3x3 block in the input grid that contains the color yellow (4). This is the 'source pattern'.
2. Find all other 3x3 blocks in the input grid.
3. For each of these other 3x3 blocks, calculate its similarity to the source pattern. Similarity is defined as the number of cells that have the same color in the same position within the 3x3 block.
4. Identify the maximum similarity score found among all non-source 3x3 blocks.
5. Find all 3x3 blocks (excluding the source pattern block) that achieve this maximum similarity score. These are the 'destination blocks'.
6. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
7. For each location where a destination block was found, overwrite the 3x3 region at that location in the output grid with the source pattern.
