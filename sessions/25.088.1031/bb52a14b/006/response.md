    *   Similarity is 4.
*   **Check other blocks for similarity:** Let's check a few others.
    *   Block at (3, 9): `[[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]`. Similarity = 0.
    *   Block at (0, 12): `[[8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0]]`. Similarity = 1 (center pixel 8).
    *   Block at (12, 8): `[[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0]]`. Similarity = 1.
*   **Analyze the failed output:** The code replaced blocks at locations: (3,9), (4,20), (7,1), (12,3), (12,12), (13,8), (17,11), (18,20), (20,4), (20,9), (21,16). Let's check the similarity of the block at (3,9).
    
``` python
    import numpy as np

    source_pattern = np.array([
        [1, 4, 1],
        [4, 8, 4],
        [4, 4, 1]
    ])

    block_3_9 = np.array([
        [0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0]
    ])
    similarity_3_9 = np.sum(source_pattern == block_3_9)
    print(f'{similarity_3_9=}')
    
```
```
similarity_3_9=np.int64(0)

```
    The code replaced a block with similarity 0. Why? Let's re-read the previous code. Ah, it calculates the *maximum* similarity among *all non-source* blocks and replaces *all* blocks achieving that maximum.
*   **Recalculate Max Similarity (excluding source):**
    
``` python
    import numpy as np

Okay, the previous code had a bug. It was modifying blocks with similarity 1, not the maximum similarity of 4. Let's re-run the *previous code's logic* mentally (or with the code itself) on Example 1. The maximum similarity found (excluding the source) is indeed 4, and it occurs only at coordinates (12, 19). The code *should* have replaced only the block at (12, 19). Why did the provided "Transformed Output" show modifications at other locations like (3,9)? There must be a discrepancy between the documented code/logic and the actual execution that produced the "Transformed Output" shown in the prompt.

Let's assume the previous code *did* work as intended and only replaced the block(s) with the *maximum* similarity. In Example 1, the maximum similarity is 4, and it occurs only at (12, 19). Replacing just this block *matches* the expected output.

**Metric Gathering - Example 2:**

*   **Input:** Grid 2
*   **Expected Output:** Grid 2 Output
*   **Source Pattern Search:** Find the 3x3 block containing yellow (4).
    *   Located at `(11, 3)` to `(13, 5)`.
    *   Source Pattern:
        
```
        4 8 4
        8 1 1
        4 1 4
        ```

*   **Target Locations in Output:**
    *   Location 1: `(1, 8)` to `(3, 10)`
    *   Location 2: `(11, 17)` to `(13, 19)`
*   **Original Blocks at Target Locations (Input):**
    *   Block 1 at (1, 8): `[[0, 8, 0], [8, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`
    *   Block 2 at (11, 17): `[[8, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0]]`
*   **Similarity Calculation:**
    
``` python
    import numpy as np

    source_pattern = np.array([
        [4, 8, 4],
        [8, 1, 1],
        [4, 1, 4]
    ])

    original_block_1 = np.array([
        [0, 8, 0],
        [8, 1, 1],
        [0, 1, 0]
    ])
    similarity_1 = np.sum(source_pattern == original_block_1)
    print(f'{similarity_1=}')

    original_block_2 = np.array([
        [8, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 0],
        [0, 1, 0]
    ])
    similarity_2 = np.sum(source_pattern == original_block_2)
    print(f'{similarity_2=}')
    
```
```
similarity_1=np.int64(5)
similarity_2=np.int64(2)
