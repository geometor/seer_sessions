Let's re-run the *previous code's logic* mentally (or with the code itself) on Example 1. The maximum similarity found (excluding the source) is indeed 4, and it occurs only at coordinates (12, 19). The code *should* have replaced only the block at (12, 19). Why did the provided \"Transformed Output\" show modifications at other locations like (3,9)? There must be a discrepancy between the documented code/logic and the actual execution that produced the \"Transformed Output\" shown in the prompt.\n\nLet's assume the previous code *did* work as intended and only replaced the block(s) with the *maximum* similarity.
