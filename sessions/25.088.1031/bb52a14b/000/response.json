Yellow (4) appears distinctively within specific 3x3 patterns.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying a specific 3x3 pattern (the \"source\") in the input and copying it to a different location (the \"destination\") in the output grid. The original pixels at the destination are overwritten.\n4.  **Source Pattern Identification:** In each example, there is exactly one 3x3 block that contains the color yellow (4). This unique block serves as the source pattern to be copied. The specific arrangement of colors within this source pattern varies between examples.\n5.  **Destination Pattern Identification:** The destination location is identified by finding a 3x3 block that matches one of two specific predefined patterns.\n    *   Pattern A: `[[1, 0, 1], [0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 1]]` (Seen in `train_1` and `train_2`)\n    *   Pattern B: `[[8, 0, 0], [8, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]` (Seen in `train_3`)\n    It appears that in any given input grid, exactly one instance of either Pattern A or Pattern B will exist, marking the destination.\n6.  **Consistency:** Apart from the copy-paste operation, the rest of the grid remains unchanged between input and output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
