Transformation Rule:
1. Find the unique 3x3 block in the input grid that contains the color yellow (4). This is the 'source pattern', and note its top-left coordinate.
2. Initialize an empty list to store the coordinates of 'destination blocks' and a variable to track the maximum similarity found so far (initialized to -1).
3. Iterate through all possible top-left coordinates (r, c) for a 3x3 block in the input grid.
4. For each potential block at (r, c):
    a. Check if (r, c) is the coordinate of the source pattern block. If it is, skip this block.
    b. Extract the 3x3 block starting at (r, c).
    c. Calculate the similarity between this block and the source pattern. Similarity is defined as the number of cells that have the same color in the same position within the 3x3 block.
    d. Compare the calculated similarity with the current maximum similarity:
        i. If the current similarity is greater than the maximum similarity, update the maximum similarity to this value and reset the list of destination coordinates to contain only the current (r, c).
        ii. If the current similarity is equal to the maximum similarity, add the current (r, c) to the list of destination coordinates.
5. Create the output grid by making a copy of the input grid.
6. Iterate through the list of destination coordinates identified in step 4.
7. For each destination coordinate (dest_r, dest_c), overwrite the 3x3 region starting at (dest_r, dest_c) in the output grid with the source pattern found in step 1.
8. Return the modified output grid.
