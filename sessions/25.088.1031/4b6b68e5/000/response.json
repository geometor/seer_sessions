These shapes act as boundaries.\n    *   Some of these shapes fully enclose regions of white pixels (color 0).\n    *   Within these enclosed white regions, there can be other non-white, non-boundary pixels (\"marker pixels\"). Examples include gray (5), azure (8), green (3), red (2), magenta (6).\n    *   The task involves identifying these enclosed regions and filling the white pixels within them.\n    *   The color used for filling is determined by the marker pixels present inside the specific enclosed region.\n    *   Shapes or regions that are not fully enclosed remain unchanged.\n    *   The boundary pixels of the shapes themselves remain unchanged in the output.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
