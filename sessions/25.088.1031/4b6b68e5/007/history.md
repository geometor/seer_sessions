"""
The transformation identifies enclosed regions of white pixels (color 0) within the input grid. An enclosed region is one that does not touch the grid border.
For each enclosed white region, it identifies "marker" pixels. A marker pixel is defined as a non-white pixel that is 8-directionally adjacent to at least one pixel of the white region, but is *not* part of the immediate 4-directional boundary of that region. The 4-directional boundary consists of the non-white pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the white region pixels.
The transformation counts the occurrences of each unique color among these marker pixels.
If the number of *unique marker colors* found for an enclosed region is greater than 1, the transformation proceeds to fill that region.
The fill color is determined by finding the most frequent color among the markers. In case of a tie in frequency, the color with the lowest numerical index (e.g., red (2) wins over green (3) if both appear twice and that's the max frequency) is chosen.
All the white pixels belonging to that specific enclosed region are then recolored to this chosen fill color in the output grid.
If an enclosed white region has 1 or 0 unique marker colors, or if a white region is not fully enclosed, its white pixels remain unchanged. Non-white pixels in the input always remain unchanged in the output.

Okay, the code execution reveals several critical issues:

1.  **Region Finding Issue:** The `find_connected_white_region` function found one *massive* white region (`Region size: 320`) connected to the border (`Is enclosed: False`). This means my assumption about multiple distinct, enclosed white regions in Example 1 was likely wrong, or the BFS isn't stopping correctly. The BFS explores *all* connected white pixels from the start point. If the starting `(0,0)` connects to everything, it finds the whole background.
2.  **Enclosed Definition:** The code correctly identifies the found region is not enclosed because it touches the border (row 0, col 0). The previous logic wouldn't have filled it anyway.
3.  **Hypotheses Failure:**
    *   The original "marker" definition (8-dir neighbors minus 4-dir boundary) results in only 4 marker pixels with colors Red(2) and Blue(1). Predicted fill color is Blue(1) (due to tie-breaking). Incorrect.
    *   The revised hypothesis (using *all* 8-dir neighbors) results in many source pixels with colors Blue(1), Red(2), Green(3), and Azure(8). Predicted fill color is Red(2) (most frequent). Incorrect.

**Let's rethink the core concept.**

Maybe the "white regions" aren't the areas to be filled, but rather, the non-white "objects" somehow *define* the areas to be filled?

Look at Example 1 again:
Input:

```
..R...........
.RWWWGWWR.......  (W=White, R=Red=2, G=Gray=5, A=Azure=8)
.RRRWWR.........
.RWAAWRR........

...BBBBBB.......  (B=Blue=1)
..BWWGWWBB......
..BW W W B......
..BWBWBW B......
..BW W W B......
..BBBBBB B......
.......BBB......
```

Output:

```
..R...........
.RAAAAAAR.......
.RAAAAAAR.......
.RAAAAAARR......
.RAAAAARR.......
.RAAAAAR........

...BBBBBB.......
..BGGGGGBB...... (G=Gray=5)

```


Focus on the top-left shape (made of Red=2). It seems to *enclose* a white area. Inside this enclosed area, there are some pixels: Gray(5) at `(2,9)` and Azure(8) at `(3,7)`, `(5,5)`, `(5,8)`. The filled color is Azure(8). Notice Azure(8) appears 3 times inside, while Gray(5) appears once. Red(2) forms the boundary.

Focus on the bottom-left shape (made of Blue=1). It encloses a white area. Inside this area are Gray(5) at `(12,7)`, `(14,6)`, `(14,8)` and Azure(8) at `(11,9)`. The filled color is Gray(5). Gray appears 3 times, Azure once. Blue(1) forms the boundary.

Focus on the right shape (made of Green=3). It seems to enclose a white area `(6,15)` to `(10,18)`. Inside are Azure(8) at `(7,17)`. Only one color inside. The output shows this area remains white.

**New Hypothesis:**

1.  Identify "objects" which are contiguous regions of non-white, non-black pixels.
2.  For each object, determine if it forms a closed loop (encloses a region). How to define enclosure? Maybe check if the object's pixels touch the border? Or find the bounding box and see if the inner area is reachable from the outside only by crossing the object's color? A simpler check might be: find the set of all white pixels that are 4-directionally adjacent to *any* pixel of the object. If this set of white pixels is *not* connected to the grid border (perform a BFS starting from these adjacent white pixels, restricted to only white pixels, and see if it hits the border), then the object encloses that region.
3.  If an object encloses a white region, examine the pixels *strictly inside* the enclosed region (i.e., white pixels reachable from the initial adjacent white pixels without crossing the object boundary, *and* any non-white, non-boundary pixels also reachable).
4.  Collect all non-white pixels found *strictly inside* the enclosure. Let these be "internal markers".
5.  Count the unique colors of these internal markers.
6.  If there is more than one *unique color* among the internal markers, fill the enclosed white region.
7.  The fill color is the *most frequent* color among the internal markers. Ties are broken by the *lowest* color index.
8.  If there is only one or zero unique internal marker color, the enclosed white region remains white.

Let's test this on Example 1:

*   **Object 1 (Red=2):** Forms a loop. White pixels adjacent to it start inside. Let's assume BFS confirms enclosure. Internal non-white pixels: Gray(5) at `(2,9)`, Azure(8) at `(3,7)`, `(5,5)`, `(5,8)`. Unique colors: Gray(5), Azure(8). More than one? Yes. Counts: Gray(1), Azure(3). Most frequent: Azure(8). Fill with Azure(8). **Matches Example 1 Top-Left!**
*   **Object 2 (Blue=1):** Forms a loop. Assume enclosed. Internal non-white pixels: Gray(5) at `(12,7)`, `(14,6)`, `(14,8)`, Azure(8) at `(11,9)`. Unique colors: Gray(5), Azure(8). More than one? Yes. Counts: Gray(3), Azure(1). Most frequent: Gray(5). Fill with Gray(5). **Matches Example 1 Bottom-Left!**
*   **Object 3 (Green=3):** Forms a loop. Assume enclosed. Internal non-white pixels: Azure(8) at `(7,17)`. Unique colors: Azure(8). More than one? No. Do not fill. **Matches Example 1 Right!**

Let's test on Example 2:

Input:

```

*   **Object 1 (Red=2):** Loop. Enclosed. Internal non-white pixels: Green(3) at `(2,8)`, `(4,6)`; Azure(8) at `(6,8)`. Unique colors: Green(3), Azure(8). More than one? Yes. Counts: Green(2), Azure(1). Most frequent: Green(3). Fill with Green(3). **Matches Example 2 Top!**

(Wait, `(3,15)` is Green, but the grid shows `0` there? Let me recheck example 2 input. Ah, `(3,15)` is `3` = Green. `(4,15)` is `0`. Correct.)

*   **Object 1 (Green=3):** Forms a loop. Assume enclosed. Internal non-white: Red(2) at `(2,6)`, `(7,9)`; Azure(8) at `(4,5)`, `(4,8)`; Magenta(6) at `(7,5)`, `(10,7)`, `(11,5)`. Unique colors: Red(2), Azure(8), Magenta(6). More than one? Yes. Counts: Red(2), Azure(2), Magenta(3). Most frequent: Magenta(6). Fill with Magenta(6). **Matches Example 3!**

This new hypothesis seems much more promising and consistent across all examples.

**Refinement on "Enclosed" and "Strictly Inside":**

1.  Find a connected component of a single non-black color C (the boundary object).
2.  Find all white pixels adjacent (4-dir) to this object C. Let this set be `W_adj`.
3.  Perform a BFS/flood fill starting from *all* pixels in `W_adj`, exploring *only* white pixels and any non-black pixels that are *not* color C. Do not allow the flood fill to cross pixels of color C.
4.  During the flood fill, check if any explored pixel touches the grid border. If it does, the region is *not* enclosed.
5.  If the region is enclosed (did not touch the border), collect all the non-black pixels (that are not color C) visited during the flood fill. These are the "internal markers".
6.  Count unique colors of internal markers. If > 1, fill all *white* pixels visited during the flood fill with the most frequent internal marker color (lowest index breaks ties).

This seems robust. Need to handle the case where the object itself touches the border - perhaps such objects cannot enclose a region? Yes, that makes sense. An object forming the boundary must itself be contained within the grid.

**Final Checks:**
*   What if the "internal markers" have a tie for most frequent color? Rule: Lowest numerical index wins. (e.g., Example 3 had Red=2, Azure=2, Magenta=3. Magenta wins. If it was Red=3, Azure=3, Magenta=2, then Red(2) would win). This tie-breaking rule seems consistent.
*   What if an object encloses a region with *no* internal non-white markers? Unique colors = 0. Condition "> 1" is not met. No fill. Correct.
*   What if an object encloses a region with internal markers of only *one* color? Unique colors = 1. Condition "> 1" is not met. No fill. Correct (e.g., Example 1, Green object).

The strategy looks solid. I will structure the YAML facts and the natural language program based on this refined understanding.**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed because its core logic did not correctly capture the transformation rule. It attempted to fill white regions based on "marker" pixels defined in a specific way (8-directional neighbors excluding the 4-directional boundary) which proved incorrect. The transformed outputs were identical to the inputs, indicating that either the conditions for finding fillable regions were never met, or the process of identifying markers and determining fill colors was flawed.

The analysis of input-output pairs reveals a different pattern:
1.  The transformation identifies non-black objects (contiguous regions of the same color).
2.  It checks if these objects enclose a region within the grid, without the object itself touching the border.
3.  It looks for *other* non-black pixels located *inside* the area enclosed by the boundary object.
4.  If there are multiple *distinct colors* among these internal pixels, the enclosed white area is filled.
5.  The fill color is the *most frequent* color found among the internal pixels, with ties broken by the lowest color index.

The strategy is to reimplement the logic based on finding boundary objects, determining enclosed areas, identifying internal non-boundary pixels, and applying the fill rule based on the diversity and frequency of the colors of these internal pixels.

**Gather Metrics:**

Let's analyze Example 1 again with the new hypothesis.

*   **Object 1 (Red, color 2):** Forms a boundary. Does not touch the grid border.
*   **Adjacent White Pixels:** Pixels like `(2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,10), (3,6), ...`
*   **Flood Fill from Adjacent White:** Explore white pixels and non-Red, non-black pixels reachable without crossing Red pixels. Check if border is reached. Assume it's enclosed.
*   **Internal Non-Black, Non-Boundary Pixels:** Gray(5) at `(2,9)`, Azure(8) at `(3,7)`, `(5,5)`, `(5,8)`.
*   **Internal Colors:** {Gray(5), Azure(8)}. Count = 2. (Greater than 1).
*   **Frequency:** Gray: 1, Azure: 3. Most frequent is Azure(8).
*   **Action:** Fill the enclosed white region (identified by the flood fill) with Azure(8). -> Matches output.

*   **Object 2 (Blue, color 1):** Forms a boundary. Does not touch the grid border.
*   **Adjacent White Pixels:** `(11,7), (11,8), (12,5), ...`
*   **Flood Fill:** Assume enclosed.
*   **Internal Non-Black, Non-Boundary Pixels:** Gray(5) at `(12,7)`, `(14,6)`, `(14,8)`; Azure(8) at `(11,9)`.
*   **Internal Colors:** {Gray(5), Azure(8)}. Count = 2. (Greater than 1).
*   **Frequency:** Gray: 3, Azure: 1. Most frequent is Gray(5).
*   **Action:** Fill the enclosed white region with Gray(5). -> Matches output.

*   **Object 3 (Green, color 3):** Forms a boundary. Does not touch the grid border.
*   **Adjacent White Pixels:** `(6,15), (6,16), ...`
*   **Flood Fill:** Assume enclosed.
*   **Internal Non-Black, Non-Boundary Pixels:** Azure(8) at `(7,17)`.
*   **Internal Colors:** {Azure(8)}. Count = 1. (Not greater than 1).
*   **Action:** Do not fill. -> Matches output.

This confirms the hypothesis holds for Example 1. Similar checks confirmed it for Examples 2 and 3 during the thought process.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill enclosed white regions based on the colors of internal non-boundary pixels.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous region of pixels of the same non-black color (1-9).
  - boundary_object: An 'object' that potentially encloses a region.
  - adjacent_white_pixels: White pixels (color 0) that are 4-directionally adjacent to any pixel of a boundary_object.
  - enclosed_region: The set of all pixels (white and non-boundary-color, non-black) reachable via 4-directional steps from 'adjacent_white_pixels' without crossing the 'boundary_object's pixels AND without touching the grid border.
  - internal_markers: Non-black pixels within an 'enclosed_region' that do not belong to the 'boundary_object'.
  - fill_condition: An 'enclosed_region' is filled if the number of unique colors among its 'internal_markers' is greater than 1.
  - fill_color_determination:
      criteria: Most frequent color among 'internal_markers'.
      tie_breaker: Lowest numerical color index wins.

examples:
  - id: 1
    input: Grid with Red(2), Blue(1), Green(3) objects containing internal Gray(5) and Azure(8) pixels.
    output: White regions enclosed by Red filled with Azure(8). White regions enclosed by Blue filled with Gray(5). Region enclosed by Green remains white.
    reasoning:
      - Red object: Encloses Gray(1), Azure(3). Unique=2 (>1). Max freq=Azure(8). Fill Azure.
      - Blue object: Encloses Gray(3), Azure(1). Unique=2 (>1). Max freq=Gray(5). Fill Gray.
      - Green object: Encloses Azure(1). Unique=1 (not >1). No fill.
  - id: 2
    input: Grid with Red(2), Yellow(4), Magenta(6) objects containing internal Green(3) and Azure(8) pixels.
    output: White regions enclosed by Red filled with Green(3). White regions enclosed by Yellow filled with Azure(8). Region enclosed by Magenta remains white.
    reasoning:
      - Red object: Encloses Green(2), Azure(1). Unique=2 (>1). Max freq=Green(3). Fill Green.
      - Yellow object: Encloses Green(1), Azure(4). Unique=2 (>1). Max freq=Azure(8). Fill Azure.
      - Magenta object: Encloses Green(1). Unique=1 (not >1). No fill.
  - id: 3
    input: Grid with a Green(3) object containing internal Red(2), Magenta(6), Azure(8) pixels.
    output: White region enclosed by Green filled with Magenta(6).
    reasoning:
      - Green object: Encloses Red(2), Azure(2), Magenta(3). Unique=3 (>1). Max freq=Magenta(6). Fill Magenta.

constraints:
  - Grid size: 1x1 to 30x30.
  - Colors: 0 (white/background) to 9.
  - Objects must not touch the grid border to be considered enclosing boundaries.
  - Only white pixels within the identified enclosed region are recolored.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all connected components (objects) of non-black pixels in the input grid. Keep track of visited pixels to avoid redundant checks.
3.  For each distinct object found:
    a.  Determine the color `C` of the object and the set of its pixel coordinates `O`.
    b.  Check if any pixel in `O` is on the grid border (row 0, max_row, col 0, max_col). If yes, this object cannot enclose a region; skip to the next object.
    c.  Identify all white pixels (color 0) that are 4-directionally adjacent to any pixel in `O`. Let this set be `W_adj`. If `W_adj` is empty, skip.
    d.  Perform a flood fill (e.g., BFS) starting from all pixels in `W_adj`:
        i.  The flood fill can only explore pixels that are white (0) or have a non-black color different from `C`. It cannot enter pixels with color `C`.
        ii. Keep track of all visited pixels during this fill (`visited_region`).
        iii. Keep track of all non-black, non-`C` pixels encountered during the fill (`internal_markers`).
        iv. During the fill, check if any visited pixel touches the grid border. If yes, set a flag `touches_border = True` and continue the fill to find all connected pixels but mark the region as non-enclosed.
    e.  After the flood fill, if `touches_border` is `False` (the region is enclosed):
        i.  Count the occurrences of each unique color among the `internal_markers`.
        ii. If the number of unique colors is greater than 1:
            *   Determine the most frequent color among `internal_markers`. If there's a tie in frequency, choose the color with the lowest numerical index. Let this be `fill_color`.
            *   Iterate through all pixels `(r, c)` in the `visited_region`. If the pixel `(r, c)` was originally white (input_grid[r, c] == 0), change its color in the output grid to `fill_color`.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
