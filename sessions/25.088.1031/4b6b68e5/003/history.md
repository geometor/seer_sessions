"""
The transformation identifies enclosed regions of white pixels (color 0) within the input grid. 
For each enclosed white region, it finds any non-white, non-boundary pixels ("marker pixels") located strictly inside that region. 
It then counts the occurrences of each color among these marker pixels. 
The most frequent marker color is determined. 
Finally, all the white pixels belonging to that specific enclosed region are recolored to this most frequent marker color in the output grid. 
If an enclosed white region contains no marker pixels, or if a white region is not fully enclosed, it remains unchanged.
The boundary pixels surrounding the regions also remain unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the failure and refine the approach.

**General Assessment**

The provided code attempts to identify enclosed white regions, find "marker" pixels inside them, determine the most frequent marker color, and fill the region with that color. However, the transformed outputs show that the white regions were not filled as expected in the actual outputs. This indicates a failure in one or more stages:

1.  **Region Identification/Enclosure:** The code might not be correctly identifying all connected white pixels or correctly determining if a region is truly enclosed (does not touch the grid boundary).
2.  **Marker Identification:** The `find_markers_inside` function seems to be the most likely point of failure. Its logic (BFS starting *from* white pixels and exploring *outwards*, even from markers) might not correctly capture the concept of markers *strictly inside* the enclosure defined by the boundary. The comparison between the code's output (often identical to input) and the expected output (where regions *are* filled) strongly suggests markers weren't found or processed correctly.
3.  **Filling Condition:** The original interpretation assumed *any* enclosed region with markers would be filled. The results suggest a potential additional condition might be necessary (e.g., a minimum number of markers).

**Strategy for Resolution**

1.  **Re-evaluate Marker Definition:** Define precisely what constitutes a "marker" pixel relative to a white region and its boundary. The previous code's BFS approach seems flawed. A better approach might be to identify all non-white, non-boundary pixels adjacent (8-directionally) to the white region's pixels.
2.  **Re-evaluate Filling Condition:** Analyze the examples where regions *should* have been filled versus those that remain white in the expected output. Check if there's a consistent difference, such as the *number* of distinct marker pixels found.
3.  **Refine Algorithm:** Update the natural language program and subsequent code implementation based on the revised understanding of markers and filling conditions. Ensure tie-breaking for the most frequent color is handled deterministically (e.g., lowest color index).

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

Let's analyze each example based on the refined understanding:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input contains three potential enclosed white regions bounded by red(2), blue(1), and green(3) respectively.
    *   **Region 1 (Red Boundary):**
        *   White Pixels: Yes, connected and enclosed.
        *   Boundary Pixels: The surrounding red(2) pixels.
        *   Potential Markers (Non-white, non-boundary, 8-adj to white): Gray(5) at (2,9), Azure(8) at (3,7), Azure(8) at (5,6), Azure(8) at (5,8).
        *   Marker Count: 4. (Greater than 1)
        *   Marker Colors: {5: 1, 8: 3}. Most Frequent: 8 (Azure).
        *   Expected Output: Region filled with 8. Matches.
    *   **Region 2 (Blue Boundary):**
        *   White Pixels: Yes, connected and enclosed.
        *   Boundary Pixels: The surrounding blue(1) pixels.
        *   Potential Markers: Gray(5) at (12,9), Gray(5) at (14,7), Gray(5) at (14,9), Azure(8) at (11,8).
        *   Marker Count: 4. (Greater than 1)
        *   Marker Colors: {5: 3, 8: 1}. Most Frequent: 5 (Gray).
        *   Expected Output: Region filled with 5. Matches.
    *   **Region 3 (Green Boundary):**
        *   White Pixels: Yes, connected and enclosed.
        *   Boundary Pixels: The surrounding green(3) pixels.
        *   Potential Markers: Azure(8) at (7,16).
        *   Marker Count: 1. (Not greater than 1)
        *   Expected Output: Region remains white. Matches.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input contains three potential enclosed white regions bounded by red(2), yellow(4), and green(6).
    *   **Region 1 (Red Boundary):**
        *   Markers: Green(3) at (2,8), Green(3) at (4,5), Azure(8) at (6,8).
        *   Marker Count: 3. (Greater than 1)
        *   Marker Colors: {3: 2, 8: 1}. Most Frequent: 3 (Green).
        *   Expected Output: Region filled with 3. Matches.
    *   **Region 2 (Yellow Boundary):**
        *   Markers: Azure(8) at (13,8), Green(3) at (13,10), Azure(8) at (13,12), Azure(8) at (14,8), Azure(8) at (15,12).
        *   Marker Count: 5. (Greater than 1)
        *   Marker Colors: {8: 4, 3: 1}. Most Frequent: 8 (Azure).
        *   Expected Output: Region filled with 8. Matches.
    *   **Region 3 (Green Boundary):**
        *   Markers: Green(3) at (3,15).
        *   Marker Count: 1. (Not greater than 1)
        *   Expected Output: Region remains white. Matches.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input contains two potential enclosed white regions bounded by green(3).
    *   **Region 1 (Center, Green Boundary):**
        *   Markers: Red(2) at (2,6), Azure(8) at (4,5), Azure(8) at (4,8),
