"""
The transformation identifies enclosed regions of white pixels (color 0) within the input grid. 
For each enclosed white region, it finds any non-white, non-boundary pixels ("marker pixels") located strictly inside that region. 
It then counts the occurrences of each color among these marker pixels. 
The most frequent marker color is determined. 
Finally, all the white pixels belonging to that specific enclosed region are recolored to this most frequent marker color in the output grid. 
If an enclosed white region contains no marker pixels, or if a white region is not fully enclosed, it remains unchanged.
The boundary pixels surrounding the regions also remain unchanged.
