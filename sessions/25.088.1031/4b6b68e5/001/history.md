*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input grids contain distinct shapes formed by contiguous non-white pixels (colors 1 through 9). These shapes act as boundaries.
    *   Some of these shapes fully enclose regions of white pixels (color 0).
    *   Within these enclosed white regions, there can be other non-white, non-boundary pixels ("marker pixels"). Examples include gray (5), azure (8), green (3), red (2), magenta (6).
    *   The task involves identifying these enclosed regions and filling the white pixels within them.
    *   The color used for filling is determined by the marker pixels present inside the specific enclosed region.
    *   Shapes or regions that are not fully enclosed remain unchanged.
    *   The boundary pixels of the shapes themselves remain unchanged in the output.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Objects:
      - name: Boundary Shape
        description: A contiguous area of non-white pixels forming the outer edge of a potential enclosure.
        properties:
          - color: The color of the pixels making up the boundary (not white).
          - closed: Boolean indicating if the shape forms a complete enclosure around an area of white pixels.
      - name: Enclosed Region
        description: An area of connected white pixels completely surrounded by a Boundary Shape.
        properties:
          - pixels: The set of coordinates corresponding to the white pixels within the region.
      - name: Marker Pixel
        description: A non-white pixel located within an Enclosed Region, distinct from the Boundary Shape pixels.
        properties:
          - color: The color of the marker pixel.
          - location: Coordinates within the Enclosed Region.

    Relationships:
      - type: Encloses
        subject: Boundary Shape
        object: Enclosed Region
        condition: Boundary Shape must be 'closed'.
      - type: Contains
        subject: Enclosed Region
        object: Marker Pixel
        condition: Marker Pixel's location is within the Enclosed Region's pixels.

    Actions:
      - name: Identify Enclosures
        description: Find all closed Boundary Shapes and their corresponding Enclosed Regions.
      - name: Analyze Interior
        description: For each Enclosed Region, identify all contained Marker Pixels.
      - name: Determine Fill Color
        description: Count the occurrences of each color among the Marker Pixels within an Enclosed Region. The color with the highest count becomes the Fill Color for that region. (Assumption: Ties are handled, though not explicitly shown how in examples. Let's assume the most frequent color is unique based on examples). If no Marker Pixels exist, the region is not filled.
      - name: Fill Region
        description: Change the color of all white pixels within an Enclosed Region to its determined Fill Color.

    Transformation Goal:
      - Modify the input grid by filling the white pixels of enclosed regions based on the most frequent color of the marker pixels found within each region.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify all distinct contiguous regions of white pixels (potential enclosed regions).
    3.  For each white region:
        a.  Determine if it is fully enclosed by a boundary of non-white pixels. Check if any white pixel in the region can reach the grid edge by moving only through white pixels. If it can reach the edge, the region is not enclosed.
        b.  If the region *is* enclosed:
            i.  Find all non-white pixels located strictly *within* this enclosed white region (these are the "marker pixels"). Ignore the boundary pixels themselves.
            ii. If marker pixels exist:
                1.  Count the frequency of each color among these marker pixels.
                2.  Identify the color that appears most frequently. This is the `fill_color`.
                3.  Iterate through all the pixel coordinates belonging to the enclosed white region.
                4.  Change the color of each of these pixels in the output grid to the `fill_color`.
            iii. If no marker pixels exist within the enclosed region, leave the region unchanged (it remains white).
    4.  Return the modified output grid.
