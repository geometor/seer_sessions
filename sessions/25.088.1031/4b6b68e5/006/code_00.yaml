task_description: Fill enclosed white regions based on the colors of internal non-boundary pixels.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous region of pixels of the same non-black color (1-9).
  - boundary_object: An 'object' that potentially encloses a region.
  - adjacent_white_pixels: White pixels (color 0) that are 4-directionally adjacent to any pixel of a boundary_object.
  - enclosed_region: The set of all pixels (white and non-boundary-color, non-black) reachable via 4-directional steps from 'adjacent_white_pixels' without crossing the 'boundary_object's pixels AND without touching the grid border.
  - internal_markers: Non-black pixels within an 'enclosed_region' that do not belong to the 'boundary_object'.
  - fill_condition: An 'enclosed_region' is filled if the number of unique colors among its 'internal_markers' is greater than 1.
  - fill_color_determination:
      criteria: Most frequent color among 'internal_markers'.
      tie_breaker: Lowest numerical color index wins.

examples:
  - id: 1
    input: Grid with Red(2), Blue(1), Green(3) objects containing internal Gray(5) and Azure(8) pixels.
    output: White regions enclosed by Red filled with Azure(8). White regions enclosed by Blue filled with Gray(5). Region enclosed by Green remains white.
    reasoning:
      - Red object: Encloses Gray(1), Azure(3). Unique=2 (>1). Max freq=Azure(8). Fill Azure.
      - Blue object: Encloses Gray(3), Azure(1). Unique=2 (>1). Max freq=Gray(5). Fill Gray.
      - Green object: Encloses Azure(1). Unique=1 (not >1). No fill.
  - id: 2
    input: Grid with Red(2), Yellow(4), Magenta(6) objects containing internal Green(3) and Azure(8) pixels.
    output: White regions enclosed by Red filled with Green(3). White regions enclosed by Yellow filled with Azure(8). Region enclosed by Magenta remains white.
    reasoning:
      - Red object: Encloses Green(2), Azure(1). Unique=2 (>1). Max freq=Green(3). Fill Green.
      - Yellow object: Encloses Green(1), Azure(4). Unique=2 (>1). Max freq=Azure(8). Fill Azure.
      - Magenta object: Encloses Green(1). Unique=1 (not >1). No fill.
  - id: 3
    input: Grid with a Green(3) object containing internal Red(2), Magenta(6), Azure(8) pixels.
    output: White region enclosed by Green filled with Magenta(6).
    reasoning:
      - Green object: Encloses Red(2), Azure(2), Magenta(3). Unique=3 (>1). Max freq=Magenta(6). Fill Magenta.

constraints:
  - Grid size: 1x1 to 30x30.
  - Colors: 0 (white/background) to 9.
  - Objects must not touch the grid border to be considered enclosing boundaries.
  - Only white pixels within the identified enclosed region are recolored.
