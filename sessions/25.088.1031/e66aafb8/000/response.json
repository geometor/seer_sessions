In some examples, this block is roughly centered, while in others, it's near an edge.\n    *   The output grid appears to be a direct copy (extraction) of a subgrid from the input grid.\n    *   The location and size of the output grid seem related to the location and size of the white block.\n    *   Comparing the output grid to the regions immediately surrounding the white block (above, below, left, right), the output consistently matches one of these adjacent regions in terms of both dimensions and pixel content.\n    *   The specific adjacent region chosen (above, below, left, or right) varies between examples, but in each case, only one of the four directly adjacent regions matches the output.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
