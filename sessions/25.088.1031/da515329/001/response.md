"""
The transformation applies a cellular automaton rule iteratively for a number of steps 
equal to the maximum of the grid's height and width.

1. Initialize the automaton state with the input grid.
2. Iterate `N = max(height, width)` times:
   a. Create a new grid for the next state, initialized to white (0).
   b. For each cell (r, c) in the current grid:
      i. Count the number of azure (8) neighbors in the 8 adjacent cells (Moore neighborhood). 
         Neighbors outside the grid boundaries are treated as white (0).
      ii. If the count of azure neighbors is odd, set the cell (r, c) in the new grid to azure (8).
      iii. Otherwise, the cell (r, c) in the new grid remains white (0).
   c. Update the current grid to be the new grid.
3. The final grid after N iterations is the output.
