"""
The transformation applies a cellular automaton rule iteratively for a number of steps 
equal to the maximum of the grid's height and width.

1. Initialize the automaton state with the input grid.
2. Iterate `N = max(height, width)` times:
   a. Create a new grid for the next state, initialized to white (0).
   b. For each cell (r, c) in the current grid:
      i. Count the number of azure (8) neighbors in the 8 adjacent cells (Moore neighborhood). 
         Neighbors outside the grid boundaries are treated as white (0).
      ii. If the count of azure neighbors is odd, set the cell (r, c) in the new grid to azure (8).
      iii. Otherwise, the cell (r, c) in the new grid remains white (0).
   c. Update the current grid to be the new grid.
3. The final grid after N iterations is the output.

**Analysis of Metrics and Examples:**

*   **Dimensions:** Input and output grids always have the same dimensions. The code preserved dimensions correctly.
*   **Color Palette:** Only white (0) and azure (8) are used in inputs and outputs. The code used the correct colors.
*   **Azure Count:** The number of azure pixels increases significantly from input to output in all expected outputs. The transformed outputs from the previous code also increased the azure count, but not nearly enough and in the wrong places.
*   **Pattern:** The output patterns are complex and fill a large portion of the grid, originating from the initial small 'seed' of azure pixels. The pattern looks somewhat like a Sierpinski triangle or related fractal/cellular automaton pattern. Let's investigate Rule 90 specifically.

**Rule 90:**
Rule 90 is a 1D elementary cellular automaton where a cell's next state is the XOR (sum modulo 2) of its left and right neighbors' states in the previous step.
`new_state(i) = state(i-1) XOR state(i+1)`

**Hypothesis: 2D Adaptation of Rule 90?**
How could Rule 90 be adapted to 2D with an 8-neighbor (Moore) neighborhood?
*   Previous code: `new_state(r, c) = sum(neighbors) % 2`. This failed.
*   What if we consider diagonal neighbors? Rule 90 uses the two neighbors in 1D. In 2D, perhaps the relevant neighbors are the diagonal ones? Let's test this: `new_state(r, c) = (state(r-1, c-1) + state(r-1, c+1) + state(r+1, c-1) + state(r+1, c+1)) % 2`. (Assuming state is 0 or 1, mapping azure to 1).
*   What if it considers cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right)? `new_state(r, c) = (state(r-1, c) + state(r+1, c) + state(r, c-1) + state(r, c+1)) % 2`.
*   What if the cell's own state is involved? `new_state(r, c) = (state(r, c) + sum(neighbors)) % 2`? Unlikely for Rule 90 type patterns.

Let's manually check the "cardinal neighbors sum mod 2" hypothesis on a small section of Example 2's input.
Input:

```
... ... ...
. 0 8 0 .
. 8 0 8 .
. 0 8 0 .
... ... ...
```

Let's map Azure (8) to 1 and White (0) to 0 for calculation.
Grid at t=0:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Calculate Grid at t=1 using Cardinal Neighbors Sum % 2:

This generates a cross pattern expanding outwards. Let's compare this to the expected output after many steps. The expected outputs look like filled triangles/diamonds. This "cardinal neighbors sum mod 2" rule seems plausible for generating patterns like the output. It resembles the growth of a 2D Rule 90 pattern.

**Iteration Count:** The previous code used `N = max(height, width)`. Let's check if this makes sense.
Ex 1: 22x22 -> N=22
Ex 2: 12x12 -> N=12
Ex 3: 16x16 -> N=16
The patterns in the output seem to reach or approach the grid boundaries. The number of iterations being related to the grid size seems correct. The pattern expands roughly one cell per iteration, so `max(h, w)` iterations would allow the pattern to potentially fill the grid.

**Revised Hypothesis:** The transformation is a cellular automaton iterated `N = max(height, width)` times. The rule is: a cell's next state is azure (8) if the sum of the states (0 for white, 1 for azure) of its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the previous state is odd. Otherwise, the cell's next state is white (0). Cells outside the boundary are treated as white (0).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Apply a cellular automaton rule for a number of steps equal to the maximum dimension of the grid.
grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - Dimensions vary across examples (22x22, 12x12, 16x16).
  - Only two colors are present: white (0) and azure (8).
initial_state:
  - The input grid contains a small number of azure (8) pixels acting as a seed pattern.
  - Seed patterns vary: 'H' shape, diamond shape, cross shape.
transformation:
  - A cellular automaton rule is applied iteratively.
  - The number of iterations is `N = max(grid_height, grid_width)`.
  - The rule determines the next state of each cell based on its neighbors in the previous state.
  - Cells outside the grid boundary are treated as white (0).
automaton_rule:
  - A cell's state depends on the sum of the states of its *cardinal* neighbors (up, down, left, right).
  - Let azure=1 and white=0.
  - If the sum of the four cardinal neighbors' states is odd, the cell becomes azure (8) in the next step.
  - If the sum is even, the cell becomes white (0) in the next step.
final_state:
  - The output grid shows a complex pattern, often resembling a Sierpinski triangle/carpet grown from the initial seed.
  - The number of azure pixels is significantly larger in the output compared to the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the current grid state with the input grid. Convert azure (8) pixels to 1 and white (0) pixels to 0 for calculation.
2.  Determine the number of iterations `N` as the maximum of the grid's height and width.
3.  Repeat `N` times:
    a. Create a new grid for the next state, initialized entirely with 0s (white).
    b. For each cell `(r, c)` in the current grid:
        i. Identify its four cardinal neighbors: `(r-1, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c+1)`.
        ii. Treat neighbors outside the grid boundaries as having a state of 0.
        iii. Calculate the sum of the states (0 or 1) of these four neighbors from the *current* grid.
        iv. If the sum is odd (i.e., sum % 2 == 1), set the state of cell `(r, c)` in the *new* grid to 1.
        v. Otherwise (if the sum is even), the state of cell `(r, c)` in the *new* grid remains 0.
    c. Update the current grid to be the new grid.
4.  After `N` iterations, convert the final grid state back to the original color scheme: change all 1s back to azure (8).
5.  Return the final grid.## General Assessment

The previous code implemented a cellular automaton rule based on the Moore neighborhood (8 neighbors) sum modulo 2. The execution results clearly show this rule is incorrect, as it failed to reproduce the expected output for any of the training examples, including the one it was originally based on. The transformed outputs differ significantly from the expected outputs in terms of the pattern and the count of azure pixels.

The strategy is to re-evaluate the relationship between the input and output across all examples to find a consistent rule. The output patterns strongly suggest a cellular automaton, possibly related to Rule 90 known for generating Sierpinski triangle patterns, but adapted for a 2D grid. The key is to identify the correct neighborhood and update rule. The number of iterations being `max(height, width)` seems plausible given the extent of the patterns in the outputs.

## Metrics

Based on the `code_output`:
| Metric                  | Example 1      | Example 2      | Example 3      |
| :---------------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| Input Shape             | (22, 22)       | (12, 12)       | (16, 16)       |
| Output Shape            | (22, 22)       | (12, 12)       | (16, 16)       |
| Input Azure Count       | 12             | 4              | 8              |
| Expected Output Azure Count | 239            | 73             | 127            |
| Transformed Output Azure Count (Old Code) | 182            | 33             | 20             |
| Pixels Off (Old Code)   | 287            | 72             | 113            |

**Observations from Metrics:**
*   Grid dimensions are preserved.
*   The number of azure (8) pixels increases substantially from input to output.
*   The previous code failed to generate the correct patterns and counts.
*   The rule needs to account for a significant 'growth' or spread of the azure color.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Evolve an initial pattern of azure pixels on a white background using a cellular automaton rule for a specific number of steps.
grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids share the same dimensions.
  - Grid sizes vary between examples (e.g., 22x22, 12x12, 16x16).
  - The grid contains only two colors: white (0) as the background and azure (8) for the pattern.
initial_state:
  - The input grid represents the initial state (step 0) of the automaton.
  - It features a small configuration of azure pixels ('seed').
transformation:
  - A deterministic cellular automaton rule updates the grid state iteratively.
  - The number of iterations `N` is equal to the maximum dimension (height or width) of the grid.
  - The state of a cell in the next iteration depends on the states of its neighbors in the current iteration.
  - Boundary condition: Cells outside the grid are considered white (0).
automaton_rule:
  - The neighborhood considered for updating a cell consists of its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
  - The update rule is based on the parity (odd/even) of the sum of the states of these neighbors.
  - Map colors for calculation: white (0) -> 0, azure (8) -> 1.
  - A cell at `(r, c)` becomes azure (state 1) in the next step if the sum of the states of its cardinal neighbors `(r-1, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c+1)` in the current step is odd.
  - Otherwise, the cell becomes white (state 0).
final_state:
  - The output grid is the state of the automaton after `N` iterations.
  - The final pattern resembles a 2D Sierpinski triangle/carpet generated from the initial seed configuration.
  - Convert states back to colors: 0 -> white (0), 1 -> azure (8).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Determine the grid's height (`H`) and width (`W`).
3.  Calculate the number of iterations `N = max(H, W)`.
4.  Initialize the current automaton state (`current_grid`) based on the input grid, representing azure (8) as 1 and white (0) as 0.
5.  Loop `N` times:
    a. Create a new empty grid (`next_grid`) of the same dimensions `H` x `W`, initialized with 0s.
    b. Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` from row `r=0` to `H-1` and column `c=0` to `W-1` of the `current_grid`.
    c. For the cell `(r, c)`, find the states (0 or 1) of its four cardinal neighbors:
        i.  Top neighbor: state at `(r-1, c)` in `current_grid` (or 0 if `r=0`).
        ii. Bottom neighbor: state at `(r+1, c)` in `current_grid` (or 0 if `r=H-1`).
        iii. Left neighbor: state at `(r, c-1)` in `current_grid` (or 0 if `c=0`).
        iv. Right neighbor: state at `(r, c+1)` in `current_grid` (or 0 if `c=W-1`).
    d. Calculate the sum of the states of these four neighbors.
    e. Check if the sum is odd (`sum % 2 == 1`).
    f. If the sum is odd, set the value of cell `(r, c)` in `next_grid` to 1.
    g. If the sum is even, the value of cell `(r, c)` in `next_grid` remains 0.
    h. After iterating through all cells, replace `current_grid` with `next_grid`.
6.  After the loop finishes, create the final output grid by converting the states in the `current_grid` back to colors: replace 1s with azure (8) and keep 0s as white (0).
7.  Return the final output grid.
