Each object is defined by a solid colored border (colors vary: green, azure, yellow, red, orange, magenta, blue, gray) enclosing a pattern of internal white pixels. The objects are separated from each other by at least one row/column of white pixels.\n\nThe transformation modifies the *interior* of these colored objects. Specifically, it identifies contiguous areas of white pixels that are completely surrounded by the object's colored border (i.e., these white pixels are not reachable from the main white background outside the object without crossing the colored border). These \"enclosed\" or \"internal hole\" white areas are then filled with the color of the object's border. White pixels within an object that *are* connected to the external background remain white. The colored borders themselves and the external white background remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
