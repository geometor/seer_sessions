elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - object: background
    description: The main area of the grid, typically represented by white pixels (0).
  - object: shape
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels forming a border, often rectangular.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the border pixels (non-zero value).
      - location: Position within the grid.
      - boundary: The pixels forming the outer edge of the shape.
      - interior: The area enclosed by the boundary.
  - object: internal_white_area
    description: A contiguous area of white pixels (0) located within the interior of a shape.
    properties:
      - location: Position within a shape's interior.
      - connectivity: Whether the area is connected to the external background via a path of white pixels.
  - object: enclosed_white_area (hole)
    description: An internal_white_area that is not connected to the external background. It is completely surrounded by the shape's colored pixels.

relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: internal_white_area
    object: shape
    description: Internal white areas exist within the boundaries of shapes.
  - type: adjacency
    subject: internal_white_area
    object: background
    description: Some internal white areas may be adjacent to (connected to) the external background through paths of white pixels.
  - type: separation
    subject: enclosed_white_area
    object: background
    description: Enclosed white areas are separated from the external background by the shape's colored pixels.

actions:
  - action: identify
    subject: shapes
    description: Locate all distinct colored shapes within the input grid.
  - action: identify
    subject: internal_white_areas
    within: each shape
    description: Locate all areas of white pixels inside each identified shape.
  - action: check_connectivity
    subject: internal_white_areas
    target: background
    description: Determine if each internal white area has a path of white pixels connecting it to the main background outside the shape.
  - action: fill
    subject: enclosed_white_areas
    color: Use the color of the surrounding shape's border.
    description: Change the color of pixels belonging to enclosed white areas (those not connected to the background) to match the color of the shape's border.

transformation:
  - step: Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
  - step: If a white pixel (0) is found, check if it belongs to an enclosed area.
  - step: To check for enclosure, perform a reachability analysis (e.g., flood fill or BFS) starting from that white pixel, only moving through other white pixels.
  - step: If the reachability analysis cannot reach any pixel on the absolute border of the grid (meaning it's trapped within a colored shape), then this white pixel belongs to an enclosed area.
  - step: Identify the color of the adjacent non-white pixels (this will be the color of the enclosing shape).
  - step: In the output grid, change the color of this pixel (and all other white pixels identified as part of the same enclosed area) to the color of the enclosing shape.
  - step: If a white pixel *can* reach the grid border, or if the pixel is non-white, copy its color directly from the input to the output grid.
