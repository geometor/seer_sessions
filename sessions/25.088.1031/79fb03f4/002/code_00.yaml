Input:
  Grid: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  Colors present: white (0), blue (1), gray (5), azure (8).
  Objects:
    - Pixels: Individual cells with a color.
    - Seeds: Pixels with blue (1) color.
    - Boundaries: Pixels with gray (5) or azure (8) color. Also, the edges of the grid act as boundaries.
    - Regions: Contiguous areas of white (0) pixels.

Output:
  Grid: A 2D array of pixels, same dimensions as the input.
  Colors present: Same as input (white, blue, gray, azure).
  Transformation: Some white (0) pixels are changed to blue (1). Blue (1), gray (5), and azure (8) pixels remain unchanged.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share an edge (orthogonal: up, down, left, right). Diagonal adjacency is not used.
  - Reachability: A white (0) pixel is reachable from a seed (blue 1) if a path exists between them consisting only of white (0) pixels, using orthogonal adjacency.
  - Containment: The fill process is contained. A white (0) pixel is filled only if it is reachable from a seed (blue 1) without crossing a boundary (gray 5, azure 8, or grid edge).

Action:
  - Flood Fill: Originate a fill process from each blue (1) seed pixel.
  - Propagation: The fill spreads into orthogonally adjacent white (0) pixels.
  - Termination: The fill stops when it encounters a boundary pixel (gray 5, azure 8) or the grid edge. White pixels separated from seeds by boundaries are not filled.
