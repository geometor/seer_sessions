  - name: Identify
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [initial_blue_locations, initial_white_locations, barrier_locations]

  - name: Flood Fill
    inputs: [input_grid, initial_blue_locations, barrier_locations]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: >
      Perform a flood fill (e.g., BFS) starting simultaneously from all white pixels
      orthogonally adjacent to any initial blue pixel. The fill propagates only into
      white pixels. The fill is blocked by grid boundaries and pixels that were
      initially gray (5) or azure (8).

    inputs: [pixel_location, output_grid]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: "Change the color of white pixels reached by the flood fill to blue (1) in the output grid."
  - name: Preserve Color
    inputs: [pixel_location, input_grid, output_grid]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: "Ensure pixels initially blue (1), gray (5), or azure (8) retain their original color in the output grid. Ensure white pixels not reached by the fill remain white (0)."
