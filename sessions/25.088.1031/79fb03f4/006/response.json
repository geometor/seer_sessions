This confirms the previous code overfills. The number of blue pixels in the `transformed_output` equals the initial blue plus initial white, minus any blue pixels that might have been blocked (which doesn't happen in the flawed code).\n*   **Barriers:** The `barriers_respected (expected)` is `true` for all examples. This strongly suggests that gray (5) and azure (8) pixels in the input grid remain unchanged and act as boundaries that stop the spread of blue color into adjacent white areas.\n*   **Adjacency:** The metrics `count_adjacent_white_that_turned_blue` and `count_adjacent_white_that_stayed_white` show that *not all* white pixels immediately adjacent to an initial blue pixel turn blue in the expected output. This is crucial. In Example 1, 8 white pixels are adjacent to the 3 initial blue pixels, but only 3 of those adjacent white pixels turn blue. Why? Looking at Example 1 again, the initial blue at (6,0) touches white at (6,1), (5,0), (7,0). White at (6,1) turns blue. White at (7,0) turns blue. But white at (5,0) does *not* turn blue. Why not? Let's re-examine the connectivity and barriers.\n\n**Revisiting Example 1:**\nInput:\n"

            "text": "\nWait, looking closer at the expected output for Example 1, the pixel at (5,0) *does* turn blue in the expected output (it's a 1)! My previous reading was wrong. Let me re-check the `count_adjacent_white_that_stayed_white` metric calculation or my interpretation.\n\nAh, the metric counts white pixels adjacent to *any* initial blue. Let's trace for Example 1:\n- Blue at (6,0): Adjacent white: (5,0), (6,1), (7,0). Expected output: (5,0)->1, (6,1)->1, (7,0)->1.\n- Blue at (11,0): Adjacent white: (10,0), (11,1), (12,0). Expected output: (10,0)->1, (11,1)->1, (12,0)->1.\n- Blue at (15,0): Adjacent white: (14,0), (15,1), (16,0). Expected output: (14,0)->1, (15,1)->1, (16,0)->1.\n\nOkay, so *all* white pixels immediately adjacent to an initial blue pixel *do* seem to turn blue. The discrepancy in the metric might arise if a pixel is counted as \"remained white\" because it was adjacent to *one* blue pixel but ultimately remained white because it wasn't part of the filled region propagating from *another* blue pixel, or perhaps the definition of adjacency in the metric code doesn't match the fill logic perfectly.\n\nLet's stick to the visual evidence and the core idea: The blue \"spreads\" or \"floods\" from the initial blue pixels into connected white pixels, stopping only at gray, azure, or grid boundaries.\n\nThe previous code failed because it identified components first and then filled the *entire* component if *any* part touched blue. The correct approach is a flood fill originating *simultaneously* from all initial blue pixel locations.\n\n**Flood Fill Logic:**\n1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Create a queue (or multiple queues, one for each source) for a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS).\n3. Add all coordinates of *white* pixels that are orthogonally adjacent to any *initial* blue pixel to the queue. Mark these initial white pixels as 'blue' in the output grid and keep track of visited cells to avoid cycles and redundant work. A good way to track visited is to use a separate boolean grid, or simply check if the output grid cell is already blue.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n    a. Dequeue a coordinate (r, c). This pixel is now blue.\n    b. Examine its orthogonal neighbors (nr, nc).\n    c. If a neighbor (nr, nc) is within bounds AND is currently white (value 0 in the *input* grid) AND hasn't been turned blue yet (check the *output* grid or visited set):\n        i. Change the neighbor's color to blue (1) in the *output* grid.\n        ii. Enqueue the neighbor's coordinate (nr, nc).\n5. Continue until the queue is empty. All reachable white pixels will have been filled.\n6. Return the modified output grid.\n\nThis approach correctly handles the spread and respects the barriers (gray, azure) because the flood fill only enters white cells and implicitly stops at non-white cells or boundaries. It also handles cases where multiple blue sources might fill the same white region correctly.\n\n**Final check on \"boundary colors\"**: The previous code listed `boundary_colors = {gray, azure, blue}`. The inclusion of `blue` here might have been part of the issue. While initial blue pixels *start* the fill, the fill process itself should treat *any* non-white cell (gray, azure, or even an initial blue cell it bumps into again) as a boundary it cannot cross.\n\n---\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code incorrectly identified entire connected components of white pixels and filled them completely if any part was adjacent to an initial blue pixel. The analysis of failed examples shows that the transformation is actually a \"flood fill\" process. The fill originates from the initial blue pixels, spreads orthogonally into adjacent white pixels, and continues spreading through connected white pixels. This spread is blocked by gray (5) pixels, azure (8) pixels, and the grid boundaries. Pixels that are initially gray, azure, or blue remain unchanged. White pixels that are not reached by the flood fill also remain unchanged. The previous code overfilled white areas because it didn't correctly model the barrier-limited spread from the source pixels.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nThe `tool_code` execution provided detailed metrics confirming the observations:\n\n1.  **Overfilling:** The `transformed_output` consistently converted all initial white pixels to blue, whereas the `expected_output` only converted a subset (`white_pixels_changed_to_blue (expected)` vs `white_pixels_changed_to_blue (transformed)`). The number of white pixels remaining in the `expected_output` (`white_pixels_remained_white (expected)`) was significant in all cases.\n2.  **Barriers:** The metric `barriers_respected (expected)` was `True` for all examples, confirming that gray (5) and azure (8) pixels act as impenetrable barriers for the blue fill process in the correct transformation. They retain their original color in the output.\n3.  **Source Adjacency:** While the metrics concerning adjacency (`count_adjacent_white_that_turned_blue` vs `count_adjacent_white_that_stayed_white`) were initially confusing, closer inspection suggests the core rule is simpler: the fill starts at the interface between initial blue and adjacent white cells and propagates outwards from there. The fill process itself determines which adjacent white cells ultimately become blue as part of the larger filled region.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

(Pixels that were initially gray (5), azure (8), or blue (1) remain unchanged throughout this process, as does any white pixel not reached by the fill).## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code attempts to solve the task by identifying connected components of white pixels and changing their color to blue if they are adjacent to an initial blue pixel. However, the results show that this logic is incorrect, as it leads to overfilling nearly all white areas in the `Transformed Output`, while the `Expected Output` shows a more selective filling pattern.\n\nThe key discrepancy lies in how \"connected components\" and \"adjacency\" are used. The correct transformation appears to be a \"flood fill\" or \"spreading\" process originating from the initial blue pixels. This blue color spreads into adjacent white pixels and continues through connected white areas, but this spread is contained or blocked by specific barrier colors (gray - 5, azure - 8) and the grid boundaries. The previous code failed because it identified the entire white component first and colored it all blue if *any* part touched a blue source, ignoring the barrier effect within the component.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is to replace the component-based logic with a flood fill algorithm (like Breadth-First Search) starting from the white cells adjacent to the initial blue cells, respecting the barrier conditions during the fill propagation.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nThe `tool_code` execution provided metrics confirming the flood fill hypothesis and barrier behavior:\n\n1.  **Overfilling Confirmed:** In all examples, the `transformed_output` converted significantly more white pixels to blue than the `expected_output`. The `transformed_output` consistently ended up with 0 white pixels, demonstrating the flawed nature of the previous component-filling approach.\n2.  **Barrier Integrity:** The `barriers_respected (expected)` metric was `True` across all examples. This confirms that gray (5) and azure (8) pixels act as strict boundaries that are not changed and block the spread of the blue color in the correct transformation.\n3.  **Fill Origin:** The fill starts from white pixels adjacent to initial blue pixels. The flood fill process itself determines the final extent of the blue region, bounded by barriers.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
