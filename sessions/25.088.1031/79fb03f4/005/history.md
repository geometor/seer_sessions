Performs a flood fill operation on the input grid.
The fill originates from all blue (1) pixels simultaneously.

The fill is blocked by gray (5) pixels, azure (8) pixels, and the grid boundaries.
Blue (1), gray (5), and azure (8) pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output.
Only white (0) pixels reachable from a blue (1) pixel without crossing a boundary are changed to blue (1).

## General Assessment

The provided Python code implements a standard multi-source flood fill algorithm starting from blue (1) pixels, spreading into adjacent white (0) pixels, and blocked by gray (5), azure (8), and grid boundaries. However, the results show that this function incorrectly fills far more white pixels than expected across all examples. The expected outputs show a much more constrained or localized blue fill.

The key observation is that the blue fill in the expected outputs does not propagate to *all* reachable white pixels. Instead, it seems confined to specific regions or components of white pixels that are directly associated with the initial blue pixels. The previous flood fill logic failed because it assumed any white pixel reachable from *any* blue source (even indirectly through other filled white pixels) should be filled.

The strategy is to refine the transformation rule by identifying the exact condition under which a white pixel should be filled. The most promising hypothesis is that the fill operates on pre-defined connected components of white space.

## Metrics and Analysis

*   **Color Palette:** The input grids use white (0), blue (1), gray (5), and azure (8). The output grids use the same colors. Blue, gray, and azure pixels are static; only white pixels can change.
*   **Transformation:** White (0) pixels change to blue (1) under specific conditions.
*   **Boundaries:** Gray (5), azure (8), and the grid edges act as barriers, defining regions.
*   **Source:** The transformation originates from the blue (1) pixels present in the input.
*   **Error Pattern:** The previous code over-filled white areas. The expected outputs show that only certain connected regions of white pixels adjacent to the initial blue sources are filled.
*   **Revised Hypothesis ("White Component Adjacency"):**
    1.  Identify all connected components of white (0) pixels in the input grid. Connectivity is defined by orthogonal adjacency. Movement is blocked by gray (5), azure (8), and grid boundaries.
    2.  Determine which of these white components are orthogonally adjacent to at least one original blue (1) pixel from the input grid.
    3.  Fill *all* pixels belonging to these adjacent white components with blue (1). White components not adjacent to any original blue pixel remain unchanged.

*   **Code Execution Results Analysis**:
