Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels represented by integers 0-9 (colors).
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors observed are white (0), blue (1), gray (5), and azure (8).
3.  **Core Transformation:** The primary change between input and output grids is the conversion of some white (0) pixels to blue (1) pixels.
4.  **Boundary Pixels:** Gray (5) and azure (8) pixels appear to act as boundaries or walls. These pixels remain unchanged between the input and output grids.
5.  **Seed Pixels:** The input grids contain one or more blue (1) pixels. These seem to act as starting points or "seeds" for the transformation. These seed pixels also remain unchanged in the output.
6.  **Filling Mechanism:** The blue color spreads outwards from the initial seed blue pixels into adjacent white (0) pixels (up, down, left, right). This spreading stops when it encounters a boundary pixel (gray 5 or azure 8) or the edge of the grid. This resembles a flood fill algorithm.
7.  **Result:** The output grid is the input grid with certain regions of white pixels filled with blue, where the filled regions are defined by the boundaries and initiated by the seed blue pixels.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions (variable height and width)
      - contains pixels with color values
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color (white: 0, blue: 1, gray: 5, azure: 8)
      - location (row, column)
objects:
  - type: boundary
    identified_by:
      - color is gray (5) or azure (8)
    properties:
      - static (position and color unchanged from input to output)
      - blocks the spread of blue color
  - type: seed
    identified_by:
      - color is blue (1) in the input grid
    properties:
      - static (position and color unchanged from input to output)
      - initiates the color spread
  - type: fillable_space
    identified_by:
      - color is white (0) in the input grid
    properties:
      - potentially changes color to blue (1) in the output
      - change depends on connectivity to a seed pixel without crossing boundaries
actions:
  - name: flood_fill
    parameters:
      - start_points: locations of all seed pixels (blue 1 in input)
      - fill_color: blue (1)
      - target_color: white (0)
      - boundary_colors: [gray (5), azure (8)]
      - grid_edges: act as implicit boundaries
    process:
      - Starting from all seed locations simultaneously (or iteratively), change adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels to blue.
      - Continue spreading from newly changed blue pixels.
      - Stop spreading at boundary colors or grid edges.
relationships:
  - A fillable_space pixel changes to blue if there is a path of adjacent white pixels connecting it back to a seed pixel, without passing through any boundary pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are blue (1). These are the "seed" locations.
3.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are gray (5) or azure (8). These are the "boundary" locations.
4.  Create a list of locations to process, initially containing all seed locations.
5.  Create a set or list to keep track of visited locations to avoid redundant processing, initially containing all seed locations.
6.  While the list of locations to process is not empty:
    a.  Remove one location (current\_row, current\_col) from the list.
    b.  Examine its four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right).
    c.  For each neighbor (neighbor\_row, neighbor\_col):
        i.  Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.
        ii. Check if the neighbor location has already been visited.
        iii. Check if the neighbor pixel in the *input* grid is white (0).
        iv. If all checks pass (within bounds, not visited, is white):
            1.  Change the color of the neighbor pixel in the *output* grid to blue (1).
            2.  Add the neighbor location to the list of locations to process.
            3.  Mark the neighbor location as visited.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
