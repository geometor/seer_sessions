These pixels remain unchanged between the input and output grids.\n5.  **Seed Pixels:** The input grids contain one or more blue (1) pixels. These seem to act as starting points or \"seeds\" for the transformation. These seed pixels also remain unchanged in the output.\n6.  **Filling Mechanism:** The blue color spreads outwards from the initial seed blue pixels into adjacent white (0) pixels (up, down, left, right). This spreading stops when it encounters a boundary pixel (gray 5 or azure 8) or the edge of the grid. This resembles a flood fill algorithm.\n7.  **Result:** The output grid is the input grid with certain regions of white pixels filled with blue, where the filled regions are defined by the boundaries and initiated by the seed blue pixels.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
