elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions (variable height and width)
      - contains pixels with color values
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color (white: 0, blue: 1, gray: 5, azure: 8)
      - location (row, column)
objects:
  - type: boundary
    identified_by:
      - color is gray (5) or azure (8)
    properties:
      - static (position and color unchanged from input to output)
      - blocks the spread of blue color
  - type: seed
    identified_by:
      - color is blue (1) in the input grid
    properties:
      - static (position and color unchanged from input to output)
      - initiates the color spread
  - type: fillable_space
    identified_by:
      - color is white (0) in the input grid
    properties:
      - potentially changes color to blue (1) in the output
      - change depends on connectivity to a seed pixel without crossing boundaries
actions:
  - name: flood_fill
    parameters:
      - start_points: locations of all seed pixels (blue 1 in input)
      - fill_color: blue (1)
      - target_color: white (0)
      - boundary_colors: [gray (5), azure (8)]
      - grid_edges: act as implicit boundaries
    process:
      - Starting from all seed locations simultaneously (or iteratively), change adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels to blue.
      - Continue spreading from newly changed blue pixels.
      - Stop spreading at boundary colors or grid edges.
relationships:
  - A fillable_space pixel changes to blue if there is a path of adjacent white pixels connecting it back to a seed pixel, without passing through any boundary pixels.
