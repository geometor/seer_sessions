Context:
  Grid_Type: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  Background_Color: White (0).
Input_Objects:
  - Type: Block
    Shape: 2x2 square
    Colors: [Azure (8), Red (2)]
    Quantity: Variable (at least 2 in examples)
    Placement: Scattered across the grid.
Output_Objects:
  - Type: Block (copied from input)
    Shape: 2x2 square
    Colors: [Azure (8), Red (2)]
  - Type: Path
    Shape: Rectangle (2 rows high for horizontal, 2 columns wide for vertical)
    Color: Orange (7)
    Placement: Between pairs of original Blocks.
Transformation_Rule:
  Action: Add_Paths
  Trigger: Pairs of Blocks (from Input_Objects).
  Condition:
    - Alignment: Pair must be perfectly aligned horizontally (same starting row) OR vertically (same starting column).
    - Clearance: The rectangular region directly between the aligned pair (along the alignment axis, excluding the blocks themselves) must contain only Background_Color (0) pixels in the input grid.
  Effect:
    - For each valid pair, fill the clearance region defined above with Path color (Orange 7) in the output grid.
    - The path should have the same thickness (2 pixels) as the blocks it connects.
Relationships:
  - Paths connect Blocks.
  - Connection requires Alignment and Clearance.
Anomalies:
  - train_3: One connection (Azure(6,1) to Red(6,8)) seems to meet the criteria but is not drawn in the output. The rule derived from other examples would predict this connection.
