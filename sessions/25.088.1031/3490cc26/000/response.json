            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Composition:** The input grids consist primarily of a white (0) background. Scattered within the grid are distinct 2x2 blocks of non-white colors, specifically azure (8) and occasionally red (2).\n2.  **Output Grid Composition:** The output grids are identical to the input grids in terms of the background and the original azure/red 2x2 blocks. The key difference is the addition of new pixels colored orange (7).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves adding these orange pixels.\n4.  **Orange Pixel Pattern:** The orange pixels form straight paths, either purely horizontal or purely vertical. These paths are consistently 2 pixels thick, matching the thickness of the azure/red blocks.\n5.  **Path Placement:** The orange paths act as connectors *between* pairs of the original azure or red blocks. A path is drawn only if:\n    *   The two blocks are perfectly aligned either horizontally (sharing the same starting row indices) or vertically (sharing the same starting column indices).\n    *   The rectangular area directly between the two aligned blocks, along the axis of alignment, consists *only* of white (0) pixels in the input grid. The path must not cross over any other non-white block.\n6.  **Connectivity:** It appears that *all* pairs of blocks meeting the alignment and clear path criteria are connected in the output grid (with a noted anomaly in train\\_3 where one potential connection seems omitted). The connections can be Azure-to-Azure, Azure-to-Red, or Red-to-Azure.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Identify all distinct 2x2 blocks of non-white pixels (Azure 8 or Red 2) in the input grid. Store their top-left coordinates (row, column).\n3.  Examine every possible unique pair of these identified blocks (Block A and Block B).\n4.  For each pair:\n    a.  **Check Vertical Alignment:** If Block A and Block B have the same starting column:\n        i.  Find which block is higher (Top Block) and which is lower (Bottom Block).\n        ii.
