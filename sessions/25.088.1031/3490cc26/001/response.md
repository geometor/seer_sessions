"""
Identifies all distinct 2x2 blocks of non-white pixels (Azure 8 or Red 2) in the input grid.
For every unique pair of these blocks:
1. Checks if they are perfectly aligned either horizontally (same starting row) or vertically (same starting column).
2. If aligned, checks if the rectangular region directly between them (along the alignment axis, 2 pixels thick) consists only of white (0) background pixels in the original input grid.
3. If both conditions (alignment and clear path) are met, fills the connecting path region in the output grid with orange (7) pixels.
The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid and is modified by adding these orange paths.
