            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.\n\n**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe previous code attempted to find the largest *maximal contiguous rectangle* for each color and turn it yellow. The results clearly show this is incorrect. The yellow areas in the expected outputs are often not rectangular, and the areas selected by the code do not match the expected areas.\n\nThe key discrepancy lies in the definition of the \"object\" to be modified. The initial assumption was \"maximal rectangle,\" but the expected outputs suggest the relevant object is the \"largest contiguous component\" (or \"blob\") of a given color, irrespective of its shape. The size is likely determined by the number of pixels in the component.\n\nOur strategy will be:\n1.  Verify the unique colors present in each input.\n2.  For each non-white color, identify all distinct contiguous components (connected pixels of the same color, using 4-way adjacency).\n3.  Calculate the size (pixel count) of each component.\n4.  Find the component with the maximum size for each color.\n5.  Compare the locations and shapes of these largest components with the yellow regions in the expected outputs.\n6.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program based on these findings.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
