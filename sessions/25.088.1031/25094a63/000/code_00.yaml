elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - height: 30
      - width: 30
      - pixels: variety of colors (0-9)
  - element: rectangular_block
    description: A contiguous rectangular area within the grid composed of a single color.
    properties:
      - color: The single color filling the block (value 1-9).
      - location: Defined by top-left corner (row, column).
      - dimensions: height and width.
      - area: height * width.
      - maximality: The block cannot be extended further in any direction while maintaining the single color and rectangular shape.
objects:
  - object: target_block
    definition: For each distinct color C (1-9) present in the input grid, the maximal rectangular_block of color C that has the largest area compared to all other maximal rectangular_blocks of the same color C.
actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    description: Find all unique colors (1-9) present in the input grid.
  - action: find_maximal_rectangles
    description: For a given color, find all maximal contiguous rectangular blocks of that color in the input grid.
  - action: calculate_area
    description: Compute the area (height * width) for each identified rectangular block.
  - action: find_largest_rectangle_per_color
    description: For each color identified, determine which of its maximal rectangular blocks has the largest area. Select this block as the target_block for that color.
  - action: recolor_block
    description: Change the color of all pixels within a specified rectangular block to a target color.
    parameters:
      - block: The rectangular block to modify (defined by location and dimensions).
      - target_color: The new color to fill the block with (yellow - 4).
relationships:
  - relationship: input_output_correspondence
    description: The output grid is initially identical to the input grid.
  - relationship: modification_trigger
    description: A rectangular block in the input grid is modified in the output grid only if it is the target_block (largest area rectangle) for its specific color.
transformation:
  - step: Copy the input grid to create the initial output grid.
  - step: Identify the set of unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
  - step: For each unique color found:
      - Find all maximal contiguous rectangular blocks of that color.
      - Calculate the area of each block.
      - Select the block with the maximum area for this color.
  - step: For each selected largest block (one per color):
      - Recolor the corresponding region in the output grid to yellow (4).
