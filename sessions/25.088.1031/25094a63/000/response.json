Comparing the changed blocks across examples suggests a selection criterion based on size. Specifically, for each color present in the input (excluding white - 0), the *largest* contiguous rectangular block of that color (by area) seems to be the one targeted for transformation.\n5.  **Modification:** The selected largest rectangular block for each relevant color is entirely filled with yellow (4) in the output grid, replacing its original color. All other pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
