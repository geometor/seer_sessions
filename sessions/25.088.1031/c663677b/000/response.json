Observing the examples, especially the output grids which show the clean pattern, reveals that the pattern repeats every 8 rows and 8 columns. The entire grid seems to be tiled with this 8x8 pattern block.\n3.  **\"Damage\":** The input grids contain patches of white pixels (color 0). These white patches appear to be \"damage\" or missing information laid over the underlying repeating pattern.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The transformation aims to repair the damage. The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that the white pixels (0) are replaced with the color that *should* be at that position according to the underlying 8x8 repeating pattern.\n5.  **Pattern Reconstruction:** The core challenge is to determine the correct 8x8 pattern tile even though parts of it might be obscured by white pixels in any given 8x8 block of the input. By looking at *all* locations in the input grid that correspond to a specific position within the 8x8 tile (e.g., all `(r, c)` where `r % 8 == 0` and `c % 8 == 0`), we can infer the original color for that tile position. The most frequent non-white color across all corresponding input locations appears to be the original color for that position in the pattern tile.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
