grid_properties:
  size: 27x27 (for all training examples)
  colors: Multiple colors used, including white (0) as a special case.

pattern:
  type: Tiling / Repetition
  tile_size: 8x8
  location_rule: The color at grid position (r, c) is determined by the color at position (r % 8, c % 8) in the fundamental 8x8 pattern tile.

input_features:
  background: A repeating 8x8 pattern tile.
  foreground: Patches of white pixels (color 0) overlaying the background pattern. These represent missing or damaged information.

output_features:
  structure: Same dimensions as input.
  content: Identical to the input grid, except white pixels (0) are replaced.

transformation:
  action: Repair / Inpainting / Pattern Completion
  rule: Replace each white pixel (0) in the input grid with the color determined by its position within the 8x8 repeating pattern.
  pattern_determination: The 8x8 pattern tile is determined by finding the most frequent non-white color for each relative position (tr, tc) within the tile, considering all corresponding (r, c) locations in the input grid where r % 8 = tr and c % 8 = tc.
