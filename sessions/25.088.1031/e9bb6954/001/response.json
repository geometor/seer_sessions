Identify all unique non-background (non-zero) colors in the input grid.\n2. For each unique color:\n    a. Find all contiguous objects of that color (pixels are considered contiguous if they touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n    b. Identify the largest object(s) of that color by pixel count. If there's a tie in size, select the one whose top-most, left-most pixel is encountered first in a top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan.\n    c. Determine the bounding box of this representative largest object.\n    d. Calculate the center row and center column of the bounding box using integer division: center_row = floor((min_row + max_row) / 2), center_col = floor((min_col + max_col) / 2).\n3. Create an output grid initialized with the input grid values.\n4. Draw horizontal lines: For each identified color C and its corresponding center row R,\n   fill all cells (R, c) in the output grid with color C if the original input cell input_grid[R, c] was background (0).\n5. Draw vertical lines: For each identified color C and its corresponding center column C_col,\n   fill all cells (r, C_col) in the output grid with color C if the original input cell input_grid[r, C_col] was background (0).\n   This step overwrites any color placed by the horizontal line drawing step at intersection points, provided the original cell at the intersection was background (0).\n\"\"\"\n\n# Helper function to find contiguous objects of a specific color\ndef _find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds all contiguous objects of a given color using BFS.\n       Contiguity includes diagonals.
