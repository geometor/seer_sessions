Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples feature a large grid divided into smaller, equal-sized rectangular regions ("cell blocks") by repeating horizontal and vertical lines of a single dominant color (blue in ex 1, red in ex 2, azure in ex 3). The lines themselves are one pixel thick.
2.  **Background:** The background color within the cell blocks is consistently white (0).
3.  **Pattern Object:** In each input grid, exactly one of these cell blocks contains a small, contiguous pattern made of a third color (green in ex 1, yellow in ex 2, red in ex 3). The pattern's shape and color differ between examples.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the replication of this unique pattern. In the output grid, the pattern found in the single input cell block is copied into *every* cell block defined by the grid lines.
5.  **Consistency:** The grid lines, background color, pattern color, and relative position of the pattern within its block are preserved during the replication.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
      divided: true
      divider_type: grid_lines

  - type: grid_lines
    properties:
      orientation: [horizontal, vertical]
      color: variable (blue(1), red(2), or azure(8) in examples)
      thickness: 1 pixel
      spacing: constant_and_equal (defines cell blocks)
    relationships:
      - divides the main grid into cell_blocks

  - type: cell_blocks
    properties:
      shape: rectangle
      size: uniform (determined by grid_line spacing)
      content: initially white background, one block contains a pattern_object
    relationships:
      - tessellate the area between grid_lines

  - type: pattern_object
    properties:
      color: variable (green(3), yellow(4), or red(2) in examples)
      shape: variable, contiguous
      count_per_input: 1
      location: contained within a single cell_block
    relationships:
      - distinct from background_color and grid_line_color

actions:
  - name: identify_grid_structure
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: [grid_line_color, horizontal_line_rows, vertical_line_cols, cell_block_definitions]

  - name: locate_pattern
    inputs: input_grid, grid_structure_info
    outputs: [pattern_object (shape, color, relative_position), source_cell_block]

  - name: replicate_pattern
    inputs: [input_grid, pattern_object, cell_block_definitions]
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Copy the pattern_object into every cell_block defined by the grid_lines, maintaining its relative position within each block. The grid_lines and background remain unchanged.

goal: Replicate a unique pattern found in one grid cell across all grid cells defined by structural grid lines.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the repeating horizontal and vertical grid lines and their color (the "grid color"). Determine the boundaries (top row, bottom row, left column, right column) of all the rectangular cell blocks formed by these lines.
2.  Scan the input grid to find the single contiguous object (the "pattern") whose color is not white (0) and not the grid color. Record its color, shape (as a set of relative coordinates within its containing cell block), and the boundaries of the cell block it originates from.
3.  Create a new grid identical to the input grid. This will be the output grid.
4.  Iterate through every cell block identified in step 1.
5.  For each cell block in the iteration, overlay the recorded pattern onto the corresponding area in the output grid. Ensure the pattern maintains the same relative position within the target cell block as it had in its original cell block. Update the pixel colors in the output grid accordingly.
6.  Return the modified grid.
