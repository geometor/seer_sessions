task_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
      divided: true
      divider_type: grid_lines

  - type: grid_lines
    properties:
      orientation: [horizontal, vertical]
      color: variable (blue(1), red(2), or azure(8) in examples)
      thickness: 1 pixel
      spacing: constant_and_equal (defines cell blocks)
    relationships:
      - divides the main grid into cell_blocks

  - type: cell_blocks
    properties:
      shape: rectangle
      size: uniform (determined by grid_line spacing)
      content: initially white background, one block contains a pattern_object
    relationships:
      - tessellate the area between grid_lines

  - type: pattern_object
    properties:
      color: variable (green(3), yellow(4), or red(2) in examples)
      shape: variable, contiguous
      count_per_input: 1
      location: contained within a single cell_block
    relationships:
      - distinct from background_color and grid_line_color

actions:
  - name: identify_grid_structure
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: [grid_line_color, horizontal_line_rows, vertical_line_cols, cell_block_definitions]

  - name: locate_pattern
    inputs: input_grid, grid_structure_info
    outputs: [pattern_object (shape, color, relative_position), source_cell_block]

  - name: replicate_pattern
    inputs: [input_grid, pattern_object, cell_block_definitions]
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Copy the pattern_object into every cell_block defined by the grid_lines, maintaining its relative position within each block. The grid_lines and background remain unchanged.

goal: Replicate a unique pattern found in one grid cell across all grid cells defined by structural grid lines.
