The lines themselves are one pixel thick.\n2.  **Background:** The background color within the cell blocks is consistently white (0).\n3.  **Pattern Object:** In each input grid, exactly one of these cell blocks contains a small, contiguous pattern made of a third color (green in ex 1, yellow in ex 2, red in ex 3). The pattern's shape and color differ between examples.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the replication of this unique pattern. In the output grid, the pattern found in the single input cell block is copied into *every* cell block defined by the grid lines.\n5.  **Consistency:** The grid lines, background color, pattern color, and relative position of the pattern within its block are preserved during the replication.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to find the single contiguous object (the \"pattern\") whose color is not white (0) and not the grid color. Record its color, shape (as a set of relative coordinates within its containing cell block), and the boundaries of the cell block it originates from.\n3.  Create a new grid identical to the input grid. This will be the output grid.\n4.  Iterate through every cell block identified in step 1.\n5.  For each cell block in the iteration, overlay the recorded pattern onto the corresponding area in the output grid. Ensure the pattern maintains the same relative position within the target cell block as it had in its original cell block. Update the pixel colors in the output grid accordingly.\n6.
