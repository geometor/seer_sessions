Task: Color filling based on regional context (boundary vs. interior)

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels.
  - Pixels:
    - Color: white (0), blue (1)
  - Objects:
    - Background: Implicit, often white (0).
    - Structure: Contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels.
      - Role: Partitions the grid into areas.
    - Fill_Areas: Contiguous regions of white (0) pixels.
      - Properties: Location (row, col), Size, Shape.
      - Relationships: Bounded by Structure or grid edges.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Pixels:
    - Color: blue (1), red (2), green (3)
  - Objects:
    - Structure: Identical to input structure (blue pixels remain).
    - Filled_Areas: Correspond to input Fill_Areas but with new colors.
      - Color determined by location context.

Transformation:
  - Action: Recolor Fill_Areas (white pixels).
  - Condition: Based on whether a Fill_Area is on the 'boundary' or 'interior' relative to all Fill_Areas.
  - Steps:
    1. Identify all distinct contiguous regions of white (0) pixels (Fill_Areas).
    2. Determine the overall bounding box encompassing all identified Fill_Areas.
    3. Classify each Fill_Area:
       - Boundary_Area: If any pixel of the area lies on the edge of the overall bounding box.
       - Interior_Area: If the area is not a Boundary_Area.
    4. Recolor pixels:
       - Pixels in Boundary_Areas: Change from white (0) to red (2).
       - Pixels in Interior_Areas: Change from white (0) to green (3).
       - Blue (1) pixels remain unchanged.
