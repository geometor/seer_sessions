## General Assessment

The provided Python code successfully identifies rows and columns with at least two blue pixels and draws connecting blue lines. However, the comparison between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` reveals a key misunderstanding: the interaction between the newly drawn blue lines and the existing red pixels (color 2).

The errors consistently show that red pixels located *on the path* of the generated blue lines (between the outermost blue pixels in a qualifying row or column) should be turned blue, but the current code fails to do this. It only overwrites the pixels directly between the two defining blue pixels, leaving other pixels (including red ones) on that line segment unchanged if they weren't originally white.

The strategy is to refine the logic for drawing the lines. Instead of just copying the input and selectively overwriting, the line-drawing process needs to ensure *all* pixels along the calculated segment (horizontal or vertical) are set to blue, regardless of their original color (unless they are the original blue anchor pixels themselves, which are already blue).

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze Example 1 to confirm the hypothesis.
