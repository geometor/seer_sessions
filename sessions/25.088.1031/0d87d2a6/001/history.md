Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Contents**: The grids contain three colors: white (0), blue (1), and red (2).
2.  **Input vs. Output**: The core change involves the blue pixels (1). In the input, blue pixels are often sparse, sometimes appearing as single points. In the output, these blue pixels form connected horizontal and vertical lines or segments.
3.  **Role of Red Pixels**: The red pixels (2) appear as solid blocks or shapes in the input. Comparing input and output, these red blocks *do not* act as barriers to the formation of the blue lines. The blue lines overwrite red pixels if they fall along the path of the line segment. Red pixels outside these generated blue lines remain unchanged.
4.  **Line Formation**:
    *   **Horizontal Lines**: If a row in the input grid contains two or more blue pixels, a horizontal blue line is drawn in the output grid connecting the leftmost blue pixel to the rightmost blue pixel in that row. All cells between them (inclusive) become blue.
    *   **Vertical Lines**: If a column in the input grid contains two or more blue pixels, a vertical blue line is drawn in the output grid connecting the topmost blue pixel to the bottommost blue pixel in that column. All cells between them (inclusive) become blue.
5.  **Overwriting**: The process of drawing these blue lines overwrites any existing pixel color (white or red) along the line's path in the output grid.
6.  **Independence**: The horizontal and vertical line formations seem independent. A pixel can become blue if it's part of a horizontal segment OR a vertical segment OR both.
7.  **Source Pixels**: The locations of the blue pixels in the *input* grid determine where the lines are drawn.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Create horizontal and vertical blue lines connecting the extreme pairs of blue pixels found in each row and column of the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Variable height and width (observed: 20x20, 10x20, 13x14)
  - colors: white (0), blue (1), red (2)

objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0), blue (1), red (2)
      - location: (row, column)
  - type: blue_pixel_grouping
    properties:
      - axis: row or column
      - condition: Contains two or more blue (1) pixels from the input grid.
      - definition_points:
          - row: (row_index, min_col_index), (row_index, max_col_index) of input blue pixels
          - column: (min_row_index, col_index), (max_row_index, col_index) of input blue pixels

actions:
  - action: identify_input_blue_pixels
    description: Find the coordinates of all pixels with value 1 in the input grid.
  - action: draw_horizontal_segments
    description: For each row containing >= 2 input blue pixels, determine the min and max column index (c_min, c_max) of those blue pixels. Fill the corresponding segment [c_min, c_max] in that row of the output grid with blue (1).
  - action: draw_vertical_segments
    description: For each column containing >= 2 input blue pixels, determine the min and max row index (r_min, r_max) of those blue pixels. Fill the corresponding segment [r_min, r_max] in that column of the output grid with blue (1).
  - action: copy_input
    description: Initialize the output grid as a direct copy of the input grid before drawing segments.

relationships:
  - relationship: segment_source
    source: Locations of blue (1) pixels in the *input* grid.
    target: Horizontal and vertical segments drawn in the *output* grid.
  - relationship: overwriting
    element: Blue (1) segments drawn.
    overwrites: Any pre-existing pixel color (white, red, or even original blue) in the output grid along the segment's path.

transformation_logic:
  - The transformation generates blue line segments based on the distribution of blue pixels in the input.
  - Red pixels do not block segment creation; they are overwritten if they lie on a segment path.
  - The final output combines the results of horizontal and vertical segment drawing onto an initial copy of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new grid, initially identical to the input grid (this will be the output grid).
2.  Find the locations (row, column coordinates) of all blue pixels (value 1) present in the *input* grid.
3.  **Process Rows**: Iterate through each row index of the grid.
    a.  Collect all input blue pixel locations that fall within the current row.
    b.  If two or more blue pixels were found in this row:
        i.  Determine the minimum column index (`c_min`) and the maximum column index (`c_max`) among these blue pixels.
        ii. For every column index `c` from `c_min` to `c_max` (inclusive), set the pixel at (current_row, `c`) in the *output* grid to blue (1).
4.  **Process Columns**: Iterate through each column index of the grid.
    a.  Collect all input blue pixel locations that fall within the current column.
    b.  If two or more blue pixels were found in this column:
        i.  Determine the minimum row index (`r_min`) and the maximum row index (`r_max`) among these blue pixels.
        ii. For every row index `r` from `r_min` to `r_max` (inclusive), set the pixel at (`r`, current_column) in the *output* grid to blue (1).
5.  Return the final output grid.
