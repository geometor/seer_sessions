            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Contents**: The grids contain three colors: white (0), blue (1), and red (2).\n2.  **Input vs. Output**: The core change involves the blue pixels (1). In the input, blue pixels are often sparse, sometimes appearing as single points. In the output, these blue pixels form connected horizontal and vertical lines or segments.\n3.  **Role of Red Pixels**: The red pixels (2) appear as solid blocks or shapes in the input. Comparing input and output, these red blocks *do not* act as barriers to the formation of the blue lines. The blue lines overwrite red pixels if they fall along the path of the line segment. Red pixels outside these generated blue lines remain unchanged.\n4.  **Line Formation**:\n    *   **Horizontal Lines**: If a row in the input grid contains two or more blue pixels, a horizontal blue line is drawn in the output grid connecting the leftmost blue pixel to the rightmost blue pixel in that row. All cells between them (inclusive) become blue.\n    *   **Vertical Lines**: If a column in the input grid contains two or more blue pixels, a vertical blue line is drawn in the output grid connecting the topmost blue pixel to the bottommost blue pixel in that column. All cells between them (inclusive) become blue.\n5.  **Overwriting**: The process of drawing these blue lines overwrites any existing pixel color (white or red) along the line's path in the output grid.\n6.  **Independence**: The horizontal and vertical line formations seem independent. A pixel can become blue if it's part of a horizontal segment OR a vertical segment OR both.\n7.  **Source Pixels**: The locations of the blue pixels in the *input* grid determine where the lines are drawn.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
