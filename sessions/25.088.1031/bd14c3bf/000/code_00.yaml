Input_Features:
  - Grids containing distinct objects made of colored pixels (primarily blue 1, red 2) on a white (0) background.
  - Objects can be solid, hollow (frames), lines, or other shapes.
  - Objects can be located anywhere on the grid, potentially touching borders or other objects.

Output_Features:
  - Grids derived from the input grids.
  - Some blue (1) objects from the input are now red (2) in the output.
  - All original red (2) objects remain red (2).
  - All other pixels (white 0, etc.) remain unchanged.

Transformation_Elements:
  - Objects: Focus is on contiguous blocks of blue (1) pixels and red (2) pixels.
  - Properties:
    - `is_blue`: The object's color is blue (1).
    - `encloses_white`: The blue object surrounds one or more white (0) pixels that are not reachable from the grid's exterior without crossing the blue object.
    - `is_adjacent_to_red`: At least one pixel of the blue object shares an edge or corner (8-way adjacency) with a pixel belonging to an original red (2) object.
  - Actions:
    - Identify blue objects.
    - Identify red objects.
    - For each blue object, determine `encloses_white` status.
    - For each blue object, determine `is_adjacent_to_red` status.
    - Change color of a blue object to red based on a specific logical condition involving these properties.

Relationships:
  - The decision to change a blue object's color depends on the combination of its own structure (`encloses_white`) and its spatial relationship (`is_adjacent_to_red`) to existing red objects.
  - Condition for change: (`encloses_white` AND NOT `is_adjacent_to_red`) OR (NOT `encloses_white` AND `is_adjacent_to_red`).
