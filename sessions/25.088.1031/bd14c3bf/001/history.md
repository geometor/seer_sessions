Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are white (0), blue (1), and red (2). Other colors appear but don't seem central to the transformation rule itself.
2.  **Input Structure:** Inputs contain various distinct shapes (objects) made of blue and red pixels, scattered across a white background. Some shapes are solid blocks or lines, while others are hollow frames or more complex forms.
3.  **Output Structure:** Outputs are largely similar to the inputs, but some blue objects have changed their color to red. Original red objects seem to remain unchanged.
4.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation involves selectively changing certain blue (1) objects into red (2) objects. The key is to identify the criteria determining which blue objects undergo this change.
5.  **Object Properties:** Key properties of the blue objects seem to be:
    *   **Shape/Structure:** Whether the object is solid or if it encloses empty (white) space within its structure (like a frame).
    *   **Proximity to Red Objects:** Whether a blue object is touching or near an existing red object.
6.  **Observed Patterns:**
    *   Blue objects that look like hollow frames (enclosing white space) often change to red. (e.g., Ex1 middle-left, Ex2 top-right, Ex3 middle).
    *   However, a hollow blue frame *doesn't* change if it's adjacent to an existing red object (e.g., Ex3 top-right).
    *   Solid blue objects usually remain blue (e.g., Ex1 bottom-left, Ex2 middle-right, Ex3 middle-center).
    *   However, some solid blue objects (lines in Ex2) *do* change to red, and these happen to be adjacent to an existing red object.
    *   Existing red objects never change color.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
Input_Features:
  - Grids containing distinct objects made of colored pixels (primarily blue 1, red 2) on a white (0) background.
  - Objects can be solid, hollow (frames), lines, or other shapes.
  - Objects can be located anywhere on the grid, potentially touching borders or other objects.

Output_Features:
  - Grids derived from the input grids.
  - Some blue (1) objects from the input are now red (2) in the output.
  - All original red (2) objects remain red (2).
  - All other pixels (white 0, etc.) remain unchanged.

Transformation_Elements:
  - Objects: Focus is on contiguous blocks of blue (1) pixels and red (2) pixels.
  - Properties:
    - `is_blue`: The object's color is blue (1).
    - `encloses_white`: The blue object surrounds one or more white (0) pixels that are not reachable from the grid's exterior without crossing the blue object.
    - `is_adjacent_to_red`: At least one pixel of the blue object shares an edge or corner (8-way adjacency) with a pixel belonging to an original red (2) object.
  - Actions:
    - Identify blue objects.
    - Identify red objects.
    - For each blue object, determine `encloses_white` status.
    - For each blue object, determine `is_adjacent_to_red` status.
    - Change color of a blue object to red based on a specific logical condition involving these properties.

Relationships:
  - The decision to change a blue object's color depends on the combination of its own structure (`encloses_white`) and its spatial relationship (`is_adjacent_to_red`) to existing red objects.
  - Condition for change: (`encloses_white` AND NOT `is_adjacent_to_red`) OR (NOT `encloses_white` AND `is_adjacent_to_red`).

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
3.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of red (2) pixels in the input grid. Store the locations of all pixels belonging to these red objects.
4.  For each identified blue object:
    a.  Determine if the blue object encloses any white (0) pixels. This can be checked by performing a flood fill starting from all white pixels on the grid border; any white pixel within the blue object's bounding box that remains unvisited by the flood fill is considered enclosed. Set a flag `encloses_white` accordingly.
    b.  Determine if any pixel belonging to the current blue object is adjacent (sharing an edge or corner, 8-way connectivity) to any pixel belonging to *any* of the original red objects identified in step 3. Set a flag `is_adjacent_to_red` accordingly.
    c.  Evaluate the condition: (`encloses_white` is true AND `is_adjacent_to_red` is false) OR (`encloses_white` is false AND `is_adjacent_to_red` is true).
    d.  If the condition in step 4c is true, change the color of all pixels belonging to this blue object from blue (1) to red (2) in the output grid.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
