Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are relatively large and sparse, consisting mostly of a white background (color 0) with scattered pixels of various colors.
2.  **Key Element - Azure Pixels (8):** In all examples, there are multiple azure-colored pixels (color 8). These pixels often form shapes or distinct clusters (squares, L-shapes). They appear to be crucial markers.
3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids maintain the original size and keep all the non-white pixels from the input in their original positions.
4.  **The Transformation:** The primary change is the appearance of a filled vertical band or region. This band spans the entire height of the grid. The columns covered by this band seem related to the positions of the azure (8) pixels in the input.
5.  **Fill Color:** The color used for the fill varies between examples (orange=7, blue=1, green=3). This fill color is always present somewhere in the input grid, distinct from the azure color.
6.  **Fill Logic:** The fill only changes white (0) pixels within the designated vertical band to the fill color. Existing non-white pixels within this band (including the original azure pixels) are preserved.
7.  **Determining Fill Area:** The horizontal extent (columns) of the filled band appears directly related to the minimum and maximum column indices of the azure (8) pixels. Specifically, the fill seems to start at the minimum column containing an azure pixel and extend one column beyond the maximum column containing an azure pixel.
8.  **Determining Fill Color:** The color used for filling the band seems to be determined by finding which *other* non-white color has at least one pixel located within the bounding box defined by the azure pixels. In all examples, only one such color exists within the azure bounding box's row and column limits.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9. Contains a background and scattered colored pixels.
  - object: background_pixel
    color: 0 (white)
    role: The default state, potentially modified in the output.
  - object: colored_pixel
    color: 1-9 (excluding 8)
    role: Scattered pixels that might determine the fill color or be preserved in the output.
  - object: azure_pixel
    color: 8 (azure)
    role: Act as markers defining a bounding box (min/max row/column). Their extent determines the columns to be filled.
  - object: fill_area
    description: A vertical band spanning the full height of the grid in the output.
    properties:
      columns: Determined by the min_col and max_col+1 of the azure_pixels' bounding box.
      rows: Spans all rows of the grid.
      fill_color: Determined by the non-white, non-azure color found within the azure_pixels' bounding box.
      content: Replaces background_pixels within its boundaries with the fill_color, preserves original colored_pixels and azure_pixels.

actions:
  - action: find_azure_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates of all azure (8) pixels.
  - action: calculate_azure_bounding_box
    input: coordinates of azure pixels
    output: min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col
  - action: determine_fill_columns
    input: min_col, max_col from azure bounding box
    output: range of columns from min_col to max_col + 1.
  - action: find_fill_color
    input: input_grid, azure bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)
    output: The color C (not 0 and not 8) found at coordinates (r, c) such that min_r <= r <= max_r and min_c <= c <= max_c. Assume only one such color exists.
  - action: apply_fill
    input: input_grid, fill_columns, fill_color
    output: output_grid
    process: Create a copy of the input grid. Iterate through all rows. For each row, iterate through the fill_columns. If the pixel at (row, col) in the input grid is white (0), change it to the fill_color in the output grid copy. Otherwise, keep the original pixel color.

relationships:
  - The columns of the fill_area are derived directly from the horizontal extent (min/max columns) of the azure_pixels.
  - The fill_color is determined by searching for a specific colored_pixel within the spatial bounds defined by the azure_pixels.
  - The fill operation preserves all pre-existing non-background information within the fill_area.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find the coordinates of all pixels with the azure color (8).
3.  If no azure pixels are found, return the original input grid (or handle as an edge case, though examples suggest they are always present).
4.  Determine the minimum and maximum row indices (`min_r`, `max_r`) and minimum and maximum column indices (`min_c`, `max_c`) occupied by the azure pixels. This defines the azure bounding box.
5.  Identify the range of columns to be filled in the output grid: from `min_c` up to and including `max_c + 1`.
6.  Determine the fill color: Iterate through all pixels within the azure bounding box (rows `min_r` to `max_r`, columns `min_c` to `max_c`) in the input grid. Find the color (`fill_color`) of the first pixel encountered that is *not* white (0) and *not* azure (8). (The examples suggest there will be exactly one such color within this box).
7.  Iterate through each row of the grid (from row 0 to the last row).
8.  For each row, iterate through the determined range of fill columns (`min_c` to `max_c + 1`).
9.  At each cell (`row`, `col`) within this fill range, check the color in the *original input grid*. If the color is white (0), update the corresponding cell in the *output grid* to the `fill_color`.
10. Return the modified output grid.
