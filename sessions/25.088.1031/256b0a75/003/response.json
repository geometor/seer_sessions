If no azure pixels exist, return the input grid unchanged.\n2.  Determine the bounding box encompassing all azure pixels: find the minimum and maximum row indices (min_r, max_r) and minimum and maximum column indices (min_c, max_c).\n3.  Determine the vertical fill band: this band includes all columns from min_c up to and including max_c.\n4.  Find the fill color: \n    a. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) within the azure bounding box (rows min_r to max_r, columns min_c to max_c), searching row by row, then column by column.\n    b. For each pixel (r, c), check if its color is neither white (0) nor azure (8).\n    c. If it's a potential fill color candidate, check if this pixel (r, c) is adjacent (including diagonals) to any azure (8) pixel in the *entire input grid*.\n    d. The fill color is the color of the *first* pixel found that satisfies both conditions (not white/azure AND not adjacent to azure).\n5.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n6.  Iterate through each row of the grid. For each row, iterate through the columns within the determined fill band (from min_c to max_c, inclusive).\n7.  If the pixel at the current (row, column) in the *input* grid is white (0), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to the determined fill_color. Otherwise, keep the original color from the input grid.\n8.  Return the modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_azure_coords(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the coordinates of all azure (8) pixels and their bounding box.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = np.where(grid == 8)\n    if len(rows) == 0:\n        return None, None, None, None, None # Added None for azure_locations\n    min_r, max_r = np.min(rows), np.max(rows)\n    min_c, max_c = np.min(cols), np.max(cols)\n    azure_locations = set(zip(rows, cols))\n    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c, azure_locations\n\ndef is_adjacent_to_azure(grid, r, c, height, width):\n    \"\"\"Checks if the pixel at (r, c) is adjacent (including diagonals) to any azure pixel.\"\"\"\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue # Skip self\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            # Check boundary conditions\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                if grid[nr, nc] == 8:\n                    return True\n    return False\n\ndef find_fill_color(grid, min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c, height, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first non-white, non-azure color within the specified bounding box\n    that is NOT adjacent to any azure pixel in the grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):\n        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):\n            color = grid[r, c]\n            # Condition b: Check if color is potential candidate\n            if color != 0 and color != 8:\n                # Condition c: Check adjacency\n                if not is_adjacent_to_azure(grid, r, c, height, width):\n                    return color # Found the fill color\n    # Fallback if no suitable color found (shouldn't happen based on examples)\n    # If it does happen, maybe return the first non-white/non-azure in box?\n    # Let's stick to the derived rule for now.
