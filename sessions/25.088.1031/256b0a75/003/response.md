Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1.  Identify all pixels with the azure color (8) in the input grid. If no azure pixels exist, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  Determine the bounding box encompassing all azure pixels: find the minimum and maximum row indices (min_r, max_r) and minimum and maximum column indices (min_c, max_c).
3.  Determine the vertical fill band: this band includes all columns from min_c up to and including max_c.
4.  Find the fill color: 
    a. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) within the azure bounding box (rows min_r to max_r, columns min_c to max_c), searching row by row, then column by column.
    b. For each pixel (r, c), check if its color is neither white (0) nor azure (8).
    c. If it's a potential fill color candidate, check if this pixel (r, c) is adjacent (including diagonals) to any azure (8) pixel in the *entire input grid*.
    d. The fill color is the color of the *first* pixel found that satisfies both conditions (not white/azure AND not adjacent to azure).
5.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
6.  Iterate through each row of the grid. For each row, iterate through the columns within the determined fill band (from min_c to max_c, inclusive).
7.  If the pixel at the current (row, column) in the *input* grid is white (0), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to the determined fill_color. Otherwise, keep the original color from the input grid.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
