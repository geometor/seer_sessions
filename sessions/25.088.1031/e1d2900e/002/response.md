## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified the core action: changing white (0) pixels adjacent to red (2) pixels to blue (1). However, it failed because it applied this rule too broadly. Comparing the `Transformed Output` with the `Expected Output` across the examples reveals that not *all* white pixels adjacent to red pixels are changed. The presence of original blue (1) pixels in the input appears to constrain the transformation.

The pattern suggests a "fill" or "connectivity" concept. It seems that a white pixel only changes to blue if it is adjacent to a red pixel *and* it is part of a contiguous region of white pixels that also touches at least one *original* blue pixel. In essence, the original blue pixels act as starting points for defining regions where the red pixels' influence can spread (by one step) onto adjacent white pixels.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Identify Fillable Regions:** Determine all white pixels (0) that are connected (orthogonally) to any original blue pixel (1) through paths consisting only of white pixels. Standard graph traversal algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Flood Fill can be used, starting from all original blue pixels and exploring adjacent white pixels.
2.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Find all white pixels (0) that are orthogonally adjacent to any red pixel (2).
3.  **Apply Transformation:** Change a white pixel to blue (1) in the output *only if* it meets both conditions: it is adjacent to a red pixel *and* it belongs to the "fillable region" identified in step 1.
4.  **Copy Others:** All other pixels (original red, original blue, white pixels not meeting both conditions) remain unchanged.

## Metrics

Let's gather some metrics using code execution to verify assumptions about connectivity and adjacency.
