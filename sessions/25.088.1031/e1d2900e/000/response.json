In the output grids, additional blue pixels appear specifically adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) to the red objects.\n4.  **Consistency:** The original blue pixels and the red objects remain unchanged in their positions and colors from input to output. The transformation only adds new blue pixels.\n5.  **Rule:** It seems the rule is to identify all white pixels (color 0) that are directly adjacent (sharing an edge) to any red pixel (color 2) and change those white pixels to blue (color 1).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
