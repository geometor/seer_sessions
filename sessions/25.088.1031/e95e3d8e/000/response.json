            "text": "**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Size:** The input and output grids consistently have the same dimensions in each example pair (22x22).\n2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use a variety of colors (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange). White (0) plays a special role.\n3.  **Pattern Recognition:** The non-white pixels in the input grids form repeating patterns, but these patterns are interrupted or corrupted by blocks or scattered white (0) pixels.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output grids exhibit perfect, uninterrupted repeating patterns (tiling). The white pixels from the input are gone.\n5.  **Transformation Goal:** The core transformation appears to be identifying the underlying repeating pattern (the \"tile\") in the input grid, ignoring the white pixel corruptions, and then reconstructing the entire grid using this perfect tile.\n6.  **Tile Identification:** The size (height H, width W) and the content of the repeating tile can be inferred from the input grid by analyzing the repeating sequences of non-white pixels both horizontally and vertically.\n    *   Example 1: 5x5 tile.\n    *   Example 2: 3x3 tile.\n    *   Example 3: 7x7 tile.\n7.  **Pattern Restoration:** The color for each position `(r, c)` within the fundamental tile seems to be determined by finding the most frequent non-white color among all corresponding positions `(r + k*H, c + l*W)` in the input grid.\n8.  **Output Generation:** The output grid is filled by repeating the identified HxW tile across its entire area. The color at output coordinate `(R, C)` is determined by the tile color at `(R % H, C % W)`.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
