**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Size:** The input and output grids consistently have the same dimensions in each example pair (22x22).
2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use a variety of colors (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange). White (0) plays a special role.
3.  **Pattern Recognition:** The non-white pixels in the input grids form repeating patterns, but these patterns are interrupted or corrupted by blocks or scattered white (0) pixels.
4.  **Output Structure:** The output grids exhibit perfect, uninterrupted repeating patterns (tiling). The white pixels from the input are gone.
5.  **Transformation Goal:** The core transformation appears to be identifying the underlying repeating pattern (the "tile") in the input grid, ignoring the white pixel corruptions, and then reconstructing the entire grid using this perfect tile.
6.  **Tile Identification:** The size (height H, width W) and the content of the repeating tile can be inferred from the input grid by analyzing the repeating sequences of non-white pixels both horizontally and vertically.
    *   Example 1: 5x5 tile.
    *   Example 2: 3x3 tile.
    *   Example 3: 7x7 tile.
7.  **Pattern Restoration:** The color for each position `(r, c)` within the fundamental tile seems to be determined by finding the most frequent non-white color among all corresponding positions `(r + k*H, c + l*W)` in the input grid.
8.  **Output Generation:** The output grid is filled by repeating the identified HxW tile across its entire area. The color at output coordinate `(R, C)` is determined by the tile color at `(R % H, C % W)`.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Determine the dimensions (Height `H_tile`, Width `W_tile`) of the repeating tile pattern within the input grid by analyzing the periodic repetition of non-white pixel sequences horizontally and vertically. Find the smallest `H_tile > 0` and `W_tile > 0` that define this repetition.
3.  Create a new grid, `tile_grid`, of size `H_tile` x `W_tile` to store the pattern of the fundamental tile.
4.  For each cell `(tr, tc)` in the `tile_grid` (where `0 <= tr < H_tile` and `0 <= tc < W_tile`):
    a.  Identify all cells `(R, C)` in the input grid such that `R % H_tile == tr` and `C % W_tile == tc`.
    b.  Collect the colors of these identified input grid cells.
    c.  Filter out any white (0) colors from the collected colors.
    d.  Determine the most frequent color among the remaining non-white colors.
    e.  Assign this most frequent non-white color to the cell `(tr, tc)` in the `tile_grid`.
5.  Create the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
6.  Fill the output grid by tiling the `tile_grid`. For each cell `(R, C)` in the output grid, set its color to the color found at `tile_grid[R % H_tile, C % W_tile]`.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
