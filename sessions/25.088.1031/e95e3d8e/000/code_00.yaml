elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - contains pixels with colors 0-9
      - has dimensions H_grid x W_grid
  - type: pattern
    properties:
      - is a rectangular tile of size H_tile x W_tile
      - repeats horizontally and vertically within the grid
  - type: corruption
    properties:
      - represented by white pixels (color 0)
      - disrupts the repeating pattern in the input grid
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    contains:
      - pattern: partially obscured by corruption
      - corruption: white pixels
  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions match input_grid
    contains:
      - pattern: perfectly tiled across the grid
relationships:
  - type: derivation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: The output grid is derived by identifying the underlying pattern in the input grid and removing the corruptions by perfectly tiling the pattern.
actions:
  - action: identify_tile_dimensions
    input: input_grid
    output: H_tile, W_tile
    description: Analyze horizontal and vertical repetitions of non-white pixel sequences to find the smallest repeating unit dimensions.
  - action: determine_tile_content
    input: input_grid, H_tile, W_tile
    output: tile_grid (H_tile x W_tile)
    description: For each cell (tr, tc) in the tile, find the most frequent non-white color among all corresponding cells (R, C) in the input grid where R % H_tile == tr and C % W_tile == tc.
  - action: generate_output
    input: tile_grid, H_grid, W_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Create a grid of size H_grid x W_grid by tiling the tile_grid. The color at (R, C) is tile_grid[R % H_tile, C % W_tile].
