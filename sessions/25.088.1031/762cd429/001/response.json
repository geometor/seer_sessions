Let the top row of this block be r0 and the colors\nbe C_tl, C_tr, C_bl, C_br corresponding to the top-left, top-right, bottom-left,\nand bottom-right cells of the 2x2 block, respectively.\n\nThe output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. It is filled with\ncolors based on four quadrants defined relative to the input block's position\nand the grid's width. The filling excludes the first two columns (columns 0 and 1).\n\nThe horizontal division line for the quadrants is defined by the row r0 found\nearlier. Rows above r0 (index < r0) belong to the top quadrants, and rows at or\nbelow r0 (index >= r0) belong to the bottom quadrants.\n\nThe vertical division line is defined by the middle column index, calculated as\nW // 2, where W is the width of the grid. Columns to the left of this middle\nindex (index < W // 2) belong to the left quadrants, and columns at or to the\nright (index >= W // 2) belong to the right quadrants.\n\nStarting from column 2 up to the last column (W-1):\n- The top-left quadrant (row < r0, col < W // 2) is filled with C_tl.\n- The top-right quadrant (row < r0, col >= W // 2) is filled with C_tr.\n- The bottom-left quadrant (row >= r0, col < W // 2) is filled with C_bl.\n- The bottom-right quadrant (row >= r0, col >= W // 2) is filled with C_br.\n\nColumns 0 and 1 remain white (0).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_pattern_top_row(grid_arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the top row index (r0) of the 2x2 pattern.\n    Assumes the pattern starts in column 0 and is the first non-white pixel\n    encountered in that column.\n    \"\"\"\n    H, W = grid_arr.shape\n    for r in range(H):\n        if grid_arr[r, 0] != 0:\n            # Basic check ensures the full 2x2 block exists, though examples are consistent\n            if r + 1 < H and W > 1 and grid_arr[r, 1] != 0 and \\\n               grid_arr[r+1, 0] != 0 and grid_arr[r+1, 1] != 0:\n                 return r\n    # Fallback if the strict 2x2 isn't found but a non-zero exists at [r, 0]\n    # (adapting to potential variations not seen in examples)\n    for r in range(H):\n        if grid_arr[r, 0] != 0:\n            return r\n    return -1 # Indicate pattern not found as expected\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by expanding a 2x2 pattern into four colored\n    quadrants in the output grid, excluding the first two columns.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for efficient processing\n    input_arr = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    H, W = input_arr.shape\n\n    # Find the top row (r0) of the 2x2 pattern\n    r0 = find_pattern_top_row(input_arr)\n\n    # If the pattern isn't found in the expected location, return the input unchanged\n    # or handle as an error.
