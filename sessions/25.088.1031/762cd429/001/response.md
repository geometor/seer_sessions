"""
The transformation identifies a 2x2 block of non-white pixels in the bottom-left
region of the input grid. Let the top row of this block be r0 and the colors
be C_tl, C_tr, C_bl, C_br corresponding to the top-left, top-right, bottom-left,
and bottom-right cells of the 2x2 block, respectively.

The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. It is filled with
colors based on four quadrants defined relative to the input block's position
and the grid's width. The filling excludes the first two columns (columns 0 and 1).

The horizontal division line for the quadrants is defined by the row r0 found
earlier. Rows above r0 (index < r0) belong to the top quadrants, and rows at or
below r0 (index >= r0) belong to the bottom quadrants.

The vertical division line is defined by the middle column index, calculated as
W // 2, where W is the width of the grid. Columns to the left of this middle
index (index < W // 2) belong to the left quadrants, and columns at or to the
right (index >= W // 2) belong to the right quadrants.

Starting from column 2 up to the last column (W-1):
- The top-left quadrant (row < r0, col < W // 2) is filled with C_tl.
- The top-right quadrant (row < r0, col >= W // 2) is filled with C_tr.
- The bottom-left quadrant (row >= r0, col < W // 2) is filled with C_bl.
- The bottom-right quadrant (row >= r0, col >= W // 2) is filled with C_br.

Columns 0 and 1 remain white (0).
