task_elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The predominant color of the grid canvas.
  - element: placeholder_shapes
    color: gray (5)
    description: Identical shapes (resembling '8's) arranged in a grid structure. They mark locations for recoloring.
    properties:
      - shape: consistent (3x3 pixel '8')
      - arrangement: grid-like (rows and columns)
  - element: color_key
    description: A distinct rectangular block of non-white, non-gray colors. Acts as a mapping reference.
    properties:
      - location: typically separate from placeholder shapes (e.g., bottom-left).
      - content: contains various colors (e.g., red, blue, green, azure, yellow).
      - dimensions: Its grid dimensions (rows, columns) correspond to the arrangement of placeholder shapes.
actions:
  - action: identify_placeholders
    input: input_grid
    output: locations and boundaries of all gray shapes.
  - action: identify_color_key
    input: input_grid
    output: location, dimensions, and color content of the key block.
  - action: map_key_to_placeholders
    description: Establish a 1:1 correspondence between key cells and placeholder shapes based on their relative grid positions.
  - action: recolor_placeholders
    input: placeholder shapes, mapped key colors
    output: colored shapes (same shape, new color).
  - action: copy_key
    input: color_key from input_grid
    output: color_key placed in the same location in output_grid.
relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: color_key cell at (row_k, col_k)
    to: placeholder shape at (row_p, col_p)
    rule: The relative position (row_k, col_k) within the key grid corresponds to the relative position (row_p, col_p) of the placeholder shape within its arrangement grid. The color value at (row_k, col_k) dictates the output color for the shape at (row_p, col_p).
transformation_goal: Replace each gray placeholder shape with a shape of the same form but colored according to the spatially corresponding cell in the color key, while preserving the color key itself in the output.
