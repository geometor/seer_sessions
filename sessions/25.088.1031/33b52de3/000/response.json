            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain two distinct visual components against a white background (color 0):\n    *   A grid-like arrangement of identical gray (color 5) shapes. These shapes resemble the digit '8' formed by a 3x3 block of pixels.\n    *   A smaller, rectangular block of various colors (not white or gray) located separately, typically towards the bottom-left. This block acts as a 'color key' or 'palette'.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids maintain the overall dimensions and the location of the 'color key' from the input. The key difference is that the gray shapes in the input are replaced by identically shaped objects, but colored according to the 'color key'.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves using the color key to determine the color for each corresponding gray shape in the main grid. The spatial arrangement of colors in the key directly maps to the spatial arrangement of the shapes. For instance, the color in the top-left cell of the key determines the color of the top-left gray shape in the output.\n4.  **Key Preservation:** The color key pattern itself is copied verbatim from the input to the output grid in the same position.\n5.  **Shape Preservation:** The shape of the gray objects ('8's) is preserved; only their color changes.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Identify all connected components (objects) consisting solely of the gray color (5). These are the 'placeholder shapes'. Determine their bounding boxes or locations.\n3.  Identify the rectangular region containing colors other than white (0) and gray (5). This is the 'color key'. Determine its top-left corner, dimensions (height, width), and the color of each cell within it.\n4.  Determine the grid arrangement of the placeholder shapes (how many rows and columns of shapes). This arrangement should match the dimensions of the color key.\n5.  Iterate through the placeholder shapes based on their grid arrangement (e.g., row by row, column by column).\n6.  For each placeholder shape at relative position (row_p, col_p) in the arrangement grid:\n    a.  Find the corresponding color in the color key at the same relative position (row_p, col_p).
