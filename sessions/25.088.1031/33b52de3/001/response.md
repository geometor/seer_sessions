"""
Identifies a grid of placeholder shapes (gray '8's) and a separate color key grid.
Replaces each placeholder shape with the color found at the corresponding position in the color key grid.
Preserves the color key in its original position in the output.

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Find all connected components (objects) of the gray color (5). These are the placeholders.
3. Identify the bounding box and content of the color key by finding all pixels that are not white (0) and not gray (5).
4. Determine the grid arrangement of the placeholder shapes by sorting their top-left coordinates.
5. Map each placeholder shape to a cell in the color key based on their relative grid positions.
6. Recolor the pixels of each placeholder shape in the output grid using the mapped color from the key.
7. Return the modified output grid.
