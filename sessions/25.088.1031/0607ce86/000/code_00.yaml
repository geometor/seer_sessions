task_context:
  description: Clean up noise and restore corrupted patterns in a grid.
  background_color: 0 (white)
  noise_color: 3 (green)
  action_primary: pattern_restoration
  action_secondary: noise_removal

grid_elements:
  - type: background
    color: 0 (white)
    role: Empty space

  - type: pattern
    description: Repeating non-background shapes composed of multiple colors. May appear multiple times in the input.
    properties:
      - size: Varies (e.g., 6x6 in train_1, 6x5 in train_2, 5x4 in train_3 - dimensions based on core colored area)
      - colors: Multiple non-background colors, potentially including green (3).
      - structure: Specific spatial arrangement of colors defining the "ideal" form.
    state_in_input: Can be "ideal" or "corrupted".
    state_in_output: Always "ideal".

  - type: corruption_pixel
    color: 3 (green)
    location: Within a pattern instance, replacing the expected color for that position.
    role: Element to be replaced during restoration.

  - type: noise_pixel
    color: 3 (green)
    location: Outside of any pattern instance, often isolated or in small clusters.
    role: Element to be removed (replaced with background).

transformation:
  - step: Identify repeating non-background patterns and their locations.
  - step: Determine the "ideal" structure for each pattern type by finding the most frequent color at each relative position across all identified instances.
  - step: Create an output grid initialized with the background color.
  - step: For each location where a pattern instance was identified in the input, draw the corresponding "ideal" pattern onto the output grid.
  - result: Output grid contains only ideal patterns on a clean background; noise and corruption green pixels are eliminated or corrected.
