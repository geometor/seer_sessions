*   **Perception:** The task involves modifying an input grid based on specific "seed" pixels found within enclosed blue shapes. The grid contains a white background (0), blue shapes (1), and occasional single pixels of other colors (red=2, green=3, yellow=4, magenta=6) located within or adjacent to the blue shapes. These non-blue, non-white pixels act as seeds. The transformation involves filling connected areas of blue pixels adjacent to a seed pixel with the color of that seed pixel. The fill seems to propagate through contiguous blue pixels (using 4-way adjacency) starting from the neighbors of the seed, stopping when a non-blue pixel (like the white background or another seed pixel) is encountered. The overall structure of the blue shapes and the background remains, but parts of the blue regions change color based on the adjacent seed.

*   **Facts:**

        properties:
          - color: blue (1)
          - composed_of: contiguous pixels
          - function: potentially enclose areas or seed_pixels
      - object: seed_pixel
        properties:
          - color: non-white (0), non-blue (1) (e.g., red(2), green(3), yellow(4), magenta(6))
          - count: usually one per enclosed region
          - location: within or adjacent to blue shapes
    actions:
      - action: find
        actor: system
        target: seed_pixels
        details: Identify pixels with color not equal to 0 or 1.
      - action: flood_fill
        actor: system
        target: blue (1) pixels
        details: For each seed pixel S with color C, initiate a flood fill.
        constraints:
          - Fill starts from blue pixels adjacent (4-way) to S.
          - Fill propagates only to adjacent blue (1) pixels.
          - Fill stops at non-blue pixels.
      - action: change_color
        actor: system
        target: blue (1) pixels visited by flood_fill
        details: Change the color of visited blue pixels to the color C of the corresponding seed pixel S.
    relationships:
      - relationship: adjacency
        between: seed_pixel, blue_pixels
        details: A seed pixel triggers filling in adjacent blue pixels.
      - relationship: connectivity
        between: blue_pixels
        details: The fill propagates through connected blue pixels.
      - relationship: boundary
        between: fill_area, non_blue_pixels
        details: The flood fill is bounded by pixels that are not blue in the original input grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify all "seed" pixels in the input grid, defined as pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor blue (1). Record their locations (row, column) and colors.
    3.  Create a list to store the results of the flood fills, specifically which pixels should change to which color.
    4.  For each identified seed pixel S at position (sr, sc) with color C:
        a.  Initialize a queue for a Breadth-First Search (BFS) flood fill.
        b.  Initialize a set `visited_for_this_seed` to keep track of coordinates visited during the fill originating from this specific seed S. Add the seed's coordinates (sr, sc) to `visited_for_this_seed` to prevent refilling from the seed itself.
        c.  Find all 4-directionally adjacent neighbors (nr, nc) of the seed pixel (sr, sc).
        d.  For each neighbor (nr, nc):
            i.  If the neighbor is within the grid boundaries AND its color in the input grid is blue (1) AND it hasn't been visited for this seed:
                *   Record that the pixel at (nr, nc) should be changed to color C.
                *   Add (nr, nc) to the queue.
                *   Add (nr, nc) to `visited_for_this_seed`.
        e.  While the queue is not empty:
            i.  Dequeue a coordinate (curr_r, curr_c).
            ii. Explore its 4-directionally adjacent neighbors (nr, nc).
            iii. For each neighbor (nr, nc):
                *   If the neighbor is within the grid boundaries AND its color in the input grid is blue (1) AND it hasn't been visited for this seed:
                    *   Record that the pixel at (nr, nc) should be changed to color C.
                    *   Add (nr, nc) to the queue.
                    *   Add (nr, nc) to `visited_for_this_seed`.
    5.  After processing all seeds, apply the recorded color changes to the output grid. Iterate through the recorded changes (pixel coordinate and target color C) and update the corresponding pixel in the output grid to color C.
    6.  Return the final output grid.
