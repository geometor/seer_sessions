The grid contains a white background (0), blue shapes (1), and occasional single pixels of other colors (red=2, green=3, yellow=4, magenta=6) located within or adjacent to the blue shapes. These non-blue, non-white pixels act as seeds. The transformation involves filling connected areas of blue pixels adjacent to a seed pixel with the color of that seed pixel. The fill seems to propagate through contiguous blue pixels (using 4-way adjacency) starting from the neighbors of the seed, stopping when a non-blue pixel (like the white background or another seed pixel) is encountered. The overall structure of the blue shapes and the background remains, but parts of the blue regions change color based on the adjacent seed.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Identify all \"seed\" pixels in the input grid, defined as pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor blue (1). Record their locations (row, column) and colors.\n    3.  Create a list to store the results of the flood fills, specifically which pixels should change to which color.\n    4.  For each identified seed pixel S at position (sr, sc) with color C:\n        a.  Initialize a queue for a Breadth-First Search (BFS) flood fill.\n        b.  Initialize a set `visited_for_this_seed` to keep track of coordinates visited during the fill originating from this specific seed S. Add the seed's coordinates (sr, sc) to `visited_for_this_seed` to prevent refilling from the seed itself.\n        c.  Find all 4-directionally adjacent neighbors (nr, nc) of the seed pixel (sr, sc).\n        d.  For each neighbor (nr, nc):\n            i.  If the neighbor is within the grid boundaries AND its color in the input grid is blue (1) AND it hasn't been visited for this seed:\n                *   Record that the pixel at (nr, nc) should be changed to color C.\n                *   Add (nr, nc) to the queue.\n                *   Add (nr, nc) to `visited_for_this_seed`.\n        e.  While the queue is not empty:\n            i.  Dequeue a coordinate (curr_r, curr_c).\n            ii. Explore its 4-directionally adjacent neighbors (nr, nc).\n            iii. For each neighbor (nr, nc):\n                *   If the neighbor is within the grid boundaries AND its color in the input grid is blue (1) AND it hasn't been visited for this seed:\n                    *   Record that the pixel at (nr, nc) should be changed to color C.\n                    *   Add (nr, nc) to the queue.\n                    *   Add (nr, nc) to `visited_for_this_seed`.\n    5.  After processing all seeds, apply the recorded color changes to the output grid. Iterate through the recorded changes (pixel coordinate and target color C) and update the corresponding pixel in the output grid to color C.\n    6.  Return the final output grid."
