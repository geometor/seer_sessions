task_description: "Color contiguous blue regions adjacent to non-background, non-blue 'seed' pixels with the seed's color."

definitions:
  - name: background_pixel
    description: "A pixel with color white (0)."
  - name: primary_shape_pixel
    description: "A pixel with color blue (1). These pixels form regions."
  - name: seed_pixel
    description: "A pixel whose color is neither white (0) nor blue (1). Each seed has a specific color."
  - name: adjacent
    description: "Sharing an edge (not just a corner). Uses 4-way connectivity."
  - name: contiguous_blue_region
    description: "A set of one or more blue pixels where each pixel is adjacent to at least one other pixel in the set, forming a single connected component."

observations:
  - "The input grid contains a background (white), primary shapes (blue), and seed pixels (other colors)."
  - "The output grid is derived from the input grid."
  - "Background pixels remain unchanged."
  - "Seed pixels remain unchanged in their original positions and colors."
  - "Some blue pixels change color in the output; others remain blue."
  - "A blue pixel changes color only if it belongs to a contiguous blue region that is directly adjacent to a seed pixel."
  - "If a blue pixel changes color, its new color becomes the color of the adjacent seed pixel."
  - "All blue pixels within the same contiguous blue region that is adjacent to a specific seed pixel change to that seed's color."
  - "Blue pixels belonging to a contiguous blue region that is *not* adjacent to any seed pixel remain blue."
  - "If a single contiguous blue region is adjacent to multiple different seeds, the examples do not clearly show how conflicts are resolved (though none are observed in the training data)." # Assuming fill propagates from one seed per region for now.

actions:
  - action: identify_seeds
    description: "Find all pixels in the input grid that are not white (0) and not blue (1)."
  - action: identify_adjacent_blue_regions
    description: "For each seed pixel, find all distinct contiguous blue regions that contain at least one blue pixel directly adjacent to the seed."
  - action: color_regions
    description: "For each identified adjacent blue region, change the color of *all* pixels within that region to the color of the corresponding seed pixel."
  - action: copy_unaffected_pixels
    description: "Ensure all background pixels, seed pixels, and blue pixels not part of an adjacent region identified in the previous steps retain their original color from the input grid."

output_grid_composition:
  - "Original background pixels."
  - "Original seed pixels."
  - "Original blue pixels that were not part of a contiguous blue region adjacent to any seed."
  - "Blue pixels that were part of a contiguous blue region adjacent to a seed, now colored with that seed's color."
