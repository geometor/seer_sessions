            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code implemented a flood fill originating from the blue neighbors of each seed pixel. The results show that this approach incorrectly colors *all* reachable blue pixels connected to those initial neighbors, often extending far beyond the intended area and overwriting blue pixels that should remain blue.\n\nThe `Expected Output` in each example suggests a more localized effect: only the contiguous blue region(s) *directly adjacent* to a seed pixel are filled with that seed's color. Blue pixels belonging to regions not touching a seed, or blue pixels within a touching region but perhaps separated by a non-blue pixel (though this separation isn't explicitly shown in these examples, the fill clearly stops), remain blue.\n\nThe strategy needs to be adjusted to identify the specific contiguous blue shape(s) touching each seed and fill *only those shapes* with the seed's color.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the connectivity and color changes more formally for Example 1.\n\n"

Find all blue pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the seed pixel `(sr, sc)`.\n    c. For each adjacent blue pixel `(br, bc)` that has *not* already been colored (i.e., `(br, bc)` is not in `colored_blue_pixels`):\n        i.   Perform a flood fill (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) starting from `(br, bc)`.\n        ii.  The flood fill should only explore adjacent pixels `(nr, nc)` that are blue (1) in the *original input grid* and have *not* already been colored (i.e., `(nr, nc)` is not in `colored_blue_pixels`).\n        iii. For every blue pixel `(vr, vc)` visited during this flood fill (including the starting pixel `(br, bc)`):\n            *   Change the color of the pixel at `(vr, vc)` in the *output grid* to `seed_color`.\n            *   Add the coordinates `(vr, vc)` to the `colored_blue_pixels` set.\n5.  Return the final output grid."
