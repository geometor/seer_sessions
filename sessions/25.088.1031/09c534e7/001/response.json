For each seed pixel, it performs a flood fill operation starting from the adjacent blue pixels. The flood fill propagates only through contiguous blue pixels (using 4-way adjacency) in the original input grid. All blue pixels reached by the flood fill originating from a specific seed are changed to the color of that seed in the output grid. If multiple seeds could potentially fill the same blue pixel, the first fill operation reaching that pixel determines its final color (implicit BFS order, though examples don't show conflicts). The original seed pixels and background pixels remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_seeds(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds seed pixels (non-white, non-blue) in the grid.\"\"\"\n    seeds = []\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            color = grid[r, c]\n            if color != 0 and color != 1:\n                seeds.append(((r, c), color))\n    return seeds\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by flood-filling blue regions adjacent to \n    seed pixels with the seed's color.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n    seeds = find_seeds(input_grid)\n    \n    # Keep track of pixels already colored by a fill operation\n    visited_by_fill = set() \n\n    for seed_coord, seed_color in seeds:\n        sr, sc = seed_coord\n        q = deque()\n        \n        # Start the fill from the blue neighbors of the seed\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = sr + dr, sc + dc\n            \n            # Check bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                # Check if neighbor is blue in the *original* grid\n                # and hasn't been visited by *any* fill operation yet\n                if input_grid[nr, nc] == 1 and (nr, nc) not in visited_by_fill:\n                    # Add to queue for BFS\n                    q.append((nr, nc))\n                    # Mark as visited by a fill\n                    visited_by_fill.add((nr, nc))\n                    # Change color in the output grid\n                    output_grid[nr, nc] = seed_color\n                    \n        # Perform BFS\n        while q:\n            curr_r, curr_c = q.popleft()\n            \n            # Explore neighbors\n            for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n                \n                # Check bounds\n                if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                     # Check if neighbor is blue in the *original* grid\n                     # and hasn't been visited by *any* fill operation yet\n                    if input_grid[nr, nc] == 1 and (nr, nc) not in visited_by_fill:\n                        # Add to queue for BFS\n                        q.append((nr, nc))\n                         # Mark as visited by a fill\n                        visited_by_fill.add((nr, nc))\n                        # Change color in the output grid\n                        output_grid[nr, nc] = seed_color\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
