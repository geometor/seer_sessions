Transformation Rule Description:

The transformation identifies non-background (white, 0) and non-primary shape (blue, 1) pixels, referred to as "seed" pixels. For each seed pixel, it performs a flood fill operation starting from the adjacent blue pixels. The flood fill propagates only through contiguous blue pixels (using 4-way adjacency) in the original input grid. All blue pixels reached by the flood fill originating from a specific seed are changed to the color of that seed in the output grid. If multiple seeds could potentially fill the same blue pixel, the first fill operation reaching that pixel determines its final color (implicit BFS order, though examples don't show conflicts). The original seed pixels and background pixels remain unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.

## General Assessment

The previous code implemented a flood fill originating from the blue neighbors of each seed pixel. The results show that this approach incorrectly colors *all* reachable blue pixels connected to those initial neighbors, often extending far beyond the intended area and overwriting blue pixels that should remain blue.

The `Expected Output` in each example suggests a more localized effect: only the contiguous blue region(s) *directly adjacent* to a seed pixel are filled with that seed's color. Blue pixels belonging to regions not touching a seed, or blue pixels within a touching region but perhaps separated by a non-blue pixel (though this separation isn't explicitly shown in these examples, the fill clearly stops), remain blue.

The strategy needs to be adjusted to identify the specific contiguous blue shape(s) touching each seed and fill *only those shapes* with the seed's color.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the connectivity and color changes more formally for Example 1.

**Analysis of Metrics (Example 1):**

*   **Seeds:** Red (2) at (4, 14), Green (3) at (28, 17).
*   **Blue Pixels:** Input has 311 blue, Expected Output has 234 blue. A total of 311 - 234 = 77 blue pixels were changed.
*   **Red Seed (2):**
    *   It has 4 adjacent blue pixels.
    *   The *entire* contiguous blue component connected to these neighbors contains 180 pixels.
    *   However, only 48 pixels become red in the expected output. (NB: The metric code incorrectly counts the seed pixel itself if its color matches the fill color. There are 47 blue pixels changed to red).
*   **Green Seed (3):**
    *   It has 4 adjacent blue pixels.
    *   The *entire* contiguous blue component connected to these neighbors contains 131 pixels.
    *   However, only 31 pixels become green in the expected output. (NB: 30 blue pixels changed to green).
*   **Total Change:** 47 (red) + 30 (green) = 77 pixels changed color, which matches the difference in blue pixel counts (311 - 234 = 77).
*   **Connectivity:** The analysis confirms that the fill does *not* cover the entire connected blue component. It only covers a specific sub-region immediately adjacent to the seed. No blue pixels were found adjacent to multiple seeds.

This confirms the hypothesis: the fill is restricted to the visually distinct blue shape(s) directly touching the seed.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all "seed" pixels in the input grid (pixels that are neither white (0) nor blue (1)).
3.  Keep track of blue pixels that have already been assigned a new color to prevent processing them multiple times. Maintain a set called `colored_blue_pixels`.
4.  For each unique seed pixel found:
    a. Let the seed's color be `seed_color` and its coordinates be `(sr, sc)`.
    b. Find all blue pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the seed pixel `(sr, sc)`.
    c. For each adjacent blue pixel `(br, bc)` that has *not* already been colored (i.e., `(br, bc)` is not in `colored_blue_pixels`):
        i.   Perform a flood fill (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) starting from `(br, bc)`.
        ii.  The flood fill should only explore adjacent pixels `(nr, nc)` that are blue (1) in the *original input grid* and have *not* already been colored (i.e., `(nr, nc)` is not in `colored_blue_pixels`).
        iii. For every blue pixel `(vr, vc)` visited during this flood fill (including the starting pixel `(br, bc)`):
            *   Change the color of the pixel at `(vr, vc)` in the *output grid* to `seed_color`.
            *   Add the coordinates `(vr, vc)` to the `colored_blue_pixels` set.
5.  Return the final output grid.
