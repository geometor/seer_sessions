**General Assessment**

The previous code correctly identified the "seed" pixels (non-background, non-blue) and the target pixels (blue). It also correctly identified the action: changing the color of some blue pixels to the color of adjacent seed pixels. However, the results show that the transformation is more complex than simply changing the *immediately adjacent* blue pixels. The discrepancies between the transformed output and the expected output consistently show that the seed color should propagate further into the connected blue regions. The transformation appears to be a "flood fill" or "region coloring" operation starting from the blue pixels adjacent to a seed pixel. The color of the seed fills the entire connected component of blue pixels that it touches.

**Strategy for Resolution**

1.  Re-evaluate the interaction between seed pixels and blue pixels.
2.  Instead of changing only immediate neighbors, identify the connected component(s) of blue pixels that are adjacent to each seed pixel.
3.  Implement a flood-fill or similar region-finding algorithm to identify these connected blue components.
4.  Color the entire identified blue component with the corresponding seed color.
5.  Ensure the implementation correctly handles cases where a blue component might be adjacent to multiple seeds (though this doesn't seem to occur in the examples, it's a potential edge case). The current examples suggest each distinct blue region adjacent to a seed gets filled by that seed's color.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Let's analyze Example 1 to confirm the flood-fill hypothesis.

*   Input Grid Shape: (30, 30)
*   Seed Pixels:
    *   Red (2) at (4, 14)
    *   Green (3) at (28, 17)
*   Blue pixels (1) form several distinct connected shapes.

Consider the Red seed at (4, 14):
Its 4-way neighbors are (3, 14), (5, 14), (4, 13), (4, 15).
In the input grid:
*   (3, 14) is Blue (1)
*   (5, 14) is Blue (1)
*   (4, 13) is Blue (1)
*   (4, 15) is Blue (1)

In the expected output, a large connected area of pixels that were originally blue is now red (2). Let's verify if these red pixels in the output correspond to a single connected component of blue pixels in the input, adjacent to the red seed.
