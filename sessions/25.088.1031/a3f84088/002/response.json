            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully solved Example 2, which involved a simple rectangular frame with no internal gray pixels. However, it failed on Examples 1, 3, and 4.\n\n*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code incorrectly changed *all* internal white pixels not adjacent to the frame to gray. The expected output shows that only white pixels adjacent to the *newly created red border* should turn gray, while the remaining central white pixels should stay white. This suggests a multi-stage fill or propagation pattern when no internal gray exists.\n*   **Examples 3 & 4 Failure:** The code failed to correctly handle cases with *internal* gray pixels. It only turned white pixels adjacent to the *frame* red, ignoring those adjacent to *internal* gray pixels. Furthermore, it incorrectly applied the logic from the \"no internal gray\" case by changing other internal white pixels to gray, when they should have remained white.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Refine the logic for the case **without** internal gray pixels: Implement a two-step coloring process. First, color white pixels adjacent to the frame red. Second, color the *remaining* white pixels adjacent to the *newly red* pixels gray. White pixels not adjacent to either the frame or the new red pixels should remain white.\n2.  Refine the logic for the case **with** internal gray pixels: Ensure that white pixels adjacent (8-connectivity) to *any* gray pixel (frame or internal) are turned red. Crucially, ensure that *no other* internal pixels (white or gray) change color in this case.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's use the refined understanding to analyze the failed examples again.\n\n**Example 1 (No Internal Gray):**\n*   Input: 13x13 grid, gray frame from (1,1) to (9,9). Internal area (2,2) to (8,8) is white (0).\n*   Expected Output Logic (Refined):\n    1.  White pixels at (2,2)-(2,8), (8,2)-(8,8), (3,2)-(7,2), (3,8)-(7,8) are adjacent to the frame -> Turn Red (2).\n    2.  White pixels at (3,3)-(3,7), (7,3)-(7,7), (4,3)-(6,3), (4,7)-(6,7) are adjacent to the *new* red pixels -> Turn Gray (5).\n    3.  White pixels at (4,4)-(6,6) are not adjacent to frame or red -> Remain White (0).\n*   Transformed Output Discrepancy: The code turned the central (4,4)-(6,6) block gray instead of leaving it white. It failed step 2 and 3 of the refined logic.\n\n**Example 3 (Internal Gray Present):**\n*   Input: 16x16 grid, gray frame (1,3) to (12,14). Internal area (2,4) to (11,13). Contains internal gray pixels.\n*   Expected Output Logic (Refined):\n    1. White pixels inside the frame adjacent (8-conn) to *any* gray pixel (frame or internal) -> Turn Red (2).\n    2. All other pixels inside the frame (non-adjacent white, internal gray) -> Remain unchanged.\n*   Transformed Output Discrepancy: The code only turned white pixels adjacent to the *frame* red. It missed white pixels adjacent to *internal* gray pixels (e.g., around (6,8)-(7,9)). It also incorrectly changed non-adjacent white pixels to gray (e.g., (4,6)-(4,11)).\n\n**Example 4 (Internal Gray Present):**\n*   Input: 19x19 grid, gray frame (1,1) to (17,17). Internal area (2,2) to (16,16). Contains internal gray pixels.\n*   Expected Output Logic (Refined): Same as Example 3.\n*   Transformed Output Discrepancy: Same errors as Example 3 - only considered adjacency to the frame for redness and incorrectly changed other white pixels to gray.\n\n## YAML Fact Block\n\n"
