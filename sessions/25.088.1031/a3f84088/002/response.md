Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.

## General Assessment

The previous code successfully solved Example 2, which involved a simple rectangular frame with no internal gray pixels. However, it failed on Examples 1, 3, and 4.

*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code incorrectly changed *all* internal white pixels not adjacent to the frame to gray. The expected output shows that only white pixels adjacent to the *newly created red border* should turn gray, while the remaining central white pixels should stay white. This suggests a multi-stage fill or propagation pattern when no internal gray exists.
*   **Examples 3 & 4 Failure:** The code failed to correctly handle cases with *internal* gray pixels. It only turned white pixels adjacent to the *frame* red, ignoring those adjacent to *internal* gray pixels. Furthermore, it incorrectly applied the logic from the "no internal gray" case by changing other internal white pixels to gray, when they should have remained white.

**Strategy:**

1.  Refine the logic for the case **without** internal gray pixels: Implement a two-step coloring process. First, color white pixels adjacent to the frame red. Second, color the *remaining* white pixels adjacent to the *newly red* pixels gray. White pixels not adjacent to either the frame or the new red pixels should remain white.
2.  Refine the logic for the case **with** internal gray pixels: Ensure that white pixels adjacent (8-connectivity) to *any* gray pixel (frame or internal) are turned red. Crucially, ensure that *no other* internal pixels (white or gray) change color in this case.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's use the refined understanding to analyze the failed examples again.

**Example 1 (No Internal Gray):**
*   Input: 13x13 grid, gray frame from (1,1) to (9,9). Internal area (2,2) to (8,8) is white (0).
*   Expected Output Logic (Refined):
    1.  White pixels at (2,2)-(2,8), (8,2)-(8,8), (3,2)-(7,2), (3,8)-(7,8) are adjacent to the frame -> Turn Red (2).
    2.  White pixels at (3,3)-(3,7), (7,3)-(7,7), (4,3)-(6,3), (4,7)-(6,7) are adjacent to the *new* red pixels -> Turn Gray (5).
    3.  White pixels at (4,4)-(6,6) are not adjacent to frame or red -> Remain White (0).
*   Transformed Output Discrepancy: The code turned the central (4,4)-(6,6) block gray instead of leaving it white. It failed step 2 and 3 of the refined logic.

**Example 3 (Internal Gray Present):**
*   Input: 16x16 grid, gray frame (1,3) to (12,14). Internal area (2,4) to (11,13). Contains internal gray pixels.
*   Expected Output Logic (Refined):
    1. White pixels inside the frame adjacent (8-conn) to *any* gray pixel (frame or internal) -> Turn Red (2).
    2. All other pixels inside the frame (non-adjacent white, internal gray) -> Remain unchanged.
*   Transformed Output Discrepancy: The code only turned white pixels adjacent to the *frame* red. It missed white pixels adjacent to *internal* gray pixels (e.g., around (6,8)-(7,9)). It also incorrectly changed non-adjacent white pixels to gray (e.g., (4,6)-(4,11)).

**Example 4 (Internal Gray Present):**
*   Input: 19x19 grid, gray frame (1,1) to (17,17). Internal area (2,2) to (16,16). Contains internal gray pixels.
*   Expected Output Logic (Refined): Same as Example 3.
*   Transformed Output Discrepancy: Same errors as Example 3 - only considered adjacency to the frame for redness and incorrectly changed other white pixels to gray.

## YAML Fact Block


```yaml
task_description: Transforms the pixels within a gray rectangular frame based on adjacency rules and the presence of internal gray pixels.

frame:
  color: 5 (gray)
  shape: Rectangle (typically hollow, 1 pixel thick)
  role: Defines the boundary for the transformation.

internal_area:
  location: The region enclosed by the gray frame.
  initial_content: Can contain white (0) pixels and potentially other gray (5) pixels (internal structures).

transformation_rules:
  - condition: No gray (5) pixels exist inside the internal_area (excluding the frame itself).
    actions:
      - target: White (0) pixels inside the internal_area.
      - rule_1: If adjacent (8-connectivity) to the gray frame, change color to red (2).
      - rule_2: If *not* adjacent to the frame, but adjacent (8-connectivity) to pixels changed to red by rule_1, change color to gray (5).
      - rule_3: If not adjacent to frame (rule_1) or newly red pixels (rule_2), remain white (0).
      - other_pixels: Frame pixels and pixels outside the frame remain unchanged.
  - condition: Gray (5) pixels exist inside the internal_area (excluding the frame itself).
    actions:
      - target: White (0) pixels inside the internal_area.
      - rule_1: If adjacent (8-connectivity) to *any* gray pixel (frame OR internal), change color to red (2).
      - other_pixels: Frame pixels, internal gray pixels, and white pixels not meeting rule_1 remain unchanged.

adjacency:
  type: 8-connectivity (includes diagonals).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify the Frame:** Locate all gray (5) pixels. Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices they occupy to define the bounding box of the frame.
2.  **Define Internal Area:** The internal area consists of all pixels strictly within the bounding box (i.e., row > min_row, row < max_row, col > min_col, col < max_col).
3.  **Check for Internal Grays:** Scan the internal area. Determine if any pixel within this area has the color gray (5).
4.  **Apply Transformation (Case 1: No Internal Grays):**
    a.  Create a copy of the input grid to modify.
    b.  Identify all white (0) pixels within the internal area.
    c.  **First Pass (Red):** Iterate through the internal white pixels. If a white pixel is adjacent (8-connectivity) to any gray (5) pixel *on the frame*, change its color to red (2) in the copied grid. Keep track of which pixels were changed to red.
    d.  **Second Pass (Gray):** Iterate through the *remaining* white (0) pixels within the internal area (those not turned red in the previous step). If such a pixel is adjacent (8-connectivity) to any pixel that was changed to *red* (2) in the previous step, change its color to gray (5) in the copied grid.
    e.  Pixels not changed in steps 4c or 4d remain white (0). Frame pixels and pixels outside the frame remain unchanged. Output the modified grid.
5.  **Apply Transformation (Case 2: Internal Grays Exist):**
    a.  Create a copy of the input grid to modify.
    b.  Identify all white (0) pixels within the internal area.
    c.  Iterate through the internal white pixels. If a white pixel is adjacent (8-connectivity) to *any* gray (5) pixel (either on the frame OR within the internal area), change its color to red (2) in the copied grid.
    d.  All other pixels (original frame pixels, original internal gray pixels, white pixels not adjacent to any gray, and pixels outside the frame) remain unchanged. Output the modified grid.
6.  **Edge Case:** If no gray frame is found, return the input grid unchanged.
