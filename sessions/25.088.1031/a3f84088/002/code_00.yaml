task_description: Transforms the pixels within a gray rectangular frame based on adjacency rules and the presence of internal gray pixels.

frame:
  color: 5 (gray)
  shape: Rectangle (typically hollow, 1 pixel thick)
  role: Defines the boundary for the transformation.

internal_area:
  location: The region enclosed by the gray frame.
  initial_content: Can contain white (0) pixels and potentially other gray (5) pixels (internal structures).

transformation_rules:
  - condition: No gray (5) pixels exist inside the internal_area (excluding the frame itself).
    actions:
      - target: White (0) pixels inside the internal_area.
      - rule_1: If adjacent (8-connectivity) to the gray frame, change color to red (2).
      - rule_2: If *not* adjacent to the frame, but adjacent (8-connectivity) to pixels changed to red by rule_1, change color to gray (5).
      - rule_3: If not adjacent to frame (rule_1) or newly red pixels (rule_2), remain white (0).
      - other_pixels: Frame pixels and pixels outside the frame remain unchanged.
  - condition: Gray (5) pixels exist inside the internal_area (excluding the frame itself).
    actions:
      - target: White (0) pixels inside the internal_area.
      - rule_1: If adjacent (8-connectivity) to *any* gray pixel (frame OR internal), change color to red (2).
      - other_pixels: Frame pixels, internal gray pixels, and white pixels not meeting rule_1 remain unchanged.

adjacency:
  type: 8-connectivity (includes diagonals).
