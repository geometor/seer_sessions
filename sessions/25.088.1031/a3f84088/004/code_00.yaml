task_description: "Fill the area inside a gray rectangular frame with alternating layers of red and gray, starting with red adjacent to the frame, only if the internal area contains no gray pixels initially. If internal gray pixels exist, only color white pixels adjacent to any gray pixel (frame or internal) red."

definitions:
  - object: Frame
    properties:
      - color: Gray (5)
      - shape: Rectangle (defined by min/max row/col of gray pixels)
      - role: Boundary container
  - object: InternalArea
    properties:
      - location: Pixels strictly inside the Frame boundaries
      - initial_colors: Can be White (0) or contain other colors including Gray (5)
  - object: ColorLayer
    properties:
      - color: Alternates Red (2) and Gray (5)
      - generation: Iterative, based on adjacency (8-connectivity) to the previously generated layer or the initial Frame.

transformation_rules:
  - condition: A Gray (5) rectangular Frame exists AND the InternalArea contains NO Gray (5) pixels.
    actions:
      - Initialize CurrentLayerPixels = coordinates of all Frame pixels (color 5).
      - Initialize CurrentColorToPlace = Red (2).
      - loop:
          - Find CandidatePixels = all White (0) pixels in InternalArea adjacent (8-connectivity) to any pixel in CurrentLayerPixels.
          - If no CandidatePixels are found, break loop.
          - Change color of CandidatePixels to CurrentColorToPlace.
          - Update CurrentLayerPixels = coordinates of CandidatePixels just colored.
          - Toggle CurrentColorToPlace: If Red (2), change to Gray (5); if Gray (5), change to Red (2).
      - Leave pixels outside the Frame unchanged.
  - condition: A Gray (5) rectangular Frame exists AND the InternalArea CONTAINS Gray (5) pixels.
    actions:
      - Find TargetPixels = all White (0) pixels in InternalArea adjacent (8-connectivity) to *any* Gray (5) pixel (either part of the Frame or in the InternalArea).
      - Change color of TargetPixels to Red (2).
      - Leave all other pixels (including original internal Gray pixels and non-adjacent White pixels) unchanged.
  - condition: No Gray (5) rectangular Frame is found.
    actions:
      - Return the input grid unchanged.

adjacency: Uses 8-connectivity (including diagonals).
