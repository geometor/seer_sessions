Input train\\_2 only has the outer frame enclosing a purely white area.\n    *   The output grids retain the original gray structures.\n    *   The transformation involves changing the color of the white (0) pixels located inside the main gray frame.\n    *   The specific change depends on whether there are internal gray structures and the adjacency of white pixels to *any* gray pixel.\n    *   A new color, red (2), is introduced in the output, typically appearing in white pixels directly adjacent (sharing an edge or a corner) to gray pixels.\n    *   In the case without internal gray structures (train\\_2), the white pixels *not* adjacent to the frame are filled with the frame color (gray, 5), while the adjacent ones become red (2).\n    *   In cases with internal gray structures (train\\_1, train\\_3, train\\_4), only the white pixels adjacent to *any* gray pixel (either the frame or the internal structures) are changed to red (2); other white pixels remain white (0).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
