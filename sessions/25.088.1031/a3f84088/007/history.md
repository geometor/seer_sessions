"""
Transforms the pixels within a gray rectangular frame based on adjacency rules and the presence of internal gray pixels.

1.  Identify the gray (5) rectangular frame and the area it encloses.
2.  Check if any gray (5) pixels exist within the enclosed area (excluding the frame itself).
3.  If no internal gray pixels exist (Case 1):
    a.  Initialize the first layer of pixels adjacent to the frame (inside) as red (2).
    b.  Iteratively fill inwards: pixels adjacent (8-connectivity) to the last colored layer are colored with the alternate color (gray (5) if the last was red, red (2) if the last was gray).
    c.  This continues until no more white (0) pixels inside the frame can be colored.
4.  If internal gray pixels exist (Case 2):
    a.  Change white (0) pixels inside the frame that are adjacent (8-connectivity) to *any* gray pixel (frame or internal) to red (2).
    b.  Leave all other pixels unchanged (including internal grays).
5.  If no gray frame is found, return the input grid unchanged.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a gray rectangular frame and filling the interior based on two cases: whether or not there are gray pixels inside the frame (excluding the frame itself).

The results show that the code correctly solves Example 2 but fails on Examples 1, 3, and 4. All failures occur in the case where there are *no* internal gray pixels (Case 1). The core issue seems to be in the iterative filling logic (`_get_adjacent_white_pixels` and the `while` loop in `transform`). The current implementation incorrectly colors pixels in subsequent layers, leading to discrepancies compared to the expected outputs.

The pattern in the expected outputs for Case 1 suggests a layered filling, alternating colors (red, then gray, then red, etc.) based on the distance from the initial gray frame. The current code seems to overfill or misplace colors in the inner layers.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Case 1 Logic:** Modify the iterative filling process to correctly implement the layered, alternating color fill. Instead of finding all white pixels adjacent to the *entire set* of previously colored pixels, the logic should find white pixels adjacent *only* to the *most recently added layer* of colored pixels. This ensures a proper wave-like expansion from the frame inwards. A Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach, keeping track of layers or distances, would be suitable.
2.  **Verify Case 2 Logic:** Although no examples failed for Case 2, review the implementation to ensure it accurately reflects the simpler rule: color all internal white pixels adjacent to *any* gray pixel (frame or internal) red.
3.  **Edge Cases:** Consider potential edge cases like very thin frames (1 or 2 pixels thick interiors) or frames that aren't perfectly rectangular (though the problem description implies rectangular frames). The frame finding logic might need refinement if non-rectangular gray shapes are possible.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the area inside a gray rectangular frame with alternating colors based on distance from the frame, or fill based on adjacency to gray if internal gray pixels exist.
grid_properties:
  - size: Variable height and width (up to 30x30).
  - background_color: white (0).
objects:
  - type: Frame
    color: gray (5)
    shape: Rectangle (can be hollow)
    location: Encloses an area of the grid.
  - type: Fill Pattern
    colors: [red (2), gray (5)]
    location: Inside the frame area.
    rules:
      - Determined by the presence or absence of internal gray pixels.
  - type: Internal Gray Pixels
    color: gray (5)
    location: Inside the frame area (not part of the frame itself).
    significance: Changes the fill rule.
actions:
  - action: Find Frame
    inputs: input grid
    outputs: coordinates of the gray frame (min/max row/col), boolean indicating if internal gray pixels exist.
    condition: A gray frame must exist. If not, return input unchanged.
  - action: Fill Case 1 (No Internal Gray)
    condition: Frame exists, no gray pixels inside the frame area.
    steps:
      - Identify internal white pixels adjacent (8-connectivity) to the gray frame. Color them red (2). This is Layer 1.
      - Identify internal white pixels adjacent (8-connectivity) *only* to the red pixels of Layer 1. Color them gray (5). This is Layer 2.
      - Identify internal white pixels adjacent (8-connectivity) *only* to the gray pixels of Layer 2. Color them red (2). This is Layer 3.
      - Continue alternating red and gray layers, where each new layer consists of white pixels adjacent *only* to the pixels of the immediately preceding layer, until no more white pixels can be colored this way.
    outputs: Modified grid with layered fill pattern.
  - action: Fill Case 2 (Internal Gray Exists)
    condition: Frame exists, gray pixels are present inside the frame area.
    steps:
      - Identify all internal white pixels that are adjacent (8-connectivity) to *any* gray pixel (either part of the frame or an internal gray pixel).
      - Color all such identified white pixels red (2).
      - Leave all other internal pixels (including internal grays and non-adjacent whites) unchanged.
    outputs: Modified grid with red fill adjacent to grays.
connectivity: 8-way adjacency (includes diagonals) is used for determining neighbors for filling.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Gray Frame and Check Interior:**
    *   Scan the input grid to find all gray (5) pixels.
    *   Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices that encompass all gray pixels. Assume these define the bounding box of the potential frame.
    *   *Validate Frame:* (Optional but recommended) Check if all pixels along the perimeter defined by the bounding box are indeed gray. If not, it might not be a simple rectangular frame, and the behavior might be undefined or fall under Case 2 if internal grays exist relative to the bounding box. For this task's examples, assume the min/max coordinates reliably define the frame boundary.
    *   Examine the area strictly inside the bounding box (min\_row+1 to max\_row-1, min\_col+1 to max\_col-1). Check if any gray (5) pixels exist within this internal area.
    *   If no gray pixels were found anywhere in the grid, return the input grid unchanged.

2.  **Apply Fill Logic Based on Interior Check:**
    *   **Case 1: No Internal Gray Pixels Found:**
        *   Create a copy of the input grid to modify.
        *   Initialize a set of 'current layer coordinates' with the coordinates of the gray (5) frame pixels.
        *   Set the initial 'color to paint' to red (2).
        *   Start an iterative process:
            *   Find all white (0) pixels located strictly *inside* the frame's bounding box that are adjacent (8-connectivity) to *any* pixel in the 'current layer coordinates' set, AND have not already been colored in previous iterations.
            *   If no such white pixels are found, stop the iteration.
            *   Color all found white pixels with the 'color to paint'.
            *   Update the 'current layer coordinates' set to contain *only* the coordinates of the pixels just colored in this step.
            *   Toggle the 'color to paint': if it was red (2), change it to gray (5); if it was gray (5), change it to red (2).
            *   Repeat the process.
        *   Return the modified grid.
    *   **Case 2: Internal Gray Pixels Found:**
        *   Create a copy of the input grid to modify.
        *   Identify the coordinates of *all* gray (5) pixels (both frame and internal).
        *   Iterate through all pixels strictly *inside* the frame's bounding box.
        *   For each internal pixel, if it is white (0), check its 8 neighbors. If any neighbor is a gray (5) pixel (from the set identified earlier), change the white pixel's color to red (2) in the copied grid.
        *   Return the modified grid.
