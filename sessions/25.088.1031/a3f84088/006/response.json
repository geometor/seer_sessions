            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a gray rectangular frame and filling the interior based on two cases: whether or not there are gray pixels inside the frame (excluding the frame itself).\n\nThe results show that the code correctly solves Example 2 but fails on Examples 1, 3, and 4. All failures occur in the case where there are *no* internal gray pixels (Case 1). The core issue seems to be in the iterative filling logic (`_get_adjacent_white_pixels` and the `while` loop in `transform`). The current implementation incorrectly colors pixels in subsequent layers, leading to discrepancies compared to the expected outputs.\n\nThe pattern in the expected outputs for Case 1 suggests a layered filling, alternating colors (red, then gray, then red, etc.) based on the distance from the initial gray frame. The current code seems to overfill or misplace colors in the inner layers.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Case 1 Logic:** Modify the iterative filling process to correctly implement the layered, alternating color fill. Instead of finding all white pixels adjacent to the *entire set* of previously colored pixels, the logic should find white pixels adjacent *only* to the *most recently added layer* of colored pixels. This ensures a proper wave-like expansion from the frame inwards. A Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach, keeping track of layers or distances, would be suitable.\n2.  **Verify Case 2 Logic:** Although no examples failed for Case 2, review the implementation to ensure it accurately reflects the simpler rule: color all internal white pixels adjacent to *any* gray pixel (frame or internal) red.\n3.  **Edge Cases:** Consider potential edge cases like very thin frames (1 or 2 pixels thick interiors) or frames that aren't perfectly rectangular (though the problem description implies rectangular frames). The frame finding logic might need refinement if non-rectangular gray shapes are possible.\n\n**Metrics**\n"

Assume these define the bounding box of the potential frame.\n    *   *Validate Frame:* (Optional but recommended) Check if all pixels along the perimeter defined by the bounding box are indeed gray. If not, it might not be a simple rectangular frame, and the behavior might be undefined or fall under Case 2 if internal grays exist relative to the bounding box. For this task's examples, assume the min/max coordinates reliably define the frame boundary.\n    *   Examine the area strictly inside the bounding box (min\\_row+1 to max\\_row-1, min\\_col+1 to max\\_col-1). Check if any gray (5) pixels exist within this internal area.\n    *   If no gray pixels were found anywhere in the grid, return the input grid unchanged.\n\n2.  **Apply Fill Logic Based on Interior Check:**\n    *   **Case 1: No Internal Gray Pixels Found:**\n        *   Create a copy of the input grid to modify.\n        *   Initialize a set of 'current layer coordinates' with the coordinates of the gray (5) frame pixels.\n        *   Set the initial 'color to paint' to red (2).\n        *   Start an iterative process:\n            *   Find all white (0) pixels located strictly *inside* the frame's bounding box that are adjacent (8-connectivity) to *any* pixel in the 'current layer coordinates' set, AND have not already been colored in previous iterations.\n            *   If no such white pixels are found, stop the iteration.\n            *   Color all found white pixels with the 'color to paint'.\n            *   Update the 'current layer coordinates' set to contain *only* the coordinates of the pixels just colored in this step.\n            *   Toggle the 'color to paint': if it was red (2), change it to gray (5); if it was gray (5), change it to red (2).\n            *   Repeat the process.\n        *   Return the modified grid.\n    *   **Case 2: Internal Gray Pixels Found:**\n        *   Create a copy of the input grid to modify.\n        *   Identify the coordinates of *all* gray (5) pixels (both frame and internal).\n        *   Iterate through all pixels strictly *inside* the frame's bounding box.\n        *   For each internal pixel, if it is white (0), check its 8 neighbors. If any neighbor is a gray (5) pixel (from the set identified earlier), change the white pixel's color to red (2) in the copied grid.\n        *   Return the modified grid."
