task_description: Fill the area inside a gray rectangular frame with alternating colors based on distance from the frame, or fill based on adjacency to gray if internal gray pixels exist.
grid_properties:
  - size: Variable height and width (up to 30x30).
  - background_color: white (0).
objects:
  - type: Frame
    color: gray (5)
    shape: Rectangle (can be hollow)
    location: Encloses an area of the grid.
  - type: Fill Pattern
    colors: [red (2), gray (5)]
    location: Inside the frame area.
    rules:
      - Determined by the presence or absence of internal gray pixels.
  - type: Internal Gray Pixels
    color: gray (5)
    location: Inside the frame area (not part of the frame itself).
    significance: Changes the fill rule.
actions:
  - action: Find Frame
    inputs: input grid
    outputs: coordinates of the gray frame (min/max row/col), boolean indicating if internal gray pixels exist.
    condition: A gray frame must exist. If not, return input unchanged.
  - action: Fill Case 1 (No Internal Gray)
    condition: Frame exists, no gray pixels inside the frame area.
    steps:
      - Identify internal white pixels adjacent (8-connectivity) to the gray frame. Color them red (2). This is Layer 1.
      - Identify internal white pixels adjacent (8-connectivity) *only* to the red pixels of Layer 1. Color them gray (5). This is Layer 2.
      - Identify internal white pixels adjacent (8-connectivity) *only* to the gray pixels of Layer 2. Color them red (2). This is Layer 3.
      - Continue alternating red and gray layers, where each new layer consists of white pixels adjacent *only* to the pixels of the immediately preceding layer, until no more white pixels can be colored this way.
    outputs: Modified grid with layered fill pattern.
  - action: Fill Case 2 (Internal Gray Exists)
    condition: Frame exists, gray pixels are present inside the frame area.
    steps:
      - Identify all internal white pixels that are adjacent (8-connectivity) to *any* gray pixel (either part of the frame or an internal gray pixel).
      - Color all such identified white pixels red (2).
      - Leave all other internal pixels (including internal grays and non-adjacent whites) unchanged.
    outputs: Modified grid with red fill adjacent to grays.
connectivity: 8-way adjacency (includes diagonals) is used for determining neighbors for filling.
