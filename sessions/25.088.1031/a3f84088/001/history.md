*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids consistently feature a primary rectangular frame constructed from gray (5) pixels, enclosing an area initially filled predominantly with white (0) pixels.
    *   Some inputs (train\_1, train\_3, train\_4) contain additional gray (5) structures within the area enclosed by the main frame. Input train\_2 only has the outer frame enclosing a purely white area.
    *   The output grids retain the original gray structures.
    *   The transformation involves changing the color of the white (0) pixels located inside the main gray frame.
    *   The specific change depends on whether there are internal gray structures and the adjacency of white pixels to *any* gray pixel.
    *   A new color, red (2), is introduced in the output, typically appearing in white pixels directly adjacent (sharing an edge or a corner) to gray pixels.
    *   In the case without internal gray structures (train\_2), the white pixels *not* adjacent to the frame are filled with the frame color (gray, 5), while the adjacent ones become red (2).
    *   In cases with internal gray structures (train\_1, train\_3, train\_4), only the white pixels adjacent to *any* gray pixel (either the frame or the internal structures) are changed to red (2); other white pixels remain white (0).

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - object: frame
        color: gray (5)
        description: A rectangular boundary made of gray pixels. Present in all examples.
      - object: internal_structure
        color: gray (5)
        description: Additional gray pixels or shapes located within the area enclosed by the main frame. Present in train_1, train_3, train_4. Absent in train_2.
      - object: enclosed_area
        color: white (0)
        description: The region inside the main frame, initially primarily white.
      - object: fill_pixels_type1
        color: red (2)
        description: Pixels resulting from transforming white pixels adjacent to gray pixels.
      - object: fill_pixels_type2
        color: gray (5)
        description: Pixels resulting from transforming non-adjacent white pixels, only occurs when no internal gray structures are present (train_2).

    properties:
      - adjacency: White pixels can be adjacent (sharing edge or corner) to gray pixels.
      - containment: The main frame encloses an area. Internal structures are contained within this area.
      - purity: The enclosed area in train_2 initially contains only white pixels, while others contain white and gray pixels.

    actions:
      - identify: Locate the main gray frame.
      - identify: Locate all gray pixels (frame + internal).
      - identify: Locate all white pixels within the frame.
      - check: Determine if gray pixels exist inside the main frame's enclosed area (excluding the frame itself).
      - check: Determine adjacency between white and gray pixels (8-connectivity: edges and corners).
      - transform: Change color of white pixels to red (2) based on adjacency.
      - transform: Change color of remaining white pixels to gray (5) under specific conditions (no internal gray structures).

    relationships:
      - rule_dependency: The transformation rule applied depends on whether internal gray structures exist within the main frame.
      - color_change_trigger: Adjacency to a gray pixel triggers the change of a white pixel to red.
      - secondary_fill: Lack of adjacency combined with the absence of internal gray structures triggers a change to gray.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the primary gray (5) rectangular frame in the input grid. Define the enclosed area as the region inside this frame.
    2.  Check if there are any gray (5) pixels within the enclosed area (excluding the pixels of the frame itself).
    3.  **Case 1: No internal gray pixels found within the enclosed area.**
        a.  Identify all white (0) pixels within the enclosed area.
        b.  Change the color of the white pixels that are adjacent (sharing an edge or corner) to the gray frame pixels to red (2).
        c.  Change the color of all remaining white pixels (those not adjacent to the frame) within the enclosed area to gray (5).
    4.  **Case 2: Internal gray pixels are found within the enclosed area.**
        a.  Identify *all* gray (5) pixels in the grid (both the frame and internal structures).
        b.  Identify all white (0) pixels within the enclosed area.
        c.  Change the color of *only* those white pixels that are adjacent (sharing an edge or corner) to *any* gray pixel to red (2).
        d.  Leave all other pixels (including non-adjacent white pixels and all gray pixels) unchanged.
    5.  The resulting grid is the output.
