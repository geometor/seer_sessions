Okay, let's break down the perception, facts, and the natural language program for this task.

## Perception

The input grids display a clear, repeating pattern across most of their area. This pattern seems to be formed by tiling a smaller rectangular block of colors. The first row and first column often consist of a single color (blue, color 1) acting as a border or separator for the pattern tiles.

The key feature distinguishing the input from the output is the presence of white pixels (color 0) in the input. These white pixels appear as "damage" or "holes" obscuring parts of the underlying repeating pattern.

The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that the white pixels have been replaced. The replacement color for each white pixel is the color that *should* be at that location according to the surrounding, undamaged repeating pattern.

The task, therefore, is to:
1.  Identify the repeating pattern unit (the tile).
2.  Determine the dimensions (height and width) of this tile.
3.  Figure out the correct color for each position within the tile based on the undamaged parts of the input grid.
4.  "Repair" the input grid by filling in the white pixels with the inferred pattern colors based on their position relative to the repeating tile structure.

## Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - object: grid
    attributes:
      - type: input / output
      - size: constant (25x25 in examples)
  - object: pattern
    attributes:
      - type: repeating / tiled
      - location: covers most of the grid, excluding potential border
      - state: can be obscured / damaged
    relationships:
      - defined_by: a smaller rectangular tile
  - object: tile
    attributes:
      - shape: rectangle
      - content: specific arrangement of colors
      - size: (H, W), varies between examples (e.g., 6x6, 7x7, 4x4)
    relationships:
      - repeats: horizontally and vertically to form the pattern
  - object: border
    attributes:
      - color: typically blue (1)
      - location: often the first row and first column
      - function: separates pattern tiles
    relationships:
      - contains: the repeating pattern area
  - object: damage
    attributes:
      - representation: white pixels (color 0)
      - location: appears within the pattern area
      - shape: contiguous or scattered blocks
    relationships:
      - obscures: the underlying pattern

actions:
  - action: identify_periodicity
    actor: system
    input: input grid
    output: tile dimensions (H, W)
    description: Find the vertical (H) and horizontal (W) period of the repeating pattern, ignoring borders and white pixels.
  - action: infer_pattern
    actor: system
    input: input grid, tile dimensions (H, W)
    output: reference tile pattern
    description: For each position within a tile, determine the correct color by finding the most frequent non-white, non-border color at corresponding positions across all repetitions in the input grid.
  - action: repair_grid
    actor: system
    input: input grid, reference tile pattern, tile dimensions (H, W)
    output: output grid
    description: Iterate through the input grid. If a pixel is white and located within the pattern area (not the border), replace it with the color from the reference tile pattern corresponding to its position within the tile's structure. Otherwise, keep the original pixel color.

transformations:
  - type: pattern_restoration
    input: grid with damaged pattern
    output: grid with restored pattern
    steps:
      - identify_periodicity
      - infer_pattern
      - repair_grid
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Periodicity**: Examine the input grid, ignoring the first row, first column, and any white pixels (color 0). Determine the smallest vertical distance (H) and horizontal distance (W) at which the pattern of colors consistently repeats. These define the height and width of the fundamental repeating tile.
2.  **Reconstruct Reference Tile**: Create a template tile of size H x W. For each position `(tr, tc)` within this template tile (where `0 <= tr < H`, `0 <= tc < W`):
    a.  Identify all locations `(row, col)` in the *input grid* such that `row > 0`, `col > 0`, `(row - 1) % H == tr`, and `(col - 1) % W == tc`.
    b.  Collect the colors at these locations, excluding white (0).
    c.  Determine the most frequently occurring color among those collected.
    d.  Assign this most frequent color to the position `(tr, tc)` in the reference tile.
3.  **Generate Output Grid**: Create a new grid initially identical to the input grid.
4.  **Fill Damaged Pixels**: Iterate through each pixel `(row, col)` of the new grid. If the pixel color is white (0) *and* it is not in the first row (`row > 0`) or first column (`col > 0`):
    a.  Calculate its position within the tile structure: `tr = (row - 1) % H`, `tc = (col - 1) % W`.
    b.  Replace the white pixel at `(row, col)` with the color stored at `(tr, tc)` in the reconstructed reference tile.
5.  **Final Output**: The modified grid, with the white pixels replaced by the inferred pattern colors, is the final output.
