            "text": "Okay, let's break down the perception, facts, and the natural language program for this task.\n\n## Perception\n\nThe input grids display a clear, repeating pattern across most of their area. This pattern seems to be formed by tiling a smaller rectangular block of colors. The first row and first column often consist of a single color (blue, color 1) acting as a border or separator for the pattern tiles.\n\nThe key feature distinguishing the input from the output is the presence of white pixels (color 0) in the input. These white pixels appear as \"damage\" or \"holes\" obscuring parts of the underlying repeating pattern.\n\nThe output grid is identical to the input grid, except that the white pixels have been replaced. The replacement color for each white pixel is the color that *should* be at that location according to the surrounding, undamaged repeating pattern.\n\nThe task, therefore, is to:\n1.  Identify the repeating pattern unit (the tile).\n2.  Determine the dimensions (height and width) of this tile.\n3.  Figure out the correct color for each position within the tile based on the undamaged parts of the input grid.\n4.  \"Repair\" the input grid by filling in the white pixels with the inferred pattern colors based on their position relative to the repeating tile structure.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Determine the smallest vertical distance (H) and horizontal distance (W) at which the pattern of colors consistently repeats. These define the height and width of the fundamental repeating tile.\n2.  **Reconstruct Reference Tile**: Create a template tile of size H x W. For each position `(tr, tc)` within this template tile (where `0 <= tr < H`, `0 <= tc < W`):\n    a.  Identify all locations `(row, col)` in the *input grid* such that `row > 0`, `col > 0`, `(row - 1) % H == tr`, and `(col - 1) % W == tc`.\n    b.  Collect the colors at these locations, excluding white (0).\n    c.  Determine the most frequently occurring color among those collected.\n    d.  Assign this most frequent color to the position `(tr, tc)` in the reference tile.\n3.  **Generate Output Grid**: Create a new grid initially identical to the input grid.\n4.  **Fill Damaged Pixels**: Iterate through each pixel `(row, col)` of the new grid. If the pixel color is white (0) *and* it is not in the first row (`row > 0`) or first column (`col > 0`):\n    a.  Calculate its position within the tile structure: `tr = (row - 1) % H`, `tc = (col - 1) % W`.\n    b.  Replace the white pixel at `(row, col)` with the color stored at `(tr, tc)` in the reconstructed reference tile.\n5.  **Final Output**: The modified grid, with the white pixels replaced by the inferred pattern colors, is the final output."
