It then reconstructs the ideal tile pattern based on the non-damaged portions of the grid. Finally, it repairs the input grid by filling in any damaged pixels (color 0) outside the border with the corresponding color from the reconstructed ideal tile, based on their position relative to the repeating pattern.\n\nSteps:\n1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the repeating tile pattern by analyzing the grid's periodicity, ignoring the first row, first column, and white (0) pixels.\n2.  Create a reference tile of size H x W. For each position (tr, tc) in the reference tile, find the most common non-zero color found at all corresponding positions ((r, c) such that r>0, c>0, (r-1)%H == tr, and (c-1)%W == tc) in the input grid.\n3.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n4.  Iterate through the output grid. If a pixel at (r, c) is white (0) and is not in the first row or column (r>0 and c>0), replace its value with the color from the reference tile at position ((r-1)%H, (c-1)%W).\n5.  Return the repaired output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_periodicity(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the smallest repeating period (H, W) of the pattern in the grid,\n    ignoring the first row/column and any zero values.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    best_H, best_W = -1, -1\n\n    # Iterate through possible periods (H_candidate, W_candidate)\n    # Limit search to reasonable sizes (e.g., up to half grid size + buffer)\n    max_h_check = min(height -1 , height // 2 + 2) \n    max_w_check = min(width - 1, width // 2 + 2)\n\n    for H_candidate in range(1, max_h_check):\n        for W_candidate in range(1, max_w_check):\n            is_consistent = True\n            has_comparisons = False # Track if any comparison was actually made\n\n            # Check consistency across the grid, ignoring border and 0s\n            for r in range(1, height):\n                for c in range(1, width):\n                    val = grid[r, c]\n                    if val == 0: continue # Cannot verify using a damaged cell\n\n                    # Check vertical consistency\n                    if r + H_candidate < height:\n                        val_down = grid[r + H_candidate, c]\n                        if val_down != 0:\n                            has_comparisons = True\n                            if val != val_down:\n                                is_consistent = False\n                                break # Mismatch found\n\n                    # Check horizontal consistency\n                    if c + W_candidate < width:\n                        val_right = grid[r, c + W_candidate]\n                        if val_right != 0:\n                            has_comparisons = True\n                            if val != val_right:\n                                is_consistent = False\n                                break # Mismatch found\n                if not is_consistent:\n                    break # Stop checking this H, W candidate\n\n            # If consistent and comparisons were made, store as potential best\n            if is_consistent and has_comparisons:\n                if best_H == -1: # First valid period found\n                    best_H, best_W = H_candidate, W_candidate\n                else:\n                    # Prefer smaller area (H*W)\n                    if H_candidate * W_candidate < best_H * best_W:\n                        best_H, best_W = H_candidate, W_candidate\n                    # Tie-break: prefer smaller H, then smaller W\n                    elif H_candidate * W_candidate == best_H * best_W:\n                         if H_candidate < best_H:\n                              best_H, best_W = H_candidate, W_candidate\n                         elif H_candidate == best_H and W_candidate < best_W:\n                              best_H, best_W = H_candidate, W_candidate\n                # Optimization: Once the smallest possible periods (1,1), (1,2), (2,1) etc. are checked\n                # and a valid one is found, larger periods derived from it are less likely\n                # to be the *fundamental* period.
