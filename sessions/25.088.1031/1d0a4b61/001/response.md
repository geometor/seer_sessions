"""
The transformation rule identifies a repeating pattern (tile) within the input grid, ignoring a border row (0) and column (0), and any damaged pixels (color 0). It then reconstructs the ideal tile pattern based on the non-damaged portions of the grid. Finally, it repairs the input grid by filling in any damaged pixels (color 0) outside the border with the corresponding color from the reconstructed ideal tile, based on their position relative to the repeating pattern.

Steps:
1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the repeating tile pattern by analyzing the grid's periodicity, ignoring the first row, first column, and white (0) pixels.
2.  Create a reference tile of size H x W. For each position (tr, tc) in the reference tile, find the most common non-zero color found at all corresponding positions ((r, c) such that r>0, c>0, (r-1)%H == tr, and (c-1)%W == tc) in the input grid.
3.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4.  Iterate through the output grid. If a pixel at (r, c) is white (0) and is not in the first row or column (r>0 and c>0), replace its value with the color from the reference tile at position ((r-1)%H, (c-1)%W).
5.  Return the repaired output grid.
