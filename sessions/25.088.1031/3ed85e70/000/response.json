            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are consistently 30x30.\n2.  **Distinct Regions:** The grid is visually divided into two horizontal regions:\n    *   **Upper Region (Rows 0-6):** Characterized by a green (3) background. Contains several distinct, self-contained patterns or \"templates\".\n    *   **Lower Region (Rows 7-29):** Characterized by a white (0) background. Contains scattered, often incomplete shapes or \"fragments\" that seem related to the templates in the upper region.\n3.  **Templates (Upper Region):** These appear to be reference patterns. Each template consists of an outer border of one color and an inner pattern of potentially different colors. Examples:\n    *   Train 1: Blue(1) border with Azure(8) inside; Red(2) border with Yellow(4) inside.\n    *   Train 2: Red(2) with Blue(1); Azure(8) with Yellow(4); Blue(1) with Red(2); Green(3) border (empty inside?).\n    *   Train 3: Blue(1)/Red(2) mix border/inside; Azure(8) border with Yellow(4) inside; Magenta(6) border with Azure(8) inside.\n4.  **Fragments (Lower Region):** These are contiguous blocks of a single color (other than the white background). They often resemble parts of the outer borders of the templates found in the upper region.\n5.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The upper region (rows 0-6) is copied *exactly* from the input to the output.\n    *   The lower region (rows 7-29) is modified. The core transformation seems to be: find fragments in the input's lower region. If a fragment's color matches the *outer border color* of a template in the upper region, that fragment is replaced in the output grid by the *complete* template pattern (border and inner content), anchored at the fragment's top-left position. Fragments whose colors do not match any template's outer border color, or the background white pixels, remain unchanged unless overwritten by a placed template.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Examine the input grid's upper region (rows 0-6).\n    b.  Identify all distinct \"template\" objects surrounded by the green (3) background color.\n    c.  For each template, determine its outer border color and record its complete pattern (the shape and colors of the border and its interior content) relative to its top-left corner. Store these templates (outer color -> pattern map).\n3.  **Fragment Identification (Lower Region):**\n    a.  Examine the input grid's lower region (rows 7-29).\n    b.  Identify all \"fragments,\" which are contiguous blocks of any single color *except* white (0).\n    c.  For each fragment, record its color and the coordinates of its top-left-most pixel.\n4.  **Transformation (Lower Region):**\n    a.  Iterate through all identified fragments from the lower region (the order might matter if template placements overlap, but assume for now based on examples that overlaps are handled by simple overwrite, perhaps processing fragments top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n    b.  For the current fragment, check if its color matches the outer border color of any template identified in step 2.\n    c.  If a match is found:\n        i.  Retrieve the complete pattern associated with the matching template.\n        ii. In the *output grid*, starting at the fragment's recorded top-left coordinates, overwrite the existing pixels with the pixels from the template's complete pattern.\n5.  **Finalization:** The modified output grid is the result. (Note: Step 1 already copied the upper region, which is not modified further)."
