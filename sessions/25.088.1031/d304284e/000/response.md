*   **Perception**:
    *   The input grid contains a single connected object of a specific color (orange, 7) on a white background (0). The object's shape varies between examples ('A' shape in train_1, 'B' shape in train_2).
    *   The output grid shows the original object tiled across a portion of the grid, starting from the original object's position and extending downwards and to the right.
    *   Each tiled copy is separated from its neighbors by a 1-pixel border of the white background color.
    *   The color of the tiled copies alternates based on their horizontal position in the tiling pattern. Specifically, the first two copies in each row retain the original color (orange, 7), the third copy is magenta (6), and this pattern (orange, orange, magenta) repeats horizontally. The vertical position does not affect the color.
    *   The tiling continues as long as the full copy (including padding) fits within the grid boundaries.

*   **YAML Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_size: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
      background_color: white (0)
      objects_present: Exactly one non-background object in the input.

    input_object:
      property: single_connected_component
      color: original_color (e.g., orange/7 in examples)
      shape: specific pattern (e.g., 'A', 'B')
      location: defined by its bounding box (top_left_row, top_left_col)
      size: defined by its bounding box (height, width)

    transformation:
      type: tiling
      pattern: repeating the input_object shape
      placement:
        start_position: uses the input_object's top_left coordinates
        direction: downwards and rightwards
        padding: 1 pixel of background_color between adjacent tiles (horizontally and vertically)
        boundary: stops tiling if a tile would extend beyond the grid limits
      color_modification:
        rule: based on horizontal tile index (0-based)
        pattern:
          - if (index + 1) % 3 == 0: use magenta (6)
          - else: use original_color
        scope: applies horizontally; vertical position does not affect color change

    output_grid:
      content: tiled pattern overlayed on the background color
      elements: multiple copies of the input object shape with potentially modified colors
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the single contiguous non-white object in the input grid.
    2.  Determine its `original_color`, its shape (as a pattern relative to its top-left corner), and its bounding box (top-left row `R0`, top-left column `C0`, height `H`, width `W`).
    3.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the white background color (0).
    4.  Iterate through potential tile placements using row index `j` (starting from 0) and column index `i` (starting from 0).
    5.  For each pair `(j, i)`, calculate the top-left corner `(R, C)` for placing a tile: `R = R0 + j * (H + 1)`, `C = C0 + i * (W + 1)`.
    6.  Check if the tile fits within the grid: `R + H <= grid_height` and `C + W <= grid_width`.
    7.  If the tile fits:
        a.  Determine the color for this tile based on the horizontal index `i`. If `(i + 1)` is a multiple of 3, the `tile_color` is magenta (6). Otherwise, the `tile_color` is the `original_color`.
        b.  Place the object's shape onto the output grid at the calculated position `(R, C)`, using the determined `tile_color` for the object's pixels.
    8.  Continue iterating through `j` and `i` until tiles no longer fit within the grid boundaries.
    9.  Return the completed output grid.
