The object's shape varies between examples ('A' shape in train_1, 'B' shape in train_2).\n    *   The output grid shows the original object tiled across a portion of the grid, starting from the original object's position and extending downwards and to the right.\n    *   Each tiled copy is separated from its neighbors by a 1-pixel border of the white background color.\n    *   The color of the tiled copies alternates based on their horizontal position in the tiling pattern. Specifically, the first two copies in each row retain the original color (orange, 7), the third copy is magenta (6), and this pattern (orange, orange, magenta) repeats horizontally. The vertical position does not affect the color.\n    *   The tiling continues as long as the full copy (including padding) fits within the grid boundaries.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
