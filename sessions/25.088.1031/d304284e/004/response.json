            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully identified the single non-background object, its properties (color, shape, bounding box), and the tiling pattern (starting position, spacing). However, it incorrectly determined the color rule for the tiled objects. The code assumed that all tiles after the first row (j > 0) should be magenta (6).\n\nAnalysis of the two examples reveals a more nuanced color rule:\n1.  The color rule depends on both the tile's row index (`j`, 0-based) and its column index (`i`, 0-based).\n2.  The condition `(i + 1) % 3 == 0` determines *when* the color should be magenta (6).\n3.  The color used *when the condition is false* depends on the tile row index `j`:\n    *   If `j == 0` (first row of tiles), the original object's color is used.\n    *   If `j > 0` (subsequent rows of tiles), the background color (white, 0) is used.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the color selection logic within the tiling loop to implement this refined rule.\n\n## Metrics\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 23x28\n*   Object: 'H' shape\n*   Object Color: Orange (7)\n*   Object Bounding Box: min_row=4, min_col=5, max_row=8, max_col=7\n*   Object Height: 5\n*   Object Width: 3\n*   Output Grid Size: 23x28\n*   Tiling Origin: (4, 5) (Same as input object top-left)\n*   Tiling Spacing: 1 pixel white border (Tile starts every Height+1 rows and Width+1 columns)\n*   Row 0 Tile Colors (i=0..5): Orange, Orange, Magenta, Orange, Orange, Magenta\n*   Row > 0 Tile Colors (i=0..5): White, White, Magenta, White, White, Magenta\n*   Code Output Mismatch: Incorrectly colored tiles in rows j > 0 where (i+1)%3 != 0 as Magenta instead of White.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 23x28\n*   Object: '0' shape\n*   Object Color: Orange (7)\n*   Object Bounding Box: min_row=5, min_col=3, max_row=7, max_col=5\n*   Object Height: 3\n*   Object Width: 3\n*   Output Grid Size: 23x28\n*   Tiling Origin: (5, 3) (Same as input object top-left)\n*   Tiling Spacing: 1 pixel white border (Tile starts every Height+1 rows and Width+1 columns)\n*   Row 0 Tile Colors (i=0..6): Orange, Orange, Magenta, Orange, Orange, Magenta, Orange (partial)\n*   Row > 0 Tile Colors (i=0..6): White, White, Magenta, White, White, Magenta, White (partial)\n*   Code Output Mismatch: Incorrectly colored tiles in rows j > 0 where (i+1)%3 != 0 as Magenta instead of White.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Find the single contiguous non-background object in the input grid.\n  2. Identify its color (original_color), coordinates, and calculate its bounding box (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c).\n  3. Determine the object's height (obj_height = max_r - min_r + 1) and width (obj_width = max_c - min_c + 1).\n  4. Extract the object's shape relative to its top-left corner (relative_shape).\n  5. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0).\n  6. Iterate through potential tile row starting positions:\n     - `start_r = min_r + j * (obj_height + 1)` where `j` starts at 0 and increments.\n     - Break the outer loop if `start_r >= grid_height`.\n  7. For each `j`, iterate through potential tile column starting positions:\n     - `start_c = min_c + i * (obj_width + 1)` where `i` starts at 0 and increments.\n     - Break the inner loop if `start_c >= grid_width`.\n  8. Check if the current tile fits completely within the grid boundaries:\n     - `fits = (start_r + obj_height <= grid_height) and (start_c + obj_width <= grid_width)`\n  9. If the tile fits:\n     - Determine the `tile_color`:\n       - If `(i + 1) % 3 == 0`: `tile_color = highlight_color` (magenta, 6)\n       - Else (if `(i + 1) % 3 != 0`):\n         - If `j == 0`: `tile_color = original_color`\n         - If `j > 0`: `tile_color = background_color` (white, 0)\n     - Place the object's `relative_shape` onto the output grid at `(start_r, start_c)` using the determined `tile_color`.\n  10.

Determine its color (`original_color`), shape, and the coordinates of its top-left corner (`min_r`, `min_c`). Also, determine its height (`obj_height`) and width (`obj_width`).\n2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).\n3.  Starting from the `min_r`, `min_c` position, repeatedly place copies (tiles) of the identified object's shape onto the output grid.\n4.  Arrange the tiles in rows and columns. Leave a one-pixel white border between adjacent tiles, both horizontally and vertically. (The next tile down starts `obj_height + 1` pixels below the previous row's start; the next tile right starts `obj_width + 1` pixels to the right of the previous column's start).\n5.  Continue tiling downwards and rightwards as long as the *entire* tile fits within the output grid boundaries.\n6.  Determine the color of each placed tile based on its position in the tiling grid (using 0-based row index `j` and 0-based column index `i`):\n    *   If the tile is in the first row of tiles (`j == 0`):\n        *   If the tile's column index plus one (`i + 1`) is divisible by 3, color the tile magenta (6).\n        *   Otherwise, color the tile using the `original_color` identified in step 1.\n    *   If the tile is in any subsequent row (`j > 0`):\n        *   If the tile's column index plus one (`i + 1`) is divisible by 3, color the tile magenta (6).\n        *   Otherwise, color the tile white (0, the background color).\n7.
