"""
Identify the single contiguous non-white object in the input grid.
Determine its original color, shape, and bounding box (top-left corner, height, width).
Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
Tile the identified object's shape across the output grid, starting from the 
original object's top-left position.
Tiles are placed downwards and rightwards, separated by a 1-pixel white border.
The color of each tile depends on its tile row index ('j') and tile column index ('i'), both 0-based:
- If j == 0 (first row of tiles): 
    - If (i + 1) is a multiple of 3, the tile color is magenta (6).
    - Otherwise, the tile color is the original object's color.
- If j > 0 (subsequent rows of tiles): 
    - The tile color is always magenta (6).
Tiling stops when a tile would extend beyond the grid boundaries.
