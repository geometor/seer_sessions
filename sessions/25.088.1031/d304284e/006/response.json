            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code successfully identifies the single non-white object and attempts to tile it across the output grid based on the pattern observed in the first training example. However, the results for the training examples show discrepancies, primarily related to how tiles are drawn near the grid boundaries and potentially the color assignment rule in rows below the first.\n\n*   **Example 1 Mismatch:** 4 pixels are incorrect. The expected output includes pixels from a tile row (`j=3`) that would start at row index 22. The original object is 5 pixels high. The code checks if the *entire* tile (`22` to `22+5-1=26`) fits within the grid height (23, indices 0-22). Since `26 >= 23`, the code doesn't draw this tile row. The expected output, however, *does* show the top part of this tile row (pixels at row 22), suggesting that tiles should be drawn partially if they overlap the boundary (clipping).\n*   **Example 2 Mismatch:** 13 pixels are incorrect. Similar boundary issues occur. The expected output shows partial tiles drawn at the right edge (`i=6`) and bottom edge (`j=4`) where the full tile would extend beyond the grid dimensions. The code's requirement for the full tile to fit prevents these partial tiles from being drawn.\n\nThe core strategy should be to adjust the drawing logic to handle boundary clipping: iterate through each pixel of a potential tile, check if that specific pixel's coordinates are within the grid bounds, and draw it only if it is. The color rule seems mostly correct but needs careful re-verification against the expected outputs, especially concerning the magenta tiles.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's verify the properties and tiling parameters for each example.\n\n"
