task_context:
  description: The task involves identifying a single contiguous non-white object in the input grid and using its shape as a tile to fill the output grid.
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - output_grid_size: same as input grid size.
input_objects:
  - object_description: The single contiguous non-white object.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the object pixels (e.g., orange (7)).
      - shape: The relative coordinates of the object pixels.
      - location: The top-left coordinate (min_row, min_col) of the object's bounding box.
      - size: The height and width of the object's bounding box.
actions:
  - action: Identify the single non-white object.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: object_color, object_shape, object_location, object_size
  - action: Initialize an output grid.
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input grid.
      - fill_value: white (0).
  - action: Tile the output grid with the identified object's shape.
    parameters:
      - start_position: The original object's location (top-left corner).
      - spacing: 1 pixel of white (0) between adjacent tiles (horizontally and vertically).
      - iteration: Place tiles row by row (top to bottom), then column by column (left to right) within each row. Tile indices (i, j) are 0-based, representing column and row respectively.
      - termination: Stop tiling when a tile would extend beyond the grid boundaries.
      - color_rule:
          description: Determines the color of each placed tile based on its tile indices (i, j) and the original object's color.

final_output: The fully tiled output grid.
