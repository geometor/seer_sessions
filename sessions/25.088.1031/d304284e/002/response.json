            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code correctly identified the single non-white object, its shape, and its original position in both examples. It also correctly implemented the tiling logic: repeating the object's shape across the grid starting from the original position, moving down and right, with a 1-pixel white border between tiles.\n\nHowever, the code failed because the logic for determining the *color* of each tile was incorrect. The initial hypothesis, based only on the first example's first row of tiles, assumed the color depended solely on the column index (`i`) of the tile (`(i+1)%3 == 0` yields magenta, otherwise original color).\n\nAnalysis of the expected outputs for *both* examples reveals a different color rule. The color depends on both the tile's row index (`j`) and column index (`i`):\n1.  If the tile is in the first row (`j == 0`), the color is magenta (6) if its column index `i` satisfies `(i+1) % 3 == 0`, otherwise it's the original object's color.\n2.  If the tile is in any subsequent row (`j > 0`), the color is always magenta (6), regardless of the column index `i`.\n\nThe strategy to resolve the errors is to update the color assignment logic within the tiling loop to implement this revised rule.\n\n## Metrics\n\nNo specific code execution is required to gather the core metrics, as the object identification and tiling placement were visually confirmed as correct in the failed outputs. The key discrepancies are related to the color assignment rule, which has been deduced by comparing the failed outputs with the expected outputs across both examples.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 23x28\n*   Input Object: 'H' shape, Orange (7), Bounding Box (approx): (4, 5) to (8, 7) (5x3 size).\n*   Output Grid Size: 23x28\n*   Tiling: Starts at (4, 5), repeats 5x3 shape with 1-pixel white border.\n*   Color Rule (Deduced): Magenta (6) if tile row `j > 0` OR if `j=0` and `(i+1)%3 == 0`. Otherwise Orange (7).\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 23x28\n*   Input Object: '0' shape, Orange (7), Bounding Box (approx): (5, 3) to (7, 5) (3x3 size).\n*   Output Grid Size: 23x28\n*   Tiling: Starts at (5, 3), repeats 3x3 shape with 1-pixel white border.\n*   Color Rule (Deduced): Magenta (6) if tile row `j > 0` OR if `j=0` and `(i+1)%3 == 0`. Otherwise Orange (7).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the white color (0).\n3.  Iterate through potential tile placements, starting from the original object's position (`min_r`, `min_c`). Use a row tile index `j` (starting at 0) and a column tile index `i` (starting at 0).\n4.  For each potential tile placement (`i`, `j`):\n    a.  Calculate the top-left corner (`start_r`, `start_c`) where the tile would be placed:\n        *   `start_r = min_r + j * (obj_height + 1)`\n        *   `start_c = min_c + i * (obj_width + 1)`\n    b.
