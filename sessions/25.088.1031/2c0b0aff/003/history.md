"""
Identifies distinct rectangular objects composed solely of azure (8) and green (3) pixels against a white (0) background in the input grid.
Counts the number of such valid objects found (n).

If n = 4:
  Selects the object with the highest ratio of green pixels to total pixels (green + azure).

If n = 3:
  Compares the object with the smallest total area (ObjMinArea) and the object with the largest total area (ObjMaxArea).
  Calculates the ratio of green pixels to azure pixels for both (RatioMin, RatioMax).
  Selects the object whose ratio is closest to 1/3 (minimizes abs(Ratio - 1/3)).
  In case of a tie in closeness, selects the object with the larger area (ObjMaxArea).

The output grid is an exact copy of the selected object's pixels.

This confirms Object C is selected for Example 4 with the new rule, matching the expected output.

The analysis strongly suggests the rule for n=3 needs to be updated. The rule for n=4 seems correct.

Final check on n=4 rule again: max (green / total area).
Example 1: G/Area ratios: A=0.328, B=0.3125, C=0.344, D=0.297. Max is C (BL object). Expected output is BL object. Correct.
Example 2: G/Area ratios: A=0.25, B=0.236, C=0.264, D=0.278. Max is D (BR object). Expected output is BR object. Correct.

Okay, the refined understanding seems consistent across all examples now.## General Assessment

The provided code successfully solves 3 out of 4 training examples. The core logic for identifying valid rectangular objects composed of green (3) and azure (8) pixels appears correct. The discrepancy arises in Example 3, where the implemented selection rule for cases with exactly 3 valid objects (n=3) yields a different output than expected. The rule for n=4 cases seems correct based on Examples 1 and 2.

The failure in Example 3 indicates that the initial hypothesis for the n=3 selection rule (comparing min/max area objects based on green/azure ratio closeness to 1/3) was incorrect or incomplete. The strategy is to re-analyze the properties of the objects in the n=3 examples (3 and 4) to find the correct selection criterion that distinguishes the expected output object.

## Metrics and Analysis

The task involves identifying rectangular objects composed solely of green (3) and azure (8) pixels on a white (0) background. A selection rule is applied based on the number (n) of such objects found.

**Object Definition:** A rectangular area containing only green (3) and azure (8) pixels, connected to other non-white pixels but forming a solid rectangle of green/azure.

**Analysis per Example:**

*   **Example 1 (n=4):**
    *   Found 4 objects (TL, TR, BL, BR), all 8x8 (Area=64).
    *   Rule applied: Select object with max (Green Count / Total Area).
    *   Calculated Ratios (G/Area): TL=0.328, TR=0.3125, **BL=0.344**, BR=0.297.
    *   Code selected: Object BL.
    *   Expected Output: Object BL.
    *   Result: **Match**.

*   **Example 2 (n=4):**
    *   Found 4 objects (TL, TR, BL, BR), all 8x9 (Area=72).
    *   Rule applied: Select object with max (Green Count / Total Area).
    *   Calculated Ratios (G/Area): TL=0.25, TR=0.236, BL=0.264, **BR=0.278**.
    *   Code selected: Object BR.
    *   Expected Output: Object BR.
    *   Result: **Match**.

*   **Example 3 (n=3):**
    *   Found 3 objects: A (TL, Area=64), B (TR, Area=64), C (Bot, Area=80).
    *   Initial Rule Applied (Code): Compare min area (A or B) and max area (C) objects based on closeness of (Green Count / Azure Count) ratio to 1/3. Select closest, tie goes to max area.
        *   Ratio G/A: A≈0.185 (Diff from 1/3 ≈ 0.148), B≈0.455 (Diff from 1/3 ≈ 0.122), C=0.25 (Diff from 1/3 ≈ 0.083).
        *   Comparing A vs C: C is closer.
        *   Comparing B vs C: C is closer.
        *   Code selected: Object C.
    *   Expected Output: Object B.
    *   Result: **Mismatch**.
    *   Revised Rule Hypothesis: Select the object whose (Green Count / Azure Count) ratio is closest to 0.5.
        *   Ratio G/A: A≈0.185 (Diff from 0.5 ≈ 0.315), **B≈0.455 (Diff from 0.5 ≈ 0.045)**, C=0.25 (Diff from 0.5 = 0.250).
        *   Selection based on min diff from 0.5: Object B. This matches the expected output.

*   **Example 4 (n=3):**
    *   Found 3 objects: A (TL, Area=35), B (TR, Area=64), C (BL, Area=88).
    *   Initial Rule Applied (Code): Compare min area (A) and max area (C) objects based on closeness of (Green Count / Azure Count) ratio to 1/3. Select closest, tie goes to max area.
        *   Ratio G/A: A≈0.522 (Diff from 1/3 ≈ 0.188), B≈0.455 (Diff from 1/3 ≈ 0.122), C≈0.517 (Diff from 1/3 ≈ 0.184).
        *   Comparing A vs C: C is closer (0.184 < 0.188).
        *   Code selected: Object C.
    *   Expected Output: Object C.
    *   Result: **Match**. (The old rule happened to work here).
    *   Revised Rule Hypothesis: Select the object whose (Green Count / Azure Count) ratio is closest to 0.5.
        *   Ratio G/A: A≈0.522 (Diff from 0.5 ≈ 0.022), B≈0.455 (Diff from 0.5 ≈ 0.045), **C≈0.517 (Diff from 0.5 ≈ 0.017)**.
        *   Selection based on min diff from 0.5: Object C. This also matches the expected output.

**Conclusion:** The revised rule for n=3 (select object with Green/Azure ratio closest to 0.5) correctly explains the expected output for both Example 3 and Example 4. The rule for n=4 (select object with max Green/Total Area ratio) remains consistent.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
task_context:
  problem_description: Identify specific rectangular objects composed of green and azure pixels within a larger grid containing a white background, and select one object based on rules determined by the count of such objects.
  input_grid_description: A 2D grid containing pixels of white(0), green(3), and azure(8). Objects are contiguous rectangular blocks made solely of green and azure.
  output_grid_description: A 2D grid representing a copy of the single selected object.

identified_objects:
  - object_type: rectangular_area
    properties:
      - composition: consists only of green (3) and azure (8) pixels
      - contiguity: forms a solid rectangle (no holes of background color within its bounding box)
      - background: surrounded by white (0) pixels or grid boundaries
    count_dependency: The selection rule depends on the number (n) of these objects found in the input grid.

transformation_rules:
  - rule_condition: Number of valid objects (n) = 4
    action:
      - calculate property: For each object, compute the ratio R = (count of green pixels) / (total area of the object).
      - select: Choose the object with the maximum value of R.
      - output: Return the grid corresponding to the selected object.
  - rule_condition: Number of valid objects (n) = 3
    action:
      - calculate property: For each object, compute the ratio R = (count of green pixels) / (count of azure pixels). Handle division by zero if azure count is 0 (treat ratio as infinity if green count > 0, else 0).
      - calculate property: For each object, compute the absolute difference D = |R - 0.5|.
      - select: Choose the object with the minimum value of D.
      - tie_breaking: If multiple objects have the same minimum difference, the examples do not clearly define a tie-breaker (though none occurred in the training set). Assume the first object encountered with the minimum difference is selected, or potentially one based on area or position if needed.
      - output: Return the grid corresponding to the selected object.

validation_notes:
  - The initial rule for n=3 (comparing min/max area objects based on ratio closeness to 1/3) failed on Example 3.
  - The revised rule for n=3 (selecting object with Green/Azure ratio closest to 0.5) successfully explains Examples 3 and 4.
  - The rule for n=4 (selecting object with max Green/Total Area ratio) successfully explains Examples 1 and 2.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Scan** the input grid to identify all distinct, contiguous, rectangular objects composed exclusively of green (3) and azure (8) pixels. Ensure these objects are solid rectangles (no white background pixels within their bounding box).
2.  **Count** the number of valid objects found (let this count be 'n').
3.  **Apply Selection Rule based on 'n':**
    *   **If n = 4:**
        *   For each of the four objects, calculate the ratio: `(number of green pixels) / (total number of pixels in the object)`.
        *   Select the object that has the highest calculated ratio.
    *   **If n = 3:**
        *   For each of the three objects, calculate the ratio: `(number of green pixels) / (number of azure pixels)`. (If the azure pixel count is zero, treat the ratio as infinity if green pixels exist, otherwise 0).
        *   Calculate the absolute difference between this ratio and 0.5 for each object: `abs(ratio - 0.5)`.
        *   Select the object that has the smallest calculated difference. (Assume no ties in minimum difference based on examples).
    *   **If n is not 3 or 4:** The behavior is undefined based on the examples (potentially return an empty grid or error).
4.  **Output** the grid corresponding to the selected object. The output grid should be an exact copy of the pixels of the chosen rectangular object.
