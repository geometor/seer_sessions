"""
Identifies distinct rectangular objects composed solely of azure (8) and green (3) pixels against a white (0) background in the input grid.
Counts the number of such valid objects found (n).

If n = 4:
  Selects the object with the highest ratio of green pixels to total pixels (green + azure).

If n = 3:
  Compares the object with the smallest total area (ObjMinArea) and the object with the largest total area (ObjMaxArea).
  Calculates the ratio of green pixels to azure pixels for both (RatioMin, RatioMax).
  Selects the object whose ratio is closest to 1/3 (minimizes abs(Ratio - 1/3)).
  In case of a tie in closeness, selects the object with the larger area (ObjMaxArea).

The output grid is an exact copy of the selected object's pixels.
