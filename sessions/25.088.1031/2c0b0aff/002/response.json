The rule for n=4 seems correct.\n\nFinal check on n=4 rule again: max (green / total area).\nExample 1: G/Area ratios: A=0.328, B=0.3125, C=0.344, D=0.297. Max is C (BL object). Expected output is BL object. Correct.\nExample 2: G/Area ratios: A=0.25, B=0.236, C=0.264, D=0.278. Max is D (BR object). Expected output is BR object. Correct.\n\nOkay, the refined understanding seems consistent across all examples now.## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code successfully solves 3 out of 4 training examples. The core logic for identifying valid rectangular objects composed of green (3) and azure (8) pixels appears correct. The discrepancy arises in Example 3, where the implemented selection rule for cases with exactly 3 valid objects (n=3) yields a different output than expected. The rule for n=4 cases seems correct based on Examples 1 and 2.\n\nThe failure in Example 3 indicates that the initial hypothesis for the n=3 selection rule (comparing min/max area objects based on green/azure ratio closeness to 1/3) was incorrect or incomplete. The strategy is to re-analyze the properties of the objects in the n=3 examples (3 and 4) to find the correct selection criterion that distinguishes the expected output object.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nThe task involves identifying rectangular objects composed solely of green (3) and azure (8) pixels on a white (0) background. A selection rule is applied based on the number (n) of such objects found.\n\n**Object Definition:** A rectangular area containing only green (3) and azure (8) pixels, connected to other non-white pixels but forming a solid rectangle of green/azure.\n\n**Analysis per Example:**\n\n*   **Example 1 (n=4):**\n    *   Found 4 objects (TL, TR, BL, BR), all 8x8 (Area=64).\n    *   Rule applied: Select object with max (Green Count / Total Area).\n    *   Calculated Ratios (G/Area): TL=0.328, TR=0.3125, **BL=0.344**, BR=0.297.\n    *   Code selected: Object BL.\n    *   Expected Output: Object BL.\n    *   Result: **Match**.\n\n*   **Example 2 (n=4):**\n    *   Found 4 objects (TL, TR, BL, BR), all 8x9 (Area=72).\n    *   Rule applied: Select object with max (Green Count / Total Area).\n    *   Calculated Ratios (G/Area): TL=0.25, TR=0.236, BL=0.264, **BR=0.278**.\n    *   Code selected: Object BR.\n    *   Expected Output: Object BR.\n    *   Result: **Match**.\n\n*   **Example 3 (n=3):**\n    *   Found 3 objects: A (TL, Area=64), B (TR, Area=64), C (Bot, Area=80).\n    *   Initial Rule Applied (Code): Compare min area (A or B) and max area (C) objects based on closeness of (Green Count / Azure Count) ratio to 1/3. Select closest, tie goes to max area.\n        *   Ratio G/A: A\u22480.185 (Diff from 1/3 \u2248 0.148), B\u22480.455 (Diff from 1/3 \u2248 0.122), C=0.25 (Diff from 1/3 \u2248 0.083).\n        *   Comparing A vs C: C is closer.\n        *   Comparing B vs C: C is closer.\n        *   Code selected: Object C.\n    *   Expected Output: Object B.\n    *   Result: **Mismatch**.\n    *   Revised Rule Hypothesis: Select the object whose (Green Count / Azure Count) ratio is closest to 0.5.\n        *   Ratio G/A: A\u22480.185 (Diff from 0.5 \u2248 0.315), **B\u22480.455 (Diff from 0.5 \u2248 0.045)**, C=0.25 (Diff from 0.5 = 0.250).\n        *   Selection based on min diff from 0.5: Object B. This matches the expected output.\n\n*   **Example 4 (n=3):**\n    *   Found 3 objects: A (TL, Area=35), B (TR, Area=64), C (BL, Area=88).\n    *   Initial Rule Applied (Code): Compare min area (A) and max area (C) objects based on closeness of (Green Count / Azure Count) ratio to 1/3. Select closest, tie goes to max area.\n        *   Ratio G/A: A\u22480.522 (Diff from 1/3 \u2248 0.188), B\u22480.455 (Diff from 1/3 \u2248 0.122), C\u22480.517 (Diff from 1/3 \u2248 0.184).\n        *   Comparing A vs C: C is closer (0.184 < 0.188).\n        *   Code selected: Object C.\n    *   Expected Output: Object C.\n    *   Result: **Match**. (The old rule happened to work here).\n    *   Revised Rule Hypothesis: Select the object whose (Green Count / Azure Count) ratio is closest to 0.5.\n        *   Ratio G/A: A\u22480.522 (Diff from 0.5 \u2248 0.022), B\u22480.455 (Diff from 0.5 \u2248 0.045), **C\u22480.517 (Diff from 0.5 \u2248 0.017)**.\n        *   Selection based on min diff from 0.5: Object C. This also matches the expected output.\n\n**Conclusion:** The revised rule for n=3 (select object with Green/Azure ratio closest to 0.5) correctly explains the expected output for both Example 3 and Example 4. The rule for n=4 (select object with max Green/Total Area ratio) remains consistent.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
