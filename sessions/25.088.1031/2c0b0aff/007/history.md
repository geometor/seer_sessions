"""
Identifies distinct rectangular objects composed solely of azure (8) and green (3) pixels against a white (0) background in the input grid.
From these valid objects, selects the one with the highest ratio of green pixels to the total number of pixels (green + azure) in the object.
The output grid is an exact copy of the selected object's pixels.
If multiple objects share the maximum ratio, the behavior is currently undefined by the examples, but the implementation will select the first one encountered during the scan (typically top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
If no such valid objects are found, returns a 1x1 white (0) grid.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   The code correctly identified three valid rectangular objects (Obj_1, Obj_2, Obj_3) composed of green and azure pixels in Example 4.
*   **Obj_1:** 5x7, Green Ratio = 0.3429
*   **Obj_2:** 8x8, Green Ratio = 0.3438 (Highest)
*   **Obj_3:** 8x11, Green Ratio = 0.2614
*   The **actual output** matches **Obj_2**, which is consistent with the code's logic of selecting the object with the highest green ratio (0.3438 > 0.3429 > 0.2614).
*   The **expected output** matches **Obj_3**, which has the *lowest* green ratio.

**Conclusion:** The original hypothesis (select object with the highest green ratio) is incorrect based on Example 4. The correct rule seems to be selecting the object with the *lowest* ratio of green pixels to total pixels.

Let's re-check this hypothesis against the successful examples (1, 2, 3). We need to calculate the ratios for the objects in those examples.

```
**Assessment:**

The initial assessment based only on Example 4 (selecting the object with the *lowest* green ratio) is also incorrect. The results from Examples 1 and 3 show that the expected output does *not* correspond to the object with the minimum green ratio. In Example 1, the expected output (Obj_4) has the highest ratio (0.3750). In Example 3, the expected output (Obj_2) has the highest ratio (0.3281). Example 2 is inconclusive as the expected output couldn't be matched by shape/location (possibly a typo in my `expected_output_bboxes_top_left` guess for Ex2, let's re-check the output).

Let's revisit Example 2's expected output:

```
8 8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8   <- 8x9 grid
8 3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3
8 8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8
3 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 8
8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8 3
3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 8
8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8 8
8 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 8
```

This corresponds to the object found at BBox (12, 1, 19, 9), which is Obj_3 in the code output. Its green ratio is 0.3333.

Now let's summarize the correct object selection and its green ratio for all examples:

*   **Ex 1:** Expected = Obj_4, Ratio = 0.3750 (Highest)
*   **Ex 2:** Expected = Obj_3, Ratio = 0.3333 (Highest)
*   **Ex 3:** Expected = Obj_2, Ratio = 0.3281 (Highest)
*   **Ex 4:** Expected = Obj_3, Ratio = 0.2614 (Lowest)

This contradicts the idea of a simple max or min green ratio selection. There must be another property or rule determining the selection.

Let's re-examine the properties:
*   Ex 1: Obj_4 (7x8), Ratio=0.3750. Others: Obj_1(5x8, 0.3000), Obj_2(7x7, 0.2449), Obj_3(10x9, 0.2667)
*   Ex 2: Obj_3 (8x9), Ratio=0.3333. Others: Obj_1(7x9, 0.2857), Obj_2(9x10, 0.2778), Obj_4(8x11, 0.2727)
*   Ex 3: Obj_2 (8x8), Ratio=0.3281. Others: Obj_1(8x8, 0.1719), Obj_3(8x10, 0.1500)
*   Ex 4: Obj_3 (8x11), Ratio=0.2614. Others: Obj_1(5x7, 0.3429), Obj_2(8x8, 0.3438)

Hypotheses:
1.  Is it related to size (area)? Ex1: 56 (exp) vs 40, 49, 90. Ex2: 72 (exp) vs 63, 90, 88. Ex3: 64 (exp) vs 64, 80. Ex4: 88 (exp) vs 35, 64. No obvious pattern (largest, smallest, closest to average).
2.  Is it related to the *number* of green pixels? Ex1: 21 (exp) vs 12, 12, 24. Ex2: 24 (exp) vs 18, 25, 24. Ex3: 21 (exp) vs 11, 12. Ex4: 23 (exp) vs 12, 22. No obvious max/min pattern.
3.  Is it related to the *number* of azure pixels? Ex1: 35 (exp) vs 28, 37, 66. Ex2: 48 (exp) vs 45, 65, 64. Ex3: 43 (exp) vs 53, 68. Ex4: 65 (exp) vs 23, 42. No obvious max/min pattern.
4.  Could it be the ratio of *azure* to total? (A/T)
    *   Ex 1: Obj_4 A/T = 35/56 = 0.625 (Min). Others: 0.700, 0.755, 0.733.
    *   Ex 2: Obj_3 A/T = 48/72 = 0.667 (Min). Others: 0.714, 0.722, 0.727.
    *   Ex 3: Obj_2 A/T = 43/64 = 0.6719 (Min). Others: 0.8281, 0.8500.
    *   Ex 4: Obj_3 A/T = 65/88 = 0.7386 (Max). Others: 0.6571, 0.6563.

Okay, this doesn't work either. It seems to be minimum Azure ratio for Ex1, 2, 3, but maximum for Ex 4.

Let's reconsider the green ratio (G/T).
*   Ex 1: 0.3750 (Max)
*   Ex 2: 0.3333 (Max)
*   Ex 3: 0.3281 (Max)
*   Ex 4: 0.2614 (Min)

This is strange. Why would it be maximum for the first three and minimum for the last one? Is there something fundamentally different about Example 4?

Looking at the object properties again for Ex 4:
*   Obj_1: 5x7, Ratio=0.3429
*   Obj_2: 8x8, Ratio=0.3438 (Max)
*   Obj_3: 8x11, Ratio=0.2614 (Min) - Expected Output

Wait, perhaps the original code *was* correct in selecting the highest green ratio, but my identification of the expected output for Ex 4 was wrong? Let's re-examine the results provided in the prompt.

Prompt Results for Ex 4:
*   Expected Output: The 8x11 grid (Obj_3)
*   Transformed Output: The 8x8 grid (Obj_2)
*   Match: False

This confirms the code selected Obj_2 (highest G/T ratio = 0.3438) while the *target* was Obj_3 (lowest G/T ratio = 0.2614).

What if the rule is: Select the object with the green ratio *closest* to 1/3 (0.3333...)?

*   Ex 1: Ratios = [0.3000, 0.2449, 0.2667, 0.3750]. Distances from 1/3: [0.0333, 0.0884, 0.0666, 0.0417]. Closest is Obj_1 (0.3000). Expected was Obj_4. -> Doesn't work.
*   Ex 2: Ratios = [0.2857, 0.2778, 0.3333, 0.2727]. Distances from 1/3: [0.0476, 0.0555, 0.0000, 0.0606]. Closest is Obj_3 (0.3333). Expected was Obj_3. -> Works.
*   Ex 3: Ratios = [0.1719, 0.3281, 0.1500]. Distances from 1/3: [0.1614, 0.0052, 0.1833]. Closest is Obj_2 (0.3281). Expected was Obj_2. -> Works.
*   Ex 4: Ratios = [0.3429, 0.3438, 0.2614]. Distances from 1/3: [0.0096, 0.0105, 0.0719]. Closest is Obj_1 (0.3429). Expected was Obj_3. -> Doesn't work.

What if the rule involves the *number* of objects found?
*   Ex 1: 4 objects found. Selected Obj_4 (Highest G/T ratio).
*   Ex 2: 4 objects found. Selected Obj_3 (Highest G/T ratio).
*   Ex 3: 3 objects found. Selected Obj_2 (Highest G/T ratio).
*   Ex 4: 3 objects found. Selected Obj_3 (Lowest G/T ratio).

**Hypothesis:** If 3 objects are found, select the one with the lowest G/T ratio. If 4 (or maybe >3?) objects are found, select the one with the highest G/T ratio.

Let's test this:
*   Ex 1: Found 4 objects. Rule -> select highest G/T ratio (Obj_4). Matches expectation.
*   Ex 2: Found 4 objects. Rule -> select highest G/T ratio (Obj_3). Matches expectation.
*   Ex 3: Found 3 objects. Rule -> select lowest G/T ratio (Obj_3, ratio 0.1500). DOES NOT match expectation (Obj_2, ratio 0.3281).

This hypothesis is also incorrect.

Let's reconsider the properties:
Maybe it's the object with the *highest number of azure pixels*?
*   Ex 1: Azure counts: [23, 37, 66, 35]. Max is Obj_3 (66). Expected was Obj_4. -> No.
*   Ex 2: Azure counts: [45, 65, 48, 64]. Max is Obj_2 (65). Expected was Obj_3. -> No.
*   Ex 3: Azure counts: [53, 43, 68]. Max is Obj_3 (68). Expected was Obj_2. -> No.
*   Ex 4: Azure counts: [23, 42, 65]. Max is Obj_3 (65). Expected was Obj_3. -> Yes.

Only works for Example 4.

Maybe the object with the *most green pixels*?
*   Ex 1: Green counts: [12, 12, 24, 21]. Max is Obj_3 (24). Expected was Obj_4. -> No.
*   Ex 2: Green counts: [18, 25, 24, 24]. Max is Obj_2 (25). Expected was Obj_3. -> No.
*   Ex 3: Green counts: [11, 21, 12]. Max is Obj_2 (21). Expected was Obj_2. -> Yes.
*   Ex 4: Green counts: [12, 22, 23]. Max is Obj_3 (23). Expected was Obj_3. -> Yes.

This works for Ex 3 and Ex 4. Let's re-check Ex 1 and 2.
*   Ex 1: Expected Obj_4 has 21 green pixels. Max was Obj_3 with 24.
*   Ex 2: Expected Obj_3 has 24 green pixels. Max was Obj_2 with 25.

This doesn't seem right either. Is there a possibility the object finding logic is slightly off? The definition requires solid rectangles of *only* green and azure. The BFS finds connected components of non-background, checks they only contain green/azure, then checks if they fill their bounding box. This seems robust.

What if the selection criteria involves multiple steps or combinations?

Let's assume the object identification is correct. The only difference between the examples where "max green ratio" worked (1, 2, 3) and the one where it failed (4) is that in Example 4, the object with the lowest green ratio was selected.

Is there any other distinguishing feature?
Maybe the dimensions?
*   Ex 1: Select 7x8. Others 5x8, 7x7, 10x9.
*   Ex 2: Select 8x9. Others 7x9, 9x10, 8x11.
*   Ex 3: Select 8x8. Others 8x8, 8x10.
*   Ex 4: Select 8x11. Others 5x7, 8x8.

Is it the object with the largest width?
*   Ex 1: Widths [8, 7, 9, 8]. Max width is 9 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_4 (width 8). -> No.
*   Ex 2: Widths [9, 10, 9, 11]. Max width is 11 (Obj_4). Selected Obj_3 (width 9). -> No.
*   Ex 3: Widths [8, 8, 10]. Max width is 10 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_2 (width 8). -> No.
*   Ex 4: Widths [7, 8, 11]. Max width is 11 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_3 (width 11). -> Yes.

Only works for Ex 4. Largest height?
*   Ex 1: Heights [5, 7, 10, 7]. Max height is 10 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_4 (height 7). -> No.
*   Ex 2: Heights [7, 9, 8, 8]. Max height is 9 (Obj_2). Selected Obj_3 (height 8). -> No.
*   Ex 3: Heights [8, 8, 8]. Max height is 8 (All). Selected Obj_2 (height 8). -> Maybe (tie).
*   Ex 4: Heights [5, 8, 8]. Max height is 8 (Obj_2, Obj_3). Selected Obj_3 (height 8). -> Maybe (tie).

Largest Area?
*   Ex 1: Areas [40, 49, 90, 56]. Max area is 90 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_4 (area 56). -> No.
*   Ex 2: Areas [63, 90, 72, 88]. Max area is 90 (Obj_2). Selected Obj_3 (area 72). -> No.
*   Ex 3: Areas [64, 64, 80]. Max area is 80 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_2 (area 64). -> No.
*   Ex 4: Areas [35, 64, 88]. Max area is 88 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_3 (area 88). -> Yes.

Largest Area only works for Ex 4.

This is proving difficult. Let's assume the simplest case failed: maximum green ratio. What was the error in Ex 4? The code picked Obj_2 (8x8, ratio 0.3438) instead of Obj_3 (8x11, ratio 0.2614).

Is there *any* simple metric where Obj_3 ranks highest or lowest uniquely in Ex 4?
*   Lowest Green Ratio: Yes (0.2614)
*   Highest Azure Ratio: Yes (0.7386)
*   Highest Azure Count: Yes (65)
*   Highest Green Count: Yes (23)
*   Largest Width: Yes (11)
*   Largest Area: Yes (88)

Okay, for Ex 4, the target object (Obj_3) has the lowest green ratio, highest azure ratio, highest azure count, highest green count, largest width, and largest area.

Now, which of these properties *also* selects the correct object in Ex 1, 2, 3?

*   **Lowest Green Ratio:** Failed Ex 1, 2, 3.
*   **Highest Azure Ratio:** Failed Ex 1, 2, 3.
*   **Highest Azure Count:** Failed Ex 1, 2, 3.
*   **Highest Green Count:** Failed Ex 1, 2. Worked Ex 3.
*   **Largest Width:** Failed Ex 1, 2, 3.
*   **Largest Area:** Failed Ex 1, 2, 3.

This implies the rule is more complex or my object identification/property calculation missed something. Let's review the object definition and finding:
- Find connected components of non-background (non-0) colors using 4-connectivity.
- Check if all pixels in the component are *only* green (3) or azure (8).
- Check if the component perfectly fills its bounding box (is rectangular).

This seems correct and the code implements it. The metrics seem correct too.

What if the tie-breaking in the original code was relevant? The code selects the *first* object encountered (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) if ratios are tied. Let's check for ties:
*   Ex 1: Ratios [0.3000, 0.2449, 0.2667, 0.3750]. No ties. Max is Obj_4. Correct.
*   Ex 2: Ratios [0.2857, 0.2778, 0.3333, 0.2727]. No ties. Max is Obj_3. Correct.
*   Ex 3: Ratios [0.1719, 0.3281, 0.1500]. No ties. Max is Obj_2. Correct.
*   Ex 4: Ratios [0.3429, 0.3438, 0.2614]. No ties. Max is Obj_2. Incorrect (Expected Obj_3).

The tie-breaking isn't the issue. The core selection criterion (max green ratio) is wrong for Ex 4.

Could the rule be "Select the object with the largest area, UNLESS there's an object with green ratio > X, in which case select the one with max green ratio"? No, that doesn't fit.

Let's simplify. The code identifies solid rectangular regions of Green/Azure. It then selects *one* of these regions. The selection rule worked for 3 examples (Max Green Ratio) and failed for 1 (where Min Green Ratio / Max Area / Max Width / Max Green Count / Max Azure Count etc. would have worked).

Is there any visual pattern? The selected object is always copied exactly to the output.

Could the position matter? Select the bottom-most object?
*   Ex 1: BBoxes [(2,2), (3,13), (9,1), (11,11)]. Max top_row is 11 (Obj_4). Max bottom_row is 18 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_4. -> Max top_row?
*   Ex 2: BBoxes [(1,1), (1,12), (12,1), (13,11)]. Max top_row is 13 (Obj_4). Max bottom_row is 20 (Obj_4). Selected Obj_3. -> No.
*   Ex 3: BBoxes [(3,2), (3,12), (13,8)]. Max top_row is 13 (Obj_3). Max bottom_row is 20 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_2. -> No.
*   Ex 4: BBoxes [(2,2), (2,12), (11,2)]. Max top_row is 11 (Obj_3). Max bottom_row is 18 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_3. -> Yes.

Select the object whose bounding box has the maximum `min_row` (starts lowest down)?
*   Ex 1: Max min_row = 11 (Obj_4). Selected Obj_4. -> Yes.
*   Ex 2: Max min_row = 13 (Obj_4). Selected Obj_3. -> No.
*   Ex 3: Max min_row = 13 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_2. -> No.
*   Ex 4: Max min_row = 11 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_3. -> Yes.

Select the object whose bounding box has the maximum `max_row` (ends lowest down)?
*   Ex 1: Max max_row = 18 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_4. -> No.
*   Ex 2: Max max_row = 20 (Obj_4). Selected Obj_3. -> No.
*   Ex 3: Max max_row = 20 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_2. -> No.
*   Ex 4: Max max_row = 18 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_3. -> Yes.

This is highly inconsistent. There must be a simpler property.

Let's look only at the selected objects:
*   Ex 1: Obj_4, 7x8, G/T=0.3750
*   Ex 2: Obj_3, 8x9, G/T=0.3333
*   Ex 3: Obj_2, 8x8, G/T=0.3281
*   Ex 4: Obj_3, 8x11, G/T=0.2614

Compare selected object G/T ratio to the others:
*   Ex 1: 0.3750 > [0.3000, 0.2449, 0.2667] -> Max
*   Ex 2: 0.3333 > [0.2857, 0.2778, 0.2727] -> Max
*   Ex 3: 0.3281 > [0.1719, 0.1500] -> Max
*   Ex 4: 0.2614 < [0.3429, 0.3438] -> Min

Perhaps the rule is: **Select the object with the most "extreme" green ratio (furthest from 0.5, or furthest from the average ratio, or simply maximum or minimum).**

Let's calculate distance from 0.5:
*   Ex 1: Ratios [0.3000, 0.2449, 0.2667, 0.3750]. Dist from 0.5: [0.2000, 0.2551, 0.2333, 0.1250]. Smallest distance (closest to 0.5) is Obj_4. -> Selected Obj_4. **Matches.**
*   Ex 2: Ratios [0.2857, 0.2778, 0.3333, 0.2727]. Dist from 0.5: [0.2143, 0.2222, 0.1667, 0.2273]. Smallest distance is Obj_3. -> Selected Obj_3. **Matches.**
*   Ex 3: Ratios [0.1719, 0.3281, 0.1500]. Dist from 0.5: [0.3281, 0.1719, 0.3500]. Smallest distance is Obj_2. -> Selected Obj_2. **Matches.**
*   Ex 4: Ratios [0.3429, 0.3438, 0.2614]. Dist from 0.5: [0.1571, 0.1562, 0.2386]. Smallest distance is Obj_2. -> Selected Obj_3. **FAILS.**

How about **furthest** from 0.5?
*   Ex 1: Largest distance is 0.2551 (Obj_2). Selected Obj_4. -> No.
*   Ex 2: Largest distance is 0.2273 (Obj_4). Selected Obj_3. -> No.
*   Ex 3: Largest distance is 0.3500 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_2. -> No.
*   Ex 4: Largest distance is 0.2386 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_3. -> Yes.

Okay, I seem to be going in circles. The most straightforward explanation was "maximum green ratio", which worked for 3/4. The failure on Ex 4 is the key. What if the definition of "valid object" was slightly wrong for Ex 4?

Re-check input 4 and the objects visually:
*   Obj_1: (2, 2) to (6, 8) - seems valid rect of 3/8.
*   Obj_2: (2, 12) to (9, 19) - seems valid rect of 3/8.
*   Obj_3: (11, 2) to (18, 12) - seems valid rect of 3/8.

The object finding seems correct. The selection criteria is the mystery.

Is it possible the task has ambiguity or an error? Unlikely for ARC.

Let's try the simplest modification: Maybe the ratio calculation is different? Green / Azure? Green / Width? Green / Height? No obvious reason for this.

Back to the results: Max G/T for 1, 2, 3. Min G/T for 4. What's different about 4?
It's the only example where the selected object (Obj_3) has the largest area (88).
It's the only example where the selected object (Obj_3) has the largest width (11).
It's the only example where the selected object (Obj_3) has the highest green count (23).
It's the only example where the selected object (Obj_3) has the highest azure count (65).

Could the rule be: "Select the object with the highest green ratio, UNLESS one object is uniquely largest in Area (or Width, or Green Count, or Azure Count), in which case select that largest object"?

Let's test "Largest Area" override:
*   Ex 1: Max Area Obj_3 (90). Max G/T Obj_4 (0.3750). Selected Obj_4. -> Rule: Select Max G/T as Max Area obj is different. **Matches.**
*   Ex 2: Max Area Obj_2 (90). Max G/T Obj_3 (0.3333). Selected Obj_3. -> Rule: Select Max G/T as Max Area obj is different. **Matches.**
*   Ex 3: Max Area Obj_3 (80). Max G/T Obj_2 (0.3281). Selected Obj_2. -> Rule: Select Max G/T as Max Area obj is different. **Matches.**
*   Ex 4: Max Area Obj_3 (88). Max G/T Obj_2 (0.3438). Selected Obj_3. -> Rule: Max Area obj (Obj_3) is different from Max G/T obj (Obj_2). Rule says select Max G/T (Obj_2). -> **FAILS.** (We expected Obj_3).

Let's test "Largest Width" override:
*   Ex 1: Max Width Obj_3 (9). Max G/T Obj_4 (0.3750). Selected Obj_4. -> Rule: Select Max G/T. **Matches.**
*   Ex 2: Max Width Obj_4 (11). Max G/T Obj_3 (0.3333). Selected Obj_3. -> Rule: Select Max G/T. **Matches.**
*   Ex 3: Max Width Obj_3 (10). Max G/T Obj_2 (0.3281). Selected Obj_2. -> Rule: Select Max G/T. **Matches.**
*   Ex 4: Max Width Obj_3 (11). Max G/T Obj_2 (0.3438). Selected Obj_3. -> Rule: Max Width obj (Obj_3) is different from Max G/T obj (Obj_2). Rule says select Max G/T (Obj_2). -> **FAILS.**

This override idea isn't working. The rule must be simpler. What if the ratio isn't G/T but just G? (Select object with most green pixels)
*   Ex 1: Max Green = 24 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_4. -> No.
*   Ex 2: Max Green = 25 (Obj_2). Selected Obj_3. -> No.
*   Ex 3: Max Green = 21 (Obj_2). Selected Obj_2. -> Yes.
*   Ex 4: Max Green = 23 (Obj_3). Selected Obj_3. -> Yes.

Still inconsistent.

Final check on the core logic:
1. Find *all* distinct rectangular objects containing *only* green (3) and azure (8) pixels, surrounded by background (0) or the grid edge.
2. From these valid objects, select one based on a property.
3. Output the selected object.

The analysis suggests the property is MAX(Green Ratio) for Ex 1, 2, 3 and MIN(Green Ratio) for Ex 4. This feels like a conditional rule. What condition changes between 1/2/3 and 4?

Maybe compare the MAX and MIN green ratios?
*   Ex 1: Max=0.3750 (Obj_4), Min=0.2449 (Obj_2). Selected Max.
*   Ex 2: Max=0.3333 (Obj_3), Min=0.2727 (Obj_4). Selected Max.
*   Ex 3: Max=0.3281 (Obj_2), Min=0.1500 (Obj_3). Selected Max.
*   Ex 4: Max=0.3438 (Obj_2), Min=0.2614 (Obj_3). Selected Min.

Why select Min only in Ex 4? Is the *range* of ratios different?
*   Ex 1 Range: 0.3750 - 0.2449 = 0.1301
*   Ex 2 Range: 0.3333 - 0.2727 = 0.0606
*   Ex 3 Range: 0.3281 - 0.1500 = 0.1781
*   Ex 4 Range: 0.3438 - 0.2614 = 0.0824

No obvious pattern in range.

Is the object with the MIN ratio also the MAX area object *only* in Ex4?
*   Ex 1: Min ratio Obj_2 (Area 49). Max Area Obj_3 (Area 90). No.
*   Ex 2: Min ratio Obj_4 (Area 88). Max Area Obj_2 (Area 90). No.
*   Ex 3: Min ratio Obj_3 (Area 80). Max Area Obj_3 (Area 80). Yes.
*   Ex 4: Min ratio Obj_3 (Area 88). Max Area Obj_3 (Area 88). Yes.

**New Hypothesis:** Select the object with the maximum green ratio, *unless* the object with the minimum green ratio is also the object with the maximum area, in which case select the minimum green ratio object.

Let's test:
*   Ex 1: Min ratio obj (Obj_2) != Max area obj (Obj_3). Rule -> Select Max G/T (Obj_4). **Matches.**
*   Ex 2: Min ratio obj (Obj_4) != Max area obj (Obj_2). Rule -> Select Max G/T (Obj_3). **Matches.**
*   Ex 3: Min ratio obj (Obj_3) == Max area obj (Obj_3). Rule -> Select Min G/T (Obj_3, ratio 0.1500). Expected Obj_2 (Max G/T). -> **FAILS.**
*   Ex 4: Min ratio obj (Obj_3) == Max area obj (Obj_3). Rule -> Select Min G/T (Obj_3, ratio 0.2614). Expected Obj_3. -> **Matches.**

This is *close*. It correctly flips the rule for Ex 4 but incorrectly flips it for Ex 3.

What if the condition is: Select Max G/T *unless* Min G/T object == Max *Width* object?
*   Ex 1: Min ratio (Obj_2, W=7) != Max Width (Obj_3, W=9). Rule -> Select Max G/T (Obj_4). **Matches.**
*   Ex 2: Min ratio (Obj_4, W=11) == Max Width (Obj_4, W=11). Rule -> Select Min G/T (Obj_4, 0.2727). Expected Obj_3 (Max G/T). -> **FAILS.**
*   Ex 3: Min ratio (Obj_3, W=10) == Max Width (Obj_3, W=10). Rule -> Select Min G/T (Obj_3, 0.1500). Expected Obj_2 (Max G/T). -> **FAILS.**
*   Ex 4: Min ratio (Obj_3, W=11) == Max Width (Obj_3, W=11). Rule -> Select Min G/T (Obj_3, 0.2614). Expected Obj_3. -> **Matches.**

This is also not quite right. It seems the original Max G/T rule is correct for Ex 1, 2, 3 and something specific selects Obj_3 in Ex 4. Obj_3 in Ex 4 is unique among all objects across all examples for being the largest area object AND the largest width object AND the highest green count object AND the highest azure count object within its example. Maybe the rule is simpler: Find the object with maximum green ratio. If there's a tie, use a secondary criterion? But there are no ties.

Could the problem definition in the prompt be slightly
