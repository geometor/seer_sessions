For each object, determine its color, pixel coordinates, and bounding box (min/max row/col).\n3. Find the overall minimum row and minimum column across all non-white pixels in the input grid. This determines the top-left placement coordinate in the output.\n4. Sort the identified objects based on their minimum column index (leftmost extent) in ascending order.\n5. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color (white, 0).\n6. Place the sorted objects horizontally onto the output grid, starting at the calculated overall minimum row and minimum column.\n7. Separate adjacent objects with a single column of white pixels.\n8.
