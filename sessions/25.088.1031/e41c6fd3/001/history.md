**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** Contains multiple distinct objects, each composed of connected pixels of a single non-white color. The objects are scattered across a white background. Objects may have internal "holes" (white pixels).
2.  **Output Grid:** Contains the same objects from the input grid, but rearranged. The grid dimensions remain unchanged.
3.  **Objects:** The core elements are the colored shapes (connected components of non-white pixels). Their color and shape integrity are preserved in the output.
4.  **Background:** The background is white (color 0) and remains white in the output, except where objects are placed.
5.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation is a spatial rearrangement of the input objects.
6.  **Arrangement:** In the output, objects are placed horizontally adjacent to each other, separated by a single column of white pixels.
7.  **Ordering:** The horizontal order of objects in the output is determined by the initial horizontal position (leftmost extent) of the objects in the input grid. Objects are sorted from left to right based on their minimum column index in the input.
8.  **Placement:** The entire horizontally arranged block of objects is placed onto the output grid. The top-left corner of this block is determined by the overall minimum row index and minimum column index found across *all* non-white pixels in the *input* grid. Specifically, the top row of the output block aligns with the topmost row occupied by any object in the input, and the leftmost column of the output block aligns with the leftmost column occupied by any object in the input.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all distinct connected objects composed of non-white pixels in the input grid. For each object, record its color, the coordinates of all its pixels, its minimum row index (top edge), and its minimum column index (left edge).
3.  Determine the overall minimum row index (`placement_row`) and overall minimum column index (`placement_col`) across all pixels of all identified objects in the input grid. This defines the top-left starting position for the output arrangement.
4.  Sort the identified objects based on their minimum column index (left edge) in ascending order.
5.  Set the starting column for placement in the output grid to `current_col = placement_col`.
6.  Iterate through the sorted objects:
    a.  For the current object, iterate through its pixels. For each pixel at input coordinates `(r, c)` with color `v`:
        i.  Calculate its relative row `rel_r = r - object_min_row`.
        ii. Calculate its relative column `rel_c = c - object_min_col`.
        iii. Calculate the output coordinates: `out_r = placement_row + rel_r`, `out_c = current_col + rel_c`.
        iv. Set the pixel at `(out_r, out_c)` in the output grid to color `v`.
    b.  Determine the width of the current object (`object_width = object_max_col - object_min_col + 1`).
    c.  Update the starting column for the next object: `current_col = current_col + object_width + 1` (adding 1 for the single white pixel column separator).
7.  Return the completed output grid.
