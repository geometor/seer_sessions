"""
Transforms the input grid by filling in the white (0) pixels based on a diagonal pattern.
The diagonal pattern (sequence length L and offset K) is deduced from the non-white pixels
in the input grid using the formula: color = ((row + col + K) % L) + 1.
Non-white pixels from the input grid are preserved in the output.
