Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input & Output Grids:** Both input and output grids are the same size in each example. They contain mostly non-zero colors, arranged in a clear diagonal pattern, along with some white (0) pixels in the input.
2.  **Diagonal Pattern:** There's a consistent diagonal pattern across the grids, formed by a repeating sequence of colors (e.g., 1-6, 1-7, 1-8). The color at `(row, col)` depends on `row + col`. Specifically, moving one step down and one step left (or one step up and one step right) keeps the color the same. Moving one step right or one step down advances the color in the sequence (wrapping around).
3.  **White Pixels (Input):** The input grids contain patches or areas of white (0) pixels. These white pixels disrupt the underlying diagonal pattern.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves replacing the white pixels in the input grid. The replacement color for each white pixel is determined by the color that *should* be at that position according to the consistent diagonal pattern present in the non-white areas of the grid (and fully realized in the output grid). Pixels that are not white in the input remain unchanged in the output, even if they deviate from the ideal diagonal pattern (though in these examples, non-white pixels seem to consistently follow the pattern).
5.  **Sequence Identification:** The specific sequence (e.g., 1-6, 1-7, 1-8) and its starting alignment needs to be identified to correctly fill the white pixels. This pattern appears perfectly formed in the output grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
# Define the properties of the grids and objects within them.
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width in each example.
    - background_color: White (0) acts as a special background or placeholder color in the input.
    - content_colors: Primarily colors 1 through N (where N varies per example: 6, 7, or 8), plus potentially gray (5).

Objects:
  - Type: Diagonal Pattern
    Properties:
      - colors: Forms a repeating sequence (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] or [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], etc.).
      - structure: Consistent diagonal stripes where `color = sequence[ (row + col + offset) % sequence_length ]`.
      - location: Pervades the entire grid in the output. Present in the non-white areas of the input.
  - Type: White Regions
    Properties:
      - color: White (0).
      - location: Appear as contiguous or scattered areas within the input grid only.
      - role: Mark locations where the diagonal pattern is missing or needs to be restored.

Relationships:
  - White regions in the input correspond to locations where the diagonal pattern is restored in the output.
  - Non-white pixels in the input are preserved in their original positions in the output.

Actions:
  - Identify: Determine the sequence, length, and offset of the diagonal pattern. The most reliable way is by observing the complete pattern in the output grid.
  - Replace: Iterate through the input grid. If a pixel is white (0), replace it with the color dictated by the identified diagonal pattern rule for that specific (row, col) coordinate.
  - Keep: If a pixel in the input is not white, copy its value directly to the corresponding position in the output grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Analyze the Output Pattern:** Examine the *output* grid to fully understand the intended final diagonal color pattern.
    a.  Identify the sequence of repeating colors (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Note the highest number in the sequence (`N`). The sequence length `L` is `N`.
    b.  Find the coordinates `(r_start, c_start)` of the first occurrence (top-most, then left-most) of the color `1` in the *output* grid.
    c.  Define a function `get_pattern_color(row, col)` that calculates the correct color for any coordinate based on this pattern: the color is `sequence[ ((row - r_start) + (col - c_start)) % L ]`, where the sequence is `1, 2, ..., L`.
2.  **Process the Input Grid:** Create a new grid identical in size to the input grid.
3.  **Fill the New Grid:** Iterate through each cell `(row, col)` of the *input* grid:
    a.  If the color of the input cell `input[row, col]` is white (0), then set the corresponding cell in the new grid to the color calculated by `get_pattern_color(row, col)`.
    b.  If the color of the input cell `input[row, col]` is *not* white (any non-zero color), then copy this color directly to the corresponding cell in the new grid.
4.  **Return Result:** The newly filled grid is the final output.
