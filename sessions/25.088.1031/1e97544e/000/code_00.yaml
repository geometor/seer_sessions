# Define the properties of the grids and objects within them.
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width in each example.
    - background_color: White (0) acts as a special background or placeholder color in the input.
    - content_colors: Primarily colors 1 through N (where N varies per example: 6, 7, or 8), plus potentially gray (5).

Objects:
  - Type: Diagonal Pattern
    Properties:
      - colors: Forms a repeating sequence (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] or [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], etc.).
      - structure: Consistent diagonal stripes where `color = sequence[ (row + col + offset) % sequence_length ]`.
      - location: Pervades the entire grid in the output. Present in the non-white areas of the input.
  - Type: White Regions
    Properties:
      - color: White (0).
      - location: Appear as contiguous or scattered areas within the input grid only.
      - role: Mark locations where the diagonal pattern is missing or needs to be restored.

Relationships:
  - White regions in the input correspond to locations where the diagonal pattern is restored in the output.
  - Non-white pixels in the input are preserved in their original positions in the output.

Actions:
  - Identify: Determine the sequence, length, and offset of the diagonal pattern. The most reliable way is by observing the complete pattern in the output grid.
  - Replace: Iterate through the input grid. If a pixel is white (0), replace it with the color dictated by the identified diagonal pattern rule for that specific (row, col) coordinate.
  - Keep: If a pixel in the input is not white, copy its value directly to the corresponding position in the output grid.
