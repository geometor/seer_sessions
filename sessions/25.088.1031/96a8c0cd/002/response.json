            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code attempts to implement a flood fill algorithm starting from a red pixel (2), expanding into adjacent white pixels (0), and stopping at blue (1) or green (3) boundaries, as well as the grid edges. However, the execution results show that the code incorrectly fills *all* white pixels in the grid with red, regardless of their connectivity to the initial red seed point through paths that do not cross blue or green boundaries. The original blue and green pixels are correctly preserved in the output, but the fill does not respect them as barriers during propagation.\n\nThe core issue is that the flood fill implementation, despite appearing logically sound for a bounded fill, results in an unbounded fill across all white space. The intended behavior, clearly shown in the expected outputs, is a *connected components* fill limited by the specified boundary colors.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Re-verify Flood Fill Logic:** Although the current BFS implementation seems standard, the results dictate a failure. Re-implement the flood fill, potentially using a slightly different approach to ensure boundary constraints are strictly enforced during propagation.\n2.  **Alternative Approach:**\n    *   Perform the BFS starting from the red seed.\n    *   Only add *white* neighbors to the queue and a `reachable_white_cells` set.\n    *   Do *not* modify the grid during the BFS.\n    *   Stop exploring a path when a non-white cell (blue, green, or already visited white cell) or a grid boundary is encountered.\n    *   After the BFS completes, create a copy of the input grid.\n    *   Iterate through the `reachable_white_cells` set and change the corresponding cells in the copied grid to red (2).\n    *   This separates the discovery of reachable cells from the modification of the grid, potentially avoiding subtle bugs in the combined process.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the first example to pinpoint the error pattern.\n\n"
