The output grids are identical to the input grids, except that some white (0) areas have been filled with red (2). The filling seems to originate from the single red pixel in the input and spreads outwards until it hits a boundary.

Find the coordinates (row, column) of the single red (2) pixel in the input grid. This is the starting point for the fill operation.\n    3.  Initiate a flood fill process starting from these coordinates.\n    4.  The fill process expands recursively or iteratively (e.g., using a queue or stack) to adjacent (up, down, left, right) pixels.\n    5.  A pixel can be filled only if it is currently white (0).\n    6.  The fill stops expanding in a direction if it encounters:\n        *   A blue (1) pixel.\n        *   A green (3) pixel.\n        *   The boundary of the grid.\n    7.  Any white (0) pixel reached by the flood fill process should be changed to red (2) in the output grid.\n    8.  Pixels that are originally blue (1), green (3), or the initial red (2) seed pixel are not changed.\n    9.  Return the modified output grid."
