            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code failed because it implemented a simple flood fill originating *from* the single red pixel. The analysis of the failed examples and the expected outputs reveals a different pattern: the transformation involves filling *enclosed regions* of white pixels with red, rather than expanding directly from the initial red pixel.\n\nThe key observations supporting this are:\n1.  **Filled Areas:** In the expected outputs, red color (2) replaces white pixels (0) from the input.\n2.  **Boundaries:** Blue (1) and Green (3) pixels act as static boundaries and remain unchanged. The grid edges also act as boundaries.\n3.  **Enclosed Regions:** The red fill occurs within regions of white pixels that appear to be fully enclosed by boundaries (blue, green, or grid edges). Multiple disconnected regions can be filled within the same grid.\n4.  **Initial Red Pixel:** The single red pixel (2) in the input persists in the output at its original location. Its location does not seem to determine *which* enclosed white regions are filled, as filled regions may not be directly adjacent to it. It likely acts as a trigger or marker indicating that the \"fill enclosed white regions\" operation should occur.\n5.  **Color Changes:** The metrics confirm that only white pixels (0) decrease in count, and red pixels (2) increase by the same amount. Blue (1) and Green (3) counts remain constant. The original red pixel's location is preserved (still red) in the output grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe revised strategy is to implement an algorithm that:\n1.  Copies the input grid to the output grid to preserve boundaries and the initial red pixel.\n2.  Identifies all contiguous regions of white pixels (0).\n3.  For each white region, determines if it is \"enclosed\". A region is enclosed if a flood fill starting from *outside* the grid (e.g., from a hypothetical border of cells surrounding the grid) cannot reach any pixel within that white region without crossing a blue (1) or green (3) pixel. Alternatively, check if any pixel in the white region has a path to the grid edge consisting only of white pixels. If no such path exists for any pixel in the region, it's enclosed.\n4.  Changes the color of all pixels within any identified *enclosed* white region to red (2) in the output grid.\n\n## Metrics\n\n"
