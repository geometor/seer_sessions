task_description: Fill enclosed white regions with red.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  color_palette: [white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3)]

objects:
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: background_fillable
  - type: pixel
    color: blue (1)
    role: boundary_static
  - type: pixel
    color: red (2)
    role: trigger_static # Present in input, remains unchanged, its presence signals the operation.
  - type: pixel
    color: green (3)
    role: boundary_static
  - type: region
    description: Contiguous area of white pixels.
    properties: [enclosed, unenclosed]
  - type: boundary
    description: Formed by blue pixels, green pixels, and the grid edges.

actions:
  - name: identify_enclosed_white_regions
    input: input grid
    output: list of coordinates for each enclosed white region
    description: Find all contiguous regions of white pixels that cannot reach the grid edge by traversing only white pixels. Blue and green pixels block traversal.
  - name: fill_regions
    input: list of coordinates for enclosed white regions
    target_grid: copy of input grid
    output: modified grid
    description: Change the color of all pixels identified as belonging to enclosed white regions to red (2) in the target grid.
  - name: preserve_elements
    input: input grid
    output: output grid
    description: Ensure all non-white pixels (blue, green, the original red) from the input grid retain their original color and position in the output grid. Also, white pixels not part of an enclosed region remain white.

transformation_rule:
  1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  2. Identify all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels.
  3. For each white region, determine if it is enclosed by boundaries (blue (1), green (3), or grid edges). A region is enclosed if none of its pixels can reach the grid edge via a path consisting only of white pixels.
  4. For every identified enclosed white region, change the color of all its constituent pixels to red (2) in the output grid.
  5. Pixels that were originally blue, green, or the single input red pixel remain unchanged. White pixels not part of an enclosed region also remain unchanged.
