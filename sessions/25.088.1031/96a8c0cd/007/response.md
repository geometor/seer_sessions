"""
Transforms the input grid by filling enclosed regions of white pixels (0) with 
red pixels (2). A region is considered enclosed if it is surrounded by blue (1) 
pixels, green (3) pixels, or the grid boundaries, such that no white pixel 
within the region can reach the edge of the grid by moving only through other 
white pixels. The original blue, green, and single red pixels remain unchanged.
