"""
Performs a bounded flood fill originating from the single red (color 2) pixel 
in the input grid. The fill uses red (color 2) and expands into adjacent 
(non-diagonal) white (color 0) pixels. The expansion is stopped by boundaries 
defined by blue (color 1) pixels, green (color 3) pixels, or the edges of the 
grid. Only the reachable white pixels are colored red; all other pixels 
(original red, blue, green, non-reachable white) retain their original color.

It seems numpy types are still causing issues, specifically `int64` within the `red_location` tuple. I need to explicitly convert the coordinates in the tuple to standard Python `int`.

Let's fix the `get_metrics` function again.

*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np
import json

def get_metrics(grid):
    metrics = {}
    # Convert numpy int types to standard Python int for dimensions
    metrics['dimensions'] = tuple(int(d) for d in grid.shape)
    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
    # Convert numpy int types to standard Python int for JSON serialization keys and values
    metrics['color_counts'] = {int(k): int(v) for k, v in zip(unique, counts)} 
    
    # Find location of color 2 (red)
    red_locations = np.argwhere(grid == 2)
    if len(red_locations) > 0:
        # Assuming only one red pixel based on original analysis
        # Convert numpy int types to standard Python int for coordinates
        metrics['red_location'] = tuple(int(coord) for coord in red_locations[0]) 
    else:
        metrics['red_location'] = None
        
    # Ensure all relevant colors (0, 1, 2, 3) are in the counts dict, even if count is 0
    for color in [0, 1, 2, 3]:
        if color not in metrics['color_counts']:
            metrics['color_counts'][color] = 0
            
    return metrics

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code failed because it implemented a simple flood fill originating *from* the single red pixel. The analysis of the failed examples and the expected outputs reveals a different pattern: the transformation involves filling *enclosed regions* of white pixels with red, rather than expanding directly from the initial red pixel.

The key observations supporting this are:
1.  **Filled Areas:** In the expected outputs, red color (2) replaces white pixels (0) from the input.
2.  **Boundaries:** Blue (1) and Green (3) pixels act as static boundaries and remain unchanged. The grid edges also act as boundaries.
3.  **Enclosed Regions:** The red fill occurs within regions of white pixels that appear to be fully enclosed by boundaries (blue, green, or grid edges). Multiple disconnected regions can be filled within the same grid.
4.  **Initial Red Pixel:** The single red pixel (2) in the input persists in the output at its original location. Its location does not seem to determine *which* enclosed white regions are filled, as filled regions may not be directly adjacent to it. It likely acts as a trigger or marker indicating that the "fill enclosed white regions" operation should occur.
5.  **Color Changes:** The metrics confirm that only white pixels (0) decrease in count, and red pixels (2) increase by the same amount. Blue (1) and Green (3) counts remain constant. The original red pixel's location is preserved (still red) in the output grid.

**Strategy:**
The revised strategy is to implement an algorithm that:
1.  Copies the input grid to the output grid to preserve boundaries and the initial red pixel.
2.  Identifies all contiguous regions of white pixels (0).
3.  For each white region, determines if it is "enclosed". A region is enclosed if a flood fill starting from *outside* the grid (e.g., from a hypothetical border of cells surrounding the grid) cannot reach any pixel within that white region without crossing a blue (1) or green (3) pixel. Alternatively, check if any pixel in the white region has a path to the grid edge consisting only of white pixels. If no such path exists for any pixel in the region, it's enclosed.
4.  Changes the color of all pixels within any identified *enclosed* white region to red (2) in the output grid.

```

*(Note: Manually corrected the `red_location` in the output metrics for Examples 1 and 4 based on visual inspection of the expected output grids, as the simple `np.argwhere` approach in the metrics code picked the first red pixel it found, not necessarily the original one when multiple red pixels exist in the output).*

transformation_rule:
  1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  2. Identify all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels.
  3. For each white region, determine if it is enclosed by boundaries (blue (1), green (3), or grid edges). A region is enclosed if none of its pixels can reach the grid edge via a path consisting only of white pixels.
  4. For every identified enclosed white region, change the color of all its constituent pixels to red (2) in the output grid.
  5. Pixels that were originally blue, green, or the single input red pixel remain unchanged. White pixels not part of an enclosed region also remain unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify all contiguous areas (regions) composed entirely of white (0) pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each distinct white region found:
    a.  Check if this region is "enclosed". A region is considered enclosed if it is impossible to draw a path from *any* pixel within that region to *any* pixel on the edge of the grid, moving only horizontally or vertically through other white pixels. Paths are blocked by blue (1) pixels, green (3) pixels, and any non-white pixel.
    b.  If the white region is determined to be enclosed, change the color of *all* pixels belonging to that region to red (2) on the output grid.
4.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid (original blue, green, the single original red, and any white pixels in unenclosed regions) unchanged from their values in the input grid.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
