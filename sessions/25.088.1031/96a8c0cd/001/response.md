Perform a flood fill operation starting from the single red (2) pixel in the input grid.
The fill color is red (2).
The fill expands to adjacent white (0) pixels (up, down, left, right).
The fill stops expanding when it encounters a blue (1) pixel, a green (3) pixel, or the grid boundary.
The original red, blue, and green pixels remain unchanged.
