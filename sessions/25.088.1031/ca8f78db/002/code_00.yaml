task_description: Restore a background pattern in a grid where parts are obscured by white pixels.
grid_properties:
  - type: input_grid
    description: A 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors. Contains a background pattern partially obscured by white (0) pixels.
    height: variable (1-30)
    width: variable (1-30)
  - type: output_grid
    description: A 2D array representing the restored background pattern. White pixels from the input are replaced with the correct pattern color. Dimensions match the input grid.
    height: matches input_grid height
    width: matches input_grid width
objects:
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9), where 0=white, 1=blue, etc.
      - location: (row, column) coordinates
  - object: row
    properties:
      - type: Can be 'solid_blue' (all pixels are blue=1) or 'sequence_based' (contains a repeating sequence of colors).
      - content: list of pixel colors
  - object: color_sequence
    properties:
      - colors: A specific repeating list of colors (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4] or [1, 5]).
      - length: The number of colors in one repetition of the sequence.
    identification: Derived from the first 'sequence_based' row in the input grid that does not contain any white (0) pixels. This row serves as the 'reference sequence'.
actions:
  - action: identify_reference_sequence
    description: Scan the input grid row by row to find the first row that is not 'solid_blue' and contains no white (0) pixels. Store this row's color sequence.
    precondition: Assumes at least one such row exists in the input grid. (Note: This assumption might be invalid based on metric analysis and needs verification/alternative strategy if false).
  - action: restore_pattern
    description: Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel is white (0), determine the correct color based on the identified 'reference_sequence' and the pixel's column index. Replace the white pixel with the calculated color in the output grid.
    target_pixels: Pixels with color 0 (white).
    logic: For a white pixel at (row, column), the replacement color is `reference_sequence[column % sequence_length]`.
    constraint: This replacement only applies if the row is implicitly 'sequence_based'. The presence of a white pixel implies it belongs to a sequence row, as solid blue rows are assumed not to contain white pixels.
  - action: copy_pixels
    description: Pixels that are not white (0) in the input grid are copied directly to the output grid without modification.
