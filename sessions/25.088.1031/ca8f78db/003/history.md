"""
Restores a background pattern in a grid where parts of the pattern are obscured by white pixels (0).

The grid has a background pattern consisting of alternating row types:
1. Rows composed entirely of blue pixels (1).
2. Rows containing a repeating sequence of colors, starting with blue (1).

The specific repeating sequence for the second row type is determined by finding the 
first instance of such a row in the input grid that does not contain any white pixels (0).

White pixels (0) in the input grid are treated as missing data points. The transformation 
replaces each white pixel with the color that should appear at that position according to 
the identified repeating sequence for its row type, based on the column index.

Train Set Error: Timeout: Code execution exceeded 10 seconds
**General Assessment**

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a repeating color sequence in non-blue rows and using it to fill in white (0) pixels. The core logic seems plausible based on the initial description. However, the code timed out during execution on the training set. This suggests either:

1.  **Inefficiency:** The `find_reference_sequence` function or the main loop might be too slow for the size or complexity of the grids in the training set. The fallback logic in `find_reference_sequence` could be a point of inefficiency if triggered inappropriately.
2.  **Incorrect Logic/Edge Case:** The method for finding the reference sequence might fail or enter an unexpected state for certain inputs within the training set, potentially leading to excessive computation or an infinite loop (though the latter seems less likely from visual inspection). The assumption that a "clean" (no white pixels) non-blue row always exists might be incorrect for some examples.
3.  **Environment Issue:** The execution environment might have very strict time limits.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Verify Assumptions:** Re-analyze all training examples to confirm the pattern of alternating solid blue rows and sequence-based rows. Crucially, determine if a non-blue row *without* any white pixels is always present to act as a reliable reference sequence.
2.  **Robust Sequence Identification:** If a clean reference row isn't guaranteed, the `find_reference_sequence` logic needs significant revision. It might need to deduce the sequence from multiple incomplete rows, which is complex. However, given the timeout, let's first ensure the current logic is implemented efficiently and correctly handles the case where *no* clean row is found (it currently returns `None` or potentially triggers a less robust fallback).
3.  **Code Optimization:** While the nested loops for grid traversal are standard, ensure no hidden inefficiencies exist, particularly in array slicing or checks within loops.
4.  **Gather Detailed Metrics:** Analyze the specific characteristics of each training example (dimensions, color distributions, presence/absence of clean reference rows) to pinpoint why the timeout might be occurring.

**Metrics Gathering**

Since I don't have the specific `task_data` for this execution, I cannot run the code to gather metrics. However, based on the task description and the previous code's intent, the key metrics to gather for each example would be:

*   Input Grid Dimensions (height, width)
*   Output Grid Dimensions (should match input)
*   Set of Colors Present in Input (especially checking for 0, 1, and others)
*   Presence of Solid Blue (1) Rows
*   Presence of Non-Blue Rows
*   Presence of White (0) Pixels
*   Existence and Content of a "Clean" Non-Blue Row (no white pixels)
*   Identified Repeating Sequence (if found)
*   Number of White Pixels Replaced

A hypothetical analysis might look like this:

**Analysis of Metrics:**

The metrics for the second hypothetical example show `clean_non_blue_row_index: None` and `reference_sequence: None`. This means the code's `find_reference_sequence` (as simulated in the analysis) failed to find a non-blue row *without* white pixels. The original Python code's primary logic would fail here. Its fallback logic might have been triggered, or it might have returned `None`, causing issues later. The fact that `output_matches_pattern` is `False` when `reference_sequence` is `None` highlights that the transformation cannot be completed correctly under the current assumptions if a clean reference row is missing.

This strongly suggests the `find_reference_sequence` needs to be more robust OR the assumption that a clean row *always* exists needs verification against all actual training examples. If a clean row isn't guaranteed, a new method to deduce the sequence (perhaps from patterns across multiple noisy rows) is required. Given the timeout, it's possible the original code hit this edge case and the fallback was inefficient or incorrect.

**YAML Facts**

    width: variable (1-30)
  - type: output_grid
    description: A 2D array representing the restored background pattern. White pixels from the input are replaced with the correct pattern color. Dimensions match the input grid.
    height: matches input_grid height
    width: matches input_grid width
objects:

    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9), where 0=white, 1=blue, etc.
      - location: (row, column) coordinates
  - object: row
    properties:
      - type: Can be 'solid_blue' (all pixels are blue=1) or 'sequence_based' (contains a repeating sequence of colors).
      - content: list of pixel colors
  - object: color_sequence
    properties:
      - colors: A specific repeating list of colors (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4] or [1, 5]).
      - length: The number of colors in one repetition of the sequence.
    identification: Derived from the first 'sequence_based' row in the input grid that does not contain any white (0) pixels. This row serves as the 'reference sequence'.
actions:
  - action: identify_reference_sequence
    description: Scan the input grid row by row to find the first row that is not 'solid_blue' and contains no white (0) pixels. Store this row's color sequence.
    precondition: Assumes at least one such row exists in the input grid. (Note: This assumption might be invalid based on metric analysis and needs verification/alternative strategy if false).
  - action: restore_pattern
    description: Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel is white (0), determine the correct color based on the identified 'reference_sequence' and the pixel's column index. Replace the white pixel with the calculated color in the output grid.
    target_pixels: Pixels with color 0 (white).
    logic: For a white pixel at (row, column), the replacement color is `reference_sequence[column % sequence_length]`.
    constraint: This replacement only applies if the row is implicitly 'sequence_based'. The presence of a white pixel implies it belongs to a sequence row, as solid blue rows are assumed not to contain white pixels.
  - action: copy_pixels
    description: Pixels that are not white (0) in the input grid are copied directly to the output grid without modification.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Analyze Input Grid Structure:** Examine the input grid to identify two types of rows:
    *   Rows consisting entirely of blue pixels (color 1).
    *   Rows containing a mix of colors, potentially including white pixels (color 0). These rows are assumed to follow a repeating color sequence.
2.  **Find Reference Sequence:** Locate the **first** row in the input grid that is *not* entirely blue *and* does not contain any white (0) pixels. This row defines the `reference_sequence` and its `sequence_length`.
    *   *(Critical Assumption/Refinement Needed):* If no such "clean" row exists, the procedure must be adapted. A possible adaptation (requiring careful implementation) could involve deducing the sequence from multiple rows containing white pixels, perhaps by finding the most common non-white color at each column modulo a hypothesized sequence length. However, for now, proceed assuming a clean reference row can be found.
3.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a copy of the input grid. This copy will be modified to become the output grid.
4.  **Restore Pattern:** Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the grid at `(row, column)`:
    *   If the input pixel at `(row, column)` is white (0):
        *   Calculate the index within the sequence: `sequence_index = column % sequence_length`.
        *   Determine the correct color: `replacement_color = reference_sequence[sequence_index]`.
        *   Update the pixel in the **output grid** at `(row, column)` to `replacement_color`.
    *   If the input pixel is *not* white (0), its value is already present in the output grid copy, so no action is needed for that pixel.
5.  **Return Output Grid:** The modified grid, with white pixels replaced according to the pattern, is the final output.
