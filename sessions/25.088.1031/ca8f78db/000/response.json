Rows composed entirely of blue pixels (1).\n2.  Rows containing a repeating sequence of colors, starting with blue (1).\n\nIn the input grids, some areas of this underlying pattern are obscured by patches of white pixels (0).\nThe output grids restore the original background pattern by replacing the white pixels (0) with the color that should be present at that location according to the repeating sequence of the row it belongs to. The solid blue rows remain unchanged as they don't contain white pixels in the examples.\n\nThe specific repeating sequence in the non-blue rows varies between examples:\n*   Example 1: `1, 4, 2, 5, 3` (blue, yellow, red, gray, green) - Length 5\n*   Example 2: `1, 4` (blue, yellow) - Length 2\n*   Example 3: `1, 4, 7, 3, 6, 2, 5` (blue, yellow, orange, green, magenta, red, gray) - Length 7\n\nThe core task is pattern completion or restoration where white pixels act as \"missing data\" markers.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
