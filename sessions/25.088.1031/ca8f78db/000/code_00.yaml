elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - height: 30
      - width: 30
  - object: pattern
    properties:
      - type: background
      - structure: alternating_rows
      - row_type_1: solid_color
        - color: blue (1)
      - row_type_2: repeating_sequence
        - sequence: varies per example, determined by the first non-solid-blue row without white pixels
        - examples:
          - [1, 4, 2, 5, 3]
          - [1, 4]
          - [1, 4, 7, 3, 6, 2, 5]
  - object: obscuration
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - shape: patches or blocks
      - location: overlaid on the background pattern in input grids

actions:
  - action: identify_pattern
    actor: system
    input: input_grid
    output: repeating_sequence (for non-solid-blue rows)
    condition: Find the first row that is not entirely blue and contains no white pixels. Use this row to define the sequence.
  - action: restore_pattern
    actor: system
    input: input_grid, repeating_sequence
    output: output_grid
    process: Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel is white (0), replace it with the color from the identified repeating sequence corresponding to its column index modulo the sequence length. Otherwise, keep the original pixel color.

relationships:
  - white pixels (0) in the input grid indicate positions where the underlying pattern needs to be restored.
  - the output grid is a restored version of the input grid's pattern, with white pixels replaced.
  - the color used for replacement depends on the column position and the specific repeating sequence of that row type.
