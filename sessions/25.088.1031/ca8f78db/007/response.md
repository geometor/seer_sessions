"""
Restores a repeating horizontal pattern in a grid by filling in specific 'hole' pixels (white=0). 
It prioritizes using a 'template' row (a pattern row with no holes) if available. 
If no template row exists, it determines the pattern by finding the most frequent non-background, 
non-hole color for each column across all pattern rows. 
Rows consisting entirely of the background color (blue=1) are preserved and ignored during pattern analysis.
