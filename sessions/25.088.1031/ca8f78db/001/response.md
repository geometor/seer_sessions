"""
Restores a background pattern in a grid where parts of the pattern are obscured by white pixels (0).

The grid has a background pattern consisting of alternating row types:
1. Rows composed entirely of blue pixels (1).
2. Rows containing a repeating sequence of colors, starting with blue (1).

The specific repeating sequence for the second row type is determined by finding the 
first instance of such a row in the input grid that does not contain any white pixels (0).

White pixels (0) in the input grid are treated as missing data points. The transformation 
replaces each white pixel with the color that should appear at that position according to 
the identified repeating sequence for its row type, based on the column index.
