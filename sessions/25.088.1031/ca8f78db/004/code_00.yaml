task_description: Fill in gaps (holes) in a grid based on a repeating horizontal pattern, preserving existing non-hole pixels.

definitions:
  background_pixel:
    color: blue
    value: 1
    description: Pixels forming solid horizontal lines, separating pattern areas or framing the grid. Assumed not part of the repeating pattern itself.
  hole_pixel:
    color: white
    value: 0
    description: Pixels that need to be filled in with the correct pattern color.
  pattern_pixel:
    color: any color except white (0) and potentially blue (1)
    value: non-0 (and potentially non-1)
    description: Pixels that constitute the repeating horizontal pattern.
  pattern_row:
    description: A row in the grid that contains pattern pixels and potentially hole pixels. It is not composed entirely of background pixels.
  reference_pattern:
    description: A sequence of colors representing one full repetition of the horizontal pattern. Its length corresponds to the width of the grid.
    derivation: Must be determined from the non-hole, non-background pixels within the pattern rows. A robust method aggregates color information column-wise across all pattern rows.

transformation:
  action: inpaint
  input: grid with pattern rows containing hole pixels (white=0) and potentially background rows (blue=1).
  output: grid where hole pixels in pattern rows are replaced by the corresponding color from the reference pattern based on their column index. Background rows and existing pattern pixels remain unchanged.
  steps:
    1. Identify the background color (assumed blue=1) and hole color (assumed white=0).
    2. Identify all 'pattern rows' (rows not consisting entirely of the background color).
    3. Determine the 'reference pattern' sequence (length = grid width):
       For each column index `c`:
         a. Collect colors at `(r, c)` for all pattern rows `r`.
         b. Filter out background and hole colors.
         c. Determine the most frequent color among the remaining ones. This is the reference color for column `c`. (Handle ties or lack of pattern pixels if necessary, e.g., default to background).
    4. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
    5. Iterate through the input grid:
       If a pixel `(r, c)` is a hole pixel (white=0) AND its row `r` is a pattern row:
         Replace the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid with the reference pattern color for column `c`.
