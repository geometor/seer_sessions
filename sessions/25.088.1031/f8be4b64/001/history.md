*   **Perception:** The task involves identifying specific patterns in the input grid and using them to draw lines in the output grid. The core pattern is a non-white, non-green pixel (the "center") surrounded by four green pixels in a plus shape ('+'). Each identified pattern dictates the drawing of a horizontal and a vertical line extending across the grid, colored the same as the center pixel. These lines only overwrite the white background pixels, leaving the original green '+' shapes and their centers intact. If a non-white pixel is not the center of a green '+' shape, or if a green '+' shape lacks a non-green center, no lines are drawn for that element.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Identify specific patterns (a non-white/non-green center pixel surrounded by a green '+' shape) and draw horizontal and vertical lines based on the center's color and position, overwriting only white background pixels.

    elements:
      - element: grid
        description: A 2D array of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9.
      - element: background
        description: Pixels with the color white (0).
      - element: pattern_component
        description: Pixels with the color green (3), typically forming '+' shapes.
      - element: pattern_center
        description: A single pixel of any color except white (0) or green (3).
      - element: pattern_instance
        properties:
          - composition: A pattern_center pixel located at (r, c) with four adjacent pattern_component (green) pixels at (r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), and (r, c+1).
          - center_color: The color of the pattern_center pixel.
          - center_row: The row index (r) of the pattern_center pixel.
          - center_col: The column index (c) of the pattern_center pixel.

    transformation:
      - action: copy_input
        description: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      - action: identify_patterns
        description: Scan the input grid to find all instances of the pattern_instance (a non-white/non-green center pixel surrounded by green '+' pixels).
      - action: draw_lines
        description: For each identified pattern_instance:
          - target: output grid
          - details:
              - Draw a horizontal line across the center_row of the output grid using the center_color. Only change pixels that are currently background (white, 0).
              - Draw a vertical line down the center_col of the output grid using the center_color. Only change pixels that are currently background (white, 0).

    relationships:
      - The presence of a valid pattern_instance in the input triggers the drawing of lines in the output.
      - The color of the lines drawn is determined by the color of the pattern_center.
      - The position of the lines (row and column) is determined by the position of the pattern_center.
      - The lines only replace background pixels; existing non-white pixels from the input (including the green '+' components and the center itself) are preserved in the output.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create the output grid by making an exact copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
    3.  If a pixel at position (row `r`, column `c`) is neither white (0) nor green (3), consider it a potential 'center pixel'. Let its color be `C`.
    4.  Check if this potential center pixel has four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) that are all green (3). Ensure these neighbors are within the grid boundaries.
    5.  If all four neighbors are green (3), then this pixel is confirmed as the center of a green '+' pattern. Perform the following drawing actions on the *output* grid:
        a.  Draw a horizontal line: For every column `j` in the grid, if the pixel at (row `r`, column `j`) in the output grid is currently white (0), change its color to `C`.
        b.  Draw a vertical line: For every row `i` in the grid, if the pixel at (row `i`, column `c`) in the output grid is currently white (0), change its color to `C`.
    6.  After checking all pixels in the input grid and performing the necessary drawing actions for all confirmed center pixels, the resulting output grid is the final solution.
