"""
Identifies specific patterns in the input grid: a non-white (0) and non-green (3) 
center pixel surrounded by a green (3) '+' shape (orthogonal neighbors). 
For each such pattern found, it draws horizontal and vertical lines extending 
across the grid, centered on the pattern's center pixel. The lines use the 
color of the center pixel. These lines overwrite existing pixels in the output 
grid, except for any green pixels that are part of any identified '+' shape.
