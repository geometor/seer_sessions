The core pattern is a non-white, non-green pixel (the \"center\") surrounded by four green pixels in a plus shape ('+'). Each identified pattern dictates the drawing of a horizontal and a vertical line extending across the grid, colored the same as the center pixel. These lines only overwrite the white background pixels, leaving the original green '+' shapes and their centers intact. If a non-white pixel is not the center of a green '+' shape, or if a green '+' shape lacks a non-green center, no lines are drawn for that element.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Check if this potential center pixel has four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) that are all green (3). Ensure these neighbors are within the grid boundaries.\n    5.  If all four neighbors are green (3), then this pixel is confirmed as the center of a green '+' pattern. Perform the following drawing actions on the *output* grid:\n        a.  Draw a horizontal line: For every column `j` in the grid, if the pixel at (row `r`, column `j`) in the output grid is currently white (0), change its color to `C`.\n        b.  Draw a vertical line: For every row `i` in the grid, if the pixel at (row `i`, column `c`) in the output grid is currently white (0), change its color to `C`.\n    6.  After checking all pixels in the input grid and performing the necessary drawing actions for all confirmed center pixels, the resulting output grid is the final solution."
