task_description: Fill the concave areas of azure objects with yellow.

elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
  - element: object
    color: azure (8)
    description: Contiguous shapes made of azure pixels. Input contains one or more such objects.
  - element: fill
    color: yellow (4)
    description: Pixels added in the output grid.

relationships:
  - relationship: spatial
    description: Azure objects are located on the white background.
  - relationship: transformation
    description: Yellow pixels are generated based on the shape of the azure objects.

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    input: input_grid
    element: object (azure)
    description: Find all distinct connected components of azure pixels.
  - action: compute_convex_hull
    input: identified_object (azure)
    output: set_of_hull_pixels
    description: For each azure object, determine the set of pixels that form its convex hull.
  - action: determine_fill_pixels
    input:
      - identified_object (azure)
      - set_of_hull_pixels
    output: set_of_fill_pixels
    description: Identify pixels that are within the convex hull but are not part of the original azure object.
  - action: generate_output
    input:
      - input_grid
      - set_of_fill_pixels (for all objects)
    output: output_grid
    color_map:
      - source_color: white (0) in fill area
      - target_color: yellow (4)
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input grid and then changing the color of the pixels in the 'set_of_fill_pixels' to yellow.

properties:
  - property: convex_hull
    applies_to: object (azure)
    description: The smallest convex shape (in the grid context) that encloses the object. Concave areas within this hull are filled.
