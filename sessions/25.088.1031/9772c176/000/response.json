Additionally, yellow (4) pixels are introduced.\n3.  **Relationship between Input and Output:** The yellow pixels appear to fill in concave regions or \"indentations\" of the original azure shapes. The overall outline of the combined azure and yellow shape in the output looks like the \"filled-in\" version of the input azure shape.\n4.  **Object Identification:** Each contiguous block of azure pixels can be considered a separate object. The transformation seems to operate independently on each identified azure object.\n5.  **Geometric Operation:** The transformation appears related to finding the convex hull of each azure object. The yellow pixels occupy the space within the convex hull that was originally background (white).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
