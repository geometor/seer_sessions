            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code aimed to implement a \"flood fill from border\" algorithm. The core logic described was: identify all pixels that *cannot* reach the grid border via 4-directional movement without crossing an azure (8) pixel, and color these non-azure pixels yellow (4).\n\nBased on visual inspection of the input/output pairs in both examples, this logic appears correct. The yellow pixels in the expected outputs correspond precisely to those non-azure areas that are 'trapped' or 'enclosed' by the azure barriers, preventing them from having a clear path to any edge of the grid.\n\nHowever, the execution results show that the `transform` function failed, producing outputs identical to the inputs (or nearly so, failing to add *any* yellow pixels). This strongly suggests an issue with the previous execution or a subtle bug in the implementation of the `flood_fill_reachable` function or its usage, rather than a flaw in the fundamental understanding of the transformation rule. The strategy should be to re-affirm this logic and ensure the implementation correctly captures it.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\n*   **Color Palette:**\n    *   Inputs consistently use white (0) and azure (8).\n    *   Outputs use white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4).\n*   **Pixel Changes:**\n    *   Azure (8) pixels never change.\n    *   Some white (0) pixels change to yellow (4).\n    *   No other colors are involved or changed.\n*   **Transformation Trigger:** The change from white (0) to yellow (4) occurs specifically for white pixels that are located in regions \"cut off\" from the grid's border by contiguous shapes of azure (8) pixels. Reachability is determined using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.\n        ii.  Check if the neighbor has *not* already been visited/marked as reachable.\n        iii. Check if the neighbor's color is *not* the barrier color (azure 8).\n        iv.  If all conditions (i, ii, iii) are met, mark the neighbor as reachable and enqueue its coordinates.\n7.  After the BFS is complete, iterate through every pixel (r, c) of the input grid.\n8.  If a pixel at (r, c) was *not* marked as reachable during the BFS AND its original color in the input grid was *not* the barrier color (azure 8), set the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the output grid to the fill color (yellow 4).\n9.  Return the modified output grid."
