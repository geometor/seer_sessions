**General Assessment:**

The provided code aimed to implement a "flood fill from border" algorithm. The core logic described was: identify all pixels that *cannot* reach the grid border via 4-directional movement without crossing an azure (8) pixel, and color these non-azure pixels yellow (4).

Based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs in both examples, this logic appears correct. The yellow pixels in the expected outputs correspond precisely to those non-azure areas that are 'trapped' or 'enclosed' by the azure barriers, preventing them from having a clear path to any edge of the grid.

However, the execution results show that the `transform` function failed, producing outputs identical to the inputs (or nearly so, failing to add *any* yellow pixels). This strongly suggests an issue with the previous execution or a subtle bug in the implementation of the `flood_fill_reachable` function or its usage, rather than a flaw in the fundamental understanding of the transformation rule. The strategy should be to re-affirm this logic and ensure the implementation correctly captures it.

**Gather Metrics:**

*   **Color Palette:**
    *   Inputs consistently use white (0) and azure (8).
    *   Outputs use white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4).
*   **Pixel Changes:**
    *   Azure (8) pixels never change.
    *   Some white (0) pixels change to yellow (4).
    *   No other colors are involved or changed.
*   **Transformation Trigger:** The change from white (0) to yellow (4) occurs specifically for white pixels that are located in regions "cut off" from the grid's border by contiguous shapes of azure (8) pixels. Reachability is determined using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right).

    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - forms contiguous shapes (lines or blobs).
      - acts as an impenetrable wall for connectivity checks.
      - location and shape are preserved in the output.
  - type: background_pixel
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - Represents empty space.
      - Can potentially be filled.
  - type: filled_pixel
    color: yellow (4)
    properties:
      - Represents background pixels that have been transformed.
      - Appears only in the output grid.
actions:
  - action: determine_reachability
    description: Find all pixels connected to the grid border without crossing a barrier.
    parameters:
      - connectivity: 4-directional (N, S, E, W).
      - barrier_color: azure (8).
      - start_points: All non-barrier pixels on the top, bottom, left, and right edges of the grid.
    method: Flood fill (e.g., BFS or DFS) starting from the start_points.
    output: A set or mask identifying all reachable pixels.
  - action: fill_unreachable_background
    description: Change the color of unreachable background pixels.
    input_pixels: All pixels in the grid.
    condition: Check if a pixel is NOT marked as reachable AND its color is white (0).
    result: Change the pixel's color to yellow (4).
    unchanged: Pixels marked reachable, and pixels that are the barrier color (azure 8), retain their original color.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Define the barrier color as azure (8) and the fill color as yellow (4).
3.  Identify all pixels on the border (top, bottom, left, right edges) of the input grid.
4.  Create a queue for a Breadth-First Search (BFS) and a set or boolean grid to keep track of visited/reachable pixels.
5.  Initialize the queue and the visited set/grid with all border pixels that are *not* the barrier color (azure 8). Mark these initial pixels as reachable.
6.  While the queue is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue a pixel's coordinates (r, c).
    b.  Examine its four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right).
    c.  For each neighbor:
        i.   Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.
        ii.  Check if the neighbor has *not* already been visited/marked as reachable.
        iii. Check if the neighbor's color is *not* the barrier color (azure 8).
        iv.  If all conditions (i, ii, iii) are met, mark the neighbor as reachable and enqueue its coordinates.
7.  After the BFS is complete, iterate through every pixel (r, c) of the input grid.
8.  If a pixel at (r, c) was *not* marked as reachable during the BFS AND its original color in the input grid was *not* the barrier color (azure 8), set the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the output grid to the fill color (yellow 4).
9.  Return the modified output grid.
