task_description: Fill background areas with yellow if they cannot reach the grid border without crossing an azure barrier.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: variable height and width.
  - background_color: white (0).
objects:
  - type: barrier
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - forms contiguous shapes (lines or blobs).
      - acts as an impenetrable wall for connectivity checks.
      - location and shape are preserved in the output.
  - type: background_pixel
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - Represents empty space.
      - Can potentially be filled.
  - type: filled_pixel
    color: yellow (4)
    properties:
      - Represents background pixels that have been transformed.
      - Appears only in the output grid.
actions:
  - action: determine_reachability
    description: Find all pixels connected to the grid border without crossing a barrier.
    parameters:
      - connectivity: 4-directional (N, S, E, W).
      - barrier_color: azure (8).
      - start_points: All non-barrier pixels on the top, bottom, left, and right edges of the grid.
    method: Flood fill (e.g., BFS or DFS) starting from the start_points.
    output: A set or mask identifying all reachable pixels.
  - action: fill_unreachable_background
    description: Change the color of unreachable background pixels.
    input_pixels: All pixels in the grid.
    condition: Check if a pixel is NOT marked as reachable AND its color is white (0).
    result: Change the pixel's color to yellow (4).
    unchanged: Pixels marked reachable, and pixels that are the barrier color (azure 8), retain their original color.
