"""
Identifies distinct azure (8) objects in the input grid. 
For each object, it finds the white (0) pixels that are enclosed within the object's shape 
(specifically, white pixels within the object's bounding box that cannot be reached by a 
flood fill starting from the grid's border without crossing the object's pixels).
These enclosed white pixels are then colored yellow (4) in the output grid. 
The original azure objects remain unchanged.

**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code failed because its definition of "enclosed" was too restrictive (requiring white pixels to be unreachable from the border *and* within the bounding box). The visual pattern suggests filling concave regions or indentations.

My hypothesis based on neighbor counting ("color white pixel yellow if it has >= 3 azure neighbors") also failed. It generated some correct yellow pixels but missed others and incorrectly colored some white pixels yellow.
*   Example 1: 37 incorrect pixels. The hypothesis wrongly colors some pixels near the edge of the azure shapes yellow and misses some internal yellow pixels.
*   Example 2: 25 incorrect pixels. Similar issues, including missing the single yellow pixel at (0, 6) and the clusters at (5,1), (5,11), etc.

**Revised Strategy:**

The ">= 3 neighbors" rule captures *some* aspect of concavity but isn't precise enough. The rule needs to be more specific about the *arrangement* of neighbors, not just the count.

Let's reconsider the "flood fill from outside" idea combined with the "concavity" concept.
1.  Identify all azure (8) pixels.
2.  Perform a flood fill starting from all *border* pixels that are *not* azure (8). Mark all reachable non-azure pixels. Use 4-directional movement for this fill.
3.  Iterate through all pixels in the grid.
4.  If a pixel is white (0) *and* was *not* reached by the flood fill (meaning it's 'inside' some structure), color it yellow (4).
5.  Keep the original azure pixels as azure (8). All other pixels (originally non-azure and reached by flood fill) should remain as they were (presumably white, 0, but let's confirm this - yes, the background seems consistently white).

This approach focuses on identifying regions truly separated from the outside by the azure structures. Let's verify this logic against the examples visually.

*   **Example 1:** The yellow areas in the output *do* seem to be white areas in the input that are blocked from the border by the azure shape. The large shape creates internal pockets, and the small shape also creates internal pockets relative to its structure.
*   **Example 2:** Similar logic applies. The yellow pixels are in white regions separated from the border by azure pixels.

This revised flood-fill approach seems much more promising than the neighbor counting. It directly addresses the idea of "enclosed" or "inside" relative to the blocking azure shapes.

**Metrics:**

Using the revised flood-fill logic mentally:
*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Grid Size: 26x29
    *   Azure Objects: 2 (one large, one small, disconnected)
    *   Background Color: White (0)
    *   Fill Color: Yellow (4)
    *   Target Pixels (Expected Output): White pixels unreachable from the border via 4-directional movement without crossing azure pixels.
    *   Previous Code Failure: Didn't fill anything.
    *   Neighbor Hypothesis Failure: Mismatched 37 pixels.
    *   Revised Flood Fill Logic: Appears to match the expected output visually.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Grid Size: 22x21
    *   Azure Objects: 2 (disconnected)
    *   Background Color: White (0)
    *   Fill Color: Yellow (4)
    *   Target Pixels (Expected Output): White pixels unreachable from the border via 4-directional movement without crossing azure pixels.
    *   Previous Code Failure: Didn't fill anything.
    *   Neighbor Hypothesis Failure: Mismatched 25 pixels.
    *   Revised Flood Fill Logic: Appears to match the expected output visually.

      - Mark all reachable non-azure pixels.
      - Any white pixel *not* marked by the flood fill is considered unreachable.

      - color: yellow (4)
    outputs:
      - grid: output grid

      - Create a copy of the input grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Create a temporary grid or a 'visited' set to track pixels reachable from the border.
3.  Initialize a queue for flood fill. Add all non-azure (8) pixels located on the border (top/bottom rows, first/last columns) to the queue and mark them as visited.
4.  While the queue is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue a pixel coordinate (r, c).
    b.  For each of its 4-directional neighbors (nr, nc):
        i.  Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.
        ii. Check if the neighbor is not azure (8).
        iii. Check if the neighbor has not been visited yet.
        iv. If all conditions are met, mark the neighbor as visited and enqueue it.
5.  Iterate through every pixel (r, c) in the input grid.
6.  If the input pixel at (r, c) is white (0) AND it was *not* marked as visited during the flood fill, change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to yellow (4).
7.  Return the modified output grid.**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempted to fill enclosed areas based on a flood fill restricted to the bounding box of each object. The results clearly show this was incorrect, as no pixels were colored yellow in the output. The examples demonstrate that the yellow fill occurs in white areas that are enclosed or separated from the main background area (reachable from the grid borders) by the azure (8) shapes, regardless of individual object bounding boxes. My secondary hypothesis based on neighbor counting was also incorrect.

The most promising strategy is to revert to a flood fill approach, but one that considers the entire grid and identifies *all* white (0) pixels that cannot be reached from the grid's border without crossing an azure (8) pixel.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
2.  Identify all background pixels (color 0) that are reachable from the border of the grid without crossing any barrier pixels (color 8).
    a.  Initialize a queue.
    b.  Create a boolean grid `visited` of the same size as the input, initialized to `False`.
    c.  Iterate through all pixels on the border (first/last row, first/last column). If a border pixel is not color 8, add its coordinates to the queue and mark it as `True` in `visited`.
    d.  While the queue is not empty:
        i.  Get the coordinates `(r, c)` of a pixel from the queue.
        ii. Examine its 4 direct neighbors (up, down, left, right).
        iii. For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` that is within the grid bounds, is not color 8, and has not been visited (`visited[nr, nc]` is `False`):
            1.  Mark the neighbor as visited (`visited[nr, nc] = True`).
            2.  Add the neighbor's coordinates `(nr, nc)` to the queue.
3.  Iterate through all pixels `(r, c)` in the grid.
4.  If the pixel in the input grid is background color (0) and it has *not* been visited (`visited[r, c]` is `False`), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the fill color (4).
5.  Return the final output grid.
