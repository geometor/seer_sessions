"""
Identifies distinct azure (8) objects in the input grid. 
For each object, it finds the white (0) pixels that are enclosed within the object's shape 
(specifically, white pixels within the object's bounding box that cannot be reached by a 
flood fill starting from the grid's border without crossing the object's pixels).
These enclosed white pixels are then colored yellow (4) in the output grid. 
The original azure objects remain unchanged.
