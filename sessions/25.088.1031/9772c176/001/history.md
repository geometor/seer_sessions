Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Contents:** The input grids contain one or more distinct shapes made of azure (8) pixels on a white (0) background.
2.  **Output Grid Contents:** The output grids retain the original azure (8) shapes. Additionally, yellow (4) pixels are introduced.
3.  **Relationship between Input and Output:** The yellow pixels appear to fill in concave regions or "indentations" of the original azure shapes. The overall outline of the combined azure and yellow shape in the output looks like the "filled-in" version of the input azure shape.
4.  **Object Identification:** Each contiguous block of azure pixels can be considered a separate object. The transformation seems to operate independently on each identified azure object.
5.  **Geometric Operation:** The transformation appears related to finding the convex hull of each azure object. The yellow pixels occupy the space within the convex hull that was originally background (white).

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct connected objects composed of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each identified azure object:
    a.  Determine the set of coordinates representing the pixels of the object.
    b.  Calculate the convex hull of this set of coordinates. The convex hull defines a region on the grid.
    c.  Iterate through all pixel coordinates within the bounding box of the convex hull.
    d.  For each coordinate within the bounding box, check if it belongs to the calculated convex hull region *and* if the corresponding pixel in the *input* grid is currently white (0).
    e.  If both conditions are true (pixel is inside the hull and was originally white), change the color of that pixel in the *output* grid to yellow (4).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
