task_description: Identify white background pixels that are enclosed by azure shapes (preventing reachability from the grid border) and color these enclosed pixels yellow, leaving the azure shapes and reachable background unchanged.
constants:
  BACKGROUND_COLOR: 0 # white
  BARRIER_COLOR: 8    # azure
  FILL_COLOR: 4       # yellow
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable height and width (up to 30x30)
      - pixels: integer values 0-9 representing colors
      - background: predominantly BACKGROUND_COLOR (white)
  - type: shapes
    properties:
      - composed_of: contiguous BARRIER_COLOR (azure) pixels
      - function: act as barriers separating regions of the grid
      - connectivity: can be multiple disconnected shapes
  - type: regions
    properties:
      - composed_of: contiguous BACKGROUND_COLOR (white) pixels
      - characteristic: defined by reachability from the grid border without crossing BARRIER_COLOR pixels
      - types:
          - reachable_background: white pixels connected to the border
          - enclosed_background: white pixels not connected to the border
actions:
  - name: identify_reachable_background
    inputs:
      - grid: the input grid
      - background_color: BACKGROUND_COLOR (white)
      - barrier_color: BARRIER_COLOR (azure)
    outputs:
      - visited_mask: a boolean grid or set of coordinates indicating all background pixels reachable from the border
    method:
      - Initialize a queue and a visited_mask (same dimensions as grid, all False).
      - Add all border pixels that are not BARRIER_COLOR to the queue and mark them as True in visited_mask.
      - Perform a 4-directional flood fill:
          - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a pixel (r, c).
          - For each valid neighbor (nr, nc):
              - If the neighbor is not BARRIER_COLOR and not visited, mark as visited and enqueue.
  - name: fill_enclosed_background
    inputs:
      - input_grid: the original input grid
      - visited_mask: the output from identify_reachable_background
      - background_color: BACKGROUND_COLOR (white)
      - fill_color: FILL_COLOR (yellow)
    outputs:
      - output_grid: the transformed grid
    method:
      - Create a copy of the input_grid to serve as the output_grid.
      - Iterate through all pixels (r, c) of the input_grid.
      - If input_grid[r, c] is BACKGROUND_COLOR and visited_mask[r, c] is False, set output_grid[r, c] to FILL_COLOR.
