            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous code failed because its definition of \"enclosed\" was too restrictive (requiring white pixels to be unreachable from the border *and* within the bounding box). The visual pattern suggests filling concave regions or indentations.\n\nMy hypothesis based on neighbor counting (\"color white pixel yellow if it has >= 3 azure neighbors\") also failed. It generated some correct yellow pixels but missed others and incorrectly colored some white pixels yellow.\n*   Example 1: 37 incorrect pixels. The hypothesis wrongly colors some pixels near the edge of the azure shapes yellow and misses some internal yellow pixels.\n*   Example 2: 25 incorrect pixels. Similar issues, including missing the single yellow pixel at (0, 6) and the clusters at (5,1), (5,11), etc.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\nThe \">= 3 neighbors\" rule captures *some* aspect of concavity but isn't precise enough. The rule needs to be more specific about the *arrangement* of neighbors, not just the count.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"flood fill from outside\" idea combined with the \"concavity\" concept.\n1.  Identify all azure (8) pixels.\n2.  Perform a flood fill starting from all *border* pixels that are *not* azure (8). Mark all reachable non-azure pixels. Use 4-directional movement for this fill.\n3.  Iterate through all pixels in the grid.\n4.  If a pixel is white (0) *and* was *not* reached by the flood fill (meaning it's 'inside' some structure), color it yellow (4).\n5.  Keep the original azure pixels as azure (8). All other pixels (originally non-azure and reached by flood fill) should remain as they were (presumably white, 0, but let's confirm this - yes, the background seems consistently white).\n\nThis approach focuses on identifying regions truly separated from the outside by the azure structures. Let's verify this logic against the examples visually.\n\n*   **Example 1:** The yellow areas in the output *do* seem to be white areas in the input that are blocked from the border by the azure shape. The large shape creates internal pockets, and the small shape also creates internal pockets relative to its structure.\n*   **Example 2:** Similar logic applies. The yellow pixels are in white regions separated from the border by azure pixels.\n\nThis revised flood-fill approach seems much more promising than the neighbor counting. It directly addresses the idea of \"enclosed\" or \"inside\" relative to the blocking azure shapes.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nUsing the revised flood-fill logic mentally:\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Grid Size: 26x29\n    *   Azure Objects: 2 (one large, one small, disconnected)\n    *   Background Color: White (0)\n    *   Fill Color: Yellow (4)\n    *   Target Pixels (Expected Output): White pixels unreachable from the border via 4-directional movement without crossing azure pixels.\n    *   Previous Code Failure: Didn't fill anything.\n    *   Neighbor Hypothesis Failure: Mismatched 37 pixels.\n    *   Revised Flood Fill Logic: Appears to match the expected output visually.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Grid Size: 22x21\n    *   Azure Objects: 2 (disconnected)\n    *   Background Color: White (0)\n    *   Fill Color: Yellow (4)\n    *   Target Pixels (Expected Output): White pixels unreachable from the border via 4-directional movement without crossing azure pixels.\n    *   Previous Code Failure: Didn't fill anything.\n    *   Neighbor Hypothesis Failure: Mismatched 25 pixels.\n    *   Revised Flood Fill Logic: Appears to match the expected output visually.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Return the modified output grid.**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code attempted to fill enclosed areas based on a flood fill restricted to the bounding box of each object. The results clearly show this was incorrect, as no pixels were colored yellow in the output. The examples demonstrate that the yellow fill occurs in white areas that are enclosed or separated from the main background area (reachable from the grid borders) by the azure (8) shapes, regardless of individual object bounding boxes. My secondary hypothesis based on neighbor counting was also incorrect.\n\nThe most promising strategy is to revert to a flood fill approach, but one that considers the entire grid and identifies *all* white (0) pixels that cannot be reached from the grid's border without crossing an azure (8) pixel.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n| Example | Input Size | Output Size | Input Colors   | Output Colors      | Code Output Match | Pixels Off (Code) | Neighbor Hypo.
