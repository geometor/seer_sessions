task_description: Identify white background pixels enclosed by azure shapes and color them yellow.
constants:
  BACKGROUND_COLOR: 0 # white
  OBJECT_COLOR: 8     # azure
  FILL_COLOR: 4       # yellow
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - Contains pixels of various colors.
      - Background is predominantly white (0).
  - type: shape
    properties:
      - Composed of contiguous azure (8) pixels.
      - Can be concave or convex.
      - Acts as a barrier.
      - Multiple disconnected shapes can exist.
actions:
  - name: find_unreachable_background
    inputs:
      - grid: input grid
      - barrier_color: azure (8)
      - background_color: white (0)
    outputs:
      - set of coordinates: (row, col) for white pixels not reachable from the grid border without crossing azure pixels.
    method:
      - Perform a flood fill (4-directional) starting from all non-azure border pixels.
      - Mark all reachable non-azure pixels.
      - Any white pixel *not* marked by the flood fill is considered unreachable.
  - name: color_pixels
    inputs:
      - grid: input grid
      - coordinates: set of coordinates from find_unreachable_background
      - color: yellow (4)
    outputs:
      - grid: output grid
    method:
      - Create a copy of the input grid.
      - Change the color of pixels at the specified coordinates to yellow (4).
      - Ensure original azure (8) pixels remain unchanged.
