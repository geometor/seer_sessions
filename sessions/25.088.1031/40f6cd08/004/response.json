            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying objects, classifying them as \"sources\" (containing multiple colors) or \"targets\" (containing a single color) based on a \"primary color\" derived from the object's pixels, and then copying a pattern from the source to the targets.\n\nThe code failed on all training examples. The results show that while the object identification and source/target classification might be conceptually correct, the specific definition of the \"pattern\" being copied and the method of placing it onto the target are flawed.\n\n*   **Incorrect Pattern Extraction:** The code extracts the entire bounding box of the source object as the pattern. However, the expected outputs indicate that only the *internal* content of the source (pixels *different* from the primary/frame color) should be considered the pattern.\n*   **Incorrect Pattern Placement:** The code places the extracted pattern by aligning the top-left corner of the pattern with the top-left corner of the target object's bounding box, overwriting whatever is there. The expected outputs show that the source's internal pattern should replace the *internal* content of the target, leaving the target's frame (pixels matching the primary color) intact.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Refine the definition of the \"source pattern\": It consists only of the pixels within the source object's bounding box that *do not* match the object's primary/frame color.\n2.  Refine the pattern application logic: For each target object, identify the area corresponding to its internal content. Copy the source pattern into this area, pixel by pixel, preserving the target's original frame pixels. The relative position of the pattern pixels within the source frame should be maintained when placing them inside the target frame.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Input Objects                                                                   | Output Objects                                                                       | Code Failure Analysis                                                                                                                               |\n| :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | Source: Green frame with Yellow/Blue/Azure inside.
