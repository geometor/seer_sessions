task_description: Copy the internal pattern from a 'source' object into one or more 'target' objects of the same primary color.

definitions:
  object: A connected component of non-background (non-white) pixels.
  primary_color: The color forming the outer frame or main body of an object. For multi-colored objects, it's typically the color of the outermost layer or the most frequent color connected to the background. For single-colored objects, it's simply that color. (Refinement: The code's method of using the first found pixel seems sufficient for these examples, as the frames are uniform).
  source_object: An object containing pixels of its primary color AND pixels of other color(s) internally.
  target_object: An object containing *only* pixels of its primary color.
  internal_pattern: The configuration of pixels within the source object's bounding box whose color is *different* from the source object's primary color.
  frame_pixels: Pixels within an object's bounding box whose color *matches* the object's primary color.

observations:
  - The grid contains one or more objects, identifiable by their color and connectivity.
  - Objects can be grouped by their primary color (e.g., all green-framed objects).
  - Within each color group, there is typically one source object and one or more target objects.
  - The source object contains an internal pattern composed of colors different from its primary color.
  - Target objects are composed solely of their primary color and share the same shape/size as the source object's frame in these examples.

actions:
  - Identify all objects and determine their primary color, bounding box, and pixel set.
  - Classify objects into sources and targets based on whether they contain colors other than their primary color.
  - Group objects by primary color.
  - For each group containing exactly one source and at least one target:
    - Define the source's internal pattern (pixels within the source bbox != primary color).
    - For each target object in the group:
      - Iterate through the positions within the source object's bounding box.
      - If a pixel at a relative position `(dr, dc)` within the source bounding box belongs to the *internal pattern* (i.e., its color is not the primary color):
        - Copy this pixel's color to the corresponding relative position `(dr, dc)` within the *target* object's bounding box in the output grid.
      - Pixels corresponding to the source's frame pixels are *not* copied; the target's frame pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.
  - The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid and is modified by these copy operations.
