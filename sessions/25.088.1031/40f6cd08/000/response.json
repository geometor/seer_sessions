For each training pair, there are several rectangles sharing the same primary \"outline\" or \"base\" color (e.g., green in train_1, red in train_2, azure in train_3). One of these rectangles has an internal pattern composed of different colors, while the others are initially solid blocks of the base color. The transformation involves identifying the patterned rectangle and copying its internal pattern onto all the solid rectangles of the same base color. The original patterned rectangle and the background remain unchanged. The copying preserves the relative positioning of the pattern within the rectangle's boundaries.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
