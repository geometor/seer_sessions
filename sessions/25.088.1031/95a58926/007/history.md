"""
Identifies solid horizontal and vertical grid lines (rows/columns entirely gray, color 5) in the input grid.
Finds the unique 'target' color (not white 0 or gray 5) present in the input.
Initializes the output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
Constructs a clean gray grid structure on the output grid by drawing only the identified solid gray lines.
Iterates through each intersection point (r, c) defined by the identified solid horizontal and vertical lines.
For each intersection, defines the corresponding 'cell' area in the input grid. The cell is the rectangular region strictly bounded by the current lines (r, c) and the immediately preceding lines (or grid edges if no preceding line exists).
Scans this input cell area for the presence of the target color.
If the target color is found within the input cell, the corresponding intersection point (r, c) in the output grid is changed from gray (5) to the target color.
Otherwise, the intersection point remains gray. All other non-grid areas in the output remain white (0).

Okay, let's break down the failures and refine the approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The core issue with the previous code lies in its definition of grid lines. It strictly required lines to be *entirely* gray (color 5). However, analyzing the failed examples reveals that the relevant grid lines in the input are defined differently: they are the rows and columns that form a grid structure where the *intersections* of these lines are consistently gray (5), even if the lines themselves contain other colors (white, or the target color) *between* the intersections.

The strategy needs to be adjusted to:
1.  **Identify potential grid lines**: Find rows and columns that are candidates for forming the grid structure. This might involve looking for rows/columns with a significant number of gray pixels or regular spacing of gray pixels.
2.  **Verify the grid structure**: Confirm that a hypothesized set of horizontal lines (`H`) and vertical lines (`V`) satisfies the condition that all their intersection points (`input[r, c]` for `r` in `H`, `c` in `V`) are gray (5).
3.  **Construct the output grid**: Create a clean grid using only the *verified* lines (`H`, `V`), drawn as solid gray.
4.  **Color intersections**: For each intersection `(r, c)` in the verified grid, check the corresponding cell (`input[r_prev+1:r, c_prev+1:c]`) in the input grid. If the target color is present in that cell, color the intersection `(r, c)` in the output grid with the target color.

**Metrics and Observations**

Let's verify the "gray intersection" hypothesis and spacing for each example.
