            "text": "Okay, let's break down the failures and refine the approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe core issue with the previous code lies in its definition of grid lines. It strictly required lines to be *entirely* gray (color 5). However, analyzing the failed examples reveals that the relevant grid lines in the input are defined differently: they are the rows and columns that form a grid structure where the *intersections* of these lines are consistently gray (5), even if the lines themselves contain other colors (white, or the target color) *between* the intersections.\n\nThe strategy needs to be adjusted to:\n1.  **Identify potential grid lines**: Find rows and columns that are candidates for forming the grid structure. This might involve looking for rows/columns with a significant number of gray pixels or regular spacing of gray pixels.\n2.  **Verify the grid structure**: Confirm that a hypothesized set of horizontal lines (`H`) and vertical lines (`V`) satisfies the condition that all their intersection points (`input[r, c]` for `r` in `H`, `c` in `V`) are gray (5).\n3.  **Construct the output grid**: Create a clean grid using only the *verified* lines (`H`, `V`), drawn as solid gray.\n4.  **Color intersections**: For each intersection `(r, c)` in the verified grid, check the corresponding cell (`input[r_prev+1:r, c_prev+1:c]`) in the input grid. If the target color is present in that cell, color the intersection `(r, c)` in the output grid with the target color.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nLet's verify the \"gray intersection\" hypothesis and spacing for each example.\n\n"
