Okay, let's break down the failures and refine the approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The core issue with the previous code lies in its definition of grid lines. It strictly required lines to be *entirely* gray (color 5). However, analyzing the failed examples reveals that the relevant grid lines in the input are defined differently: they are the rows and columns that form a grid structure where the *intersections* of these lines are consistently gray (5), even if the lines themselves contain other colors (white, or the target color) *between* the intersections.

The strategy needs to be adjusted to:
1.  **Identify potential grid lines**: Find rows and columns that are candidates for forming the grid structure. This might involve looking for rows/columns with a significant number of gray pixels or regular spacing of gray pixels.
2.  **Verify the grid structure**: Confirm that a hypothesized set of horizontal lines (`H`) and vertical lines (`V`) satisfies the condition that all their intersection points (`input[r, c]` for `r` in `H`, `c` in `V`) are gray (5).
3.  **Construct the output grid**: Create a clean grid using only the *verified* lines (`H`, `V`), drawn as solid gray.
4.  **Color intersections**: For each intersection `(r, c)` in the verified grid, check the corresponding cell (`input[r_prev+1:r, c_prev+1:c]`) in the input grid. If the target color is present in that cell, color the intersection `(r, c)` in the output grid with the target color.

**Metrics and Observations**

Let's verify the "gray intersection" hypothesis and spacing for each example.
