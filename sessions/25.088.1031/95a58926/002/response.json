            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempt correctly identified the core components of the task: a gray grid structure, a unique \"target\" color within the input, and a transformation rule involving checking rectangular cells defined by the grid lines. The output grid structure generally matched the expected structure (gray lines, white background).\n\nHowever, the transformation failed because the rule for determining the grid lines was too strict. It required rows and columns to be *entirely* composed of gray pixels (5) in the *input* grid. The examples show that these input grid lines can be \"interrupted\" by the target color or other colors. The code correctly identified the target color and the logic for checking cell contents (`np.any(cell == target_color)`) and coloring the corresponding *bottom-right* intersection point seems correct based on manual inspection of the examples.\n\nThe primary error was in the `find_grid_lines` function. It failed to identify grid lines that were not solid gray in the input, leading it to miss most intersections and thus failing to color them correctly in the output. The one intersection it often *did* process correctly was typically formed by lines that *happened* to be solid gray in the input.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Refine Grid Line Identification:** Implement a more robust method to identify horizontal and vertical grid lines. This method should recognize lines even if they contain non-gray pixels in the input, likely by looking for rows/columns that have gray pixels at most of the expected intersection points or contain a significant number of gray pixels overall. A potential method is to identify rows/columns containing at least two gray pixels as candidate lines.\n2.  **Reconstruct Output Grid:** Create the output grid by first initializing it to white (0), then drawing the *complete*, *solid* gray grid lines based on the identified `horz_lines` and `vert_lines`.\n3.  **Apply Cell Logic:** Iterate through the intersection points `(r, c)` defined by the identified lines. For each intersection, determine the corresponding cell boundaries (area above and to the left). Check if the *input* grid contains the `target_color` within that cell. If it does, color the intersection point `(r, c)` in the *output* grid with the `target_color`. Otherwise, it remains gray (as set in step 2).\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's use code execution to get specific details about the failed examples using the *original* code's logic for context.\n\n"
