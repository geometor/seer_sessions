task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - element: background_color
    value: 0 (white)
    description: The predominant color filling empty space.
  - element: structure_color
    value: 5 (gray)
    description: Forms horizontal and vertical lines creating a grid structure.
  - element: target_color
    value: [2 (red), 3 (green), 4 (yellow)] # Varies per example
    description: The single color, other than background and structure colors, present in the input grid. Represents the 'content' of the cells.
  - element: cell
    description: A rectangular region bounded by gray lines or the grid edges.
  - element: intersection_point
    description: A pixel where a horizontal gray line and a vertical gray line cross. Corresponds to the bottom-right corner of a specific cell.

relationships:
  - type: defines
    subject: structure_color (gray lines)
    object: cells
    details: The horizontal and vertical gray lines define the boundaries of the cells.
  - type: contains
    subject: cells
    object: target_color pixels (in input)
    details: Some cells in the input grid contain one or more pixels of the target color.
  - type: determines
    subject: presence of target_color in input cell
    object: color of corresponding intersection_point in output
    details: If an input cell contains the target color, its bottom-right intersection point becomes the target color in the output; otherwise, it remains gray.

actions:
  - action: identify
    actor: rule
    subject: structure_color lines (horizontal and vertical)
    description: Find all row and column indices containing full gray lines.
  - action: identify
    actor: rule
    subject: target_color
    description: Find the unique color in the input that is not white (0) or gray (5).
  - action: identify
    actor: rule
    subject: intersection_points
    description: Find coordinates (r, c) where horizontal and vertical gray lines cross.
  - action: determine_cell_boundaries
    actor: rule
    subject: intersection_point (r, c)
    description: Find the gray lines immediately above and to the left (r_prev, c_prev) to define the cell boundaries (rows r_prev+1 to r-1, cols c_prev+1 to c-1). Handle grid edges.
  - action: scan
    actor: rule
    subject: input cell
    object: target_color
    description: Check if the defined cell contains any pixel of the target_color in the input grid.
  - action: generate_output
    actor: rule
    description: Create an output grid of the same dimensions.
  - action: copy_structure
    actor: rule
    source: input grid
    target: output grid
    elements: gray pixels (5)
    description: Initially copy all gray pixels to the output grid.
  - action: clear_content
    actor: rule
    target: output grid
    elements: non-gray pixels
    color: 0 (white)
    description: Set all non-gray pixels in the output grid to white.
  - action: update_intersections
    actor: rule
    target: output grid
    elements: intersection_points
    condition: corresponding input cell contained target_color
    color: target_color
    description: Change the color of specific intersection points in the output grid based on the content of their corresponding input cell.
