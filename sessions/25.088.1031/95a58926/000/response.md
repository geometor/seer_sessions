Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The input grids feature a prominent structure composed of gray (5) horizontal lines and vertical lines, effectively dividing the grid into smaller rectangular "cells". The background is white (0).
2.  **Target Color**: Within these cells (and sometimes on the gray lines themselves), there are scattered pixels of a single distinct color other than white or gray. This "target" color is red (2) in `train_1`, green (3) in `train_2`, and yellow (4) in `train_3`.
3.  **Transformation**: The output grid retains the gray line structure but removes all the scattered target color pixels *from within the cells*, replacing them with white (0).
4.  **Intersection Marking**: The crucial change happens at the *intersections* of the horizontal and vertical gray lines. In the output grid, an intersection point keeps its gray color *unless* the corresponding cell (the rectangular area bounded by the gray lines for which this intersection is the bottom-right corner) contained at least one pixel of the target color in the *input* grid. If the cell contained the target color, the intersection point in the output grid is changed from gray (5) to the target color.
5.  **Consistency**: The dimensions of the grid remain the same. All pixels that are not part of the gray structure and are not target colors in the input are white (0) in the output. Gray pixels *not* at an intersection remain gray.

relationships:
  - type: defines
    subject: structure_color (gray lines)
    object: cells
    details: The horizontal and vertical gray lines define the boundaries of the cells.
  - type: contains
    subject: cells
    object: target_color pixels (in input)
    details: Some cells in the input grid contain one or more pixels of the target color.
  - type: determines
    subject: presence of target_color in input cell
    object: color of corresponding intersection_point in output
    details: If an input cell contains the target color, its bottom-right intersection point becomes the target color in the output; otherwise, it remains gray.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialize Output**: Create a new grid (the output) with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  **Identify Grid Structure**:
    *   Scan the input grid to find the row indices that consist entirely of gray (5) pixels or a repeating pattern indicating a line (e.g., handling cases where lines might be broken by other colors, although in these examples they seem solid gray). Store these as horizontal gray line indices.
    *   Scan the input grid to find the column indices that consist entirely of gray (5) pixels. Store these as vertical gray line indices.
3.  **Identify Target Color**: Find the unique pixel color in the input grid that is not white (0) and not gray (5). This is the `target_color`.
4.  **Build Base Output**:
    *   Fill the output grid initially with white (0) pixels.
    *   Copy all gray (5) pixels from their original positions in the input grid to the output grid.
5.  **Process Intersections**:
    *   Iterate through each row index `r` identified as a horizontal gray line.
    *   For each `r`, iterate through each column index `c` identified as a vertical gray line. The coordinate (`r`, `c`) is an intersection point.
    *   For each intersection point (`r`, `c`):
        *   Determine the boundaries of the corresponding cell in the input grid:
            *   Find the largest row index `r_prev` < `r` that is also a horizontal gray line index (use -1 if `r` is the first gray line).
            *   Find the largest column index `c_prev` < `c` that is also a vertical gray line index (use -1 if `c` is the first gray line).
            *   The cell spans rows from `r_prev + 1` to `r - 1` and columns from `c_prev + 1` to `c - 1`.
        *   Scan all pixels within this calculated cell region in the *input* grid.
        *   Check if any pixel within this cell has the `target_color`.
        *   If the cell contains at least one `target_color` pixel, set the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the *output* grid to the `target_color`. (Otherwise, it remains gray from step 4).
6.  **Final Output**: The modified grid is the final output.
