            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are large (23x23) and have a consistent structure. They appear to be composed of smaller 3x3 sections separated by lines of yellow pixels (color 4). These yellow lines form a grid pattern, dividing the larger grid into a 6x6 array of 3x3 subgrids.\n2.  **Subgrids:** The core transformations seem to happen *within* these 3x3 subgrids. The yellow separators remain unchanged.\n3.  **Colors:**\n    *   White (0) acts as a background within the subgrids.\n    *   Yellow (4) acts as a separator between subgrids.\n    *   Blue (1) is a key color involved in the transformation.\n    *   Other colors (azure 8, magenta 6, green 3) appear in some subgrids and seem to determine the *result* of the transformation for that specific subgrid.\n4.  **Transformation Trigger:** The change involves blue (1) pixels. Specifically, a blue pixel changes color only if it's adjacent (including diagonally) to another blue pixel within the same 3x3 subgrid.\n5.  **Transformation Outcome:** When a blue pixel changes, it takes on the color of the *other* non-white, non-blue, non-yellow pixel present in that same 3x3 subgrid. Let's call this the 'target color'. If no such unique target color exists in the subgrid, or if a blue pixel has no blue neighbors, no change occurs.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
