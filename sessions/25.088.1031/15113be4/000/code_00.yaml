Grid_Structure:
  - type: Composite Grid
  - description: A large grid composed of 3x3 subgrids separated by single rows and columns of yellow (4) pixels.
  - dimensions: 23x23 overall, arranged as 6x6 subgrids.

Subgrids:
  - type: Object
  - description: Individual 3x3 pixel areas within the larger grid, bounded by yellow separators.
  - properties:
      - contains_pixels: Holds pixels of various colors.
      - may_contain_target_color: Might contain a unique color other than white(0), blue(1), or yellow(4).
      - may_contain_blue_pixels: Might contain one or more blue(1) pixels.
  - relationship: Processed independently.

Pixels:
  - type: Element
  - description: Individual cells within subgrids.
  - properties:
      - color: Integer value 0-9.
      - position: Row and column within the subgrid.
      - neighbors: 8 adjacent pixels (orthogonal and diagonal) within the same subgrid.
  - key_colors:
      - white (0): Background.
      - blue (1): Subject of potential transformation.
      - yellow (4): Separator, remains unchanged.
      - target_color (variable, e.g., 8, 6, 3): The unique non-background/separator/blue color within a subgrid; becomes the output color for transformed blue pixels.

Transformation_Rule:
  - scope: Applies independently to each 3x3 subgrid.
  - trigger_condition: A blue(1) pixel exists within a subgrid.
  - action_condition: The blue(1) pixel has at least one blue(1) neighbor (orthogonally or diagonally adjacent) within the same 3x3 subgrid.
  - prerequisite: The subgrid must contain exactly one unique 'target_color' (not 0, 1, or 4).
  - action: Change the color of the triggering blue(1) pixel to the subgrid's 'target_color'.
  - no_action: If action_condition or prerequisite is not met, the blue(1) pixel remains unchanged.

Output_Grid:
  - structure: Identical to the input grid structure (3x3 subgrids separated by yellow).
  - content: Contains the original pixels, except for blue(1) pixels that met the transformation conditions, which are replaced by the corresponding subgrid's target_color.
