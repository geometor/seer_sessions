Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1.  **Identify Objects**:
    *   Find all contiguous regions of non-white pixels (color != 0) in the input grid.
    *   Designate the region with the largest number of pixels as the "pattern object". Note its color (`pattern_color`) and the set of coordinates it occupies (`pattern_coords`).
    *   Identify all other non-white pixels in the grid as "marker pixels". Note their coordinates and colors (`marker_pixels`).
2.  **Determine Coordinate Sets**:
    *   Create a set `pattern_rows` containing all unique row indices from `pattern_coords`.
    *   Create a set `pattern_cols` containing all unique column indices from `pattern_coords`.
    *   Create a set `inhibited_rows` containing all unique row indices from the `marker_pixels`.
    *   Create a set `inhibited_cols` containing all unique column indices from the `marker_pixels`.
3.  **Construct Output Grid**:
    *   Initialize a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    *   **Project Pattern Horizontally**: Iterate through each row index `r` present in `pattern_rows`. If this row `r` is *not* present in `inhibited_rows`, then iterate through all columns `c` of the grid. If column `c` is *not* present in `inhibited_cols`, set the output grid cell `(r, c)` to the `pattern_color`.
    *   **Project Pattern Vertically**: Iterate through each column index `c` present in `pattern_cols`. If this column `c` is *not* present in `inhibited_cols`, then iterate through all rows `r` of the grid. If row `r` is *not* present in `inhibited_rows`, set the output grid cell `(r, c)` to the `pattern_color`. (Note: This might overwrite some cells filled during horizontal projection, which is acceptable as it's the same color).
    *   **Overlay Pattern**: Iterate through all coordinates `(r, c)` in the original `pattern_coords`. Set the output grid cell `(r, c)` to the `pattern_color`, ensuring the original pattern shape is preserved and overwrites any background filling within its bounds.
    *   **Overlay Markers**: Iterate through all `marker_pixels`. For each marker at `(r, c)` with color `M`, set the output grid cell `(r, c)` to `M`, ensuring markers appear on top of the filled background and the pattern.
4.  **Return**: Return the completed output grid.
