Identify the largest contiguous object of a single non-white color in the input grid. This is the \"pattern object\". Note its color (C) and its coordinates.\n2. Identify all other non-white pixels in the input grid. These are the \"marker pixels\". Note their color(s) (M) and their locations (row and column indices).\n3. Create a set `inhibited_rows` containing the row indices of all marker pixels.\n4. Create a set `inhibited_cols` containing the column indices of all marker pixels.\n5. Initialize a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n6. Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the grid.\n7. If row index `r` is *not* present in the set `inhibited_rows` AND column index `c` is *not* present in the set `inhibited_cols`, set the output grid cell `(r, c)` to the pattern object's color (C). This fills the grid where neither the row nor the column is blocked by a marker.\n8. Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the input grid. If the input cell `(r, c)` was part of the original pattern object (i.e., had color C), set the corresponding output cell `(r, c)` to color C. This overlays the original pattern shape onto the filled area, ensuring its pixels retain the pattern color.\n9. Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the input grid. If the input cell `(r, c)` was a marker pixel (i.e., had color M), set the corresponding output cell `(r, c)` to color M. This overlays the marker pixels, ensuring they appear on top.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_all_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects (connected components) of the same non-background color.\n    \n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        \n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an object\n              with keys 'color' (int) and 'coords' (set of (row, col) tuples).\n              Returns an empty list if no non-background objects are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n    \n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # If the cell is non-background and not visited yet, start a search\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                coords = set()\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                \n                # Breadth-First Search (BFS) for connected component\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    coords.add((row, col))\n                    \n                    # Check 4-directional neighbors\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        \n                        # Check bounds, color match, and visited status\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and \\\n                           not visited[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == color:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                            \n                # Store the found object\n                if coords:\n                    objects.append({'color': color, 'coords': coords})\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the identified pattern and marker objects.\n    Fills cells across the entire grid with the pattern color,\n    if the cell's row AND column are not inhibited by marker pixels.\n    Then overlays the original pattern and markers.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a list of lists.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    \n    # 1.
