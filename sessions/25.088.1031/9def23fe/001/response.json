Identify the largest contiguous object of a single non-white color in the input grid. This is the \"pattern object\". Note its color (C) and determine its bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).\n2. Identify all other non-white pixels in the input grid. These are the \"marker pixels\". Note their color(s) (M) and their locations (row and column indices).\n3. Create a set `R_marker` containing the row indices of all marker pixels.\n4. Create a set `C_marker` containing the column indices of all marker pixels.\n5. Initialize a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n6. Iterate through all rows `r` from the minimum row to the maximum row of the pattern object's bounding box. If row index `r` is *not* present in the set `R_marker`, fill the *entire* row `r` of the output grid with the pattern object's color (C).\n7. Iterate through all columns `c` from the minimum column to the maximum column of the pattern object's bounding box. If column index `c` is *not* present in the set `C_marker`, fill the *entire* column `c` of the output grid with the pattern object's color (C).\n8. Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the input grid. If the input cell `(r, c)` was part of the original pattern object (i.e., had color C), set the corresponding output cell `(r, c)` to color C.\n9. Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the input grid. If the input cell `(r, c)` was a marker pixel (i.e., had color M), set the corresponding output cell `(r, c)` to color M.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_all_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects (connected components) of the same non-background color.\n    \n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        \n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an object\n              with keys 'color' (int) and 'coords' (set of (row, col) tuples).\n              Returns an empty list if no non-background objects are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n    \n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # If the cell is non-background and not visited yet, start a search\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                coords = set()\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                \n                # Breadth-First Search (BFS) for connected component\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    coords.add((row, col))\n                    \n                    # Check 4-directional neighbors\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        \n                        # Check bounds, color match, and visited status\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and \\\n                           not visited[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == color:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                            \n                # Store the found object\n                if coords:\n                    objects.append({'color': color, 'coords': coords})\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the identified pattern and marker objects.\n    Fills rows and columns intersecting the pattern object's bounding box,\n    unless inhibited by marker pixels, then overlays the original pattern and markers.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a list of lists.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    \n    # 1 & 2.
