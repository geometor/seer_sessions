Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid contains a background of white (0) pixels, one large contiguous object of a single color (red (2) in all examples), and several scattered single pixels of another color (azure (8), green (3), or yellow (4)).
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the scattered single pixels (markers) in their original positions. The original large object is present, but it's augmented. Specifically, certain entire rows and columns intersecting the original object's area are filled with the object's color, effectively expanding or thickening the object along these lines.
3.  **Key Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be identifying which rows and columns passing through the main object's bounding box should be "filled" with the main object's color.
4.  **Role of Marker Pixels:** The scattered single pixels (markers) act as inhibitors. If a marker pixel exists anywhere in a specific row, that row (within the bounds of the original object's vertical extent) is *not* fully painted with the main object's color. Similarly, if a marker pixel exists anywhere in a column, that column (within the bounds of the original object's horizontal extent) is *not* fully painted.
5.  **Filling Logic:** Rows and columns that *do not* contain any marker pixels *and* pass through the bounding box of the original main object are filled entirely across the grid with the main object's color. The original main object's pixels are preserved, and the marker pixels are preserved, potentially overwriting parts of the filled lines or the original object where they coincide.
6.  **Object Identification:** The task requires identifying the largest contiguous non-background object (pattern object) and the set of other non-background pixels (marker pixels).
7.  **Coordinate System:** The operation relies on the absolute row and column indices of the marker pixels and the bounding box of the pattern object.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the largest contiguous object of a single non-white color in the input grid. This is the "pattern object". Note its color (C) and determine its bounding box (min/max row/column indices).
2.  Identify all other non-white pixels in the input grid. These are the "marker pixels". Note their color(s) (M) and their locations (row and column indices).
3.  Create a set `R_marker` containing the row indices of all marker pixels.
4.  Create a set `C_marker` containing the column indices of all marker pixels.
5.  Initialize a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
6.  Iterate through all rows `r` from the minimum row to the maximum row of the pattern object's bounding box. If row index `r` is *not* present in the set `R_marker`, fill the *entire* row `r` of the output grid with the pattern object's color (C).
7.  Iterate through all columns `c` from the minimum column to the maximum column of the pattern object's bounding box. If column index `c` is *not* present in the set `C_marker`, fill the *entire* column `c` of the output grid with the pattern object's color (C).
8.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the input grid. If the input cell `(r, c)` was part of the original pattern object (i.e., had color C), set the corresponding output cell `(r, c)` to color C. (This ensures the original shape is preserved on top of the drawn lines).
9.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the input grid. If the input cell `(r, c)` was a marker pixel (i.e., had color M), set the corresponding output cell `(r, c)` to color M. (This ensures markers are preserved and appear on top of any lines or the pattern object).
