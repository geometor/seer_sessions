            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because the logic for filling the background was incorrect. It assumed that any cell whose row and column were *not* inhibited by a marker should be filled with the pattern color. This resulted in overfilling compared to the expected outputs.\n\nThe analysis of the failed examples suggests a different rule: the pattern color should be projected *only* along the rows and columns originally occupied by the pattern object. This projection is blocked if the specific row or column contains a marker pixel. The original pattern object and marker pixels are then overlaid onto this projected background.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Correctly identify the pattern object (largest contiguous non-white object) and marker pixels (all other non-white pixels).\n2.  Determine the rows and columns occupied by the pattern object.\n3.  Determine the rows and columns inhibited by marker pixels.\n4.  Implement the new filling logic: Fill a cell `(r, c)` with the pattern color *if* the cell's row `r` OR column `c` was part of the original pattern's footprint, AND *neither* row `r` nor column `c` is inhibited by a marker.\n5.  Overlay the original pattern and markers.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's confirm the identification of pattern objects, markers, and their coordinate extents for each example.\n\n"
