*   **Perception:** The input grids contain a primary rectangular object outlined by blue pixels (1). Inside this blue frame, there are various other colored pixels forming patterns. Outside the blue frame, in the white background (0), there are scattered pixels matching some of the colors found inside the frame. The output grid corresponds exactly to the area defined by the blue frame in the input, including the frame itself and its internal contents. The scattered pixels outside the frame and the surrounding white background are discarded.

*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid.
    2.  Find the largest connected component among these non-white pixels. This component represents the main rectangular object, including its blue border and internal contents.
    3.  Determine the bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column) of this largest connected component.
    4.  Extract the subgrid from the input grid defined by this bounding box.
    5.  The extracted subgrid is the final output.
