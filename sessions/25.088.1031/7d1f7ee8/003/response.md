"""
Identifies solid-color rectangular frames and fills their interiors based on specific rules.
1. Find all rectangular frames: A frame is a connected component of a single non-white color where all its pixels lie exactly on the perimeter of its bounding box, and the bounding box has both height > 1 and width > 1.
2. Sort frames by area: Calculate the area of each frame's bounding box and sort the frames from smallest area to largest.
3. Fill interiors sequentially: Iterate through the sorted frames (smallest first). For each frame, iterate through the pixels strictly inside its bounding box (the interior). If an interior pixel's color in the *original* input grid was not white (0), change its color in the *output* grid to the color of the current frame being processed. This allows smaller, inner frames to determine the color first, which might then be overwritten by larger, outer frames if the pixel is also inside the larger frame's interior.
4. Preserve original pixels: Pixels on the frames themselves, white pixels inside frames, and pixels outside all frames retain their original colors.
