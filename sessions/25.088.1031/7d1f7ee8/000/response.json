Inside these frames, there might be other shapes or patterns made of different non-white colors. The background color is white (0). The transformation involves filling the area *inside* each frame. Specifically, any non-white pixel located strictly within the boundaries of a frame is replaced with the color of that frame. The frames themselves and any pixels outside the frames remain unchanged. If multiple frames exist, this process is applied independently to the interior of each frame.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
