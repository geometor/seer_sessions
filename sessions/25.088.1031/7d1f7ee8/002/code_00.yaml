task_description: Find all solid-color rectangular frames and fill their interiors.
observations:
  - The input grid contains multiple objects, primarily rectangular frames made of a single non-white color.
  - Frames can be nested inside other frames.
  - Frames are defined by a contiguous perimeter of cells of the same non-white color that exactly matches their bounding box.
  - The minimum size for a shape to be considered a frame appears to be greater than 1x1 (i.e., width > 1 and height > 1).
  - The interior of a frame is the rectangular area strictly inside its perimeter.
transformation:
  - Identify all rectangular frames based on the perimeter definition.
  - Determine the interior region for each frame (rows r1+1 to r2-1, cols c1+1 to c2-1).
  - Create a copy of the input grid for the output.
  - Process the identified frames, ordered by their area (smallest area first).
  - For each frame:
    - Iterate through all pixels (r, c) within its interior region.
    - Check the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the *original input grid*.
    - If the original color is not white (0), change the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the *output grid* to the color of the current frame being processed.
  - Pixels on the frame perimeters remain unchanged.
  - White pixels (0) inside frames remain unchanged.
  - Pixels outside all frames remain unchanged.
notes:
  - The order of processing frames (smallest area first) is crucial for handling nested frames correctly, ensuring inner frames' colors are set before potentially being overwritten by larger, outer frames.
  - The frame detection must *not* consider the interior content (hollowness check was incorrect). It only depends on the shape of the single-color component matching its bounding box perimeter.
