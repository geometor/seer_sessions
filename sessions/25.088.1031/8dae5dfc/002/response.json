            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided Python code attempts to solve the task by identifying connected objects, detecting nested layers within them, and swapping the colors of these layers symmetrically (outermost with innermost, etc.). However, the code fails on all training examples, producing outputs that do not match the expected results.\n\nThe core hypothesis \u2013 that the transformation involves identifying nested layers within objects and symmetrically swapping their colors \u2013 appears correct upon visual inspection of the input/output pairs. The failure likely stems from the implementation of the layer detection algorithm.\n\nThe current code identifies layers by repeatedly finding pixels on the boundary of the *remaining* object part (pixels adjacent to non-object pixels). This \"peeling\" method seems flawed, potentially misidentifying layers, especially with non-convex shapes or layers that touch both the background and the next inner layer simultaneously. The resulting layer sequences and color assignments are incorrect.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Layer Detection:** Implement a new layer detection method. A promising approach is to define layers sequentially from the outside in:\n    *   Layer 1: All object pixels adjacent to the background (color 0).\n    *   Layer 2: All remaining object pixels adjacent to Layer 1.\n    *   Layer 3: All remaining object pixels adjacent to Layer 2.\n    *   ...and so on.\n2.  **Verify Layer Colors:** Ensure that each layer identified by this method consists of pixels of a single color in the input grid. This seems consistent with the examples.\n3.  **Implement Color Swapping:** Once the layers and their original colors are correctly identified in sequence (L1, L2, ..., Ln with colors C1, C2, ..., Cn), create the reversed color sequence (Cn, ..., C2, C1). Then, assign the new colors to the pixels of each layer in the output grid (L1 gets Cn, L2 gets C(n-1), ..., Ln gets C1).\n4.  **Re-test:** Apply the refined algorithm to all training examples to confirm correctness.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\nBased on visual analysis and the refined layer detection logic proposed above:\n\n*   **Object Identification:** The task involves processing distinct connected components (objects) of non-white pixels independently.\n*   **Layer Structure:** Each object consists of nested layers. A layer is a set of connected pixels of the same color. Layers are ordered from outermost to innermost.\n    *   The outermost layer (Layer 1) consists of object pixels adjacent to the white background (0).\n    *   Each subsequent layer (Layer `k`) consists of the remaining object pixels adjacent to the pixels of the previous layer (Layer `k-1`).\n*   **Color Swapping:** The transformation swaps the colors of these layers symmetrically. If an object has `n` layers with original colors `C1, C2, ..., Cn` (from outermost to innermost), the output object will have layers with colors `Cn, C(n-1), ..., C1` assigned to the original layer shapes `L1, L2, ..., Ln`, respectively.\n\n**Example Breakdown (Using Refined Logic):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Object 1 (Left): Input Layers [azure(8), orange(7), yellow(4), green(3)]. Output Layers [green(3), yellow(4), orange(7), azure(8)].\n    *   Object 2 (Right): Input Layers [red(2), blue(1), green(3)]. Output Layers [green(3), blue(1), red(2)].\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Object 1: Input Layers [blue(1), green(3), azure(8), red(2)]. Output Layers [red(2), azure(8), green(3), blue(1)].\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Object 1 (Top-Left): Input Layers [azure(8), red(2), blue(1)]. Output Layers [blue(1), red(2), azure(8)].\n    *   Object 2 (Bottom-Right): Input Layers [magenta(6), green(3), yellow(4), red(2), blue(1)]. Output Layers [blue(1), red(2), yellow(4), green(3), magenta(6)].\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Object 1 (Top): Input Layers [blue(1), magenta(6), azure(8)]. Output Layers [azure(8), magenta(6), blue(1)].\n    *   Object 2 (Bottom): Input Layers [red(2), yellow(4), blue(1), azure(8)]. Output Layers [azure(8), blue(1), yellow(4), red(2)].\n\nThe code execution results show that the previous implementation failed to correctly identify these layers and perform the swap, leading to significant pixel differences.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
