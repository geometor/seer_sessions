These structures appear to be composed of nested rectangular frames or layers.\n2.  **Object 1 (Left):** This object has an outermost frame of azure (8), followed by orange (7), then yellow (4), and finally an innermost area of green (3).\n3.  **Object 2 (Right):** This object has an outermost frame of red (2), followed by blue (1), and an innermost area of green (3).\n4.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid mirrors the input grid's structure, containing two objects in the same positions.\n5.  **Output Object 1 (Left):** The colors have changed. The outermost frame is now green (3), followed by yellow (4), then orange (7), and the innermost area is azure (8).\n6.  **Output Object 2 (Right):** The outermost frame is now green (3), followed by blue (1), and the innermost area is red (2).\n7.  **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing the input and output objects, the shapes and positions remain identical. The change lies entirely in the colors of the layers. For each object, the colors of the layers appear to be symmetrically swapped. The outermost layer's color swaps with the innermost layer's color, the second outermost with the second innermost, and so on. If there's a central layer (like the blue layer in Object 2), its color remains unchanged. The white background pixels are unaffected.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
