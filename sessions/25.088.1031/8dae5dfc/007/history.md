"""
Transforms the input grid by processing each distinct non-background object. For each object, it identifies its nested layers by iteratively "peeling" from the outermost layer inwards based on adjacency to pixels outside the currently remaining part of the object. It then swaps the colors of these layers symmetrically, assigning the innermost layer's original color to the outermost layer in the output, the second innermost color to the second outermost layer, and so on.

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Identify all distinct connected components (objects) formed by non-white (0) pixels using 4-way adjacency.
3. For each identified object:
    a. Initialize an empty list `layers_data` to store pairs of (set_of_layer_pixels, layer_color).
    b. Initialize `remaining_object_pixels` with the coordinates of all pixels in the current object.
    c. **Iteratively Identify Layers (Peeling):**
        i. While `remaining_object_pixels` is not empty:
            A. Find all pixels in `remaining_object_pixels` that have at least one neighbor (4-way adjacent) which is *not* currently in `remaining_object_pixels`. These neighbors can be background pixels (0) or pixels belonging to previously identified layers of the *same* object.
            B. Store these identified pixels as `current_layer_pixels`.
            C. If `current_layer_pixels` is empty but `remaining_object_pixels` is not (e.g., disconnected inner core after peeling), treat all remaining pixels as the last layer.
            D. If `current_layer_pixels` is empty (and `remaining_object_pixels` is also empty), break the inner loop.
            E. Determine the `layer_color` from the first pixel in `current_layer_pixels` (assuming uniform color per layer based on examples).
            F. Append the tuple (`current_layer_pixels`, `layer_color`) to `layers_data`.
            G. Remove `current_layer_pixels` from `remaining_object_pixels`.
    d. **Swap Colors:**
        i. Extract the sequence of original colors from `layers_data`: `original_colors = [color for _, color in layers_data]`.
        ii. Create a reversed sequence: `reversed_colors = original_colors[::-1]`.
        iii. Iterate through the `layers_data` and `reversed_colors`. For the i-th layer (`layer_pixels`, _) in `layers_data`, get the i-th color from `reversed_colors`.
        iv. Update the `output_grid`: For each pixel (r, c) in `layer_pixels`, set `output_grid[r, c]` to the corresponding `reversed_color`.
4. Return the modified `output_grid`.

Okay, let's analyze the previous results and refine our understanding.

## General Assessment

The previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying objects, "peeling" them layer by layer from the outside, and reversing the order of the layer colors. The results show that this approach failed on all training examples, producing outputs that were significantly different from the expected ones.

The key issue likely lies in the "peeling" algorithm for layer identification. This method seems too simplistic and might not correctly handle the geometry of the layers, especially for non-convex shapes, shapes with holes, or varying layer thicknesses, as seen in the examples. The transformed outputs often show incorrect colors assigned to large portions of the objects, suggesting the layer boundaries or the assignment process was flawed.

The strategy going forward is to redefine how layers are identified. A more robust approach might be to define layers based on their distance from the "outside" of the object (i.e., distance from the nearest non-object pixel). We will re-analyze the examples with this new perspective to build a more accurate transformation rule.

## Metrics Gathering

We'll analyze the structure based on the hypothesis that layers are defined by distance from the nearest non-object pixel (using 4-way adjacency).

*   **Object Identification:** In all examples, objects are contiguous regions of non-white (0) pixels, using 4-way adjacency. The background is white(0). The number of distinct objects is preserved between input and output for each example.
*   **Layer Definition (Hypothesized):** Layers are sets of pixels within an object equidistant from the nearest pixel *outside* the object.
    *   Layer 1: Pixels adjacent (4-way) to a non-object pixel.
    *   Layer 2: Pixels adjacent to Layer 1 pixels (and not in Layer 1).
    *   Layer k: Pixels adjacent to Layer (k-1) pixels (and not in Layers 1 to k-1).
*   **Color Transformation (Hypothesized):** The sequence of original colors corresponding to the layers (Layer 1, Layer 2, ..., Layer N) is collected. This sequence is reversed. The reversed sequence is then applied back to the layers: Layer 1 gets the color of original Layer N, Layer 2 gets the color of original Layer N-1, ..., Layer N gets the color of original Layer 1.

Let's verify this hypothesis against the examples:

**Example 1:**
*   Input Objects: 2. Output Objects: 2.
*   Object 1 (Left):
    *   Input Layers (by distance): 1:azure(8), 2:orange(7), 3:yellow(4), 4:green(3). Colors: `[8, 7, 4, 3]`
    *   Reversed Colors: `[3, 4, 7, 8]`
    *   Expected Output Layers (by distance): 1:green(3), 2:yellow(4), 3:orange(7), 4:azure(8). Matches.
*   Object 2 (Right):
    *   Input Layers (by distance): 1:red(2), 2:blue(1), 3:green(3). Colors: `[2, 1, 3]`
    *   Reversed Colors: `[3, 1, 2]`
    *   Expected Output Layers (by distance): 1:green(3), 2:blue(1), 3:red(2). Matches.

**Example 2:**
*   Input Objects: 1. Output Objects: 1.
*   Object 1:
    *   Input Layers (by distance): 1:blue(1), 2:green(3), 3:azure(8), 4:red(2). Colors: `[1, 3, 8, 2]`
    *   Reversed Colors: `[2, 8, 3, 1]`
    *   Expected Output Layers (by distance): 1:red(2), 2:azure(8), 3:green(3), 4:blue(1). Matches.

**Example 3:**
*   Input Objects: 2. Output Objects: 2.
*   Object 1 (Top):
    *   Input Layers (by distance): 1:azure(8), 2:red(2), 3:blue(1). Colors: `[8, 2, 1]`
    *   Reversed Colors: `[1, 2, 8]`
    *   Expected Output Layers (by distance): 1:blue(1), 2:red(2), 3:azure(8). Matches.
*   Object 2 (Bottom):
    *   Input Layers (by distance): 1:magenta(6), 2:green(3), 3:yellow(4), 4:red(2), 5:blue(1). Colors: `[6, 3, 4, 2, 1]`
    *   Reversed Colors: `[1, 2, 4, 3, 6]`
    *   Expected Output Layers (by distance): 1:blue(1), 2:red(2), 3:yellow(4), 4:green(3), 5:magenta(6). Matches.

**Example 4:**
*   Input Objects: 2. Output Objects: 2.
*   Object 1 (Top):
    *   Input Layers (by distance): 1:blue(1), 2:magenta(6), 3:azure(8). Colors: `[1, 6, 8]`
    *   Reversed Colors: `[8, 6, 1]`
    *   Expected Output Layers (by distance): 1:azure(8), 2:magenta(6), 3:blue(1). Matches.
*   Object 2 (Bottom):
    *   Input Layers (by distance): 1:red(2), 2:yellow(4), 3:blue(1), 4:azure(8). Colors: `[2, 4, 1, 8]`
    *   Reversed Colors: `[8, 1, 4, 2]`
    *   Expected Output Layers (by distance): 1:azure(8), 2:blue(1), 3:yellow(4), 4:red(2). Matches.

The distance-based layer definition consistently explains the transformation in all examples. The previous code's failures were due to an incorrect layer identification method.

    ambiguity_note: "The examples show layers with uniform color. If a layer had mixed colors, the rule for selecting the representative color would need clarification, but based on examples, we take the color present in that layer."

actions:
  - name: color_reversal
    input: layer_colors # [C1, C2, ..., CN]
    output: reversed_layer_colors # [CN, ..., C2, C1]
    description: "The sequence of original layer colors is reversed."
  - name: recolor_object
    target: each object
    process: "Iterate through the layers L1 to LN. Assign the first color from reversed_layer_colors to all pixels in L1, the second color to all pixels in L2, ..., the Nth color to all pixels in LN."
    result: "The object retains its shape but its layer colors are symmetrically swapped from outside-in."

workflow:
  - step: Identify all distinct non-background objects in the input grid.
  - step: For each object:
      - Determine the layers L1, L2, ..., LN based on pixel distance to the exterior.
      - Extract the original color sequence C1, C2, ..., CN from these layers.
      - Reverse the color sequence to get CN, ..., C2, C1.
      - Create a mapping: Layer Lk maps to new color C(N-k+1).
  - step: Construct the output grid by applying the new color mapping to the pixels of each object's layers. Keep background pixels unchanged.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all separate connected components (objects) of non-white pixels in the input grid using 4-way adjacency. Treat white pixels (color 0) as the background.
2.  **Process Each Object:** For every object identified:
    a.  **Calculate Distances:** Determine the shortest distance (using 4-way steps) from each pixel within the object to the nearest pixel *outside* the object (either a background pixel or a pixel belonging to a different object).
    b.  **Define Layers:** Group the object's pixels into layers based on this distance. Layer 1 contains pixels at distance 1, Layer 2 contains pixels at distance 2, and so on, up to the maximum distance N found within the object.
    c.  **Extract Original Colors:** Create an ordered list of the original colors of these layers, typically by taking the color of any pixel in that layer (assuming layers are monochromatic as per examples): `[Color(Layer1), Color(Layer2), ..., Color(LayerN)]`.
    d.  **Reverse Color Sequence:** Reverse this list of colors: `[Color(LayerN), ..., Color(Layer2), Color(Layer1)]`.
    e.  **Recolor Layers:** Update the colors of the object's pixels in the output grid. All pixels originally in Layer 1 should now have the first color from the reversed sequence (original Color(LayerN)). Pixels in Layer 2 get the second color from the reversed sequence (original Color(LayerN-1)), and so forth, until pixels in Layer N get the last color from the reversed sequence (original Color(Layer1)).
3.  **Combine Results:** Ensure all objects are processed and updated in the output grid. Background pixels remain unchanged.
4.  **Return:** Output the final modified grid.
