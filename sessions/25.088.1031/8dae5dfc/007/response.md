"""
Transforms the input grid by processing each distinct non-background object. 
For each object, it identifies concentric layers based on the 4-way distance 
from each pixel within the object to the nearest pixel outside the object. 
It then extracts the original color sequence of these layers (from outermost 
to innermost) and reverses this sequence. Finally, it recolors the object 
by applying the reversed color sequence back onto the layers (innermost 
original color goes to outermost layer, etc.).

Workflow:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Identify all distinct connected components (objects) formed by non-white (0) pixels using 4-way adjacency.
3. For each identified object:
    a. Calculate the 4-way distance for each pixel within the object to the nearest pixel *outside* the object using a multi-source BFS starting from the exterior boundary.
    b. Group the object's pixels into layers based on their calculated distance (Layer 1 = distance 1, Layer 2 = distance 2, etc.).
    c. Determine the original color associated with each layer (assuming layers are mostly monochromatic based on examples). Store the sequence of colors [Color(L1), Color(L2), ..., Color(LN)].
    d. Reverse the sequence of original colors: [Color(LN), ..., Color(L2), Color(L1)].
    e. Update the output grid: For each layer Lk (pixels at distance k), assign the k-th color from the *reversed* sequence.
4. Return the modified output grid.
