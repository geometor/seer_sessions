task_description: Transforms blue pixels based on the horizontal span of a unique trigger object.

definitions:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
    description: Represents the input and output states.
  - name: white
    value: 0
    description: Background color, generally ignored unless part of an object.
  - name: blue
    value: 1
    description: The color of pixels targeted for transformation.
  - name: trigger_color
    type: integer (2-9)
    description: The single unique color in the input grid that is not white (0) or blue (1). This color determines the transformation.
  - name: trigger_object
    type: set of pixels
    description: All pixels in the input grid matching the trigger_color.
  - name: trigger_columns
    type: range of integers
    description: The range of column indices from the minimum column index to the maximum column index occupied by any pixel of the trigger_object.

transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify the trigger_color
    details: Scan the input grid to find the unique color that is not 0 (white) or 1 (blue).
  - step: 2
    action: Identify the trigger_object pixels
    details: Find all coordinates (row, column) where the pixel color equals the trigger_color.
  - step: 3
    action: Determine the trigger_columns
    details: Find the minimum and maximum column index among all trigger_object pixels.
  - step: 4
    action: Create the output grid
    details: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: 5
    action: Apply transformation within trigger_columns
    details: Iterate through each pixel of the grid. If a pixel's column index falls within the trigger_columns (inclusive) and its color in the input grid is blue (1), change its color in the output grid to the trigger_color. Otherwise, the pixel retains its original color from the input grid.

constraints:
  - There is always exactly one trigger_color per input grid.
  - The trigger_object may consist of one or more pixels, possibly non-contiguous, but sharing the same trigger_color.
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
