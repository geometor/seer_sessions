task_description: Change the color of blue pixels based on the row and column span of a unique 'trigger' object.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  value_range: 0-9 (colors)
  background_color: Typically white (0), but can contain other structures.
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The primary background color, often separating other objects.
  - type: target
    color: blue (1)
    description: The pixels whose color might be changed. Often appear in patterns (e.g., stripes).
  - type: trigger
    color: unique non-white(0), non-blue(1) color
    description: A contiguous or non-contiguous set of pixels of a single unique color (e.g., red(2), green(3)) that determines the transformation area. There is only one such color per input grid.
    properties:
      - min_row: The minimum row index occupied by any trigger pixel.
      - max_row: The maximum row index occupied by any trigger pixel.
      - min_col: The minimum column index occupied by any trigger pixel.
      - max_col: The maximum column index occupied by any trigger pixel.
transformation:
  action: Recolor pixels
  source_pixels: Blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
  target_pixels: Pixels in the output grid corresponding to source pixels.
  condition: A blue pixel is recolored if its row index is between the trigger object's min_row and max_row (inclusive) OR if its column index is between the trigger object's min_col and max_col (inclusive).
  new_color: The color of the trigger object.
  unaffected_pixels:
    - White (0) pixels remain white.
    - Trigger object pixels retain their color.
    - Blue (1) pixels *not* meeting the row/column condition remain blue.
    - Any other pixels present remain unchanged.
constraints:
  - There is exactly one unique trigger color (not 0 or 1) in each input grid.
  - The trigger object may consist of multiple disconnected pixels of the same trigger color, but the transformation considers the overall bounding box (min/max row/col) covering all of them.
