"""
Transforms blue pixels (1) based on the row OR column span of a unique 'trigger' object.

The trigger object is defined by the single unique color in the input grid that is not white (0) or blue (1).
Find the bounding box (min/max row and min/max column) encompassing all pixels of the trigger color.
All blue pixels located in a row within the trigger's row span OR in a column within the trigger's column span are changed to match the color of the trigger object. All other pixels remain unchanged.
