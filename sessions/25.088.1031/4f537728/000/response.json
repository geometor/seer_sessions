They feature a repeating background pattern consisting of vertical blue (1) lines separated by white (0) columns, and horizontal white (0) lines separating blocks of the vertical pattern.\n2.  **Key Object:** In each input grid, there's a single, small (2x2), contiguous block of a unique color that isn't blue (1) or white (0). In `train_1`, this object is red (2). In `train_2`, it's green (3). Let's call this the \"trigger object\".\n3.  **Transformation:** The primary change between input and output involves the color blue (1). Specifically, blue pixels located in the same *rows* as the trigger object change their color to match the color of the trigger object.\n4.  **Locality:** The change is horizontally localized. Only blue pixels within the horizontal band defined by the trigger object's rows are affected.\n5.  **Consistency:** All other pixels, including the white background, the horizontal white lines, the trigger object itself, and blue pixels outside the affected rows, remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
