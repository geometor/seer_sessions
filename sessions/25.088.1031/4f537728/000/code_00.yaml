task: color_propagation_horizontal
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: repeating_pattern
    description: Vertical blue (1) lines separated by white (0), with horizontal white (0) separators.
    color: blue (1), white (0)
  - type: trigger_object
    description: A single contiguous block of a unique color (not white or blue).
    properties:
      - color: C (e.g., red(2) in train_1, green(3) in train_2)
      - shape: square (2x2 in examples)
      - location: defines a specific set of rows
    relationship: Its color and row position determine the transformation.
actions:
  - name: identify_trigger_object
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: trigger_object_color (C), trigger_object_rows (min_row, max_row)
  - name: apply_color_change
    inputs: input_grid, trigger_object_color (C), trigger_object_rows (min_row, max_row)
    outputs: output_grid
    rule: Iterate through input_grid. If a pixel is blue (1) and its row is within [min_row, max_row], change its color to C in the output. Otherwise, copy the input pixel color.
relationship:
  - The transformation modifies blue pixels based on the color and row position of the trigger object. Blue pixels adopt the trigger object's color if they share the same row(s).
