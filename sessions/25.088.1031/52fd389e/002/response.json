            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the yellow objects, their bounding boxes, and the associated \"internal\" color within each bounding box. It also correctly determined the coordinates of an expanded bounding box (one pixel larger in all directions).\n\nHowever, the transformation logic was flawed. The code filled *all* originally white pixels within the expanded bounding box with the internal color. The analysis of the expected outputs reveals that the transformation should instead draw a *frame* or *perimeter* around the original bounding box, using the internal color. This frame occupies the exact area defined by the expanded bounding box, but only the outermost layer of pixels in that expanded box is colored. Furthermore, the frame color overwrites any existing pixel color on that perimeter in the output grid, not just white pixels.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the transformation step to iterate only through the perimeter cells of the expanded bounding box and color them with the associated internal color, overwriting the original content of those cells in the output grid.\n\n## Metrics\n\nWe can confirm the core components identified in the previous attempt: yellow objects, their bounding boxes, and internal colors. The main difference lies in how the output area is constructed.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 25x25\n*   Yellow Object 1: BBox (2, 2) to (7, 7). Internal Color: 2 (red). Expanded BBox: (1, 1) to (8, 8).\n*   Yellow Object 2: BBox (15, 13) to (20, 21). Internal Color: 1 (blue). Expanded BBox: (14, 12) to (21, 22).\n*   Output Frame 1: Perimeter of (1, 1) to (8, 8), filled with red (2).\n*   Output Frame 2: Perimeter of (14, 12) to (21, 22), filled with blue (1).\n*   Previous Code Mismatch: Filled the interior of the expanded bounding boxes instead of just the perimeter.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 25x25\n*   Yellow Object 1: BBox (2, 3) to (4, 5). Internal Color: 3 (green). Expanded BBox: (1, 2) to (5, 6).\n*   Yellow Object 2: BBox (12, 11) to (17, 18). Internal Color: 2 (red). Expanded BBox: (11, 10) to (18, 19).\n*   Output Frame 1: Perimeter of (1, 2) to (5, 6), filled with green (3).\n*   Output Frame 2: Perimeter of (11, 10) to (18, 19), filled with red (2).\n*   Previous Code Mismatch: Filled the interior of the expanded bounding boxes instead of just the perimeter.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 25x25\n*   Yellow Object 1: BBox (2, 6) to (5, 9). Internal Color: 1 (blue). Expanded BBox: (1, 5) to (6, 10).\n*   Yellow Object 2: BBox (12, 8) to (19, 17). Internal Color: 8 (azure). Expanded BBox: (11, 7) to (20, 18).\n*   Output Frame 1: Perimeter of (1, 5) to (6, 10), filled with blue (1).\n*   Output Frame 2: Perimeter of (11, 7) to (20, 18), filled with azure (8).\n*   Previous Code Mismatch: Filled the interior of the expanded bounding boxes instead of just the perimeter.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
