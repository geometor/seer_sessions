## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified the yellow objects, their bounding boxes, and the associated "internal" color within each bounding box. It also correctly determined the coordinates of an expanded bounding box (one pixel larger in all directions).

However, the transformation logic was flawed. The code filled *all* originally white pixels within the expanded bounding box with the internal color. The analysis of the expected outputs reveals that the transformation should instead draw a *frame* or *perimeter* around the original bounding box, using the internal color. This frame occupies the exact area defined by the expanded bounding box, but only the outermost layer of pixels in that expanded box is colored. Furthermore, the frame color overwrites any existing pixel color on that perimeter in the output grid, not just white pixels.

The strategy is to modify the transformation step to iterate only through the perimeter cells of the expanded bounding box and color them with the associated internal color, overwriting the original content of those cells in the output grid.

## Metrics

We can confirm the core components identified in the previous attempt: yellow objects, their bounding boxes, and internal colors. The main difference lies in how the output area is constructed.

**Example 1:**
*   Input Grid Size: 25x25
*   Yellow Object 1: BBox (2, 2) to (7, 7). Internal Color: 2 (red). Expanded BBox: (1, 1) to (8, 8).
*   Yellow Object 2: BBox (15, 13) to (20, 21). Internal Color: 1 (blue). Expanded BBox: (14, 12) to (21, 22).
*   Output Frame 1: Perimeter of (1, 1) to (8, 8), filled with red (2).
*   Output Frame 2: Perimeter of (14, 12) to (21, 22), filled with blue (1).
*   Previous Code Mismatch: Filled the interior of the expanded bounding boxes instead of just the perimeter.

**Example 2:**
*   Input Grid Size: 25x25
*   Yellow Object 1: BBox (2, 3) to (4, 5). Internal Color: 3 (green). Expanded BBox: (1, 2) to (5, 6).
*   Yellow Object 2: BBox (12, 11) to (17, 18). Internal Color: 2 (red). Expanded BBox: (11, 10) to (18, 19).
*   Output Frame 1: Perimeter of (1, 2) to (5, 6), filled with green (3).
*   Output Frame 2: Perimeter of (11, 10) to (18, 19), filled with red (2).
*   Previous Code Mismatch: Filled the interior of the expanded bounding boxes instead of just the perimeter.

**Example 3:**
*   Input Grid Size: 25x25
*   Yellow Object 1: BBox (2, 6) to (5, 9). Internal Color: 1 (blue). Expanded BBox: (1, 5) to (6, 10).
*   Yellow Object 2: BBox (12, 8) to (19, 17). Internal Color: 8 (azure). Expanded BBox: (11, 7) to (20, 18).
*   Output Frame 1: Perimeter of (1, 5) to (6, 10), filled with blue (1).
*   Output Frame 2: Perimeter of (11, 7) to (20, 18), filled with azure (8).
*   Previous Code Mismatch: Filled the interior of the expanded bounding boxes instead of just the perimeter.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: "For each connected yellow object in the input grid, find a unique non-yellow, non-white pixel within its bounding box. Determine the bounding box of the yellow object. Create a frame one pixel thick surrounding this bounding box, colored with the found unique color. This frame overwrites existing pixels."

grid_properties:
  size: Variable (up to 30x30)
  colors: 0-9 mapped to specific colors. White (0) is background. Yellow (4) is the primary object identifier.

objects:
  - type: Primary Object
    color: 4 (Yellow)
    shape: Contiguous block (connected including diagonals)
    properties:
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing the object.
      - internal_color_pixel: A pixel within the bounding box whose color is not Yellow (4) and not White (0). There might be multiple pixels of this color, but the color itself is unique per yellow object in the examples.

actions:
  - name: Identify Primary Objects
    input: grid
    output: List of yellow objects (sets of coordinates)
    condition: Find all distinct connected components of yellow pixels.

  - name: Determine Properties for each Primary Object
    input: grid, yellow_object_coordinates
    output: bounding_box, internal_color
    steps:
      - Calculate the bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) from object coordinates.
      - Search within the bounding box in the input grid for the first pixel that is not yellow (4) and not white (0). Record its color as internal_color.

  - name: Construct Output Frame
    input: input_grid, bounding_box, internal_color
    output: modified_grid
    steps:
      - Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid.
      - Calculate the expanded bounding box coordinates (frame boundaries):
          frame_min_r = max(0, min_row - 1)
          frame_min_c = max(0, min_col - 1)
          frame_max_r = min(grid_height - 1, max_row + 1)
          frame_max_c = min(grid_width - 1, max_col + 1)
      - Iterate through all cells (r, c) within the expanded bounding box (from frame_min_r to frame_max_r, frame_min_c to frame_max_c).
      - If the cell (r, c) is on the perimeter of the expanded bounding box (i.e., r == frame_min_r or r == frame_max_r or c == frame_min_c or c == frame_max_c):
          Set output_grid[r, c] = internal_color (overwriting the previous value).

final_output: The modified grid after processing all yellow objects. If multiple frames overlap, the later processed frame's color takes precedence in the overlapping region based on typical iteration order, although examples don't show complex overlaps.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct connected groups (objects) of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid, considering diagonal connections.
3.  For each identified yellow object:
    a.  Determine the minimum bounding box that encloses the yellow object. Let the corners be (min_row, min_col) and (max_row, max_col).
    b.  Search within this bounding box in the input grid to find the color of the first pixel encountered that is *not* yellow (4) and *not* white (0). This color is the 'frame color' for this object.
    c.  Calculate the coordinates for an expanded bounding box by extending the original bounding box by one pixel outwards in all directions, ensuring the coordinates stay within the grid boundaries. Let the corners of this expanded box be (frame_min_r, frame_min_c) and (frame_max_r, frame_max_c).
    d.  Iterate through all pixel coordinates (r, c) within the expanded bounding box (from frame_min_r to frame_max_r, and frame_min_c to frame_max_c).
    e.  If a pixel's row `r` equals `frame_min_r` or `frame_max_r`, OR if the pixel's column `c` equals `frame_min_c` or `frame_max_c`, then this pixel lies on the perimeter of the expanded bounding box.
    f.  Change the color of this perimeter pixel `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to the determined 'frame color'. This overwrites any color previously at that position in the output grid.
4.  Return the final modified output grid.
