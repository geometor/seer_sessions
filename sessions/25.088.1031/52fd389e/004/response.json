However, it incorrectly implemented the final step. Instead of coloring only the *perimeter* of an expanded bounding box, the transformation should color the *entire area* between the original bounding box and the expanded bounding box (a frame of thickness 1). The internal contents defined by the original bounding box should remain unchanged relative to the input, except where overwritten by the frame.\n\nThe strategy will be to adjust the final step of the transformation logic to fill this entire frame area rather than just its outer edge.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between the yellow objects, their internal colors, and the framing in the expected outputs.\n"

This differs from the other examples where the frame is consistently one pixel thick.\n\nLet's re-examine the inputs and outputs carefully.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Object 1 (Red): BBox (2, 2) to (7, 7). Expanded BBox (1, 1) to (8, 8). Output frame is (0,0) to (9,9). This is *two* pixels expansion. Internal color: Red (2).\n    *   Object 2 (Blue): BBox (15, 13) to (20, 20). Expanded BBox (14, 12) to (21, 21). Output frame is (12, 10) to (23, 22). This is *two* pixels expansion top/bottom, *three* pixels left/right? No, wait. MinC=13, MaxC=20. ExpMinC=12, ExpMaxC=21. Output frame MinC=10, MaxC=23. That's *three* pixels expansion left/right. Internal color: Blue (1).\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Object 1 (Green): BBox (2, 3) to (4, 5). Expanded BBox (1, 2) to (5, 6). Output frame is (1, 2) to (5, 6). This is *one* pixel expansion. Internal color: Green (3).\n    *   Object 2 (Red): BBox (12, 11) to (17, 17). Expanded BBox (11, 10) to (18, 18). Output frame is (9, 8) to (20, 21). This is *two* pixels top/bottom, *three* pixels left/right expansion. Internal color: Red (2).\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Object 1 (Blue): BBox (2, 6) to (5, 9). Expanded BBox (1, 5) to (6, 10). Output frame is (1, 5) to (6, 10). This is *one* pixel expansion. Internal color: Blue (1).\n    *   Object 2 (Azure): BBox (12, 8) to (19, 17). Expanded BBox (11, 7) to (20, 18). Output frame is (8, 4) to (23, 21). This is *three* pixels expansion top/bottom, *four* pixels left/right expansion. Internal color: Azure (8).\n\n**Revised Assessment:** The expansion amount is not constant! It varies per object. How is the expansion amount determined?\n\nLet's look at the internal color pixels relative to the bounding box.\n\n*   Ex 1, Obj 1 (Red): BBox (2,2)-(7,7). Red pixels at (3,3) and (6,5). Frame expansion: 2.\n*   Ex 1, Obj 2 (Blue): BBox (15,13)-(20,20). Blue pixels at (16,16), (18,14), (19,16). Frame expansion: 2/3.\n*   Ex 2, Obj 1 (Green): BBox (2,3)-(4,5). Green pixel at (3,4). Frame expansion: 1.\n*   Ex 2, Obj 2 (Red): BBox (12,11)-(17,17). Red pixels at (13,13), (15,16), (16,12). Frame expansion: 2/3.\n*   Ex 3, Obj 1 (Blue): BBox (2,6)-(5,9). Blue pixel at (3,7). Frame expansion: 1.\n*   Ex 3, Obj 2 (Azure): BBox (12,8)-(19,17). Azure pixels at (13,10), (14,14), (16,11), (18,14). Frame expansion: 3/4.\n\nIt appears the number of *internal non-yellow, non-white pixels* within the bounding box might determine the frame thickness (expansion amount).\n\n*   1 internal pixel -> Expansion 1 (Ex 2 Obj 1, Ex 3 Obj 1)\n*   2 internal pixels -> Expansion 2 (Ex 1 Obj 1)\n*   3 internal pixels -> Expansion 2/3? (Ex 1 Obj 2, Ex 2 Obj 2) - This doesn't fit simply. Let's re-calculate expansion for Ex1 Obj2: BBox (15,13)-(20,20). Output Frame (12,10)-(23,22). Expansion Top: 15-12=3. Expansion Bottom: 23-20=3. Expansion Left: 13-10=3. Expansion Right: 22-20=2. So it's 3 pixels top/bottom/left, 2 pixels right. Why?\nLet's re-calculate expansion for Ex2 Obj2: BBox (12,11)-(17,17). Output Frame (9,8)-(20,21). Expansion Top: 12-9=3. Expansion Bottom: 20-17=3. Expansion Left: 11-8=3. Expansion Right: 21-17=4. So it's 3 pixels top/bottom/left, 4 pixels right. Why?\n*   4 internal pixels -> Expansion 3/4 (Ex 3 Obj 2) - Re-calculate: BBox (12,8)-(19,17). Output Frame (8,4)-(23,21). Expansion Top: 12-8=4. Expansion Bottom: 23-19=4. Expansion Left: 8-4=4. Expansion Right: 21-17=4. So it's 4 pixels expansion all around.\n\nOkay, a new hypothesis: The expansion amount (frame thickness) is equal to the *count* of the internal non-yellow, non-white pixels associated with that yellow object.\n\n*   Ex 1, Obj 1: 2 red pixels -> Expansion 2. (Matches!)\n*   Ex 1, Obj 2: 3 blue pixels -> Expansion 3. (Matches Top/Bottom/Left, Right is 2... why? Output Frame Max Col is 22, BBox Max Col is 20. 22-20=2. Hmm. Let's check the output grid size: 25x25. ExpMaxCol = MaxCol + Exp = 20 + 3 = 23. The expected output stops at 22. Maybe the frame doesn't overwrite other frames/objects? No other objects nearby. Maybe boundary effects? Grid width is 25. MaxCol=20, Exp=3 -> 23. Output MaxCol=22. Maybe boundary clamp error in manual calc? Let's assume 3 for now.)\n*   Ex 2, Obj 1: 1 green pixel -> Expansion 1. (Matches!)\n*   Ex 2, Obj 2: 3 red pixels -> Expansion 3. (Matches Top/Bottom/Left, Right is 4... why? Output Frame Max Col is 21, BBox Max Col is 17. 21-17=4. ExpMaxCol = MaxCol + Exp = 17 + 3 = 20. Output goes to 21. This contradicts the previous discrepancy. Let's re-examine the code/concept. Maybe `find_internal_color` needs to count *all* pixels, not just return the first?)\n*   Ex 3, Obj 1: 1 blue pixel -> Expansion 1. (Matches!)\n*   Ex 3, Obj 2: 4 azure pixels -> Expansion 4. (Matches!)\n\nLet's modify the `find_internal_color` to return both the color and the count.\n\n"

Identify all separate connected groups of yellow pixels in the input grid. Consider pixels connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally as part of the same group.\n3.  For each identified yellow group:\n    a.  Determine the smallest rectangular bounding box that encloses all pixels of this yellow group.\n    b.  Look inside this bounding box in the input grid. Find all pixels that are *not* yellow and *not* white. Note their color (this will be the 'frame color') and count how many such pixels there are (this count is the 'frame thickness'). Assume all these pixels within one box have the same color.\n    c.  If a frame color was found:\n        i.  Calculate the coordinates of an expanded bounding box by extending the original bounding box outwards in all four directions (up, down, left, right) by a number of pixels equal to the 'frame thickness'. Ensure the expanded box does not go beyond the grid boundaries.\n        ii. Fill the area *between* the original bounding box and the expanded bounding box with the 'frame color'. Specifically, for every pixel coordinate within the expanded bounding box, if that coordinate is *outside* the original bounding box, set the color of that pixel in the output grid to the 'frame color', overwriting any previous color. Leave the pixels inside the original bounding box as they were in the input grid (unless they get overwritten by the frame if the frame thickness is large).\n4.  After processing all yellow groups, return the modified output grid."
