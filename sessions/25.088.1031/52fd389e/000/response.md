Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain one or more distinct rectangular or near-rectangular objects primarily composed of yellow (4) pixels. These yellow objects are scattered on a white (0) background.
2.  **Internal Pixels:** Within each yellow object, there are one or more pixels of a *different*, non-white color. In the examples, these internal colors are red (2), blue (1), green (3), and azure (8). Crucially, each yellow object appears to contain only *one* type of non-yellow, non-white internal color.
3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the original yellow objects and their internal colored pixels in the exact same positions.
4.  **Transformation:** The key transformation is the addition of a colored "frame" or "aura" around each original yellow object. The color of this frame matches the color of the internal pixel(s) found within that specific yellow object in the input.
5.  **Frame Definition:** The frame appears to be exactly one pixel thick, surrounding the bounding box of the original yellow object. It fills the area defined by expanding the bounding box by one pixel in all directions (including diagonals). Only pixels that were originally white (0) in the input grid and fall within this expanded bounding box are colored with the frame color.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - object: yellow_shape
    description: A contiguous region of yellow (4) pixels. Acts as a container.
    properties:
      - color: 4 (yellow)
      - shape: Roughly rectangular in examples, but defined by connectivity.
      - location: Defined by coordinates of its pixels.
      - bounding_box: The minimum rectangle enclosing the object.
    contains:
      - object: internal_pixel
        description: One or more pixels located within the bounding box of a yellow_shape, having a color different from yellow (4) and white (0).
        properties:
          - color: Varies (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 8 in examples). Defines the 'fill_color'.
          - location: Inside the corresponding yellow_shape.
  - object: background
    description: Pixels not part of any yellow_shape or its associated frame in the output.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)

    output: fill_color
    description: Find the color of the non-yellow, non-white pixel(s) inside the yellow_shape's bounding box. Assume a single unique color exists per shape based on examples.

  - action: create_frame
    actor: system
    input: expanded_box_coordinates, fill_color, input_grid, output_grid
    output: modified_output_grid
    description: Iterate through cells within the expanded_box. If a cell was white (0) in the input_grid, color it with the fill_color in the output_grid.

relationships:
  - type: containment
    from: yellow_shape
    to: internal_pixel
  - type: determines
    from: internal_pixel.color
    to: fill_color
  - type: surrounds
    from: frame (created by create_frame action)

state_change:
  - initial: Input grid with yellow shapes containing internal pixels on a white background.
  - final: Output grid identical to input, except for added frames around each yellow shape, colored according to their respective internal pixels.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct connected objects composed of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each yellow object found:
    a.  Determine the bounding box of the yellow object.
    b.  Search within this bounding box in the input grid to find the single color value (let's call it `fill_color`) that is present and is *not* yellow (4) and *not* white (0). (Based on the examples, assume only one such color exists per object).
    c.  Calculate the coordinates of an expanded bounding box by taking the original bounding box and extending it by one pixel in every direction (up, down, left, right, and diagonals), making sure not to go outside the overall grid dimensions.
    d.  Iterate through every grid cell (row, column) within this expanded bounding box.
    e.  For each cell within the expanded box, check its color in the *original input grid*. If the color in the input grid at this cell's location is white (0), then update the color of this cell in the *output grid* to be the `fill_color` determined in step 3b.
4.  Return the final modified output grid.
