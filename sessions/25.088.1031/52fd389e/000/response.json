            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain one or more distinct rectangular or near-rectangular objects primarily composed of yellow (4) pixels. These yellow objects are scattered on a white (0) background.\n2.  **Internal Pixels:** Within each yellow object, there are one or more pixels of a *different*, non-white color. In the examples, these internal colors are red (2), blue (1), green (3), and azure (8). Crucially, each yellow object appears to contain only *one* type of non-yellow, non-white internal color.\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the original yellow objects and their internal colored pixels in the exact same positions.\n4.  **Transformation:** The key transformation is the addition of a colored \"frame\" or \"aura\" around each original yellow object. The color of this frame matches the color of the internal pixel(s) found within that specific yellow object in the input.\n5.  **Frame Definition:** The frame appears to be exactly one pixel thick, surrounding the bounding box of the original yellow object. It fills the area defined by expanding the bounding box by one pixel in all directions (including diagonals). Only pixels that were originally white (0) in the input grid and fall within this expanded bounding box are colored with the frame color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
