"""
Transforms an input grid by:
1. Finding all contiguous objects of non-background colors (white, 0).
2. Calculating the size (pixel count), bounding box (min/max row/col), and 
   center coordinates for each object.
3. Sorting all found objects by size in descending order.
4. Examining the colors of the 9 largest objects.
5. Determining the number of objects to select (N) and the output grid shape:
   - If the number of *unique* colors among the 9 largest objects is 6 or more, 
     select the top N=6 largest objects, and the output shape is 2x3.
   - Otherwise, select the top N=9 largest objects, and the output shape is 3x3.
6. Taking the selected N largest objects.
7. Sorting these N objects based on their spatial position: primarily by their 
   topmost row coordinate (minimum row index of the bounding box) and 
   secondarily by their horizontal center coordinate (average column index).
8. Extracting the colors of these spatially sorted N objects in order.
9. Reshaping this list of N colors into the determined output grid shape (2x3 or 3x3).
10. Returning the resulting grid. If fewer than N objects are found initially,
    an empty grid may be returned depending on intermediate steps.
