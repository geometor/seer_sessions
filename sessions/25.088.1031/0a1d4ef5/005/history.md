Results for code_00.py:
Train Set Error: error:
No module named 'skimage'
## General Assessment

The primary issue is an `ImportError: No module named 'skimage'`, indicating the use of a disallowed external library. The core logic intended by the code involves:
1.  Identifying connected components (objects) of non-background colors.
2.  Filtering these objects, likely to remove noise or insignificant elements based on size.
3.  Determining the relative spatial arrangement (rows and columns) of the remaining significant objects.
4.  Constructing an output grid containing only the colors of these significant objects, placed according to their determined spatial layout.

The strategy is to reimplement the object finding (`find_objects`) without relying on `skimage`. This typically involves a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find connected components. The filtering and spatial arrangement logic (`filter_objects`, `group_and_sort_objects`) also needs review to ensure it correctly captures the relationship between input objects and their representation in the output grid, but the dependency issue must be resolved first.

## Metrics

Due to the `ImportError`, the code could not be executed against the examples. Therefore, no runtime metrics or specific results for each example are available. Analysis must rely on the intended logic described in the code and the general task structure implied.

The intended process is:
1.  **Object Identification:** Find contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
2.  **Property Extraction:** For each object, determine its color, size (pixel count), and center coordinates.
3.  **Filtering:** Remove objects smaller than a threshold (the code attempted a fixed threshold of 5).
4.  **Spatial Grouping:** Group remaining objects into rows based on vertical proximity of their centers, using a tolerance potentially related to object height.
5.  **Sorting:** Sort objects within each identified row based on their horizontal center coordinates.
6.  **Output Construction:** Create a new grid where each cell corresponds to the color of an object positioned in the derived row/column structure.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels in the input grid. For each object, determine its color, size (number of pixels), and geometric center coordinates.
2.  Filter these objects, keeping only those whose size is greater than or equal to a minimum size threshold (e.g., 5 pixels).
3.  Group the filtered objects into rows. Objects belong to the same row if their vertical center coordinates are close, considering a tolerance (e.g., within a fraction of their respective heights). Sort the identified rows based on their average vertical position (top-to-bottom).
4.  Within each row, sort the objects based on their horizontal center coordinates (left-to-right).
5.  Construct the output grid. The number of rows in the output grid is the number of identified object rows. The number of columns is the maximum number of objects found in any single row.
6.  Populate the output grid cell at `[row_index][col_index]` with the color of the object corresponding to the `col_index`-th object in the `row_index`-th sorted row. If a row has fewer objects than the maximum, leave the remaining cells in that output row as white (0).
