Okay, let's break down the task based on the examples provided.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grids:** The input grids are large (30x30) and contain a mix of colors. The background color is predominantly white (0). Scattered throughout the grid are various colored pixels, some forming noise or small patterns (like red '2' or gray '5' borders/lines).
2.  **Key Objects:** The most prominent features within the input grids are solid, monochromatic rectangular blocks of various colors (excluding white). These blocks appear in different sizes and positions.
3.  **Object Grouping:** In each example, these rectangular blocks seem to be arranged in distinct horizontal "rows". Although not perfectly aligned, blocks within a row share a similar vertical position.
4.  **Output Grids:** The output grids are much smaller (e.g., 3x3, 2x3). Each cell in the output grid corresponds to the color of one of the rectangular blocks identified in the input.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying these key rectangular blocks, determining their relative spatial arrangement (which row they belong to and their order within that row), and then extracting their colors to form the output grid. The order in the output reflects the top-to-bottom arrangement of the rows and the left-to-right arrangement of blocks within each row.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Extract colors of solid rectangular blocks arranged in rows.
definitions:
  background_color: white (0)
  target_object:
    type: rectangle
    properties:
      - solid (monochromatic)
      - color is not background_color
      - maximal (not contained within a larger rectangle of the same color)
input_elements:
  - grid: a 2D array of pixels.
  - target_objects: multiple instances found within the grid.
  - noise: other colored pixels that are not part of target_objects.
relationships:
  - target_objects are spatially arranged within the grid.
  - target_objects can be grouped into "rows" based on similar vertical positions (center y-coordinate).
  - within each row, target_objects have a horizontal order (based on center x-coordinate).
actions:
  - identify: locate all target_objects in the input grid.
  - analyze_position: determine the center coordinates (x, y) for each target_object.
  - group: cluster target_objects into rows based on proximity of their center y-coordinates.
  - sort_rows: order the identified rows based on their average y-coordinate (top to bottom).
  - sort_objects_within_rows: order the target_objects within each row based on their x-coordinate (left to right).
  - extract_color: get the color of each target_object.
  - construct_output: create a new grid where each row corresponds to a sorted group of target_objects, and cell values are the extracted colors in their sorted order.
output_elements:
  - grid: a smaller 2D array where each cell represents the color of a target_object from the input, arranged according to the identified row and column structure.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to identify all maximal, solid, monochromatic rectangular blocks whose color is not white (0). These are the "target objects".
2.  For each target object found, calculate its geometric center (average x and y coordinates).
3.  Group the target objects into sets (rows) where all objects in a set have nearly the same center y-coordinate (allowing for a small tolerance).
4.  Order these groups (rows) based on their average center y-coordinate, from smallest (topmost) to largest (bottommost).
5.  Within each group (row), order the target objects based on their center x-coordinate, from smallest (leftmost) to largest (rightmost).
6.  Determine the dimensions of the output grid: the number of rows is the number of groups found, and the number of columns is the maximum number of objects in any single group.
7.  Construct the output grid. For each ordered group (row), populate the corresponding row in the output grid with the colors of the target objects, following their left-to-right order.
