task_description: Extract colors of solid rectangular blocks arranged in rows.
definitions:
  background_color: white (0)
  target_object:
    type: rectangle
    properties:
      - solid (monochromatic)
      - color is not background_color
      - maximal (not contained within a larger rectangle of the same color)
input_elements:
  - grid: a 2D array of pixels.
  - target_objects: multiple instances found within the grid.
  - noise: other colored pixels that are not part of target_objects.
relationships:
  - target_objects are spatially arranged within the grid.
  - target_objects can be grouped into "rows" based on similar vertical positions (center y-coordinate).
  - within each row, target_objects have a horizontal order (based on center x-coordinate).
actions:
  - identify: locate all target_objects in the input grid.
  - analyze_position: determine the center coordinates (x, y) for each target_object.
  - group: cluster target_objects into rows based on proximity of their center y-coordinates.
  - sort_rows: order the identified rows based on their average y-coordinate (top to bottom).
  - sort_objects_within_rows: order the target_objects within each row based on their x-coordinate (left to right).
  - extract_color: get the color of each target_object.
  - construct_output: create a new grid where each row corresponds to a sorted group of target_objects, and cell values are the extracted colors in their sorted order.
output_elements:
  - grid: a smaller 2D array where each cell represents the color of a target_object from the input, arranged according to the identified row and column structure.
