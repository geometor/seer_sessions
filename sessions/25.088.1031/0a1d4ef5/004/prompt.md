"""
Identifies significant connected components (objects) of non-background colors in the input grid, filtering out smaller objects likely representing noise.
Determines the relative spatial arrangement (rows and columns) of these significant objects based on their center coordinates.
Constructs an output grid containing the colors of these objects, arranged according to their derived row and column positions.
