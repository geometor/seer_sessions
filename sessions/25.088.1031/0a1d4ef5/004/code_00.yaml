perception:
  input_grid:
    description: A 2D grid containing pixels of different colors.
    background_color: white (0) is likely the background.
    elements:
      - type: object
        description: Contiguous blocks of non-background colored pixels.
        properties:
          - color: The integer value (1-9) representing the object's color.
          - pixels: A list of (row, column) coordinates belonging to the object.
          - size: The number of pixels in the object.
          - bounds: The minimum bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
          - center: The geometric center (average row, average column) of the object's pixels.
  output_grid:
    description: A smaller 2D grid representing the arrangement of significant objects from the input.
    content: Contains the colors of the significant input objects.
    structure: The position of a color in the output grid corresponds to the relative spatial position (row and column) of the corresponding object in the input grid.

transformation:
  actions:
    - action: find_objects
      description: Identify all connected components of non-background colors in the input grid.
      inputs: input_grid
      outputs: list_of_objects (with properties: color, pixels, size, bounds, center)
    - action: filter_objects
      description: Select objects based on a size criterion (e.g., remove objects smaller than a threshold).
      inputs: list_of_objects
      outputs: list_of_significant_objects
    - action: determine_layout
      description: Group significant objects into rows based on vertical proximity (e.g., using center y-coordinates and a tolerance) and sort objects within each row based on horizontal position (e.g., using center x-coordinates).
      inputs: list_of_significant_objects
      outputs: list_of_rows (each row is a list of object colors sorted horizontally)
    - action: construct_output
      description: Create the output grid by placing the object colors according to the determined row and column layout.
      inputs: list_of_rows
      outputs: output_grid

parameters:
  - name: background_color
    value: 0
    description: Color to ignore during object finding.
  - name: size_threshold
    value: 5 (based on failed code's attempt)
    description: Minimum size for an object to be considered significant. Needs validation.
  - name: row_grouping_tolerance
    value: Factor based on object height (e.g., 0.75 * height, based on failed code's attempt)
    description: Maximum vertical distance between object centers (or relation to bounds) to be considered in the same row. Needs validation.
