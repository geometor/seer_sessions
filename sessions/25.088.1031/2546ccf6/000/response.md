Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples feature a larger grid divided into smaller, equally sized rectangular "cells" by prominent horizontal and vertical lines of a single color (Magenta in `train_1`, Red in `train_2`). These lines form a 3x3 grid structure in the upper-left portion.
2.  **Grid Lines:** The color of the grid lines differs between examples (Magenta vs. Red) but remains constant within an example and is preserved from input to output.
3.  **Cells:** The regions bounded by the grid lines act as containers for smaller patterns or can be empty (filled with White).
4.  **Patterns:** Within some cells, there are distinct shapes or arrangements of pixels made of a color different from the background (White) and the grid lines. The color of these patterns is significant (Yellow in `train_1`, Green and Blue in `train_2`).
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the *patterns* located within the cells, while the grid lines and background remain static. The specific rearrangement rule depends on the *color* of the pattern.
    *   In `train_1`, the Yellow patterns do not move. Input equals output.
    *   In `train_2`, Green patterns undergo a cyclic shift within the top-left 2x2 block of cells (TL -> ML -> MC -> TM), and Blue patterns undergo a more complex rearrangement involving cells in the bottom row and the row below it.
6.  **Color Dependency:** The action taken (stay, cycle, swap/copy) is determined by the color of the pattern object within a cell. Green (3) triggers a cycle, Blue (1) triggers a specific swap/copy, and other colors (like Yellow=4) result in no change.

**Facts:**

task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - grid_structure: Divided into cells by horizontal and vertical lines of a single color (C_grid).
    - C_grid_color: Varies per example (Magenta=6 in train_1, Red=2 in train_2). Preserved in output.
  objects:
    - type: grid_lines
      properties:
        - color: C_grid
        - orientation: horizontal, vertical
        - function: divides grid into cells
        - persistence: unchanged from input to output
    - type: cell
      properties:
        - location: defined by grid lines (e.g., Top-Left, Middle-Center, Bottom-Middle, Extra-Bottom-Right)
        - content: can contain a pattern or be empty (white)
    - type: pattern
      properties:
        - color: Various (Yellow=4, Green=3, Blue=1 observed), distinct from white and C_grid.
        - location: resides within a specific cell
        - structure: composed of one or more contiguous or non-contiguous pixels of the pattern color.
        - persistence: The pattern itself (shape/pixels) is preserved, but its location may change.
  actions:
    - name: identify_grid_lines
      inputs: input_grid
      outputs: C_grid color, line coordinates
    - name: identify_cells
      inputs: grid_lines coordinates, grid dimensions
      outputs: list of cell boundaries/locations
    - name: extract_pattern
      inputs: input_grid, cell location
      outputs: pattern data, pattern color (or None if empty)
    - name: apply_transformation_rule
      inputs: pattern data, pattern color, cell location
      outputs: target cell location(s) for the pattern in the output grid
      rules:
        - condition: pattern_color == Green (3)
          action: Perform cyclic shift among specific cells (TL -> ML -> MC -> TM).
        - condition: pattern_color == Blue (1)
          action: Perform specific copy/move operations involving BM, BR, ExtraBM, ExtraBR cells.
        - condition: pattern_color == other (e.g., Yellow=4) or cell is empty
          action: Keep pattern in the same cell location (no change).
    - name: construct_output_grid
      inputs: input_grid (for background and grid lines), transformed pattern placements
      outputs: final output grid
  relationships:
    - The transformation rule applied to a pattern depends solely on its color.
    - The locations of cells are relative to the grid lines. Specific relative positions (TL, ML, MC, TM, BM, BR, ExtraBM, ExtraBR) are referenced by the transformation rules.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the primary, non-white color (C_grid) forming the main horizontal and vertical grid lines that divide the grid.
3.  Determine the coordinates of these grid lines to define the boundaries of the cells. Assume these lines typically partition the grid into a 3x3 layout of main cells, plus potentially extra cells below the third row or right of the third column if present (like ExtraBM and ExtraBR).
4.  Create temporary storage for patterns based on their input cell location and color. Specifically identify patterns in the Top-Left (TL), Top-Middle (TM), Middle-Left (ML), Middle-Center (MC), Bottom-Middle (BM), Bottom-Right (BR), and the cells directly below BM (ExtraBM) and BR (ExtraBR).
5.  **Process Green (3) Patterns:**
    a.  Extract the Green pattern (if any) from the input TL cell.
    b.  Extract the Green pattern (if any) from the input ML cell.
    c.  Extract the Green pattern (if any) from the input MC cell.
    d.  Clear the TL, TM, ML, and MC cells in the *output* grid (fill with white).
    e.  Place the extracted TL Green pattern into the ML cell of the output grid.
    f.  Place the extracted ML Green pattern into the MC cell of the output grid.
    g.  Place the extracted MC Green pattern into the TM cell of the output grid.
6.  **Process Blue (1) Patterns:**
    a.  Extract the Blue pattern (if any) from the input BM cell.
    b.  Extract the Blue pattern (if any) from the input BR cell.
    c.  Extract the Blue pattern (if any) from the input ExtraBR cell.
    d.  Clear the BM, BR, ExtraBM, and ExtraBR cells in the *output* grid (fill with white).
    e.  Place the extracted BM Blue pattern back into the BM cell of the output grid.
    f.  Place the extracted BR Blue pattern back into the BR cell of the output grid.
    g.  Place the extracted ExtraBR Blue pattern into the ExtraBM cell of the output grid.
    h.  Place a *copy* of the extracted BM Blue pattern into the ExtraBR cell of the output grid.
7.  **Process Other Patterns/Empty Cells:** For any cell not involved in the Green or Blue transformations (either because it contained a pattern of a different color like Yellow, or it was empty), ensure its content in the output grid remains identical to the input grid. (Step 1 handled this, and steps 5d/6d only cleared cells involved in those specific transformations).
8.  Ensure the C_grid colored lines remain unchanged in the final output grid (handled by initializing output as a copy in step 1 and only modifying cell contents).
9.  Return the final output grid.
