task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - grid_structure: Divided into cells by horizontal and vertical lines of a single color (C_grid).
    - C_grid_color: Varies per example (Magenta=6 in train_1, Red=2 in train_2). Preserved in output.
  objects:
    - type: grid_lines
      properties:
        - color: C_grid
        - orientation: horizontal, vertical
        - function: divides grid into cells
        - persistence: unchanged from input to output
    - type: cell
      properties:
        - location: defined by grid lines (e.g., Top-Left, Middle-Center, Bottom-Middle, Extra-Bottom-Right)
        - content: can contain a pattern or be empty (white)
    - type: pattern
      properties:
        - color: Various (Yellow=4, Green=3, Blue=1 observed), distinct from white and C_grid.
        - location: resides within a specific cell
        - structure: composed of one or more contiguous or non-contiguous pixels of the pattern color.
        - persistence: The pattern itself (shape/pixels) is preserved, but its location may change.
  actions:
    - name: identify_grid_lines
      inputs: input_grid
      outputs: C_grid color, line coordinates
    - name: identify_cells
      inputs: grid_lines coordinates, grid dimensions
      outputs: list of cell boundaries/locations
    - name: extract_pattern
      inputs: input_grid, cell location
      outputs: pattern data, pattern color (or None if empty)
    - name: apply_transformation_rule
      inputs: pattern data, pattern color, cell location
      outputs: target cell location(s) for the pattern in the output grid
      rules:
        - condition: pattern_color == Green (3)
          action: Perform cyclic shift among specific cells (TL -> ML -> MC -> TM).
        - condition: pattern_color == Blue (1)
          action: Perform specific copy/move operations involving BM, BR, ExtraBM, ExtraBR cells.
        - condition: pattern_color == other (e.g., Yellow=4) or cell is empty
          action: Keep pattern in the same cell location (no change).
    - name: construct_output_grid
      inputs: input_grid (for background and grid lines), transformed pattern placements
      outputs: final output grid
  relationships:
    - The transformation rule applied to a pattern depends solely on its color.
    - The locations of cells are relative to the grid lines. Specific relative positions (TL, ML, MC, TM, BM, BR, ExtraBM, ExtraBR) are referenced by the transformation rules.
