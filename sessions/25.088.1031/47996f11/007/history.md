"""
Transforms the input grid by replacing each magenta pixel (6) with the 
color of its nearest non-magenta neighbor. 
Distance is measured using Manhattan distance (|row1 - row2| + |col1 - col2|).
If multiple non-magenta neighbors are equidistant, a tie-breaking rule based 
on the relative direction of the neighbor to the magenta pixel is applied: 
Up is preferred, then Left, then Down, then Right. 
If there's still a tie (e.g., equidistant diagonal neighbors), 
the one with the smallest row index is chosen, and finally the one with the 
smallest column index.
Non-magenta pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.

This implementation uses a multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting
from all non-magenta pixels simultaneously for efficiency.

Train Set Error: Timeout: Code execution exceeded 10 seconds
Okay, let's analyze the situation. The previous code implementing a multi-source BFS timed out on the training set. This indicates a potential issue with the algorithm's efficiency or complexity, especially concerning how candidate source pixels were managed when multiple equidistant sources were found.

## General Assessment and Strategy

1.  **Problem:** The code timed out, likely due to inefficiency in handling multiple equidistant nearest neighbors during the BFS, specifically the storage and merging of candidate lists (`candidates_grid`).
2.  **Hypothesis:** The core logic (finding the nearest non-magenta neighbor using Manhattan distance and applying the specific tie-breaking rule) might be correct, but the implementation needs optimization. The timeout strongly suggests that the overhead of managing lists of candidates for tied distances is too high.
3.  **Strategy:**
    *   Re-analyze the transformation rule by examining the examples (assuming they are available). Pay close attention to how ties are broken.
    *   Gather metrics on grid size, number of source/target pixels, and distances to confirm the scale of the problem.
    *   Refine the natural language program to be precise.
    *   Propose a more efficient algorithm implementation for the coder phase. A potential optimization is to perform tie-breaking *during* the BFS whenever an equally short path is found, storing only the *single best* source found so far for each cell, rather than accumulating lists of candidates.

## Metrics Gathering (Illustrative)

Since I don't have the specific example grids that caused the timeout, I cannot run exact metrics. However, if I had them, I would use `tool_code` like this:

**Example 1 (Input):** `[[0, 1, 0], [6, 6, 6], [0, 2, 0]]`
**Example 1 (Output):** `[[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 2, 0]]`

def analyze_grid(grid_list):
    grid = np.array(grid_list)
    rows, cols = grid.shape

    non_magenta_pixels = np.sum(grid != 6)
    colors, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
    color_counts = dict(zip(colors, counts))

    metrics = {

outcome: OUTCOME_OK

Input Metrics (Example 1):
{'dimensions': '3x3', 'total_pixels': 9, 'magenta_pixels (6)': np.int64(3), 'non_magenta_pixels': np.int64(6), 'color_counts': {np.int64(0): np.int64(4), np.int64(1): np.int64(1), np.int64(2): np.int64(1), np.int64(6): np.int64(3)}}

Output Metrics (Example 1):
{'dimensions': '3x3', 'total_pixels': 9, 'magenta_pixels (6)': np.int64(0), 'non_magenta_pixels': np.int64(9), 'color_counts': {np.int64(0): np.int64(4), np.int64(1): np.int64(3), np.int64(2): np.int64(2)}}

Magenta Locations (Example 1):
[[1 0]
 [1 1]
 [1 2]]

```
**Interpretation of Metrics (Hypothetical based on Timeout):**
If the metrics across *all* examples revealed large grids, a high density of magenta pixels, or complex configurations leading to many distance ties, it would support the hypothesis that the candidate management in the previous code was the bottleneck.

## Documented Facts (YAML)


```yaml
Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9) corresponding to specific colors (white, blue, red, etc.)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates in a grid
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: height (rows) x width (columns)
      - content: 2D array of Pixels

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically.
  - Distance: Manhattan distance between pixels (|row1 - row2| + |col1 - col2|).

Initial State (Input Grid):
  - Contains pixels of various colors.
  - Some pixels are magenta (color 6).
  - Other pixels are non-magenta (colors 0-5, 7-9).

Actions/Transformations:
  - Identify: Locate all magenta pixels (targets).
  - Identify: Locate all non-magenta pixels (sources).
  - For each magenta pixel:
      - Find: Identify the set of non-magenta pixels that are closest to it based on Manhattan distance.
      - Select: If there is only one closest non-magenta pixel, choose its color.
      - Select (Tie-breaking): If multiple non-magenta pixels are equidistant:
          - Prioritize based on the relative direction of the source pixel to the magenta pixel: Up > Left > Down > Right.
          - If still tied (e.g., equidistant diagonal neighbors, or sources in non-primary directions relative to the target), prioritize the source pixel with the smallest row index.
          - If still tied, prioritize the source pixel with the smallest column index.
      - Replace: Change the color of the magenta pixel to the selected color.
  - Keep: Non-magenta pixels remain unchanged.

Final State (Output Grid):
  - Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Original non-magenta pixels retain their colors and positions.
  - Original magenta pixels are replaced with the color determined by the nearest neighbor rule and tie-breaking.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all non-magenta pixels in the input grid. These are the "source" pixels.
3.  Identify all magenta pixels (color 6) in the input grid. These are the "target" pixels that need modification. If there are no target pixels, return the original grid. If there are no source pixels, return the original grid.
4.  For each target pixel `T` at position `(tr, tc)`:
    a.  Calculate the Manhattan distance from `T` to every source pixel `S` at `(sr, sc)`.
    b.  Find the minimum distance found (`min_dist`).
    c.  Create a list of candidate source pixels `C` that are exactly `min_dist` away from `T`.
    d.  If `C` contains only one source pixel `S_winner`, the replacement color for `T` is the color of `S_winner`.
    e.  If `C` contains multiple source pixels (a tie):
        i.  Define a priority order for relative directions from `T` to a candidate `S`: Up (dr=-1, dc=0) is highest (priority 0), then Left (dr=0, dc=-1, priority 1), then Down (dr=1, dc=0, priority 2), then Right (dr=0, dc=1, priority 3). All other relative positions (e.g., diagonals) have lower priority (priority 4).
        ii. For each candidate `S` in `C` at `(sr, sc)`, determine its priority based on its direction relative to `T`.
        iii. Select the candidate(s) with the highest priority (lowest priority number).
        iv. If there is still a tie (multiple candidates share the highest priority), select the candidate among them with the smallest row index (`sr`).
        v.  If there is *still* a tie (multiple candidates share the highest priority and the smallest row index), select the candidate among them with the smallest column index (`sc`).
        vi. The replacement color for `T` is the color of the single candidate `S_winner` selected through this tie-breaking process.
    f.  Update the color of the pixel at `(tr, tc)` in the output grid with the determined replacement color.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
