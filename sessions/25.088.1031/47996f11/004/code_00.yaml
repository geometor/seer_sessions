Objects:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - height: Integer (1-30)
      - width: Integer (1-30)
      - pixels: 2D array of colors (integers 0-9)
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
      - is_magenta: Boolean (True if color == 6)
  - type: SourcePixel
    description: A non-magenta pixel (color != 6) acting as a source for coloring magenta pixels.
  - type: TargetPixel
    description: A magenta pixel (color == 6) that needs its color replaced.

Relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    between: [Pixel, Pixel]
    properties:
      - type: Cardinal (Up, Down, Left, Right)
      - type: Diagonal
  - type: Distance
    between: [Pixel, Pixel]
    properties:
      - type: Manhattan (|r1-r2| + |c1-c2|)

Actions:
  - action: Identify
    actor: System
    target: Pixels
    constraints:
      - property: is_magenta
        value: True
    output: Set of TargetPixels
  - action: Identify
    actor: System
    target: Pixels
    constraints:
      - property: is_magenta
        value: False
    output: Set of SourcePixels
  - action: FindNearestSource
    actor: System
    target: TargetPixel
    using:
      - metric: Manhattan Distance
      - sources: Set of SourcePixels
    tie_breaking: # Based on code interpretation
      - rule: Prefer minimum distance
      - rule: Prefer Up direction (-1, 0) relative to TargetPixel
      - rule: Prefer Left direction (0, -1) relative to TargetPixel
      - rule: Prefer Down direction (+1, 0) relative to TargetPixel
      - rule: Prefer Right direction (0, +1) relative to TargetPixel
      - rule: Prefer minimum row index of SourcePixel
      - rule: Prefer minimum column index of SourcePixel
    output: The selected SourcePixel
  - action: ReplaceColor
    actor: System
    target: TargetPixel
    using:
      - source: Output of FindNearestSource action for that TargetPixel
    effect: Changes the TargetPixel's color to the SourcePixel's color.
  - action: PreserveColor
    actor: System
    target: SourcePixel
    effect: The pixel's color remains unchanged in the output grid.

TransformationGoal:
  - description: Create an output grid where every pixel that was magenta (6) in the input grid is replaced by the color of the nearest non-magenta pixel according to Manhattan distance, using the specified tie-breaking rules. All non-magenta pixels retain their original color.
  - performance_constraint: Must execute within the time limit (e.g., 10 seconds).

PotentialOptimization:
  - strategy: Multi-source BFS
    description: Initiate BFS simultaneously from all SourcePixels. Expand outwards, recording distance and source color. When expanding into an unvisited cell or a cell reached at a greater distance, update it. If reached at the same distance, apply tie-breaking rules to decide if the new source takes precedence. TargetPixels inherit the color of the source recorded for their position after the BFS completes.
