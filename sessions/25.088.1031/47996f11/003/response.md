"""
Transforms the input grid by replacing each magenta pixel (6) with the 
color of its nearest non-magenta neighbor. 
Distance is measured using Manhattan distance (|row1 - row2| + |col1 - col2|).
If multiple non-magenta neighbors are equidistant, a tie-breaking rule based 
on direction relative to the magenta pixel is applied: Up is preferred, 
then Left, then Down, then Right. 
If there's still a tie (e.g., only equidistant diagonal neighbors), 
the one with the smallest row index is chosen, and finally the one with the 
smallest column index.
Non-magenta pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.

This implementation uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) for efficient neighbor finding.

def get_sort_key(coord, center_r, center_c):

    Generates a sort key for a candidate coordinate based on its position

    The key prioritizes directions: Up (0), Left (1), Down (2), Right (3).
    Other relative positions (like diagonals) get a lower priority (4).
    Secondary sorting uses row index, and tertiary sorting uses column index.
