"""
Transforms the input grid by replacing each magenta pixel (6) with the 
color of its nearest non-magenta neighbor. 
Distance is measured using Manhattan distance (|row1 - row2| + |col1 - col2|).
If multiple non-magenta neighbors are equidistant, a tie-breaking rule based 
on the relative direction of the neighbor to the magenta pixel is applied: 
Up is preferred, then Left, then Down, then Right. 
If there's still a tie (e.g., equidistant diagonal neighbors), 
the one with the smallest row index is chosen, and finally the one with the 
smallest column index.
Non-magenta pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.

This implementation uses a multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting
from all non-magenta pixels simultaneously for efficiency.

def get_sort_key(candidate_coord, center_r, center_c):
    """
    Generates a sort key for a candidate source coordinate based on its position 
    relative to a center point (the target magenta pixel) for tie-breaking.
    
    The key prioritizes directions relative to the center: 
    Up (0), Left (1), Down (2), Right (3).
    Other relative positions (like diagonals) get a lower priority (4).
    Secondary sorting uses the candidate's row index, and tertiary sorting uses 
    the candidate's column index.
