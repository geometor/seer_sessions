            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. The previous code implementing a multi-source BFS timed out on the training set. This indicates a potential issue with the algorithm's efficiency or complexity, especially concerning how candidate source pixels were managed when multiple equidistant sources were found.\n\n## General Assessment and Strategy\n\n1.  **Problem:** The code timed out, likely due to inefficiency in handling multiple equidistant nearest neighbors during the BFS, specifically the storage and merging of candidate lists (`candidates_grid`).\n2.  **Hypothesis:** The core logic (finding the nearest non-magenta neighbor using Manhattan distance and applying the specific tie-breaking rule) might be correct, but the implementation needs optimization. The timeout strongly suggests that the overhead of managing lists of candidates for tied distances is too high.\n3.  **Strategy:**\n    *   Re-analyze the transformation rule by examining the examples (assuming they are available). Pay close attention to how ties are broken.\n    *   Gather metrics on grid size, number of source/target pixels, and distances to confirm the scale of the problem.\n    *   Refine the natural language program to be precise.\n    *   Propose a more efficient algorithm implementation for the coder phase. A potential optimization is to perform tie-breaking *during* the BFS whenever an equally short path is found, storing only the *single best* source found so far for each cell, rather than accumulating lists of candidates.\n\n## Metrics Gathering (Illustrative)\n\nSince I don't have the specific example grids that caused the timeout, I cannot run exact metrics. However, if I had them, I would use `tool_code` like this:\n\n**Example 1 (Input):** `[[0, 1, 0], [6, 6, 6], [0, 2, 0]]`\n**Example 1 (Output):** `[[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 2, 0]]`\n\n"
