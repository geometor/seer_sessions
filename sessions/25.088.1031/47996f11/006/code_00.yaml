Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9) corresponding to specific colors (white, blue, red, etc.)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates in a grid
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: height (rows) x width (columns)
      - content: 2D array of Pixels

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically.
  - Distance: Manhattan distance between pixels (|row1 - row2| + |col1 - col2|).

Initial State (Input Grid):
  - Contains pixels of various colors.
  - Some pixels are magenta (color 6).
  - Other pixels are non-magenta (colors 0-5, 7-9).

Actions/Transformations:
  - Identify: Locate all magenta pixels (targets).
  - Identify: Locate all non-magenta pixels (sources).
  - For each magenta pixel:
      - Find: Identify the set of non-magenta pixels that are closest to it based on Manhattan distance.
      - Select: If there is only one closest non-magenta pixel, choose its color.
      - Select (Tie-breaking): If multiple non-magenta pixels are equidistant:
          - Prioritize based on the relative direction of the source pixel to the magenta pixel: Up > Left > Down > Right.
          - If still tied (e.g., equidistant diagonal neighbors, or sources in non-primary directions relative to the target), prioritize the source pixel with the smallest row index.
          - If still tied, prioritize the source pixel with the smallest column index.
      - Replace: Change the color of the magenta pixel to the selected color.
  - Keep: Non-magenta pixels remain unchanged.

Final State (Output Grid):
  - Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Original non-magenta pixels retain their colors and positions.
  - Original magenta pixels are replaced with the color determined by the nearest neighbor rule and tie-breaking.
