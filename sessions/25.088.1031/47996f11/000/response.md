*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids have the same dimensions (30x30 in all examples).
    *   The transformation focuses specifically on pixels with the color magenta (`6`). All other pixels retain their original colors and positions in the output grid.
    *   Regions of magenta pixels in the input are replaced by other colors in the output.
    *   The replacement colors appear to be sourced from the non-magenta pixels that are spatially closest to the magenta pixels being replaced.
    *   Observing the different examples, the pattern of replacement seems consistent: each magenta pixel adopts the color of its nearest non-magenta neighbor in the input grid. If there are multiple non-magenta neighbors at the same minimum distance, a tie-breaking rule seems to apply (likely based on direction: Up, then Left, then Down, then Right).

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid.
    3.  Check if the color of the input cell `input[r, c]` is magenta (`6`).
    4.  If the cell is magenta:
        a.  Find the set of all non-magenta pixels in the input grid.
        b.  Calculate the Manhattan distance from the current magenta cell `(r, c)` to every non-magenta cell `(nr, nc)`. The distance is `|r - nr| + |c - nc|`.
        c.  Determine the minimum distance found.
        d.  Identify all non-magenta cells that are at this minimum distance.
        e.  From these equidistant nearest non-magenta cells, select one based on a directional priority:
            i.  Prefer the cell directly above (`nr < r, nc == c`).
            ii. If none above, prefer the cell directly to the left (`nr == r, nc < c`).
            iii. If none above or left, prefer the cell directly below (`nr > r, nc == c`).
            iv. If none above, left, or below, prefer the cell directly to the right (`nr == r, nc > c`).
            v.  If cardinal directions tie or don't exist at the minimum distance, check relative positions: prioritize minimum `nr` first, then minimum `nc` among those with minimum `nr`. (More robust tie-break: check relative position in order: `(r-d, c)`, `(r, c-d)`, `(r+d, c)`, `(r, c+d)`, then check intermediate positions for that distance `d`). A simpler, likely intended tie-break: evaluate neighbors in the order Up, Left, Down, Right. The first one encountered at the minimum distance determines the color.
        f.  Update the output grid cell `output[r, c]` with the color of the selected nearest non-magenta neighbor.
    5.  If the input cell `input[r, c]` is not magenta, its color in the output grid `output[r, c]` remains unchanged from the input.
    6.  After iterating through all cells, return the final output grid.
