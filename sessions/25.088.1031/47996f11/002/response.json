            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code attempts to solve the task by replacing each magenta pixel (6) with the color of its nearest non-magenta neighbor, using Manhattan distance and a specific tie-breaking rule (Up, Left, Down, Right). The code failed with a `Timeout` error on the training set.\n\nThis timeout strongly suggests that the current implementation of the nearest neighbor search (`find_closest_non_magenta`) is computationally too expensive. The function iterates through the entire grid for *every single* magenta pixel to find the minimum distance and then iterates *again* to collect candidates at that distance. This leads to a time complexity roughly proportional to `(rows * cols) * num_magenta_pixels`, which is inefficient for larger grids or grids with many magenta pixels.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Algorithmic Optimization**: Replace the current brute-force search with a more efficient algorithm. Breadth-First Search (BFS) is well-suited for finding the nearest element(s) in a grid. A BFS can be initiated from each magenta pixel, expanding outwards layer by layer (increasing Manhattan distance). The first non-magenta pixel encountered is guaranteed to be one of the nearest.\n2.  **Incorporate Tie-breaking into BFS**: The BFS expansion order can incorporate the tie-breaking rule. When exploring neighbors at the same distance level, check them in the preferred order: Up, Left, Down, Right relative to the starting magenta pixel. The first non-magenta pixel found during this prioritized exploration will be the correct one according to the rule.\n3.  **Re-verify Logic**: Although the timeout is the immediate issue, ensure the interpretation of \"nearest\" (Manhattan distance) and the tie-breaking rule precisely match the pattern observed in *all* examples once the timeout is resolved.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nWithout the specific input grids that caused the timeout, I cannot compute exact metrics. However, based on the timeout error and the algorithm's nature, the following metrics are crucial for understanding the performance bottleneck:\n\n"
