"""
Transforms the input grid by replacing each magenta pixel (6) with the 
color of its nearest non-magenta neighbor. 
Distance is measured using Manhattan distance (|row1 - row2| + |col1 - col2|).
If multiple non-magenta neighbors are equidistant, a tie-breaking rule based 
on direction relative to the magenta pixel is applied: Up is preferred, 
then Left, then Down, then Right. 
If there's still a tie (e.g., only equidistant diagonal neighbors), 
the one with the smallest row index is chosen, and finally the one with the 
smallest column index.
Non-magenta pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.

This implementation uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) for efficient neighbor finding.

Train Set Error: Timeout: Code execution exceeded 10 seconds
Okay, let's analyze the situation and refine the approach.

## General Assessment

The provided Python code attempts to solve the task by implementing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from each magenta pixel (color 6) to find the nearest non-magenta pixel using Manhattan distance. It includes a specific tie-breaking rule (Up > Left > Down > Right > Row > Col) for equidistant neighbors.

The "Train Set Error: Timeout" indicates that this approach, while potentially correct for some cases, is too computationally expensive for at least one of the training examples within the allowed time limit (10 seconds). This typically happens with large grids, a high density of pixels needing processing (magenta pixels), or situations where the search space for the nearest neighbor is very large (e.g., non-magenta pixels are far away).

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Verify the Core Logic:** First, ensure the fundamental understanding of the task (replacing magenta with the nearest non-magenta color, specific tie-breaking) is correct across *all* training examples. If the examples were available, we would compare the logic against each pair.
2.  **Identify Performance Bottleneck:** The current approach runs an independent BFS for *every* magenta pixel. This is the likely bottleneck.
3.  **Explore Optimization:** Consider alternative algorithms. A multi-source BFS starting simultaneously from *all* non-magenta pixels could be much more efficient. In this approach, we'd expand outwards from non-magenta sources, marking each visited cell with the source color and distance. Magenta cells would adopt the color of the first source to reach them, incorporating the tie-breaking rule during the expansion or selection process.
4.  **Re-evaluate Tie-Breaking:** Double-check if the complex tie-breaking rule (Up > Left > Down > Right > Row > Col) is consistently applied across all examples or if a simpler rule suffices. The complexity of the sort key calculation might also contribute slightly to the overhead.

## Metrics

Without the specific example data, I cannot provide exact metrics. However, if the examples were available, I would gather the following for each input/output pair:

    non_magenta_count = grid.size - magenta_count
    # Add any specific observations about this example if available

    non_magenta_count = grid.size - magenta_count
    notes = "Test input"
    print(f"| Test {i+1}  | {rows} x {cols} | {magenta_count} | {non_magenta_count} | {notes} |")
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
| Example | Grid Dim (H x W) | # Magenta Pixels | # Non-Magenta Pixels | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Train 1 | 3 x 3 | 5 | 4 | Output 0 seems to replace magenta with [0] |
| Train 2 | 3 x 3 | 1 | 8 | Output 1 seems to replace magenta with [1] |
| Train 3 | 3 x 3 | 8 | 1 | Output 2 seems to replace magenta with [2] |
| Test 1  | 3 x 3 | 5 | 4 | Test input |

```
*(Note: The metrics above use dummy data. Actual analysis requires the real task examples.)*

These metrics help identify potentially problematic cases:
*   Large dimensions combined with many magenta pixels.
*   Cases where non-magenta pixels are sparse or far from magenta ones.

    description: Initiate BFS simultaneously from all SourcePixels. Expand outwards, recording distance and source color. When expanding into an unvisited cell or a cell reached at a greater distance, update it. If reached at the same distance, apply tie-breaking rules to decide if the new source takes precedence. TargetPixels inherit the color of the source recorded for their position after the BFS completes.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all 'source' pixels (pixels with color not equal to 6) and all 'target' pixels (pixels with color equal to 6) in the input grid.
3.  If there are no target pixels, return the original grid.
4.  If there are no source pixels, return the original grid (target pixels cannot be changed).
5.  *Optimized Approach (Multi-Source BFS):*
    a.  Create a distance grid initialized to infinity for all cells and a source-color grid initialized to a placeholder (e.g., -1).
    b.  Initialize a queue with all source pixels. For each source pixel `(r, c)` with color `clr`, set its distance to 0 in the distance grid and its color `clr` in the source-color grid. Add `(r, c, dist=0, source_color=clr, source_pos=(r,c))` to the queue.
    c.  While the queue is not empty:
        i.  Dequeue the element with the smallest distance. If distances are equal, use the tie-breaking source position preference (min row, then min col) to select which element to process first. Let this be `(r, c, dist, src_clr, src_pos)`.
        ii. Explore the cardinal neighbors `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)`.
        iii. For each neighbor `(nr, nc)`:
            *   Calculate the new distance `new_dist = dist + 1`.
            *   Check the current distance `current_dist` recorded for `(nr, nc)`.
            *   If `new_dist < current_dist`: Update the distance grid at `(nr, nc)` to `new_dist`, update the source-color grid at `(nr, nc)` to `src_clr`, and enqueue `(nr, nc, new_dist, src_clr, src_pos)`.
            *   If `new_dist == current_dist`: Compare the current source `current_src_pos` associated with `(nr, nc)` against the new source `src_pos` using the tie-breaking rule relative to the neighbor `(nr, nc)` itself (Up > Left > Down > Right > Source Row > Source Col). If the new source `src_pos` is preferred according to the tie-breaking rule applied *at the neighbor* `(nr, nc)`, update the source-color grid at `(nr, nc)` to `src_clr` and potentially update queue priority if using a priority queue sensitive to source preference. *(Self-correction: The tie-breaking needs to be applied carefully. It might be simpler to store all winning sources at min distance and resolve ties *after* the BFS, or integrate the tie-breaking into the comparison logic directly during BFS.)*
    d.  *Revised BFS Step (Simpler Tie-Breaking Integration)*:
        Instead of complex tie-breaking during queue processing, let's stick closer to the original code's *intent* but optimize the search structure. We'll use a multi-source BFS to find distances and *candidate* sources, then apply the specific tie-breaking rule *relative to the target magenta pixel* once the minimum distance is known.

6.  *Refined Optimized Approach (Multi-Source BFS for distance + Post-Processing):*
    a.  Create a distance grid initialized to infinity and a list grid (or similar structure) to store `(source_color, source_pos)` pairs for each cell.
    b.  Initialize a queue with all source pixels `(r, c)` having color `clr`. Set their distance to 0, store `(clr, (r,c))` in the list grid for `(r,c)`, and add `(r, c, 0)` to the queue.
    c.  Run a standard multi-source BFS:
        i.  Dequeue `(r, c, dist)`.
        ii. For each cardinal neighbor `(nr, nc)`:
            *   If `dist + 1 < distance[nr, nc]`: Update `distance[nr, nc] = dist + 1`, clear the list at `(nr, nc)`, add `(grid[r,c], (r,c))` if `(r,c)` was the original source *or* the source associated with `(r,c)` from the list grid, and enqueue `(nr, nc, dist + 1)`.
            *   If `dist + 1 == distance[nr, nc]`: Add `(grid[r,c], (r,c))` (or associated source) to the list at `(nr, nc)`.
    d.  Iterate through all original target (magenta) pixel locations `(tr, tc)`.
    e.  If `distance[tr, tc]` is infinity, leave the pixel magenta (or handle as per examples if this case occurs).
    f.  Otherwise, retrieve the list of candidate sources `[(src_clr1, src_pos1), (src_clr2, src_pos2), ...]` from the list grid at `(tr, tc)`. These are all sources at the minimum Manhattan distance.
    g.  Apply the tie-breaking rule to this list: Sort the candidates based on the relative direction from the source position `src_pos` to the target position `(tr, tc)` (Up > Left > Down > Right), then by source row index, then by source column index.
    h.  Select the color `src_clr` from the winning candidate after sorting.
    i.  Update the output grid at `(tr, tc)` with the selected `src_clr`.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
