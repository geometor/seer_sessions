Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (0-9).
  - Pixels:
      - White (0): Background.
      - Green (3): Foreground color, forming objects.
  - Objects:
      - Definition: Connected components of Green pixels (8-way connectivity).
      - Count: Variable (1 in train_2, 3 in train_1, 2 in train_3).
      - Shape: Rectangular or composed of rectangles in examples.
      - Position: Scattered across the grid.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Pixels:
      - White (0): Background.
      - Green (3): Includes original input Green pixels plus newly added Green pixels.
  - Added_Pixels:
      - Location (train_1, train_3): Primarily located on straight line paths connecting pairs of pixels from different input objects.
      - Location (train_2): Appear as potentially shifted/fragmented copies of the original object, located far from the original.

Relationships:
  - Transformation_Rule: Input green pixels determine the location of output green pixels.
  - Line_Drawing: The core operation seems to be drawing straight lines (potentially using Bresenham's algorithm) between pairs of input green pixels.
  - Object_Interaction (Hypothesized for train_1, train_3): Lines are drawn between pairs of pixels (p1, p2) where p1 and p2 belong to different source objects.
  - Single_Object_Behavior (Observed in train_2): Transformation results in new shapes not explained by the inter-object line drawing hypothesis.

Potential_Contradiction:
  - The rule observed for multi-object inputs (connecting lines) does not predict the output for the single-object input. The exact rule unifying all examples is uncertain based on the provided data.
