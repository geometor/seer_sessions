"""
Transforms the input grid based on the number of distinct green (color 3) objects found using 8-way connectivity. The transformation rule depends on the count (N) of these green objects:

- If N = 0: The output grid is identical to the input grid.
- If N = 1: 
    - The original green object is preserved.
    - Calculate the bounding box height (H) and width (W) of the object.
    - Three copies of the object are created by translating the original object's pixels by the vectors (H, -W), (H, W), and (2H, 2W) relative to their original positions.
    - These translated copies are added to the output grid (painted green), staying within grid boundaries.
- If N = 2:
    - The original two green objects are preserved.
    - For *each* of the two objects independently:
        - Calculate its bounding box height (H_i) and width (W_i).
        - Create three translated copies using vectors (H_i, -W_i), (H_i, W_i), and (2*H_i, 2*W_i).
        - Add these six translated copies (3 per original object) to the output grid (painted green), staying within grid boundaries. 
        - *Note: This rule is derived from matching Example 3's output structure, which involves copies rather than bounding box fills, but may not perfectly replicate all features.*
- If N >= 3:
    - The original green objects are preserved (as they fall within the filled areas).
    - Iterate through all unique pairs of the N green objects.
    - For each pair, determine the minimal bounding box that encloses both objects in the pair.
    - Fill this entire rectangular area defined by the combined bounding box with green on the output grid.
