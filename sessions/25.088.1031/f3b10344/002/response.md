Okay, let's analyze the discrepancies and refine the understanding of the transformation.

**General Assessment**

The provided code correctly identifies non-white objects and attempts to fill rectangular gaps between pairs of same-colored objects that are horizontally or vertically aligned. The core logic correctly identifies potential pairs and checks if the rectangular region between their bounding boxes (within the overlapping row/column span) is entirely white.

However, the results show consistent errors in the *exact area* being filled with azure (8). The code fills the entire calculated gap rectangle based on bounding box overlaps, while the expected outputs show fills that are slightly smaller, typically excluding one boundary row for horizontal fills and the boundary columns for vertical fills.

The strategy is to:
1.  Precisely define the row/column ranges for the *overlapping span* between two objects.
2.  Precisely define the row/column ranges for the *gap* between the two objects.
3.  Verify the condition that the rectangular area defined by the gap rows and overlapping columns (for vertical alignment) or gap columns and overlapping rows (for horizontal alignment) must be entirely white (0).
4.  Refine the rule for calculating the *exact area* to be filled with azure (8), based on the observations from the examples, likely involving adjusting the boundaries of the fill area relative to the overlap and gap ranges.
