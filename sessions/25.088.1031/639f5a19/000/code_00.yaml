elements:
  - element: grid
    role: background
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - unchanged between input and output
  - element: rectangle
    role: object
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - solid fill
      - variable dimensions (height H, width W)
      - variable position
      - exists only in input
      - always aligned with grid axes
  - element: pattern
    role: object_replacement
    colors: [magenta (6), blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4)]
    properties:
      - occupies the exact same area as a corresponding input azure rectangle
      - internal structure depends on position within the block area
      - exists only in output
relationships:
  - relationship: replacement
    subject: azure rectangle (input)
    object: multi-color pattern (output)
    details: Each azure rectangle is replaced by a pattern.
actions:
  - action: identify_blocks
    input: input grid
    output: list of azure rectangles (location, dimensions)
  - action: apply_pattern
    input: azure rectangle (location, dimensions HxW)
    output: patterned block (same location and dimensions)
    details:
      - calculate center point: mid_row = H // 2, mid_col = W // 2 (relative indices)
      - calculate central yellow region boundaries (relative indices):
          r_start_yellow = 2
          r_end_yellow = H - 3
          c_start_yellow = 2
          c_end_yellow = W - 3
      - for each pixel (r, c) within the block's relative coordinates:
          - if (r_start_yellow <= r <= r_end_yellow) and (c_start_yellow <= c <= c_end_yellow):
              color = yellow (4)
          - else (pixel is in the border region):
              - if r < mid_row and c < mid_col: color = magenta (6)
              - if r < mid_row and c >= mid_col: color = blue (1)
              - if r >= mid_row and c < mid_col: color = red (2)
              - if r >= mid_row and c >= mid_col: color = green (3)
  - action: reconstruct_output
    input: original grid, list of patterned blocks
    output: output grid
    details: Copy the input grid, then overwrite the areas corresponding to the original azure blocks with their respective generated patterns.
