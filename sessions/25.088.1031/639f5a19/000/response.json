            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain one or more solid rectangular blocks of azure (8) pixels against a white (0) background. The blocks can have different dimensions and positions.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the white background. The areas previously occupied by the azure blocks are now filled with patterns composed of multiple colors: magenta (6), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4). The shape and position of the original azure blocks are preserved in the output patterns.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation applies a specific coloring pattern rule to each azure block independently.\n4.  **Pattern Details:** Within each transformed block:\n    *   There's a central rectangular region colored yellow (4).\n    *   The border region around the yellow center is divided into four quadrants.\n    *   The top-left border quadrant is magenta (6).\n    *   The top-right border quadrant is blue (1).\n    *   The bottom-left border quadrant is red (2).\n    *   The bottom-right border quadrant is green (3).\n5.  **Pattern Geometry:**\n    *   The division into quadrants seems based on the horizontal and vertical center lines of the block.\n    *   The central yellow rectangle appears to be defined by excluding a border of fixed thickness (seems like 2 pixels) from all four sides of the original block. If the block is too small (less than 5x5), the yellow region might not exist.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Find all distinct, contiguous rectangular blocks composed solely of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Record the top-left corner coordinates (row `R`, column `C`) and dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) of each block.\n3.  For each identified azure block:\n    a.  Determine the relative row and column midpoints for division: `mid_row = H // 2`, `mid_col = W // 2`.\n    b.

Calculate the relative coordinates within the block: `r_rel = r_abs - R`, `c_rel = c_abs - C`.\n    e.  Check if the relative coordinates `(r_rel, c_rel)` fall within the central yellow region: `r_start_yellow <= r_rel <= r_end_yellow` AND `c_start_yellow <= c_rel <= c_end_yellow`.\n        i.
