"""
Identify enclosed regions formed by blue (1) shapes against a white (0) background.
Color the interior of these enclosed regions green (3).
Color the white (0) pixels immediately adjacent (8-way) to the outside of the enclosing blue shapes red (2).
Shapes that do not form a complete enclosure, or pixels not involved in such enclosures, remain unchanged.

Workflow:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Create a 'visited' grid to track processed white pixels during region finding.
3. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
4. If a pixel is white (0) and hasn't been visited:
    a. Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from this pixel to find the connected white region.
    b. During the BFS, keep track of all pixels in the region and whether the region touches the grid boundary. Also mark visited pixels.
    c. If the BFS completes and the region did *not* touch the boundary (it's enclosed):
        i. Find all blue (1) pixels adjacent (8-way) to any pixel in the enclosed white region. These are the 'border blue pixels'.
        ii. Change the color of all pixels within the enclosed white region to green (3) in the output grid.
        iii. Iterate through the 'border blue pixels'. For each border blue pixel, find its adjacent (8-way) neighbors.
        iv. If a neighbor is within grid bounds and its color in the *output* grid is still white (0) (meaning it wasn't part of the enclosed region just colored green), change its color to red (2) in the output grid.
5. Return the modified output grid.
