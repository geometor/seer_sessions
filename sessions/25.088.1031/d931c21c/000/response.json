The primary colors involved are white (0), blue (1), red (2), and green (3).\n2.  **Objects:** The salient objects in the input grids are shapes formed by contiguous blue (1) pixels against a white (0) background. These shapes vary in form (rectangles, L-shapes, more complex structures) and can be hollow or solid.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying specific blue shapes and modifying the pixels inside and immediately outside them.\n    *   Shapes that fully enclose a region of white (0) pixels are targeted.\n    *   The enclosed white pixels are changed to green (3).\n    *   The white pixels immediately adjacent (8-way connectivity) to the *outside* of the enclosing blue shape are changed to red (2).\n4.  **Conditionality:** The transformation is conditional. It only applies to blue shapes that form a complete enclosure. Blue shapes that do not enclose a white area (like open shapes or solid shapes) remain unchanged, along with their surrounding pixels.\n5.  **Spatial Relationships:** Adjacency (both side-by-side and diagonal) is crucial for defining the enclosed area (\"inside\") and the immediate exterior boundary (\"outside\"). Topology (identifying enclosed vs. open regions) is the key concept.\n6.  **Consistency:** The blue shapes themselves (the pixels with value 1) are never modified; only the surrounding or enclosed white pixels are changed.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
