*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input and output grids have the same dimensions (30x30 in all training examples).
    *   The primary transformation involves identifying specific rectangular areas in the input grid that are filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
    *   These white rectangular blocks are replaced in the output grid with patterns copied from other rectangular blocks within the input grid.
    *   The source block used for replacement has the exact same dimensions (height and width) as the white block it replaces.
    *   Crucially, the source block is always located within the same vertical range of columns as the white block it corresponds to.
    *   In each vertical strip defined by the columns of a white block, there appears to be exactly one other block of the same dimensions. This suggests a pairing mechanism: find pairs of blocks with identical dimensions within the same column range, where one block is white and the other is not. The white block is then replaced by the non-white paired block.

*   **Facts:**

    task_elements:
      - element: grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: Constant (30x30 in examples)
          - pixels: Integers 0-9 representing colors
      - element: rectangular_block
        properties:
          - location: [row_start, row_end, col_start, col_end]
          - dimensions: height (H), width (W)
          - content: Can be uniform (e.g., all white) or patterned
      - element: white_block
        description: A rectangular_block where all pixels have the value 0 (white).
        relationship: Paired with a non-white block.
      - element: non_white_block
        description: A rectangular_block containing at least one non-white pixel.
        relationship: Paired with a white block.
      - relationship: pairing
        description: >
          Two rectangular_blocks form a pair if they share the exact same
          dimensions (H, W) and occupy the same range of columns (col_start to col_end),
          and they are the only two blocks with these specific dimensions within that column range.
        condition: One block must be a white_block, the other a non_white_block.
      - action: replacement
        description: The content of the white_block in a pair is replaced by the content of the non_white_block from the same pair.
        target: white_block
        source: non_white_block in the same pair
        output: Modified grid where white_blocks have been replaced.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Scan the input grid to identify all unique rectangular block dimensions (Height H, Width W) present.
    3.  For each unique dimension (H, W):
        a.  Scan the input grid column by column to identify all possible starting columns C for a block of width W.
        b.  For each potential column range `[C : C+W]`:
