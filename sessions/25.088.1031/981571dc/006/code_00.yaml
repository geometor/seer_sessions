Input Grid:
  - Contains a background color (white, 0).
  - Contains one or more distinct foreground objects.
Objects:
  - Defined as contiguous regions of the same non-white color.
  - Can have various shapes and colors.
  - Identified using BFS in the previous attempt.
Transformation (Previous Attempt - Led to Timeout):
  - Find all non-white objects.
  - For each object:
    - Calculate a minimum required downward shift (`delta_r > 0`).
    - The condition for a valid shift was: all pixels of the shifted object must land on cells that were white (0) in the *original* input grid, or land outside the original grid's bottom boundary.
    - This calculation involved a `while True` loop incrementing `delta_r` and checking all object pixels against the *original* grid state.
  - Resize the output grid vertically if needed to accommodate the original content and the maximum shifted position.
  - Copy the original objects to their calculated shifted positions in the output grid.
  - Keep the original objects in their initial positions in the output grid.
Failure Mode:
  - Timeout: The execution exceeded the time limit on the training set.
Inferred Cause:
  - The iterative search (`while True`) for the correct `delta_r` based on the "land on original white" condition is likely computationally too expensive for some examples. This could be due to:
    - Large required `delta_r` values.
    - Large number of objects.
    - Large object sizes.
    - Combination of the above factors.
Potential Revision Areas:
  - The rule for calculating the downward shift needs simplification or correction. A simple gravity model (fall until blocked by *any* non-white pixel in the current output state or grid bottom) is a likely alternative.
  - Consider if *all* objects are meant to be copied and shifted, or only specific ones.
  - Confirm if original objects should remain or be removed after shifting/copying. (The previous code kept them).
