A pixel is considered enclosed if it's white (0) and cannot be reached from the grid border by moving only through non-blue pixels (i.e., any path from the border to the pixel must cross a blue pixel).\n2. Create a set of coordinates for these enclosed white pixels (`enclosed_set`).\n3. Find all white (0) pixels in the original input grid that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to any pixel in the `enclosed_set`. Create a set of coordinates for these adjacent white pixels (`adjacent_set`).\n4. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n5. Change the color of all pixels identified in `enclosed_set` to azure (8) in the output grid.\n6. Change the color of all pixels identified in `adjacent_set` to azure (8) in the output grid. (Note: these sets might overlap, which is fine).\n7.
