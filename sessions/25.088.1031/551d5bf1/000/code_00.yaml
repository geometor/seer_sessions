Input_Elements:
  - type: Background
    color: white (0)
  - type: Frame
    color: blue (1)
    structure: Closed loops of contiguous pixels
    properties:
      - Encloses regions of background pixels

Output_Elements:
  - type: Background
    color: white (0)
    status: Potentially reduced area compared to input
  - type: Frame
    color: blue (1)
    status: Unchanged from input
  - type: Fill
    color: azure (8)
    location:
      - Inside identified frames
      - In background pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the 'Inside' fill locations

Transformation:
  - action: Identify Objects
    target: Frames (blue loops)
  - action: Identify Regions
    target: Interior areas enclosed by Frames
    initial_color: white (0)
  - action: Identify Propagation Targets
    target: white (0) pixels
    condition: Must be adjacent (non-diagonally) to any pixel within an identified Interior area.
  - action: Generate Output Grid
    steps:
      - Copy input grid.
      - Change color of Interior area pixels to azure (8).
      - Change color of Propagation Target pixels to azure (8).

Relationships:
  - Containment: Frames contain Interior areas.
  - Adjacency: Propagation Target pixels are adjacent to Interior area pixels.
