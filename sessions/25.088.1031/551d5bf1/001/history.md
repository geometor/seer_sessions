Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Composition:** The input grids consist of a white (0) background populated by several closed shapes (frames) made of blue (1) pixels. These frames resemble hollow rectangles or squares of various sizes and positions.
2.  **Output Composition:** The output grids retain the original blue frames. The key change is the appearance of azure (8) pixels. These azure pixels fill the areas *inside* the blue frames and also appear in some locations immediately *outside* the frames.
3.  **Transformation Core Idea:** The transformation seems to involve identifying the enclosed regions within the blue frames and filling them with azure.
4.  **Propagation Effect:** Beyond just filling the interiors, the azure color "leaks" or propagates one step outwards (horizontally and vertically, not diagonally) from the filled interior into adjacent white pixels. If a white pixel is next to any part of the filled interior, it also becomes azure. This propagation appears to happen simultaneously based on the initial interior fill, meaning a newly propagated azure pixel doesn't cause further propagation in the same step.
5.  **Object Preservation:** The original blue frames remain entirely unchanged in terms of color and position. Only white pixels are potentially changed to azure.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input_Elements:
  - type: Background
    color: white (0)
  - type: Frame
    color: blue (1)
    structure: Closed loops of contiguous pixels
    properties:
      - Encloses regions of background pixels

Output_Elements:
  - type: Background
    color: white (0)
    status: Potentially reduced area compared to input
  - type: Frame
    color: blue (1)
    status: Unchanged from input
  - type: Fill
    color: azure (8)
    location:
      - Inside identified frames
      - In background pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the 'Inside' fill locations

Transformation:
  - action: Identify Objects
    target: Frames (blue loops)
  - action: Identify Regions
    target: Interior areas enclosed by Frames
    initial_color: white (0)
  - action: Identify Propagation Targets
    target: white (0) pixels
    condition: Must be adjacent (non-diagonally) to any pixel within an identified Interior area.
  - action: Generate Output Grid
    steps:
      - Copy input grid.
      - Change color of Interior area pixels to azure (8).
      - Change color of Propagation Target pixels to azure (8).

Relationships:
  - Containment: Frames contain Interior areas.
  - Adjacency: Propagation Target pixels are adjacent to Interior area pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new grid by copying the input grid. This will be the output grid.
2.  Find all groups of connected white (0) pixels that are completely enclosed by blue (1) pixels (these are the "interior regions" of the blue frames).
3.  Collect the coordinates of all pixels belonging to these interior regions. Let this be the `interior_set`.
4.  Create an empty set of coordinates called the `adjacent_set`.
5.  Iterate through each coordinate `(r, c)` in the `interior_set`. For each such coordinate, examine its four direct neighbors (up, down, left, right): `(r-1, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c+1)`.
6.  If a neighbor coordinate `(nr, nc)` is within the grid bounds and corresponds to a white (0) pixel in the *original input grid*, add `(nr, nc)` to the `adjacent_set`.
7.  Modify the output grid: For every coordinate `(r, c)` in the `interior_set`, change the pixel value at `output_grid[r][c]` to azure (8).
8.  Modify the output grid: For every coordinate `(r, c)` in the `adjacent_set`, change the pixel value at `output_grid[r][c]` to azure (8).
9.  Return the modified output grid.
