"""
Identify regions of white (0) pixels that are completely enclosed by blue (1) pixels. 
Then, identify the blue (1) pixels forming the immediate boundary of these enclosed regions.
Finally, color both the enclosed white pixels AND any white pixels adjacent to the boundary blue pixels with azure (8).

1.  Find all white (0) pixels completely enclosed by blue (1) pixels. 
    - This is done using a flood-fill starting from all non-blue border cells. 
    - Any white cell not reached by this flood fill is considered enclosed.
    - Store the coordinates of these enclosed white pixels in `enclosed_white_pixels`.
2.  Find all blue (1) pixels that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to any pixel in `enclosed_white_pixels`.
    - Store these coordinates in `boundary_blue_pixels`.
3.  Find all white (0) pixels (in the original grid) that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to any pixel in `boundary_blue_pixels`.
    - Store these coordinates in `adjacent_white_pixels`.
4.  Determine the final set of pixels to color azure (8). This is the union of `enclosed_white_pixels` and `adjacent_white_pixels`.
5.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
6.  Iterate through the final set of coordinates and change the corresponding pixel color to azure (8) in the output grid.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
