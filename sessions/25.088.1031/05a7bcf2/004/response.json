            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and plan the refinement.\n\n**1. General Assessment & Strategy**\n\n*   **Problem:** The provided Python code, designed to implement a specific grid transformation rule, fails with a timeout error on at least the first training example. This indicates either the implemented logic is computationally too expensive for the scale of the input, or there's an infinite loop (less likely based on the code structure, but possible), or the logic doesn't correctly terminate under certain conditions found in the failing example.\n*   **Code Logic Summary:** The code attempts to:\n    1.  Find a unique, full horizontal or vertical azure line (separator).\n    2.  Copy the input grid.\n    3.  Identify yellow (4) and red (2) pixels not on the separator.\n    4.  Change yellow pixels to green (3) in the output.\n    5.  For each original yellow/red pixel location, draw an azure path from the adjacent pixel towards the separator, stopping before it, only overwriting white (0) pixels.\n*   **Information Gap:** The most critical missing piece is the actual set of training examples (input/output pairs) and the test examples. Without them, I cannot verify the assumptions made by the code or pinpoint the exact reason for the timeout or other potential logical errors. The timeout strongly suggests performance issues, possibly in `find_separator` or due to a very large grid/many source pixels in the first example.\n*   **Strategy:**\n    1.  **Obtain Examples:** Access the full set of training examples associated with this task.\n    2.  **Analyze Failing Example(s):** Determine the characteristics of the example(s) causing the timeout (size, density of relevant pixels, separator properties). Manually trace the intended logic on this example to see if it matches the code's behaviour and the expected output.\n    3.  **Analyze All Examples:** Compare the code's logic against *all* input/output pairs to identify discrepancies. Pay close attention to:\n        *   Separator identification (uniqueness, completeness, color).\n        *   Source pixel identification and color transformation.\n        *   Projection path rules (start/end points, color, overwrite behavior).\n    4.  **Refine Algorithm:** Adjust the understanding of the rule based on the complete evidence from examples.\n    5.  **Optimize Implementation:** If the logic is confirmed but still slow, optimize the Python code (e.g., improve search efficiency in `find_separator`).\n    6.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the refined understanding.\n\n**2. Metrics Gathering (Simulated - Requires Actual Examples)**\n\nAssuming I have the examples, I would use `tool_code` to gather metrics like these for each example pair:\n\n"
