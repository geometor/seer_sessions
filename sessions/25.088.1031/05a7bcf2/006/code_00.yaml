Objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0) # Assumed, needs verification
      - contains: separator
      - contains: source_pixels
  - type: separator
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: line (horizontal or vertical)
      - topology: continuous
      - extent: spans full grid width or height
      - quantity: assumed unique per grid # Needs verification
  - type: source_pixel
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4) OR red (2) # Needs verification if other colors act as sources
      - location: not on the separator line
Actions:
  - action: initialize_output
    details: create a copy of the input grid
  - action: identify_separator
    target: grid
    output: separator object (with orientation and index)
    condition: separator must be unique and span the grid
    failure_mode: transformation might differ or not apply # Needs clarification
  - action: identify_sources
    target: grid
    input: separator object (for exclusion zone)
    output: list of source_pixel coordinates (r, c)
    criteria: color is yellow (4) or red (2); location is not on the separator
  - action: transform_source_color
    target: output_grid
    input: source_pixel coordinates
    condition: if the color at (r, c) in the *input* grid is yellow (4)
    effect: set color at (r, c) in *output* grid to green (3)
  - action: project_path
    target: output_grid
    trigger: for each identified source_pixel coordinate (r_source, c_source)
    input: separator object (orientation, index)
    effect:
      - determine orthogonal path from cell adjacent to (r_source, c_source) towards separator
      - path stops one cell before the separator index
      - set color of all cells along the path to azure (8)
      - overwrites any existing content on the path in the output_grid
Final_Output:
  - The state of the output_grid after all color transformations and path projections are complete.
