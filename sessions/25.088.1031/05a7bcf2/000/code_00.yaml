task_name: color_projection_with_separator
description: >
  Transforms a grid by projecting colors towards a central azure separator,
  changing the color of one set of objects and filling the projection path.

elements:
  - element: separator
    color: 8 # azure
    shape: straight line (horizontal row or vertical column)
    function: Divides the grid into two regions. Acts as a boundary for projections.
  - element: source_object_1
    color: 4 # yellow
    location: One side of the separator.
    action:
      - Projects towards the separator.
      - Changes color to green (3) in the output.
  - element: source_object_2
    color: 2 # red
    location: The other side of the separator.
    action:
      - Projects towards the separator.
      - Retains its color (2) in the output.
  - element: background
    color: 0 # white
    action:
      - If on the projection path between a source object (yellow or red) and the separator, changes to azure (8).
      - Otherwise, remains white (0).
  - element: projection_fill
    color: 8 # azure
    location: Fills the white space on the direct path between source objects (yellow/red) and the separator line/column.
  - element: transformed_object_1
    color: 3 # green
    location: Replaces original yellow objects (4).
