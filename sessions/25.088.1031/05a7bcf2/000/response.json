            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently feature a prominent line or column composed entirely of azure pixels (color 8). This azure structure acts as a separator, dividing the grid into two distinct regions.\n2.  **Separator Orientation:** The azure separator can be either a horizontal row (as in `train_1` and `train_3`) or a vertical column (as in `train_2`).\n3.  **Object Colors and Placement:**\n    *   One region contains scattered yellow objects (color 4).\n    *   The other region contains scattered red objects (color 2).\n    *   If the separator is horizontal, yellow objects are above it, and red objects are below it.\n    *   If the separator is vertical, yellow objects are to its left, and red objects are to its right.\n4.  **Background:** The rest of the grid is composed of white pixels (color 0).\n5.  **Output Transformation:** The output grid retains the azure separator and the red objects in their original positions. The key changes involve the yellow objects and the white space between the objects and the separator:\n    *   The original yellow pixels (4) are transformed into green pixels (3).\n    *   The white pixels (0) lying on the direct path *between* each original yellow/red pixel and the azure separator are changed to azure (8). This creates 'trails' or 'projections' of azure color extending from the objects towards the separator line/column.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
