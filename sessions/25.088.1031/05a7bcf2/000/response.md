Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently feature a prominent line or column composed entirely of azure pixels (color 8). This azure structure acts as a separator, dividing the grid into two distinct regions.
2.  **Separator Orientation:** The azure separator can be either a horizontal row (as in `train_1` and `train_3`) or a vertical column (as in `train_2`).
3.  **Object Colors and Placement:**
    *   One region contains scattered yellow objects (color 4).
    *   The other region contains scattered red objects (color 2).
    *   If the separator is horizontal, yellow objects are above it, and red objects are below it.
    *   If the separator is vertical, yellow objects are to its left, and red objects are to its right.
4.  **Background:** The rest of the grid is composed of white pixels (color 0).
5.  **Output Transformation:** The output grid retains the azure separator and the red objects in their original positions. The key changes involve the yellow objects and the white space between the objects and the separator:
    *   The original yellow pixels (4) are transformed into green pixels (3).
    *   The white pixels (0) lying on the direct path *between* each original yellow/red pixel and the azure separator are changed to azure (8). This creates 'trails' or 'projections' of azure color extending from the objects towards the separator line/column.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
task_name: color_projection_with_separator
description: >
  Transforms a grid by projecting colors towards a central azure separator,
  changing the color of one set of objects and filling the projection path.

elements:
  - element: separator
    color: 8 # azure
    shape: straight line (horizontal row or vertical column)
    function: Divides the grid into two regions. Acts as a boundary for projections.
  - element: source_object_1
    color: 4 # yellow
    location: One side of the separator.
    action:
      - Projects towards the separator.
      - Changes color to green (3) in the output.
  - element: source_object_2
    color: 2 # red
    location: The other side of the separator.
    action:
      - Projects towards the separator.
      - Retains its color (2) in the output.
  - element: background
    color: 0 # white
    action:
      - If on the projection path between a source object (yellow or red) and the separator, changes to azure (8).
      - Otherwise, remains white (0).
  - element: projection_fill
    color: 8 # azure
    location: Fills the white space on the direct path between source objects (yellow/red) and the separator line/column.
  - element: transformed_object_1
    color: 3 # green
    location: Replaces original yellow objects (4).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the azure separator line/column (pixels with value 8). Determine its orientation (horizontal or vertical) and its exact row or column index.
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
4.  **If the pixel is yellow (4):**
    *   Change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to green (3).
    *   Determine the projection direction towards the azure separator (downwards if the separator is horizontal and below the pixel; upwards if horizontal and above; rightwards if vertical and to the right; leftwards if vertical and to the left).
    *   Trace a path from the pixel *adjacent* to the yellow pixel (in the projection direction) up to (but not including) the azure separator line/column.
    *   For every pixel along this traced path, if its current value in the output grid is white (0), change it to azure (8).
5.  **If the pixel is red (2):**
    *   Keep the corresponding pixel in the output grid as red (2) (it's already copied).
    *   Determine the projection direction towards the azure separator (as described in step 4b).
    *   Trace a path from the pixel *adjacent* to the red pixel (in the projection direction) up to (but not including) the azure separator line/column.
    *   For every pixel along this traced path, if its current value in the output grid is white (0), change it to azure (8).
6.  Leave all other pixels (azure separator, original white background not on a projection path) unchanged from the initial copy.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
