Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1. Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2. Find a single, continuous line (horizontal or vertical) of azure (8) pixels that fully spans the grid's width or height. Record its orientation and index. Assume such a unique separator exists.
3. Identify the locations of all yellow (4) and red (2) source pixels in the *input* grid that are not on the separator line.
4. For each identified *yellow* source pixel location `(r, c)`, change the color in the *output* grid at `(r, c)` to green (3). Red source pixels remain red in the output grid initially (due to the copy).
5. For *each* identified source pixel location `(r_source, c_source)` (both original yellow and red):
    a. Determine the direct orthogonal path from the cell adjacent to `(r_source, c_source)` towards the separator line.
    b. The path extends up to, but does not include, the separator line itself.
    c. Iterate through each cell `(r_path, c_path)` along this path.
    d. Change the color of the cell `(r_path, c_path)` in the *output* grid to azure (8), overwriting any existing color at that location.

Results for code_00.py:
Train Set Error: Timeout: Code execution exceeded 10 seconds
## General Assessment

The provided Python code implements a transformation based on identifying a separator line and projecting source pixels (yellow and red) towards it, changing yellow to green in the process. The code timed out when tested against the training examples. This indicates potential issues:

1.  **Incorrect Logic:** The logic derived from the initial example might not generalize correctly to other examples in the training set. Assumptions about the uniqueness of the separator, the types of source pixels, or the exact projection rules might be flawed.
2.  **Inefficiency:** The implementation, particularly the path drawing (`draw_projection_path` called within a loop over all source pixels), could be too slow for larger grids or grids with many source pixels, leading to timeouts. The complexity might be higher than necessary.
3.  **Unhandled Cases:** The code might not handle edge cases gracefully (e.g., sources adjacent to the separator, multiple separators, no separators, unexpected colors). The current code returns the input copy if no unique separator is found, which might be incorrect for those examples.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Analyze Failed Examples:** Examine the specific training examples where the code likely failed or timed out (although the exact ones aren't specified, we must assume the logic breaks down somewhere). Use `tool_code` to inspect the inputs and outputs of the training set examples.
2.  **Gather Metrics:** Collect data on grid sizes, color distributions, separator presence/uniqueness, and source pixel characteristics across *all* training examples.
3.  **Refine Hypotheses:** Compare the inputs and outputs of all examples to identify variations or counter-examples to the initial assumptions. Pay close attention to:
    *   The exact definition and identification of the separator.
    *   The criteria for identifying source pixels.
    *   The precise color transformations applied.
    *   The rules for path projection (start, end, color, overwriting behavior).
4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the Facts YAML and the Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the transformation observed across all valid examples. Address any ambiguities or incorrect assumptions from the first attempt.

## Gather Metrics

Since the specific training data that caused the timeout isn't visible in this turn, I cannot run `tool_code` to gather metrics *directly* on those examples. However, based on the *intended logic* of the provided code and common ARC patterns, we can anticipate the types of metrics needed:

*   **Grid Dimensions:** Input/Output height and width for each example.
*   **Separator Presence:** Does each input grid contain a single, full azure line (horizontal or vertical)?
*   **Source Pixel Colors:** What colors (other than background and separator) appear in the input grids? Are they always yellow (4) and red (2)?
*   **Source Pixel Count:** How many source pixels are there in each input?
*   **Color Transformation:** Confirm if input yellow (4) consistently maps to output green (3) at the source location, and input red (2) maps to output red (2).
*   **Path Projection:** Verify if azure (8) paths are drawn orthogonally from *all* source locations towards the separator, stopping before it, and overwriting existing content.

*(Self-correction: Without the actual data, detailed metrics are impossible. The focus must shift to refining the descriptive logic based on the failure mode and the initial assumptions.)*

## Facts (YAML)

This reflects the understanding derived from the *first* example and the *intended* logic of the timed-out code. It needs validation against further examples.

      - path stops one cell before the separator index

      - overwrites any existing content on the path in the output_grid
Final_Output:

```


## Natural Language Program

This revised program maintains the core logic but emphasizes points needing verification due to the timeout.

1.  **Initialize:** Create an output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  **Find Separator:** Identify a single, continuous line of azure (8) pixels that fully spans the grid's width (horizontal) or height (vertical). Determine its orientation ('h' or 'v') and index (row or column number). *(Assumption: Such a unique separator exists in valid inputs)*.
3.  **Identify Sources:** Locate all pixels in the *input* grid that are colored yellow (4) or red (2) and are *not* part of the identified separator line. Record the coordinates `(r, c)` of these source pixels. *(Assumption: Only yellow and red act as sources)*.
4.  **Transform Yellow Sources:** For each identified source coordinate `(r, c)`, if the color in the *input* grid at `(r, c)` is yellow (4), change the color in the *output* grid at `(r, c)` to green (3). Leave red sources unchanged at their original location in the output grid for now.
5.  **Project Paths:** For *each* recorded source coordinate `(r_source, c_source)`:
    a.  Determine the straight orthogonal path segment starting from the cell adjacent to `(r_source, c_source)` and extending towards the separator line.
    b.  The path segment includes all cells up to, but *not including*, the separator line itself.
    c.  Set the color of every cell within this path segment in the *output* grid to azure (8). This projection overwrites any colors previously existing in those output grid cells (including background, potentially transformed source pixels from step 4 if they lie on a path, or segments of other paths).
6.  **Finalize:** The resulting output grid contains the original separator line, the transformed source pixels (green or red), and the azure projection paths.
