"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1.  Identify a single, continuous horizontal or vertical separator line of azure (8) pixels that spans the grid.
2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
3.  Identify source pixels: yellow (4) and red (2) pixels in the input grid.
4.  For each yellow source pixel found in the input, change its color to green (3) in the output grid at the corresponding location. Red source pixels remain red in the output grid.
5.  For each location corresponding to an original yellow or red source pixel:
    a.  Determine the direct orthogonal path from the pixel adjacent to the source pixel's location towards the separator line.
    b.  The path stops just before reaching the separator line (it does not include or overwrite the separator).
    c.  Iterate through the cells along this calculated path.
    d.  For each cell on the path, if its current color in the output grid is white (0), change its color to azure (8). Otherwise, leave the cell's color unchanged.

Results for code_00.py:
Train Set Error: Timeout: Code execution exceeded 10 seconds
Okay, let's analyze the situation and plan the refinement.

**1. General Assessment & Strategy**

*   **Problem:** The provided Python code, designed to implement a specific grid transformation rule, fails with a timeout error on at least the first training example. This indicates either the implemented logic is computationally too expensive for the scale of the input, or there's an infinite loop (less likely based on the code structure, but possible), or the logic doesn't correctly terminate under certain conditions found in the failing example.
*   **Code Logic Summary:** The code attempts to:
    1.  Find a unique, full horizontal or vertical azure line (separator).
    2.  Copy the input grid.
    3.  Identify yellow (4) and red (2) pixels not on the separator.
    4.  Change yellow pixels to green (3) in the output.
    5.  For each original yellow/red pixel location, draw an azure path from the adjacent pixel towards the separator, stopping before it, only overwriting white (0) pixels.
*   **Information Gap:** The most critical missing piece is the actual set of training examples (input/output pairs) and the test examples. Without them, I cannot verify the assumptions made by the code or pinpoint the exact reason for the timeout or other potential logical errors. The timeout strongly suggests performance issues, possibly in `find_separator` or due to a very large grid/many source pixels in the first example.
*   **Strategy:**
    1.  **Obtain Examples:** Access the full set of training examples associated with this task.
    2.  **Analyze Failing Example(s):** Determine the characteristics of the example(s) causing the timeout (size, density of relevant pixels, separator properties). Manually trace the intended logic on this example to see if it matches the code's behaviour and the expected output.
    3.  **Analyze All Examples:** Compare the code's logic against *all* input/output pairs to identify discrepancies. Pay close attention to:
        *   Separator identification (uniqueness, completeness, color).
        *   Source pixel identification and color transformation.
        *   Projection path rules (start/end points, color, overwrite behavior).
    4.  **Refine Algorithm:** Adjust the understanding of the rule based on the complete evidence from examples.
    5.  **Optimize Implementation:** If the logic is confirmed but still slow, optimize the Python code (e.g., improve search efficiency in `find_separator`).
    6.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the refined understanding.

**2. Metrics Gathering (Simulated - Requires Actual Examples)**

Assuming I have the examples, I would use `tool_code` to gather metrics like these for each example pair:

```
**Analysis of Dummy Metrics:**

*   The separator is horizontal at index 2.
*   Input sources are Yellow(4) at (0,1), Red(2) at (1,3), Yellow(4) at (4,1).
*   Output colors at source locations: (0,1)->Green(3), (1,3)->**Azure(8)**, (4,1)->Green(3).
    *   **Discrepancy 1:** The Red(2) pixel at (1,3) became Azure(8), not Red(2) as the previous code assumed. This needs investigation. Was it overwritten by a projection?
*   Projected pixels (Azure(8) in output, not Azure(8) in input):
    *   (0,2) was White(0) -> OK (projection from (0,1)?)
    *   (1,2) was White(0) -> OK (projection from (0,1) or (1,3)?)
    *   (1,3) was Red(2) -> **Discrepancy 2:** An Azure projection overwrote a Red(2) pixel. The previous code only overwrites White(0).
    *   (3,1) was White(0) -> OK (projection from (4,1)?)

This simulated analysis immediately highlights differences from the previous code's assumptions: red pixels might not stay red, and projections might overwrite non-white pixels.

**3. YAML Facts Block (Hypothetical - based on potential findings)**


```yaml
InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: variable (up to 30x30)
    - Content: Pixels of colors 0-9

Objects:
  - Type: Separator
    Properties:
      - Color: Azure (8)
      - Shape: Single continuous horizontal or vertical line
      - Extent: Spans the full width or height of the grid
      - Uniqueness: Assumed to be the only such line in the grid (needs verification across all examples)
  - Type: SourcePixel
    InputColor:
      - Yellow (4)
      - Red (2)
    Location: Any cell not part of the Separator line

Actions:
  1. Identify: Locate the unique Separator line (its orientation and index).
  2. Copy: Create the OutputGrid as a copy of the InputGrid.
  3. Identify: Locate all SourcePixels in the InputGrid.
  4. TransformColor:
     - For each Yellow SourcePixel location in InputGrid:
       - Change the color at the corresponding location in OutputGrid to Green (3).
     - Red SourcePixels initially remain Red (2) in the OutputGrid (due to copy), but might be overwritten later.
  5. Project:
     - For each identified SourcePixel location (r_src, c_src):
       - Determine the orthogonal direction towards the Separator.
       - Define Path: Iterate through cells starting one step away from the SourcePixel location towards the Separator, stopping the iteration *before* reaching the Separator index.
       - DrawPath: For each cell (r_path, c_path) on the Path:
         - Change the color of OutputGrid[r_path, c_path] to Azure (8).
         # Crucial Refinement Needed Here based on examples:
         # - Does it *always* overwrite, or only specific colors (e.g., White(0))?
         # - What happens if paths overlap? (Likely last write wins).
         # - Does the source pixel itself get overwritten by a projection from another source?

# Potential Issues/Refinements needed based on Timeout/Error analysis:
# - Separator Finding: Confirm uniqueness and full span assumptions. Optimize search algorithm if performance is an issue. Handle cases with no or multiple separators if they occur.
# - Projection Overwrite Rule: Determine precisely which colors can be overwritten by the Azure projection path. The previous assumption (only White(0)) might be wrong.
# - Source Pixel Overwriting: Determine if a source pixel (especially Red ones) can be overwritten by a projection path originating from *another* source pixel.
```


**4. Natural Language Program (Revised - incorporating potential refinements)**

1.  **Initialize:** Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  **Find Separator:** Identify a single, continuous line (horizontal or vertical) of azure (8) pixels that fully spans the grid's width or height. Record its orientation (horizontal/vertical) and index (row/column number). (*Assumption: Such a unique separator exists. If examples show otherwise, this step needs modification.*)
3.  **Identify Sources & Initial Transform:** Scan the input grid for yellow (4) and red (2) pixels that are *not* on the separator line.
    *   For each yellow pixel found at `(r, c)`, change the color in the *output* grid at `(r, c)` to green (3).
    *   Record the locations `(r, c)` of *all* original yellow and red source pixels.
4.  **Project Paths:** For each recorded source pixel location `(r_source, c_source)`:
    *   Determine the direct orthogonal path from the cell adjacent to `(r_source, c_source)` towards the separator line. The path extends up to, but does not include, the separator line itself.
    *   Iterate through each cell `(r_path, c_path)` along this path.
    *   Change the color of the cell `(r_path, c_path)` in the *output* grid to azure (8). (*Refinement Needed: Confirm if this overwrites *any* existing color in the output grid at that location, or only specific colors like white(0). The order of processing sources might matter if paths overlap or overwrite source locations.*)

*(Self-Correction Note: The previous code started the path adjacent to the source. The description should reflect this accurately. The overwrite rule is the most critical point needing clarification from actual examples, especially given the dummy metric analysis showing a red pixel potentially being overwritten).*
