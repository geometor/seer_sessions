facts:
  - Abstraction: Identify template shapes and target shapes based on color.
  - Objects:
      - Template Objects: Contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels, considering 8-way adjacency (orthogonal and diagonal).
      - Target Objects: Contiguous blocks of red (2) pixels, considering 8-way adjacency.
  - Properties:
      - Shape: The set of relative coordinates (dr, dc) of pixels within a block, normalized to the top-left corner of its bounding box. Adjacency matters for defining the block.
      - Bounding Box (BBox): The minimum rectangle enclosing the block (height, width).
  - Actions:
      - Find all unique Template Objects (azure). Store their Shape and BBox dimensions.
      - Find all Target Objects (red).
      - For each Target Object:
          - Calculate its Shape and BBox dimensions.
          - Check if its (Shape, BBox Height, BBox Width) tuple exactly matches any stored Template Object tuple.
          - If a match is found, change the color of all pixels belonging to that Target Object from red (2) to azure (8) in the output grid.
      - All other pixels retain their original color.
