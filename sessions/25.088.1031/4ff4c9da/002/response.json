            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided Python code implements a reasonable hypothesis based on the initial examples: identify template shapes from azure (8) blocks and recolor any non-white, non-azure blocks that match these templates (in shape and bounding box) to azure.\n\nThis strategy worked perfectly for the first two training examples. However, it failed on the third example. The `Transformed Output` for Example 3 changed *more* blocks to azure than the `Expected Output`. This indicates that the initial hypothesis (and the code implementing it) is too broad; there must be an additional condition or constraint determining *which* matching blocks should be recolored.\n\nThe current code finds *all* azure shapes, stores their geometries, and then recolors *any* other colored block that matches *any* of those stored geometries. The failure in Example 3 suggests that either not all azure blocks serve as templates, or not all matching blocks should be transformed.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Gather detailed metrics on all examples, focusing on the properties of the azure blocks and the blocks that change color in the *expected* output vs. the *transformed* output, especially for Example 3.\n2.  Identify the specific blocks that were incorrectly changed in Example 3 by the current code.\n3.  Analyze the properties (location, neighbors, relation to azure blocks) of the correctly changed blocks versus the incorrectly changed blocks in Example 3 to find the missing condition.\n4.  Update the factual observations (YAML) and the natural language program to reflect the refined understanding, explicitly noting the condition discovered. If a clear condition cannot be determined from the provided examples, the natural language program should reflect the best current hypothesis while acknowledging the discrepancy in Example 3.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's gather some specific data about the examples. We need to identify the azure template shapes and the target shapes that get changed.\n\n"
