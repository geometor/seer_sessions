Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided Python code implements a reasonable hypothesis based on the initial examples: identify template shapes from azure (8) blocks and recolor any non-white, non-azure blocks that match these templates (in shape and bounding box) to azure.

This strategy worked perfectly for the first two training examples. However, it failed on the third example. The `Transformed Output` for Example 3 changed *more* blocks to azure than the `Expected Output`. This indicates that the initial hypothesis (and the code implementing it) is too broad; there must be an additional condition or constraint determining *which* matching blocks should be recolored.

The current code finds *all* azure shapes, stores their geometries, and then recolors *any* other colored block that matches *any* of those stored geometries. The failure in Example 3 suggests that either not all azure blocks serve as templates, or not all matching blocks should be transformed.

**Strategy:**
1.  Gather detailed metrics on all examples, focusing on the properties of the azure blocks and the blocks that change color in the *expected* output vs. the *transformed* output, especially for Example 3.
2.  Identify the specific blocks that were incorrectly changed in Example 3 by the current code.
3.  Analyze the properties (location, neighbors, relation to azure blocks) of the correctly changed blocks versus the incorrectly changed blocks in Example 3 to find the missing condition.
4.  Update the factual observations (YAML) and the natural language program to reflect the refined understanding, explicitly noting the condition discovered. If a clear condition cannot be determined from the provided examples, the natural language program should reflect the best current hypothesis while acknowledging the discrepancy in Example 3.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's gather some specific data about the examples. We need to identify the azure template shapes and the target shapes that get changed.
