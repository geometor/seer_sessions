They contain various colors, with White (0) often acting as a background or separator. Colors like Blue (1) and Red (2) frequently form repeating lines or patterns, suggesting a structured background.\n2.  **Key Color:** The Azure (8) color plays a crucial role. It appears in specific locations in the input grids.\n3.  **Transformation:** The primary change between input and output grids is the appearance of *new* Azure (8) pixels in the output. These new Azure pixels replace pixels of other colors (primarily Blue (1) or Red (2) in the examples).\n4.  **Pattern Recognition:** The Azure (8) pixels in the input form distinct shapes or patterns (e.g., a plus sign, a bar, a 2x1 block, a 1x2 block).\n5.  **Rule Inference:** The transformation seems to involve using the Azure (8) shapes found in the input as templates. The process finds other locations in the grid that contain the *exact same shape* but are composed of a *single* other color (like Blue (1) or Red (2)). These found shapes are then \"recolored\" to match the template color, Azure (8). The original Azure shapes remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
