elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - structural_colors: [blue (1), red (2)]
      - template_color: azure (8)
      - size: constant between input and output (e.g., 21x21, 23x23, 17x17)

objects:
  - object: source_pattern
    description: A contiguous block of one or more azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: relative coordinates of constituent pixels
      - bounding_box_size: height and width of the smallest rectangle enclosing the shape

  - object: target_pattern
    description: A block of pixels in the input grid identified for transformation.
    properties:
      - shape: must exactly match the shape of a source_pattern
      - bounding_box_size: must exactly match the bounding_box_size of the corresponding source_pattern
      - color: must be composed entirely of a single color, which is not azure (8) and not white (0).

actions:
  - action: identify_source_patterns
    description: Find all maximal contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list of source_patterns (shape, bounding_box_size)

  - action: find_target_patterns
    description: For each source_pattern, search the input grid for blocks matching its shape and bounding_box_size, composed of a single non-azure, non-white color.
    inputs: input_grid, list of source_patterns
    outputs: list of target_patterns (location, shape, original_color)

  - action: recolor_target_patterns
    description: Change the color of all pixels within each identified target_pattern to azure (8).
    inputs: output_grid (initially a copy of input_grid), list of target_patterns
    outputs: modified output_grid

relationships:
  - relationship: shape_matching
    description: A target_pattern must have the identical relative pixel coordinates (shape) and bounding box size as a source_pattern.
  - relationship: color_constraint
    description: A target_pattern must consist of only one color, and that color cannot be azure (8) or white (0).
