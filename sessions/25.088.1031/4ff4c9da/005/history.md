"""
Identifies unique shapes formed by contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels in the 
input grid. These serve as templates. Then, searches the input grid specifically 
for contiguous blocks of red (2) pixels. If a red block exactly matches the 
shape and bounding box size of any identified azure template shape, that red 
block is recolored to azure (8) in the output grid. Other colors are ignored 
for transformation.

**Analysis of Code Execution Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Azure Template: Found one template: `shape=frozenset({(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0)})`, `bbox_h=3`, `bbox_w=3`. This matches my manual check of the 'H' shape.
    *   Red Inputs: The code found **only one** red block: a massive block covering almost all red pixels with `bbox_h=21`, `bbox_w=21`. This is **incorrect**. The `find_contiguous_blocks` function seems to have failed drastically here. It should have found four distinct 'H' shapes made of red pixels and potentially other red blocks (like the horizontal lines). The failure in Example 1 is due to the block-finding algorithm, not the matching logic itself (though the matching logic couldn't be tested correctly). The red pixels in rows 3, 7, 11, 15, 19 form long horizontal lines that connect the 'H' shapes horizontally. The BFS likely treated all connected red pixels as one giant object. **Crucially, the BFS implementation only considers orthogonal neighbours.** Let's re-check Example 1 input:
        *   Row 3: `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2`
        *   Row 4: `0 0 1 2 0 1 0 2 1 0 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 8 0 2 1` (Red H starts here at (4,6))
        *   Row 5: `1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 8 8 8 2 1` (Red H middle at (5,5), (5,6), (5,7))
        *   Row 6: `0 0 1 2 0 1 0 2 1 0 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 8 0 2 1` (Red H bottom at (6,6))
        *   Row 7: `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2`
        The red pixels in the 'H' shapes *are* connected orthogonally to the red horizontal lines. Thus, `find_contiguous_blocks` *correctly*, according to its definition (orthogonal adjacency), finds one huge red block.
        This means the initial assumption about the task was wrong. The "objects" are not just contiguous blocks of the *same* color if they touch other blocks of the same color. We need to redefine what constitutes the "shape" to be transformed.
        Looking at the input/output again: The transformation only happens to the 'H' shapes, *not* the horizontal lines. The azure template is only the 'H' shape.
        *New Hypothesis:* Find azure template shapes. Find *occurrences* of these exact pixel patterns (relative coordinates) using the red color within the grid, *regardless* of whether the red pixels are part of a larger contiguous red block.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Azure Templates: The code found **five** templates: four are single pixels (`shape=frozenset({(0,0)})`, `bbox_h=1`, `bbox_w=1`) and one is the 3x1 rectangle (`shape=frozenset({(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 0)})`, `bbox_h=1`, `bbox_w=3`).
        *   Wait, where did the single pixels come from? Let's re-examine input grid 3, azure (8).
            *   `grid3_in[4,5]=8`
            *   `grid3_in[5,4]=8`
            *   `grid3_in[5,6]=8`
            *   `grid3_in[6,5]=8`
            *   `grid3_in[9,0]=8`, `grid3_in[9,1]=8`, `grid3_in[9,2]=8`
        *   The 'L' shape! The `find_contiguous_blocks` using only orthogonal neighbours *breaks* the 'L' shape into four separate single-pixel blocks because the corners are only diagonally connected. The `find_contiguous_blocks` function needs to consider diagonal adjacency if shapes like 'L' are meant to be treated as single objects.
        *   Let's assume diagonal adjacency *is* needed for finding the template shapes. If the azure 'L' was found correctly, `source_patterns` would contain `{(l_shape, 3, 3), (rect_shape, 3, 1)}`.
    *   Red Inputs: The code correctly identifies many red blocks. Crucially, it finds many single red pixels (e.g., at [4,9], [5,8], [5,10], [6,9], etc.) and reports `matches_template=True` for them. This is because the (incorrectly identified) azure templates *include* single pixels. So, the code *is* matching single red pixels to single azure pixel templates.
    *   The failure in Example 3 is also caused by `find_contiguous_blocks` only using orthogonal adjacency, leading to incorrect template identification (breaking the L shape). This incorrect template set then leads to incorrect transformations (matching single red pixels).

**Revised Strategy:**

1.  The core concept seems to be: Use azure shapes as templates to find and replace identical red shapes.
2.  **Crucial Refinement:** Objects (shapes) must be defined by **contiguous pixels including diagonal connections** for finding both the azure templates and the red shapes to be potentially replaced. The `find_contiguous_blocks` function needs modification.
3.  The transformation applies to *all* red shapes found (using diagonal adjacency) that exactly match the shape (relative coordinates, considering diagonals) and bounding box of *any* azure template shape (also found using diagonal adjacency).

Let's re-evaluate Example 1 with diagonal adjacency:
*   Azure Template: The 'H' shape is still contiguous even with diagonals. Shape `frozenset({(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)})`, Bbox 3x3.
*   Red Shapes:
    *   The horizontal lines (rows 3, 7, etc.) are distinct objects.
    *   The four 'H' shapes are distinct objects. Their shape and bbox match the azure template.
    *   Other red pixels (e.g., the vertical lines connecting the horizontal ones) form other distinct objects.
*   With diagonal adjacency, `find_contiguous_blocks` should find the four red 'H' shapes separately. The matching logic `(shape, bbox_h, bbox_w) in source_patterns` should then work correctly for all four, leading to the expected output.

Let's re-evaluate Example 3 with diagonal adjacency:
*   Azure Templates:
    *   The 'L' shape pixels `(4,5), (5,4), (5,6), (6,5)` would be found as one block. Shape `frozenset({(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)})`, Bbox 3x3.
    *   The 3x1 rectangle `(9,0), (9,1), (9,2)` would be found as one block. Shape `frozenset({(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)})`, Bbox 1x3. (Wait, the code output said 3x1... `find_contiguous_blocks` output `min_r: 9, min_c: 0`, shape `frozenset({(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 0)})`, bbox_h: 1, bbox_w: 3. Yes, 1x3.)
*   Red Shapes (with diagonal adjacency):
    *   Red 'L' at [4,9]: Pixels (4,10), (5,9), (5,11), (6,10). Should be found. Shape `frozenset({(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)})`, Bbox 3x3. Matches Azure 'L'. -> Transform.
    *   Red 'L' at [8,5]: Pixels (8,6), (9,5), (9,7), (10,6). Should be found. Shape `frozenset({(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)})`, Bbox 3x3. Matches Azure 'L'. -> Transform.
    *   Red 'L' at [8,9]: Pixels (8,10), (9,9), (9,11), (10,10). Should be found. Shape `frozenset({(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)})`, Bbox 3x3. Matches Azure 'L'. -> Transform.
    *   Red 1x3 Rect at [14,0]: Pixels (14,0), (14,1), (14,2). Should be found. Shape `frozenset({(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)})`, Bbox 1x3. Matches Azure Rect. -> Transform.
    *   Single red pixels (e.g., at [9,16]): Found as shape `frozenset({(0,0)})`, Bbox 1x1. No matching azure template. -> Do NOT transform.
*   This revised logic matches the expected output for Example 3 perfectly.

Conclusion: The key missing element was using diagonal adjacency for finding contiguous blocks.

```natural_language_program
# Natural Language Program: Shape Substitution with Diagonal Adjacency

1.  **Define Objects:** Objects are contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color. Connectivity is defined by 8-way adjacency (pixels are connected if they touch orthogonally or diagonally).
2.  **Identify Azure Templates:** Find all distinct contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels in the input grid using 8-way adjacency.
3.  **Extract Template Properties:** For each unique azure block found, determine its shape (the set of relative pixel coordinates within its bounding box) and the dimensions (height, width) of its bounding box. Store these unique (shape, bbox_height, bbox_w) tuples as the set of valid templates.
4.  **Identify Red Candidates:** Find all distinct contiguous blocks of red (2) pixels in the input grid using 8-way adjacency.
5.  **Match and Transform:** Iterate through each red block found.
    a.  Determine its shape and bounding box dimensions.
    b.  Check if the tuple (shape, bbox_height, bbox_w) for this red block exists in the set of valid azure templates identified in step 3.
    c.  If an exact match is found, recolor all pixels belonging to this red block to azure (8) in the output grid.
6.  **Output:** The output grid contains the original pixels, except for the red blocks that matched an azure template, which are now azure.
```
## General Assessment

The previous code correctly solved Example 2 but failed on Examples 1 and 3. The core logic involved identifying azure (8) shapes as templates and recoloring red (2) shapes that matched these templates in terms of shape (relative coordinates) and bounding box size.

Analysis of the failures using the provided execution results and `tool_code` revealed a critical flaw in the object identification step:
1.  **Adjacency Rule:** The `find_contiguous_blocks` function used only orthogonal (4-way) adjacency.
2.  **Example 1 Failure:** Because the red 'H' shapes were connected to large horizontal red bars via orthogonal adjacency, the code incorrectly identified almost all red pixels as a single, massive object, preventing the matching of the smaller 'H' template.
3.  **Example 3 Failure:** Using only orthogonal adjacency caused the azure 'L' shape template to be broken into four single-pixel templates. This led to the incorrect transformation of single red pixels in the output, as they matched these single-pixel templates.

The resolution requires modifying the definition of object contiguity to use **8-way adjacency (orthogonal and diagonal)** for identifying both the azure template shapes and the red candidate shapes. With this change, the intended logic (matching shape and bounding box) should correctly handle all examples.

## Metrics

The `tool_code` execution confirmed the following, highlighting the issues caused by using only orthogonal adjacency:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Azure Templates (Orthogonal):** Correctly identified one 'H' shape template (Shape: `frozenset({(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)})`, BBox: 3x3).
    *   **Red Inputs (Orthogonal):** Incorrectly identified only *one* large red object (BBox: 21x21) due to connections via horizontal red lines. No red 'H' shapes were isolated. Result: No matches found for the 'H' shape among the (incorrectly identified) red objects, except perhaps coincidentally if the single large object happened to have the same bbox dimensions (which it didn't).
*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Azure Templates (Orthogonal):** Incorrectly identified the 'L' shape as four separate single-pixel templates (Shape: `frozenset({(0,0)})`, BBox: 1x1) and correctly identified the 1x3 rectangle template.
    *   **Red Inputs (Orthogonal):** Found various red blocks, including many single red pixels.
    *   **Matching (Orthogonal):** The code correctly matched the red 1x3 rectangle to the azure 1x3 template. However, it *incorrectly* matched several single red pixels to the single-pixel azure templates derived from the fragmented 'L' shape. This caused the incorrect transformations observed in the output.

## Natural Language Program


```natural_language_program
# Natural Language Program: Shape Substitution with 8-Way Adjacency

1.  **Define Object Connectivity:** Consider pixels to be part of the same object if they share the same color and are connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (8-way adjacency).
2.  **Identify Azure Template Shapes:** Find all distinct contiguous blocks (objects) of azure (8) pixels in the input grid based on 8-way adjacency.
3.  **Characterize Templates:** For each unique azure object found:
    a.  Calculate its bounding box (minimum enclosing rectangle).
    b.  Determine its shape by recording the coordinates of its pixels relative to the top-left corner of its bounding box.
    c.  Store the unique combination of (shape, bounding_box_height, bounding_box_width) as a valid template pattern.
4.  **Identify Red Candidate Shapes:** Find all distinct contiguous blocks (objects) of red (2) pixels in the input grid based on 8-way adjacency.
5.  **Perform Substitution:** Iterate through each red object found:
    a.  Calculate its shape and bounding box dimensions using the same method as for templates (step 3a-b).
    b.  Check if the combination (shape, bounding_box_height, bounding_box_width) for this red object exactly matches any of the valid template patterns stored in step 3c.
    c.  If an exact match is found, update the output grid by changing the color of all pixels belonging to this specific red object to azure (8).
6.  **Construct Output:** The final output grid is the input grid modified only by the color changes specified in step 5c. All other pixels remain unchanged.
