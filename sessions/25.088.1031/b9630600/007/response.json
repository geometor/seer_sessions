Identify all white pixels (color 0) that are located on the absolute border of the grid (first row, last row, first column, last column). These are the starting points for identifying the \"exterior\".\n3. Perform a search (like Breadth-First Search) starting from these border white pixels. Explore outwards, moving only between adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels. Keep track of all white pixels visited during this search. These visited white pixels constitute the \"exterior white regions\".\n4. Iterate through each pixel of the original input grid.\n5. If a pixel is white (color 0) in the input grid AND it was *not* visited during the search in step 3 (meaning it's not part of an exterior white region), then it belongs to an \"interior white region\".\n6. Change the color of this corresponding pixel in the output grid to green (color 3).\n7. All other pixels (original non-white pixels and the exterior white pixels identified in step 3) retain their original colors in the output grid.\n8. Return the completed output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Fills enclosed white regions (color 0) with green (color 3). \n    It identifies white regions connected to the grid boundary using BFS \n    and fills only the white regions not connected to the boundary.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
