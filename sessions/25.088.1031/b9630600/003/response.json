Identify all white pixels (color 0) located on the outermost border (rows 0 and height-1, columns 0 and width-1) of the input grid.\n3. Perform a traversal (Flood Fill using Breadth-First Search - BFS) starting from these border white pixels. \n   This traversal explores all connected white pixels, moving only between adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels. \n   Mark all visited white pixels during this traversal as \"connected to the boundary\" or \"exterior\".\n4. Iterate through every pixel of the input grid.\n5. If a pixel is white (color 0) in the input grid AND it was *not* marked as \"connected to the boundary\" during the traversal step, \n   change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to green (color 3). These are the \"interior\" white pixels.\n6. All other pixels (original green pixels, original non-white pixels, and white pixels connected to the boundary) \n   retain their original color in the output grid.\n7.
