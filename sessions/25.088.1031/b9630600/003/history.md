Transformation Rule:
1. Identify all hollow rectangular shapes formed by green (3) pixels on a white (0) background in the input grid.
2. Fill the interior white (0) area enclosed by each green rectangle with green (3) pixels.
3. Pixels originally green and pixels outside any rectangle remain unchanged.

Implementation Strategy:
Use a flood fill (Breadth-First Search - BFS) algorithm starting from the white pixels on the boundary of the grid. 
Any white pixel reachable from the boundary is considered "outside". 
Any white pixel *not* reachable from the boundary must be enclosed within a shape (in this case, the green rectangles). 
These enclosed white pixels are then changed to green.

Results for code_00.py:
Train Set Error: Timeout: Code execution exceeded 10 seconds
Okay, let's analyze the situation based on the provided code and the timeout result.

## General Assessment

The provided Python code attempts to solve the task by identifying white pixels enclosed within green rectangular shapes and filling them with green. It uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm starting from the white pixels on the grid's boundary to identify all "exterior" white pixels. Any white pixel *not* visited by this BFS is assumed to be "interior" and is subsequently filled with green.

The code timed out during execution on the training set. This indicates that the BFS algorithm, as implemented, is too slow for the scale or complexity of the input grids in the training examples. Potential reasons include:

1.  **Large Grids:** The grids might be large (approaching 30x30), leading to a large number of pixels to visit during the BFS.
2.  **Complex Boundaries:** The green shapes might form complex boundaries, or there might be large contiguous areas of white pixels connected to the boundary, causing the BFS queue to become very large.
3.  **Inefficient Implementation:** While BFS is generally efficient, specific implementation details or the sheer number of boundary starting points could contribute to the timeout.

The core logic (identifying enclosed white regions via boundary connectivity) seems plausible based on the initial description. However, the timeout necessitates either an optimization of this approach or potentially a re-evaluation of the transformation rule if the "enclosed region" concept was misinterpreted or oversimplified.

**Strategy:**

1.  Re-examine the transformation logic based on all examples (if they were available) to confirm the "fill enclosed white regions bounded by green" hypothesis holds true across all cases.
2.  Assume the logic is correct for now and focus on describing it clearly. The timeout is an *implementation* issue, which will be addressed in the coder phase. The natural language program should still describe the intended transformation accurately.

## Metrics

Due to the timeout, specific metrics about the transformation's success or failure on individual examples cannot be gathered. The primary metric available is:

*   **Training Set Execution:** Timeout (> 10 seconds).

This implies the computational complexity of the implemented `transform` function exceeds the allowed limits for at least one training example.

      - Method: Breadth-First Search (BFS) or similar graph traversal.
      - Start: White pixels on the grid boundary.
      - Condition: Move between adjacent White pixels.
      - Goal: Mark all reachable White pixels from the boundary ('Exterior').

      - Target: White pixels *not* marked as 'Exterior'.
      - Condition: Pixel is White (0) and was not reached by the boundary traversal.
      - Color: Change target pixel color to Green (3).
  - Copy:
      - Source: Input Grid
      - Destination: Output Grid (initially identical to input)

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally or vertically.
  - Containment: Green shapes enclose regions of White pixels.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify all white pixels (color 0) located on the outermost border (rows 0 and height-1, columns 0 and width-1) of the input grid.
3.  Perform a traversal (like Flood Fill or BFS) starting from these border white pixels. This traversal explores all connected white pixels, moving only between adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels. Mark all visited white pixels during this traversal as "connected to the boundary".
4.  Iterate through every pixel of the input grid.
5.  If a pixel is white (color 0) in the input grid AND it was *not* marked as "connected to the boundary" during the traversal step, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to green (color 3).
6.  All other pixels (original green pixels, original non-white/non-green pixels, and white pixels connected to the boundary) retain their original color in the output grid.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
