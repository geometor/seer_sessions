objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - height: variable (1-30)
      - width: variable (1-30)
      - pixels: cells with colors (0-9)
  - type: region
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - connectivity: contiguous (sharing sides)
      - location: 
          - exterior: connected to the grid boundary via a path of white pixels
          - interior: not connected to the grid boundary via a path of white pixels
  - type: boundary
    properties:
      - composition: pixels of any non-white color
      - role: separates interior white regions from exterior white regions or the grid edge

actions:
  - name: identify_exterior_white_regions
    using: Flood Fill (BFS)
    start_points: White pixels located on the grid's outermost rows/columns (row 0, row H-1, col 0, col W-1)
    traversal: Move between adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels.
    result: Marks all reachable white pixels as 'exterior'.
  - name: identify_interior_white_regions
    method: Check all white pixels in the input grid.
    condition: The pixel was *not* marked as 'exterior' by the flood fill.
  - name: fill_interior_white_regions
    target: Pixels identified as 'interior' white regions.
    new_color: green (3)
  - name: preserve_pixels
    target: All non-white pixels from the input.
    target: All 'exterior' white pixels.
    action: Keep their original color in the output grid.
