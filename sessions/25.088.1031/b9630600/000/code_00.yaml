facts:
  - setup:
      description: The input grid consists of a white background (0) containing one or more distinct objects.
      background_color: white
      objects:
        - object_description: Hollow rectangular shapes.
          shape: Rectangle
          color: green
          property: Hollow (boundary pixels are green, interior pixels are white)
          count: variable (1 or more per example)
          connectivity: Contiguous green pixels forming the rectangle boundary.
  - transformation:
      description: The interior region enclosed by each hollow green rectangle is filled with green.
      action: Identify each hollow green rectangle.
      action_detail: Fill the area strictly inside the boundaries of each identified rectangle.
      target_pixels: white pixels located within the enclosed area of a green rectangle.
      fill_color: green
      unchanged_pixels:
        - All original green pixels forming the rectangle boundaries.
        - All white pixels located outside the boundaries of any rectangle.
  - output:
      description: The output grid contains the original green rectangles, but now they are filled solid green.
      resulting_objects: Solid green rectangles.
      background_color: white (remains unchanged where it was not inside a rectangle).
