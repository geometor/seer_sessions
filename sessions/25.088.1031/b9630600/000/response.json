These rectangles vary in size and position across the examples. The corresponding output grids show the same green rectangles, but the white pixels enclosed within the boundaries of each rectangle have been filled with green (3) pixels. Pixels outside these rectangular areas remain unchanged (white). The core transformation is the filling of the interior area of these hollow green rectangles.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
