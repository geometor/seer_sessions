Objects:
  - Grid:
      Properties:
        - Height: Integer (1-30)
        - Width: Integer (1-30)
        - Pixels: Collection of Pixel objects
  - Pixel:
      Properties:
        - Color: Integer (0-9), representing White(0), Green(3), etc.
        - Location: (Row, Column) coordinate
        - State: Can be considered 'Boundary' or 'Interior' relative to the grid. Can be part of a 'Shape'. Can be 'Visited' or 'Unvisited' during processing.
  - Shape:
      Properties:
        - Type: Implicitly 'Hollow Rectangle' in the initial observation, but potentially any closed loop.
        - Color: Green (3) based on the initial observation.
        - Boundary: Composed of Green pixels.
        - Interior: Contains White (0) pixels initially.

Actions:
  - Identify:
      - Target: Boundary white pixels.
      - Target: Green pixels forming shapes.
      - Target: White pixels enclosed by Green shapes.
  - Traverse:
      - Method: Breadth-First Search (BFS) or similar graph traversal.
      - Start: White pixels on the grid boundary.
      - Condition: Move between adjacent White pixels.
      - Goal: Mark all reachable White pixels from the boundary ('Exterior').
  - Fill:
      - Target: White pixels *not* marked as 'Exterior'.
      - Condition: Pixel is White (0) and was not reached by the boundary traversal.
      - Color: Change target pixel color to Green (3).
  - Copy:
      - Source: Input Grid
      - Destination: Output Grid (initially identical to input)

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally or vertically.
  - Containment: Green shapes enclose regions of White pixels.
  - Connectivity: White pixels can be connected to the grid boundary or isolated within shapes.
