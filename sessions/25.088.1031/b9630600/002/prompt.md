```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

"""
Transformation Rule:
1. Identify all hollow rectangular shapes formed by green (3) pixels on a white (0) background in the input grid.
2. Fill the interior white (0) area enclosed by each green rectangle with green (3) pixels.
3. Pixels originally green and pixels outside any rectangle remain unchanged.

Implementation Strategy:
Use a flood fill (Breadth-First Search - BFS) algorithm starting from the white pixels on the boundary of the grid. 
Any white pixel reachable from the boundary is considered "outside". 
Any white pixel *not* reachable from the boundary must be enclosed within a shape (in this case, the green rectangles). 
These enclosed white pixels are then changed to green.
