Identify all hollow rectangular shapes formed by green (3) pixels on a white (0) background in the input grid.\n2. Fill the interior white (0) area enclosed by each green rectangle with green (3) pixels.\n3. Pixels originally green and pixels outside any rectangle remain unchanged.\n\nImplementation Strategy:\nUse a flood fill (Breadth-First Search - BFS) algorithm starting from the white pixels on the boundary of the grid. \nAny white pixel reachable from the boundary is considered \"outside\". \nAny white pixel *not* reachable from the boundary must be enclosed within a shape (in this case, the green rectangles). \nThese enclosed white pixels are then changed to green.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fills the interior of hollow green rectangles found in the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.ndarray): A 2D NumPy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: A 2D NumPy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n    \n    # Create a visited grid to keep track of reachable white pixels from the boundary\n    visited = np.full((height, width), False, dtype=bool)\n    \n    # Queue for BFS\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Add all white boundary pixels to the queue and mark as visited\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in [0, width - 1]: # Check first and last columns\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                queue.append((r, c))\n    for c in range(1, width - 1): # Check first and last rows (excluding corners already checked)\n         for r in [0, height - 1]:\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                queue.append((r, c))\n\n    # Perform BFS to find all white pixels reachable from the boundary\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check 4 neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            \n            # Check if neighbor is within bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                # If the neighbor is white and hasn't been visited yet\n                if input_grid[nr, nc] == 0 and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                    visited[nr, nc] = True\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    # Iterate through the grid and change unvisited white pixels to green\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # If a pixel is white in the input and was *not* reached by the BFS (i.e., not visited)\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                # It must be inside a green rectangle, so fill it in the output\n                output_grid[r, c] = 3 # Green\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
