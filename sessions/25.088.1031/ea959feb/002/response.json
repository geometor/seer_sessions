            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a repeating background pattern (period H rows, W columns) and restoring pixels obscured by noise (color 1 - blue). The noise pixels are replaced by the most frequent non-noise color found at corresponding positions `(r % H, c % W)` throughout the grid.\n\nThe results show this approach fails on all training examples. Key issues observed:\n1.  **Incorrect Pixel Restoration:** The `Transformed Output` differs significantly from the `Expected Output`, not just in the placement of colors but sometimes in the colors themselves (e.g., Example 3 introducing color 0).\n2.  **Incorrect Pattern Dimensions?** The logic to find the pattern dimensions (H, W) might be flawed, leading to incorrect sampling of reference colors.\n3.  **Incorrect Replacement Logic?** The \"most frequent color\" rule might be insufficient if noise obscures the true pattern color frequently. The fallback behavior (returning 0 when all references are noise) is demonstrably wrong in Example 3.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Verify Pattern Dimensions:** Use `tool_code` to run the `_find_dimension` function on each input example and compare the results (H, W) with the visually apparent periodicity in the `Expected Output`.\n2.  **Analyze Replacement Failures:** For specific noise pixels `(r, c)` that are incorrectly restored, examine the set of non-noise colors found at corresponding pattern positions `(r' % H, c' % W)` in the input. Determine if the \"most frequent\" rule was applied correctly but led to the wrong color, or if the calculated H/W caused sampling from incorrect positions. Analyze the fallback cases (where 0 was outputted).\n3.  **Refine Logic:** Based on the findings, update the `_find_dimension` function if it calculates incorrect H/W, or update the `_get_pattern_color` function (especially the replacement rule and fallback) if H/W are correct but restoration fails. The goal is to accurately deduce the *single* correct color for each pattern position `(pH, pW)` based on the available non-noise data across the grid.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's gather metrics for each example. We need the `_find_dimension` function definition available to the tool.\n"
