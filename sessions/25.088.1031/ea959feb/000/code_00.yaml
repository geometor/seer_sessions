elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      size: 22x25 (consistent across examples)
  - type: pattern
    properties:
      description: A repeating 2D pattern that tiles the grid.
      periodicity: Varies per example (e.g., 6x7, 7x7, 8x4). Defines a basic tile.
      location: Forms the background of the grid.
  - type: noise
    properties:
      description: Contiguous blocks of pixels disrupting the background pattern.
      color: Consistently blue (1) across examples.
      shape: Appears as solid rectangular blocks in the examples provided.
      location: Overlays the background pattern in specific areas of the input grid.
relationship:
  - type: overlay
    subject: noise
    object: pattern
    details: Noise blocks cover parts of the background pattern in the input grid.
action:
  - type: identify
    target: pattern
    details: Determine the repeating tile and its dimensions (H, W) from the uncorrupted parts of the input grid.
  - type: identify
    target: noise
    details: Locate all pixels with the noise color (blue, 1).
  - type: restore
    target: pattern
    details: For each noise pixel at position (row, col), calculate the correct background color using the pattern tile. The correct color is found at position (row % H, col % W) within the base pattern tile.
  - type: replace
    subject: noise pixels
    object: calculated pattern pixels
    details: Replace the blue noise pixels in the input grid with their corresponding restored background pattern pixels to create the output grid.
