This pattern tiles the entire grid. The specific pattern and its repeating unit size vary between examples (e.g., 6x7 in train\\_1, 7x7 in train\\_2, 8x4 in train\\_3).\n3.  **Noise/Corruption:** The input grids contain areas where the background pattern is disrupted. These disruptions appear as contiguous blocks (often rectangular) of a single color, specifically blue (color 1).\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The transformation aims to remove the blue noise blocks and restore the original background pattern in the areas previously occupied by the noise. The output grid is essentially the \"clean\" version of the input grid, with the underlying repeating pattern fully revealed.\n5.  **Restoration Mechanism:** The restoration relies on the periodicity of the background pattern. By identifying the repeating unit (tile) of the pattern and its dimensions (Height x Width), the correct color for any pixel obscured by noise can be determined based on its row and column modulo the pattern's height and width, respectively.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
