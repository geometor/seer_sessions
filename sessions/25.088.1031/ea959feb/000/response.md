Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are large (22x25 pixels).
2.  **Background Pattern:** Both input and output grids exhibit a clear, repeating background pattern. This pattern tiles the entire grid. The specific pattern and its repeating unit size vary between examples (e.g., 6x7 in train\_1, 7x7 in train\_2, 8x4 in train\_3).
3.  **Noise/Corruption:** The input grids contain areas where the background pattern is disrupted. These disruptions appear as contiguous blocks (often rectangular) of a single color, specifically blue (color 1).
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The transformation aims to remove the blue noise blocks and restore the original background pattern in the areas previously occupied by the noise. The output grid is essentially the "clean" version of the input grid, with the underlying repeating pattern fully revealed.
5.  **Restoration Mechanism:** The restoration relies on the periodicity of the background pattern. By identifying the repeating unit (tile) of the pattern and its dimensions (Height x Width), the correct color for any pixel obscured by noise can be determined based on its row and column modulo the pattern's height and width, respectively.

**Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      size: 22x25 (consistent across examples)
  - type: pattern
    properties:
      description: A repeating 2D pattern that tiles the grid.
      periodicity: Varies per example (e.g., 6x7, 7x7, 8x4). Defines a basic tile.
      location: Forms the background of the grid.
  - type: noise
    properties:
      description: Contiguous blocks of pixels disrupting the background pattern.
      color: Consistently blue (1) across examples.
      shape: Appears as solid rectangular blocks in the examples provided.
      location: Overlays the background pattern in specific areas of the input grid.
relationship:
  - type: overlay
    subject: noise
    object: pattern
    details: Noise blocks cover parts of the background pattern in the input grid.
action:
  - type: identify
    target: pattern
    details: Determine the repeating tile and its dimensions (H, W) from the uncorrupted parts of the input grid.
  - type: identify
    target: noise
    details: Locate all pixels with the noise color (blue, 1).
  - type: restore
    target: pattern
    details: For each noise pixel at position (row, col), calculate the correct background color using the pattern tile. The correct color is found at position (row % H, col % W) within the base pattern tile.
  - type: replace
    subject: noise pixels
    object: calculated pattern pixels
    details: Replace the blue noise pixels in the input grid with their corresponding restored background pattern pixels to create the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze the input grid to identify the fundamental repeating background pattern (tile) and its dimensions (Pattern Height H, Pattern Width W).** This can be done by examining areas of the grid unaffected by noise, often starting from the top-left corner, and finding the smallest repeating unit both vertically and horizontally.
2.  **Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.**
3.  **Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid at position (row, column).**
4.  **Check if the color of the current pixel in the input grid is blue (color 1).**
5.  **If the pixel color is blue:**
    a.  **Determine the corresponding position within the fundamental pattern tile:** Calculate `pattern_row = row % H` and `pattern_col = column % W`.
    b.  **Find the color of the pixel at (pattern\_row, pattern\_col) in the fundamental pattern tile.** This is the original color that should be at position (row, column).
    c.  **Update the pixel at (row, column) in the output grid copy with this restored pattern color.**
6.  **If the pixel color is not blue, leave the corresponding pixel in the output grid copy unchanged.**
7.  **After iterating through all pixels, the modified grid copy represents the final output grid.**
