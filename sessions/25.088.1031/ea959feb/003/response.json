Identifying the dimensions (Height H, Width W) of the fundamental repeating \n   pattern tile by analyzing the periodicity of non-noise pixels in the input grid.\n2. Creating a clean output grid, initially identical to the input grid.\n3. Iterating through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.\n4. If the pixel `input_grid[r, c]` contains the noise color (1):\n    a. Determine the corresponding position within the pattern tile: \n       `pattern_row = r % H`, `pattern_col = c % W`.\n    b. Find the most likely original background color for this pattern position \n       `(pattern_row, pattern_col)`. This is done by examining all pixels \n       `input_grid[r', c']` in the grid where `r' % H == pattern_row` and \n       `c' % W == pattern_col`. Collect all colors from these positions that are \n       *not* the noise color. The most frequent color among these collected \n       samples is considered the original background color.\n    c. If no non-noise samples can be found for a specific pattern position \n       (meaning all occurrences of this part of the pattern are obscured by noise), \n       the original noise color (1) is used as a fallback.\n    d. Replace the noise pixel `output_grid[r, c]` with the determined \n       background color (or the fallback noise color).\n5. If the pixel `input_grid[r, c]` is *not* the noise color, it is kept as is \n   in the output grid.\n6. Return the restored output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_dimension(grid, height, width, axis):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the repeating dimension (Height H or Width W) of the background pattern.\n    Compares rows/columns separated by a potential dimension 'dim', ignoring pixels \n    with the noise color, to find the smallest repeating distance that shows \n    a high degree of matching among non-noise pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        height (int): Grid height.\n        width (int): Grid width.\n        axis (int): 0 to find Height (H), 1 to find Width (W).\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The determined dimension (H or W), or the full grid dimension if \n             no repeat is reliably found.\n    \"\"\"\n    noise_color = 1\n    max_dim = height if axis == 0 else width\n\n    # Check dimensions from 1 up to max_dim - 1\n    for dim in range(1, max_dim):\n        if dim == 0: continue # Period must be at least 1\n\n        total_comparisons = 0\n        matches = 0\n\n        # Iterate through all possible starting points for comparison\n        if axis == 0: # Checking rows for Height (H)\n            if dim >= height: continue # Dimension cannot be >= grid height\n            # Compare row r with row r + dim\n            for r in range(height - dim):\n                for c in range(width):\n                    val1 = grid[r, c]\n                    val2 = grid[r + dim, c]\n                    # Compare only if neither is noise\n                    if val1 != noise_color and val2 != noise_color:\n                        total_comparisons += 1\n                        if val1 == val2:\n                            matches += 1\n        else: # Checking columns for Width (W)\n            if dim >= width: continue # Dimension cannot be >= grid width\n            # Compare column c with column c + dim\n            for c in range(width - dim):\n                for r in range(height):\n                    val1 = grid[r, c]\n                    val2 = grid[r, c + dim]\n                    # Compare only if neither is noise\n                    if val1 != noise_color and val2 != noise_color:\n                        total_comparisons += 1\n                        if val1 == val2:\n                            matches += 1\n\n        # Define criteria for accepting a dimension as repeating\n        # Need enough comparisons to be statistically meaningful\n        min_comparisons_threshold = max(5, (height * width * 0.01)) # At least 5, or 1% of grid size\n        # Require a high match rate among the comparable cells\n        match_rate_threshold = 0.95 \n\n        if total_comparisons > min_comparisons_threshold:\n            match_rate = matches / total_comparisons\n            if match_rate >= match_rate_threshold:\n                # Found the smallest dimension that satisfies the criteria\n                return dim \n\n    # Fallback: If no repeating pattern found meeting criteria, assume full dimension\n    return max_dim\n\ndef _get_pattern_color(r_mod, c_mod, H, W, grid, height, width, noise_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the most likely original background color for a given pattern position\n    (specified by row % H and col % W).
