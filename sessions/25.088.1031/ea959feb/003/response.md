"""
The user wants to restore a repeating background pattern in a grid where some 
pixels have been replaced by a 'noise' color (blue, value 1).

The transformation rule involves:
1. Identifying the dimensions (Height H, Width W) of the fundamental repeating 
   pattern tile by analyzing the periodicity of non-noise pixels in the input grid.
2. Creating a clean output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
3. Iterating through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.
4. If the pixel `input_grid[r, c]` contains the noise color (1):
    a. Determine the corresponding position within the pattern tile: 
       `pattern_row = r % H`, `pattern_col = c % W`.
    b. Find the most likely original background color for this pattern position 
       `(pattern_row, pattern_col)`. This is done by examining all pixels 
       `input_grid[r', c']` in the grid where `r' % H == pattern_row` and 
       `c' % W == pattern_col`. Collect all colors from these positions that are 
       *not* the noise color. The most frequent color among these collected 
       samples is considered the original background color.
    c. If no non-noise samples can be found for a specific pattern position 
       (meaning all occurrences of this part of the pattern are obscured by noise), 
       the original noise color (1) is used as a fallback.
    d. Replace the noise pixel `output_grid[r, c]` with the determined 
       background color (or the fallback noise color).
5. If the pixel `input_grid[r, c]` is *not* the noise color, it is kept as is 
   in the output grid.
6. Return the restored output grid.
