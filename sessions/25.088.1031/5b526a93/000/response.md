*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids contain multiple instances of a specific shape (a 3x3 hollow square) made of blue (1) pixels, placed on a white (0) background.
    *   These shapes (objects) are arranged in various horizontal and vertical alignments.
    *   The output grids reproduce the input grid but add new objects.
    *   The new objects have the same shape (3x3 hollow square) but are colored azure (8).
    *   The positions of the new azure objects are related to the positions of the original blue objects.
    *   Specifically, the blue objects located in the leftmost column where any blue object appears act as templates.
    *   These leftmost 'template' objects are replicated horizontally. The replication occurs at the same row level as the template object, but in the columns corresponding to the starting columns of the *other* blue objects present in the input grid.
    *   The original blue objects remain unchanged in the output.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - type: pattern
        color: blue (1)
        shape: 3x3 hollow square (boundary 1s, center 0)
        count: multiple instances per input grid
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
      - type: generated_object
        color: azure (8)
        shape: identical to the blue pattern object
        origin: replicated from specific blue objects
        
    relationships:

        input: coordinates of pattern objects
        output: set of unique starting column indices

        output: set of unique starting row indices
      - action: identify_source_objects
        input: pattern objects, minimum starting column index
        output: list of pattern objects located at the minimum starting column index
      - action: replicate_and_recolor
        input: source objects, set of other starting column indices
        output: new azure (8) objects placed at the source object's row and the other column indices
      - action: combine
        input: input grid, new azure objects
        output: output grid containing original objects plus the new azure objects

    transformation:
      rule: Replicate the leftmost blue pattern objects horizontally to other column alignments found in the grid, changing their color to azure.
      condition: Replication applies only to objects starting in the minimum column index occupied by any pattern object.
      color_change: blue (1) -> azure (8) for replicated objects.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all occurrences of the repeating blue (1) object pattern (a 3x3 square frame) in the input grid. Record their top-left corner coordinates.
    2.  Determine the set of unique starting column indices for these blue objects.
    3.  Find the minimum starting column index among them.
    4.  Identify all blue objects whose top-left corner is located at this minimum column index. These are the "source" objects.
    5.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    6.  For each "source" object found in step 4, located at `(row, min_col)`:
        a.  Iterate through all unique starting column indices identified in step 2, excluding the `min_col` itself. Let each such index be `other_col`.
        b.  Copy the 3x3 pattern of the source object.
        c.  Place this copied pattern onto the output grid, starting at position `(row, other_col)`.
        d.  Change the color of the pixels in the copied pattern from blue (1) to azure (8).
    7.  Return the modified output grid.
