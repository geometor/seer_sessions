One is located in column 1 and rows 1 and 2, and consists in two azure cells vertically. The other is located in row 4 and columns 4 and 5, and consists in two horizontally placed azure cells.\n3.  **Change**: The cells that:\n    +   have a direct neighbor to the left of color 8.\n    +   have a direct neighbor to the right of color 8.\n\n    are changed to the color blue (1).\n\n**Transformation Rule**\nThe transformation rule can be described as background. For each cell, If a cell, that is not part of a azure rectangle, is between two azure colored cells (neighbor to the left is azure and neighbor to the right is azure), change the cells to blue (1).\n\n"
