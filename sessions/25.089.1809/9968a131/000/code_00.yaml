Examples:
  - Input:
      Grid: [[7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 8, 3, 7], [7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 8, 3, 7]]
      Colors: [Orange, Green, Azure]
    Output:
      Grid: [[7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 7, 8, 3], [7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 7, 8, 3]]
    Transformation:
      Scope: Row-based, affects specific 3-pixel sequences.
      Identified_Sequence_Input: [8, 3, 7] (Azure, Green, Orange)
      Identified_Sequence_Output: [7, 8, 3] (Orange, Azure, Green)
      Action: Replace all non-overlapping occurrences of [8, 3, 7] with [7, 8, 3] horizontally within each row.
      Relationship: Output sequence is a right cyclic shift of the input sequence.

  - Input:
      Grid: [[0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]]
      Colors: [White, Gray, Orange]
    Output:
      Grid: [[0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7], [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7], [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]]
    Transformation:
      Scope: Row-based, affects specific 3-pixel sequences.
      Identified_Sequence_Input: [5, 0, 7] (Gray, White, Orange)
      Identified_Sequence_Output: [7, 5, 0] (Orange, Gray, White)
      Action: Replace all non-overlapping occurrences of [5, 0, 7] with [7, 5, 0] horizontally within each row.
      Relationship: Output sequence is a right cyclic shift of the input sequence.

General Observations:
  Grid_Properties:
    - Input and Output grids have the same dimensions.
    - Color palettes are preserved.
  Transformation_Rule:
    - A specific 3-pixel horizontal sequence (A, B, C) is identified from the input-output example comparison.
    - This sequence is consistently replaced by its right cyclic shift (C, A, B).
    - The replacement occurs row by row, scanning from left to right.
    - Replacements target non-overlapping occurrences of the sequence (A, B, C).
    - Pixels not part of the identified sequence (A, B, C) remain unchanged.
