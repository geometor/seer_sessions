            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples involve transforming a rectangular grid of colored pixels into another grid of the same dimensions.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The colors present in the input seem to be preserved in the output, just potentially rearranged.\n    *   Example 1: Orange (7), Green (3), Azure (8)\n    *   Example 2: White (0), Gray (5), Orange (7)\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The changes seem localized within specific rows. Comparing input and output row by row reveals that certain horizontal sequences of three pixels are altered.\n    *   In Example 1, the sequence `8 3 7` (Azure, Green, Orange) in the input rows becomes `7 8 3` (Orange, Azure, Green) in the output rows. This transformation occurs wherever the sequence `8 3 7` is found.\n    *   In Example 2, the sequence `5 0 7` (Gray, White, Orange) in the input rows becomes `7 5 0` (Orange, Gray, White) in the output rows. This transformation occurs wherever the sequence `5 0 7` is found.\n4.  **Rule Generalization:** The core operation appears to be identifying a specific 3-pixel horizontal sequence (let's call the pixels A, B, C) within the input and replacing it with a cyclically shifted version where the last pixel becomes the first (C, A, B). This specific sequence (`ABC`) seems constant for a given task instance (determined by the example pair) and the transformation (`ABC` -> `CAB`) is applied uniformly wherever `ABC` occurs horizontally. Pixels not part of this specific sequence remain unchanged. The replacement seems to happen for non-overlapping instances found when scanning left-to-right within each row.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Find the first instance where a 3-pixel horizontal sequence in the input, let's call it `ABC` (composed of pixel values A, B, and C), differs from the corresponding 3-pixel sequence in the output. Confirm that the output sequence is `CAB` (the right cyclic shift of `ABC`). This pair (`ABC` -> `CAB`) defines the transformation rule for this task.\n2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid that is an exact copy of the input grid.\n3.  **Scan and Replace:** Iterate through each row of the input grid from top to bottom. Within each row, scan from left to right using a column index.\n4.  **Match Sequence:** At each position, check if the next three pixels horizontally match the sequence `ABC` identified in step 1.\n5.  **Apply Transformation:** If the sequence `ABC` is found starting at the current column index:\n    a.  Replace the corresponding three pixels in the *output grid* copy with the sequence `CAB`.\n    b.  Advance the column index by 3 to look for the *next* potential non-overlapping match in the same row.\n6.  **Advance Scan:** If the sequence `ABC` is *not* found starting at the current column index, advance the column index by 1.\n7.  **Repeat:** Continue scanning and replacing within the row until the end of the row is reached (where a 3-pixel sequence can no longer fit). Proceed to the next row and repeat steps 3-6.\n8.  **Finalize:** Once all rows have been processed, the modified grid copy is the final output."
