Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples involve transforming a rectangular grid of colored pixels into another grid of the same dimensions.
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors present in the input seem to be preserved in the output, just potentially rearranged.
    *   Example 1: Orange (7), Green (3), Azure (8)
    *   Example 2: White (0), Gray (5), Orange (7)
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The changes seem localized within specific rows. Comparing input and output row by row reveals that certain horizontal sequences of three pixels are altered.
    *   In Example 1, the sequence `8 3 7` (Azure, Green, Orange) in the input rows becomes `7 8 3` (Orange, Azure, Green) in the output rows. This transformation occurs wherever the sequence `8 3 7` is found.
    *   In Example 2, the sequence `5 0 7` (Gray, White, Orange) in the input rows becomes `7 5 0` (Orange, Gray, White) in the output rows. This transformation occurs wherever the sequence `5 0 7` is found.
4.  **Rule Generalization:** The core operation appears to be identifying a specific 3-pixel horizontal sequence (let's call the pixels A, B, C) within the input and replacing it with a cyclically shifted version where the last pixel becomes the first (C, A, B). This specific sequence (`ABC`) seems constant for a given task instance (determined by the example pair) and the transformation (`ABC` -> `CAB`) is applied uniformly wherever `ABC` occurs horizontally. Pixels not part of this specific sequence remain unchanged. The replacement seems to happen for non-overlapping instances found when scanning left-to-right within each row.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Examples:
  - Input:
      Grid: [[7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 8, 3, 7], [7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 8, 3, 7]]
      Colors: [Orange, Green, Azure]
    Output:
      Grid: [[7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 7, 8, 3], [7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 7, 8, 3]]
    Transformation:
      Scope: Row-based, affects specific 3-pixel sequences.
      Identified_Sequence_Input: [8, 3, 7] (Azure, Green, Orange)
      Identified_Sequence_Output: [7, 8, 3] (Orange, Azure, Green)
      Action: Replace all non-overlapping occurrences of [8, 3, 7] with [7, 8, 3] horizontally within each row.
      Relationship: Output sequence is a right cyclic shift of the input sequence.

  - Input:
      Grid: [[0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]]
      Colors: [White, Gray, Orange]
    Output:
      Grid: [[0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7], [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7], [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]]
    Transformation:
      Scope: Row-based, affects specific 3-pixel sequences.
      Identified_Sequence_Input: [5, 0, 7] (Gray, White, Orange)
      Identified_Sequence_Output: [7, 5, 0] (Orange, Gray, White)
      Action: Replace all non-overlapping occurrences of [5, 0, 7] with [7, 5, 0] horizontally within each row.
      Relationship: Output sequence is a right cyclic shift of the input sequence.

General Observations:
  Grid_Properties:
    - Input and Output grids have the same dimensions.
    - Color palettes are preserved.
  Transformation_Rule:
    - A specific 3-pixel horizontal sequence (A, B, C) is identified from the input-output example comparison.
    - This sequence is consistently replaced by its right cyclic shift (C, A, B).
    - The replacement occurs row by row, scanning from left to right.
    - Replacements target non-overlapping occurrences of the sequence (A, B, C).
    - Pixels not part of the identified sequence (A, B, C) remain unchanged.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Transformation:** Examine the provided input and output training example grids. Find the first instance where a 3-pixel horizontal sequence in the input, let's call it `ABC` (composed of pixel values A, B, and C), differs from the corresponding 3-pixel sequence in the output. Confirm that the output sequence is `CAB` (the right cyclic shift of `ABC`). This pair (`ABC` -> `CAB`) defines the transformation rule for this task.
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid that is an exact copy of the input grid.
3.  **Scan and Replace:** Iterate through each row of the input grid from top to bottom. Within each row, scan from left to right using a column index.
4.  **Match Sequence:** At each position, check if the next three pixels horizontally match the sequence `ABC` identified in step 1.
5.  **Apply Transformation:** If the sequence `ABC` is found starting at the current column index:
    a.  Replace the corresponding three pixels in the *output grid* copy with the sequence `CAB`.
    b.  Advance the column index by 3 to look for the *next* potential non-overlapping match in the same row.
6.  **Advance Scan:** If the sequence `ABC` is *not* found starting at the current column index, advance the column index by 1.
7.  **Repeat:** Continue scanning and replacing within the row until the end of the row is reached (where a 3-pixel sequence can no longer fit). Proceed to the next row and repeat steps 3-6.
8.  **Finalize:** Once all rows have been processed, the modified grid copy is the final output.
