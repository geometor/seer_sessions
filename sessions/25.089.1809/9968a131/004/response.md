**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation mechanism: finding a specific 3-pixel horizontal sequence (`ABC`) and replacing it with its right cyclic shift (`CAB`). The execution results reveal the critical flaw in the initial approach: the assumption that the *specific* sequence (`ABC`) identified in `train_1` would be the *same* sequence used for `train_2`. The results clearly show `train_2` involves a *different* 3-pixel sequence (`[5, 0, 7]`) undergoing the same *type* of transformation (right cyclic shift to `[7, 5, 0]`).

Therefore, the transformation rule is not fixed for the entire task but is *derived* from the specific input/output pair presented. The natural language program needs modification to reflect that the identification of the `ABC` sequence is the first step performed *on the provided example pair* before applying the transformation.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  Update the Natural Language Program to explicitly state that the `ABC -> CAB` rule's specific pixel values (`A`, `B`, `C`) must be determined by comparing the *given* input and output grids for that particular example or test case.
2.  Refine the description of the `find_transformation_rule` step to emphasize it operates on the *specific pair* being analyzed.
3.  The overall application logic (copy grid, scan rows, replace non-overlapping `ABC` with `CAB`, advance scanner) remains valid but must use the `ABC` and `CAB` sequences derived specifically for that instance.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task_Type: Pattern Replacement
Grid_Properties:
  - Input and Output grids always have the same dimensions.
  - The color palette is preserved between input and output.
Object_Focus: Horizontal 3-pixel sequences.
Transformation:
  Type: Substitution based on a derived rule.
  Rule_Derivation:
    - For each input/output example pair, identify the *first* horizontal 3-pixel sequence (A, B, C) in the input that differs from the corresponding sequence in the output.
    - Verify that the output sequence is the right cyclic shift of the input sequence: (C, A, B).
    - This pair of sequences, Input:(A, B, C) -> Output:(C, A, B), constitutes the transformation rule *specific to that example pair*.
  Rule_Application:
    - Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    - Scan the row from left to right.
    - Identify all *non-overlapping* occurrences of the derived Input Sequence (A, B, C).
    - Replace each identified occurrence in the corresponding position in the output grid with the derived Output Sequence (C, A, B).
    - Pixels not part of any replaced sequence remain unchanged.
Example_Specific_Rules:
  - Example 1: Input:(8, 3, 7) -> Output:(7, 8, 3). Found 2 occurrences. 6 pixels changed.
  - Example 2: Input:(5, 0, 7) -> Output:(7, 5, 0). Found 3 occurrences. 9 pixels changed.
Consistency_Check: The number of pixels changed in each example is exactly 3 times the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the specific input sequence identified for that example.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Task-Specific Transformation Rule:**
    *   Take the *single* provided input grid and its corresponding *single* output grid (the training example pair for the current task instance).
    *   Compare the input and output grids row by row, column by column, looking for the *first* instance where a horizontal sequence of three pixels in the input, let's call it `ABC` (values A, B, C), is different from the sequence at the same location in the output.
    *   Confirm that the differing sequence in the output is `CAB` (the right cyclic shift of `ABC`, where C moves to the first position).
    *   Store `ABC` as the "sequence to find" and `CAB` as the "replacement sequence". This pair is the rule for *this specific task instance*. If no such `ABC -> CAB` pattern is found, the transformation rule cannot be determined.
2.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid as an identical copy of the input grid that needs to be transformed (this could be one of the training inputs for verification, or the final test input).
3.  **Scan Rows and Apply Rule:**
    *   Iterate through each row of the *original* input grid from top to bottom.
    *   For each row, scan from left to right using a column index, ensuring there are at least 3 pixels remaining from the current index to the end of the row.
4.  **Match and Replace:**
    *   At the current column index, check if the three pixels `(input[row][col], input[row][col+1], input[row][col+2])` exactly match the "sequence to find" (`ABC`) identified in Step 1.
    *   If they match:
        *   Replace the pixels at `(row, col)`, `(row, col+1)`, and `(row, col+2)` in the *output grid copy* with the "replacement sequence" (`CAB`).
        *   Advance the column index by 3 (to ensure non-overlapping replacements).
    *   If they do not match:
        *   Advance the column index by 1.
5.  **Continue Scan:** Repeat Step 4 until the scan reaches a point where fewer than 3 pixels are left in the row.
6.  **Proceed to Next Row:** Repeat Steps 3-5 for all rows.
7.  **Final Output:** The modified output grid copy is the result of the transformation.
