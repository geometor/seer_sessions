            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation mechanism: finding a specific 3-pixel horizontal sequence (`ABC`) and replacing it with its right cyclic shift (`CAB`). The execution results reveal the critical flaw in the initial approach: the assumption that the *specific* sequence (`ABC`) identified in `train_1` would be the *same* sequence used for `train_2`. The results clearly show `train_2` involves a *different* 3-pixel sequence (`[5, 0, 7]`) undergoing the same *type* of transformation (right cyclic shift to `[7, 5, 0]`).\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule is not fixed for the entire task but is *derived* from the specific input/output pair presented. The natural language program needs modification to reflect that the identification of the `ABC` sequence is the first step performed *on the provided example pair* before applying the transformation.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Update the Natural Language Program to explicitly state that the `ABC -> CAB` rule's specific pixel values (`A`, `B`, `C`) must be determined by comparing the *given* input and output grids for that particular example or test case.\n2.  Refine the description of the `find_transformation_rule` step to emphasize it operates on the *specific pair* being analyzed.\n3.  The overall application logic (copy grid, scan rows, replace non-overlapping `ABC` with `CAB`, advance scanner) remains valid but must use the `ABC` and `CAB` sequences derived specifically for that instance.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
