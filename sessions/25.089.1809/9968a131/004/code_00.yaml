Task_Type: Pattern Replacement
Grid_Properties:
  - Input and Output grids always have the same dimensions.
  - The color palette is preserved between input and output.
Object_Focus: Horizontal 3-pixel sequences.
Transformation:
  Type: Substitution based on a derived rule.
  Rule_Derivation:
    - For each input/output example pair, identify the *first* horizontal 3-pixel sequence (A, B, C) in the input that differs from the corresponding sequence in the output.
    - Verify that the output sequence is the right cyclic shift of the input sequence: (C, A, B).
    - This pair of sequences, Input:(A, B, C) -> Output:(C, A, B), constitutes the transformation rule *specific to that example pair*.
  Rule_Application:
    - Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    - Scan the row from left to right.
    - Identify all *non-overlapping* occurrences of the derived Input Sequence (A, B, C).
    - Replace each identified occurrence in the corresponding position in the output grid with the derived Output Sequence (C, A, B).
    - Pixels not part of any replaced sequence remain unchanged.
Example_Specific_Rules:
  - Example 1: Input:(8, 3, 7) -> Output:(7, 8, 3). Found 2 occurrences. 6 pixels changed.
  - Example 2: Input:(5, 0, 7) -> Output:(7, 5, 0). Found 3 occurrences. 9 pixels changed.
Consistency_Check: The number of pixels changed in each example is exactly 3 times the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the specific input sequence identified for that example.
