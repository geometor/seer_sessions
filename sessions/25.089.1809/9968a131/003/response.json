Find the first such occurrence. This (ABC -> CAB) pair defines the transformation rule for the task.\n2.  **Rule Application:** For a given test input grid:\n    a. Create a copy of the test input grid.\n    b. Iterate through each row of the original test input grid.\n    c. Scan each row from left to right, checking for non-overlapping occurrences of the identified input sequence (ABC).\n    d. When an occurrence of ABC is found starting at a certain position, replace the corresponding three pixels in the copied grid with the identified output sequence (CAB).\n    e. Advance the scan position by 3 after a replacement, or by 1 if no match was found at the current position.\n    f. Pixels not part of a replaced sequence remain unchanged in the copied grid.\n3.  **Output:** Return the modified copied grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_transformation_rule(train_input: np.ndarray, train_output: np.ndarray) -> Optional[Tuple[Tuple[int, ...], Tuple[int, ...]]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first differing 3-element horizontal sequence and its transformed version.\n    Assumes the transformation is a right cyclic shift (ABC -> CAB).\n\n    Args:\n        train_input: The input grid from the training example (numpy array).\n        train_output: The output grid from the training example (numpy array).\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing (input_sequence_ABC, output_sequence_CAB), or None if no such rule is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = train_input.shape\n    if width < 3:\n        # Cannot find a 3-element sequence if width is less than 3\n        return None\n\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width - 2):\n            input_seq = tuple(train_input[r, c:c+3])\n            output_seq = tuple(train_output[r, c:c+3])\n\n            # Check if sequences differ\n            if input_seq != output_seq:\n                # Verify if it's the specific cyclic shift ABC -> CAB\n                # expected_output_seq = (input_seq[-1],) + input_seq[:-1] # Left shift\n                expected_output_seq = (input_seq[2], input_seq[0], input_seq[1]) # Right shift CAB\n\n                if output_seq == expected_output_seq:\n                    # Found the rule\n                    return input_seq, output_seq\n                else:\n                    # Found a difference, but it doesn't match the expected cyclic shift pattern.\n                    # This might indicate a different rule or noise.\n                    # Continue searching for the *first* match that fits the pattern.\n                    pass\n\n    # No matching transformation rule found in the examples\n    return None\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the learned transformation rule (replace ABC with CAB) to the input grid.\n    The rule (ABC -> CAB) is determined by analyzing the first training example.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_arr = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_arr = np.copy(input_arr) # Initialize output_grid as a copy\n    height, width = input_arr.shape\n\n    # --- Determine the Rule using the First Training Example ---\n    # In a real ARC scenario, the training examples are provided alongside the test input.\n    # We simulate this by defining the first training pair here.\n    train1_in_data = [[7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 8, 3, 7], [7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 8, 3, 7]]\n    train1_out_data = [[7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 7, 8, 3], [7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 7, 8, 3]]\n    train1_in_arr = np.array(train1_in_data, dtype=int)\n    train1_out_arr = np.array(train1_out_data, dtype=int)\n\n    transformation_rule = find_transformation_rule(train1_in_arr, train1_out_arr)\n\n    # If no rule was found, return the original grid\n    if transformation_rule is None:\n        # print(\"Warning: No suitable transformation rule (ABC -> CAB) found in the reference training example.
