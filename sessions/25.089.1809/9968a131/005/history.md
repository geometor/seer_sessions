Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples involve transforming a rectangular grid of colored pixels into another grid of the same dimensions.
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors present in the input seem to be preserved in the output, just potentially rearranged.
    *   Example 1: Orange (7), Green (3), Azure (8)
    *   Example 2: White (0), Gray (5), Orange (7)
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The changes seem localized within specific rows. Comparing input and output row by row reveals that certain horizontal sequences of three pixels are altered.
    *   In Example 1, the sequence `8 3 7` (Azure, Green, Orange) in the input rows becomes `7 8 3` (Orange, Azure, Green) in the output rows. This transformation occurs wherever the sequence `8 3 7` is found.
    *   In Example 2, the sequence `5 0 7` (Gray, White, Orange) in the input rows becomes `7 5 0` (Orange, Gray, White) in the output rows. This transformation occurs wherever the sequence `5 0 7` is found.
4.  **Rule Generalization:** The core operation appears to be identifying a specific 3-pixel horizontal sequence (let's call the pixels A, B, C) within the input and replacing it with a cyclically shifted version where the last pixel becomes the first (C, A, B). This specific sequence (`ABC`) seems constant for a given task instance (determined by the example pair) and the transformation (`ABC` -> `CAB`) is applied uniformly wherever `ABC` occurs horizontally. Pixels not part of this specific sequence remain unchanged. The replacement seems to happen for non-overlapping instances found when scanning left-to-right within each row.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Examples:
  - Input:
      Grid: [[7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 8, 3, 7], [7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 8, 3, 7]]
      Colors: [Orange, Green, Azure]
    Output:
      Grid: [[7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 7, 8, 3], [7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 7, 8, 3]]
    Transformation:
      Scope: Row-based, affects specific 3-pixel sequences.
      Identified_Sequence_Input: [8, 3, 7] (Azure, Green, Orange)
      Identified_Sequence_Output: [7, 8, 3] (Orange, Azure, Green)
      Action: Replace all non-overlapping occurrences of [8, 3, 7] with [7, 8, 3] horizontally within each row.
      Relationship: Output sequence is a right cyclic shift of the input sequence.

  - Input:
      Grid: [[0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]]
      Colors: [White, Gray, Orange]
    Output:
      Grid: [[0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7], [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7], [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]]
    Transformation:
      Scope: Row-based, affects specific 3-pixel sequences.
      Identified_Sequence_Input: [5, 0, 7] (Gray, White, Orange)
      Identified_Sequence_Output: [7, 5, 0] (Orange, Gray, White)
      Action: Replace all non-overlapping occurrences of [5, 0, 7] with [7, 5, 0] horizontally within each row.
      Relationship: Output sequence is a right cyclic shift of the input sequence.

General Observations:
  Grid_Properties:
    - Input and Output grids have the same dimensions.
    - Color palettes are preserved.
  Transformation_Rule:
    - A specific 3-pixel horizontal sequence (A, B, C) is identified from the input-output example comparison.
    - This sequence is consistently replaced by its right cyclic shift (C, A, B).
    - The replacement occurs row by row, scanning from left to right.
    - Replacements target non-overlapping occurrences of the sequence (A, B, C).
    - Pixels not part of the identified sequence (A, B, C) remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Transformation:** Examine the provided input and output training example grids. Find the first instance where a 3-pixel horizontal sequence in the input, let's call it `ABC` (composed of pixel values A, B, and C), differs from the corresponding 3-pixel sequence in the output. Confirm that the output sequence is `CAB` (the right cyclic shift of `ABC`). This pair (`ABC` -> `CAB`) defines the transformation rule for this task.
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid that is an exact copy of the input grid.
3.  **Scan and Replace:** Iterate through each row of the input grid from top to bottom. Within each row, scan from left to right using a column index.
4.  **Match Sequence:** At each position, check if the next three pixels horizontally match the sequence `ABC` identified in step 1.
5.  **Apply Transformation:** If the sequence `ABC` is found starting at the current column index:
    a.  Replace the corresponding three pixels in the *output grid* copy with the sequence `CAB`.
    b.  Advance the column index by 3 to look for the *next* potential non-overlapping match in the same row.
6.  **Advance Scan:** If the sequence `ABC` is *not* found starting at the current column index, advance the column index by 1.
7.  **Repeat:** Continue scanning and replacing within the row until the end of the row is reached (where a 3-pixel sequence can no longer fit). Proceed to the next row and repeat steps 3-6.
8.  **Finalize:** Once all rows have been processed, the modified grid copy is the final output.
```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple

"""
Identifies a specific 3-pixel horizontal sequence (A, B, C) that differs between the input and output in the training examples. 
The transformation rule observed is that this sequence ABC is replaced by its right cyclic shift CAB (where C becomes the first element).
This replacement is applied to all non-overlapping occurrences of the sequence ABC found when scanning each row of the input grid from left to right. 
Pixels not part of this specific sequence remain unchanged.

For example, if the identified rule from training is [8, 3, 7] -> [7, 8, 3]:
Input row:  [7, 8, 3, 7, 1, 8, 3, 7]
Output row: [7, 7, 8, 3, 1, 7, 8, 3] 
(The first [8, 3, 7] is replaced, the scanner advances 3 steps, then the second [8, 3, 7] is found and replaced).

Note: The specific sequence (ABC) and its transformation (CAB) must be determined by analyzing the training examples *before* running this transform function on a test input. This implementation requires the specific sequences to be known beforehand.

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation mechanism: finding a specific 3-pixel horizontal sequence (`ABC`) and replacing it with its right cyclic shift (`CAB`). The execution results reveal the critical flaw in the initial approach: the assumption that the *specific* sequence (`ABC`) identified in `train_1` would be the *same* sequence used for `train_2`. The results clearly show `train_2` involves a *different* 3-pixel sequence (`[5, 0, 7]`) undergoing the same *type* of transformation (right cyclic shift to `[7, 5, 0]`).

Therefore, the transformation rule is not fixed for the entire task but is *derived* from the specific input/output pair presented. The natural language program needs modification to reflect that the identification of the `ABC` sequence is the first step performed *on the provided example pair* before applying the transformation.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  Update the Natural Language Program to explicitly state that the `ABC -> CAB` rule's specific pixel values (`A`, `B`, `C`) must be determined by comparing the *given* input and output grids for that particular example or test case.
2.  Refine the description of the `find_transformation_rule` step to emphasize it operates on the *specific pair* being analyzed.
3.  The overall application logic (copy grid, scan rows, replace non-overlapping `ABC` with `CAB`, advance scanner) remains valid but must use the `ABC` and `CAB` sequences derived specifically for that instance.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task_Type: Pattern Replacement
Grid_Properties:
  - Input and Output grids always have the same dimensions.
  - The color palette is preserved between input and output.
Object_Focus: Horizontal 3-pixel sequences.
Transformation:
  Type: Substitution based on a derived rule.
  Rule_Derivation:
    - For each input/output example pair, identify the *first* horizontal 3-pixel sequence (A, B, C) in the input that differs from the corresponding sequence in the output.
    - Verify that the output sequence is the right cyclic shift of the input sequence: (C, A, B).
    - This pair of sequences, Input:(A, B, C) -> Output:(C, A, B), constitutes the transformation rule *specific to that example pair*.
  Rule_Application:
    - Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    - Scan the row from left to right.
    - Identify all *non-overlapping* occurrences of the derived Input Sequence (A, B, C).
    - Replace each identified occurrence in the corresponding position in the output grid with the derived Output Sequence (C, A, B).
    - Pixels not part of any replaced sequence remain unchanged.
Example_Specific_Rules:
  - Example 1: Input:(8, 3, 7) -> Output:(7, 8, 3). Found 2 occurrences. 6 pixels changed.
  - Example 2: Input:(5, 0, 7) -> Output:(7, 5, 0). Found 3 occurrences. 9 pixels changed.
Consistency_Check: The number of pixels changed in each example is exactly 3 times the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the specific input sequence identified for that example.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Task-Specific Transformation Rule:**
    *   Take the *single* provided input grid and its corresponding *single* output grid (the training example pair for the current task instance).
    *   Compare the input and output grids row by row, column by column, looking for the *first* instance where a horizontal sequence of three pixels in the input, let's call it `ABC` (values A, B, C), is different from the sequence at the same location in the output.
    *   Confirm that the differing sequence in the output is `CAB` (the right cyclic shift of `ABC`, where C moves to the first position).
    *   Store `ABC` as the "sequence to find" and `CAB` as the "replacement sequence". This pair is the rule for *this specific task instance*. If no such `ABC -> CAB` pattern is found, the transformation rule cannot be determined.
2.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid as an identical copy of the input grid that needs to be transformed (this could be one of the training inputs for verification, or the final test input).
3.  **Scan Rows and Apply Rule:**
    *   Iterate through each row of the *original* input grid from top to bottom.
    *   For each row, scan from left to right using a column index, ensuring there are at least 3 pixels remaining from the current index to the end of the row.
4.  **Match and Replace:**
    *   At the current column index, check if the three pixels `(input[row][col], input[row][col+1], input[row][col+2])` exactly match the "sequence to find" (`ABC`) identified in Step 1.
    *   If they match:
        *   Replace the pixels at `(row, col)`, `(row, col+1)`, and `(row, col+2)` in the *output grid copy* with the "replacement sequence" (`CAB`).
        *   Advance the column index by 3 (to ensure non-overlapping replacements).
    *   If they do not match:
        *   Advance the column index by 1.
5.  **Continue Scan:** Repeat Step 4 until the scan reaches a point where fewer than 3 pixels are left in the row.
6.  **Proceed to Next Row:** Repeat Steps 3-5 for all rows.
7.  **Final Output:** The modified output grid copy is the result of the transformation.
