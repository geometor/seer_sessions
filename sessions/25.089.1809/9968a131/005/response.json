This pair is the rule for *this specific task instance*. If no such `ABC -> CAB` pattern is found, the transformation rule cannot be determined.\n2.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid as an identical copy of the input grid that needs to be transformed (this could be one of the training inputs for verification, or the final test input).\n3.  **Scan Rows and Apply Rule:**\n    *   Iterate through each row of the *original* input grid from top to bottom.\n    *   For each row, scan from left to right using a column index, ensuring there are at least 3 pixels remaining from the current index to the end of the row.\n4.  **Match and Replace:**\n    *   At the current column index, check if the three pixels `(input[row][col], input[row][col+1], input[row][col+2])` exactly match the \"sequence to find\" (`ABC`) identified in Step 1.\n    *   If they match:\n        *   Replace the pixels at `(row, col)`, `(row, col+1)`, and `(row, col+2)` in the *output grid copy* with the \"replacement sequence\" (`CAB`).\n        *   Advance the column index by 3 (to ensure non-overlapping replacements).\n    *   If they do not match:\n        *   Advance the column index by 1.\n5.  **Continue Scan:** Repeat Step 4 until the scan reaches a point where fewer than 3 pixels are left in the row.\n6.  **Proceed to Next Row:** Repeat Steps 3-5 for all rows.\n7.  **Final Output:** The modified output grid copy is the result of the transformation.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes access to the *first* training example pair to derive the rule, as the rule itself is specific to the task instance defined by that pair.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_transformation_rule(train_input: np.ndarray, train_output: np.ndarray) -> Optional[Tuple[Tuple[int, ...], Tuple[int, ...]]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Helper function to find the specific (ABC -> CAB) rule from a training pair.\n\n    Args:\n        train_input: The input grid from the training example (numpy array).\n        train_output: The output grid from the training example (numpy array).\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing (input_sequence_ABC, output_sequence_CAB), or None if no such rule is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = train_input.shape\n    if width < 3:\n        return None # Cannot find a 3-element sequence\n\n    # Step 1: Identify the Task-Specific Transformation Rule\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width - 2):\n            input_seq = tuple(train_input[r, c:c+3])\n            output_seq = tuple(train_output[r, c:c+3])\n\n            if input_seq != output_seq:\n                # Check if it's the right cyclic shift: ABC -> CAB\n                expected_output_seq = (input_seq[2], input_seq[0], input_seq[1])\n                if output_seq == expected_output_seq:\n                    # Found the rule\n                    return input_seq, output_seq\n                else:\n                    # A difference was found, but not the expected pattern.\n                    # Continue searching for the first valid instance.\n                    pass\n\n    # No matching transformation rule found\n    return None\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the learned transformation rule (replace ABC with CAB) to the input grid.\n    The rule is derived by analyzing the first training example associated with the task.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_arr = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_arr.shape\n\n    # --- Determine the Rule using the First Training Example ---\n    # This section simulates accessing the first training pair for the specific task instance.\n    # In a real ARC environment, this data would likely be passed alongside the test input.\n    # Hardcoding the first example from the prompt:\n    train1_in_data = [[7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 8, 3, 7], [7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 8, 3, 7]]\n    train1_out_data = [[7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 7, 8, 3], [7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 7, 8, 3]]\n    train1_in_arr = np.array(train1_in_data, dtype=int)\n    train1_out_arr = np.array(train1_out_data, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Call the helper function to find the rule (Step 1 of NLP)\n    transformation_rule = _find_transformation_rule(train1_in_arr, train1_out_arr)\n\n    # If no rule could be determined, return the input grid unchanged.\n    if transformation_rule is None:\n        # print(\"Warning: No suitable transformation rule (ABC -> CAB) found in the reference training example.
