Transformation Rule Description:

1.  **Identify the Task-Specific Transformation Rule:**
    *   Take the *single* provided input grid and its corresponding *single* output grid (the training example pair for the current task instance).
    *   Compare the input and output grids row by row, column by column, looking for the *first* instance where a horizontal sequence of three pixels in the input, let's call it `ABC` (values A, B, C), is different from the sequence at the same location in the output.
    *   Confirm that the differing sequence in the output is `CAB` (the right cyclic shift of `ABC`, where C moves to the first position).
    *   Store `ABC` as the "sequence to find" and `CAB` as the "replacement sequence". This pair is the rule for *this specific task instance*. If no such `ABC -> CAB` pattern is found, the transformation rule cannot be determined.
2.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid as an identical copy of the input grid that needs to be transformed (this could be one of the training inputs for verification, or the final test input).
3.  **Scan Rows and Apply Rule:**
    *   Iterate through each row of the *original* input grid from top to bottom.
    *   For each row, scan from left to right using a column index, ensuring there are at least 3 pixels remaining from the current index to the end of the row.
4.  **Match and Replace:**
    *   At the current column index, check if the three pixels `(input[row][col], input[row][col+1], input[row][col+2])` exactly match the "sequence to find" (`ABC`) identified in Step 1.
    *   If they match:
        *   Replace the pixels at `(row, col)`, `(row, col+1)`, and `(row, col+2)` in the *output grid copy* with the "replacement sequence" (`CAB`).
        *   Advance the column index by 3 (to ensure non-overlapping replacements).
    *   If they do not match:
        *   Advance the column index by 1.
5.  **Continue Scan:** Repeat Step 4 until the scan reaches a point where fewer than 3 pixels are left in the row.
6.  **Proceed to Next Row:** Repeat Steps 3-5 for all rows.
7.  **Final Output:** The modified output grid copy is the result of the transformation.

Note: This implementation assumes access to the *first* training example pair to derive the rule, as the rule itself is specific to the task instance defined by that pair.
