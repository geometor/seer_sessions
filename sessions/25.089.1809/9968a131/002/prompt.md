Previous Code:
```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple

"""
Identifies a specific 3-pixel horizontal sequence (A, B, C) that differs between the input and output in the training examples. 
The transformation rule observed is that this sequence ABC is replaced by its right cyclic shift CAB (where C becomes the first element).
This replacement is applied to all non-overlapping occurrences of the sequence ABC found when scanning each row of the input grid from left to right. 
Pixels not part of this specific sequence remain unchanged.

For example, if the identified rule from training is [8, 3, 7] -> [7, 8, 3]:
Input row:  [7, 8, 3, 7, 1, 8, 3, 7]
Output row: [7, 7, 8, 3, 1, 7, 8, 3] 
(The first [8, 3, 7] is replaced, the scanner advances 3 steps, then the second [8, 3, 7] is found and replaced).

Note: The specific sequence (ABC) and its transformation (CAB) must be determined by analyzing the training examples *before* running this transform function on a test input. This implementation requires the specific sequences to be known beforehand.
