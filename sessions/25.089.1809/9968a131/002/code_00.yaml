Task_Type: Pattern Replacement
Grid_Properties:
  - Input and Output grids consistently have the same dimensions.
  - The set of unique colors present in the input is preserved in the output.
Objects:
  - The primary objects of interest are horizontal sequences of 3 adjacent pixels.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are considered in sequences based on horizontal adjacency.
Transformation:
  - Type: Cyclic Shift Replacement.
  - Scope: Row-based, non-overlapping.
  - Rule_Derivation:
    - Compare the input and output grids of the *specific training example*.
    - Identify the first instance where a 3-pixel horizontal sequence `ABC` in the input differs from the corresponding sequence in the output.
    - Confirm that the output sequence is the right cyclic shift `CAB` of the input sequence `ABC`.
    - This pair (`ABC`, `CAB`) constitutes the specific transformation rule for that example (and its corresponding test case).
  - Rule_Application:
    - Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    - Iterate through each row of the *input* grid from top to bottom.
    - Scan each row from left to right.
    - At each position, check if the next 3 pixels match the identified `ABC` sequence.
    - If a match occurs:
      - Replace the corresponding 3 pixels in the *output grid copy* with the identified `CAB` sequence.
      - Advance the scan position by 3 steps (to ensure non-overlapping replacement).
    - If no match occurs:
      - Advance the scan position by 1 step.
    - Pixels not part of a replaced `ABC` sequence remain unchanged in the output grid copy.
Examples_Specific_Rules:
  - Example 1:
    - Input Sequence (ABC): (8, 3, 7) corresponding to (Azure, Green, Orange)
    - Output Sequence (CAB): (7, 8, 3) corresponding to (Orange, Azure, Green)
  - Example 2:
    - Input Sequence (ABC): (5, 0, 7) corresponding to (Gray, White, Orange)
    - Output Sequence (CAB): (7, 5, 0) corresponding to (Orange, Gray, White)
