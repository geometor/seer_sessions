Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples involve transforming a rectangular grid of colored pixels into another grid of the same dimensions.
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors present in the input seem to be preserved in the output, just potentially rearranged.
    *   Example 1: Orange (7), Green (3), Azure (8)
    *   Example 2: White (0), Gray (5), Orange (7)
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The changes seem localized within specific rows. Comparing input and output row by row reveals that certain horizontal sequences of three pixels are altered.
    *   In Example 1, the sequence `8 3 7` (Azure, Green, Orange) in the input rows becomes `7 8 3` (Orange, Azure, Green) in the output rows. This transformation occurs wherever the sequence `8 3 7` is found.
    *   In Example 2, the sequence `5 0 7` (Gray, White, Orange) in the input rows becomes `7 5 0` (Orange, Gray, White) in the output rows. This transformation occurs wherever the sequence `5 0 7` is found.
4.  **Rule Generalization:** The core operation appears to be identifying a specific 3-pixel horizontal sequence (let's call the pixels A, B, C) within the input and replacing it with a cyclically shifted version where the last pixel becomes the first (C, A, B). This specific sequence (`ABC`) seems constant for a given task instance (determined by the example pair) and the transformation (`ABC` -> `CAB`) is applied uniformly wherever `ABC` occurs horizontally. Pixels not part of this specific sequence remain unchanged. The replacement seems to happen for non-overlapping instances found when scanning left-to-right within each row.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Examples:
  - Input:
      Grid: [[7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 8, 3, 7], [7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 8, 3, 7]]
      Colors: [Orange, Green, Azure]
    Output:
      Grid: [[7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 7, 8, 3], [7, 3, 8, 7], [7, 7, 8, 3]]
    Transformation:
      Scope: Row-based, affects specific 3-pixel sequences.
      Identified_Sequence_Input: [8, 3, 7] (Azure, Green, Orange)
      Identified_Sequence_Output: [7, 8, 3] (Orange, Azure, Green)
      Action: Replace all non-overlapping occurrences of [8, 3, 7] with [7, 8, 3] horizontally within each row.
      Relationship: Output sequence is a right cyclic shift of the input sequence.

  - Input:
      Grid: [[0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]]
      Colors: [White, Gray, Orange]
    Output:
      Grid: [[0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7], [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7], [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]]
    Transformation:
      Scope: Row-based, affects specific 3-pixel sequences.
      Identified_Sequence_Input: [5, 0, 7] (Gray, White, Orange)
      Identified_Sequence_Output: [7, 5, 0] (Orange, Gray, White)
      Action: Replace all non-overlapping occurrences of [5, 0, 7] with [7, 5, 0] horizontally within each row.
      Relationship: Output sequence is a right cyclic shift of the input sequence.

General Observations:
  Grid_Properties:
    - Input and Output grids have the same dimensions.
    - Color palettes are preserved.
  Transformation_Rule:
    - A specific 3-pixel horizontal sequence (A, B, C) is identified from the input-output example comparison.
    - This sequence is consistently replaced by its right cyclic shift (C, A, B).
    - The replacement occurs row by row, scanning from left to right.
    - Replacements target non-overlapping occurrences of the sequence (A, B, C).
    - Pixels not part of the identified sequence (A, B, C) remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Transformation:** Examine the provided input and output training example grids. Find the first instance where a 3-pixel horizontal sequence in the input, let's call it `ABC` (composed of pixel values A, B, and C), differs from the corresponding 3-pixel sequence in the output. Confirm that the output sequence is `CAB` (the right cyclic shift of `ABC`). This pair (`ABC` -> `CAB`) defines the transformation rule for this task.
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid that is an exact copy of the input grid.
3.  **Scan and Replace:** Iterate through each row of the input grid from top to bottom. Within each row, scan from left to right using a column index.
4.  **Match Sequence:** At each position, check if the next three pixels horizontally match the sequence `ABC` identified in step 1.
5.  **Apply Transformation:** If the sequence `ABC` is found starting at the current column index:
    a.  Replace the corresponding three pixels in the *output grid* copy with the sequence `CAB`.
    b.  Advance the column index by 3 to look for the *next* potential non-overlapping match in the same row.
6.  **Advance Scan:** If the sequence `ABC` is *not* found starting at the current column index, advance the column index by 1.
7.  **Repeat:** Continue scanning and replacing within the row until the end of the row is reached (where a 3-pixel sequence can no longer fit). Proceed to the next row and repeat steps 3-6.
8.  **Finalize:** Once all rows have been processed, the modified grid copy is the final output.
```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple

"""
Identifies a specific 3-pixel horizontal sequence (A, B, C) that differs between the input and output in the training examples. 
The transformation rule observed is that this sequence ABC is replaced by its right cyclic shift CAB (where C becomes the first element).
This replacement is applied to all non-overlapping occurrences of the sequence ABC found when scanning each row of the input grid from left to right. 
Pixels not part of this specific sequence remain unchanged.

For example, if the identified rule from training is [8, 3, 7] -> [7, 8, 3]:
Input row:  [7, 8, 3, 7, 1, 8, 3, 7]
Output row: [7, 7, 8, 3, 1, 7, 8, 3] 
(The first [8, 3, 7] is replaced, the scanner advances 3 steps, then the second [8, 3, 7] is found and replaced).

Note: The specific sequence (ABC) and its transformation (CAB) must be determined by analyzing the training examples *before* running this transform function on a test input. This implementation requires the specific sequences to be known beforehand.
