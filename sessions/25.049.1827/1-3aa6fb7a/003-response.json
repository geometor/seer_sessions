There are three distinct azure regions.\n\n2.  **Identify top-left pixel**: For each azure component, determine the top-left most pixel.\n\n3.  **Add blue pixel**: Add a blue pixel (color 1) to the cell immediately to the right of each identified top-left pixel.\n\n    *   Region 1: Top-left is (0, 4). Add blue at (0+1, 4) = (1, 4).\n    *   Region 2: Top-left is (2, 2). Add blue at (2, 2+1) = (2, 3).\n    *   Region 3: Top-left is (5,4). Adding to the right means (5, 3).\n\n**Summary of the rule:**\n\nThe transformation rule is identical to the one found in the first example: For each separate region of azure pixels (color 8), a blue pixel (color 1) is added to the right of the top-left pixel of that region.\n\nThe provided python code is adequate to solve it.\n"
