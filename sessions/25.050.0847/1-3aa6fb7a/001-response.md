Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate 1x2 vertical and 2x1 horizontal azure colored clusters"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate 1x2 vertical and 2x1 horizontal azure colored clusters"
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: "Two 1x1 blue cells"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all the azure (color 8) colored clusters in the input grid. In this instance we find a 1x2 and a 2x1 cluster.

2.  **Check Blue Objects:** Verify if any blue cells (color 1) appears *adjacent* and to the *right* of the 1x2 azure object *top*, and if a blue cell (color 1) appears *adjacent* and to the *left* of the 2x1 azure object *bottom*.

3.  **Place Blue Object:** If the above condition is true, place a single blue cell (color 1) immediately *adjacent* and to the *right* of the 1x2 azure object *top*, and a single blue cell (color 1) immediately *adjacent* and to the *left* of the 2x1 azure object *bottom*.

4.   **Preserve Original:** All remaining objects and their positions in the input remain unchanged.

In summary, the rule involves identifying the specific shape/position azure clusters, and based on that, placing a blue color accordingly, and preserving the azure clusters.
