            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program correctly identifies contiguous blocks of green pixels and attempts to distinguish between \"interior\" and \"exterior\" pixels based on the number of green neighbors. However, the implementation of the \"interior\" pixel check (`count_neighbors(input_grid, r, c, 3) == 4`) is too strict.  It only considers a pixel \"interior\" if *all four* cardinal neighbors are green. This fails in cases where green blocks are adjacent to each other, or are larger than a 2x2 square. The results show consistent mismatches where yellow pixels should be, but aren't. It seems to not do well with identifying neighbor counts and adjacent regions correctly.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Improve Interior Pixel Detection:** Instead of simply checking for four green neighbors, we need to consider the overall shape of the block. An improved definition interior points requires calculating how many neighbor pixels are also members of the block.\n\n2. **Test Cases:** Use smaller more direct test case as unit tests to help verify edge cases.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary of the observations, extended with specific details about object identification, properties and actions, presented as a YAML block.\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: 004-py_02\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    object_counts: { green: 4, yellow: 0, background: 32 }\n    objects:\n      - { color: green, shape: 'L-shape', size: 4, interior_points: 0 }\n      - {color: black, shape: grid, size: 36}\n    transformations: >\n      Two green pixels that should be yellow, but aren't.  The\n      green regions are adjacent.\n    match: False\n  - example_id: 2\n    object_counts: { green: 11, yellow: 0, background: 89}\n    objects:\n        - {color: green, shape: irregular, size: 9, interior_points: 0, position: top-left, neighbors: [object_3, object_4]}\n        - {color: green, shape: L-shape, size: 3, interior_pixels: 0, postion: center-right}\n        - {color: black, shape: grid, size: 100}\n    transformations: >\n        Two green blocks. One large irregular one and one smaller L shape. The\n        yellow interior points are not being calculated in the larger block.\n    match: False\n  - example_id: 3\n    object_counts: { green: 16, yellow: 0, background: 84 }\n    transformations: >\n        Four green objects with some adjacent sides. The large contiguous block\n        of green color is not considered as one object and the transformation\n        does not result in any yellow pixels.\n    match: False\n  - example_id: 4\n    object_counts: { green: 19, yellow: 0, background: 81 }\n    transformations: >\n        A single large irregular green region with no yellow pixels after transformation\n    match: False\n  - example_id: 5\n    object_counts: { green: 35, yellow: 0, background: 365 }\n    transformations: >\n        Multiple green blocks. Some are individual pixels, others are lines and\n        squares of various size.  The larger square shape at row 10, col 7 should\n        have a large central region of yellow, but there are zero yellow pixels\n        generated by the transformation.\n    match: False\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify** all contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels in the input grid.  A contiguous block is a set of green pixels where each pixel is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to at least one other pixel in the same block.\n\n2.  **Identify** the exterior and interior pixels within each green block:\n    *   An **exterior** green pixel is part of the block and is adjacent to at least one pixel that is *not* part of the same green block (either a different color or the boundary of the grid).\n    *   An **interior** green pixel is part of the block, and all of its directly adjacent pixels (up, down, left, and right) are *also* part of the same green block.\n\n3.  **Change** all interior green pixels within each block to yellow (4).\n\n4.  All other pixels in the grid remain **unchanged**.\n"
