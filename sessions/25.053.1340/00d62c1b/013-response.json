            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies contiguous regions of green pixels. However, the `is_interior` function, which determines whether a green pixel should be turned yellow, is too strict. It requires *all* eight neighbors to be green. The examples show that a green pixel can be on the edge of a larger shape, and the inside pixels are still changed. The problem arises when parts of a green region are only one pixel wide. Such pixels don't get converted because they have fewer than 8 green neighbors. Essentially, a 'line' of green pixels is different than a 'block'.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Improve `is_interior`:** Instead of checking all 8 neighbors, we need to refine the definition of \"interior\". The current definition of being fully surrounded by green pixels does not seem to be accurate across the provided test set. Looking at the images, we are trying to color interior pixels of a green 'object'.\n2.  **Analyze Failed Examples:** Focus on the pixels that were incorrectly changed (or not changed) to understand the precise conditions that define an \"interior\" pixel in the context of *this* task.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program description to reflect the corrected logic.\n4.  **Test using code:** Add tests to confirm that the error is what we think, and to identify possible solutions.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, noting the discrepancies:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Two pixels were not turned yellow. This is the simplest failing case to study.\n*   **Example 2:** One pixel was not turned yellow. Same underlying issue as example 1.\n*   **Example 3:** Nine pixels were not turned yellow. A more complex example of the same core problem.\n*   **Example 4:** Six pixels were not turned yellow, again due to the same issue.\n*   **Example 5:** A very complex case to highlight the weakness of the current rule set, thirty-one pixels were not changed.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 012\nobjects:\n  - id: green_regions\n    color: green\n    description: Contiguous areas of green pixels\n    properties:\n      - interior_pixels:\n          definition: Pixels within a green region that should be colored yellow.\n          current_rule: All 8 neighbors must be green.  (INCORRECT)\n          proposed_rule:  Pixels on the edge are not interior. Pixels completely surrounded by green are. (NEEDS REFINEMENT)\nactions:\n  - name: change_color\n    subject: interior_pixels\n    from_color: green\n    to_color: yellow\n    conditions:\n      - subject must be part of a green_region\n      - subject must satisfy interior_pixels rule\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Green Regions:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of green (3) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Identify Interior Pixels:** Within each green region, identify \"interior\" green pixels. An interior pixel is defined as a green pixel that is part of a green object that is more than one pixel wide.\n3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of the identified interior green pixels to yellow (4).\n4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.\n\n**Next Steps**\nI will provide code to test the hypothesis about the interior rule. Specifically, I will modify the code to determine interior pixels based on a convex hull.\n"
