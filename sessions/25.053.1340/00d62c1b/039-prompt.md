Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Green Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of green (color value 3) pixels in the input grid. Pixels are considered contiguous if they are connected horizontally or vertically.

2.  **Determine Boundaries:** For each identified green region, determine its boundary. A pixel is part of the boundary if it meets *either* of these conditions:
    *   It is directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a pixel of a different color.
    *   It is adjacent to the edge of the grid.

3.  **Change Inner Pixels to Yellow:** Iterate through each pixel within each green region.
    *   If a pixel is green and *not* on the boundary of its region (i.e., it's an "inner" pixel), change its color to yellow (color value 4).
    *   If a pixel is green *and* on the boundary, its color remains unchanged.

4.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All pixels that are not green in the input grid should remain unchanged in the output grid.

5.  **Output:** The output is the modified grid after applying these transformations.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
