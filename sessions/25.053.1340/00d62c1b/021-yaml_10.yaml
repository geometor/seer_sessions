task: fill_inside_green_shape
observations:
  - type: object_identification
    description: The primary object is the largest contiguous region of green (color 3) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: green (3)
      - attribute: size (contiguous area)
      - relation: largest (compared to other green regions)

  - type: action_identification
    description:  Interior pixels of the largest green object are recolored.
    actions:
      - name: identify_interior
        method:  inverse_flood_fill (currently problematic)
        parameters:
            - exterior_color: 0 (background color)
            
      - name: recolor_interior
        parameters:
          - target_color: green (3)
          - replacement_color: yellow (4)

  - type: error_analysis
    description: "The current implementation fails due to excessive recursion, likely in the flood fill."
    error_type: maximum_recursion_depth_exceeded
    location: _dfs, _flood_fill, _find_interior_pixels_inverse_flood_fill
    
  - type: boundary_condition
    description: The edges of the grid, and the borders of the detected region, are not being correctly handled as stopping points for the flood fill operation
