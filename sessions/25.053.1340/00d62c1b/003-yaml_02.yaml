examples:
  - id: 1
    correct: false
    notes: |
      The two center-most green pixels should change to yellow. The transformation
      fails to change these pixels.
  - id: 2
    correct: false
    notes: |
      Only one pixel in the longer line of green pixels should change to yellow.
      The transformation only changes one, but the wrong one.
  - id: 3
    correct: false
    notes: |
      Many interior pixels should change, most are wrong.
  - id: 4
    correct: false
    notes: |
        Many interior pixels should change, most are wrong. Also, the top row
        of green should not all be changed.
  - id: 5
    correct: false
    notes: |
      Many interior pixels should change, most are wrong.
general:
  - The output grid size is always correct.
  - The output grid color palette is always correct (only 0, 3, and 4).
  - The simple two-neighbor rule is incorrect for many cases.
  - The rule seems to produce better results on outlines, but not the interior
    of larger blocks of green.
