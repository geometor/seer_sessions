            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe code correctly identifies contiguous blocks of green pixels. However, the `is_interior` function has a flaw. It checks if *all* neighbors are within the block. The issue arises at corners and edges of diagonal sections of a block. These are not interior cells, but all of their neighbors are other green blocks.\n\nThe strategy to fix this is to modify the `is_interior` function. Instead of checking if *all* neighbors are part of the block, we need to check if *any* neighbor is *not* part of the block. If a neighbor is not part of the block (or is outside the grid boundaries), then the pixel is an exterior pixel, not an interior one.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\nHere's a summary of the original results:\n- all examples are the correct shape\n- all examples have correct color palette\n- no examples have the correct pixel counts\n\n| Example | Match | Pixels Off | Size Correct | Color Palette Correct | Correct Pixel Counts |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | False | 2 | True | True | False |\n| 2 | False | 2 | True | True | False |\n| 3 | False | 9 | True | True | False |\n| 4 | False | 6 | True | True | False |\n| 5 | False | 31 | True | True | False |\n\n**YAML Fact Identification**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 0062599a\nobservations:\n  - object: green_blocks\n    type: contiguous_region\n    color: green\n    property: interior_pixels\n    property_to_change: color\n    new_color: yellow\n  - object: grid\n    type: 2D_array\n    action: identify_contiguous_blocks\n    parameter: color=green\n  - object: pixel\n    type: grid_cell\n    property: is_interior\n    definition:\n        criteria1: adjacent_to_same_block\n        criteria2: not_adjacent_to_different_block_or_boundary\n\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Contiguous Green Blocks:** Find all contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels in the input grid. A contiguous block is defined as a group of green pixels where each pixel is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally) to at least one other green pixel in the same block.\n\n2.  **Identify Exterior and Interior Pixels:** Within each identified green block, classify each pixel as either exterior or interior.\n    *   **Exterior Pixel:** A green pixel that is part of the block, and is adjacent to at least one pixel that is *not* part of the *same* green block (either a different color, or the boundary of the input grid). Adjacency is defined as up, down, left, or right.\n    *   **Interior Pixel:** A green pixel where *all* its directly adjacent pixels (up, down, left, and right) are *also* part of the *same* green block.\n\n3.  **Transform Interior Pixels:** Change the color of all identified *interior* green pixels to yellow (4).\n\n4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid (non-green pixels, and exterior green pixels) remain unchanged.\n"
