1.  **Identify the Largest Green Shape:** Find the largest contiguous region of green (3) pixels in the input grid. Contiguous pixels are connected horizontally or vertically.

2.  **Determine Interior Pixels (Revised):** Consider all pixels within the identified largest green shape. The "interior" pixels of this shape will become yellow. This is best described as the inverse flood fill from the exterior.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our approach.

**General Assessment:**

The code consistently fails with a "maximum recursion depth exceeded" error. This strongly indicates an issue within the recursive functions: `_dfs` (in `_find_contiguous_regions`) or `_flood_fill` (and therefore, `_find_interior_pixels_inverse_flood_fill`). The inverse flood fill approach, while conceptually sound, is likely the culprit due to its multiple recursive calls and potential for infinite loops if the boundary conditions aren't perfectly handled. The problem is the flood fill is not correctly identifying where to stop.

The strategy will be to:

1.  **Simplify:** Temporarily remove the inverse flood fill and focus on correctly identifying the largest green region.
2.  **Debug Recursion:** Add print statements inside the recursive function calls to see the row and column values and diagnose *why* the recursion is not stopping
3.  **Re-evaluate Boundary Conditions:**  Carefully review the logic that determines when the flood fill should stop. We may need a simpler way to define "interior" that doesn't rely so heavily on recursion. Consider an iterative approach to flood filling or defining interiority using direct coordinate comparisons within the bounding box of the green object.

**Gather Metrics & Example Analysis:**

I will use `code_execution` blocks, as needed, to evaluate metrics and test ideas.  Let's examine the outputs before proceeding to derive any meaningful numeric metrics, the recursion error is preventing a meanful comparison. I will address the recursion error first in the YAML and natural language program, below.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task: fill_inside_green_shape
observations:
  - type: object_identification
    description: The primary object is the largest contiguous region of green (color 3) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: green (3)
      - attribute: size (contiguous area)
      - relation: largest (compared to other green regions)

  - type: action_identification
    description:  Interior pixels of the largest green object are recolored.
    actions:
      - name: identify_interior
        method:  inverse_flood_fill (currently problematic)
        parameters:
            - exterior_color: 0 (background color)
            
      - name: recolor_interior
        parameters:
          - target_color: green (3)
          - replacement_color: yellow (4)

  - type: error_analysis
    description: "The current implementation fails due to excessive recursion, likely in the flood fill."
    error_type: maximum_recursion_depth_exceeded
    location: _dfs, _flood_fill, _find_interior_pixels_inverse_flood_fill
    
  - type: boundary_condition
    description: The edges of the grid, and the borders of the detected region, are not being correctly handled as stopping points for the flood fill operation
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Green Regions:** Identify all contiguous regions of green (3) pixels in the input grid.  Contiguous pixels are connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).

2.  **Select Largest:** Determine the largest of these green regions based on the number of pixels it contains.

3.  **Define Interior (Bounding Box Method):**  Find the bounding box of the largest green region. This is the smallest rectangle (defined by min/max row and min/max column) that completely encloses the region.  A pixel is considered "interior" if:
    *   It is part of the largest green region.
    *   It is *not* on the edge of the bounding box.  That is, its row is not the minimum or maximum row *of the region*, AND its column is not the minimum or maximum column *of the region*.

4.  **Recolor Interior:** Change the color of the identified interior pixels within the largest green region from green (3) to yellow (4).

5.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.  Pixels outside the largest green region remain unchanged.

**Revised Approach Rationale:**

The key change is in Step 3, replacing the inverse flood fill with a simpler, non-recursive "bounding box" method to define the interior. This should eliminate the recursion errors and be more robust. The original natural language program *almost* got it correct, but the inverse flood fill implementation caused trouble. The boundary conditions were not correctly stopping the recursion. The bounding box approach directly defines the "interior" in a way more suited to the structure of this problem.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
