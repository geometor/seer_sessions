Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Green Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of green (3) pixels in the input grid.  Contiguous pixels are connected horizontally or vertically.

2.  **Determine Boundaries:** For each green region, identify its boundary. The boundary consists of pixels that are adjacent to at least one pixel that is not green. Diagonal adjacency does *not* prevent a green from being on the border.

3. **Change the inside of green regions from green to Yellow:** Iterate over all pixels within each identified green region.
    * If the pixel in the region is green and belongs to the boundary of this green region, it does not change, and remains green.
    * If the pixel in the region is green and *not* on the boundary, change its color to yellow (4).

4.  **Preserve Other Colors:**  All pixels that are not green in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

5.  **Output:** The output is the grid resulting from these transformations.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
