However, the logic for selecting *which* green pixels to change is incorrect, as evidenced by the mismatches in the training examples. The current implementation changes green pixels to yellow only if they have four green neighbors. This condition does not hold true generally.\n\nThe key to improving the solution lies in refining the selection criteria for changing green pixels to yellow. By carefully analyzing the input-output pairs, we will derive a more complex rule and use it. It appears that the boundary between the green and other regions are maintained and inside of the originally green regions, the pixels change to yellow.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Closely examine the differences between the `Expected Output` and `Transformed Output` for each example. Pay particular attention to the locations where the colors differ.\n2.  **Refine Selection Rule:** Based on the mismatch analysis, formulate a more accurate rule for determining which green pixels should be changed to yellow. Consider factors like:\n    *   Neighborhood: Instead of simply counting green neighbors, analyze the colors of *all* neighbors (including diagonals).\n    *   Position within region: Are pixels at the edge of a green region treated differently than those in the center?\n    * boundary: the border between the green and other regions\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Clearly articulate the refined rule in the updated natural language program.\n4.  **Modify Code:** Update the Python code to implement the new rule.\n5.  **Iterate:** Repeat steps 1-4, testing the updated code against all training examples, until the code produces the correct output for all examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\nHere is a summary for each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:** 2 pixels are incorrect. The incorrectly transformed pixels are at (2,2) and (3,3).\n*   **Example 2:** 2 pixels are incorrect. The incorrectly transformed pixels are at (6,3) and (6,4).\n*   **Example 3:** 9 pixels are incorrect. The incorrectly transformed pixels are at (3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (6,4) and (6,5)\n*   **Example 4:** 6 pixels are incorrect. The incorrectly transformed pixels are at (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4), (7,7), (8,4)\n*    **Example 5:** 31 pixels are incorrect. There are numerous mismatched pixels.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: 034\n    examples:\n      - example: 1\n        input_objects:\n          - color: green\n            shape: irregular, cross-like\n            contiguous: True\n        output_objects:\n          - color: green\n            shape: L-shape\n            contiguous: True\n            relation_to_input: \"Part of the green region is transformed\"\n          - color: yellow\n            shape: single pixel\n            contiguous: True\n            relation_to_input: \"Inside original green region\"\n        transformations:\n          - action: \"Change color of inner green pixels to yellow. Preserve outer pixels.\"\n            condition: \"Green pixel is part of a contiguous region, preserve boundary\"\n\n      - example: 2, 3, 4, 5\n        input_objects:\n          - color: green\n            shape: \"various\"\n            contiguous: true\n        output_objects:\n          - color: green\n            shape: \"various\"\n            contiguous: true\n          - color: \"yellow\"\n            shape: \"various\"\n            contiguous: \"true, within previous green area, filling it except one layer border\"\n        transformations:\n          - action: \"Change color\"\n            condition: \"green inside boundary of green regions changes to yellow\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Green Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of green (3) pixels in the input grid.  Contiguous pixels are connected horizontally or vertically.\n\n2.  **Determine Boundaries:** For each green region, identify its boundary. The boundary consists of pixels that are adjacent to at least one pixel that is not green. Diagonal adjacency does *not* prevent a green from being on the border.\n\n3. **Change the inside of green regions from green to Yellow:** Iterate over all pixels within each identified green region.\n    * If the pixel in the region is green and belongs to the boundary of this green region, it does not change, and remains green.\n    * If the pixel in the region is green and *not* on the boundary, change its color to yellow (4).\n\n4.  **Preserve Other Colors:**  All pixels that are not green in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\n5.  **Output:** The output is the grid resulting from these transformations.\n"
