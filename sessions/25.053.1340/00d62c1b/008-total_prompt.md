"""
1.  **Identify** all contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels in the input grid.  A contiguous block is a set of green pixels where each pixel is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to at least one other pixel in the same block.

2.  **Identify** the exterior and interior pixels within each green block:
    *   An **exterior** green pixel is part of the block and is adjacent to at least one pixel that is *not* part of the same green block (either a different color or the boundary of the grid).
    *   An **interior** green pixel is part of the block, and all of its directly adjacent pixels (up, down, left, and right) are *also* part of the same green block.

3.  **Change** all interior green pixels within each block to yellow (4).

4.  All other pixels in the grid remain **unchanged**.

Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The code correctly identifies contiguous blocks of green pixels. However, the `is_interior` function has a flaw. It checks if *all* neighbors are within the block. The issue arises at corners and edges of diagonal sections of a block. These are not interior cells, but all of their neighbors are other green blocks.

The strategy to fix this is to modify the `is_interior` function. Instead of checking if *all* neighbors are part of the block, we need to check if *any* neighbor is *not* part of the block. If a neighbor is not part of the block (or is outside the grid boundaries), then the pixel is an exterior pixel, not an interior one.

**Metrics and Observations**
Here's a summary of the original results:
- all examples are the correct shape
- all examples have correct color palette
- no examples have the correct pixel counts

| Example | Match | Pixels Off | Size Correct | Color Palette Correct | Correct Pixel Counts |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | False | 2 | True | True | False |
| 2 | False | 2 | True | True | False |
| 3 | False | 9 | True | True | False |
| 4 | False | 6 | True | True | False |
| 5 | False | 31 | True | True | False |

**YAML Fact Identification**

    definition:
        criteria1: adjacent_to_same_block
        criteria2: not_adjacent_to_different_block_or_boundary

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Contiguous Green Blocks:** Find all contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels in the input grid. A contiguous block is defined as a group of green pixels where each pixel is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally) to at least one other green pixel in the same block.

2.  **Identify Exterior and Interior Pixels:** Within each identified green block, classify each pixel as either exterior or interior.
    *   **Exterior Pixel:** A green pixel that is part of the block, and is adjacent to at least one pixel that is *not* part of the *same* green block (either a different color, or the boundary of the input grid). Adjacency is defined as up, down, left, or right.
    *   **Interior Pixel:** A green pixel where *all* its directly adjacent pixels (up, down, left, and right) are *also* part of the *same* green block.

3.  **Transform Interior Pixels:** Change the color of all identified *interior* green pixels to yellow (4).

4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid (non-green pixels, and exterior green pixels) remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
