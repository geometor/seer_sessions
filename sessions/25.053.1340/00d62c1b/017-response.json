These digits correspond to different colors. The primary transformation seems to involve identifying a specific shape formed by a contiguous block of pixels of a particular color (in this case, '3' or green) and then changing the color of a subset of those pixels to another color (in this case, '4' or yellow). The subset appears to be the interior pixels of the shape.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Contiguous means connected horizontally or vertically.\n2. **Find Interior Pixels:** Within the identified shape, determine the \"interior\" pixels. A pixel is considered \"interior\" if it's part of the shape (value '3') and is surrounded on all four sides (up, down, left, right) by other pixels that are also part of the shape. It may be useful to think of this as the inverse flood-fill from the outer edge using the same color.\n3. **Recolor Interior:** Change the color value of all identified interior pixels from '3' (green) to '4' (yellow).\n4. **Output:** The resulting grid, with the interior of the shape recolored, is the output.\n"
