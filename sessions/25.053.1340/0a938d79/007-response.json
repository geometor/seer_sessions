            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and its underlying logic are partially correct but fail to capture the nuances of the transformations in all examples. The core issue lies in how the code handles the \"row copy\" behavior and how it determines when to stop copying. The alternating column fill works in some simple cases but is not generally applied correctly when seed pixels span multiple columns. The handling of subsequent seed pixels after a filled row is also faulty, especially across multiple \"chunks\" of filled and then copied rows.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Row Copying Logic:** The current logic stops copying rows downward only when it encounters a non-white pixel *in any column*. The correct behavior is to copy the seed row and subsequent *white* rows until a non-white row is encountered.\n2.  **Handle Seed Pixel Stacks:** When seed pixels exist only within a single column, stacked on top of each other, the current code incorrectly alternates columns and misses copying following white pixels down\n3.  **Improve Alternating Column Logic**: The columns seem to always alternate, based on the two leftmost seed pixels and only in the areas after the seed pixels have appeared. This may require revisiting this behavior with a more precise definition.\n4. **Iterative Testing and Error Analysis**: Focus on examples with errors.  For each failed example, carefully analyze *why* the output differs from the expected output. Use this analysis to incrementally refine the natural language program and then, subsequently, the code.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Observation:**  The code incorrectly alternates colors between only columns 6 & 7 using color `2` and color `8`. Expected behavior is to use the colors of the first two seed pixels found from left to right and alternate these colors on all columns to the right of the first seen seed pixel\n    *   **Metrics:** `pixels_off`: 150.  This confirms that many pixels are incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Observation:**  The code incorrectly alternates colors between only columns 5 & 6 using color `1` and color `3`. Expected behavior is to use the colors of the first two seed pixels found from left to right and alternate these colors on all columns to the right of the first seen seed pixel\n    *   **Metrics:** `pixels_off`: 84.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Observation:** The code starts the alternating fill immediately, even though the seed pixels are not adjacent. It also does not copy rows correctly after it has encountered a seed pixel. It incorrectly assumes a horizontal layout. It fills all cells with the pattern.\n    *   **Metrics:** `pixels_off`: 157.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   **Observation:** The code does *not* propagate the seed row and following white rows, only copies the seed color down in the first column, until a new row with a seed color is encountered.\n    *   **Metrics:** `pixels_off`: 49.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    seed_pixels:\n      - [0, 5, 2]\n      - [9, 7, 8]\n    layout: horizontal\n    transformation: alternating_columns\n    alternating_colors: [2, 8]\n    alternating_start_column: 5\n\n  - id: 2\n    seed_pixels:\n      - [0, 5, 1]\n      - [6, 8, 3]\n    layout: horizontal\n    transformation: alternating_columns\n    alternating_colors: [1, 3]\n    alternating_start_column: 5\n\n  - id: 3\n    seed_pixels:\n      - [5, 0, 2]\n      - [7, 8, 3]\n    layout: vertical\n    transformation: row_copy_and_following_white_rows\n    copy_color_vertically:\n      - 2\n      - 3\n\n  - id: 4\n    seed_pixels:\n      - [7, 0, 4]\n      - [11, 0, 1]\n    layout: vertical\n    transformation: row_copy_and_following_white_rows\n    copy_color_vertically:\n      - 4\n      - 1\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find Seed Pixels:** Identify all non-white pixels (pixels with values other than 0) in the input grid. These are the \"seed pixels.\"\n\n2.  **Determine Layout and Transformation Type:**\n    *   If all seed pixels are in the same column, the layout is considered \"vertical,\" and the transformation is \"row copy and following white rows.\"\n    *   If seed pixels appear in different columns, the layout is considered \"horizontal,\" and the transformation is \"alternating columns.\"\n\n3.  **Horizontal Layout - Alternating Columns:**\n    *   Identify the two leftmost seed pixels.\n    *   Starting from the column of the *leftmost* seed pixel, fill the entire grid to the *right*, alternating the colors of the two identified seed pixels column by column.\n\n4.  **Vertical Layout - Row Copy and Following White Rows:**\n    * Sort the seed pixels by their row index.\n    * For each seed pixel row (from top to bottom, from the first seed pixel down):\n        *   Copy the entire seed pixel row to the output grid.\n        *   Continue copying the content of the original seed row to subsequent rows in the output grid.\n        *   Stop copying when you encounter a row in the *input* grid that contains any non-white pixel.\n        * Continue with next seed row.\n    * Copy all other rows to the output grid, matching input.\n"
