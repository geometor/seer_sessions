The primary elements are individual cells (pixels) within the grids, characterized by their color (represented by a digit) and position (row and column indices). The input grid appears to be transformed into the output grid based on some rule involving the replication and positioning of specific colored rows. Specifically, rows with non-zero single pixels are replaced with multiple, solid colored, rows.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
