Both grids contain single-digit integer values (0-9), which represent different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and green (3). The input grid appears mostly white, with a single red pixel and a single green pixel located in seemingly arbitrary positions. The output grid shows a pattern where the red and green pixels from the input grid have been \"extended\" or \"filled\" into horizontal lines that repeat across the entire grid. The areas between repeated green and red lines seem to alternate.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Note their original row indices.\n2.  **Horizontal Extension:** For the row containing the red pixel, replace all pixel values in that row with red (2). Similarly, for the row containing the green pixel, replace all pixel values in that row with green (3).\n3.  **Repeating Pattern:**\n    *   Copy the red and green lines, interleaving a blank (white, value 0) line after each color line.\n    *   Repeat the three lines created, the red line, then a white line, then a green line, then a white line, until the output_grid is filled.\n\n"
