            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code performs well on the first example but fails on the second and third. The primary issue seems to be the leftward propagation. It stops correctly when encountering a non-zero pixel *in the original grid*, but it doesn't always fill the *correct* number of cells to the left. The filling sometimes goes too far. It looks like we need to rethink how the leftward filling is tied to the initially identified rightmost non-zero pixel. Specifically, leftward fill should only happen if there is a non-zero pixel downwards.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Gather Metrics:** I'll use code execution to double-check pixel differences and confirm my initial assessment quantitatively. I'll also check the input grids.\n2.  **Refine Observations:** Based on the metrics, I'll re-examine the relationship between the rightmost pixel and the leftward filling, looking for patterns that explain the discrepancies.\n3.  **Update YAML and Natural Language Program:** I will update the YAML with facts to account for the new information. I will rephrase the natural language program to precisely define the downward and leftward propagation rules, ensuring it's consistent with *all* examples.\n\n**Gather Metrics (Code Execution):**\n\n"
