Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code performs well on the first example but fails on the second and third. The primary issue seems to be the leftward propagation. It stops correctly when encountering a non-zero pixel *in the original grid*, but it doesn't always fill the *correct* number of cells to the left. The filling sometimes goes too far. It looks like we need to rethink how the leftward filling is tied to the initially identified rightmost non-zero pixel. Specifically, leftward fill should only happen if there is a non-zero pixel downwards.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Gather Metrics:** I'll use code execution to double-check pixel differences and confirm my initial assessment quantitatively. I'll also check the input grids.
2.  **Refine Observations:** Based on the metrics, I'll re-examine the relationship between the rightmost pixel and the leftward filling, looking for patterns that explain the discrepancies.
3.  **Update YAML and Natural Language Program:** I will update the YAML with facts to account for the new information. I will rephrase the natural language program to precisely define the downward and leftward propagation rules, ensuring it's consistent with *all* examples.

**Gather Metrics (Code Execution):**


``` python
import numpy as np

# Example 1
input1 = np.array([[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 0], [3, 0, 0]])
expected1 = np.array([[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6]])
transformed1 = np.array([[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6]])

# Example 2
input2 = np.array([[0, 2, 0], [7, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0]])
expected2 = np.array([[0, 2, 0], [7, 2, 8], [7, 2, 8]])
transformed2 = np.array([[0, 2, 0], [7, 2, 8], [8, 8, 8]])

# Example 3
input3 = np.array([[4, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]])
expected3 = np.array([[4, 0, 0], [4, 2, 0], [4, 2, 0]])
transformed3 = np.array([[4, 0, 0], [4, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0]])

def compare_grids(expected, transformed):
    diff = np.sum(expected != transformed)
    return diff

diff1 = compare_grids(expected1, transformed1)
diff2 = compare_grids(expected2, transformed2)
diff3 = compare_grids(expected3, transformed3)


print(f'{diff1=}')
print(f'{diff2=}')
print(f'{diff3=}')

```
```
diff1=np.int64(0)
diff2=np.int64(2)
diff3=np.int64(1)

```
**YAML Facts:**


```yaml

      0 4 0
      3 0 0

    observations:
      - object: rightmost_non_zero_pixel
        properties:

        actions:
          - propagate_down:  value fills down the column
          - propagate_left: value fills left until blocked by the original grid's non-zero pixel
  - input: |

          - propagate_left: value fills left until blocked by the original input grid's non-zero pixel. Only occurs if propagation down has occurred.
  - input: |

         properties:
           - value: non-zero
           - location: rightmost in each row
         actions:
           - propagate_down: value fills down the column
           - propagate_left: value fills left until blocked by the original input grid's non-zero pixel or beginning of row. Only occurs if propagation down has occurred.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate through Rows:** Process each row of the input grid sequentially, from top to bottom.
2.  **Find Rightmost Non-zero Pixel:** In the current row, identify the rightmost pixel with a non-zero value.
3.  **Propagate Downwards:** If a rightmost non-zero pixel is found, copy its value to all cells directly below it in the same column, for all subsequent rows.
4. **Conditional Leftward Propogation:**
    For each row *below* the one where the rightmost non-zero pixel was originally found, check the cell filled in by propogation down.
    Propagate *that* value to the left one at at time stopping if:
        The beginning of the row is reached.
        A non-zero pixel exists in the original input grid
