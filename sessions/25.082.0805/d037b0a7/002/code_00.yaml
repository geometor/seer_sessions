facts:
  - observation: |
      Each row in the input grid contains zero or more '0' (white) pixels and potentially one or more non-zero colored pixels.
  - object_identification: |
      The primary objects are pixels within a 2D grid.  Each pixel has a color (represented by an integer).
  - action: |
      The rightmost non-zero pixel in each row is identified.
  - propagation: |
      The color of the identified pixel is propagated downwards in subsequent rows.
  - constraint: |
      Propagation is limited to the column of the identified pixel and the columns to its *left until a non zero pixel*.
  - boundary_condition: |
     The propagation only affects rows *below* the row where the rightmost non-zero pixel was found.
  - input_output_relation: |
      The output grid is a modified version of the input grid where pixel colors have been propagated based on the stated rules.
