## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```


**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 4 4
8 8 8 8 8 8
```


**output:**
```
4 8 4 8 4 8
8 4 8 4 8 4
```

Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example pair and attempt to discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input consists of two rows of single-digit numbers. Each row contains the same digit repeated six times.
*   The output also consists of two rows.
* The output appears to be an interleaving of the digits from the input rows.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: row
    properties:
      - elements: List[int] # List of integers in the row
      - length: int # Length of the row
    actions:
      - interleave: #interleave elements with other row
        parameters:
          other_row: row

  - type: grid
    properties:
      - rows: List[row]
    actions:
       - create_output_grid: #create output grid by interleaving rows of input grid
          parameters: {}
relationships:
    - type: element_of
      description: Each number is an element of a row
    - type: composed_of
      description: The grid is composed of rows

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  The input is a grid of two rows, with each row containing a single, repeated digit.
2.  The output grid is also made of two rows.
3.  The first row of the output grid is created by alternating the digits from the first and second rows of the input grid.
4.  The second row of the output grid is created by alternating the digits of the second and first row of the input. Specifically, take an element of the second input row, and element of the first input row, etc.
5. Combine the rows to form the output grid.

In summary, the transformation rule involves interleaving the digits of the two input rows to create the two output rows.
