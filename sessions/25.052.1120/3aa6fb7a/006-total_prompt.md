Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial observations:

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: (1,1)  # Top-left corner of the L
        count: 2
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: (1,1)
        count: 2
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: varies  # Inserted inside the L-shapes.
        count: 2
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Here's a natural language description of the transformation, focusing on objects, predicates, and actions:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can see two "L-shaped" objects made of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Locate Insertion Point:** For each L-shaped object, we locate the "inner corner" of the L. This is the cell that *would* complete a 2x2 square with the three cells forming the L.

3.  **Insert Color:** A new cell with color 1 (blue) is placed at each located inner corner. The existing azure objects remain.

**Natural Language Program**

The following steps constitute the natural language program to do the transformation.

1. Find all L-shaped objects of color 8.
2. For each such object, locate the inner corner cell where the color 1 will go.
3. Change the color of the cell to 1.


```python
"""
Transformation Rule:

1.  Identify L-shaped objects (color 8) in the input grid.
2.  For each L-shaped object, find the "inner corner" cell.
3.  Insert a cell of color 1 (blue) at each inner corner.
"""

    l_shapes = []
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for r in range(rows - 1):

                if grid[r + 1, c] == color and grid[r, c + 1] == color:
                    l_shapes.append((r, c))
                # Check for L-shape (tip at top-right)
                elif grid[r + 1, c] == color and grid[r, c-1] == color and c > 0:

         return (r + 1, c + 1)

    elif grid[r + 1, c] == color and grid[r, c - 1] == color:
        return (r+1, c-1)
        
    elif grid[r - 1, c] == color and grid[r, c + 1] == color:
        return (r-1, c+1)

Okay, let's analyze the second example. The transformation appears to be the same as in the first example.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: varies
        count: 3
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: varies
        count: 3
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: varies  # Inside the L-shapes.
        count: 3
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

The rule seems identical to the first example:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Identify all L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.

2.  **Locate Insertion Point:** For each L-shaped object, determine the "inner corner" – the cell that would form a 2x2 square with the three cells of the L.

3.  **Insert Color:** Place a cell of color 1 (blue) at the identified inner corner of each L-shape. The azure L-shapes persist.

**Natural Language Program**

The natural language program is the same as before.

1. Find all L-shaped objects of color 8.
2. For each such object, locate the inner corner cell where the color 1 will go.
3. Change the color of the cell to 1.

The previously developed Python code should correctly handle this example as well, since it implements this exact rule.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
