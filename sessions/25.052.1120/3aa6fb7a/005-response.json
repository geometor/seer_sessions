The transformation appears to be the same as in the first example.\n\n**Observations and Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  input_grid:\n    size: 7x7\n    objects:\n      - color: 8 (azure)\n        shape: L-shape\n        position: varies\n        count: 3\n  output_grid:\n    size: 7x7\n    objects:\n      - color: 8 (azure)\n        shape: L-shape\n        position: varies\n        count: 3\n      - color: 1 (blue)\n        shape: single cell\n        position: varies  # Inside the L-shapes.\n        count: 3\n```\n\n**Determining the Transformation Rule**\n\nThe rule seems identical to the first example:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Identify all L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Locate Insertion Point:** For each L-shaped object, determine the \"inner corner\" \u2013 the cell that would form a 2x2 square with the three cells of the L.\n\n3.  **Insert Color:** Place a cell of color 1 (blue) at the identified inner corner of each L-shape. The azure L-shapes persist.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nThe natural language program is the same as before.\n\n1. Find all L-shaped objects of color 8.\n2. For each such object, locate the inner corner cell where the color 1 will go.\n3. Change the color of the cell to 1.\n\nThe previously developed Python code should correctly handle this example as well, since it implements this exact rule.\n"
