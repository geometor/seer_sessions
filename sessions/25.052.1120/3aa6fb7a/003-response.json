            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and refine the natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Initial Natural Language Program (from the previous code):**\n\n1.  Identify L-shaped objects (color 8) in the input grid.\n2.  For each L-shaped object, find the \"inner corner\" cell.\n3.  Insert a cell of color 1 (blue) at each inner corner.\n\n**Analysis of the Results and Refinement:**\n\nThe initial program works correctly for Example 1, but fails on Example 2. The issue is not in identifying the L-shapes or their inner corners; the `find_l_shapes` and `get_inner_corner` functions seem to work correctly based on the provided test output. The failure in Example 2 arises in line 69 of the provided code.\n\nI traced what must be happening:\n1. output_grid is initilized as a copy of input_grid\n2. The coordinates of inner_corner is determined from output_grid\n3. At line 69, output_grid is changed in place using: output_grid[inner_corner] = 1\n\nThe error is due to line 69.\n\nLooking back at example two, in the last azure L shape, the final blue\npixel is placed incorrectly in (5,3) when it should be in (5,4). The reason is\nthat the position of the correct corner depends on the location of the *tip*\nof the L-shape.\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify L-shaped objects:** Find all L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure) in the input grid. An L-shape is defined as three connected cells of color 8 where two cells are adjacent in a row or column, and the third cell is adjacent to one of those two, forming a 2x2 square with one cell missing.\n\n2.  **Locate the Inner Corner:** For each identified L-shape, determine the \"inner corner.\" The inner corner is the cell *adjacent* to the 'tip' of the L and that would complete a 2x2 square. This cell is always adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to two cells of the L-shape. It never touches the tip diagonally.\n\n3. **Insert Blue Cell**: Change color of inner corner to 1(blue).\n\nThis revised natural language program more accurately captures the core logic of the transformation. It explicitly defines what an \"L-shape\" and its \"inner corner\" are in this context, focusing on the adjacency and the formation of a potential 2x2 square. This removes the ambiguity, leading to the correct transformation.\n"
