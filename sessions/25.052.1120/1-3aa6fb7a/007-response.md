Okay, here's a refined natural language description of the transformation rule, taking into account the provided code and the results, particularly the failure in Example 2:

**Natural Language Program (Revised)**

1.  **Identify L-Shaped Objects:** Locate all "L" shaped objects within the input grid. These objects are composed of three contiguous cells of color 8 (azure) that form a 2x2 square with one cell missing. The "L" can be in any of the four possible orientations.

2.  **Locate the Inner Corner:** For each identified L-shaped object, pinpoint the "inner corner." The inner corner is the single cell *adjacent* to the three cells forming the "L" in a diagonal direction. Specifically, it's the cell that would complete the 2x2 square. It's important to determine the correct inner corner based on the orientation of the "L".

3. **Add blue to internal corner** Change the value (color) of the inner corner to 1 (blue).

4.  **Preserve Other Cells:** All other cells in the grid that are not identified as the inner corner of an L-shape should remain unchanged.

**Explanation of the Error in Example 2 and the Revised Description**

The previous code almost correctly identified the inner corner, however, the second example wasn't changing all internal corners of the L shapes to blue. The revised logic correctly changes *every* inner corner of an azure L shape to blue.

The code and description above represent the same idea, the inner corner of an azure "L" changes to blue.
