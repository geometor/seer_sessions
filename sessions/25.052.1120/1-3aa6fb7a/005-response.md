Okay, let's analyze the second example. The transformation appears to be the same as in the first example.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: varies
        count: 3
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: varies
        count: 3
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: varies  # Inside the L-shapes.
        count: 3
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

The rule seems identical to the first example:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Identify all L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.

2.  **Locate Insertion Point:** For each L-shaped object, determine the "inner corner" – the cell that would form a 2x2 square with the three cells of the L.

3.  **Insert Color:** Place a cell of color 1 (blue) at the identified inner corner of each L-shape. The azure L-shapes persist.

**Natural Language Program**

The natural language program is the same as before.

1. Find all L-shaped objects of color 8.
2. For each such object, locate the inner corner cell where the color 1 will go.
3. Change the color of the cell to 1.

The previously developed Python code should correctly handle this example as well, since it implements this exact rule.
