**Perception of Elements**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The primary colors observed are gray (5) and white (0) in the input, and white (0), blue (1), and gray (5) in the output. The gray pixels appear to be the focal points of the transformation.

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - cells: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          - white (0)
          - gray (5)
          - blue (1)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: surround
    agent: gray pixel
    target: adjacent cells
    effect: change color to blue (1)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: 8-connected neighborhood (including diagonals)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Gray Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid with the value 5 (gray).

2.  **Surround with Blue:** For each gray pixel, change the color of all its 8-connected neighboring pixels (including diagonals) to 1 (blue). If a neighbor is already gray (5), do not change it to blue.

3. **Gray Pixels Unchanged**: gray pixels retain their original location and color

4.  **Output Grid:** The resulting grid after applying these changes is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
