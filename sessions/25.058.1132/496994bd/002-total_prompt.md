**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The input grids are transformed into output grids of the same dimensions. The primary colors involved seem to be red (2), green (3), azure (8), and white (0). The transformation appears to involve a vertical reflection or flipping of a specific region of the input grid. The non-white region seems to be the focus of the flip.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      colors: [0, 2, 3, 8]
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: same as input_grid
      columns: same as input_grid
      colors: [0, 2, 3, 8]
  - object: non_white_region
    type: subgrid
    properties:
      start_row: index of first non-white row
      end_row: index of last non-white row +1
  - action: vertical_flip
    description: Reverses the order of rows within the non-white region.
    input: non_white_region
    output: flipped_non_white_region
  - relationship:
      description: The output grid is created by replacing the non-white area with the flipped version.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Non-White Region:** Find the indices of the first and last rows in the input grid that contain non-white pixels (values other than 0).
2.  **Extract the Region:** Create a subgrid consisting of the rows identified in step 1.
3.  **Vertical Flip:** Reverse the order of the rows within this subgrid.
4. **Construct the output grid:** copy all of the white area of the input grid to the output grid.
5. **replace the non-white area:** replace the non-white rows in the copy of the input grid with the flipped rows.

Essentially, the transformation vertically flips the contiguous block of non-white rows in the input grid to produce the output grid. The white rows act as padding or a background that remains unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
