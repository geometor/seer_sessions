The input grids are transformed into output grids of the same dimensions. The primary colors involved seem to be red (2), green (3), azure (8), and white (0). The transformation appears to involve a vertical reflection or flipping of a specific region of the input grid. The non-white region seems to be the focus of the flip.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The white rows act as padding or a background that remains unchanged.\n"
