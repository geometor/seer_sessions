**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7F0A627D85F0>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7F0A627D8D70>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The transformation appears to be a rotation of the grid. The colors/numbers themselves don't seem to change; rather, their positions within the grid are altered.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color: represented by integer value
      - position: row and column index

actions:
  - type: rotation
    direction: counter-clockwise
    degrees: 90

relationships:
  - element_positions: change according to rotation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid. The values within the grid (representing colors) remain the same, but their positions are updated based on the rotation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
