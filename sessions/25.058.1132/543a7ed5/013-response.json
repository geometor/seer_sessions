The input grid primarily consists of azure (8) and magenta (6) pixels. The output grid introduces green (3) and yellow (4) pixels, modifying some of the existing azure and magenta pixels. The shapes formed by the magenta pixels in the input seem to influence the placement of the new colors in the output. There appears to be an expansion or filling operation related to connected components of magenta.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

If a magenta pixel is next to a newly green pixel, change it to yellow.\n4.  **Leave Remaining Pixels:** Any pixels not affected by the above rules retain their original color from the input grid.\n\nIn summary the logic transforms the images by:\n\n*   Magenta (6) connected regions are identified.\n*   An outline in green is created for each connected component.\n*  Magenta pixels on a one-pixel boundary become yellow where there is an adjacent green pixel.\n"
