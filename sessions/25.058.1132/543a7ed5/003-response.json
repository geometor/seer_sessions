            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good start, correctly identifying the core concepts of rectangle detection, conditional filling, and adjacency-based color changes. However, the test results reveal some discrepancies, particularly in handling edge cases and the precise definition of \"center\" and \"enclosure,\" and overlooking that there are rectangle outlines that should not be modified. We need to refine these aspects to achieve perfect matching.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n1.  **Clarify \"Enclosure\":** Ensure the `encloses_color` function only considers a full enclosure. It must check that azure pixels exist inside the magenta.\n2.  **Refine \"Center\":** It should check for empty space on all four sides.\n3. **Preserve Unchanged:** Add an additional check if the magenta rectangle *doesn't* enclose any azure(8).\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated code after each modification to isolate the impact of each change.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo understand what's happening, I need to examine the input and output grids and intermediate steps.\n\n```python\ndef get_grid_string(grid):\n    return '\\n'.join(''.join(str(cell) for cell in row) for row in grid)\n\ntask_data = {\n\"train\": [\n    {\n      \"input\": [\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n      ],\n      \"output\": [\n        [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n        [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n        [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n        [3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3],\n        [3, 3, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 3, 3, 3],\n        [3, 3, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 3, 3, 3],\n        [3, 3, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 3, 3, 3],\n        [3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3],\n        [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n        [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n        [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"input\": [\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n      ],\n      \"output\": [\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"input\": [\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n      ],\n      \"output\": [\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n      ]\n    },\n        {\n      \"input\": [\n        [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n        [6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6],\n        [6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6],\n        [6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6],\n        [6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6],\n        [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n      ],\n      \"output\": [\n        [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n        [6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6],\n        [6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6],\n        [6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6],\n        [6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6],\n        [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nfor i in range(len(task_data[\"train\"])):\n\n    input_grid = np.array(task_data[\"train\"][i][\"input\"])\n    expected_output = np.array(task_data[\"train\"][i][\"output\"])\n    predicted_output = transform(input_grid)\n\n    print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n    print(\"Input:\")\n    print(get_grid_string(input_grid))\n    print(\"Expected Output:\")\n    print(get_grid_string(expected_output))\n    print(\"Predicted Output:\")\n    print(get_grid_string(predicted_output))\n    print(\"Match:\", np.array_equal(expected_output, predicted_output))\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n```\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n```yaml\n- example_1:\n    objects:\n        -
