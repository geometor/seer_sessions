The primary colors involved are azure (8), magenta (6), green (3), and yellow (4). The input grid appears to have two distinct magenta (6) shapes embedded within an azure (8) background. The output grid seems to modify the input grid by:\n\n1.  Changing some of the azure (8) pixels to green (3).\n2.  Introducing yellow (4) pixels inside one of the pre-existing shapes.\n3.  The shapes defined by magenta pixels appear to become filled and outlined with green.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"
