Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Magenta Rectangles:** Locate all rectangular shapes formed by contiguous magenta (6) pixels.

2.  **Conditional Outline Modification:**
    *   If a magenta rectangle *does not* enclose any azure (8) pixels, change all its magenta (6) pixels to green (3).
    *   If a magenta rectangle *does* enclose one or more azure (8) pixels, proceed to step 3, but do not change it's outline to green.

3.  **Conditional Center Filling:** If a magenta rectangle completely encloses one or more azure (8) pixels, replace the "center" azure (8) pixels with a yellow (4) square. The "center" is defined as the largest possible square of azure pixels within the magenta rectangle, maintaining equal distance from all four sides of the outer magenta rectangle. If an equal distance cannot be created because the rectangle's inner area is not large enough, then do not fill.

4.  **Background Color Change:** Any azure (8) pixel that is directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) to a green (3) or yellow (4) pixel is changed to green (3).

5. **Preserve Unchanged:** any azure(8) pixels not adjacent to other colors remain unchanged, and any magenta(6) rectangles that enclose other colors, remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
