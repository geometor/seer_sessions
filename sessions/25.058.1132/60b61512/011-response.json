            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and code were partially correct, focusing on identifying and transforming specific yellow pixels based on their surrounding context. However, the results across multiple training examples reveal inconsistencies and missed transformations. The primary issue seems to be an overly specific initial condition set, based mostly on the first training example that does not generalize to other examples. Specifically, it assumed the context was always related to a 3x2 yellow area. We need a program and code that is more generic, more robust across a range of contexts.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* provided input/output pairs, not just the first, to identify common patterns and variations in the transformation rule.\n2.  **Simplify Conditions:** Instead of hardcoding specific arrangements (like 3x2 blocks), look for more generalizable relationships between yellow pixels (e.g., adjacency, relative position). It is about the blocks of pixels.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Update the natural language program incrementally, testing after each modification.\n4.  **Focus on Yellow:** The transformation *only* affects yellow pixels. Other colors are distractors.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo better understand, I'll manually describe a report for each input/output and then follow up with YAML. I don't have the capacity to execute the code, so my observations will be based on visual inspection of what was provided.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: A 6x6 grid with some yellow blocks.\n    *   Output: Yellow pixels that are part of the biggest horizontal yellow block on it's right are changed to orange.\n    *   Result: Partially correct. Some yellow pixels are correctly changed to orange.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 7x7 grid.\n    *   Output: The yellow pixels at the right of the biggest horizontal yellow blocks get changed to orange.\n    *   Result: Partially correct. Some yellow pixels are correctly changed to orange.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid.\n    *   Output: The yellow pixels at the right of the biggest horizontal yellow blocks get changed to orange.\n    *   Result: Partially correct. Some yellow pixels are correctly changed to orange.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 7b6014b5\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    objects:\n      - type: grid\n        dimensions: 6x6\n        properties:\n          - contains_color: yellow\n          - contains_color: white\n    actions:\n      - description: \"Change specific yellow pixels to orange based on their context and the largest block.\"\n        details: \"Yellow pixels at the right end of the largest horizontal line are turned orange\"\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    objects:\n      - type: grid\n        dimensions: 7x7\n        properties:\n          - contains_color: yellow\n          - contains_color: white\n    actions:\n      - description: \"Change specific yellow pixels to orange based on their context and the largest block.\"\n        details: \"Yellow pixels at the right end of the largest horizontal line are turned orange\"\n\n  - example_id: 3\n    objects:\n      - type: grid\n        dimensions: 5x5\n        properties:\n          - contains_color: yellow\n          - contains_color: white\n    actions:\n      - description: \"Change specific yellow pixels to orange based on their context and the largest block.\"\n        details: \"Yellow pixels at the right end of the largest horizontal line are turned orange\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify** all horizontal lines of yellow pixels.\n2.  Determine, of the lines, which line(s) is the largest.\n3.  Locate, in the input grid, the yellow pixel(s) at the right end of the largest horizontal line(s) of yellow.\n4.  **Change** the color of *those* identified yellow pixels to orange (7).\n5.  **Preserve** all other pixels as they are in the input.\n"
