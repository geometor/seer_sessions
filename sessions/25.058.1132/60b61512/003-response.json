The primary colors observed are white (0) and yellow (4). The output introduces a new color, orange (7). The spatial arrangement of the yellow pixels seems crucial. The transformation appears to involve changing some yellow pixels to orange based on their position relative to other yellow pixels. It seems that a new color, orange, might be used to indicate some relationship *between* yellow objects.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Contiguous means connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n2.  **Locate Interior Yellow Pixels:** Within each yellow cluster, identify yellow pixels that are \"surrounded\" or are \"between\" by other yellow pixels. The exact meaning of \"between\" is important, and from observation it means:\n    *   A yellow pixel has another yellow pixel directly above *and* below\n    *   A yellow pixel has another yellow pixel directly to the left *and* to the right\n3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of the identified interior yellow pixels to orange (7).\n4. All other pixels remain the same color.\n\nIn summary, the program detects connected groups of yellow pixels and fills the \"inner\" pixels with orange. The exact definition of inner is horizontal and vertical neighbors, and the core of the rule.\n"
