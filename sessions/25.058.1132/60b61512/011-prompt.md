Previous Code:

"""
1.  **Identify** all yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Locate any yellow pixels that are directly below the top-right most yellow pixel and is part of a cluster of at least one other yellow pixel, and is not boardered by yellow on both the left and right,
3. Or, locate any yellow pixel that is directly above another yellow that is part of a 3x2 yellow area.
4.  **Change** the color of the identified yellow pixels to orange (7).
5.  **Preserve** all other pixels (white and the remaining yellow) as they are in the input.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
