      transformation: "Fill inside of top yellow outlined rectange with blue, others with red"
      result: "Mismatch. The inside of the yellow rectangles was not filled."

          color: 4
          border_only: true
          filled_color: 2 # should be after transform
    transformation: "Fill the inside of all yellow rectangles blue. This example only had one rectangle"
    result: "Mismatch. Inner area of rectangle should be 2, not 4 (unchanged)."
general_rule: "Identify all yellow (4) rectangles. Fill the inside area of the rectangles according to a rule applied to each one individually. The rule seems to be to count the yellow rectangles starting from the top at 1, filling odd numbered rects blue and even numbered rects red. Rectangles are considered outlined."
