transformed_region:
  description:  A rectangular region extending one row that completely contains all red pixels.
                 The region starts at the top-most row of any red pixel, and extends to include the entire
                 row of the lowest red pixel.
                 The region's left column is the left-most red pixel.
                 The region's right column is the right-most red pixel.
