The primary colors involved seem to be red (2), white (0), gray (5), and blue (1). The transformation seems to selectively replace some pixels, primarily white (0) and gray(5) pixels with blue (1) pixels, maintaining the shape, especially at the top. There appears to be a focus on changing colors within the top portion of the grid, defined by the red and white pixels. There are connected component.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In the examples, this is typically rows 1-4.\n2. **Conditional replacement:** If the connected components in the upper section contains gray pixels, change those gray pixels to blue.\n3. **Conditional Replacement:** Within this region, replace white (0) pixels with blue (1) pixels. Preserve red (2) pixels.\n4.  **Preserve Lower Region:** Leave the rest of the grid (pixels below the defined region) unchanged. Specifically gray and white region under.\n\nEssentially, the transformation recolors a specific part of the \"background\" (white pixels) within a region defined by the arrangement of red and white pixels to blue, and, if, gray pixels is containded in this region, change them to blue too.\n"
