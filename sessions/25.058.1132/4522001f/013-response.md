Okay, let's analyze the provided code, training results, and formulate a revised natural language program and supporting documentation.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code implements a simple expansion rule: each pixel in the 3x3 input becomes a 3x3 block in the output. Red pixels are specifically transformed to green. The test results, however, reveal a significant flaw: the transformation logic is incomplete because only the first train example's output matched, train example 2 and train example 3 did not match. The initial observation isn't wrong, it is simply incomplete. We need to discern the *complete* transformation logic that accounts for all given examples. The core issue seems to be that the current rule is too simplistic and doesn't fully capture the conditional color change.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, including dimensions, colors, and spatial relationships, with an emphasis on finding a consistent rule that applies to *all* examples, not just the first.
2.  **Conditional Logic:** Pay close attention to the conditions under which color changes occur. It's not *just* red to green. There must be more to the rule.
3.  **Object Identification (if applicable):** Determine if the concept of "objects" (contiguous regions of the same color) plays a role. This is an ARC prior, so it's worth considering.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Start with a basic hypothesis, test it against all examples, and refine it based on the discrepancies.
5. Document facts as YAML
6. Provide Natural Language Program

**Metrics and Observations (from prior code execution):**

-   **Example 1:** Input (3x3), Output (9x9). Output matched expectation. The rule (red becomes green, others stay the same, and each pixel expands to 3x3) worked correctly.
-   **Example 2:** Input (3x3), Output (9x9). Output *did not* match. Input grid contains a yellow (4) pixel. Output grid shows a green (3) 3x3 block. This tells us the current color conversion logic is wrong.
-   **Example 3:** Input (3x3), Output (9x9). Output *did not* match. Input had a blue (1), the output contains a red (2).

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Each pixel in the input grid is expanded into a 3x3 block in the output grid.
  - example_1:
      input_colors: [2, 0, 1]  # Red, White, Blue
      output_colors: [3, 0, 1]  # Green, White, Blue
      color_mapping_rule: |
          If the input pixel is red (2), the corresponding output block is green (3).
  - example_2:
      input_colors: [4, 0, 1]  # Yellow, White, Blue
      output_colors: [3, 0, 1]  # Green, White, Blue
      color_mapping_rule: |
          If the input pixel is yellow (4), the corresponding output block is green (3).
  - example_3:
      input_colors: [8, 0, 1] # Azure, White, Blue
      output_colors: [2, 0, 1] # Red, White, Blue
      color_mapping_rule: |
        If the input pixel is azure(8), the corresponding output block is red (2).
  - general_rule:
      input_size: 3x3
      output_size: 9x9
      expansion_factor: 3
      color_transformation: |
        The color transformation depends on the input pixel's color.
        Based on observation of each of the examples, there is a specific map
        from each input color to an output color for the 3x3 expanded block
        2 -> 3
        4 -> 3
        8 -> 2

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of pixels, where each pixel has a color value (0-9).
2.  **Expansion:** Create a 9x9 output grid. Each pixel in the input grid will correspond to a 3x3 block of pixels in the output grid.
3.  **Color Transformation**:
    - if the input pixel is Red(2), replace with Green(3)
    - if the input pixel is Yellow(4), replace with Green(3)
    - if the input pixel is Azure(8), replace with Red(2)
    - Otherwise, copy the original color value of the input pixel to all pixels within the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid.

This natural language program now correctly accounts for the observed transformations in all three training examples. The crucial change is the explicit conditional logic linking specific input colors to other specific output colors, instead of applying one blanket color swap rule for all colors.
