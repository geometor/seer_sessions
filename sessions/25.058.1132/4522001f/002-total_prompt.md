**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small input grid (3x3) into a larger output grid (9x9). The primary colors involved are green (3), white (0), and red (2).  The red pixel seems to act as a sort of "removal" signal, as it is always disappears and doesn't exist in the output. The green pixels seem to be the primary object(s) that get expanded/replicated.  The output grid is always filled; there are no empty spaces. The shape and area of the green object are what define the final pattern.

**YAML Fact Representation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: green_region
    type: contiguous_region
    color: green (3)
    initial_shape: variable # Shape can change, need to observe
    action: expands
    constraints:
      - expands to fill a quadrant based upon its initial size
    relation_to_red: "Red pixels disappear. Presence of any Red pixel causes removal of that color"

  - object: red_region
      type: contiguous_region
      color: "red (2)"
      action: removed
      constraints:
        - always a single pixel

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    property: filled entirely by either green or white

  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of green (3) and red(2) pixels within the 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Red Removal:** Note the existance/location of any red pixels and remove them from consideration for expansion.
3.  **Green Expansion:**
    *   The original 3x3 input grid is embiggened to a 9x9 grid.
    *   Imagine extending lines outwards based on the input grid borders to create quadrants in the output grid.
    *    Any area in the input grid which contains one or more green pixel expands to fully fill that region.
    *   Any green expands to fill a 3x3 block for each of the original pixel locations.
    *    Empty areas are filled with the default white.
4.  **Output:** Construct the 9x9 output grid based on the expansion rules.

Essentially - it appears to detect any green pixels and expand to a 3 x 3 block to fill out the grid created by extending lines outward from the origin input, creating 9 quadrants in the final output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
