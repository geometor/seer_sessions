observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    properties:
      - variable dimensions
      - contains regions of different colors
      - regions may have varying shapes and sizes

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    properties:
      - fixed dimensions (3x3)
      - each cell corresponds to a region in the input_grid
      - cell value represents a dominant color from the corresponding input region

  - concept: region
    definition: An area within the input grid characterized by contiguous pixels of potentially the same color. A region can be any group, they are not fixed to a size.
    properties:
      - variable size and shape
      - bounded by pixels of different colors or the grid edge

  - action: major_color_selection
    description: The process of identifying the most significant color within a region. The rules are not yet clear.
    constraints:
      - considers color frequency
      - prioritizes contiguous blocks of color
