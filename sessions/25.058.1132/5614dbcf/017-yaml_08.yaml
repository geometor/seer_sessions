facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids are always 9x9. The output grids are always 3x3.
  - object_identification: |
      The input grid contains a single non-zero pixel within either the top-center 3x3 subgrid or the bottom-center 3x3 subgrid.
  - action: |
      If a non-zero pixel exists in the top-center 3x3 subgrid, its value is copied to the (0, 1) position of the output grid.
  - action: |
      If no non-zero pixel exists in the top-center 3x3 subgrid, but one exists in the bottom-center 3x3 subgrid, its value is copied to the (2, 1) position of the output grid.
  - action: |
      All other pixels in the output grid are 0.
  - constraint:
      The position within the output grid depends on which 3x3 sub grid on the input had a non-zero value.
