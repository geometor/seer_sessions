**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller 3x3 grid (output). The input grids appear to contain multiple colored blocks, some of which have single, isolated pixels of a different color inside them. The output grid seems to select one representative pixel from certain colored blocks within the input. The background color is consistently white (0).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - size: variable
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - description: Contains multiple colored blocks
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - size: 3x3
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - description: Contains a subset of colors from the input grid.
  - object: colored_block
    type: Contiguous region
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - description: one color occupies one block.
  - relationship: input-output
    properties:
      - selection: "output grid seems to select one color per big square block"
      - background: "output grid's background is always 0"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Blocks:** Examine the input grid and identify distinct, contiguous blocks of the same color. The overall input is segmented into 3x3 regions.
2.  **Select Representative Pixel:** For each of the 3x3 regions on input, select the color that makes a square block in the input.
3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Fill each cell of the output grid with the color identified in the corresponding block of the input. If no block of a single color fills the 3x3 segment, take the color at the center. If input does not have a colored block, use the background color (0).

Essentially the input image can be divided into nine 3x3 regions, and the output is the major color for that region.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
