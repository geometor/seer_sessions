Both grids contain single-digit integer values, representing colors. The input grid has multiple colored regions (red, orange, gray), while the output grid seems to represent a highly simplified version, retaining only some of the colors from the input, and changing their positions relative to the input. It contains a red 2 and orange 7 surrounded by zeros. It appears that we are extracting and simplifying. The output grid's dimensions are 1/3 of the input grid in both dimensions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If found note the first occurrence.\n3.  **Extract:** Place the first non-zero color found at the equivalent top center position (\\[0,1]) of the output grid.\n4.  **Identify:** Now check the bottom center section.
