These regions are considered as separate objects.\n2. **Find Topmost Cell in Each Object:** For each identified object of color '8', determine the cell within that object that has the smallest row index (i.e., the topmost cell). If there are multiple cells with the same smallest row index in an object, any of them can be considered as the topmost.\n3. **Recolor Topmost Cell:** Change the color of the identified topmost cell in each '8' object from '8' (azure) to '1' (blue).\n4. **Maintain Other Cells:** Leave all other cells in the grid, including any remaining cells of color '8' and cells of other colors, unchanged.\n\nThis transformation results in the output grid where the topmost cell of each original '8' object in the input grid is replaced with color '1'."
