Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate the Red Pixel:** Find the single pixel in the input grid that has a value of 2 (red).
2.  **Preserve Colors:** Initialize the output grid as a direct copy of the input grid. All pixels, including the red one, initially retain their original colors in the output.
3. **Check Neighbors:** For the red pixel, examine its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right).
4. **Transform Adjacent Pixels:**
     * If a neighboring pixel in the input grid is white (value 0) and adjacent to the red pixel, change the value of that pixel to 1 (blue) in the output grid.
    * If a pixel is not adjacent to the red pixel, its value in the output grid remains the same as in the input grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and updated natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and generated code were a good starting point, focusing on the red pixel and its immediate neighbors. However, the tests on the subsequent training examples reveal that the transformation rule isn't solely about immediate neighbors. There's a more complex spatial relationship or "propagation" of the blue color change. The initial code *only* changes immediate white neighbors of the red pixel to blue. The other examples show that the blue extends further, suggesting a need to revise the rule to account for a connected region of white pixels. It seems the direction matters.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Failed Cases:** Carefully examine training examples where the output didn't match. Identify *how* the blue color spread beyond the immediate neighbors of the red pixel. Is it a flood fill, a directional spread, or something else?
2.  **Refine the Rule:** Modify the natural language program to accurately describe the observed spreading behavior.
3.  **Metrics and YAML:** Document the specific observations, including which pixels changed and their relationship to the red pixel.
4.   **Consider Edge Cases:** Ensure the refined description accounts for cases where the white region might be oddly shaped or touch the edges of the grid.

**Metrics and Observations (using Code Execution - conceptual, as actual execution isn't possible in this turn):**

*   **Example 1:** (Initial example, code worked correctly)
    *   Red pixel at (2, 4).
    *   Adjacent white pixels at (1, 4), (3, 4).
    *   Output: White pixels correctly changed to blue.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Red pixel at (1, 3).
    *   Adjacent white pixels at (0, 3), (2, 3). Also, (3,3) should change.
    *   Output: (0,3) and (2,3) change. (3,3) does not. **ERROR DETECTED**
*   **Example 3:**
    * Red pixel at (4,1)
    * Adjacent pixels at (3,1) (5,1). Also (2,1), (1,1) and (0,1) should be blue.
    * Output: (3,1) (5,1) changes, but not the others **ERROR DETECTED**

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example: 1
    red_pixel_location: (2, 4)
    initial_white_neighbors: [(1, 4), (3, 4)]
    final_blue_pixels: [(1, 4), (3, 4)]
    rule_followed: "Immediate white neighbors of red become blue."
    status: "success"

  - example: 2
    red_pixel_location: (1, 3)
    initial_white_neighbors: [(0, 3), (2, 3)]
    expected_blue_pixels:  [(0, 3), (2, 3), (3,3)]
    actual_blue_pixels: [(0,3), (2,3)]
    rule_followed: "Immediate white neighbors of red become blue."
    status: "failure"
    notes: The blue color should extend downward.

  - example: 3
    red_pixel_location: (4, 1)
    initial_white_neighbors: [(3, 1), (5,1)]
    expected_blue_pixels: [(3,1),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(5,1)]
    actual_blue_pixels: [(3,1), (5,1)]
    rule_followed: "Immediate white neighbors of red become blue."
    status: "failure"
    notes: The blue color should extend upward
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate the Red Pixel:** Find the single red pixel (value 2) in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Colors:** Initialize the output grid as a direct copy of the input grid.
3.  **Vertical Propagation:**
    *   Examine the pixels directly above and directly below the red pixel.
    *   If a neighboring pixel is white (value 0), change it to blue (value 1) in the output grid.
    *   Continue this process vertically:
        *   For each newly changed blue pixel, check *its* immediate neighbor directly above or below (depending on the direction of propagation - above for pixels above the red pixel, below for pixels below the red pixel).
        *    If that neighbor is white, change it to blue.
        *   Repeat until a non-white pixel or the edge of the grid is encountered.
4. **Horizontal propagation does not occur**

Essentially - it starts with immediate neighbors *above and below* the red dot. Then, extend the "bluing" vertically up and down in straight, vertical lines.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
