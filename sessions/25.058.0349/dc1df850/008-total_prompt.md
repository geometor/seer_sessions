## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x76911E9723F0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains isolated pixels of various colors (red, green, azure, and mostly black/background). The output grid seems to expand or "highlight" some of these colored pixels, particularly around a specific shape. The most notable change is an area of blue pixels.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input grid has single, isolated pixels of different colors."
    objects:
      - name: "red pixel"
        properties:
          - color: "red"
          - location: "row 7, column 3 (0-indexed)"
      - name: "green pixel"
        properties:
          - color: "green"
          - location: "row 3, column 4"
      - name: "azure pixel"
        properties:
          - color: "azure"
          - location: "row 5, column 7"
  - observation: "Output grid introduces blue (1) pixels around the red pixel"
      - name: "blue region"
        properties:
            - shape: "appears to be a 3x3 square, and 1x3 rectangle"
            - color: "blue"
  - observation: "output retains the original colored pixels"
    objects:
     - same_as_input: true
  - observation: "The red pixel at (7,2) gets a blue square around it"
    relationships:
      - "blue square surrounds red pixel"
  - observation: " The red pixel at (0,7) gets a single blue pixel to the left of it"
    relationships:
      - "blue pixel to left of red pixel."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels in the input grid that are not black (color 0).
2.  **Check** for a red (color 2) pixel in the top row.
3.  **If Found:** Create a blue (color value 1) pixel to the left of this pixel.
4. **Check** if the colored pixels are the red (2) pixel.
5.  **If Found:** create a 3x3 square of blue (color 1) pixels. The red pixel will not be a the center. The red pixel becomes part of the blue square. Place the red pixel at the center of the top edge of the square.
6. **Retain** other colored pixels and black background pixels as same location.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
