Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Locate the Red Pixel: Find the single pixel in the input grid that has a value of 2 (red).
2. Preserve Red: Copy the red pixel from the input grid to the same location in the output grid.
3. Check Neighbors: For the red pixel, examine its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right).
4. Transform Adjacent Pixels:
    *   If a neighboring pixel in the input grid has a value of 0 (white) and is directly adjacent to the red pixel, change its value to 1 (blue) in the output grid.
    *   If a pixel is not directly adjacent to the red one, keep the output value same as input.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
