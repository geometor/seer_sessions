Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Target Object:** Examine the input grid and locate the object that is gray (color value 5).

2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The height is determined by the height of the identified object. The length of the first row in output will be the length from first grey pixel to last grey pixel.

3. **Construct simplified Object:** The output grid should have two rows. The first one should have a white (0) cell between grey (5) cells. And, the length of each row corresponds to the max length of the target object.

4.  **Populate Output:** Fill all cells of the output grid with the gray color (value 5), except two white cells (value of 0) between grey cells in first row.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
