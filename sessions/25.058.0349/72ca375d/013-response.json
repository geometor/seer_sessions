The transformation seems to involve both a change in shape and, potentially, a reduction in size. The other objects in the input grid do not affect the output, so an essential part of the work is to determine how to identify the correct object.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

The length of the first row in output will be the length from first grey pixel to last grey pixel.\n\n3. **Construct simplified Object:** The output grid should have two rows. The first one should have a white (0) cell between grey (5) cells. And, the length of each row corresponds to the max length of the target object.\n\n4.  **Populate Output:** Fill all cells of the output grid with the gray color (value 5), except two white cells (value of 0) between grey cells in first row.\n\nIn summary, the transformation finds the gray object, a rectangle, and creates another 2 x N rectangle of grey color and white color in the middle in the output grid, where N corresponds to the width of the identified grey shape.\n"
