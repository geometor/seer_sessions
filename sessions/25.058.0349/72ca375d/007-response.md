Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into a smaller grid. The input grid contains several distinct colored regions (yellow, azure, and red), while the output grid consists of only one colored region (yellow). The spatial arrangement of the colored regions in the input seems crucial. The output appears to isolate a particular object based on color and possibly shape.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: yellow_square
    type: rectangle
    color: yellow
    properties:
      - size: 2x2
      - location: top_left_quadrant
    input_grid:
      rows: 10
      columns: 10
      pixels:
        - value: 0-9
          color: 0=white, 1=blue, 2=red, 3=green, 4=yellow, 5=gray, 6=magenta, 7=orange, 8=azure, 9=maroon
  - action: extract
    target: yellow_square
    result: output_grid
  - object: azure_region
    type: irregular
    color: azure
    properties:
      - size: variable
      - location: adjacent_to yellow_square
    input_grid_presence: true
    output_grid_presence: false
  - object: red_region
    type: rectangle
    color: red
    properties:
      - size: variable
      - location: bottom_quadrant
    input_grid_presence: true
    output_grid_presence: false
  - output_grid:
      rows: 2
      columns: 2

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the 2x2 yellow square object in the input grid.
2.  **Extract** the 2x2 yellow square object.
3.  The extracted square object **becomes** the output grid. All other regions are discarded.
