            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was designed to identify and extract a 2x2 yellow square. This worked perfectly for the first training example. However, the subsequent examples reveal that the rule is more specific: the target object contains a 2x2 block of yellow and the output extracts that block.\n\nThe core issue is that we added an assumption in the original program - that\nthere would only be ONE 2x2 square.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this will involve relaxing that constraint, and making\nthe program general to finding ALL 2x2 objects.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, the code's output, and whether it matched the expected output:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 9x9 grid with a single 2x2 yellow square.\n    *   Expected Output: 2x2 yellow square.\n    *   Actual Output: 2x2 yellow square.\n    *   Match: Yes.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 11x11 grid with two distinct 2x2 yellow squares.\n    *   Expected Output: 2x2 yellow square\n    *   Actual Output: One of the 2x2 squares.\n    *   Match: Yes.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 15x15 grid.  A 2x2 yellow square.  Multiple other yellow\n        objects, single and some with sizes larger than 4 pixels, but only\n        one of them.\n    *   Expected Output: 2x2 yellow square.\n    *   Actual Output: 2x2 yellow square.\n    *   Match: Yes\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_grid_size: 9x9\n      objects:\n        - color: yellow\n          shape: 2x2 square\n          count: 1\n      output_grid_size: 2x2\n      transformation: extract 2x2 square\n\n  - example_2:\n      input_grid_size: 11x11\n      objects:\n        - color: yellow\n          shape: 2x2 square\n          count: 2\n      output_grid_size: 2x2\n      transformation: extract one of the 2x2 square\n\n  - example_3:\n      input_grid_size: 15x15\n      objects:\n        - color: yellow\n          shape: 2x2 square\n          count: 1\n        - color: yellow\n          shape: other\n          count: multiple\n      output_grid_size: 2x2\n      transformation: extract 2x2 square\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  Identify all 2x2 yellow squares in the input grid.\n2.  Select any one of the 2x2 square.\n3.  Extract the selected 2x2 yellow square object.\n4.  The extracted square object becomes the output grid. All other regions are discarded.\n"
