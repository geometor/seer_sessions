## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 2 2 0 0 7 7 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 7 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x76911EBFDE50>

**output:**
```
6 6 6 6
0 6 6 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x128 at 0x76911EBFDB30>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various colored squares (represented by numbers 0-9). The output grid seems to be a highly condensed version of the input, focusing on a specific color (magenta/6) and potentially its spatial arrangement. Other colors and the background (white/0) are seemingly ignored.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [10x10] # Input grid dimensions
      elements: [0, 2, 6, 7] # Numerical representation of colors
    relations:
      - contains: objects of type 'colored_square'

  - type: colored_square
    properties:
      color: [red, magenta, orange, white] # Colors present in the input
      shape: rectangle # Observed shape of colored areas
    relations:
      - adjacency: squares of same or different color can be adjacent

  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [2x4] # Output grid dimensions
      elements: [0, 6] # Numerical representation of colors
    relations:
        - derived_from: input grid

actions:
  - type: select
    properties:
        criteria: [color=magenta(6)]
    description: Select only the magenta colored square.
  - type: crop/resize
    properties:
      dimensions: bounding box of magenta
    description: Crop to fit selected colored square
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate the largest contiguous block of magenta (color 6) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Bound:** Determine the smallest rectangular bounding box that completely encloses this magenta block.
3.  **Extract:** Extract the contents of the input grid within this bounding box.
4.  **Output:** Present the extracted sub-grid as the output. All other colors are discarded; the background from the bounding box is included.

Essentially, the transformation isolates and extracts the largest magenta-colored rectangular region from the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
