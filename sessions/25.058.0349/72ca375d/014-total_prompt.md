## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 0 0 5 0 0 5 0
0 0 3 0 0 5 5 5 5 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0
8 8 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x76911E973930>

**output:**
```
5 0 0 5
5 5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x128 at 0x76911E9723F0>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my perception of the task, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception:**

The task involves identifying a specific colored object in the input grid and extracting a transformed representation of it in the output grid. The transformation seems to involve both a change in shape and, potentially, a reduction in size. The other objects in the input grid do not affect the output, so an essential part of the work is to determine how to identify the correct object.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_dimensions: 10x10
  - output_grid_dimensions: 2x4
  - input_objects:
    - color: green (3)
      shape: irregular L-shape
      position: top-left
    - color: gray (5)
      shape: irregular shape, like 2 stacked rectangles.
      position: top-right, adjacent to green object
    - color: azure (8)
      shape: a combination of an inverted "L" shape and an additional two squares.
      position: bottom
  - output_object:
    - color: gray (5)
    - shape: rectangle
    - position: covers the entire grid
  - colors_considered: [0, 3, 5, 8]  # All colors present in input
  - output_color: gray (5)
  - transformation_type: object extraction and simplification
  - other_notes: The output appears to be a simplified, rectangular representation of the gray object in the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Object:** Examine the input grid and locate the object that is gray (color value 5).

2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The height is determined by the height of the identified object. The length of the first row in output will be the length from first grey pixel to last grey pixel.

3. **Construct simplified Object:** The output grid should have two rows. The first one should have a white (0) cell between grey (5) cells. And, the length of each row corresponds to the max length of the target object.

4.  **Populate Output:** Fill all cells of the output grid with the gray color (value 5), except two white cells (value of 0) between grey cells in first row.

In summary, the transformation finds the gray object, a rectangle, and creates another 2 x N rectangle of grey color and white color in the middle in the output grid, where N corresponds to the width of the identified grey shape.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
