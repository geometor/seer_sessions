Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on observing the first training example, which involved replicating gray pixels and creating a checkerboard pattern of azure and white. However, the subsequent training examples reveal a more nuanced rule. The checkerboard pattern isn't always present, and the replication of gray pixels seems to be context-dependent, it only occurs in certain positions related to the checkerboard. The initial hypothesis is partially correct but needs significant refinement to account for the variations in other examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I need to meticulously examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to:
    *   The presence or absence of the azure/white checkerboard.
    *   The positioning of the gray pixels and how/if they are replicated.
    *   The context of replication.

2.  **Refine Hypothesis:** Based on the detailed analysis, I'll reformulate the natural language program. The core concept seems to revolve around conditional replication and a modified checkerboard, with a more complex and potentially less uniform positioning.

3.  **Iterative Testing:** After revising the program, I'll need the updated code re-run, and test it against the examples to check if the revisions hold.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution):**

To get accurate reports, I'll describe the intended observation, and then the result of the execution will be included.

*Example 1*
```tool_code
from common import load_and_display_grid, compare_grids, load_task
task = load_task('training', 0, 0)
input_grid = task['train'][0]['input']
output_grid = task['train'][0]['output']
predicted_output = transform(np.array(input_grid))
report, success = compare_grids(output_grid, predicted_output)
print(f'{report=}')
print(f'{success=}')
load_and_display_grid(input_grid, title="Input Grid")
load_and_display_grid(output_grid, title="Expected Output Grid")
load_and_display_grid(predicted_output, title="Predicted Output Grid")
```
```tool_result
report='Mismatched elements: 3 / 36'
success=False
```

*Example 2*
```tool_code
from common import load_and_display_grid, compare_grids
task = load_task('training', 0, 0)
input_grid = task['train'][1]['input']
output_grid = task['train'][1]['output']
predicted_output = transform(np.array(input_grid))
report, success = compare_grids(output_grid, predicted_output)
print(f'{report=}')
print(f'{success=}')
load_and_display_grid(input_grid, title="Input Grid")
load_and_display_grid(output_grid, title="Expected Output Grid")
load_and_display_grid(predicted_output, title="Predicted Output Grid")
```
```tool_result
report='Mismatched elements: 1 / 36'
success=False
```
*Example 3*
```tool_code
from common import load_and_display_grid, compare_grids
task = load_task('training', 0, 0)
input_grid = task['train'][2]['input']
output_grid = task['train'][2]['output']
predicted_output = transform(np.array(input_grid))
report, success = compare_grids(output_grid, predicted_output)
print(f'{report=}')
print(f'{success=}')
load_and_display_grid(input_grid, title="Input Grid")
load_and_display_grid(output_grid, title="Expected Output Grid")
load_and_display_grid(predicted_output, title="Predicted Output Grid")
```
```tool_result
report='Mismatched elements: 3 / 100'
success=False
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double Dimensions:** Double the height and width of the input grid to create the output grid.

2.  **Conditional Gray Replication:**
    *   Iterate over all pixels of the *input* grid.
    *   If a pixel is gray, replicate it in the output grid as a 2x2 block of gray pixels, with the top-left corner of the block at the position double that of the input pixel position.

3.  **Conditional Checkerboard:**
    *   Iterate through all pixels of the *output* grid.
    *   On even-numbered rows, create a checkerboard pattern:
        *   Even-numbered columns are filled with azure.
        *   Odd-numbered columns are filled with white, unless a gray 2x2 block occupies that space, in which case leave it gray.

4. **Odd Rows**: Odd numbered rows are left as the default color (black), except
   where grey pixels occupy these cells.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
