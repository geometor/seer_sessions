## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0
0 2 0
2 4 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x76911E9AF110>

**output:**
```
4 0 4
0 2 0
2 4 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x76911E9AEC10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by integers.  I see white (0), red (2), and yellow (4). The transformation seems to involve a change in the top row.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color:
        mapping:
          0: white
          2: red
          4: yellow

observations:
  input:
    - row: 0
      values: [0, 0, 0]
    - row: 1
      values: [0, 2, 0]
    - row: 2
      values: [2, 4, 2]
  output:
     - row: 0
       values: [4, 0, 4]
     - row: 1
       values: [0, 2, 0]
     - row: 2
       values: [2, 4, 2]

changes:
    - location: top row
      before: [0, 0, 0]
      after: [4, 0, 4]

relationships:
    - type: spatial

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Context:** We have a 3x3 grid of pixels, each with a color represented by a number (0, 2, or 4).

2.  **Transformation Rule:** The top row of the grid is modified. The white pixels (0) in the top row are replaced with the color in the cell that is in the same column and the cell is not in the top row, and is furthest from the top row. If the pixel is not white then, there is no change to the top row.. Other rows are are not changed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
