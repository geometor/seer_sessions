Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are:

*   **0 (White):** Background color, seems to represent empty space.
*   **2 (Red):** Appears in the bottom two rows.
*   **4 (Yellow):** Appears in the bottom row, and moves upward.

The transformation seems to involve a selective upward movement of the yellow pixels (4) under specific conditions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: 7
      columns: 7
      cell_values: [0, 2, 4]

  - name: red_region
    type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: 2
      location: bottom two rows
      shape: rectangle like

  - name: yellow_region
    type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: 4
      location:
        input: bottom row, within the red region
        output: dispersed, two rows above, and the corner

  - name: white_region
    type: background
    properties:
      color: 0
      location: fills the rest
      shape: fill

actions:
- type: move
  target: yellow_region, corner
  properties:
      direction: up, 2 cells if original position has white above and to its sides, diagonal and two up if adjacent to whites
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the yellow (4) pixels** in the bottom row of the input grid.

2.  **Check the surroundings of the yellow pixels:**.
    *   If a yellow pixel is at the edge, and has at least two adjacent white pixels, it has moved diagonally and up 2 rows
    *    If a yellow pixel is surrounded by white cells in the row above, and to its immediate left and right, move those two rows above,

3.  **Leave all the remaining pixels (red and white)** in their original positions.

In essence, the yellow pixels within the continuous red region "jump" two rows up only if it is surrounded on its row by white pixels. The corner yellow pixels move diagonally.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
