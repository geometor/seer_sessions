The prominent colors are white (0), azure (8), and green (3).\n*   **Shapes:** There's a horizontal line of azure (8) pixels at the bottom, with a single green (3) pixel in the center of it. There are also scattered white (0) pixels.\n*    **Transformation:** The green (3) appears to have, moved, or spread, upwards, creating additional green pixels. The azure (8) remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
