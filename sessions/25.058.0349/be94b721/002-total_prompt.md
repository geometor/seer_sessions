## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=832x448 at 0x76911EBFDEF0>

**output:**
```
2 2 0
0 2 0
0 2 2
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x256 at 0x76911EBD2CB0>
Here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on elements, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another, smaller grid. The primary colors involved in this specific example are white (0), red (2), green (3), and blue (1). The input grid appears to have distinct colored regions, while the output grid focuses on a specific shape of a single color (red).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, red, green, blue]
      - dimensions: 7 x 13
      - regions:
        - color: red
          shape: irregular
          bounds: [[1,1], [4,3]] # Approximate bounding box
        - color: green
          shape: irregular
          bounds: [[1,5], [2,6]]
        - color: blue
          shape: irregular
          bounds: [[2,9], [4,11]]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, red]
      - dimensions: 4 x 3
      - regions:
        - color: red
          shape: irregular

actions:
  - type: extract
    subject: input_grid
    target: red region
    description: Isolate the red region from the input grid.
  - type: crop
    subject: red region
    description: Remove surrounding white pixels to create the output_grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains red region
  - output_grid is derived from red region
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Red Region:** Locate the contiguous region of red (2) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Extract Red Region:** Isolate this red region, discarding all other colored pixels.
3. **Crop:** remove the surrounding white space pixels and keep the largest block of red.
4.  **Form Output:** The cropped red region constitutes the output grid.

In essence, the transformation extracts and crops the largest red region in the input grid to produce the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
