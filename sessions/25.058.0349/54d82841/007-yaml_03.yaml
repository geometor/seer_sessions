objects:
  - id: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: [5, 5]
    elements: pixels

  - id: green_shape
    type: object
    color: green
    value: 3
    initial_coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,1], [1,3]]

  - id: changed_pixel
    type: pixel
    initial_color: white
    initial_value: 0
    final_color: yellow
    final_value: 4
    initial_coordinates: [4,2]
    final_coordinates: [4,2]

relationships:
    - green_shape_bounds:  The green shape defines an area within the top two rows.
    - changed_pixel_location: The changed pixel is at a row,col position at a distance from other objects

actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: unknown
    target: changed_pixel
    precondition: pixel is white,
                  pixel is at a specific location relative to the other green object
    postcondition: pixel is yellow
