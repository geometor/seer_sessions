In this specific case, the connected green pixels are in the first two rows.\n2.  **Locate Target position:** find the row index that is furthest from the green object, in this case the last row. Locate a position in the center of that row.\n3. **Change one pixel:** If a pixel's value at that location is 0 (white) and it matches the target location determined by step 2, change its value to 4 (yellow).\n4.  **Preserve the rest:** All other pixels retain their original values.\n\nIn essence, the rule seems to involve identifying a specific shape (defined by green pixels) and, based on their position, altering a single, specifically located, white pixel to yellow.\n"
