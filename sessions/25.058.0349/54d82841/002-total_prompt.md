## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x76911EE1F930>

**output:**
```
0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6

Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** An 8x8 grid. Most cells are white (0), with a cluster of magenta (6) pixels in the top-left and top-right corners.
*   **Output:** Identical to the input, *except* for two yellow (4) pixels added in the bottom row. These yellow pixels appear to be placed directly below the rightmost magenta pixel in the magenta clusters on the top two rows of magenta pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 8x8
    elements: pixels
    
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        values: [0, 6, 4]
        mapping:
          0: white
          6: magenta
          4: yellow
      position:
        type: coordinate
        x: [0-7]
        y: [0-7]

  - type: cluster
    properties:
       color: magenta
       shape: irregular
       locations:
        - top-left
        - top-right

actions:
  - type: add_pixel
    properties:
      color: yellow
      position: relative
      relative_to: rightmost magenta pixel in the top two rows
      offset:
        x: 0
        y: calculate distance to bottom row

relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: Yellow pixels are added in the last row, below the rightmost magenta pixel of the clusters in the first two rows.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Magenta Clusters:** Locate the magenta (6) pixel clusters in the input grid.
2.  **Find Rightmost Magenta Pixels:** In the clusters that exist on rows 1 and two (index 0 and 1), locate the rightmost magenta pixel in each cluster.
3. **Add the new pixels:** In the bottom row, place a yellow (4) pixel directly beneath each of those rightmost magenta pixels from the clusters on rows one and two..

Essentially, the transformation preserves the input and adds two strategically placed yellow pixels based on the position of specific magenta pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
