facts:
  - observation: "The output is always a 1D array (a single row)."
  - observation: "The output row's length matches the width of the input grid."
  - observation: "The output row always originates from the input grid."
  - observation: "The selection of the output row is directly related to the presence of blue (color 1) pixels within the rows of the input grid."
  - rule: "If a row contains at least one blue pixel, it is a candidate for the output."
  - rule: "If multiple rows contain blue pixels, any row with blue pixels could be in the output"
  - rule: "If all rows contain blue pixels, then one complete row that contains only blue pixels could be in the output"
  - question: "Is there a preference for which row is selected when multiple rows contain blue?"
