    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

    ```
*   **Output:** `[[1, 7, 0, 0, 0]]`
* **Analysis:**
    - There's one blue pixel.
    - previous code counted 7 white regions, likely due to an infinite plane
      assumption
    - We previously considered that the blue pixel, surrounded by white,
      contributed 1, but this does not explain the 7.
    - I hypothesize the output is related to counts of specific colors, *and*
      their adjacencies.
    - **Key:** The first value `1` is the single blue pixel. Let's treat that as a given.
    - **Hypothesis for 7:** Let's count the number of *rows* + *columns* in the
      input, then subtract the number of rows and columns that contain the color
      blue: (7 + 10) - (1 + 1) = 15. The number of white regions can also be found by multiplying rows with blues by columns with blues 1*1 = 1, then subtracting from the total number of cells, 70-1 = 69, and adjusting for the isolated blue 70 - 1 = 69.
    - the output width is 5

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Output:** `[[2, 7, 0, 0, 0]]`
* **Analysis:**
    - There are two blue pixels side-by-side.
    - The code correctly counted 2 blue blocks if run.
      - The number of white regions could again be found 70 - 2 = 68.
      - The output width is still 5.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

    ```
*   **Output:** `[[3, 7, 0, 0, 0]]`

* **Analysis**:
    - Three blue pixels.
    - Following previous hypothesis: the output should be `[3, 7, 0, 0, 0]`
      - The number of white regions = 70 - 3 = 67
      - the output size is fixed at 5
