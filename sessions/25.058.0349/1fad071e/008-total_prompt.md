## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 2
1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 0 2 2 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 2 2 0 0 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 2 0 1 1 0
0 1 0 2 2 0 1 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x76911EBFDB30>

**output:**
```
1 1 1 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x64 at 0x76911EBFDBD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation from a larger, multi-colored grid (input) to a smaller, simpler grid (output). The input grid contains pixels of blue (1), red (2), and white (0). The output grid seems to be a single row and contains only blue (1) and white (0) pixels. The key seems to lie in identifying and reducing the information from the input to the output. The spatial arrangement within input seems significant because the output is much smaller.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 9x9
      colors: [0, 1, 2]  # White, Blue, Red
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 1x5
      colors: [0, 1]  # White, Blue
  - observation: output_width_less_than_input
    details: The output grid's width (5) is smaller than the input grid's width (9).
  - observation: output_height_less_than_input
    details: The output grid's height (1) is smaller than the input grid's height (9).
  - observation: color_reduction
    details: The output grid only uses a subset of the colors present in the input grid.  Red is absent.
  - action: count_color_columns
    description: The number of occurrences of each color in each input column.
    parameters:
      - color: 0(white)
      - color: 1(blue)
      - color: 2(red)
  - action: column_comparison
      description: the color counts of each column are compared
  - result: output_pixel
      description: a pixel added to the output based on the count comparison

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each column of the input grid.
2.  **For each column**, count the number of blue (1) pixels.
3.  **Check** the count of blue pixels:
    *   If the count of blue pixels is greater than zero, output a blue (1) pixel.
    *   Otherwise, output a white (0) pixel.
4. The final output is a row of those output pixels.

In simpler terms - we check each column for blue, and encode the presence of blue into a 1-d row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
