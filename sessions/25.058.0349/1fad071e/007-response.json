The input grid contains pixels of blue (1), red (2), and white (0). The output grid seems to be a single row and contains only blue (1) and white (0) pixels. The key seems to lie in identifying and reducing the information from the input to the output. The spatial arrangement within input seems significant because the output is much smaller.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
