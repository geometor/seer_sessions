The input grid contains pixels of various colors represented by integers (0-9, with 0: white, 1: blue, 2: red). The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the input, focusing on specific colors or patterns. The example shows a reduction in both dimensions.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
