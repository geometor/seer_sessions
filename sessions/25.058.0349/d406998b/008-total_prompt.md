## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0
5 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 0
0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=768x192 at 0x76911EE1F930>

**output:**
```
0 3 0 3 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0
5 0 0 0 5 0 0 3 0 0 5 0
0 0 5 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 3
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids have the same dimensions (3x12). The grids contain single-digit integers, representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), gray (5), and green (3). There's a noticeable pattern of alternating gray and white pixels in the input. The output grid introduces green pixels, seemingly replacing some of the gray pixels, while others remain. The pattern change only relates to some of gray colored. The spatial arrangement remains.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x12
    elements: pixels
    colors: [0, 5] # white, gray

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x12
    elements: pixels
    colors: [0, 3, 5] # white, green, gray

  - relationship: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: Some gray pixels are replaced with green.

  - observation: spatial_consistency
    description: white pixels maintain original positions.

  - observation: conditional_color_change
    description: Only a subset of the gray pixels are changed to green
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Iteration:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.
3.  **Conditional Replacement**:
      *   If the pixel is white (0), keep it unchanged in the output grid.
      *  If a pixel is gray (5), and it is located at an even index in the overall one-dimension sequence and its row index is even, then change color to green (3) for this pixel.
      *    If the pixel is gray (5) and it is not changed, keep it gray.

In simple words:

Copy input grid to the output grid. For every even row, change every even position gray cell into a green cell.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
