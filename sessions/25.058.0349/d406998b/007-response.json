Both grids have the same dimensions (3x12). The grids contain single-digit integers, representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), gray (5), and green (3). There's a noticeable pattern of alternating gray and white pixels in the input. The output grid introduces green pixels, seemingly replacing some of the gray pixels, while others remain. The pattern change only relates to some of gray colored. The spatial arrangement remains.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
