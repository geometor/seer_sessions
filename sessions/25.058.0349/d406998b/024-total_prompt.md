Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided code, results, and a plan for improvement:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were on the right track, focusing on identifying and transforming connected gray pixels. However, the code incorrectly assumes that *any* group of connected gray pixels should be converted to green. The provided examples, especially the failures, demonstrate that only gray lines forming a continuous, unbroken path (either horizontal or vertical) should be changed. The current code's depth-first search (DFS) is too broad; it changes all connected gray pixels, even those forming shapes or branches, not just lines.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Connectedness Check:** The core issue is the `find_connected_gray_pixels` function. Instead of simply finding *all* connected gray pixels, it needs to determine if the connected pixels form a straight line (either horizontal or vertical). This requires checking the directionality of the connection.

2.  **Line Detection, Not Just Connection:** We need a mechanism to determine if the connected component forms a line.  This can be done by checking if, for every pixel in the connected component (except perhaps the endpoints), it has exactly two neighbors *within the component*.

3. **Avoid Redundant Checks** The visited check is good and prevents infinite loops

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To analyze, I'll use the provided examples (which I assume are accessible via `task.train`). I need to examine each input/output pair and compare them to the code's output.

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_metrics(task, transform_function):
    """
    Calculates and displays metrics for each example in the task's training set.

    Args:
        task: The task object containing the training examples.
        transform_function: The function that transforms the input grid.
    """
    metrics_report = []
    for example in task.train:
        input_grid = example["input"]
        expected_output_grid = example["output"]
        predicted_output_grid = transform_function(np.array(input_grid))

        # Calculate differences
        diff_grid = (np.array(expected_output_grid) != predicted_output_grid).astype(int)
        num_differences = np.sum(diff_grid)

        report = {
            "example_index": task.train.index(example),
            "input_grid_shape": np.array(input_grid).shape,
            "output_grid_shape": np.array(expected_output_grid).shape,
            "predicted_output_shape": predicted_output_grid.shape,
            "num_differences": num_differences,
            "differences_grid": diff_grid.tolist() #Convert to list for easy viewing
        }

        metrics_report.append(report)

    for report in metrics_report:
        print(f"Example {report['example_index']}:")
        print(f"  Input Shape: {report['input_grid_shape']}")
        print(f"  Output Shape: {report['output_grid_shape']}")
        print(f"  Predicted Output Shape: {report['predicted_output_shape']}")
        print(f"  Number of Differences: {report['num_differences']}")
        print(f"  Differences Grid:\n{np.array(report['differences_grid'])}") # back to numpy array for viewing
        print("-" * 20)
    return metrics_report

# Assuming 'task' and 'transform' are defined elsewhere.
metrics = calculate_metrics(task, transform)


```

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: gray_pixels
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: individually, single pixels
      - arrangement: can form lines or other shapes
    actions:
      - change_color:
          condition: gray pixels form a continuous, unbroken horizontal or vertical line
          new_color: green (3)
  - object: other_pixels
    properties:
      - color: any color other than gray
      - shape: varies
    actions:
      - remain_unchanged: color and position are preserved

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Pixels:** Iterate through the input grid, looking for gray (value 5) pixels.

2.  **Check for Line Formation:** For each gray pixel, determine if it's part of a continuous, unbroken horizontal or vertical line of gray pixels. A line is defined as follows:
    *   It consists only of gray pixels.
    *   Each pixel in the line (except potentially the endpoints) is adjacent to exactly two other gray pixels in the line. This ensures it's a straight line, not a branching structure.
    *   The line can be horizontal (all pixels have the same row index) or vertical (all pixels have the same column index).

3.  **Transform Line Pixels:** If a gray pixel is part of a valid line, change its color to green (value 3).

4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All pixels that are not part of a gray line remain unchanged (their original color is maintained).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
