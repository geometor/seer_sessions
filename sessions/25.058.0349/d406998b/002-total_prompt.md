## Example 1

**input:**
```
5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 5
0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0
0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x192 at 0x76911EE1F930>

**output:**
```
5 0 5 0 0 3 0 0 0 3
0 3 0 0 5 0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 5 0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x192 at 0x76911EE1FB10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels, where each number represents a specific color. The input grid appears to be transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions. The primary change seems to be the selective replacement of certain colors (represented by numbers) with other colors. Specifically, some of the '5' (gray) pixels are replaced by '3' (green) pixels, while others remain unchanged, and the '0' (white) remain the same. The placement of the altered pixels doesn't seem random, it seems to happen on a subset of the 5's. It appears to happen when 5 is adjacent to 0 in at least two directions.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - task_type: grid_transformation
  - grid_dimensions:
      rows: 3
      columns: 10
  - input_colors: [0, 5] # White, Gray
  - output_colors: [0, 5, 3] # White, Gray, Green
  - object_types:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          color: [integer, range(0,10)]
          position: [row, column]
  - transformations:
      - from_color: 5  #Gray
        to_color: 3   #Green
        condition: "adjacent to at least 2 '0' (white) pixels"
  - unchanged:
      - color: 0 #White

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Check** the pixel's color.
3. **IF** pixel is color '0', it is unchaged
4.  **IF** the pixel's color is '5' (gray):
    *   **Check** the colors of the adjacent pixels (up, down, left, and right). Diagonals don't seem relevant.
    *   **Count** how many adjacent pixels have the color '0' (white).
    *    **If** the count is greater than or equal to 2:
        *   **Change** the pixel's color to '3' (green).
    *   **Else**: leave pixel color.
5.  **Output** the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
