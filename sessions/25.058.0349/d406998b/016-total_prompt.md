Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt but are incomplete. The code correctly identifies the initial condition (0 adjacent to 5 on the top row) and the propagation of 3s downwards. However, it fails to capture all the nuances of the transformation, especially when multiple "seed" points (initial 3s) are created or how the propagation interacts with the 5's that appear to block propagation. The key now is to perform a close examination of *all* training examples, not just the first, to identify all conditions of the transformation.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** For *each* example, I will:
    *   Describe the input grid, noting the positions of 0s, 3s, and 5s.
    *   Describe the output grid, focusing on the changes.
    *   Compare input and output, explicitly stating *why* a 0 changed to a 3 (or didn't).
    * I will use code execution to give definitive locations, counts, sizes, and lists.
2.  **Identify All Conditions:** Based on the detailed analysis, I'll identify all the conditions under which a 0 becomes a 3. This will likely involve refining the "adjacency" rule.
3.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** I'll create a new, more precise natural language program that incorporates all identified conditions.
4.  **YAML Facts:** The YAML will be constructed based upon the example analysis.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To make this concrete, I will use code execution and print statements to get exact information from the grids. I'll analyze each example set (input and output), then summarize.

            elif grid[r, c] == 3:
                threes.append((r, c))
            elif grid[r, c] == 5:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
