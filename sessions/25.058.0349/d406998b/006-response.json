The transformation of a gray pixel to green depends on a more complex relationship with adjacent white pixels than simply counting them. It likely involves a concept of being \"enclosed\" or \"influenced\" by a specific configuration of white pixels. This configuration needs further investigation.\n3. Analyze White Pixel Context: Determine if the context of a white pixel changes its color\n4. **Transform other Pixels:** If a pixel is not a gray pixel or white pixel, it may change color based on its context.\n5. Other colors remain unchanged, except in cases described in 3 and 4\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, row, col, include_diagonal=False):\n    \"\"\"Gets the neighbors of a cell, optionally including diagonals.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for i in range(-1, 2):\n        for j in range(-1, 2):\n            if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                continue\n            if not include_diagonal and (i != 0 and j != 0):  # Skip diagonals if not included\n                continue\n            neighbor_row, neighbor_col = row + i, col + j\n            if 0 <= neighbor_row < rows and 0 <= neighbor_col < cols:\n                neighbors.append((neighbor_row, neighbor_col, grid[neighbor_row, neighbor_col]))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef analyze_gray_pixel_context(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"Analyzes the context of a gray pixel to determine if it should turn green.\"\"\"\n    neighbors = get_neighbors(grid, row, col, include_diagonal=False)\n    white_neighbors = [n for n in neighbors if n[2] == 0]\n    num_white_neighbors = len(white_neighbors)\n    \n    # Initial rule (modified):  Check for \"enclosure\"\n    if num_white_neighbors >= 2:  #At least two.  \n      #More complex check can go here (like checking relative positions, not JUST count\n      return True\n      \n    return False\n    \n\ndef analyze_white_pixel_context(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"Analyzes context of white pixel to see if it changes\"\"\"\n    # Placeholder - needs more logic based on observations from examples\n    neighbors = get_neighbors(grid, row, col)\n    \n    for r, c, color in neighbors:\n        if color == 1: # if a neighbor is blue, check for a swap\n            return 1 # turn to blue\n            \n    return 0 # default to keep it as is\n\ndef analyze_other_pixel_context(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"Analyzes the context of non-gray, non-white pixel to see if color change\"\"\"\n    neighbors = get_neighbors(grid, row, col)\n    current_color = grid[row, col]\n\n    for r, c, color in neighbors:\n      if color == 0 and current_color == 1:\n        return 0 # if current color is 1, and there is an adjacent white, turn to white\n\n    return current_color\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each pixel\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            # Analyze and transform gray pixels\n            if input_grid[row, col] == 5:\n                if analyze_gray_pixel_context(input_grid, row, col):\n                    output_grid[row, col] = 3\n            # Analyze and transform white pixels\n            elif input_grid[row, col] == 0:\n                new_color = analyze_white_pixel_context(input_grid, row, col)\n                output_grid[row,col] = new_color\n            # Analyze and potentially transform other pixels\n            else:\n              new_color = analyze_other_pixel_context(input_grid, row, col)\n              output_grid[row, col] = new_color\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
