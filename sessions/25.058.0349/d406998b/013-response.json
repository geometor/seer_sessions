Both grids have the same dimensions (3x13 in this example). The grids contain single-digit integer values, which represent colors. The primary colors involved are white (0), gray (5), and green (3). The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of some gray (5) and some white(0) pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
