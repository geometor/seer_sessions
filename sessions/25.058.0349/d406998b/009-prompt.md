Previous Code:
```python
"""
Copy input grid to the output grid. For every even row, change every even position gray cell into a green cell.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule:
    Gray pixels at even indices within even rows are changed to green.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)  # Start with a copy of the input
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Conditional Replacement
            if output_grid[i, j] == 5:  # If the pixel is gray
                if i % 2 == 0 and (i * cols + j) % 2 == 0 : # check row index and overall index
                  output_grid[i, j] = 3  # Change to green

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
