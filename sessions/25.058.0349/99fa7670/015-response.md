Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code correctly identified two key behaviors: the horizontal expansion of azure pixels and the downward-rightward expansion of gray pixels. However, the provided examples show inconsistencies. The second example input-output pair show different behavior than expected. By identifying where our assumptions break down, we can develop a more comprehensive set of rules. The strategy is to:

1.  **Verify Results**: Ensure a clear understanding of input, expected output and generated output.
2.  **Identify Discrepancies**: Pinpoint exactly where the generated output differs from the expected output.
3.  **Refine Rules**:
    *   Check if the initial assumptions about azure and gray pixel behavior hold true across *all* examples.
    *   Look for *additional* rules or conditions that might govern the transformations, especially triggered by other colors or spatial relationships.
    *   Determine the order of operations if multiple rules apply.
4.  **Update Program**: Clearly articulate the revised transformation rules in the natural language program, covering all observed behaviors.
