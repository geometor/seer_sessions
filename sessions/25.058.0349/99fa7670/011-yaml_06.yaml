example1:
  input_grid_size: 5x5
  output_grid_size: 5x5
  source_pixel:
    color: 1
    coords: (2, 2)
  changed_pixels:
    - coords: (2, 3)
      new_color: 1
    - coords: (4, 4)
      new_color: 1
  notes: The color of the pixel at (2,2) is replicated to (2,3) and (4,4)

example2:
  input_grid_size: 5x5
  output_grid_size: 5x5
  source_pixel:
      color: None
      coords: None
  changed_pixels: []
  notes: No changes are made, input and output are identical.

example3:
  input_grid_size: 7x7
  output_grid_size: 7x7
  source_pixel:
      color: None
      coords: None
  changed_pixels: []
  notes: No changes are made, input and output are identical.
