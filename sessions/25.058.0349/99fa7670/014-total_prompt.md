## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 5 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x76911E9AE170>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 8 8 8
0 0 0 0 0 8
0 0 0 0 0 8
0 0 0 5 5 5
0 0 0 0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x76912631A490>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves two 6x6 grids. The input grid contains two distinct non-zero colored pixels (azure and gray) against a background of white (zero) pixels. The output grid shows these colored regions expanded. The azure expands horizontally, filling its entire row. The gray expands, but how isn't entirely clear.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: azure_pixel
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      initial_position: [1, 1]
      type: seed
    actions:
      - expand_horizontally
  - object: gray_pixel
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      initial_position: [4, 3]
      type: seed
    actions:
      - expand_down_and_right # Unsure about exact expansion logic, need additional data
  - object: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
    actions: [] #background does nothing
  - grid: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [6, 6]
  - grid: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [6, 6]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Locate all non-zero pixels within the input grid. These are the "seed" pixels.
2.  **Horizontal Expansion (Azure):** For each seed pixel that is azure (value 8), extend it horizontally to fill the entire row it occupies in the output grid.
3. **Expansion to bottom right (Gray)**: The grey pixel seems to fill the cells down and to its right.

The program covers the main observed behavior but needs refinement when given more details.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
