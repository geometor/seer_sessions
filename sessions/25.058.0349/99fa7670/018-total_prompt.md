Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Locate all non-zero pixels within the input grid. These are the "seed" pixels.
2.  **Horizontal Expansion (Azure):** For each seed pixel that is azure (value 8), extend it horizontally to fill the entire row it occupies in the output grid.
3. **Expansion to bottom right (Gray)**: The grey pixel seems to fill the cells down and to its right, *but only if the cell to its left is also extended by the Azure rule*. It appears to be "blocked" if the condition is not met.

Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good start, capturing the basic idea of expanding azure horizontally and gray diagonally. However, the additional training examples reveal nuances and limitations in the original logic:

*   **Blocking:** The gray expansion is indeed "blocked," but the initial rule was too simplistic. It's not just about the immediate left neighbor. The blocking condition is more complex.
*   **Azure Priority:** Azure expansion appears to *always* happen, regardless of other colors. This wasn't fully clear from the first example.
*   **Multiple Gray Regions:** The original code doesn't handle cases with *disconnected* gray regions (see Train Example 3). Each gray seed pixel should initiate its *own* expansion, potentially.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I need to meticulously examine *each* input/output pair, noting:
    *   The positions of all azure and gray pixels.
    *   How far the azure expands (always to the full row).
    *   How far *each* gray region expands, and what seems to block it.
    *   Are there any other colors involved? (So far, no, but we must be sure).

2.  **Refine Blocking Rule:** The core challenge is precisely defining the gray expansion's blocking rule. It's likely related to:
    *   The presence of azure *anywhere* to the left on the same row.
    *   Potentially, the *absence* of azure above and to the left.

3.  **Independent Gray Expansions:** The code needs to treat each gray seed pixel independently. The current loop continues expansion from any previously expanded grey pixel, this is not desired behavior.

4.  **YAML and NL Program Update:** Based on the refined understanding, I'll update the YAML facts and the natural language program to be more precise and comprehensive.

**Code Execution and Metrics (Illustrative):**

I'll use `code_execution` to get exact coordinates and values, but here's the kind of analysis I'll be doing for *each* example:

**Example: Train Example 2**

```
Input:
[[0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 8 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 5 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]]
Output:
[[0 0 8 8 8]
 [0 0 8 8 8]
 [0 0 8 8 8]
 [0 5 5 5 5]
 [0 0 5 5 5]]
```

*   **Azure (8) Position:** (1, 2)
*   **Azure Expansion:** Fills row 1 completely.
*   **Gray (5) Position:** (3, 1)
*    **Gray Expansion:** Gray fills all cells to the bottom right with 5, but it appears to *only* be doing so in the rows below it and only when the entire row, up to that column, is also azure. It extends into row 4, but is "blocked" at (4,0), but not at (4,1) which has been converted to Azure by the horizontal rule.
* **Assumptions confirmed?** Yes, the horizontal Azure rule and the bottom-right Gray expansion rule, with blocking, is confirmed.

**Example: Train Example 3**

```python
Input:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 5 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 5 0]]

Output:
[[0 0 8 8 8 8]
 [0 0 8 8 8 8]
 [0 0 8 8 8 8]
 [0 5 5 5 5 5]
 [0 0 5 5 5 5]
 [0 0 0 0 5 0]]
```

*   **Azure (8) Position:** (1, 2)
*   **Azure Expansion:** Fills row 1 completely.
*   **Gray (5) Position:** (3, 1) and (5,4)
*   **Gray Expansion (3,1):** Extends to bottom right in the area that is also azure.
* **Gray Expansion (5,4):** This expansion is different - It only changes the value of the single cell.
* **Assumptions confirmed?** The result confirms the behavior of the disconnected gray regions, they should be treated as independent expansion points, not connected.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - azure (8)
        - gray (5)
      position: (row, column)  # Will be filled in dynamically for each pixel

actions:
  - name: horizontal_expansion
    object: azure pixel
    description: Expands the azure pixel to fill the entire row.
    constraints: None

  - name: diagonal_expansion
    object: gray pixel
    description: Expands the gray pixel down and to the right.
    constraints:
      - "The expansion occurs only if all cells to the left of the target cell, on the same row, are azure (8)."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Find all pixels with a value of 8 (azure) or 5 (gray).

2.  **Azure Expansion:** For *each* azure pixel, change all pixels in its row to azure.

3.  **Gray Expansion:** For *each* gray pixel, independently:
    *   Iterate through all cells at or below the gray pixel's row and at or to the right of the gray pixel's column.
    *   For each cell being considered, check if *all* cells to its left (on the same row) are azure (8).
    *   If the check in the previous step is true, change the cell's value to gray (5).
    *   If not, *do not* change the cell as part of this gray pixel's expansion.

The critical change is in step 3, explicitly stating the blocking condition for *each* gray pixel's expansion and clarifying that each gray seed pixel is independent. The previous logic continues expansion from any gray pixel that has been modified.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
