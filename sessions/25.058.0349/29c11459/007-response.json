The row containing non-zero digits in the input is transformed. The non-zero digits are expanded, and a new digit (5, representing grey) appears to separate the expansions of the original non-zero values. All other rows remain unchanged (filled with 0s).\n* **Colors:** The digits represent specific colors, making this a visual, color-based transformation. The key colors involved in the transformation are green (3), orange (7), and gray (5).\n* **Expansion:** the original colored pixels each become 5 of the same colored pixel\n* **division:** The two areas of expansions are separated by one grey (5) pixel.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
