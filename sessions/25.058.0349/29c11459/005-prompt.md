Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Find Initial Markers:** Locate the *first* occurrences of a blue pixel (1) and a red pixel (2) in the grid. These define the initial markers.
2.  **Calculate Global Midpoint:** Calculate the horizontal midpoint between the positions of these initial blue and red pixels. This midpoint will be used for all rows.
3. **Identify Target Rows:** Identify all the rows that have a blue pixel *or* a red pixel.
4. **Process Each Target Row**: For each identified row:
   - if a blue pixel exist, begin fill operation with color blue until the global midpoint - 1
   - if a red pixel exist, begin a fill operation with color red, start at global midpoint + 1
   - if both exists, still perform the respective fill operations
5.  **Place Middle Pixel:** in each target row, place a single grey pixel (5) on the global midpoint.
6.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid (those not in target rows or not within the fill ranges) retain their original colors.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
