facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x cols)
      - center: (row // 2, col // 2)
      - initial_state: input_grid values
  - object: center_pixel
    properties:
      - color: input_grid[center_row, center_col]
  - action: propagation
    description: Checkerboard pattern expanding from the center.
    details:
      - type: color_alternation
      - rule: "If the central pixel is white, propagate outwards, filling neighbors with red, maintaining the checkerboard and alternating. If the central pixel is red, propagate outwards, filling neighbors with white, maintaining the checkerboard and alternating"
