observations:
  - task: "Color Inversion (Blue and White)"
    examples:
      - input: "10x10 grid with white and blue pixels. Blue pixels form a 2x2 square in the center."
        output: "10x10 grid with blue and white pixels. White pixels form a 2x2 square in the center, inverted colors from input."
        action: "Invert colors: blue (1) becomes white (0), white (0) becomes blue (1)."
        result: "Correct"
      - input: "10x10 grid. Blue pixels are present in a different configuration (two rows)."
        output: "10x10 grid with colors inverted, matching the input configuration."
        action: "Invert colors: blue (1) becomes white (0), white (0) becomes blue (1)."
        result: "Correct"
      - input: "10x10 grid, with blue forming a 4x2 rectangle."
        output: "10x10, with white forming a 4x2 rectangle, inverted colors from the input."
        action: "Invert colors: blue (1) becomes white (0), white (0) becomes blue (1)."
        result: "Correct"
    overall_rule: "Invert the colors of the input grid, swapping blue and white pixels.  Other colors are unchanged."
