The transformation seems to involve an expansion or propagation of the white pixel, creating a cross or plus-shaped pattern of white pixels centered on the original white pixel. The green pixels at the corners of the grid remain, but the green pixels adjacent to the expanding white area change into white pixels.  The final output has a symmetric cross of white cells on a field of green.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
