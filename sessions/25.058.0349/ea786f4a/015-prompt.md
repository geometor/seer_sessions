Previous Code:
```python
"""
Finds the single white pixel in the input grid, then changes all pixels in its row and column to white.
"""

import numpy as np

    if len(rows) > 0:  # Check if a white pixel was found
        return rows[0], cols[0]
    return None  # Return None if no white pixel is found

    """
    Transforms the input grid by changing the color of pixels in the same row and column
    as the initial white pixel to white.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
