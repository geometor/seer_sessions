## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x76911E9AEB70>

**output:**
```
0 1 0
1 0 1
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x76911E9AE170>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of pixels. Each pixel has a single integer value, which corresponds to a color. The transformation seems to involve changing the color of certain pixels based on their initial color and potentially their position. The primary colors involved appear to be blue (1) and white (0).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - name: color
        values: [0, 1]  # white, blue

actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: system
    parameters:
      - original_color
      - new_color
      - location

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: pixels are arranged in a 2D grid
    elements:
      - pixel
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels with the color blue (value 1) in the input grid.
2.  **Change** the color of these identified blue pixels to white (value 0).
3.  **Identify** all pixels with the color white (value 0) in the input grid.
4.  **Change** the color of the identified white pixels to Blue (value 1).
5. **Return** all other pixels without changes.

In simple words, the program is inverting the colors of input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
