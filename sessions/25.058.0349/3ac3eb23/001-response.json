The input grid transforms into a modified output grid. The primary change appears to be the replication of certain non-zero values. Specifically, the '2' (red) and '8' (azure) values in the top row of the input seem to be influencing the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Note the positions and values of cells containing '2' (red) or '8' (azure).\n\n2.  **Replicate Downward:** For each identified cell in step 1:\n    *   If the cell's value is '2', replicate this value in the same column in every even-numbered row (starting from row 2, which would be index=1 ).\n    *   If the cell's value is '8', replicate this value in the same column in every even-numbered row (starting from row 2, which would be index=1).\n\n3. **Other values:** All the other positions in the array are filled with `0`.\n\nIn essence, the program takes the '2' and '8' values from the top row and propagates them downwards in their respective columns, but only on every other row, starting at the second one (index=1). The rest of the cells are filled with zeros.\n"
