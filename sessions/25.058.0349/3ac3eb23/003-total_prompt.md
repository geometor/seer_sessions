Previous Code:
```python
"""
Takes the '2' and '8' values from the top row and propagates them downwards 
in their respective columns, but only on every other row, starting at the 
second one (index=1). The rest of the cells are filled with zeros.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule.
    """
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through the first row to find source cells (2 and 8)
    for j in range(cols):
        if input_grid[0, j] == 2 or input_grid[0, j] == 8:
            source_value = input_grid[0, j]
            # Replicate the source value downward in alternating rows
            for i in range(rows):
                output_grid[0,j] = input_grid[0,j] # same as input
                if i % 2 == 1 :
                    output_grid[i, j] = source_value

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
