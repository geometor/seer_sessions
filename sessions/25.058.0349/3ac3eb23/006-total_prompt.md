Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation identifies '2' and '8' values in the first row of the input grid.  It replicates these values in the same columns in the output grid, but only in the second row (index 1). The rest of the cells in the output are filled with zeros. The first row of the output is a copy of the input's first row.

def transform(input_grid):

    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Copy the first row from input to output

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, which led to an oversimplified rule. The code correctly handles the first example but fails on others. The core issue is that the initial program assumed that *only* the values '2' and '8' in the first row are replicated in the second, and the entire first row is always copied. The other examples demonstrate more complex rules about which numbers in the input grid propagate to the output grid. We need to generalize the rule to account for cases that don't involve copying the first row, or require selecting the second row or even other cells of the input grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Examine all examples:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair in the training set to identify the *actual* transformation rule. Pay close attention to which cells are copied, modified, or set to zero, and under what conditions.
2.  **Identify common patterns:** Look for consistent rules that apply across *all* examples, not just the first one.
3.  **Refine the natural language program:** Update the description to accurately and completely capture the observed transformation.
4.  **Update the reports:** Make sure each of the deliverables are updated with the new information.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To better understand the transformation, let's examine more closely what happens, using a small python script to provide metrics.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_transformation(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_output_grid):

    predicted_output_grid = np.array(predicted_output_grid)

    print("Input Grid:")
    print(input_grid)
    print("Expected Output Grid:")
    print(output_grid)
    print("Predicted Output Grid:")
    print(predicted_output_grid)    

    correct = np.array_equal(output_grid, predicted_output_grid)
    print(f"Correct: {correct}")

    diff = output_grid - predicted_output_grid
    print("Difference (Expected - Predicted):")
    print(diff)    

    input_values = np.unique(input_grid)
    output_values = np.unique(output_grid)
    print(f"Unique Input Values: {input_values}")
    print(f"Unique Output Values: {output_values}")

        if input_grid[0, j] == 2 or input_grid[0, j] == 8:
            source_value = input_grid[0, j]
            # Replicate the source value in the second row (index 1)

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  Copy the first row of the input grid to the first row of the output grid.
2.  If the input grid has a second row, copy the second row of the input grid to the second row of the output grid.
    If any elements from the first row of the input grid are 2 or 8, and the grid has a second row, those elements are also copied to the second row, maintaining the column index. If an element is not copied from the first row, its value is set to zero. If there is no second row, or if the second row does not exist, skip this step
3. Set all cells in the third row, and all other rows of the output grid to 0.

This revised program captures the behavior observed in all three training examples. It correctly copies the first row, selectively copies or clears the second, and clears all subsequent rows.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
