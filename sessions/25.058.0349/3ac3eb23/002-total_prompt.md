## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 2 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x384 at 0x76911E9AF7F0>

**output:**
```
0 2 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0
2 0 2 0 8 0 8 0 0 0
0 2 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0
2 0 2 0 8 0 8 0 0 0
0 2 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0
2 0 2 0 8 0 8 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid (likely 2D array) of numerical values, where each number represents a color. The input grid transforms into a modified output grid. The primary change appears to be the replication of certain non-zero values. Specifically, the '2' (red) and '8' (azure) values in the top row of the input seem to be influencing the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D arrays of integers representing colors.
  - object: cell
    properties:
      value: integer (0-9)
      color: derived from value (e.g., 0=white, 2=red, 8=azure)
      position: (row, column) index
  - observation: replication
    description: Certain cell values in the input are replicated in a pattern in the output.
  - pattern: vertical_alternating
    source_row: 0 # top row of the array
    source_values: [2, 8]
    description:  Values 2 and 8 from the first row are repeated in alternating rows directly below their original position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Source Cells:** Examine the first row (row 0) of the input grid. Note the positions and values of cells containing '2' (red) or '8' (azure).

2.  **Replicate Downward:** For each identified cell in step 1:
    *   If the cell's value is '2', replicate this value in the same column in every even-numbered row (starting from row 2, which would be index=1 ).
    *   If the cell's value is '8', replicate this value in the same column in every even-numbered row (starting from row 2, which would be index=1).

3. **Other values:** All the other positions in the array are filled with `0`.

In essence, the program takes the '2' and '8' values from the top row and propagates them downwards in their respective columns, but only on every other row, starting at the second one (index=1). The rest of the cells are filled with zeros.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
