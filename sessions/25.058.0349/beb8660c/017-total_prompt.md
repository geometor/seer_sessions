    return f"Grid: {grid.tolist()}, Shape: {grid.shape}"

    for i, example in enumerate(examples):

        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a refined natural language program and supporting documentation.

**General Assessment:**

The initial attempt at a transformation function (swapping elements in a 2x2 subgrid) only works for the first example and fails for the rest. This indicates that the initial hypothesis was too narrow and didn't capture the general rule governing the transformations. The strategy now is to:

1.  Carefully examine *all* provided examples, including the ones where the previous code failed.
2.  Identify common patterns and relationships between the input and output grids *across all examples*.
3.  Develop a new natural language program that accurately describes the transformation observed in *all* examples.
4. Refine Facts in YAML format

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution Simulation):**

Since I can't directly execute code, I'll simulate the execution and provide the expected output based on manual analysis of the provided `analysis_results`.

*   **Example 0:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 2)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 2)
    *   Transformation Match: True
    *   Observation: first two rows swap first column values
*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Transformation Match: False
    *    Observation: first two rows swap first and second values
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (4, 2)
    *   Output Shape: (4, 2)
    *   Transformation Match: True
       * Observation: first two rows swap first column values
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 4)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 4)
    *   Transformation Match: False
    * Observation: first two rows have the first two values in the columns swap.

Based on observation it look like the first two row swap their column 0 and 1 values

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - category: observation
    description: The transformation involves swapping elements within the input grid.
  - category: constraint
    description: The swapping operation is constrained to specific elements, not the entire grid.
  - category: input
    grid: 2D array of integers
    shape: rows x cols
    elements: integers from 0 to 9 representing colors.
  - category: output
    grid: 2D array of integers
    shape: matches input shape in all examples
    elements: integers from 0 to 9 representing colors
  - category: transformation
    description: The first two rows swap positions of column 0 and column 1.
  - category: location
    description: first two rows
    indexes: 0,1
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Focus on the first two rows of the input grid.
2.  **Swap:** column 0 swaps with column 1 in the first two rows.
3. **Copy Rest:** All other rows and columns maintain the same values as the input
4.  **Output:** Create the output grid with the swapped elements.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
