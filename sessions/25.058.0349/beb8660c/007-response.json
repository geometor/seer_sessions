The input and output grids have the same dimensions (7x4). There are several distinct colored objects (contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color) present: blue (1), red (2), green (3), and azure (8). White (0) appears to be the background. The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement of these colored objects.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Treat white as the background.\n2.  **Vertical Sorting/Rearrangement**: Sorts the rows. It take the object in a row and move to the buttom in a descending order.\n    *   The blue object (row 1) is moved down three rows.\n    *   The red object's row (row 3) is moved down three rows.\n    *   The green object's row (row 5) is moved down one row.\n    *   The azure object's row stays on the bottom(row 7) of the grid.\n\nIn summary, the transformation involves a specific vertical rearrangement of the rows containing the colored objects. It's a form of vertical shifting, where objects are maintaining their internal shape, but being moved down to be positioned as lowest as possible in the new array.\n"
