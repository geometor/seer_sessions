            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a refined natural language program and supporting documentation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial attempt at a transformation function (swapping elements in a 2x2 subgrid) only works for the first example and fails for the rest. This indicates that the initial hypothesis was too narrow and didn't capture the general rule governing the transformations. The strategy now is to:\n\n1.  Carefully examine *all* provided examples, including the ones where the previous code failed.\n2.  Identify common patterns and relationships between the input and output grids *across all examples*.\n3.  Develop a new natural language program that accurately describes the transformation observed in *all* examples.\n4. Refine Facts in YAML format\n\n**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution Simulation):**\n\nSince I can't directly execute code, I'll simulate the execution and provide the expected output based on manual analysis of the provided `analysis_results`.\n\n*   **Example 0:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 2)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 2)\n    *   Transformation Match: True\n    *   Observation: first two rows swap first column values\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Transformation Match: False\n    *    Observation: first two rows swap first and second values\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 2)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 2)\n    *   Transformation Match: True\n       * Observation: first two rows swap first column values\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 4)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 4)\n    *   Transformation Match: False\n    * Observation: first two rows have the first two values in the columns swap.\n\nBased on observation it look like the first two row swap their column 0 and 1 values\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - category: observation\n    description: The transformation involves swapping elements within the input grid.\n  - category: constraint\n    description: The swapping operation is constrained to specific elements, not the entire grid.\n  - category: input\n    grid: 2D array of integers\n    shape: rows x cols\n    elements: integers from 0 to 9 representing colors.\n  - category: output\n    grid: 2D array of integers\n    shape: matches input shape in all examples\n    elements: integers from 0 to 9 representing colors\n  - category: transformation\n    description: The first two rows swap positions of column 0 and column 1.\n  - category: location\n    description: first two rows\n    indexes: 0,1\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify:** Focus on the first two rows of the input grid.\n2.  **Swap:** column 0 swaps with column 1 in the first two rows.\n3. **Copy Rest:** All other rows and columns maintain the same values as the input\n4.  **Output:** Create the output grid with the swapped elements.\n"
