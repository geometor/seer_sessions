The input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x7). The colored bars appear to be \"sliding\" or shifting positions, but their lengths and colors remain constant. The order of the bars seems to change, and their final position in the output grid aligns with the right edge. The transformation is likely based on sorting or reordering these colored bars based on their colors or some other inherent property.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

A horizontal bar is defined as a contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color in a single row.\n2.  **Extract Properties:** For each bar, record its color, length, and starting row position.\n3.  **Reorder Bars:** Sort the bars based on their original row position, so bars higher on the image are processed first.\n4.  **Reposition Bars:** In the output grid, place each bar, in their sorted order, starting from the top row, and align it to the right edge of the grid. Keep the original lengths and colors. Leave empty cells as color 0.\n\nEssentially, the transformation takes horizontal bars of varying colors and lengths from the input, reorders them according to their appearance (top to bottom), and places them in the output grid right-aligned, maintaining their original color and length.\n"
