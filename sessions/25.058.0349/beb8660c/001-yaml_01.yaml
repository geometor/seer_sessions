objects:
  - type: horizontal_bar
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - length: integer (number of contiguous pixels of the same color)
      - position: (row, start_column, end_column)
    instances:
      - {color: 2, length: 2, position: (0, 1, 2)}
      - {color: 3, length: 1, position: (1, 4, 4)}
      - {color: 1, length: 3, position: (2, 0, 2)}
      - {color: 5, length: 6, position: (4, 1, 6)}
      - {color: 6, length: 5, position: (6, 0, 4)}
      - {color: 4, length: 4, position: (7, 3, 6)}
      - {color: 8, length: 7, position: (9, 0, 6)}

actions:
  - type: reorder
    description: Reorders the horizontal bars based on an observed rule
    parameters:
        - sort_key:  A derived characteristic to establish order of the blocks.

  - type: reposition
    description: Moves bars to new positions in the output grid

relationships:
   - input_output_grid_size_invariant: "Input and output grids have identical dimensions"
   - bar_properties_preserved: "Color and length of each bar are maintained during transformation"
   - bar_order_changed: "The vertical order of the bars is modified in the output."
   - bar_right_aligned: "Bars align to the right edge in the output."
