## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
2 2 2 0
0 0 0 0
0 3 3 0
0 0 0 0
8 8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x448 at 0x76911EB26350>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 3 3
0 2 2 2
8 8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x448 at 0x76911EB263F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (7x4). There are several distinct colored objects (contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color) present: blue (1), red (2), green (3), and azure (8). White (0) appears to be the background. The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement of these colored objects.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - color: blue (1)
    initial_position: [0, 3]  # row, column
    shape: single pixel
  - color: red (2)
    initial_position: [2, 0:2]  # row, column slice
    shape: horizontal line of 3 pixels
  - color: green (3)
    initial_position: [4, 1:2]  # row, column slice
    shape: horizontal line of 2 pixels
  - color: azure (8)
    initial_position: [6, 0:3]  # row, column slice
    shape: horizontal line of 4 pixels
  - color: white(0)
    initial_position: all the reset of cells
    shape: background

actions:
  - type: object_transposition
    description: Objects are moved to different locations within the grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The relative positions of the objects change. It is like a vertical shift and the rows are re-arranged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Recognize the distinct colored objects (blue, red, green, and azure) within the grid. Treat white as the background.
2.  **Vertical Sorting/Rearrangement**: Sorts the rows. It take the object in a row and move to the buttom in a descending order.
    *   The blue object (row 1) is moved down three rows.
    *   The red object's row (row 3) is moved down three rows.
    *   The green object's row (row 5) is moved down one row.
    *   The azure object's row stays on the bottom(row 7) of the grid.

In summary, the transformation involves a specific vertical rearrangement of the rows containing the colored objects. It's a form of vertical shifting, where objects are maintaining their internal shape, but being moved down to be positioned as lowest as possible in the new array.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
