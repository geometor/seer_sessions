The primary colors observed are red (2) and white (0). The transformation introduces a new color, yellow (4). The yellow pixels seem to be related to the positions of the red pixels, but not in a simple mirroring or shifting way. The overall grid dimensions remain constant. It appears as though the yellow color fills specific regions based on the relative position of red pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
