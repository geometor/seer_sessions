The colors involved are primarily white (0) and red (2), with the introduction of yellow (4) in the output. The spatial arrangement of the red pixels seems to influence the placement of yellow pixels. Specifically, it appears that solid, contiguous blocks of red trigger changes, while interspersed reds may not, and yellow fills the same shape, like a flood-fill constrained to a region.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
