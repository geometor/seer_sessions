Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Regions:** Scan the input grid and identify all contiguous regions of red (2) pixels. A region is defined as a group of horizontally or vertically adjacent pixels of the same color.
2.  **Filter large regions:** Keep regions of red pixels that contains 3 or more pixels.
3.  **Fill with Yellow:** For each region identified above, change the color of those pixels to yellow (4) in the output grid.
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the input grid that are not part of a large red region retain their original color in the output grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
