Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Scan the input grid and identify all pixels that are red (color value 2).
2.  **Classify Red Pixels**: Determine if each red pixel is either *isolated* (not horizontally or vertically adjacent to any other red pixel) or a *region member* (part of a contiguous group of 3 or more red pixels, connected horizontally or vertically).
3.  **Transform Regions**: Change the color of red pixels that are *region members* to yellow (color value 4).
4. **Preserve other pixels**: Maintain original colors of all other colors as well as isolated red pixels.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
