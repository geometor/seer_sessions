## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=960x192 at 0x76911E9AF110>

**output:**
```
2 0 0 0 2 4 4 4 2 0 0 0 2 0 0
4 2 0 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 0 2 4 2 0
4 4 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 4 4 4 2
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are red (2) and white (0). The transformation introduces a new color, yellow (4). The yellow pixels seem to be related to the positions of the red pixels, but not in a simple mirroring or shifting way. The overall grid dimensions remain constant. It appears as though the yellow color fills specific regions based on the relative position of red pixels.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - red (2)
        - white (0)
        - yellow (4)
      position: [row, column]
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels can be horizontally or vertically adjacent.
  - type: containment
    description: red pixels define areas
actions:
    - type: fill
      description: fill the positions between the red pixels with yellow, but with some conditions
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color red (value 2) in the input grid.

2.  **Conditional Horizontal Filling:** For each row, examine pairs of red pixels.
    *   If a red pixel in the pair can be identified as a "right" pixel based on its relative position in the row, then fill all white pixels in that row up to three positions right of that pixel with yellow.
        *   If there are red pixels to the right of the changed pixels, they are also changed to yellow.
    *   If a red pixel in the pair can be identified as a "left" pixel based on its relative position in the row, then fill all white pixels in that row up to three positions left of that pixel with yellow.
            *   If there are red pixels to the left of the changed pixels, they are also changed to yellow.

3. **Conditional Vertical Filling** For each column, examine pairs of red pixels
    *    If a red pixel in the pair can be identified as a "top" pixel based on its relative position in the column, then fill all white pixels in that column up to three positions below that pixel with yellow.
        *   If there are red pixels below the changed pixels, they are also changed to yellow.
    *   If a red pixel in the pair can be identified as a "bottom" pixel based on its relative position in the column, then fill all white pixels in that column up to three positions up of that pixel with yellow.
        *   If there are red pixels above the changed pixels, they are also changed to yellow.
4.  **Preserve Reds:** The original red pixels in positions without a yellow fill remain red in the output grid.

In short the natural language program would involve first identifying red pixels and using those red pixels as origins for generating the positions of yellow pixels.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
