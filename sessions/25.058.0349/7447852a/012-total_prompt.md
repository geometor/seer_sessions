Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Regions:** Locate all pixels with the color red (value 2) in the input grid. These pixels define the starting points for the filling operation.

2.  **Flood Fill with Constraints:** For each red pixel, initiate a flood fill operation with yellow (value 4). This fill should extend in all eight directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).

3.  **Filling Constraint:** During the fill, only replace pixels that are white (0) or red (2). If a pixel of any other color is encountered, the fill stops in that direction. The fill will naturally connect red regions because it extends in all directions until obstructed.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code correctly identified the core concept of flood-filling from red pixels with yellow. However, the results across multiple training examples reveal some limitations, it correctly connects the separated red clusters as single objects. The primary issue seems that the floodfill does not always stop at every non-white or non-red pixel.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to where the flood fill *should* have stopped but didn't, and vice-versa.
2.  **Refine Constraint Logic:** The natural language program needs to be more precise about the stopping conditions. We will examine all the given examples and develop metrics that help to understand when the fill continues and when it stops.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**
The code has run on all the training data with these results:
```python

    """

    Args:

        - A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a differing cell
          and contains: (row_index, col_index, value_in_grid1, value_in_grid2)

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task: flood_fill_red_with_yellow
objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - name: red_pixel
    properties:
      - color: red (value 2)
      - role: starting point for flood fill
  - name: yellow_pixel
    properties:
      - color: yellow (value 4)
      - role: fill color
  - name: white_pixel
    properties:
      - color: white
      - role: can be filled

actions:
  - name: flood_fill
    input: grid, red_pixel
    output: modified grid
    constraints:
      - fill_color: yellow
      - fill_directions: all eight (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
      - stop_condition:  pixel is not white (0) or red (2)
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Red Pixels:** Identify all pixels colored red (value 2) within the input grid.

2.  **Initiate Flood Fill:** For each red pixel, perform a flood fill operation using yellow (value 4).

3.  **Fill Propagation:** The flood fill extends outwards from the starting red pixel in all eight directions: horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

4.  **Fill Termination:** The flood fill in a given direction stops when it encounters a pixel that is not colored white (0) or red (2).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
