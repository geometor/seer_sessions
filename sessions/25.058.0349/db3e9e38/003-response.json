            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved surrounding an orange vertical line with azure. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this rule isn't universally applicable. Specifically, Example 2 has an orange L shape which the function did not find the surrounding pixels for. Example 3 also shows a similar behavior. It seems the core concept of \"surrounding a shape\" is correct, but the method of finding and surrounding a *vertical line* is too specific. The shape can be different. We need a more general approach to detecting the target object (orange pixels) and surrounding them.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the discrepancies between the expected output and the output produced by the current code:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Orange vertical line.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Orange line surrounded by azure.\n    *   **Actual Output:** Orange line surrounded by azure.\n    *   **Assessment:** Correct. The initial code works as expected for this case.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Orange \"L\" shape.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Orange \"L\" shape surrounded by azure.\n    *   **Actual Output:** partial surrounding.\n    *   **Assessment:** Incorrect. The code only surrounds the vertical part of the \"L\", not the entire shape.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    **Input:** two orange pixels.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Orange pixels surrounded by azure.\n    *   **Actual Output:** partial surrounding.\n    *   **Assessment:** Incorrect. The code only surrounds, the vertical, and not all parts.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_1:\n      input_object: Orange vertical line.\n      action: Surround with azure.\n      output_object: Orange vertical line surrounded by azure.\n      result: correct\n  - example_2:\n      input_object: Orange L shape.\n      action: Surround with azure.\n      output_object: Orange L shape surrounded by azure.\n      result: incorrect\n  - example_3:\n      input_object: two orange pixels, placed vertically.\n      action: Surround with azure\n      output_object: orange pixels surrounded by azure\n      result: incorrect\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate all orange (7) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Surround with Azure:** For each orange (7) pixel:\n    a. Change any directly adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right, and diagonal) to azure (8).\n3.  **Wrap around:** If an orange pixel touches the edge of the grid, extend the surrounding azure color to the opposite side of the grid as needed.\n"
