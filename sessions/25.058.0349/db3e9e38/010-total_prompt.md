Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms an input grid with a vertical orange line into an output grid with an expanded pattern of orange and azure pixels. 
The transformation creates a checkered pattern of orange and azure, originating from the orange line in the input grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the observed pattern.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)  # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through the grid
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            # Check for orange pixels
            if input_grid[r, c] == 7:
                output_grid[r,c] = 7
                # Check if right neighbor is within bounds and white
                if c + 1 < cols and input_grid[r, c + 1] == 0:
                        output_grid[r, c + 1] = 8  # change to azure

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code and results to refine the natural language program and address the discrepancies.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies the orange line and attempts to initiate the pattern expansion. However, it only expands one step to the right, filling the immediate right neighbor with azure if it's white. It doesn't implement a full checkered pattern expansion, nor does it handle variations in the position of the initial orange line. The provided training results will reveal more.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine each input/output/predicted output triplet. Quantify the differences between the predicted and expected outputs. Determine which aspects of the pattern are correct and which are not.
2.  **Identify Pattern Properties:** Define the full properties of the checkered pattern. This includes its origin (the orange line), the alternating colors (orange and azure), and the extent of its spread (how many cells in each direction).
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the error analysis and pattern properties, rewrite the natural language program to accurately capture the complete transformation.
4.   **Use Code to Validate:**  I'll use a `code_execution` call with python to compare the provided output grid with the result of running the transform function on the input. This will help quantify the number of matching pixels.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

I'll use the example information in the prompt to perform calculations using python.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
