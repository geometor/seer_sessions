Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 6x6 grid, and the output is a 2x2 grid. The input grid contains various colors, while the output grid seems to be a highly simplified version, retaining only certain colors and seemingly discarding the rest. The most obvious visual distinction is size. The input has cells filled in with blue (1) that seem to be irrelevant. The output only includes corner cells with unique colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: varied (0-9)
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 2x2
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: varied (subset of input_grid colors)

actions:
  - type: selection
    description: Select specific pixels from the input grid.
  - type: reduction
    description: Reduce the input grid to a smaller output grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid: contains all colors present in output_grid
  - output_grid: is a subset of input_grid, preserving the spatial arrangement of the extreme corner elements in the source.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Corner Pixels:** Locate the four corner pixels (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) in the original 6X6 input image, that do not match the predominant background fill color.
2.  **Extract Colors:** Extract only corner colors.
3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 2x2 output grid.
4. **Fill:** Fill the 2X2 grid using the non-background colors of the corresponding input corners. maintain the position of the original corner pixels.

In essence, the transformation extracts the top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right pixel values, that do not match the background, from the input grid and places them in a 2x2 output grid, maintaining their original relative positions.
