facts:
  - observation: Input is a grid of 8x8 pixels.
  - observation: Output is a grid of 4x4 pixels.
  - observation: Input grid has a prominent blue (1) border.
  - observation: The blue border fully encloses other colors.
  - observation: Output grid contains colors from the input grid, excluding blue (1) and white (0).
  - observation: Output grid's colored pixels correspond to the corner pixels of colored regions inside the blue border in the Input grid.
  - observation: Corners are judged by the boundaries made by non-blue and non-white pixels.
  - property: Colors represent pixel values.
  - property: Grid dimensions are different between input and output.
  - action: Extraction of corner pixel colors.
  - action: Repositioning of extracted colors in a smaller grid.
  - relationship: Input grid pixels map to output grid pixels based on position and color, specifically corner locations.
