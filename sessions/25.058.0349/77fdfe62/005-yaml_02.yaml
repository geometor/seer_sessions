objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9] # Represents different colors
      - dimensions: variable (up to 30x30)

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - dimensions: 4x4

  - name: non_white_blocks
    type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: non-zero integer
      - shape: rectangular (in these examples)
      - position: row and column index in input_grid

actions:
  - name: extract_blocks
    description: Identify contiguous blocks of non-white pixels within the input grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: list of non_white_blocks

  - name: order_blocks
    description: Order the extracted blocks based on their top-left pixel position, reading from top to bottom and left to right.
    input: list of non_white_blocks
    output: ordered list of non_white_blocks

  - name: populate_output
    description: Fill the 4x4 output grid with the colors of the ordered blocks.
    input: ordered list of non_white_blocks, output_grid
    output: populated output_grid
    rules:
      - Iterate through blocks from first to last.
      - For each block iterate the pixels in the block.
      - Fill the cells of the output_grid from top-left, row by row, with the color of the pixel.
      - If the output_grid is full, stop. If all the block pixels are placed, fill the remaining cells of the output grid with white (0).
