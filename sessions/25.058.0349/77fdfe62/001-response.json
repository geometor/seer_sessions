The colors (represented by numbers) in the input grid seem to be selectively extracted and repositioned in the output grid. The input grid contains a large, contiguous \"frame\" of blue (1) pixels.  The output grid appears to sample pixels from only the corners of the object formed by the non-blue pixels within the frame.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

A \"corner\" means a colored pixel, which is *not* white or blue that makes a corner when considering all non-white and non-blue regions, and that are adjacent to either a white or blue.\n\n3. **Sample corner pixels in clockwise order:** The corners define an ordered set of pixels, starting at the top-left, then top-right, bottom-right and finally bottom-left\n\n4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 4x4 output grid.\n\n5.  **Place Extracted Colors:** Populate the output grid in the order with values identified earlier:\n    *   Top-left corner color goes to output grid (0,1).\n    *   Top-right corner color goes to output grid (1,3).\n    *    Bottom-right corner color goes to output grid (2,2).\n    *   Bottom-left corner color goes to output grid (3,0).\n    *   If multiple, adjacent, corner colors are identified, perform this same action to adjacent cells in the output grid, starting with the positions described.\n6. **Fill:** Fill the remaining cells of the output grid with 0 (white).\n\n"
