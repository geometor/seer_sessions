A block is defined as a rectangular region of pixels of the same color.\n2.  **Order Blocks:** Order the identified blocks. Ordering is done based on the position of the block within the input grid, reading the input grid in a standard raster scan (from top to bottom, and within each row, from left to right). Use the top-left pixel of a block as the block position.\n3.  **Create Output Grid:** Prepare a 4x4 output grid, initially filled with white (0).\n4.  **Populate Output Grid:** Fill the output grid with colors from the ordered blocks.\n    *   Start at the top-left cell (0, 0) of the output grid.\n    *   Iterate through the non-white blocks in order.\n    *   Iterate the pixels of a block, taking the colors row by row, left to right.\n    * Place the pixel color into the output grid moving from left-to-right, top-to-bottom\n    *   If the output grid is full, stop populating.\n    *   If all non-white pixels have been placed, complete filling the rest of the output grid with 0.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_blocks(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous blocks of non-white pixels in a grid.\"\"\"\n    blocks = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and (r, c) not in visited:\n                block_color = grid[r, c]\n                block = []\n                queue = [(r, c)]\n                visited.add((r, c))\n                while queue:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = queue.pop(0)\n                    block.append((curr_r, curr_c, block_color))\n                    # Check adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)\n                    neighbors = [(curr_r - 1, curr_c), (curr_r + 1, curr_c),\n                                 (curr_r, curr_c - 1), (curr_r, curr_c + 1)]\n                    for nr, nc in neighbors:\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == block_color and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                            queue.append((nr, nc))\n                            visited.add((nr, nc))\n                blocks.append(block)\n    return blocks\n\ndef order_blocks(blocks):\n    \"\"\"Orders blocks based on the top-left pixel's position (raster-scan order).\"\"\"\n    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (block[0][0], block[0][1]))\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.zeros((4, 4), dtype=int)\n\n    # Find and order blocks\n    blocks = find_blocks(input_grid)\n    ordered_blocks = order_blocks(blocks)\n\n    # Populate output grid\n    row, col = 0, 0\n    for block in ordered_blocks:\n        for r, c, color in block:\n          if (row < 4):\n            output_grid[row, col] = color\n            col += 1\n            if col >= 4:\n                col = 0\n                row += 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
