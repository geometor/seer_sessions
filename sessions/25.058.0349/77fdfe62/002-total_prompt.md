## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 1 0 0 0 0 1 3
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 8 0 0 1 0
0 1 8 8 0 8 1 0
0 1 0 0 8 0 1 0
0 1 8 0 8 8 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
4 1 0 0 0 0 1 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x76911EBFDB30>

**output:**
```
0 2 0 0
2 2 0 3
0 0 6 0
4 0 6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x76911EBFDBD0>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and the proposed transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The colors (represented by numbers) in the input grid seem to be selectively extracted and repositioned in the output grid. The input grid contains a large, contiguous "frame" of blue (1) pixels.  The output grid appears to sample pixels from only the corners of the object formed by the non-blue pixels within the frame.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a grid of 8x8 pixels.
  - observation: Output is a grid of 4x4 pixels.
  - observation: Input grid has a prominent blue (1) border.
  - observation: The blue border fully encloses other colors.
  - observation: Output grid contains colors from the input grid, excluding blue (1) and white (0).
  - observation: Output grid's colored pixels correspond to the corner pixels of colored regions inside the blue border in the Input grid.
  - observation: Corners are judged by the boundaries made by non-blue and non-white pixels.
  - property: Colors represent pixel values.
  - property: Grid dimensions are different between input and output.
  - action: Extraction of corner pixel colors.
  - action: Repositioning of extracted colors in a smaller grid.
  - relationship: Input grid pixels map to output grid pixels based on position and color, specifically corner locations.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Inner Region:** Locate the rectangular region within the input grid that is enclosed by the blue (1) border.

2.  **Locate corner pixels of non-blue, non-white regions:**  Identify "corner" pixels inside the inner region. A "corner" means a colored pixel, which is *not* white or blue that makes a corner when considering all non-white and non-blue regions, and that are adjacent to either a white or blue.

3. **Sample corner pixels in clockwise order:** The corners define an ordered set of pixels, starting at the top-left, then top-right, bottom-right and finally bottom-left

4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 4x4 output grid.

5.  **Place Extracted Colors:** Populate the output grid in the order with values identified earlier:
    *   Top-left corner color goes to output grid (0,1).
    *   Top-right corner color goes to output grid (1,3).
    *    Bottom-right corner color goes to output grid (2,2).
    *   Bottom-left corner color goes to output grid (3,0).
    *   If multiple, adjacent, corner colors are identified, perform this same action to adjacent cells in the output grid, starting with the positions described.
6. **Fill:** Fill the remaining cells of the output grid with 0 (white).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
