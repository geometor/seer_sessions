"""
1.  **Pattern Extraction:** Extract the 3x3 subgrid from the top-left corner of the input grid. This is the repeating pattern.

2.  **Pattern Replication:** Replicate this 3x3 pattern across the entire output grid, tiling it both horizontally and vertically.  This means the output grid's values at `(i, j)` will initially be set to the input grid's values at `(i % 3, j % 3)`.

3.  **Zero Filling (Corrected):** After the pattern replication, iterate through the output grid. For each cell containing a 0 (white), find the nearest, non-zero pixel, treating the grid as a connected space of individual 3x3 cells (from step 2).
    - Use the value of that non-zero neighbor to fill.

In other words, propagate the color from non-zero "seed" pixels to all connected zero-value neighbors using the repeating 3 x 3 cell as a guide for propagation.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial approach of extracting the 3x3 pattern and tiling it was a good starting point, and it worked perfectly for the first example. However, the subsequent examples reveal a flaw in the zero-filling logic. The original `propagate_color` function attempted to find the nearest non-zero neighbor, but it wasn't correctly constrained by the 3x3 cell boundaries, and the search for non-zero neighbor was flawed. The updated `propagate_color` looks in neighboring pixels within each 3x3 cell.

The core issue is how we define "nearest" and how propagation is limited. It's not a global nearest-neighbor search. Instead, the propagation of color should occur *within* the context of each replicated 3x3 cell. If a cell is white (0), we want to use the color of non-white pixels of the 3x3 input pattern, located using modular arithmetic.

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

To understand the errors better, let's examine each example. I will use numpy to compare the expected outputs, and the actual results, and I will execute the existing transform() function on the inputs.

```python
import numpy as np

def compare_results(expected, actual):
    """Compares two grids and returns the number of mismatched pixels."""
    return np.sum(np.array(expected) != np.array(actual))

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
task_description: |
  The task involves replicating a 3x3 pattern from the input grid to create an output grid of the same dimensions.
  Any 'white' (0) pixels in the replicated pattern are replaced with the nearest non-white color within their corresponding 3x3 cell.

objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - dimensions: height x width (variable, but consistent with output_grid)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - dimensions: height x width (same as input_grid)

  - name: pattern
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - dimensions: 3x3 (fixed)
      - source: top-left corner of input_grid

actions:
  - name: replicate_pattern
    description: Tile the 3x3 pattern across the output grid.
    input: input_grid, pattern
    output: output_grid (partially filled)

  - name: fill_zeros
    description: Replace zero values in the output_grid with the color of the nearest non-zero value within its corresponding 3x3 cell.
    input: output_grid, pattern
    output: output_grid (fully filled)
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Extract Pattern:** Identify the 3x3 subgrid at the top-left corner of the input grid as the repeating pattern.

2.  **Replicate Pattern:** Tile this 3x3 pattern across the output grid. The output grid cell at `(i, j)` gets its initial value from the input grid cell at `(i % 3, j % 3)`.

3.  **Fill White Pixels (Zero Values):** For every white pixel (value 0) in the output grid, replace its value with the nearest non-white pixel within the same 3x3 cell. The "same 3x3 cell" is defined by the replication process. Specifically, if a pixel is at (i, j) in the output grid, we consider the non zero pixels in its neighborhood.

The updated code and results appear to implement the natural language program correctly.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
