facts:
  - observation: "The initial assumption of a fixed 2x2 pattern is incorrect."
  - observation: "Input and output grid shapes are always identical."
  - observation: "The output grid is constructed by repeating a smaller pattern identified from the input."
  - observation: "The colors in the output may be present in the input but it is not an inherent requirement."
  - object_types:
      - name: pattern_unit
        description: "The repeating unit found within the input grid."
