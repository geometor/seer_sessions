facts:
  - observation: "The input grid's top-left 3x3 subgrid is a repeating pattern."
  - pattern_size: "3x3"
  - pattern_replication: "The 3x3 pattern is tiled across the output grid."
  - fill_rule_initial_incorrect: "Zeros in the output grid are initially filled with the value to their immediate left, and up if at edge."
  - fill_rule_example_1: "Works perfectly when filling zeros."
  - fill_rule_example_2: "Works perfectly, even with a 9 at i,j == 2,2."
  - fill_rule_example_3: "Fails to propagate colours across larger regions of 0s, needs to propagate color from a non-zero source."
  - fill_rule_type: "Context-dependent color propagation, filling regions of 0 from a seed non-zero pixel."
