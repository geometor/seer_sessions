## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 2
0 0 0 0 1 2 4
0 0 0 1 2 4 0
0 0 1 2 4 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x76911E9725D0>

**output:**
```
2 4 1 2 4 1 2
4 1 2 4 1 2 4
1 2 4 1 2 4 1
2 4 1 2 4 1 2
4 1 2 4 1 2 4
1 2 4 1 2 4 1
2 4 1 2 4 1 2
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another grid of numerical values. The input grid appears to have a diagonal pattern of increasing values (1, 2, 4) emanating from the lower-left corner, surrounded by zeros (white). The output grid has a checkerboard-like pattern using only the values 1, 2, and 4, arranged in a repeating sequence both horizontally and vertically. The zeros from the input are completely replaced.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid has a diagonal pattern of increasing numbers (1, 2, 4).
  - observation: Input grid contains many 0 values surrounding the diagonal.
  - observation: Output grid has a repeating checkerboard pattern of 1, 2, and 4.
  - observation: Output grid has no 0 values.
  - observation: The dimensions of input and output grids are the same (7x7).
  - relationship: The output pattern seems independent of the input's diagonal, replacing all values.
  - property: Colors involved are blue(1), red(2) and yellow(4).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Ignore** the input grid's values entirely.
2.  **Create** a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  **Fill** the new grid with a repeating checkerboard pattern using the values 1, 2, and 4.
4.  **Start** the top-left cell with the value '2'.
5.  **Alternate** the values horizontally and vertically in the sequence 2, 4, 1, repeating. In other words, if a cell has value 2, its right neighbor and its bottom neighbor must be 4.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
