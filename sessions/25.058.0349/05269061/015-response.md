Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and develop a refined understanding of the transformation.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a very specific observation from the first training example, assuming a fixed 2x2 pattern ([4, 8], [3, 4]) replication. This assumption is clearly incorrect, as the subsequent training examples demonstrate different patterns and logic. The core issue is that the initial code doesn't *derive* the pattern from the input; it *imposes* a predefined pattern. We need to shift our approach to one that identifies and extracts the relevant pattern from each input grid individually. The description correctly identifies extraction of unique non-zero digits, but then jumps to 2x2 arrangement, which is not consistent.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Object Identification:** We need to correctly identify what constitutes an "object" in each input grid. Based on the prior, it's the continguous block of one or more pixels. The initial description jumped to assuming a 2x2 tile was constructed, which is not correct, we should not assume this.
2.  **Pattern Extraction:** Instead of hardcoding a pattern, we must analyze each `input_grid` to determine the repeating unit (if any). This might involve looking for symmetries, repetitions, or other structural regularities.
3. **Output generation:** If a pattern is identified, then the output should be based on the extracted unit.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To get accurate reports, I'll use a hypothetical `code_execution` function to simulate analysis.  In a real environment, this would involve running code and inspecting the results.

```python
def code_execution(input_grid, output_grid, expected_output):
    """
    Simulates code execution and provides metrics.  In a real environment,
    this would involve running code against NumPy arrays.
    """

    correct_pixels = np.sum(output_grid == expected_output)
    total_pixels = output_grid.size
    accuracy = correct_pixels / total_pixels if total_pixels > 0 else 0.0

    report = {
        "input_shape": input_grid.shape,
        "output_shape": output_grid.shape,
        "expected_output_shape": expected_output.shape,
        "accuracy": accuracy,
        "notes": ""
    }
    if input_grid.shape != expected_output.shape:
        report["notes"] = "Input and expected output shapes differ."

    return report

# example data (replace with actual data)
example_reports = []
for i in range(len(task_json['train'])):
  input_grid = np.array(task_json['train'][i]['input'])
  output_grid = transform(input_grid)
  expected_output = np.array(task_json['train'][i]['output'])
  example_reports.append(code_execution(input_grid, output_grid, expected_output))

for i, report in enumerate(example_reports):
    print(f"--- Example {i+1} ---")
    for key, value in report.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

```

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task_id: 7b60105d
facts:
  - observation: "The initial assumption of a fixed 2x2 pattern is incorrect."
  - observation: "Input and output grid shapes are always identical."
  - observation: "The output grid is constructed by repeating a smaller pattern identified from the input."
  - observation: "The colors in the output may be present in the input but it is not an inherent requirement."
  - object_types:
      - name: pattern_unit
        description: "The repeating unit found within the input grid."
        properties:
           - colors: "The colors in the repeating unit"
  - actions:
    - name: identify_pattern
      description: "Find the repeating unit within the input grid."
    - name: replicate_pattern
      description: "Replicate extracted unit to fill the output grid."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the repeating pattern unit:** Examine the input grid to locate the smallest repeating rectangular block of pixels. The block does not require containing colors from the input.
2.  **Replicate the pattern:** Create the output grid by repeating the identified pattern unit. Ensure the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. The replication should tile the pattern, extending it both horizontally and vertically.
