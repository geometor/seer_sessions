Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another grid of numerical values. The input grid appears to have a diagonal pattern of increasing values (1, 2, 4) emanating from the lower-left corner, surrounded by zeros (white). The output grid has a checkerboard-like pattern using only the values 1, 2, and 4, arranged in a repeating sequence both horizontally and vertically. The zeros from the input are completely replaced.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid has a diagonal pattern of increasing numbers (1, 2, 4).
  - observation: Input grid contains many 0 values surrounding the diagonal.
  - observation: Output grid has a repeating checkerboard pattern of 1, 2, and 4.
  - observation: Output grid has no 0 values.
  - observation: The dimensions of input and output grids are the same (7x7).
  - relationship: The output pattern seems independent of the input's diagonal, replacing all values.
  - property: Colors involved are blue(1), red(2) and yellow(4).
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Ignore** the input grid's values entirely.
2.  **Create** a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  **Fill** the new grid with a repeating checkerboard pattern using the values 1, 2, and 4.
4.  **Start** the top-left cell with the value '2'.
5.  **Alternate** the values horizontally and vertically in the sequence 2, 4, 1, repeating. In other words, if a cell has value 2, its right neighbor and its bottom neighbor must be 4.
