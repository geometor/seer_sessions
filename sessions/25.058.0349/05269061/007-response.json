The input grid appears to have a diagonal pattern of increasing values (1, 2, 4) emanating from the lower-left corner, surrounded by zeros (white). The output grid has a checkerboard-like pattern using only the values 1, 2, and 4, arranged in a repeating sequence both horizontally and vertically. The zeros from the input are completely replaced.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
