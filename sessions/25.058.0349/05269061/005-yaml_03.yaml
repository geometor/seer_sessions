task_description: |
  The task involves replicating a 3x3 pattern from the input grid to create an output grid of the same dimensions.
  Any 'white' (0) pixels in the replicated pattern are replaced with the nearest non-white color within their corresponding 3x3 cell.

objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - dimensions: height x width (variable, but consistent with output_grid)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - dimensions: height x width (same as input_grid)

  - name: pattern
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - dimensions: 3x3 (fixed)
      - source: top-left corner of input_grid

actions:
  - name: replicate_pattern
    description: Tile the 3x3 pattern across the output grid.
    input: input_grid, pattern
    output: output_grid (partially filled)

  - name: fill_zeros
    description: Replace zero values in the output_grid with the color of the nearest non-zero value within its corresponding 3x3 cell.
    input: output_grid, pattern
    output: output_grid (fully filled)
