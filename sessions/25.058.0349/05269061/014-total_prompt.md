## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 3 0
0 0 0 8 3 0 0
0 0 8 3 0 0 0
0 8 3 0 0 0 4
8 3 0 0 0 4 0
3 0 0 0 4 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x76911E972530>

**output:**
```
4 8 3 4 8 3 4
8 3 4 8 3 4 8
3 4 8 3 4 8 3

```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 7x7 grid, and the output is also a 7x7 grid. The input grid contains a diagonal line of numbers (8, 3) extending from the top-right to the bottom-left. Another diagonal of numbers (4) extends from near the middle-right towards the bottom-center.  The output grid seems to be a tessellation or tiling, using the numbers, and possibly colors from input, in repeating 2x2 pattern. The colors in the input grid are not uniformly distributed and appear related to specific number.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_description: |
  The task involves transforming a grid of colored numbers into a new grid with a repeating pattern.
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 7x7
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      notable_elements:
          - value: 8
            color: azure
          - value: 3
            color: green
          - value: 4
            color: yellow
        
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 7x7
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      pattern: repeating 2x2 structure

actions:
  - name: identify_pattern
    description: Find the core repeating unit in output.
  - name: map_colors
    description: Determine the relationship between numbers in input and elements of output.
  - name: replicate
    description: construct output using rule

relationships:
  - type: input_to_output
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid by extracting a set of colored values, generating a 2x2 pattern based on it, and replicating the 2 x 2 pattern to create the entire output grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Values:** Observe the input grid and note the non-zero values (8, 3, and 4). and that they are unique.

2.  **Establish Color-Value Mapping:** The input grid provides us with a mapping of values to colors: 8 (azure), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).

3.  **Construct the 2x2 Pattern:**
    *   Create a 2x2 foundational tile. The specific arrangement on this tile appears based on a simplified/abstracted diagonal rule of sorts.
    *   Note that the original input diagonal runs top-right (8,3) to bottom left
    *   An inverse arrangement of 4 at the beginning on the first row.

4. **Create the Output.**

    - arrange the 2x2 pattern like so:


```
4 8
3 4
```


5.  **Replicate the Pattern:** Tile the 2x2 pattern across the entire output grid, maintaining the relative positions of the colors/numbers. Since the output is 7x7, the final row and column will "cut off" the 2x2 tile.

In essence, the transformation extracts the unique non-zero digits and their associated colors, builds a specific base 2x2 arrangement, and then replicates that tile across the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
