The input grid appears to have a smaller section of non-zero (non-white) pixels, while the output grid has a larger, repeating pattern. The colors in the input (red, azure, green, and white) are all present in the output. The input grid is 7x7, and the output grid is 7x7. The upper left 3x3 subgrid seems to determine the pattern.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This subgrid will serve as the repeating pattern unit. In this example it is `[[2, 8, 3], [8, 3, 0], [3, 0, 0]]`\n\n2.  **Replicate and Fill:** Replicate this 3x3 pattern across the entire output grid, tiling it horizontally and vertically. Replace all 0s with the value of the pixel to its immediate left.\n\n3. Specifically, iterate through the output grid. For each cell:\n    - if the corresponding input x,y coordinates mod 3 match the output x,y coordinate, set the output value to be equal to the input value at the mod 3 coordinate.\n    - otherwise, if the cell value is 0 (white), set its value to the color of the cell immediately to its left.\n    - If no value to left, look up.\n"
