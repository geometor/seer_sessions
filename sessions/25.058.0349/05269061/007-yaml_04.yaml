facts:
  - observation: Input grid has a diagonal pattern of increasing numbers (1, 2, 4).
  - observation: Input grid contains many 0 values surrounding the diagonal.
  - observation: Output grid has a repeating checkerboard pattern of 1, 2, and 4.
  - observation: Output grid has no 0 values.
  - observation: The dimensions of input and output grids are the same (7x7).
  - relationship: The output pattern seems independent of the input's diagonal, replacing all values.
  - property: Colors involved are blue(1), red(2) and yellow(4).
