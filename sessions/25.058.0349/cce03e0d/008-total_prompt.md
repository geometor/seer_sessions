## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 1 2
1 1 0
2 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x76911EBFDBD0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x76911EBD2CB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (9x9). The input grid contains single-digit integers representing colors. The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input, with the original input grid replicated in specific locations within the larger grid. Specifically two copies, one at the top right and one at the bottom left. The rest of the output grid is filled with zeros (white).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-2) representing colors
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements: integers (0-2) representing colors, predominantly 0
  - relation: expansion
    from: input grid
    to: output grid
    rule: "The input grid seems to be replicated at the top right and bottom left of a larger empty grid"
  - object: input_grid_copy_1
    location: top right corner
    of: output_grid
  - object: input_grid_copy_2
    location: bottom left corner
    of: output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Create an empty 9x9 grid:** Initialize a 9x9 grid filled with zeros (representing the color white).
2.  **Copy the input grid:** Create a copy of original 3x3 input grid.
3.  **Place Copy 1:** Place a the copy of the input grid into the top-right corner of the 9x9 grid. The top-left corner of the copied input aligns at coordinates (0,6) relative to output grid's origin.
4.  **Place Copy 2:** Place a the copy of the input grid into the bottom-left corner of the 9x9 grid. The top-left corner of the copied input aligns at coordinates (6,0) relative to output grid's origin.
5. Output final 9x9.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
