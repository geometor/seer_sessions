The input grid contains single-digit integers representing colors (0-9, though this example only shows 0, 1, and 2). The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid.  The core pattern seems to be a replication of the input, interspersed with regions of 0 (white).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
