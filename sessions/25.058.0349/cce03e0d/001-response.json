The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid. The most obvious change is an expansion of the grid's dimensions. The colors in the input grid (represented by digits 0, 1, and 2) seem to be preserved in the expanded output grid, but their positions are relative to the original dimensions of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Colors 0, 1, and 2 from the input appear in the output.\n  - observation: Position mapping. The input grid's top-left cell (0,0) corresponds to the output grid's cell (3,0).  The x dimension is multiplied by 3.\n  - observation: Blank padding: The expanded output grid has all cells except the original pixels initialized with zeros.\n  - object: input_grid\n    properties:\n      dimensions: 3x3\n      colors: [0, 1, 2]\n  - object: output_grid\n    properties:\n      dimensions: 9x9\n      colors: [0, 1, 2]\n  - relationship: output_grid is an expanded version of input_grid\n  - action: expansion\n    details: multiplying both dimensions by 3.\n  - action: color_mapping\n    details: transferring the color from input_grid to the expanded cells of the output_grid\n  - action: padding\n    details: default color is set to 0 in empty cells\n```"

For each cell:\n   - Multiply the row index by 3.\n   - Multiply the column index by 3.\n   - Copy the color value from the input grid cell to the corresponding cell in the output grid at calculated row, col.\n\nIn essence, the program takes each pixel in the input and places it in the top-left corner of a 3x3 sub-grid within the larger output grid.\n"
