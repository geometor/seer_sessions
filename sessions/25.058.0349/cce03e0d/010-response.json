            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a very limited observation (only the first training example). It correctly identified the input grid and attempted to replicate it with padding. However, it failed to generalize the transformation rule, specifically the pattern of padding and the overall structure of the output. The core issue is that the transformation isn't simply padding; it involves creating a larger grid with a specific arrangement of the original input within a larger frame of zeros, and the placement of a mirrored input shape.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine all input/output pairs to understand the consistent elements of the transformation. Focus on the relative positioning, size changes, and the presence of any repeating patterns beyond simple replication.\n2.  **Identify Key Transformation Features:** Determine how the dimensions of the input grid relate to the output grid, how the original input is positioned within the output, and the nature of other added components (padding with zeros, mirrored shapes).\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed analysis, develop a clear, concise program that captures the precise steps of the transformation.\n4. Build a structured represention in YAML, this representation should be able to fully specify all the examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (from provided code execution and visual inspection):**\n\n```\n{\n'train_1_in': (3, 3),\n'train_1_out': (9, 9),\n'train_2_in': (5, 5),\n'train_2_out': (15, 15),\n'train_3_in': (2, 2),\n'train_3_out': (6, 6)\n}\n```\n\n*   **Input:** All inputs are square grids consisting of only the color blue (`1`).\n*   **Output:** All outputs are square grids. The output dimensions are three times the input dimensions. The original input appears in the top-right corner. A mirrored version of the original input appears in the bottom-left corner. The rest of the output grid is filled with white (`0`).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: replication_and_mirroring\ninput_objects:\n  - id: original_shape\n    color: blue\n    shape: square\n    dimensions: input_grid_dimensions\noutput_objects:\n  - id: top_right_shape\n    copy_of: original_shape\n    position: top_right\n  - id: bottom_left_shape\n    mirror_of: original_shape\n    position: bottom_left\n  - id: background\n    color: white\n    shape: square\n    dimensions: output_grid_dimensions\nrelationships:\n  - output_grid_dimensions: 3 * input_grid_dimensions\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Measure Input:** Determine the height and width of the input grid. Let this value be *N*.\n2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new square grid with dimensions 3*N x 3*N. Initialize all cells to white (0).\n3.  **Place Original:** Copy the original input grid and place it in the top-right corner of the output grid. The top-left corner of input will correspond to cell(*2N*, *2N*) in the new grid.\n4.  **Place Mirrored:** Copy the original input grid and place a mirrored copy in the bottom left corner. The position of the mirrored copy will be from (0,0) to (*N*,*N*).\n5.  **Return the output grid.**\n"
