However, the subsequent examples reveal variations and complexities not addressed by the initial approach. The core issue is that the initial program is too specific (find the yellow 'C') and must be generalized. We see that the examples include other colors of 'C' shapes as well as non-C shapes. So our focus needs to be on finding *any* object and extracting a subgrid.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors involves these key steps:\n\n1.  **Generalize Object Identification:** Instead of looking for only yellow \"C\" shapes, the code should identify any contiguous object of a single color.\n2.  **Handle Different Subgrid Sizes:**\u00a0The 2x2 extraction size is not fixed. We need to determine how to handle the different sizes, or figure out the rule for this.\n3. **Handle variations in shape and color**: We have seen a red 'C' in example two and a solid gray rectangle in example three.\n\n**Metrics and Observations from Code Execution**\n\nTo gather precise metrics, I'll use `code_execution` on the examples, and use this to help determine the facts. I'll analyze:\n\n*   Presence and location of the target object (the \"C\" or other shapes).\n*   Size and location of extracted subgrids in both the expected outputs and the actual outputs of the current code.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_object_bounding_box(grid, color):\n    rows, cols = np.where(grid == color)\n    if len(rows) == 0:\n        return None\n    top_left = (min(rows), min(cols))\n    bottom_right = (max(rows), max(cols))\n    return top_left, bottom_right\n\ndef get_object_details(grid):\n  objects = {}\n  grid_array = np.array(grid)\n  for color in np.unique(grid_array):\n    bounding_box = find_object_bounding_box(grid_array, color)\n    if bounding_box:\n      top_left, bottom_right = bounding_box\n      objects[color] = {\n          'top_left': top_left,\n          'bottom_right': bottom_right,\n          'width': bottom_right[1] - top_left[1] + 1,\n          'height': bottom_right[0] - top_left[0] + 1\n      }\n  return objects\n\ndef analyze_example(example):\n    input_grid = example['input']\n    expected_output_grid = example['output']\n    predicted_output_grid = transform(input_grid)  # Uses the existing transform function.\n\n    input_objects = get_object_details(input_grid)\n    expected_output_objects = get_object_details(expected_output_grid)\n    predicted_output_objects = get_object_details(predicted_output_grid)\n\n    print(f\"Input Objects: {input_objects}\")\n    print(f\"Expected Output Objects: {expected_output_objects}\")\n    print(f\"Predicted Output Objects: {predicted_output_objects}\")\n    print(f\"Predicted vs Expected Output: {predicted_output_grid == expected_output_grid}\")\n    print(\"---\")\n\ntrain_examples = task[\"train\"]\nfor i, example in enumerate(train_examples):\n  print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n  analyze_example(example)\n```"
