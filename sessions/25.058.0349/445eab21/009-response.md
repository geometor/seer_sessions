Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine our approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a very specific observation from the first training example (a 2x2 orange square). It correctly produced the output for the first example but failed on subsequent examples. This indicates an over-simplification in the initial natural language program. The core issue is that the program doesn't generalize; it only works for the specific case of the first input.

Our strategy should shift to identifying the *general* rule that applies to *all* examples, not just the first. We need to move beyond simply creating a 2x2 orange square and, instead, focus on identifying what characteristics of the *input* consistently determine properties of the output. We will examine the input and output grids for consistent patterns. The size and other pixel values are not consistent, but the presence of orange is consistent.

**Metrics and Observations**

To gather more specific data, I will use the `code_execution` tool to inspect the input and output grids of each training example. This will help us pinpoint the common transformation rule. I'll focus on:

1.  Presence/absence of specific colors in input and output.
2.  Sizes of the input and output grids.
3.  Presence of any geometric transformations or object manipulations.

I am specifically testing for "orange"

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def has_color(grid, color):
    return np.any(grid == color)

def grid_size(grid):
    return grid.shape

def analyze_example(example):
    input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
    output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
    analysis = {
        'input_has_orange': has_color(input_grid, 7),
        'output_has_orange': has_color(output_grid, 7),
        'input_size': grid_size(input_grid),
        'output_size': grid_size(output_grid),
    }
    return analysis

examples = task_data['train']
results = [analyze_example(example) for example in examples]
print(results)

```
