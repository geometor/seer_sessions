## Example 2

**input:**
```
6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0
6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0
0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0
0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0
0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x76911EBFDE50>

**output:**
```
7 7
7 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x76911EBFE030>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains two distinct colored regions (magenta and orange, represented by 6 and 7 respectively) against a background (white, represented by 0). The output grid seems to be a significantly smaller, solid rectangle comprised of only one of the colors from the input, the orange (7). The shape and background from the input are not present in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [10, 10] # Input grid dimensions
      colors: [0, 6, 7] # white, magenta, orange
    contains:
      - shape_1:
          color: 6 #magenta
          type: irregular, possibly a closed shape at top
      - shape_2:
          color: 7   #orange
          type: irregular, possibly a closed shape in bottom
      - background:
          color: 0

  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [2, 2] # Output grid dimensions
      colors: [7]    # orange
    contains:
      - shape:
        color: 7     # orange
        type: rectangle

actions:
  - type: selection
    description: Selects the color orange (7).
  - type: reduction
    description: Reduces the selected shape or color to a 2x2 rectangle.

relationships:
  - input_contains_output_color: True # The output color exists within input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all distinct colored regions within the input grid.
2.  **Select** the orange colored region (value 7).
3.  **Discard** all other colors and regions.
4.  **Create** a new 2x2 grid.
5.  **Fill** all cells of the new grid with the selected color (orange, 7).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
