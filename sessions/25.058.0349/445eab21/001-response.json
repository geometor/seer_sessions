The input grid appears to contain two distinct rectangular shapes, one orange (7) and one azure (8). The output grid seems to be a highly simplified representation, focusing solely on the azure (8) colored shape and reducing it to a 2x2 block. The orange shape and the white background are completely ignored.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

A distinct shape is defined as a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.\n2.  **Filter by Color:** Ignore any shapes that are not colored azure (8).\n3.  **Reduce Azure Shape:** If an azure shape is found, create a 2x2 square filled with the azure color (8). The location of this square does not need to maintain or be relative to the location of the original shape.\n4. **Ignore the Rest:** The positions of the ignored shapes are irrelevant, along with that, the size and specific dimensions of the input azure shape doesn't determine the output azure shape's size.\n5. **Output:** create and return the 2x2 azure shape, other shapes and background should be ignored.\n\nEssentially, the transformation rule is to detect the presence of an azure (8) colored rectangle and, if found, output a 2x2 azure square, disregard everything else.\n"
