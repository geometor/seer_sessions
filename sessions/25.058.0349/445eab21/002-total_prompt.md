## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x76911EBFE030>

**output:**
```
8 8
8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x76911EE1F750>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9) into a smaller grid. The input grid appears to contain two distinct rectangular shapes, one orange (7) and one azure (8). The output grid seems to be a highly simplified representation, focusing solely on the azure (8) colored shape and reducing it to a 2x2 block. The orange shape and the white background are completely ignored.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: shape_1
    color: orange (7)
    type: rectangle
    position: top-left
    action: ignored
  - object: shape_2
    color: azure (8)
    type: rectangle
    position: middle
    action: reduced
  - background:
    color: white (0)
    action: ignored
  - output_shape:
    color: azure (8)
    type: rectangle
    dimensions: 2x2
    relation_to_input: derived from shape_2
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct rectangular shapes within the input grid. A distinct shape is defined as a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
2.  **Filter by Color:** Ignore any shapes that are not colored azure (8).
3.  **Reduce Azure Shape:** If an azure shape is found, create a 2x2 square filled with the azure color (8). The location of this square does not need to maintain or be relative to the location of the original shape.
4. **Ignore the Rest:** The positions of the ignored shapes are irrelevant, along with that, the size and specific dimensions of the input azure shape doesn't determine the output azure shape's size.
5. **Output:** create and return the 2x2 azure shape, other shapes and background should be ignored.

Essentially, the transformation rule is to detect the presence of an azure (8) colored rectangle and, if found, output a 2x2 azure square, disregard everything else.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
