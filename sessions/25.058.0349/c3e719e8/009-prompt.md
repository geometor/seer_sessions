Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is replicated four times to create a mirrored pattern. The output grid's dimensions are determined by the input grid's dimensions. Specifically, the output width is twice the input width plus one, and the output height is twice the input height plus one. A single row and column of zeros are inserted between the replicated input grids to separate them.

    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape

    # Calculate output grid dimensions
    output_height = 2 * input_height + 1
    output_width = 2 * input_width + 1

    # Initialize output_grid as calculated dimensions filled with 0s
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
