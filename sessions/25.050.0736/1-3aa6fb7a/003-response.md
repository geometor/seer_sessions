Okay, let's analyze the second example provided.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)]
  dimensions: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
       shape: single cell
       positions: [(1,4)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions:  [(2,3)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)]
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        positions: [(5,3)]
  dimensions: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we identify three distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Object Persistence:** All azure L-shaped objects are still present in the output grid, and maintain their original shape and position.

3. **Detect change:** We can see a change of color from color 0 to color 1 on the right of the top-left element of each azure object.

**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language)**

The transformation preserves the azure L-shaped objects. The transformation paints blue the cell immediately to the right of the top-left corner element of each azure L-shape.

The provided Python code and natural language description correctly capture the essence of this transformation. The `find_objects` function identifies azure objects, `get_top_left` extracts each top-left element, and the `transform` function applies the color change to the specified adjacent cell.
