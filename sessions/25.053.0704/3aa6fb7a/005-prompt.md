1. Identify Azure Objects: Find all contiguous groups of azure (8) colored pixels.  Each group is considered a separate object.

2.  Find Top-Left and Top-Right Pixels:  For *each* identified azure object:
    *   Find the top-left most pixel. If the object is more than one pixel, transform the pixel to blue.
    *   Find the top-right most pixel. If the object is more than one pixel, transform the pixel to blue.

3.  Output: The output grid is a copy of the input grid, but with the top-left and top-right pixels of all azure objects are changed to blue (1).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
