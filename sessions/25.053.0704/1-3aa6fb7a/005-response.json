            "text": "Okay, I've analyzed the provided examples and the previous code, and I see where the error lies. My previous natural language program and the subsequent code were almost correct, but they had a slight misunderstanding of \"top-left\" and \"top-right\". It's not just sorting and picking; it needs to account for ties.\n\nHere's the refined natural language program:\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Find all contiguous groups of azure (8) colored pixels. Each group is considered a separate object.\n\n2.  **Find Top-Left Pixels:** For each identified azure object:\n    *   Find all pixels that are at the highest row (minimum row value).\n    *   Among these, select the pixel(s) furthest to the left (minimum column value).\n    *   Change the color of pixel to blue.\n\n3.  **Find Top-Right Pixels:** For each identified azure object:\n    * Find all pixels that are at the highest row (minimum row value).\n    * Among these, select the pixel(s) furthest to the right (maximum column value).\n    * Change the color of pixel to blue.\n\n4.  **Output:** The output grid is a copy of the input grid, but with the top-left and top-right pixels (as defined above) of all azure objects are changed to blue (1).\n\nThe key difference from the previous natural language program is the correct handling of ties for top most, then take the left-most or right-most of just those at the top.\n"
