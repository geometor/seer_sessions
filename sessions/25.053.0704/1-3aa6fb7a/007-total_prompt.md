Okay, I will analyze the provided input and output grids to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:


```yaml
facts:
  - grid_size: 7x7
  - input_objects:
    - Two separate azure objects.
    - Object 1: A 2x1 vertical rectangle at (1,1) and (2,1).
    - Object 2: A 2x1 horizontal rectangle at (3,4) and (4,5).
  - output_objects:
    - Two azure objects of same dimension and location,
    - The color of 2 pixels are changed from azure to blue
  - color_changes:
    - (2,1) azure -> blue
    - (4,4) azure -> blue
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure colored objects within the input grid.
2.  **Describe object as a set of pixels and their locations**
3.  **Change the color of specific pixel to blue**
    Locate one pixel of that object that is at highest row, take the pixel at the top right.
4.  Copy the input to the output.
5. Change the color of the identified pixels to blue.

In summary: The transformation identifies two azure objects in the grid and in each object, replaces the most top right pixel to blue. The modified objects are then placed in the output grid, maintaining their original positions and other pixel colors.

```python

def find_objects(grid, color):
    objects = []
    visited = set()

    def dfs(r, c, current_object):
        if (r, c) in visited or not (0 <= r < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= c < grid.shape[1]) or grid[r, c] != color:
            return
        visited.add((r, c))
        current_object.append((r, c))
        dfs(r + 1, c, current_object)
        dfs(r - 1, c, current_object)
        dfs(r, c + 1, current_object)
        dfs(r, c - 1, current_object)

    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):
        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):
            if grid[r, c] == color and (r, c) not in visited:

    # Sort by row (ascending) then by column (descending)
    sorted_pixels = sorted(object_pixels, key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    return sorted_pixels[0]


def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Find azure objects
    azure_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 8)

    # Change the color of the top-right pixel of each azure object to blue
    for obj in azure_objects:
      top_right_pixel = find_top_right_pixel(obj)
      output_grid[top_right_pixel]=1

    return output_grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- You may use code execution to examine the details of the task
- Document facts in a YAML block 
- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.  - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.

remember - your response here will be included in the history of the next
prompt as we move through the process. Be sure to include excellent information
for you future self to solve the task.
