Copy the input to the output.\n5. Change the color of the identified pixels to blue.\n\nIn summary: The transformation identifies two azure objects in the grid and in each object, replaces the most top right pixel to blue. The modified objects are then placed in the output grid, maintaining their original positions and other pixel colors.\n"
