Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid is significantly larger and more complex than the output grid. The output grid appears to be a highly simplified and cropped version of a specific region within the input grid. The colors present are red (2), azure (8), green (3), and blue (1). The dominant color in the input is red. The output focuses on an azure shape on a red background.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: 19x17 (height x width)
      - colors: [red, azure, green, blue]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: 5x3 (height x width)
      - colors: [red, azure]
  - type: shape
    properties:
      - name: azure_shape
      - color: azure
      - location: input_grid, centered horizontally, spanning vertically in multiple disconnected segments
actions:
  - type: crop
    description: Select a sub-region of the input grid.
  - type: simplify
    description: Retain only the azure shape and its immediate red background.
relationships:
  - output_grid is a cropped and simplified version of input_grid.
  - azure_shape is the primary focus of the transformation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Region of Interest:** Locate the contiguous or nearly contiguous azure (8) pixels within the input grid that form a recognizable shape.
2.  **Define Boundaries:** Find the bounding box that tightly encloses this azure shape. Extend the boundaries of this bounding box to minimally include the border created by the red pixels that surround or intersect the azure shape.
3.  **Crop:** Extract the sub-grid defined by the bounding box in the previous step.
4. **Output Result:** Produce this cropped section as the output.

In essence, the transformation isolates and extracts a specific azure-colored feature and its immediate red background from the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
