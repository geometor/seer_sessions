The input grid is significantly larger and more complex than the output grid. The output grid appears to be a highly simplified and cropped version of a specific region within the input grid. The colors present are red (2), azure (8), green (3), and blue (1). The dominant color in the input is red. The output focuses on an azure shape on a red background.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Extend the boundaries of this bounding box to minimally include the border created by the red pixels that surround or intersect the azure shape.\n3.  **Crop:** Extract the sub-grid defined by the bounding box in the previous step.\n4. **Output Result:** Produce this cropped section as the output.\n\nIn essence, the transformation isolates and extracts a specific azure-colored feature and its immediate red background from the input grid.\n"
