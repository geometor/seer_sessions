facts:
  - observation: |
      The output consistently consists of a vertical stack of green and blue pixels.
  - object_identification: |
      The green object is always a single pixel. The blue pixels are always directly below the green pixel.
  - input_variation: |
      The position of the green and blue pixels changes within the input grid, but the relationship between the green pixel and the blue shapes remains consistent.
  - spatial_relationship: |
      The output is constructed by taking the column containing the green pixel, and extracting a vertical line segment that starts at the green pixel and includes all vertically contiguous blue pixels directly below it.
  - color_filtering:
      Only green (3) and blue (1) colors appear in the output. Other colors are ignored.
  - background:
      The background in the output is white (0)
