Previous Code:
```python
"""
Extracts a 3x3 block centered on a specific target pixel (azure, blue, or magenta).
"""

import numpy as np

def find_target_pixel(grid):
    # Find azure (8), blue (1) or magenta(6) pixels
    target_colors = [8, 1, 6]
    for color in target_colors:
        target_pixels = np.argwhere(grid == color)
        if len(target_pixels) > 0:

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and develop a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code focuses on extracting a 3x3 block around a target pixel (azure, blue, or magenta). This approach works for some cases but fails when the target pixel is near the edge of the input grid, or the expected block has a size different than 3x3, or when there are no target pixels. The strategy for improvement involves:

1.  **Verification of Assumptions**: Double-check if the 3x3 block assumption and target pixel colors are universally valid across all examples.
2.  **Adaptive Block Extraction**: Modify the code to handle edge cases, where the target pixel is near the border, by adjusting the block size.
3.  **Conditional Logic:** Check if the target block size is dynamic.
4.  **No Target Handling:** Return an empty grid if no target pixels are present, ensure this aligns with task expectations by further review.

**Metrics and Observations**

To gather precise metrics, I'll describe what needs to be checked for each example.

*   **Input Grid Dimensions:** Record the height and width of each input grid.
*   **Target Pixel Presence:** Note the presence and location (row, column) of azure, blue, or magenta pixels.
*   **Output Grid Dimensions:** Record the height and width of the expected output grid.
*   **Output Grid Content:** If a 3x3 block is the expected output, examine the content of that block in the input grid.
* **Code Execution Results**: Note dimension errors or incorrect returns.

**Example Analysis Table (Conceptual - Requires Code Execution to Populate)**

| Example | Input Dim | Target Pixel (Row, Col) | Output Dim | Output Content Match | Notes                                         |
| :------ | :-------- | :----------------------- | :--------- | :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| 1       |  x,y       | (r, c) / None           | x',y'       | Yes / No             | Initial observation.                          |
| 2       |   x,y      | (r, c) / None           |  x',y'      | Yes / No             | Check if consistent with example 1.           |
| 3       |   x,y      | (r, c) / None           |  x',y'      | Yes / No             | Check for variations, edge cases, or size changes |

**YAML Facts (Preliminary)**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - description: Input grid
          properties:
            dimensions: [height, width] # To be filled with actual values
            target_pixels: [azure, blue, magenta] # Colors to search for
            target_pixel_location: [row, col] # Location of the first found target pixel, or None
      output_objects:
        - description: Output grid (extracted block)
          properties:
            dimensions: [height, width] # To be filled
            content_match: boolean # To be filled (True if content matches, False otherwise)

  - example_2:
      #similar as above
  - example_3:
     #similar as above
```

**Natural Language Program (Revised)**

1.  **Examine Input:** Take the input grid, which is a 2D array of color values.
2.  **Locate Target:** Search the input grid for a pixel of azure, blue, or magenta color. If multiple such pixels exist, select the first one encountered.
3.  **Handle No Target:** If no azure, blue, or magenta pixel is found, return an empty grid.
4.  **Extract Block:**. If found, attempt to extract a 3x3 block of pixels centered on the target pixel, with adjustments made for target pixels near edges:
  *   Calculate the ideal starting row and column for a 3x3 block, such that target is at the center.
    *    Adjust the starting row/col if near the top/left edges, to the maximum available extent.
    *    Adjust the ending row/col if near the bottom/right edges, to the maximum available extent.
    *    Ensure final block will not exceed the edges of the grid.
5.  **Return Block:** The extracted block is the output grid.

This revised program addresses edge cases and clarifies the steps for block extraction. The YAML block will be populated with concrete data after running code to collect metrics. The code execution will help determine if these refinements correctly model *all* training examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
