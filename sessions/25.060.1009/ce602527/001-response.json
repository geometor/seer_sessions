The input grids appear to contain multiple, potentially overlapping, objects of different colors. The output grids seem to be a simplified representation, possibly focusing on a specific object or a combination of objects and their relative positions. The size of the output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid and varies between examples. It seems the transformation is extracting and condensing specific colored regions.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
