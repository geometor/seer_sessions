The output is a much smaller grid, seemingly summarizing a specific part of the input. The dominant colors in the input appear to be blue (1), with smaller regions of azure (8), red (2), and green (3). The output grid consists only of blue (1) and green (3). It's important to note where the green object is in the input, as the output appears to focus on this element.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Remove all other colors.\n5. **Output the Result:** The resulting filtered region, now the same size as the green object's bounding box, is the output grid.\n\nIn summary, the transformation isolates the green object, takes the surrounding blue and green elements, and filters out other colors.\n"
