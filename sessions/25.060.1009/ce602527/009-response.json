Within this azure background, there are three distinct colored shapes:\n\n1.  A green (3) \"plus\" shape.\n2.  A yellow (4) \"plus\" shape.\n3.  A magenta (6) shape resembling a larger, incomplete square or a thick \"L\".\n\nThe output is a much smaller grid containing only azure (8) and yellow (4) pixels. The arrangement suggests a simplified representation of the yellow \"plus\" shape from the input. The output grid appears to capture the overall extent and relative position the central yellow shape within the input grid\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
