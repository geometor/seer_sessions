task: grid_transformation
input:
  type: 2D_grid
  elements: pixels
  values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  properties:
    - color
    - position (row, column)
output:
  type: 2D_grid
  elements: pixels
  values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  properties:
    - color
    - position (row, column)
observations:
  - input_grids_contain_multiple_colored_regions: "Different colors are present, forming distinct shapes or regions."
  - output_grids_are_smaller: "The output grid dimensions are smaller than the input grid dimensions."
  - output_grids_retain_some_input_colors: "Colors from the input grid appear in the output grid."
  - output_grid_size_varies: "The size of the output grid is not consistent across all examples."
  - potential_object_extraction: "The output might be a simplified representation of a specific object or combination of objects in the input."
  - object_shapes: "Various shapes exist including the number 5 and a cross (+)."
  - object_relationships: "The shapes overlap."
