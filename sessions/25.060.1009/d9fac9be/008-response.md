"""
1. Identify Discontiguous Red Objects: Examine the input grid and identify all discontiguous regions of red pixels (value 2). A "discontiguous region" (or object) is a group of connected red pixels, where connectivity is defined as adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
2. Count Red Objects: Count the number of distinct red objects found in step 1.
3. Determine Output Grid Size: The output grid will be a square grid of size N x N, where N is the number of red objects counted in step 2.
4. Create and Fill Output Grid: Create an N x N grid filled entirely with white pixels (value 0).
