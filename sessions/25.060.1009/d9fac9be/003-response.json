The output appears to be a single color (represented by a number). The input grid seems to contain multiple distinct colored regions. The significant colors seem to be red (2) and yellow (4), with white (0) as a background or separator. The output is a single red (2) pixel. My initial hypothesis is that the output is related to a count, or a selection, of one of the colors present in the input grid, with the criteria for that count/selection yet to be determined.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
