**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of varying sizes as input. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The output appears to be a single digit integer, also one of the colors present in the input grid. The core task is to identify which color from the input grid becomes the output. There isn't any obvious geometric transformation, rotation, or mirroring. The defining feature seems to be related to a comparison or selection of input grid colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_type: color_selection
input:
  type: 2D grid
  elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  properties:
    - height: variable
    - width: variable
output:
  type: single integer (color)
  properties:
     - value: present in input grid
observations:
  - output_is_single_color: true
  - output_color_from_input: true
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input grid and identify all the unique colors present.
2.  Select one color from the unique colors and output it. The choice of which color to use seems to require some reasoning, the color used in the first example is '2' or red, the 2nd example uses '8' or light blue, and the third example uses '1' or dark blue. The choice appears to be the most frequent non-zero color, or if equal a higher value, there is insufficient information to establish a hard rule, but likely a most frequent color.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
