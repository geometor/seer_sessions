<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=768x704 at 0x7FC252BE6AD0>

**output:**
```

```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7FC252BE76D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a grid of colored pixels, with prominent colors being white (0), azure (8), and green (3). The output is a single azure (8) pixel. The input grid appears to have some scattered arrangements of green and azure pixels, while the output isolates a single azure pixel. This suggests a selection or filtering process based on color. It could be that the program counts the different colors and chooses a color that fulfills specific condition.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 11
      columns: 12
      colors: [0, 3, 8] # white, green, azure
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          color: 0 # white
          count: many
      - type: pixel
        properties:
         color: 3 # green
         count: several
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          color: 8 # azure
          count: several

  - type: single_pixel
    properties:
      color: 8   # azure
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze the Input Grid:** Examine the input grid and identify all unique colors present.
2.  **Count Occurrences:** Count the number of pixels of each unique color.
3.  **Select Color:** The selected color is azure (8)
4.  **Create Output:** Create a 1x1 grid (single pixel) with the selected color (azure/8).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
