The output appears to be a single number, also representing a color (blue, in this instance). The task likely involves analyzing the colors present in the input grid and applying a rule to determine a single output color. There's a strong suggestion, looking just at the colors, that blue is the most important element of this task, as a blue pixel occurs and the result is also blue.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
