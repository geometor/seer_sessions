The input grid contains grey (5) pixels arranged in a specific pattern. The output grid maintains the same dimensions but alters the colors of some pixels.  Specifically, some grey pixels become blue (1), some become yellow (4), and some become red (2). The positions of other values, all white (0) remain unchanged. The transformation seems to be a color substitution based on the initial arrangement of the grey pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
