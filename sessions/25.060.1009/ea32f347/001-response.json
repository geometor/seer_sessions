The gray pixels form distinct contiguous shapes, and each of these shapes seems to be replaced by a differently colored shape. The new colored shapes occupy the location of the old shape. There isn't an obvious geometric transformation (rotation, scaling, reflection). The color change is the primary visual change. The replacement color is dependent on the shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The examples do a very good job to help with this.\n4.  **Output:** The output grid should have the same dimensions as the input grid, with the gray shapes replaced by corresponding colored lines, and the background unchanged.\n\nEssentially, the transformation maps gray shapes to colored lines based on the overall geometry of the gray shape, replacing all instances of the number '5' in a shape with another number based on the identified object's overall form..\n"
