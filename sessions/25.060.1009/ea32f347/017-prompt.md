Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Contiguous Gray Areas:** Locate all contiguous blocks of gray (5) pixels.
2.  **Classify Orientation:** Determine if each gray block is primarily horizontal or vertical. A horizontal block is wider than it is tall; a vertical block will be taller than it is wide.
3.  **Recolor Horizontal Blocks:** Change the color of horizontal gray blocks to blue (1) if they are at the top and red(2) if not.
4.  **Recolor Vertical Blocks:** Change the color of vertical gray blocks to yellow (4).
5.  **Leave other areas unchanged.** White (0) areas are not to be modified.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
