Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are 10x10 grids. The input grid contains vertical lines of grey (5) pixels, some extending to adjacent columns. The output grid seems to replace these grey pixels with different colors: blue (1), yellow (4), and red (2). The positioning of the colored lines appears to correspond directly to the grey lines in the input. The colors may have some relationship to the number of adjacent vertical lines.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    
  - type: pixel
    values:
      input: [0, 5]
      output: [0, 1, 2, 4]
    properties:
      color:
        0 : white
        1 : blue
        2 : red
        4 : yellow
        5 : grey

  - type: vertical_line
    properties:
        input_color: grey
        output_color: [blue, yellow, red]
        length: variable
    
actions:
  - type: replacement
    description: grey pixels in vertical lines are replaced by colored pixels
    input: grey (5)
    output: [blue(1), yellow(4), red(2)]

relationships:
  - type: spatial_correspondence
    description: the location of colored lines in the output corresponds to grey lines in the input

  - type: adjacent
    description: adjacent grey lines result in different color outputs

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all vertical lines of grey (5) pixels in the input grid. A vertical line is defined as a contiguous set of grey pixels in a single column.
2.  **Determine Output Color:** Based on the gray lines. It looks like isolated vertical lines get replaced by blue (1). If the line is next to another line on the right, the left is yellow (4). If a line has another line to it's right and is not the first line, it is red (2).
3.  **Replace** the grey pixels in each identified vertical line with the color determined in step 2, maintaining the original position and length of the line.
4.  **Leave** all other pixels (value 0) unchanged.

Essentially, we're recoloring grey vertical lines based on whether there are adjacent gray vertical lines, the color appears related to column position of vertical lines.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
