The input grid contains a shape formed by gray (5) pixels, while the output grid contains the same shape outline but with different colors: blue (1) for the vertical line, red (2) for the top horizontal segment, and yellow (4) for the bottom horizontal segment. The background is white (0) in both. The shape seems to be preserved, but the colors are changing based on the segment's position.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
