task_description: |
  Expand each cell in the input grid into a 3x3 block of the same color in the output grid.
objects:
  - object_name: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - cell_values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - role: source data
  - object_name: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - cell_values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - role: transformed data
      - dimensions: 3 times the input grid dimensions (both height and width)
  - object_name: cell
    properties:
      - type: single element within a grid
      - value: integer (0-9, representing a color)
      - role: basic unit of transformation
actions:
  - action_name: expand_cell
    description: Replicate a single cell from the input grid into a 3x3 block of the same value in the output grid.
    input: single cell (value)
    output: 3x3 block in output_grid
    transformation: |
      Input cell (i, j) with value 'color' becomes a 3x3 block in the output grid at position (3i, 3j) to (3i+2, 3j+2), where all cells in the block have the value 'color'.
