Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly handles the expansion of the grid by a factor of 3 and the basic transformation rule for white and orange pixels. However, it only considers two colors (white and orange) and a specific modification for orange pixels (top-left corner white). We need to generalize the approach to potentially handle other colors and patterns, if present in the other examples. The provided code has performed perfectly on all three provided training input and output examples. As a result, there will be very little update to the solution.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example and the code's performance:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 2x2 grid with white and orange pixels.
    *   Output: 6x6 grid, correctly expanding white and orange pixels, with the orange 3x3 blocks having a white pixel in the top-left corner.
    *   Result: Success. The code handles this case perfectly.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with just orange pixels.
    *   Output: 9x9 grid. All orange pixels in input are transformed into 3x3 blocks, each one with a white pixel on the top-left corner.
    *   Result: Success. The code performs correctly.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 1x1 with a white pixel.
    *   Output: 3x3, all white pixels
    *   Result: Success.

Since no errors were found and all examples performed as described, we can assume that the examples cover all possible scenarios for the transformation.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: pixel
    properties:
      color: [white, orange]
      original_position: [row, col] #original input grid position
      new_position: [3*row, 3*col]  # upper-left output subgrid
  - name: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [rows, cols]
  - name: output_grid
    properties:
       dimensions: [3*rows, 3*cols]
  - name: subgrid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3,3]
      color: same as pixel color
      top_left: white if original pixel is orange

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Each pixel in the input grid becomes a 3x3 block in the output grid.
  - name: modify_orange
    description: If a pixel is orange, the top-left pixel of its corresponding 3x3 block is set to white.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expansion:** The input grid is expanded to an output grid that is 3 times larger in both dimensions (height and width).
2.  **Pixel Transformation:** Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a 3x3 block of pixels in the output grid.
3.  **Color Replication:**
    *   If an input pixel is white (0), the entire corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid is filled with white pixels.
    *   If an input pixel is orange (7), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid is filled with orange pixels, EXCEPT for the top-left pixel of that block, which is set to white (0).
4. Other colors are ignored, but could be extended to include all other colors.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
