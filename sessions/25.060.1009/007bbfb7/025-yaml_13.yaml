facts:
  - object: 3x3 input grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: integers (colors)
  - object: 9x9 output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - values: integers (colors)
  - action: replication
    description: The 3x3 input grid is replicated nine times.
  - action: zeroing
    description: Specific rows within each replicated 3x3 block are set to 0 based on the block's position in the 3x3 grid of blocks.
  - observation: block_position
    description: The position (row and column index) of each 3x3 block within the overall 9x9 grid determines which rows are zeroed out.
  - observation: row_zeroing_rule
    description: >
      If the block is in the first row (block index 0), all rows except the first row of the input are zeroed.
      If the block is in the second row (block index 1), the first two rows of the input are replicated, the third row is zeros.
      If the block is in the third row (block index 2), all three rows of input are replicated.
