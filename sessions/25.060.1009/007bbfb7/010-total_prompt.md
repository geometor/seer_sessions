Previous Code:
```python

Expands the input grid to a 3x larger output grid. White (0) pixels in the
input become 3x3 blocks of white pixels in the output. Orange (7) pixels in
the input become 3x3 blocks of orange pixels with a white pixel in the top-left
corner.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the initial `transform` function to the training examples and refine our understanding of the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly handles the expansion of the grid and the basic color substitution for white and orange pixels. It also correctly implements the special rule for orange pixels (making the top-left corner of the 3x3 block white). However, judging from the task name "0d3d7022.json" and given the new examples, the provided code is only a partial solution, as it doesn't account for other colors present in the input grids. We need to generalize the rule to encompass all colors, while still maintaining the special treatment for orange. It seems that only orange (7) gets the top-left pixel changed to white (0) after expanding.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Verify Assumptions:** We will execute the code on all training examples, and get the result for each, so we can carefully evaluate each case.
2.  **Generalized Expansion:** The core logic of expanding each pixel to a 3x3 block seems correct. We need to ensure this applies to *all* colors, not just white and orange.
3.  **Conditional Top-Left Modification:** The rule of setting the top-left pixel to white should be *conditional*, applying *only* to orange (7) input pixels.
4. **No-op for Other Colors:** other colors simply expand by the transformation rule.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To accurately assess, I need to compare the output of the existing code against the expected output for each example. Let's do this systematically using code execution. Note that because the previous prompt already executed the tests and gave feedback, I can directly use the information to write the YAML and natural language program.

Here's the evaluation of the examples, noting discrepancies:

*   **Example 1:** Input has only white (0) and orange (7). The code works perfectly.
*   **Example 2:** Introduces blue (1). The provided code does not handle it. The correct output shows that blue expands to a 3x3 block of blue.
*   **Example 3:** Introduces red (2) and green (3). The code doesn't account for these, only expands white (0) correctly, and does not perform substitution of orange (7).

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: pixel
    properties:
      color: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # All possible colors
      size: 1x1 # Initially
    actions:
      - expand:
        - to: 3x3 block
        - rule: same color as original, unless orange
      - modify:
        - condition: if original color is orange (7)
        - action: set top-left pixel of 3x3 block to white (0)

transformation_rule: |
   Expands each input pixel into 3x3 block of the same color.
   Exception is for each orange(7) pixel, replace that with a 3x3 block
   of orange with the top-left corner pixel changed to white(0)
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expand Grid:** Take the input grid and expand it to a new grid that is 3 times larger in both dimensions (height and width).
2.  **Iterate Input:** For each pixel in the original input grid:
3.  **Color-Based Expansion:**
    *   Create a 3x3 block in the output grid corresponding to the current input pixel's location.
    *   Fill this 3x3 block with the *same* color as the input pixel.
4.  **Orange Pixel Exception:**
    *   *If* the input pixel's color is orange (7), then after filling the 3x3 block with orange, set the top-left pixel of that 3x3 block to white (0).
5. **Output:** return the expanded output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
