Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (9x9). The colors involved are red (2) and white (0). The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input grid, with the pattern replicated and potentially padded with white (0) pixels. The relationship between the input grid size and the output grid size is that the output dimensions are three times the input dimensions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_size: 3x3
  - output_grid_size: 9x9
  - colors:
    - 0: white
    - 2: red
  - input_pattern: |
      2 2 2
      0 0 0
      0 2 2
  - observation: output grid is an expanded version of the input grid.
  - size_relationship: output_dimension = 3 * input_dimension
  - padding: White (0) pixels are used to fill the expanded grid around the replicated input pattern.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expand Dimensions:** Multiply both the width and height of the input grid by 3 to determine the output grid's dimensions.

2.  **Replicate Pattern:** For the non zero values copy it into three different rows.

3.  **Fill Padding:** Fill the newly created cells of output grid with zeros

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
