The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid. The primary colors involved are white (0) and red (2). The output grid appears to be an expanded version of the input grid, with some systematic replication and placement of the red pixels. The significant change is the size, and the repeating pattern of red pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
