Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is expanded into a larger grid where each original pixel becomes a 3x3 block. The color of each 3x3 block in the output grid is the same as the color of the corresponding pixel in the input grid. For example, if a pixel in the input grid is blue, the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid will be entirely blue. If a pixel is white, its 3x3 block will be white. This applies to all colors and pixels in the input grid.

    input_rows, input_cols = input_grid.shape
    output_rows, output_cols = input_rows * 3, input_cols * 3

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
