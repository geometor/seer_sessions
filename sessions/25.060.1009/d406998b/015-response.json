The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors observed are 0 (white), 5 (gray), and 3 (green). The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of some pixels. It looks like all instances of the number '5' in the top left quadrant are replaced by the number '3'.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

A simple way of describing 'top-left quadrant' is to restrict changes to pixels where row index is less than number of rows /2 and the col index is less than the number of cols / 2.\n\n3. **Conditional Replacement**\n    - if gray pixel is in top-left quadrant, replace the value of gray pixel from 5 to 3.\n\n4.  **Output:** Produce the modified grid, where identified gray pixels in the top-left quadrant have been replaced with green pixels. The rest remain unchanged.\n"
