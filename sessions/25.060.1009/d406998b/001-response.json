The dominant colors are white (0) and gray (5). The transformation seems to selectively replace some gray (5) pixels with green (3) pixels, while leaving others unchanged. The key is to discern the pattern or rule determining *which* gray pixels are changed. The overall grid dimensions remain constant between input and output. There aren't any obvious geometric transformations like rotations or reflections.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
