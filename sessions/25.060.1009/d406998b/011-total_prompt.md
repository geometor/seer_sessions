Previous Code:
```python
"""
Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
Identify gray (5) pixels.
Check location of gray pixel against this pattern
    *   If the gray pixel is in the first row and it's the second or fourth gray pixel of the row, change it to green (3).
    *   If the gray pixel is in the second row, and it's the third gray pixel of the row, change it to green (3).
    *   If the gray pixel is in the third row, and it's the second or fourth gray pixel of the row, change it to green (3).
Leave all other pixels (white or already green) unchanged.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
