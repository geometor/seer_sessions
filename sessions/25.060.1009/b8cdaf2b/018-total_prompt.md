Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), blue (1), and magenta (6). The input grid transforms into a modified output grid. The most noticeable change occurs in the upper portion of the grid. It also appears the output grid maintains the structure and colors of the bottom two rows.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 5
      columns: 5
      colors: [0, 1, 6]
  - type: object_group_1
    properties:
        color: 0
        location: rows 1-3, all columns
  - type: object_group_2
    properties:
        color: [1,6]
        location: rows 4-5, all columns

actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: unknown
    target: object_group_1
    parameters:
        row_select: 3
        color_select: [1,0]
        pattern_select: ends

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: object group 1 is above object group 2

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** The input grid can be conceptually divided into two regions:
    *   An upper region consisting of the first three rows (all white, color 0).
    *   A lower region consisting of the last two rows (a row of magenta and blue, then another row of magenta, blue and magenta).

2.  **Preserve Lower Region:** The lower region remains unchanged in the output.

3.  **Transform Upper Region:**
    *   Examine the third row.
    *   The outermost pixels in row 3 change to blue (value 1).
    *   Other pixels in row 3 stay white (0).
    * The first two rows do not change.

In essence, the transformation "flags" the ends of the 3rd row by changing the white to blue.. The rest of the grid remains the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
