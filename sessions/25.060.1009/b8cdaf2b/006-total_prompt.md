**input:**
```
0 0 0
0 2 0
2 4 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7FC253D7D5D0>

**output:**
```
4 0 4
0 2 0
2 4 2
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of pixels. Each pixel has a numerical value representing a color (0: white, 2: red, 4: yellow). The transformation seems to involve a change in the top row.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: numerical value (0, 2, 4)

actions:
  - type: replace_color
    location: top row
    condition: 
      original_color: 0
      new_color: 4

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: pixels are adjacent horizontally and vertically.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Identify:** Focus on the 3x3 grid of pixels.
2.  **Locate:** Specifically target the top row of the grid.
3.  **Conditional Replacement:** If a pixel in the top row has the color value 0 (white), replace it with the color value 4 (yellow).
4. **Preservation:** All other pixels, including those not in the top row or those in the top row that doesn't equal to 0, retain their original color values.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
