Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Copy Bottom Rows:** Copy the bottom two rows (rows 4 and 5) of the input grid directly to the output grid, preserving all pixel values and positions.

2.  **Identify Center and Non Zero pixels in top rows:**
    *   Find the center cell of the entire grid (row 3, column 3).
    *   Find any non-zero pixels that are present in the top 3 rows.

3. **Add Mirrored Pixels based on top rows:** In the top three rows, for any existing non-zero pixel, add a corresponding pixel of same color in the mirrored location. For a pixel is at (r,c) a mirrored position would be also found at (r, 6-c).

4. **Fill the rest with 0:** All other cells that weren't affected are filled with 0 (white)

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
