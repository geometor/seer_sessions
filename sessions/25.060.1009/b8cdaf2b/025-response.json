            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code and update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code focused on identifying a red and yellow structure at the bottom of the input grid and placing yellow pixels a few rows above based on the presence of yellow pixels in that structure. This approach works for the first training example but fails for the others. The other examples show a different pattern, which is triggered by the location of yellow pixels. The updated solution should generalize to the other examples and potential future examples.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Shift Focus:** Instead of focusing on a bottom structure of specific colors, direct attention to the locations of all yellow pixels in input grid, to use these to trigger the output.\n\n2.  **Generalized Rule:** Establish a more general rule that accounts for the positioning of yellow pixels.\n\n**Example and Result Metrics:**\n\nTo better understand the patterns, let's collect some metrics. I'll use the provided color mapping for clarity.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Yellow Pixels Input: `[(7, 3), (7, 7)]`\n    *   Yellow Pixels Output: `[(4, 3), (5, 3), (4, 7), (5, 7)]`\n    *   Observation from input: two columns with yellow, at the bottom of the grid\n    *   Result: Correct.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Yellow Pixels Input: `[(5, 4), (5, 5)]`\n    *   Yellow Pixels Output: `[(2, 4), (3, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5)]`\n    *   Observation from input: two columns with yellow, two rows from bottom\n    *   Result: Incorrect. Output is all zeros.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Yellow Pixels Input: `[(2, 6), (2, 7)]`\n    *   Yellow Pixels Output: `[(8, 6), (7, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7)]`\n        *(note row numbers increase \"down\" the grid, so row 7 is above 8)*\n    *   Observation from input: two columns with yellow, two rows from top\n    *   Result: Incorrect. Output is all zeros.\n\n**YAML Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example: 1\n    input_yellow_pixels:  \"[(7, 3), (7, 7)]\"\n    output_yellow_pixels: \"[(4, 3), (5, 3), (4, 7), (5, 7)]\"\n    rule: \"For each column containing a yellow pixel, two yellow pixels are added three and two rows above the highest row that contains a yellow.\"\n    result: \"Correct\"\n\n  - example: 2\n    input_yellow_pixels:  \"[(5, 4), (5, 5)]\"\n    output_yellow_pixels: \"[(2, 4), (3, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5)]\"\n    rule: \"For each column containing a yellow pixel, two yellow pixels are added three and two rows above the highest row that contains a yellow.\"\n    result: \"Incorrect\"\n\n  - example: 3\n    input_yellow_pixels:  \"[(2, 6), (2, 7)]`\n    output_yellow_pixels: \"[(8, 6), (7, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7)]\"\n    rule: \"For each column containing a yellow pixel, two yellow pixels are added three and two rows below the lowest row that contains a yellow.\"\n    result: \"Incorrect\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find Yellow Pixels:** Identify all pixels in the input grid that are yellow (value 4).\n\n2.  **Determine Target Rows:** For each column that contains one or more yellow pixels, calculate two target row indices:\n    *   `target_row_1 = min(yellow_row_indices) - 3`\n    *   `target_row_2 = min(yellow_row_indices) - 2`\n\n3.  **Place Yellow Pixels:** If the calculated target row indices are within the grid boundaries place a yellow pixel in each of the identified columns at both target rows.\n\n4. Leave other pixels unchanged.\n\n**Explanation of Revisions and Logic:**\n\n*   The core logic has changed. The initial approach assumed a specific structure at the bottom. The new logic focuses on all yellow pixels, their locations, and uses that for output.\n*   The code now finds *all* yellow pixels in the grid, rather than just the bottom.\n*   The yellow pixels are placed at a location relative to the position of the original yellow pixels.\n"
