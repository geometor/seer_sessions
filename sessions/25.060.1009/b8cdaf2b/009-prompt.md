Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Examine the Input Grid:** Consider the entire input grid as a collection of individual pixels, each with a color value.
2.  **Focus on the Top Row:**  Directly target the pixels located in the first row (row index 0) of the grid.
3.  **Conditional Color Change:** For each pixel in the top row, check if its color value is 0 (white). If it is, change its color value to 4 (yellow).
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All pixels *not* in the top row, and any pixels in the top row that are *not* white, remain unchanged. Their original color values are preserved.

The transformation can be summarized as: "Change white pixels to yellow, but only in the top row of the grid."
"""

    # initialize output_grid as a copy of the input
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Iterate through the pixels of the top row (row index 0).
    for x in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
      # Check if the pixel's color is white (0).
      if output_grid[0, x] == 0:
        # replace the pixel with yellow (4)
        output_grid[0,x] = 4
    
    #return the modified grid
    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
