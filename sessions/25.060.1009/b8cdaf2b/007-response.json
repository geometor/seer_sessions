            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, and correctly identified the basic operation: changing white pixels in the top row to yellow. However, it's crucial to examine *all* examples to ensure the rule is universally applicable. The results show that the code functions as expected. The strategy now is to simply confirm the previous observations and present the deliverables in the requested format.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo be absolutely certain, I will manually inspect each input/output pair.\nI don't need code execution since manual inspection suffices for this relatively simple task.\n\n**Example Analysis and Results**\n*Example 1*\n- input:\n```\n[[0 0 0]\n [0 5 5]\n [0 5 0]]\n```\n- expected output:\n```\n[[4 4 4]\n [0 5 5]\n [0 5 0]]\n```\n- actual output:\n```\n[[4 4 4]\n [0 5 5]\n [0 5 0]]\n```\n- result - Pass\n\n*Example 2*\n- input:\n```\n[[0 0 0 1 0]\n [0 5 5 0 0]\n [0 5 0 2 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0]]\n```\n- expected output:\n```\n[[4 4 4 1 4]\n [0 5 5 0 0]\n [0 5 0 2 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0]]\n```\n- actual output:\n```\n[[4 4 4 1 4]\n [0 5 5 0 0]\n [0 5 0 2 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0]]\n```\n- result: Pass\n\n*Example 3*\n- input:\n```\n[[8 0 0]\n [0 5 5]\n [0 5 0]]\n```\n- expected output:\n```\n[[8 4 4]\n [0 5 5]\n [0 5 0]]\n```\n- actual output:\n```\n[[8 4 4]\n [0 5 5]\n [0 5 0]]\n```\n- result: Pass\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array\n      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n  - object: pixels\n    properties:\n      - type: individual elements within the grid\n      - attribute: color (represented by an integer)\n      - location: (row, column) coordinates\n  - action: conditional_replacement\n    conditions:\n      - location: top row of the grid (row index 0)\n      - initial_color: white (value 0)\n    transformation:\n      - new_color: yellow (value 4)\n    scope: affects only pixels meeting both conditions\n  - action: preservation\n        properties:\n          description: keep cells unchanged that don't match conditional replacement rule\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Examine the Input Grid:** Consider the entire input grid as a collection of individual pixels, each with a color value.\n2.  **Focus on the Top Row:**  Directly target the pixels located in the first row (row index 0) of the grid.\n3.  **Conditional Color Change:** For each pixel in the top row, check if its color value is 0 (white). If it is, change its color value to 4 (yellow).\n4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All pixels *not* in the top row, and any pixels in the top row that are *not* white, remain unchanged. Their original color values are preserved.\n\nThe transformation can be summarized as: \"Change white pixels to yellow, but only in the top row of the grid.\"\n"
