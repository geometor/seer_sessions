1.  **Examine the Input Grid:** Consider the entire input grid as a collection of individual pixels, each with a color value.
2.  **Focus on the Top Row:**  Directly target the pixels located in the first row (row index 0) of the grid.
3.  **Conditional Color Change:** For each pixel in the top row, check if its color value is 0 (white). If it is, change its color value to 4 (yellow).
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All pixels *not* in the top row, and any pixels in the top row that are *not* white, remain unchanged. Their original color values are preserved.

The transformation can be summarized as: "Change white pixels to yellow, but only in the top row of the grid."
