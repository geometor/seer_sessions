The input grids consistently transform into output grids of the same dimensions. The transformation isn't a simple global operation (like changing all instances of one color to another). It appears to be context-sensitive, meaning the change of a pixel depends on its neighbors or its position within the grid. The most visually prominent change is often the alteration of pixels near, but not part of, the bottom two rows.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
