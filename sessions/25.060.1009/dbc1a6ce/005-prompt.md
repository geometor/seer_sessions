Previous Code:
```python
"""
For each blue (1) pixel in the input grid, draw an azure (8) cross centered on the blue pixel.
The original blue pixel remains unchanged. Other pixels also remain unchanged.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by drawing an azure cross around each blue pixel.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Find all blue pixels
    blue_pixels = np.argwhere(input_grid == 1)

    # For each blue pixel, draw an azure cross
    for row, col in blue_pixels:
        # Place azure pixels adjacent to the blue pixel

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
