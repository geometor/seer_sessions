The primary colors observed are white (0) and blue (1). The transformation seems to involve introducing a new color, azure (8), in relation to the existing blue pixels. The azure color appears to \"fill\" areas adjacent to the blue pixels, forming a cross-like shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
