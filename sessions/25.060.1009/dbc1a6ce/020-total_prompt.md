Train Set Results:
Here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed revisions to the natural language program and the YAML fact documentation:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were a good first attempt, focusing on blue pixels and their immediate neighbors. However, the execution on the full training set reveals a critical flaw: the program incorrectly adds azure pixels around *all* blue pixels that *don't* have adjacent blues, and the code doesn't handle existing non-white/non-blue neighbors correctly.

The core issue is a misunderstanding of *when* to add the azure expansion. It's not simply the absence of an adjacent blue, but a more complex condition. It appears that expansion only happens when single blue objects have open white space, and that multi-blue-pixel objects are turned completely into azure, but no expansion happens.

The strategy to resolve this is:

1.  **Refine Object Identification:**  The code needs to differentiate between isolated single blue pixels and connected blue pixel groups.  This requires a concept of "connected components" or "objects."
2.  **Conditional Expansion:**  The expansion with azure should only occur around *single*, *isolated* blue pixels, and *only* into white cells.
3.  **Multi-pixel Object Handling**: If a blue pixel is part of a larger connected blue component, change the *entire* component to azure.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where applicable)**
Because the provided results are images and not machine readable, a
programmatic assessment is not really practical. However, I can still provide a
good assessment based on what I can see from the images.

*   **Example 1:**  The code works correctly.
*   **Example 2:**  Fails. The code *adds* azure around the 2x1 blue area, it should simply convert the two pixels to azure without expansion. It also adds azure to the right of a single blue, but it shouldn't as it is adjacent to a green cell, not a white cell.
*   **Example 3:** Fails. The code adds azure around the top left 2x1 blue area, but should have just converted the existing blues. The existing blue object is incorrectly expanded by adding azure.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel_group
    color: blue
    properties:
      - connected:  # Indicates whether pixels are directly adjacent (cardinally)
          - True   # For groups of 2 or more
          - False  # For isolated single pixels
      - expandable: #indicates if adjacent to a white pixel
          - True #if there are white pixels adjacent, then this object is expandable
          - False #if no white pixels, the object is not expandable

actions:
  - name: transform_color
    input_object: pixel_group
    input_color: blue
    output_color: azure
    conditions:
      - connected: True  # Transform the entire group if connected.
      - connected: False # Only transform the single blue.
  - name: expand
    input_object: pixel_group
    input_color: blue
    output_color: azure
    conditions:
      - connected: False
      - expandable: True
      - adjacent_color: white # Only expand into white cells.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Blue Pixel Groups:** Find all groups of connected blue pixels.  Two blue pixels are considered connected if they are cardinally adjacent (up, down, left, or right). A single, isolated blue pixel is also considered its own group.

2.  **Process Each Group:** For each identified blue pixel group:
    *   **If the group contains more than one blue pixel (connected = True):** Change all pixels within that group to azure (8).
    *   **If the group contains only a single blue pixel (connected = False):**
        * Change the single blue to azure
        * **Check for adjacent white (0) pixels:**  For each cardinally adjacent cell that is white (0), add an azure (8) pixel in that cell.

This revised natural language program provides a much more accurate and nuanced description of the transformation, addressing the identified issues in the previous iteration. It introduces the crucial concept of connected groups, and the conditional logic.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
