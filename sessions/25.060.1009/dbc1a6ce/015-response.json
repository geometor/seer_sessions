The output grid introduces azure (8) pixels while retaining some of the original blue and white pixels.\n*   **Shapes:** The blue pixels in the input appear to form disconnected single-pixel objects or small clusters.\n*   **Transformation:** The azure (8) pixels in the output seem to be related to the blue (1) pixels in the input, often appearing adjacent to them, sometimes replacing them, and sometimes extending from them. The azure pixels seem to \"fill in\" areas around the blue pixels, especially making a \"cross\" with the blue pixel in the center.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

If the original blue pixel had *any* adjacent blue pixels, replace all original directly-adjacent blue pixels with an azure pixel.\n\nIn summary: It creates a cross of azure pixels centered on blue pixels, with one-pixel padding around blue pixels when the blue pixels aren't touching other blue pixels. If blue pixels are touching other blue pixels, the blue pixels are turned into azure pixels.\n"
