Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to discern the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing pixels of two colors: black (0) and blue (1). The transformation appears to involve a third color: azure (8). The azure pixels seem to be related to the blue pixels in the input, expanding or connecting them in some way. The shapes formed by the azure pixels are always lines and there is at least one azure pixel adjacent to each blue pixel.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_pixel
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - static: true
  - name: azure_pixel
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - dynamic: true # Appears in the output, not the input
      - adjacent_to: blue_pixel # Always next to at least one blue pixel
  - name: black_pixel
    color: black (0)
    properties:
        - static: true
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [blue_pixel, azure_pixel]
  - type: fill
    agent: azure_pixel
    target: space_between_blue_pixels
actions:
  - name: connect
    agent: azure_pixel
    description: Forms lines connecting blue pixels
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all blue pixels (value 1) in the input grid.
2.  **Analyze** positions of the blue pixels.
3.  **Connect/Flood** the blue pixels with azure pixels (value 8) using horizontal and vertical lines. If any blue pixels exist on a horizontal, vertical path, the empty space separating them becomes filled by connecting them with azure pixels.

Essentially azure pixels fill empty cells (0s) that are on a straight line connecting the blue cells, and a single azure pixel appears adjacent to each blue cell.
