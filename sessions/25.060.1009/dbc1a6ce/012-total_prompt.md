Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the initial transformation rule to the training examples and refine our understanding of the task.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a horizontal fill operation, changing white (0) pixels to azure (8) adjacent to blue (1) pixels. The provided results show that this rule works perfectly for the first example, but fails in all other examples. This suggests that the core concept of "filling adjacent pixels" is relevant, but the *conditions* and *direction* of the fill are likely incorrect or incomplete. The other examples provide crucial information to refine these aspects. My strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze each example pair:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output of each example. Identify where the current rule succeeds and, more importantly, where it fails.
2.  **Identify patterns of failure:** Look for commonalities in the errors. Are we missing a specific color condition? Is the fill direction incorrect? Are there other objects or spatial relationships influencing the transformation?
3.  **Refine the natural language program:** Based on the error analysis, adjust the natural language program to accurately reflect the observed transformations.
4.  **Re-evaluate based on results:** Keep track of the results and how they diverge from my expectations.
5.  **Prepare comprehensive YAML and program:** Use the information gather, to prepare the deliverables

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution when appropriate):**

Since I cannot directly execute code, I'll describe the analysis that *would* be done and present the expected observations. I'll use a notation `(row, col): value` to denote pixel values.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input matches output: True.
    *   Observations: The initial rule works perfectly here. Blue (1) triggers horizontal filling of white (0) with azure (8).

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input matches output: False.
    *   Expected Output Analysis:
        *   `(0,0): 0` becomes `8`, `(1,0):0` becomes `8`, `(0,1):0` becomes `8`. `(1,1):1` remains. This suggests filling adjacent to blue in all directions, not just horizontally.

    *   Actual Output Analysis (based on the provided code's behavior):
        *    The actual output will be the same as example 1.

    *   Observations: The fill should occur vertically as well as horizontally.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input matches output: False.

    *   Expected output analysis:
        *    Only adjacent white pixels are changed to azure.

    *   Actual Output Analysis (based on the provided code's behavior):
        *   Horizontal fill only, triggered by the blue (1) pixel.

    *   Observations: Supports the observation from Example 2: all-directional adjacency matters.

*    **Example 4:**
    *   Input matches output: False.

    *   Expected output analysis:
         *    Only adjacent white pixels are changed to azure.

    *   Actual Output Analysis (based on the provided code's behavior):
        *   Horizontal fill only, triggered by the blue (1) pixel.

    *   Observations: Supports the observation from Example 2 & 3: all-directional adjacency matters.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_pixel
    color: blue
    value: 1
    role: trigger

  - name: white_pixel
    color: white
    value: 0
    role: target

  - name: azure_pixel
    color: azure
    value: 8
    role: replacement

actions:
  - name: fill
    trigger: blue_pixel
    target: white_pixel
    replacement: azure_pixel
    condition: adjacency
    direction: all

adjacency:
    description: Pixels sharing a side, not just diagonal.
```

**Natural Language Program**

Identify blue (1) pixels. For each blue pixel, change any adjacent (sharing a side) white (0) pixels to azure (8). Adjacency includes all four directions: up, down, left, and right.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
