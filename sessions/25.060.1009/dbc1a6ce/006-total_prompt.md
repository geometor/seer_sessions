Previous Code:
```python
"""
For each blue (1) pixel in the input grid, draw an azure (8) cross centered on the blue pixel.
The original blue pixel remains unchanged. Other pixels also remain unchanged.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by drawing an azure cross around each blue pixel.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Find all blue pixels
    blue_pixels = np.argwhere(input_grid == 1)

    # For each blue pixel, draw an azure cross
    for row, col in blue_pixels:
        # Place azure pixels adjacent to the blue pixel
        if row > 0:
            output_grid[row - 1, col] = 8  # Above
        if row < rows - 1:
            output_grid[row + 1, col] = 8  # Below
        if col > 0:
            output_grid[row, col - 1] = 8  # Left
        if col < cols - 1:
            output_grid[row, col + 1] = 8  # Right
        if row > 0 and col > 0: # Top Left

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on the observation of the first training example. It assumed that an azure cross (including diagonals) should be drawn around *every* blue pixel. However, the testing of all the examples shows it is incomplete and inaccurate. The diagonal part of the azure cross is incorrect.

The strategy to resolve this is as follows:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Examine each input-output pair, focusing on how blue pixels are transformed and how the surrounding pixels change (or don't change).
2.  **Metrics Gathering:** Use code execution to generate precise reports on the characteristics of input and output grids, like location of changes, dimensions, and colors.
3.  **Fact Identification:** Extract key facts about objects, their properties, and relationships (e.g., "blue pixels," "azure cross," adjacency). Create YAML block of facts.
4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the accumulated evidence, update the natural language program to accurately and completely describe the transformation rule. Specifically, fix the error regarding the diagonals.
5. **Verify that we did not change input:** check the values of changed pixels

**Metrics Gathering and Example Analysis**

I'll use `code_execution` to produce reports for each example.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
