The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), and magenta (6). The transformation seems to involve a downward movement and potential duplication/creation of magenta (6) pixels based on the position of existing azure (8) and magenta (6) pixels. The shape defined by the azure pixels remains, but is shifted down.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

By inspecting the difference between the lowest azure pixel and lowest magenta pixel, we determine that shape moves by exactly one row.\n\n3. **Find Endpoints for magenta:** Determine the locations on the original input to perform a fill of the color magenta: In this example, two are found: the cell just below the single isolated magenta block, and the vertical range between the lowest azure position and lowest, non-white, position (the magenta cell).\n\n4. **Fill Magenta Vertically:** Fill color magenta from each identified endpoint down to the row before the lowest existing magenta (including original magenta position).\n\nIn simpler terms, copy the azure shape one row down. Any column that *was* filled to any depth by azure in the original shape, receives a magenta color vertically, starting at the bottom of the azure shape, all the way down until the last non-white cell. The rest of the output cells from the input are unchanged.\n"
