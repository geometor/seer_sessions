objects:
  - type: region
    properties:
      colors: [non-background]
      shape: contiguous
      bounds: bounding_box  # Initial assumption, may need revision
      adjacent_regions: [background] # Regions with color 0

actions:
  - name: find_bounding_box
    input: region
    output: bounding_box coordinates
  - name: identify_seed # rename from "top_left_pixel"
    input: region, bounding_box
    output: color
  - name: expand
    input: seed_color, adjacent_region
    output: modified_grid
    notes: expands the seed color into the background adjacent to all objects
