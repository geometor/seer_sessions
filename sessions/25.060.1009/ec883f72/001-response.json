Here's a breakdown of my observations, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The primary change seems to involve adding or repositioning certain colored pixels while leaving most of the grid unchanged. The significant changes appear to relate to shapes or connected regions of non-zero pixels. There's a possible interaction or relationship between different colored regions within the grid. In some cases, a color appears to be 'moved' to a new, empty location based on the presence of other colored objects.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Look for \"background-colored\" regions (value 0) which are *adjacent* to any part of the *boundary* of any \"colored region\". We will call the largest such white region the *target region*.\n3. **Determine Movement/Addition:**\n    * For the \"topmost\", and \"leftmost\" non-background colored pixel within the smallest rectangle that encloses *all* the non-background pixels: If there's an \"empty\", background colored (value 0) *target region*, add *or move* copies of that pixel's *color* into the target region.\n4.  **Place Color**\n    - If multiple copies of the target color are needed, place them along the *boundary* of the target area so that it matches its original orientation (i.e. top/left justified if the original was in the top/left).\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies a particular colored pixel within the original grid, and then duplicates or moves that color to a new, empty location that is adjacent to one of the color regions, and then orients these new pixels along the top or left boundary of the empty region.\n"
