Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Existing Objects:** Locate the yellow (4) structure and any red (2) pixels/structures within the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Existing:** Copy the existing yellow structure and any existing red pixels/structures to the output grid without modification.
3. **Determine Base Row for new Red:**
    *   Find the highest row (minimum y-coordinate) occupied by the yellow structure.
    *   Calculate the base row for the new red pixels: two rows above the highest yellow row. Ensure that the calculated base row is not negative (minimum value of 0).
4.  **Determine Columns, if red exists**
      * Find existing red objects and the min and max column
5. **Determine Columns, if no red exists:**
      * Use first column (0) and last column - 1, ensure not negative
6.  **Add New Red Pixels:** Create two new red (2) pixels. Place these new pixels on the calculated base row. If there are pre-existing red pixels/shapes, align the newly created pixels to be in a row with the first and last column of red. If there are no pre-existing red pixels/shapes, place them in column 0 and at the second-to-last column of the output grid (width - 2).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
