            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and formulate an updated natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example and made a specific assumption: identify a yellow block, clear the area above it, and place a single yellow pixel in the top-right corner, based on the width of the original yellow object. This approach works for the first example but fails to generalize to the others. The other examples show that the transformation isn't solely about a yellow object. We need to consider other aspects, such as consistent changes across all examples, not just those related to yellow pixels. The strategy should be to identify the *common* transformation logic across *all* examples and avoid being overly influenced by a single case.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution, where necessary, but mostly visual inspection for this simple case):**\n\nLet's review each example.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Yellow block present.\n    *   Output: Yellow pixel at top right, lower section is the same.\n    *   Code Result: Correct.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: No yellow block. Other colors.\n    *   Output: Top rows cleared; lower rows same as input\n    *   Code Result: Incorrect. Nothing changes, because not yellow is found.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: Yellow and other objects.\n    *   Output: Yellow block moved to top, lower sections the same.\n    *   Code Result: Incorrect. The entire area above the yellow object is cleared, not just a portion.\n\nBased on visual inspection and code results the errors observed are:\n1.  The assumption that the transformation logic is related to only yellow\n    colored objects.\n2.  The calculation of the \"Displacement\" is incorrect, as it assumes the output\n    must be 1 pixel and in the top-right.\n3.  The assumption about the relation of the area above the object is wrong.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_1:\n      input:\n        objects:\n          - color: yellow\n            shape: rectangle\n            position:\n              top_left: [2, 2]\n              bottom_right: [4, 7]\n      output:\n        objects:\n          - color: yellow\n            shape: single pixel\n            position:\n              top_left: [0, 7] # same as [0,7]\n              bottom_right: [0, 7]\n        transformation:\n          - action: clear_above\n            area: input.rows_above_object.yellow\n          - action: move_object\n            object: yellow_rectangle\n            destination: top_right, adjusted for width.\n  - example_2:\n      input:\n        objects:\n          - color: blue\n            shape: rectangle\n            position: [2,0] - [2,8]\n          - color: green\n            shape: rectangle\n            position: [3,0] - [3,8]\n          - color: red\n            shape: rectangle\n            position: [4,0] - [4,8]\n\n      output:\n          - color: blue\n            shape: rectangle\n            position: [2,0] - [2,8]\n          - color: green\n            shape: rectangle\n            position: [3,0] - [3,8]\n          - color: red\n            shape: rectangle\n            position: [4,0] - [4,8]\n        transformation:\n          - action: clear_above\n            area: input.rows_above: 2\n\n  - example_3:\n      input:\n        objects:\n          - color: yellow\n            shape: rectangle\n            position: [4,0] - [6,2]\n          - color: grey\n            shape: rectangle\n            position: [7,0] - [7,2]\n      output:\n        objects:\n        - color: yellow\n          shape: rectangle\n          position: [0,0] - [2,2]\n        - color: grey\n          shape: rectangle\n          position: [7,0] - [7,2]\n        transformation:\n          - action: clear_above\n            area: input.rows_above_object.yellow\n          - action: move_object\n            object: yellow\n            destination: top_left, adjusted for object shape\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify a dividing line:** Find the highest row index `r` that contains a non-zero pixel.\n2.  **Preserve the bottom:** Keep all rows from `r` to the bottom of the grid unchanged in the output grid.\n3. Find the object at the dividing line\n4.  **Clear above object:** Clear any pixels in the rows above object.\n5. Move the object to the top of the grid.\n\nThe core idea is a consistent \"preserve bottom, clear and move top\" rule. The critical insight is recognizing that the lower part of the input *always* remains identical in the output. The challenge is identifying the correct dividing line.\n"
