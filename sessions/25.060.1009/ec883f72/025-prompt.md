Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program identifies a yellow block, maintains the lower region of the image,
and places a yellow pixel in the top-right corner of the grid, mirroring its
original relative position by only using the top-right pixel of that position.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_object(grid, color):
    # Find the coordinates of all pixels of the given color.
    coords = np.argwhere(grid == color)
    if coords.size == 0:
        return None, None, None, None
    # Calculate the bounding box.
    min_row, min_col = coords.min(axis=0)
    max_row, max_col = coords.max(axis=0)
    return min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    
    # Find the yellow (4) object.
    min_row_y, min_col_y, max_row_y, max_col_y = find_object(input_grid, 4)

    if min_row_y is None:
        return output_grid

    # "Displacement"
    grid_height, grid_width = input_grid.shape

    new_x = grid_width - (max_col_y - min_col_y +1)  #+ min_col_y
    new_y = 0

    # Place the yellow pixel
    output_grid[:min_row_y, :] = 0
    if 0 <= new_x < grid_width and 0 <= new_y < grid_height:  # Ensure within bounds

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
