Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Existing Objects:** Locate the existing yellow (4) structure and the red (2) square within it.
2. **Preserve:** Keep the yellow structure and red square to the output.
3. **Determine New Pixel Locations:**
    *   Find the highest row (minimum y-coordinate) occupied by the yellow structure.
    *   Place the first new red pixel two row above the highest row of the yellow structure, and at the very beginning of that row (index 0).
    *   Place the second new red pixel two rows above the highest row of the yellow structure, and one row before the very last entry of that row.
4. **Add New Pixels:** Create two new red (2) pixels at the calculated locations.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
