The primary colors observed are white (0), yellow (4), and red (2). The input grid seems to contain two distinct objects: a larger yellow structure and a smaller red square within it. The output grid maintains the yellow and red structures but introduces two new, isolated red pixels in the top right quadrant of the grid, while keeping other part the same as input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
