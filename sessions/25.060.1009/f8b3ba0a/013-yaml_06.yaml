  - task: "Extract unique colors from input grid and arrange them vertically."
  - objects:
      - type: "grid"
        properties: "2D array of color values (0-9)"
      - type: "color"
        properties: "integer value representing a specific color"
  - actions:

        description: "Identify all unique color values present in the input grid, excluding the background color (0)."
      - name: "order_colors"
        description: "Order the extracted colors based on their appearance in the input grid, following a top-to-bottom, left-to-right reading order."
      - name: "create_output"
        description: "Construct a new grid with a single column, where each row contains one of the ordered colors."
  - input: "2D array (grid) of color values"
  - output: "2D array (grid) with a single column, containing the ordered unique colors from the input."
  - constraints:
      - "The background color (0) should be ignored."
      - "The order of colors in the output should correspond to the top-to-bottom, left-to-right reading order of their first appearance in the input."
  - errors:
    - "The original code only considered colors in the first non-empty column"
