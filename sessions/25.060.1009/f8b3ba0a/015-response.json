The output appears to be a sequence of single-digit numbers, each corresponding to a color. There are repeating horizontal lines of '0' values. The relevant data is in blocks between the solid white (0) lines. Inside those blocks, there are pairs of colored blocks, each is a different color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
