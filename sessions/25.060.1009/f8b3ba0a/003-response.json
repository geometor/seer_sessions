The output is a 3x1 grid containing the digits 4, 2, and 3. The input grid seems to have several distinct colored regions (represented by non-zero digits) surrounded by background pixels of color 0 (white). The output grid lists some colors in single cells. The output colors match some of the input colors. The order might matter. Let's check the location of these color regions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider pixels to be part of the same region if they share a side (not just a corner).\n2.  **Extract Specific Colors:** From the identified colored regions, find and take note of the color value of the topmost, leftmost pixel of any region with colors yellow (4), red (2) and green (3).\n3. Order the Colors by row: Order the collected color values based on which rows they appear, starting at the top.\n4.  **Create Output:** Construct a 3x1 output grid. Fill each cell of the output grid, top to bottom, with each color from the list, starting with the row with smallest number.\n\n"
