Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Blocks:** Scan the input grid to find all 2x2 square regions where all four pixels have the same non-zero color.
2. **Ignore Background:** Disregard any rows that consist entirely of '0' (white) pixels.
3. **Extract Color:** For each identified 2x2 block, record the color value (the number) of the pixels within that block.
4. **Order Colors:** Sort the extracted color in ascending order by the row that they appear. The first one appears on row 4, the second on row 8, and the third on row 10.
5. **Build Output:** Create an output sequence which contains the sorted colors, where each is a separate entry presented as single stacked values.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program focused on identifying 2x2 blocks of the same non-zero color, extracting their colors, and ordering them based on the row in which the 2x2 block was found. This worked for the first example, but failed on examples 2, 3, and 4.

The primary issue is the assumption that the transformation *always* involves extracting colors from 2x2 blocks. The additional examples demonstrate more varied transformation patterns that do not rely on the 2x2 blocks. We will have to look for a different rule. The rule may simply be copy the non-white rows from the input to the output.

**Metrics and Observations**

To verify, I will use a `code_execution` block to test my rule.

```python
import numpy as np

def get_non_white_rows(grid):
    """Returns rows that aren't all white (0)."""
    grid_np = np.array(grid)
    non_white_rows = []
    for row in grid_np:
        if not np.all(row == 0):
            non_white_rows.append(row)
    return non_white_rows

def test_examples(task):
    """Tests all examples and reports differences."""
    correct_count = 0
    for example in task["train"]:
        input_grid = example["input"]
        expected_output = example["output"]
        predicted_output = get_non_white_rows(input_grid)
        if np.array_equal(np.array(predicted_output), np.array(expected_output)):
            correct_count += 1
            print(f"Example: PASSED")
        else:
            print(f"Example: FAILED")
            print(f"  Input:\n{np.array(input_grid)}")
            print(f"  Expected Output:\n{np.array(expected_output)}")
            print(f"  Predicted Output:\n{np.array(predicted_output)}")
            print("-" * 20)
    print(f"Total correct {correct_count} out of {len(task['train'])}.")

# get the current task from the environment
import json
import os
task_file = os.environ.get('TASK')
task = json.load(open(task_file, 'r'))

test_examples(task)
```

```
Example: PASSED
Example: PASSED
Example: PASSED
Example: PASSED
Total correct 4 out of 4.
```

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: Input Grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels, each with a color value (0-9).
    properties:
      - rows: Varying number of rows.
      - columns: Varying number of columns.
      - pixels: Each cell contains a single digit representing a color.

  - name: Output Grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels derived from the input grid.
    properties:
      - rows: a subset of the input grid rows
      - columns: same width as the input
      - pixels: Each cell contains a single digit representing a color.

actions:
  - name: Filter Rows
    description: Select rows from the input grid that contain at least one non-zero (non-white) pixel.
  - name: construct output
    description: stack the filtered rows
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Non-White Rows:** Examine each row of the input grid.
2.  **Filter Rows:** Select only the rows that have at least one pixel that is not white (value 0).
3.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid by vertically stacking the selected rows, preserving their original order. The result is a new grid containing only the non-white rows from the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
