The output is a much smaller, vertical grid containing a seemingly ordered set of numbers. The output seems to pick specific, non-zero colors from the input, and seems to ignore others (like `8`). The background '0' pixels are also not represented. The colors chosen match unique colors found in the top row of solid colored regions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
