The output appears to be a 1D list of single digits, also representing colors, extracted from the input grid. The input grid contains multiple 3x2 subgrids of non-zero pixels. The background is always 0 (white). The subgrids can contain identical colors, such as the blue subgrids, or can have different colors. The output appears to consist of single color values that were part of 3x2 subgrids of non-zero pixels, where each subgrid contains a 1x2 region of the same color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
