objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 13
      columns: 10
      cells: pixels (integers 0-9)
  - type: block
    properties:
      color: varies (1, 2, 3, 8)
      shape: 2x2 rectangle
      location: varies
  - type: output_sequence
    properties:
      elements: integers
      length: 3

actions:
    - identify_blocks: Locate 2x2 regions of non-zero, uniform color.
    - extract_color: Determine the color value of each identified block.
    - order: vertically stack in ascending row number
    - build sequence: construct a sequence of colors from blocks.
    

relationships:
  - blocks_within_grid: The 2x2 blocks are contained within the larger grid.
  - color_to_output: each block color is a single value in the output
  - ordering: color values are presented vertically stacked.
