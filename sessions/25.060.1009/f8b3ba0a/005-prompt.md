Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Distinct Colored Regions:** Examine the input grid and identify all contiguous regions of non-zero pixels. Consider pixels to be part of the same region if they share a side (not just a corner).
2.  **Extract Specific Colors:** From the identified colored regions, find and take note of the color value of the topmost, leftmost pixel of any region with colors yellow (4), red (2) and green (3).
3. Order the Colors by row: Order the collected color values based on which rows they appear, starting at the top.
4.  **Create Output:** Construct a 3x1 output grid. Fill each cell of the output grid, top to bottom, with each color from the list, starting with the row with smallest number.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
