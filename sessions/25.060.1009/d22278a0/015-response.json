The input grid appears mostly blank (filled with '0' which represents white) with two single colored pixels: a '2' (red) in the top-left and a '4' (yellow) in the bottom-left. The output grid shows a checkerboard-like pattern emanating from these initial colored pixels, expanding both horizontally and vertically. The color white ('0') appears to serve as a background or \"empty\" space, allowing other colors to \"propagate\" or \"fill in\".  It seems the colors spread by alternating.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this example, they are the red (2) pixel at (0,0) and the yellow (4) pixel at (12,0).\n\n2.  **Red Propagation:** Starting from the initial red pixel, extend its color:\n    *   Horizontally to the right, filling every other cell with red.\n    *   Vertically downwards from each newly filled red pixel, filling every other cell with red.\n\n3.  **Yellow Propagation:** Starting from the initial yellow pixel, extend its color:\n    *   Horizontally to the right, filling every other cell with yellow.\n    * Vertically upwards from each new yellow cell, fill every other cell.\n\n4.  **Checkerboard Interaction:** The red and yellow propagations do not overwrite each other. Because they expand every *other* cell, this creates distinct rows and columns of color.\n\n5. The white pixels (0) remain unchanged where neither red nor yellow propagate.\n\nIn summary, the transformation creates expanding checkerboard patterns from the initial colored pixels, filling the grid based on alternating color propagation rules.\n"
