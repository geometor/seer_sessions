Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example pair and provide my observations, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of digits, representing colors. The input grid appears mostly blank (filled with '0' which represents white) with two single colored pixels: a '2' (red) in the top-left and a '4' (yellow) in the bottom-left. The output grid shows a checkerboard-like pattern emanating from these initial colored pixels, expanding both horizontally and vertically. The color white ('0') appears to serve as a background or "empty" space, allowing other colors to "propagate" or "fill in".  It seems the colors spread by alternating.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - red (2)
        - yellow (4)
      position: [row, column]
      state: changed/unchanged

actions:
  - name: propagate_color
    description: Extends a pixel's color to adjacent cells in a specific pattern.
    parameters:
      direction: horizontal and vertical
      alternating: true

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side (not diagonally).
  - type: initiation
    description: The initial red and yellow pixels serve as starting points for color propagation.
  - type: spatial_pattern
    description: Colors propagate, forming rows, columns, and a checkerboard interaction between regions.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Identify the non-white pixels in the input grid. These are the "seed" pixels. In this example, they are the red (2) pixel at (0,0) and the yellow (4) pixel at (12,0).

2.  **Red Propagation:** Starting from the initial red pixel, extend its color:
    *   Horizontally to the right, filling every other cell with red.
    *   Vertically downwards from each newly filled red pixel, filling every other cell with red.

3.  **Yellow Propagation:** Starting from the initial yellow pixel, extend its color:
    *   Horizontally to the right, filling every other cell with yellow.
    * Vertically upwards from each new yellow cell, fill every other cell.

4.  **Checkerboard Interaction:** The red and yellow propagations do not overwrite each other. Because they expand every *other* cell, this creates distinct rows and columns of color.

5. The white pixels (0) remain unchanged where neither red nor yellow propagate.

In summary, the transformation creates expanding checkerboard patterns from the initial colored pixels, filling the grid based on alternating color propagation rules.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
