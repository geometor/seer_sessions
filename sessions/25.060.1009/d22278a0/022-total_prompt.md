Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid-based transformation where colored pixels (represented by numbers) change their positions and potentially their colors or quantities. The primary colors involved are blue (1), red (2), and azure (8), with white (0) seemingly representing empty space. The input grid contains isolated blue, red, and azure pixels, while the output grid shows patterns of these colors. There appears to be a concept of "expansion" or "filling" related to the original pixels. The original colored pixels serve as "seed" points for growing areas with the same color, stopping when they encounter each other, or existing borders of the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [blue, red, azure, white]
      value: [1, 2, 8, 0]
      position: [row, column]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [7x7]
      cells: list of pixels

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: >
      Pixels of a specific color grow outwards from their initial position.
    parameters:
      color: color of the pixel to expand
      stop_condition: [ encountering another color or grid boundary ]

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: >
       Adjacent pixels interact during the expansion process, preventing
       further growth in that direction.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify seed pixels:** Locate the positions of all non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid. These are the "seed" pixels.
2.  **Iterate through seed pixels:** For each seed pixel:
3.  **Controlled Flood Fill**: The colored pixels grow around their original locations. If we imagine directions of North, South, East, and West.
    *   The blue pixel at \[0,0] fills one cell to the East, and two cells down.
    *   The blue pixel at \[6,0] fills one cell to the East, one cell to the North, and one cell diagonally to the north-east.
    *   The red pixel at \[0,6] fills one cell to the West, two cells down.
    *  Azure 8 "expands" or "grows" from the bottom left up and diagonal to the middle of the grid, constrained by other seed fills.

The above is my best assessment based just on the given information.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
