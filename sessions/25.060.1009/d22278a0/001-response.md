Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output examples to understand the underlying transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve replicating and alternating the non-zero digits in the input grid, creating a checkerboard-like pattern in the output, overlaid with solid colored regions based on where original digits were.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: variable
      - width: variable
      - cells: integers (0-9)

  - name: non_zero_digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 1-9
      - row_index: integer
      - col_index: integer

actions:
  - name: replicate_and_alternate
    description: Creates a checkerboard pattern based on the position of non-zero digits.
  - name: create_solid_region
    description: Fills a region with the non-zero digit based on it's original input location

relationships:
  - non-zero digits in the input grid determine the pattern and colors in the output grid.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Digits:** Locate all cells in the input grid containing non-zero digits. Note their values and original (row, column) positions.

2.  **Checkerboard Pattern:** For each non-zero digit:
    *   Starting from the digit's original row, alternate filling cells with the digit and 0 in that row.
    *   In the next row, shift the starting point (offset by one column) and repeat the alternating fill, creating a checkerboard.
    *   Continue this process, shifting the starting offset by one column with each successive row, effectively extending and alternating the digit's presence throughout the grid.

3. **Create Filled Regions** From the original location of each digit in the input grid, create solid rectangular blocks of that color in the output. The blocks extend downwards and to the right.
    * The start point and direction depends on the relationship between adjacent digits.

4.  **Blank Areas**: All the other elements are filled with zeroes.

In summary it appears that the core transformation consists of two combined elements: the first element replicates each non-zero digit into a horizontal checkerboard pattern, the second creates filled, colored blocks downwards and right from where each of the original input digits.
