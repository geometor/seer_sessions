However, it seems the fill should stop at specific columns (column 4 for blue and column 9(inclusive) for red). The code currently has bugs in the even/odd column detection for alternating fill and the boundary checks. The updated natural language description will address the correct start point, direction of the fill, stopping points, and alternation rules.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\n\nTo accurately analyze the results, I will use `code_execution` to calculate a diff between actual output and expected output for each example. This will highlight the exact discrepancies.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_diff(output_grid, expected_grid):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the difference between two grids.\"\"\"\n    return np.array(output_grid, dtype=int) - np.array(expected_grid, dtype=int)\ndef print_grid(grid, title):\n    print(title)\n    for row in grid:\n        print(row)\n\nexample_diffs = []\n\n# get the train data inputs and outputs\ntrain_in, train_out = task.train\n\nfor index, (input_grid, expected_grid) in enumerate(zip(train_in, train_out)):\n    output_grid = transform(input_grid['grid'])\n    diff = calculate_diff(output_grid, expected_grid['grid'])\n    print_grid(input_grid['grid'], title=f'input {index}')\n    print_grid(output_grid, title=f'output {index}')\n    print_grid(diff, title=f'diff {index}')    \n    example_diffs.append(diff)\n\n\n```"
