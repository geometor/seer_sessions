            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on a \"controlled flood fill\" concept, where non-white pixels in the input expand outwards. The code attempted to implement specific expansion rules for blue (1), red (2), and azure (8) pixels.  The tests show that while this concept has some merit, the initial implementation is incomplete and makes incorrect assumptions about how the expansion works, especially the extent and direction.\n\nThe primary strategy for improvement is to:\n\n1.  **Refine Expansion Rules:** Carefully examine each example to determine the precise expansion logic for each color. Pay close attention to the stopping conditions (boundaries and other colors). Look for diagonals.\n2.  **Consider Interactions:**  Determine if there are any interactions *between* the expanding colors. For example, does one color take precedence over another when they meet?\n3.  **Simplify and Generalize (if possible):**  While the initial code had separate rules for each color, look for opportunities to create a more general expansion rule, rather than hardcoding for each color.  This may not be possible, but should be considered.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo help understand this, I will use code execution, which involves a bit of manual work and data analysis.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the results of the existing code using the first three examples (I will focus on errors)\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_seed_pixels(grid):\n    # Find the coordinates of all non-white pixels.\n    seed_pixels = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0:\n                seed_pixels.append((r, c, grid[r, c]))\n    return seed_pixels\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions and filled with white (0).\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Get the seed pixels and their colors.\n    seed_pixels = get_seed_pixels(input_grid)\n\n    # Controlled flood fill for each seed pixel.\n    for r, c, color in seed_pixels:\n        output_grid[r, c] = color # original location\n        if color == 1:  # Top-left blue (1)\n            if c + 1 < cols:\n              output_grid[r,c+1] = color\n            if r + 1 < rows:\n              output_grid[r+1,c] = color\n            if r + 2 < rows:\n              output_grid[r+2,c] = color\n            if r + 1 < rows and c+1 < cols:\n                output_grid[r+1,c+1] = color\n\n\n        elif color == 2:  # Top-right red (2)\n            if c -

Needs more data.  Current tests DO NOT show any obvious priority of colors.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Find all non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid. These are the \"seed\" pixels.\n2.  **Expand Seeds:** Each seed pixel expands its color outward based on these rules:\n    *   **Blue (1):** Expands one step to the right, and down, and diagonally down/right until it hits a boundary or another color.\n    *   **Red (2):** Expands one step to the left, and down, and diagonally down/left, until it hits a boundary or another color.\n    *   **Azure (8):** Expands one step up, right, and diagonally up-right. Expansion stops when encountering another color or grid boundary. The azure pixel also fills the empty spaces directly up and right of itself, and diagonally up/right until a boundary or other color.\n3. **Stopping Condition:** Expansion of all colors ceases upon reaching any grid boundary or encountering a pixel of a different color.\n4. **Output:** Generate the output grid after expansion is completed for all seed pixels\n\nThe key update here is how the azure, blue, and red pixels fill the board. Also\nimportant is the description of when colors stop expanding.\n"
