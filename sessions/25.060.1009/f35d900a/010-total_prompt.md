Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits, representing colors.
*   The input grid mostly consists of '0' (white) pixels, with a few '1' (blue) and '8' (azure) pixels.
*    The input grid shows two distinct "objects", defined by contiguous color blocks of '1' and '8', mirrored across the horizontal center line.
*   The output grid introduces '5' (gray) pixels in positions that seem related to the positions and distances of the initial colored pixels.
*   Pixels 1 and 8 are mirrored and swapped in the other grid. And the area in between them is covered by color 5.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - objects:
      - id: object_1
        color: 1  # Blue
        initial_positions: [[3, 2], [14, 10]]
        shape: single pixel
      - id: object_2
        color: 8  # Azure
        initial_positions: [[3, 10], [14, 2]]
        shape: single pixel

  - actions:
      - type: mirror
        description: Each object of the same color has mirrored positions with respect to the horizontal center line.
      - type: swap
        description: The objects with color 1 and 8 exchange positions with the mirrored object.
      - type: fill
        description:  A new object is placed, filling positions between two swapped pixels with the same x coordinate with color gray.
  - relationships:
       - type: distance
         description:  The gray filling depends on the distance between swapped pixels.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels in the input grid. In this example, there will be single-pixel objects of color 1 (blue) and color 8 (azure).

2.  **Mirror and Swap:** Find the horizontal center line. Identify the mirror position for each object on opposite side of this center line, objects with color 1 and 8 exchange their mirrored positions with each other.

3.  **Fill:**
    * For each swapped pair of non-zero pixel on the vertical center line, fill color gray (5) to original position of the opposite side.
    * If original non-zero object is near the center line, add color 5 nearby.

4. Apply mirror transformation for 1 and 8 on another side.

5. Apply swap between mirrored objects for positions of 1 and 8.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
