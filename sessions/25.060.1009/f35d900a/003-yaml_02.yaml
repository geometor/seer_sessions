    description: output grid
    properties:
      - derived from the input grid

  - type: object
    description: red pixel (2) in input
    actions:
      - creates a 3x3 red square in the output, centered on self, and mirrored
        to other red pixels
  - type: object
    description: green pixel (3) in input
    actions:
      - creates a 3x3 green square in the output, centered on self, and mirrored
        to other green pixels
  - type: interaction
    description: red and green squares overlapping
    result:
      - creates gray (5) pixels where the red and green overlap
