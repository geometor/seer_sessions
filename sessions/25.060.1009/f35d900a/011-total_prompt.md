"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels in the input grid. In this example, there will be single-pixel objects of color 1 (blue) and color 8 (azure).

2.  **Mirror and Swap:** Find the horizontal center line. Identify the mirror position for each object on opposite side of this center line, objects with color 1 and 8 exchange their mirrored positions with each other.

3.  **Fill:**
    * For each swapped pair of non-zero pixel on the vertical center line, fill color gray (5) to original position of the opposite side.
    * If original non-zero object is near the center line, add color 5 nearby.

4. Apply mirror transformation for 1 and 8 on another side.

5. Apply swap between mirrored objects for positions of 1 and 8.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
