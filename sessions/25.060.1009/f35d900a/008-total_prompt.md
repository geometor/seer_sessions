3.  **Handle Overlap:** Examine every cell in the output grid. If any cell is within *both* a red 3x3 square and a green 3x3 square, change its value to 5 (gray). It does *not* matter if the cell is currently 0, 2 or 3. If it's within overlapping squares, it becomes 5.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, correctly handling the creation of 3x3 squares around red and green pixels and the overlapping gray regions. However, it's clear from the example set results that the initial code has a critical flaw: it only works if the input and output grid sizes are the same. The provided examples reveal that the output grid can have different dimensions than the input grid. The core logic of identifying red/green pixels, creating squares, and handling overlap is still valid, but we need to dynamically determine the output grid size.

The strategy to resolve this will involve these steps:

1.  **Analyze Input/Output Dimensions:** Examine all training examples to find a relationship between the input and output grid dimensions.
2.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Revise the program to include a step for calculating the output grid size based on the observed relationship.
3.  **Update Metrics and Facts:** Update the facts YAML and code execution metrics to reflect the dimension changes and any newly observed object properties or relationships.

**Code Execution for Metrics**

I'll use `print()` statements within the `transform` function to gather metrics about the input and output grid sizes and pixel locations. I will temporarily modify the provided code to include these print statements, execute it, and then provide the captured output. I'll do this for each training example.

        for j in range(max(0, center_col - 1), min(width, center_col + 2)):
            coords.append((i, j))
    return coords

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the specified rules."""
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    print(f"Input grid size: {height}x{width}")

Output grid size (before resizing): (9, 9)
example: 1
Expected output grid size: (13, 13)
Input grid size: 11x11
Red pixels: [(3, 3), (7, 7)]
Green pixels: [(3, 7), (7, 3)]
Output grid size (before resizing): (11, 11)
example: 2

Input grid size: 7x7
Red pixels: [(2, 2), (4, 4)]
Green pixels: [(2, 4), (4, 2)]
Output grid size (before resizing): (7, 7)
```

**Metrics Analysis**

From the code execution, we have the following critical observations:

*   **Input vs. Output Size:** The output grid is consistently larger than the input grid. The difference in dimensions appears to be consistent: output\_dimension = input\_dimension + 2.
*    Red and green pixels are always present
*   **Pixel Locations:**  The relative positions of the red and green pixels seem to determine the structure of the output.  The +2 dimension increase allows for a full 3x3 square to be created around *every* red and green pixel, even those near the edges of the *input* grid.

**YAML Facts**

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** Calculate the dimensions of the output grid. The output grid's height and width are each 2 units larger than the corresponding dimensions of the input grid.
2.  **Identify Red and Green Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are red (value 2) or green (value 3).
3.  **Create Squares:** For each red and green pixel:
    *   Create a 3x3 square in the output grid with the same color as the original pixel.
    *   Center the 3x3 square on the location of the original pixel, using the *input* grid's coordinates.
4.  **Handle Overlap:** Examine every cell in the output grid. If any cell is within *both* a red 3x3 square and a green 3x3 square, change its value to 5 (gray).
5.  **Blank Cells:** Any cells in the output grid that weren't filled by the above steps remain 0 (white/blank).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
