Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good start, focusing on mirroring and swapping blue (1) and azure (8) pixels. However, the test results reveal some inaccuracies, particularly in how the gray (5) filling is applied. The existing logic seems to over-apply the gray filling, extending it beyond the intended areas, especially around the mirrored objects and also not all cases are correctly handled.

The core idea of mirroring and swapping colors 1 and 8 remains valid. The primary area for improvement is refining the gray (5) filling logic. We need to more precisely define the conditions under which gray is filled.

**Code Execution for Metrics and Observations**

I don't have direct code execution capabilities, so I will provide a set of observations, if I had code execution capabilities i'd report specific details of each run

Here's a breakdown of what I *would* observe if I could execute the code on each example:

*   **Example 1:**  The initial example, on which transformation rule was designed.  The output should match.
*   **Example 2:** The generated output largely differs from expected output, the transform function swapped color 1 and color 8, and added color 5. However, expected output seems only mirrored object with color 8 and kept object with color 1 in its position. Also, expected output did not add any color 5.
*   **Example 3:** Generated output is different from expected output. Transform function perform swap and put color 5. However, expected output perform only mirroring without putting color 5.

**YAML Fact Representation**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    observations: |
      Input has blue (1) and azure (8) pixels.
      Output shows a mirrored swap of blue and azure, with gray (5) filling between the original and mirrored positions of swapped pixels.
      Gray (5) also appears on the center line if original blue and azure appears.
    discrepancies: None
  - example_id: 2
    observations: |
        Input has blue(1) and azure(8) pixels and non-symmetrical number of objects.
        Expected output has only azure pixels in mirrored position and has blue pixels at its positions.
        Transform function wrongly performes swap. Also, it added color 5, which is not present in expected output.
    discrepancies: Significant. Gray filling logic incorrect. Swapping rule incorrect.
  - example_id: 3
    observations: |
        Input has blue(1) and azure(8) pixels and non-symmetrical number of objects.
        Expected output has blue and azure pixels in mirrored positions.
        Transform function correctly mirrors, but does not handle gray filling correctly. Also, it swapped colors.
    discrepancies: Significant. Gray filling and swapping logic incorrect.

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all individual pixels of color blue (1) and azure (8) in the input grid.

2.  **Mirror:** For *every* blue (1) and azure (8) pixel, determine its mirrored position across the horizontal center line of the grid.

3. **Conditional Swap and Keep**:
   * If a blue(1) pixel is mirrored by azure(8), perform a swap operation: The blue pixel in the original position will be azure in the mirrored position, and the azure pixel in original position will become blue in the mirrored position.
   * If a blue(1) pixel is mirrored by another blue(1) pixel, they remain blue in their mirrored positions.
   * If an azure(8) pixel is mirrored by another azure(8) pixel, they remain azure in their mirrored positions.

4.  **Conditional Gray Filling:**
  * Gray(5) is added *only* on the center line for rows that have *both* color 1 and color 8 in original input.
  * No other gray color filling occurs.

5. **Apply Mirror Transformation**: Transform blue and azure objects into the mirror position.

6. **Apply Conditional Color Change:** Swap colors of the objects in mirror position based on condition on step 3.
