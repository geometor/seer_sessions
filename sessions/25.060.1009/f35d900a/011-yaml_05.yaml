examples:
  - example_id: 1
    observations: |
      Input has blue (1) and azure (8) pixels.
      Output shows a mirrored swap of blue and azure, with gray (5) filling between the original and mirrored positions of swapped pixels.
      Gray (5) also appears on the center line if original blue and azure appears.
    discrepancies: None
  - example_id: 2
    observations: |
        Input has blue(1) and azure(8) pixels and non-symmetrical number of objects.
        Expected output has only azure pixels in mirrored position and has blue pixels at its positions.
        Transform function wrongly performes swap. Also, it added color 5, which is not present in expected output.
    discrepancies: Significant. Gray filling logic incorrect. Swapping rule incorrect.

        Expected output has blue and azure pixels in mirrored positions.

    discrepancies: Significant. Gray filling and swapping logic incorrect.
