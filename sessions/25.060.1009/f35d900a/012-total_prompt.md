"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels in the input grid. In this example, there will be single-pixel objects of color 1 (blue) and color 8 (azure).

2.  **Mirror and Swap:** Find the horizontal center line. Identify the mirror position for each object on opposite side of this center line, objects with color 1 and 8 exchange their mirrored positions with each other.

3.  **Fill:**
    * For each swapped pair of non-zero pixel on the vertical center line, fill color gray (5) to original position of the opposite side.
    * If original non-zero object is near the center line, add color 5 nearby.

4. Apply mirror transformation for 1 and 8 on another side.

5. Apply swap between mirrored objects for positions of 1 and 8.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good start, focusing on mirroring and swapping blue (1) and azure (8) pixels. However, the test results reveal some inaccuracies, particularly in how the gray (5) filling is applied. The existing logic seems to over-apply the gray filling, extending it beyond the intended areas, especially around the mirrored objects and also not all cases are correctly handled.

The core idea of mirroring and swapping colors 1 and 8 remains valid. The primary area for improvement is refining the gray (5) filling logic. We need to more precisely define the conditions under which gray is filled.

**Code Execution for Metrics and Observations**

I don't have direct code execution capabilities, so I will provide a set of observations, if I had code execution capabilities i'd report specific details of each run

Here's a breakdown of what I *would* observe if I could execute the code on each example:

*   **Example 1:**  The initial example, on which transformation rule was designed.  The output should match.
*   **Example 2:** The generated output largely differs from expected output, the transform function swapped color 1 and color 8, and added color 5. However, expected output seems only mirrored object with color 8 and kept object with color 1 in its position. Also, expected output did not add any color 5.
*   **Example 3:** Generated output is different from expected output. Transform function perform swap and put color 5. However, expected output perform only mirroring without putting color 5.

**YAML Fact Representation**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    observations: |
      Input has blue (1) and azure (8) pixels.
      Output shows a mirrored swap of blue and azure, with gray (5) filling between the original and mirrored positions of swapped pixels.
      Gray (5) also appears on the center line if original blue and azure appears.
    discrepancies: None
  - example_id: 2
    observations: |
        Input has blue(1) and azure(8) pixels and non-symmetrical number of objects.
        Expected output has only azure pixels in mirrored position and has blue pixels at its positions.
        Transform function wrongly performes swap. Also, it added color 5, which is not present in expected output.
    discrepancies: Significant. Gray filling logic incorrect. Swapping rule incorrect.
  - example_id: 3
    observations: |
        Input has blue(1) and azure(8) pixels and non-symmetrical number of objects.
        Expected output has blue and azure pixels in mirrored positions.
        Transform function correctly mirrors, but does not handle gray filling correctly. Also, it swapped colors.
    discrepancies: Significant. Gray filling and swapping logic incorrect.

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all individual pixels of color blue (1) and azure (8) in the input grid.

2.  **Mirror:** For *every* blue (1) and azure (8) pixel, determine its mirrored position across the horizontal center line of the grid.

3. **Conditional Swap and Keep**:
   * If a blue(1) pixel is mirrored by azure(8), perform a swap operation: The blue pixel in the original position will be azure in the mirrored position, and the azure pixel in original position will become blue in the mirrored position.
   * If a blue(1) pixel is mirrored by another blue(1) pixel, they remain blue in their mirrored positions.
   * If an azure(8) pixel is mirrored by another azure(8) pixel, they remain azure in their mirrored positions.

4.  **Conditional Gray Filling:**
  * Gray(5) is added *only* on the center line for rows that have *both* color 1 and color 8 in original input.
  * No other gray color filling occurs.

5. **Apply Mirror Transformation**: Transform blue and azure objects into the mirror position.

6. **Apply Conditional Color Change:** Swap colors of the objects in mirror position based on condition on step 3.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
