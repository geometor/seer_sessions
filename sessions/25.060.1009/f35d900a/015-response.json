The input grid contains isolated red (2) and yellow (4) pixels, seemingly randomly placed on a background of white (0) pixels. The output grid introduces new gray (5) pixels and expands the red and yellow pixels into 3x1, 1x3 or 3x3 formations, with gray pixels appearing at their intersection. The relative positions of the original red and yellow pixels are maintained. The shape of the expanded colored regions are defined by their vertical and horizontal position.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
