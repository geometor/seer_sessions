The primary elements are colored \"objects\" formed by contiguous pixels of the same color. There's a consistent transformation between the input and output grids, suggesting a rule-based manipulation of these objects. The transformation seems to involve a combination of:\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** Identifying distinct colored objects in the input.\n2.  **Replication/Expansion:** Creating multiple copies or expanding the identified objects.\n3.  **Placement:** Positioning the replicated/expanded objects in a specific arrangement in the output grid.\n4.  **Background Insertion:** A grey (color 5) object seems to fill spaces between and around replicated color objects.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
