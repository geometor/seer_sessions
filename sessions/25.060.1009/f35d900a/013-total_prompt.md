Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all individual pixels of color blue (1) and azure (8) in the input grid.

2.  **Mirror:** For *every* blue (1) and azure (8) pixel, determine its mirrored position across the horizontal center line of the grid.

3. **Conditional Swap and Keep**:
   * If a blue(1) pixel is mirrored by azure(8), perform a swap operation: The blue pixel in the original position will be azure in the mirrored position, and the azure pixel in original position will become blue in the mirrored position.
   * If a blue(1) pixel is mirrored by another blue(1) pixel, they remain blue in their mirrored positions.
   * If an azure(8) pixel is mirrored by another azure(8) pixel, they remain azure in their mirrored positions.

4.  **Conditional Gray Filling:**
  * Gray(5) is added *only* on the center line for rows that have *both* color 1 and color 8 in original input.
  * No other gray color filling occurs.

5. **Apply Mirror Transformation**: Transform blue and azure objects into the mirror position.

6. **Apply Conditional Color Change:** Swap colors of the objects in mirror position based on condition on step 3.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
