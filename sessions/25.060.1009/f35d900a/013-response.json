            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code were a good start, focusing on mirroring and conditional swapping of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels. However, the gray (5) filling rule was not completely accurate, and the conditional swapping needs some adjustments based on all of the provided examples. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to the placement of blue, azure, and gray pixels.\n2.  **Refine Gray Filling Rule:** The initial rule for gray filling was too broad. Determine the precise condition for when gray is applied. It isn't simply about presence of 1 and 8 in a row but it is about the horizontal center line.\n3.  **Refine Swap/Keep Logic:** Re-evaluate when colors swap versus when they remain the same during mirroring, consider all combinations.\n4.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Describe the updated logic clearly and concisely.\n5. **Update YAML and Metrics**: Update factual description\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution)**\n\nTo verify my understanding of the examples, I use a simple reporting.\n\n```python\ndef report(grid, label):\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    print(f\"--- {label} ---\")\n    print(f\"Dimensions: {rows}x{cols}\")\n    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)\n    color_counts = dict(zip(unique, counts))\n    print(f\"Color Counts: {color_counts}\")\n    # check for horizontal symmetry\n    if rows%2 != 0: # only if odd height\n      center = rows//2\n      for i in range(center):\n        if not np.array_equal(grid[i], grid[-(i+1)]):\n          print(f\"Row {i} is not symmetrical with Row {-(i+1)}\")\n        else:\n          print(f\"Row {i} is symmetrical with Row {-(i+1)}\")\n\n#Example Usage:\n#report(input_grid, \"Input\")\n#report(output_grid, \"Output\")\n\n# Demonstrate examples of code execution.

Gray only appears on the center line of *odd-height* grids, and *only* when *both* blue and azure are present in the input (anywhere, not necessarily in the center row).\n- **Swap Logic:** clarified to be more complete.\n-   **Horizontal Mirror:** This condition applies to all objects and properties.\n"
