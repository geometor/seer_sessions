Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all individual pixels of color blue (1) and azure (8) in the input grid.

2.  **Mirror:** For *every* blue (1) and azure (8) pixel, determine its mirrored position across the horizontal center line of the grid.

3. **Conditional Swap and Keep**:
   * If a blue(1) pixel is mirrored by azure(8), perform a swap operation: The blue pixel in the original position will be azure in the mirrored position, and the azure pixel in original position will become blue in the mirrored position.
   * If a blue(1) pixel is mirrored by another blue(1) pixel, they remain blue in their mirrored positions.
   * If an azure(8) pixel is mirrored by another azure(8) pixel, they remain azure in their mirrored positions.

4.  **Conditional Gray Filling:**
  * Gray(5) is added *only* on the center line for rows that have *both* color 1 and color 8 in original input.
  * No other gray color filling occurs.

5. **Apply Mirror Transformation**: Transform blue and azure objects into the mirror position.

6. **Apply Conditional Color Change:** Swap colors of the objects in mirror position based on condition on step 3.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were a good start, focusing on mirroring and conditional swapping of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels. However, the gray (5) filling rule was not completely accurate, and the conditional swapping needs some adjustments based on all of the provided examples. The strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to the placement of blue, azure, and gray pixels.
2.  **Refine Gray Filling Rule:** The initial rule for gray filling was too broad. Determine the precise condition for when gray is applied. It isn't simply about presence of 1 and 8 in a row but it is about the horizontal center line.
3.  **Refine Swap/Keep Logic:** Re-evaluate when colors swap versus when they remain the same during mirroring, consider all combinations.
4.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Describe the updated logic clearly and concisely.
5. **Update YAML and Metrics**: Update factual description

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution)**

To verify my understanding of the examples, I use a simple reporting.

```python
def report(grid, label):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    print(f"--- {label} ---")
    print(f"Dimensions: {rows}x{cols}")
    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
    color_counts = dict(zip(unique, counts))
    print(f"Color Counts: {color_counts}")
    # check for horizontal symmetry
    if rows%2 != 0: # only if odd height
      center = rows//2
      for i in range(center):
        if not np.array_equal(grid[i], grid[-(i+1)]):
          print(f"Row {i} is not symmetrical with Row {-(i+1)}")
        else:
          print(f"Row {i} is symmetrical with Row {-(i+1)}")

      - can_mirror: true
      - can_swap: true
    actions:

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Mirroring:** All blue (1) and azure (8) pixels are mirrored across the horizontal center line of the grid.

2.  **Conditional Swap:**
    *   If a blue (1) pixel is mirrored by an azure (8) pixel, their colors are swapped.
    *   If a blue (1) pixel mirrors another blue (1) pixel, their colors remain blue.
    *   If an azure (8) pixel mirrors another azure (8) pixel, their colors remain azure.

3. **Conditional Gray Filling:**
    * If input grid has an *odd* number of rows, the center row is filled with gray (5) *if and only if* both blue(1) and azure(8) exist anywhere in the original input grid.
    * if the input grid has an *even* number of rows, no gray filling occurs.
4. **Apply Mirror and Swap**: All transformations are applied.

**Key Changes and Justification**

-   **Gray Filling:** The gray filling rule is now more precise. Gray only appears on the center line of *odd-height* grids, and *only* when *both* blue and azure are present in the input (anywhere, not necessarily in the center row).
- **Swap Logic:** clarified to be more complete.
-   **Horizontal Mirror:** This condition applies to all objects and properties.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
