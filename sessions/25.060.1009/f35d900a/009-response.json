And the area in between them is covered by color 5.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

In this example, there will be single-pixel objects of color 1 (blue) and color 8 (azure).\n\n2.  **Mirror and Swap:** Find the horizontal center line. Identify the mirror position for each object on opposite side of this center line, objects with color 1 and 8 exchange their mirrored positions with each other.\n\n3.  **Fill:**\n    * For each swapped pair of non-zero pixel on the vertical center line, fill color gray (5) to original position of the opposite side.\n    * If original non-zero object is near the center line, add color 5 nearby.\n\n4.
