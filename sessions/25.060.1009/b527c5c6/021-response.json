Both grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors observed are green (3), white (0), and red (2). The input grid appears to have two distinct regions: a large green region at the top and a white/green region at the bottom. There are also isolated red (2) pixels. The output grid shows changes in the positions and extents of some of these features.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

It takes over the rows containing the red pixel on the top-left, keeping the original width of the green area and its leftmost coordinate.\n\n3. **Transformation of the Top Left Red Pixel:** the red pixel at the top, expands vertically along the entire height of the grid. Keeping the original x coordinate.\n\n4.  **Transformation of the Bottom Right Red Pixel:** The red pixel at row 13, changes into horizontal line of red pixels to the right. This starts from where the isolated red pixel was, and now occupies the whole width of the original object made by the green color.\n    The whole red line also moves up by one row, to start now at row 12.\n"
