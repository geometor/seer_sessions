Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Copy Grid:** Create a copy of the input grid as the output grid.
2.  **Preserve White:** White pixels in the input remain white in the output (this is implicit in the copy).
3.  **Single Red Pixel Rule:** If there's a *single* red pixel (not adjacent to other red pixels), change the three pixels directly above it to the pattern `3 2 3` (green, red, green), *if those three pixels exist*.
4.  **Green to Red Conversion:** Convert any green pixel to a red pixel if it has any neighboring red pixel.
5.  **Preserve Non-adjacent Green:** If a green is NOT adjacent to any red, it does not change.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
