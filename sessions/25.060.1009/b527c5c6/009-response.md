Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output grids are of the same dimensions (20x20).
*   The input grid contains two main colors: green (3) and white (0). There are also a few isolated red (2) pixels within the green areas.
*   The output grid seems to retain the overall shape of the green areas from the input.
*   The red pixels in the input seem to influence changes in the output, sometimes expanding or shifting.
* White areas remain white.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 20x20
      colors: [white, green, red]
  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: green
      description: A large connected region of green pixels.
      variations:
        - description: A horizontal line of green at the top.
        - description: A vertical line of green at the bottom.
        - description: These are connected.
  - type: isolated_pixel
    properties:
      color: red
      location: Inside the green shape.
      variations:
       - description: single red pixel
       - description: it appears red can be adjacent.

actions:
  - type: copy
    description: The overall shape of the green area is largely preserved.
  - type: modify_red
    description: The red pixels are altered, potentially expanding or shifting.
    details: The output suggests a relationship between the location of single red pixels and adjacent red pixels.

relationships:
  - input_output: The output grid is a transformation of the input grid, maintaining dimensions.
  - shape_pixel: Isolated red pixels are located within the green shape.
  - red_modification: The change in red pixels seems dependent on the surrounding pixels and adjacent red pixels.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy the Grid:** Start with a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Preserve White:** All white (0) pixels in the input remain white (0) in the output.
3.  **Preserve Green regions**: Maintain green (3) in output, except adjacent to red.
4.  **Modify Red:**
    *   If a red pixel is next to existing green, it and all adjacent pixels become red in output.
    *   If a single red pixel exists in the input, the three pixels above are converted to `3 2 3` respectively.
    *   If there are adjacent reds in a line, replace those with a solid red line.

In short, the overall shape of the larger green "object" is preserved. The modification involves the red pixels.
