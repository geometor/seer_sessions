Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the isolated red (2) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Vertical Expansion (Green):** The large green (3) region expands downwards. It takes over the rows containing the red pixel on the top-left, keeping the original width of the green area and its leftmost coordinate.

3. **Transformation of the Top Left Red Pixel:** the red pixel at the top, expands vertically along the entire height of the grid. Keeping the original x coordinate.

4.  **Transformation of the Bottom Right Red Pixel:** The red pixel at row 13, changes into horizontal line of red pixels to the right. This starts from where the isolated red pixel was, and now occupies the whole width of the original object made by the green color.
    The whole red line also moves up by one row, to start now at row 12.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the initial `transform` function to the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, focusing on the prominent features of the first training example. However, testing against all training examples reveals inconsistencies and incorrect transformations. The primary issues seem to be:

1.  **Overly Specific Rules:** The initial program was too specific to the first example, particularly regarding the behavior of the red pixels and the green region's expansion. It assumed a specific spatial relationship and interaction that doesn't hold universally.
2.  **Incorrect Vertical Expansion:** The vertical expansion of the green area is not consistent across all examples. Sometimes it fills the entire column, and other times it expands based on red pixels, but not as initially described.
3. **Incorrect Red Pixel Handling**: The handling of red pixels transformation has to be addressed correctly, as this part is creating most of the errors.

The strategy to address these errors is as follows:

1.  **Generalize:** Revisit the natural language program to make it less specific to the first example's configuration. Focus on general rules applicable to all examples.
2.  **Object Identification:** Improve object identification. Clearly distinguish between different instances of the same color (e.g., multiple green or red regions).
3. **Conditional Logic**: the first approach failed to consider enough conditional statements to cover the rules.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated code and natural language program after each significant change, iterating until all training examples are correctly transformed.

**Metrics and Observations**

To get precise metrics, I will describe the observations and any useful information I can find.

*Example 1:*

-   Input: Green object, two red pixels (one at top-left, another below).
-   Expected Output: Green expands, top-left red becomes a vertical line, bottom-right red becomes a partial horizontal line.
-   Actual Output: Matches the expected output.
- conclusion: Initial code works as expected.

*Example 2:*

-   Input: Larger, more complex green object, single red pixel within the green object's vertical span.
-   Expected Output: Green expands to fill the whole area, red pixel extends to the left.
-   Actual Output: Green object did partially what was intended, missing to color two lines at the bottom. Red pixel correctly expands to the left, but also expands vertically - which is not intened.
- conclusion: vertical expansion and red pixel handling are creating errors

*Example 3:*

-   Input: Very small green object; single red pixel, not related to the location of the green.
-   Expected Output: Green object changes and is placed at the location of the red pixel. The red pixel is transformed to a vertical line.
-   Actual Output: Green is filling the area which originally contained the red pixel. The red pixel is changed to the a vertical line.
- conclusion: The code is working as described by the natural language, but is failing to model the actual transformation rule.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
example_1:
  green_object:
    shape: irregular
    initial_position: top-left
    action: expand_down_to_red_top
  red_pixels:
    - position: top-left
      action: expand_vertically
    - position: bottom-right
      action: expand_horizontally_move_up

example_2:
  green_object:
    shape: complex
    initial_position: center
    action: fill_column
  red_pixel:
    - position: within_green_vertical
      action: extend_left

example_3:
  green_object:
     shape: small
     initial_position: center
     action: position_change
  red_pixel:
     - position: unrelated_to_green
       action: vertical_line
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all green and red pixels. Treat each contiguous block of the same color as a distinct object.
2.  **Green Object Transformation:**
    *   The green object changes location, or expands vertically based on its relative position to the red pixels.
    * The transformation changes according to the number and relative locations of the red pixels.
3.  **Red Pixel Transformation**:
    * If only one red pixel is present, it is transformed into a vertical line.
    * If more that one red pixel is present, the upper red pixel is transformed into a vertical line, and the bottom red pixel expands to the right until reaching the width of the expanded green object.

This revised program is more general and aims to capture the core transformations without being overly specific to any single example's geometry. The next step will be to implement the changes in the function.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
