Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing pixels of different colors (represented by integers 0-9). The primary colors observed are green (3), red (2), and white (0). The core transformation seems to involve manipulating the red pixels (2) relative to the green pixels (3). The shapes formed by the green pixels appear to be significant.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: green_shape
    type: shape
    color: green (3)
    description: Contiguous regions of green pixels. Can be various shapes (L-shape, T-shape, line, etc.)

  - id: red_pixel
    type: pixel
    color: red (2)
    description:  Single pixels, usually located within or adjacent to the green shapes.

  - id: background
    type: background
    color: white(0)
    description: pixels not part of defined shapes

actions:
  - name: extend_red
    description: Red pixels are extended or replicated along the green shape.
    constraints: The extension follows the contour/edges of the green shape and sometimes fill a green vertical object entirely.

relationships:
  - subject: red_pixel
    relation: is_part_of_or_adjacent_to
    object: green_shape
    
  - subject: green_shape
    relation: defines_extension_path
    object: red_pixel
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Shapes:** Locate all contiguous regions of green (3) pixels. These form the "green shapes."

2.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all red (2) pixels that either inside a green object or adjacent to the green shapes.

3.  **Extend Red Vertically:** For each identified red pixel, copy and extend the red color, but limited within the green shape, in the following way:
      * If the red pixel is inside the green object, then we copy the entire column of green to red
      * If the red pixel is outside the green object, then we copy the red color until a 2-pixel vertical segment of color 3 is encountered. If the current red color is in a column, we need to copy and extend the color horizontally, until a 2-pixel horizontal segment of color 3.

4. The background pixels remains the same.

This program captures the essence of the observed transformation: extending red pixels along the boundaries or completely within the interior of green shapes.
