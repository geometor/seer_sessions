Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all green and red pixels. Treat each contiguous block of the same color as a distinct object.
2.  **Green Object Transformation:**
    *   The green object changes location, or expands vertically based on its relative position to the red pixels.
    * The transformation changes according to the number and relative locations of the red pixels.
3.  **Red Pixel Transformation**:
    * If only one red pixel is present, it is transformed into a vertical line.
    * If more that one red pixel is present, the upper red pixel is transformed into a vertical line, and the bottom red pixel expands to the right until reaching the width of the expanded green object.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples. The initial natural language program and code were based on the first training example. Now we need to refine it based on how it performs on *all* training examples.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code does a decent job of identifying green and red objects and attempting transformations based on their relative positions. However, it clearly doesn't capture the full logic, as evidenced by the mismatches in the provided example outputs. The primary issues seem to be:

1.  **Inconsistent Green Object Handling:** The green object's transformation isn't always a simple move or expansion. It sometimes disappears, changes shape, or is dependent on complex interactions with red *lines* (not just single red pixels).
2.  **Red Object Misinterpretation:** The code assumes red objects are always single pixels initially. The examples show that red objects can already be lines, and the transformation rule depends on the *existing* form of the red object (line or point).
3.  **Missing Logic:** The code doesn't cover all possible scenarios.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Object Identification Refinement:**  Improve `find_objects` to accurately identify not just single-pixel objects, but also linear structures (horizontal or vertical lines). We need to distinguish between a single red pixel and a red line.
2.  **Conditional Logic:**  Introduce more conditional logic based on the *number and type* of red and green objects.  The transformation rules are clearly different depending on whether we have a single red pixel, a red line, a single green pixel, or a green block.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated code after each significant change to the natural language program and the code, using all training examples.

**Metrics and Observations (using Code Execution for Verification)**

I'll use Python code blocks to help analyze the grids and derive accurate metrics.  I'll start with the first pair:

    return np.array([list(map(int, row)) for row in grid_str.split('\n')])

  input_np = grid_to_np(input_grid)
  output_np = grid_to_np(output_grid)
  predicted_np = grid_to_np(predicted_grid)
  print(f"Input:\n{input_np}\n")
  print(f"Expected Output:\n{output_np}\n")
  print(f"Predicted Output:\n{predicted_np}\n")
  print(f"Equal: {np.array_equal(output_np, predicted_np)}\n")
  print(f"Input Green Count: {np.sum(input_np == 3)}")
  print(f"Input Red Count: {np.sum(input_np == 2)}")
  print(f"Output Green Count: {np.sum(output_np == 3)}")
  print(f"Output Red Count: {np.sum(output_np == 2)}")

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Object Identification:** Identify contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color as distinct objects. Classify objects as "single pixel" or "line" (horizontal or vertical).
2.  **Transformation Rules (Conditional):**

    *   **If there is one red pixel and one green pixel:** The red pixel becomes a vertical line occupying its original column. The green pixel moves to the row above where the original red pixel.

    *   **If there is one red pixel and NO green pixel**: The red pixel becomes a vertical line occupying its original column.

    *   **If there's a red horizontal line and a green pixel:** The red line remains unchanged, and the green pixel disappears.
    * **If there's any other combination:** Further examples needed.

3. **Priority**: Red transformations appear to take precedence.

The next step would be to adjust the python code.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
