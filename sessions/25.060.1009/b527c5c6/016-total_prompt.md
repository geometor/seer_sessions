Okay, let's analyze this input-output example to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (20x20).
*   The grids primarily contain 0 (white), with some areas of 3 (green) and 2 (red).
*   The green areas seem to be the primary "objects" being manipulated.
*    A single red pixel in the green shape is present in the input
*   The position of the single red pixel looks significant.

**YAML Fact Identification:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: green_region_1
    type: connected_region
    color: 3
    initial_position: top_left
    shape: irregular
    contains: [red_pixel_1]

  - object: green_region_2
    type: connected_region
    color: 3
    initial_position: bottom_right
    shape: irregular
     contains: [red_pixel_2]

  - object: red_pixel_1
      type: single_pixel
      color: 2
      initial_row: 3
      initial_col: 5
      relative_position: within green_region_1

  - object: red_pixel_2
      type: single_pixel
      color: 2
      initial_row: 14
      initial_col: 10
      relative_position: within green_region_2

  - action: move_red_pixel
    type: translation
    target: red_pixels
    constrained_by: green region shape

  - transformation: green_region_border
      description: green pixels at the boundary with white pixels may change
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of green (3) pixels.
2.  **Identify Red Pixels Within Regions:** Within each green region, identify any red (2) pixels.
3. **Red Pixel as an anchor:** The top three rows appear to be based on a border created based on the red pixel location.
4. **Reposition Green Regions:**
      The main body of the upper green object is unchanged.
      The main body of the lower green object appears to expand up, and it consumes/overlays the red pixel, coloring an area above equal to it's width. The height is determined by the position of the other red pixel.
5. **Paint Red:** Create a red horizontal bar in the location of the moved lower red pixel.

The program takes an input grid, identifies green regions and any red pixels inside the regions, and repositions the red regions in the rows based on the initial position of the red pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
