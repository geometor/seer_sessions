The primary colors observed are green (3), red (2), and white (0). The core transformation seems to involve manipulating the red pixels (2) relative to the green pixels (3). The shapes formed by the green pixels appear to be significant.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

If the current red color is in a column, we need to copy and extend the color horizontally, until a 2-pixel horizontal segment of color 3.\n\n4. The background pixels remains the same.\n\nThis program captures the essence of the observed transformation: extending red pixels along the boundaries or completely within the interior of green shapes.\n"
