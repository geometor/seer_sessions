objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 20x20
      colors: [white, green, red]
  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: green
      description: A large connected region of green pixels.
      variations:
        - description: A horizontal line of green at the top.
        - description: A vertical line of green at the bottom.
        - description: These are connected.
  - type: isolated_pixel
    properties:
      color: red
      location: Inside the green shape.
      variations:
       - description: single red pixel
       - description: it appears red can be adjacent.

actions:
  - type: copy
    description: The overall shape of the green area is largely preserved.
  - type: modify_red
    description: The red pixels are altered, potentially expanding or shifting.
    details: The output suggests a relationship between the location of single red pixels and adjacent red pixels.

relationships:
  - input_output: The output grid is a transformation of the input grid, maintaining dimensions.
  - shape_pixel: Isolated red pixels are located within the green shape.
  - red_modification: The change in red pixels seems dependent on the surrounding pixels and adjacent red pixels.
