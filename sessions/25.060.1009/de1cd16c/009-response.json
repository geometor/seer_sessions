It appears to be divided into four quadrants, each dominated by a single color (green, red, and two azure quadrants). There are also a few blue pixels scattered within the larger colored regions. The output is a single digit, '2'. This suggests the transformation might involve counting something within the input grid. Given the prominence of the colors, it's very likely related to the number, position, or arrangement of colored regions or pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
