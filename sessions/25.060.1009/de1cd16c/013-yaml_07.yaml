facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid consistently retains colored pixels other than black (0) that are present in the input grid.
  - observation: |

  - observation: |
    The non-black pixels are positioned at a consistent relative location from input to output.
  - rule: Output dimensions are always smaller than input dimensions.
  - rule: The output grid only contains colors that were also in the input grid.
