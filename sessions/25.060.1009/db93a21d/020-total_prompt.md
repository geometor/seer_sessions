This program performs the following transformation:
1. Identifies all maroon (9) rectangles in the input grid.
2. Outlines each maroon rectangle with a green (3) border, one pixel thick.
3. Adds a new blue (1) rectangle (4x7) in an empty region.
4. Outlines the new blue rectangle with a green (3) border, one pixel thick.
5. Fills white (0) background pixels adjacent to the green outlines with green (3).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example and, as expected, doesn't perfectly generalize to all cases. The core logic of identifying rectangles, outlining them, adding a new rectangle, and filling adjacent pixels seems sound, but the specifics (like the placement and size of the added rectangle, and perhaps conditions for outlining) need adjustment.

My strategy is as follows:

1. **Analyze each example pair:** Carefully examine each input/output pair and the result of the `transform` function. Note discrepancies between the expected output and the actual output.
2. **Identify consistent patterns:** Look for patterns that hold across *all* examples. For example, is the added rectangle always blue? Is its size always the same?  Is the outline color always green? Is the fill always green?
3. **Refine the natural language program:** Based on the consistent patterns, update the natural language program to be more accurate and general.
4. **Prioritize object finding:** it is important that the object identification is accurate and reliable, so focus on how to improve that.

**Metrics and Observations**

I'll use a structured approach to analyze each example pair. I'll focus on:

*   **Maroon Rectangles:** Number, size, and position in both input and output.
*   **Added Blue Rectangle:** Presence, size, position, and outline.
*   **Green Outline:** Presence and correctness.
*   **Green Fill:** Presence and correctness.
*   **Discrepancies:** Specific pixels that differ between the expected output and the generated output.

Here's a breakdown of each example pair and observations from the code execution:

```python

    """Provides a basic description of the grid."""
    return f"Grid size: {grid.shape}, Colors: {np.unique(grid)}"

    diff = grid1 != grid2
    if np.any(diff):
        diff_coords = np.argwhere(diff)
        diff_desc = "; ".join([f"({x},{y}): {grid1[x,y]} != {grid2[x,y]}" for x, y in diff_coords])

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
task_id: 6f816664
description: >
  The task involves identifying maroon rectangles, outlining them with green,
  adding a blue rectangle, outlining the blue rectangle in green,
  and filling white background adjacent to green with green.  The location of the
  blue rectangle changes in relation to the maroon rectangle.
objects:
  - color: 9  # Maroon
    type: rectangle
    action: outline
    outline_color: 3  # Green
  - color: 1  # Blue
    type: rectangle
    size: (4x7) # based on finding consistent size across all examples, not just (2,1),(8,4)
    action: add
    outline_color: 3 # Green
  - color: 3  # Green
    type: outline
    action: fill_adjacent
    fill_target: 0  # White
observations:
  - The blue rectangle is added at the top of the input grid.
  - The maroon rectangles are outlined.
  - White pixels adjacent to green pixels become green.
  - example 2: generated outline around blue rectangle is incorrect
  - example 2: location of the blue rectangle is incorrect
  - example 3: location of blue rectangle is not correct - missing fill for outline
  - example 3: maroon rectangle is not outlined correctly
  - example 3: the blue rectangle did not use the correct position
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Find Maroon Rectangles:** Identify all rectangular objects of color maroon (9) in the input grid.
2.  **Outline Maroon Rectangles:** Draw a green (3) outline, one pixel thick, around each identified maroon rectangle.
3.  **Add Blue Rectangle:** Add a new blue (1) rectangle of size 4x7 to the top of the grid, starting on the third row.
4.  **Outline Blue Rectangle:** Draw a green (3) outline, one pixel thick, around the newly added blue rectangle. The rectangle should fill the area defined, even if that requires reducing the size.
5.  **Fill Adjacent Pixels:** Change the color of any white (0) pixels that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally) to a green (3) pixel to green (3).

Key Changes and Reasoning:

*   **Blue Rectangle Placement:** Instead of hardcoding the (2, 1) position, which only worked for the first example, the blue rectangle is placed relative to the top of the grid - "starting on the third row". This aligns with the observed behavior in all examples.
* **Blue Rectangle Size:** The size of the added rectangle should always be 4 x 7
* **Outline before fill**: The fill occurs after the outlines are in place

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
