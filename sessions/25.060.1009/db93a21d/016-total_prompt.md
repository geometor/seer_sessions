Okay, let's analyze this input-output example to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input grid contains three distinct maroon (color 9) rectangular shapes of varying sizes against a white (color 0) background.
*   **Output:** The output grid seems to retain the maroon shapes, but with some modifications:
    *   The maroon shapes are "framed" or outlined with green (color 3).
    *   There's a new blue (color 1) rectangle in a previously blank area, also outlined with green (color 3).
    *   Some white background pixels are converted to green.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: rectangle
    color: 9  # Maroon
    property: original
    size: variable
  - type: rectangle
    color: 1  # Blue
    property: new
    size: fixed
  - type: outline
    color: 3  # Green
    property: added
    thickness: 1
  - type: background
    color: 0 # White

actions:
  - type: outline
    target: rectangle
    color: 3
  - type: fill
    target: background
    color: 3
    condition: adjacent to outline

relationships:
    - subject: outline
      relation: surrounds
      object: rectangle
    - subject: green fill
      relation: adjacent_to
      object: outline
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify original rectangles:** Find all existing maroon (9) rectangles in the input grid.

2.  **Outline original rectangles:** Create a green (3) outline, one pixel thick, around each of the identified maroon rectangles.

3.  **Introduce new rectangle:** Add a new blue (1) rectangle of a fixed size (appears to be 4x7) in an empty region of the grid.

4.  **Outline New Rectangle:** Create a one-pixel thick green (3) outline around the new blue rectangle.

5. **Fill adjacent**: Change background white (0) pixels to green (3) if they are adjacent to the created green outline. The fill extends only one pixel thick.

Essentially, the transformation identifies existing shapes, outlines them, adds a new shape with an outline, and applies a limited fill operation to the background adjacent to the outlines.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
