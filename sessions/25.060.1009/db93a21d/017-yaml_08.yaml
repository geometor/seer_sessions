  The task involves identifying maroon rectangles, outlining them with green,
  adding a blue rectangle, outlining the blue rectangle in green,
  and filling white background adjacent to green with green.  The location of the
  blue rectangle changes in relation to the maroon rectangle.
objects:
  - color: 9  # Maroon
    type: rectangle
    action: outline
    outline_color: 3  # Green
  - color: 1  # Blue
    type: rectangle
    size: (4x7) # based on finding consistent size across all examples, not just (2,1),(8,4)
    action: add
    outline_color: 3 # Green
  - color: 3  # Green
    type: outline
    action: fill_adjacent
    fill_target: 0  # White
observations:
  - The blue rectangle is added at the top of the input grid.
  - The maroon rectangles are outlined.
  - White pixels adjacent to green pixels become green.
  - example 2: generated outline around blue rectangle is incorrect
  - example 2: location of the blue rectangle is incorrect
  - example 3: location of blue rectangle is not correct - missing fill for outline
  - example 3: maroon rectangle is not outlined correctly
  - example 3: the blue rectangle did not use the correct position
