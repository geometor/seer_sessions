The primary colors involved are white (0), maroon (9), green (3), and blue (1). There are distinct rectangular shapes formed by the maroon pixels. The transformation seems to involve outlining, expanding, and introducing new colors based on relative positions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this case we have two of such squares.\n\n2.  **Outline Maroon Squares:** For each identified maroon square, create a green (3) outline. The green outline replaces the white(0) pixels that are directly adjacent (up, down, left and right, not diagonally) to the maroon square, and maintains the original dimensions, hence the outline will be inside the grid and will be one pixel thick.\n\n3.  **Create Blue Rectangle:** Create a 2x6 blue (1) rectangle in the center-right portion of the grid. This blue block should start directly adjacent/to the right of the outline of the lower maroon block, spanning vertically six cells down.\n\n4. **Extend Green outline:** expand the green outlines created in step 2, so it become a filled rectangle of the same dimensions.\n\n5.  **Output:** The final output grid combines all these transformations.\n"
