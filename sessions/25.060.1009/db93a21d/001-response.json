The transformation seems to involve two main steps:\n\n1.  **Outlining:** Creating an outline around the maroon objects using green (3).\n2.  **Infilling:** Filling a region below, and sometimes above, the maroon objects and their outlines with blue (1). The infilling shape seems dependent on the original object's position and dimensions.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"
