Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are white (0), maroon (9), green (3), and blue (1).  The input grid appears to contain distinct regions of maroon pixels against a white background. The output grid introduces new colors (green and blue) and seems to expand or alter the existing maroon regions, as well as adding an outline. The shapes formed bear some resemblance to letters.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - objects:
      - name: maroon_region_1
        type: contiguous_region
        color: maroon (9)
        initial_position: [2,8]-[5,11] # Top-left and bottom-right corners
      - name: maroon_region_2
        type: contiguous_region
        color: maroon (9)
        initial_position: [6,3]-[7,4]
      - name: maroon_region_3
         type: contiguous_region
         color: maroon (9)
         initial_position: [9,13]-[10,14]
      - name: background
        type: background
        color: white (0)
  - actions:
      - name: expand_maroon_region_1
        type: expansion
        color: green(3) and original maroon(9)
      - name: expand_maroon_region_2
        type: expansion
        color: green(3) and original maroon(9)
      - name: expand_maroon_region_3
        type: expansion
        color: green(3) and original maroon(9)
      - action: add outline
        color: green(3)
      - action: fill region
        color: blue(1)
  - relationships:
      - type: containment
        description: "maroon regions are contained within the background"
      - type: expansion
        description: "maroon regions expand, adding green borders and turning part of the surrounding into green"
      - type: fill
        description: "A region within the expanded area becomes blue"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Maroon Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of maroon (9) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Expand Maroon Regions:** For each maroon region:
    * Add a 1 pixel green(3) outline on white pixels.
    * Expand any maroon region adjacent to any edge by turning the white pixel to green.
3.  **Fill Background:** Locate the isolated background region now surrounded by the expansion of the 3rd maroon region.
4.  **Color Background:** Color the area blue(1).

The transformation essentially identifies maroon colored objects in the input and expands their areas turning white cells to green while maintaining the original maroon region in the center, then it finds an enclosed area and colors that blue.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
