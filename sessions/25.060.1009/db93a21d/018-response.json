            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and the results of the generated code, along with a strategy for improving the natural language program and the code.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe code correctly identifies and outlines maroon rectangles. It also adds and outlines a blue rectangle. However, the positioning and size of this blue rectangle, and handling adjacent fill is not consistent across all examples. The primary issue is that the code's `transform` function is too specific to the first training example. It needs to generalize better to handle variations in the input grids, specifically regarding the added blue rectangle and white space fill.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors**\n\n1.  **Blue Rectangle Generalization:** The size and position of the blue rectangle should be determined dynamically based on properties of the input, or potentially based on constant values, but not hardcoded to a specific location that only works for first example.\n\n2.  **White Filling:** The `fill_adjacent` currently works. We need to make sure the filling happens after all the outlining and object placement to ensure correctness.\n\n3.  **Refine Object Identification:** The `find_objects` function appears to be working correctly. Ensure maroon rectangle finding is robust.\n\n4. **Parameterization:** The `add_new_rectangle` should not have any magic values for the position or size, we should find a relationship that is general across each of the examples provided.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis (using provided results, code assumed unchanged):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 12x11, Colors: \\[0, 9]\n    *   Output: 12x11, Colors: \\[0, 1, 3, 9]\n    *   Transformed: 12x11, Colors: \\[0, 1, 3, 9]\n    *   Comparison: Grids are identical.\n    *   Maroon objects in input: \\[((9, 10), (10, 11))]\n    *   Maroon objects in output: \\[((9, 10), (10, 11))]\n    *   *Assessment:* Perfect match. This is the example the code was based on.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 11x12, Colors: \\[0, 9]\n    *   Output: 11x12, Colors: \\[0, 1, 3, 9]\n    *   Transformed: 11x12, Colors: \\[0, 1, 3, 9]\n    *   Comparison: Differences found: (7, 0): 3 != 0; (7, 1): 9 != 0; (7, 2): 9 != 0; (7, 3): 9 != 0; (7, 4): 3 != 0; (8, 0): 9 != 0; (8, 1): 9 != 0; (8, 2): 9 != 0; (8, 3): 9 != 0; (8, 4): 3 != 0; (9, 0): 9 != 0; (9, 1): 9 != 0; (9, 2): 9 != 0; (9, 3): 9 != 0; (9, 4): 3 != 0; (10, 0): 3 != 0; (10, 1): 3 != 0; (10, 2): 3 != 0; (10, 3): 3 != 0; (10, 4): 3 != 0\n    *   Maroon objects in input: \\[((7, 9), (9, 11))]\n    *   Maroon objects in output: \\[((8, 9), (9, 11))]\n    *   *Assessment:* Incorrect. The blue rectangle and fill is correct. Green outline of maroon rectangle present, but the green fill around the maroon rectangle is spilling to the left edge, and below the outlined maroon rectangle\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 11x12, Colors: \\[0, 9]\n    *   Output: 11x12, Colors: \\[0, 1, 3, 9]\n    *   Transformed: 11x12, Colors: \\[0, 1, 3, 9]\n    *   Comparison: Differences found: (5, 10): 3 != 0; (5, 11): 3 != 0; (6, 11): 9 != 3\n    *   Maroon objects in input: \\[((5, 10), (6, 11))]\n    *   Maroon objects in output: \\[((6, 11), (6, 11))]\n    *   *Assessment:* Incorrect. Blue rectangle and fill are correct. The maroon outline/fill is not fully correct.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - description: \"Identify maroon rectangles in the input.\"\n    objects:\n      - type: rectangle\n        color: maroon (9)\n        properties:\n          - variable_size: True\n          - variable_position: True\n    actions:\n      - name: find_maroon_rectangles\n\n  - description: \"Outline the identified maroon rectangles with green.\"\n    objects:\n      - type: rectangle\n        color: green (3)\n    actions:\n      - name: outline_maroon_rectangles\n\n  - description: \"Add a blue rectangle to the grid.\"\n    objects:\n      - type: rectangle\n        color: blue (1)\n        properties:\n          - constant_size: [4,7] # height is 4, width is 7\n          - position: \"Always starts at row 3 (index 2), col 2 (index 1)\" # derived from output observation\n    actions:\n      - name: add_blue_rectangle\n  \n  - description: \"Outline the blue rectangle\"\n    objects:\n      - type: rectangle\n        color: green (3)\n    actions:\n      - name: outline_blue_rectangle\n\n  - description: \"Fill white pixels adjacent to green pixels with green.\"\n    actions:\n      - name: fill_adjacent_white\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Find Maroon Rectangles:** Locate all rectangular shapes of maroon (9) color within the input grid.\n2.  **Outline Maroon Rectangles:** Draw a green (3) border around each of the maroon rectangles found in the previous step. The outline should extend one pixel beyond the edges of the original rectangle on all sides.\n3.  **Add Blue Rectangle:** Create a new blue (1) rectangle with a fixed height of 4 and width of 7, The top-left corner is located at row 3, column 2 (using 0-based indexing).\n4. **Outline Blue Rectangle**: Draw a green border around the blue rectangle.\n5.  **Fill Adjacent White:** Change the color of any white (0) pixels that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a green (3) pixel to green (3).\n\n"
