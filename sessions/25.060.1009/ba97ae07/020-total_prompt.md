"""
The transformation identifies a blue vertical line and two distinct orange horizontal lines. The input grid is transformed only if the blue vertical line intersects *both* horizontal orange lines. If it intersects both, the pixel at the intersection of the blue line and the *lower* of the two orange horizontal lines changes from orange to blue. All other pixels remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. The provided test results show that while it correctly transforms the first example, it fails on the second, and third examples. It appears it does not correctly model the case in training set 2 because the output grid is empty (all white). The third example highlights a potential flaw or incompleteness in our rule, where a blue pixel from another source (not the vertical line) might interfere. It incorrectly transforms the third example, adding an additional blue pixel.

The overall strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Failures:** Carefully examine why the code failed on the second and third examples. Identify the discrepancies between the expected output and the actual output.
2.  **Refine the Rule:** Adjust the natural language program to account for the observed discrepancies. This might involve adding conditions, modifying existing ones, or introducing entirely new aspects to the rule.
3.  **Update YAML and Code:** Reflect the refined rule in the updated YAML description and, subsequently, in the Python code.

**Metrics and Observations (using hypothetical code execution and results)**

To better understand the failures, I need to simulate the outputs, by stepping through the code.

*   **Example 1:** (Correct)
    *   Input: Blue vertical line, two orange horizontal lines, intersection exists.
    *   Expected Output: Intersection at lower orange line becomes blue.
    *   Actual Output: Intersection at lower orange line becomes blue.
    *   *Metrics*: Matches expected.

*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)
    *   Input: No blue vertical line, two orange horizontal lines.
    *   Expected Output: No change (empty grid).
    *   Actual Output: No change (empty grid).
    *   *Metrics*: Matches expected.

*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect)
    *  Input: One blue vertical line (col=7), One blue pixel(2,2). Two orange horizontal lines (row 2 and 5).
    * Expected Output: The two orange lines intersect the blue vertical lines at (5,7). No change.
    *   Actual Output: changed (5,7) to blue
    *  *Metrics*: Does *not* match expected. There is an additional blue object (not a vertical line), that should not interfere with the execution of the rule.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: line
    orientation: vertical
    color: blue
    properties:
      length: >1
      start_position: (row, col) # To be determined during execution
  - type: line
    orientation: horizontal
    color: orange
    properties:
      length: >1
      start_position: (row, col) # To be determined during execution

actions:
  - find:
      description: Locate the blue vertical line.
      condition: Must exist.
  - find:
      description: Locate exactly two distinct orange horizontal lines.
      condition: Must exist.
  - check_intersection:
      description: Check if both orange lines intersect the blue line.
      condition: intersection exists.
  - identify_lower_line:
    description: if intersects with both, identify the lower of the two horizontal lines.
  - transform:
      description: Change the pixel color at the intersection of the blue vertical line and lower orange horizontal line.
      from: orange
      to: blue
      condition: The blue vertical line intersects both orange horizontal lines.

```

**Refined Natural Language Program**

The transformation identifies a blue vertical line and two distinct orange horizontal lines. The input grid is transformed *only* if all the following conditions are met:

1.  A blue vertical line exists (length > 1).
2.  Exactly two distinct orange horizontal lines exist (length > 1).
3.  Both of the orange horizontal lines intersect the blue vertical line.
4. The intersecting pixel is orange.

If all conditions are true, the pixel at the intersection of the blue line and the *lower* of the two orange horizontal lines changes from orange to blue. All other pixels remain unchanged. If any condition is false, the output grid is identical to the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
