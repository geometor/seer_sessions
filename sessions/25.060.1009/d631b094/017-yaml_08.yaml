- object: input grid
  properties:
      - dimensions: variable, can be any size.
  actions:
      - scanned: for non-zero pixels

- object: output_grid
  properties:
    - dimensions: 1 x N, where N is the count of non-zero pixels in the input.
    - values: contains the values of the non-zero pixels, in the order they are found. The order appears to be row major (left to right, top to bottom).
