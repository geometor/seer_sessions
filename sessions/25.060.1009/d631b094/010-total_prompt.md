**input:**
```
0 2 0
2 0 0
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7FC253D4F750>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x64 at 0x7FC253CC7B50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 1x3 grid. The colors present are white (0) and red (2). The input grid has red pixels arranged in a vertical line in the first column, and white elsewhere. The output grid consists of three red pixels, ignoring all white pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions:
      input: 3x3
      output: 1x3
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
        positions:
          input:  [[0, 0], [0, 2], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 2]]
          output: []
      - color: red
        value: 2
        positions:
          input:  [[0, 1], [1, 0], [2, 1]]
          output: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]]
transformation:
  - type: extract_color
    color: red
  - type: reshape
    dimensions: 1x3

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all red (value 2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Extract** these red pixels, discarding all other colors.
3.  **Reshape** the extracted red pixels into a 1x3 grid. In other words, create output to be a single row containing only the red pixels.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
