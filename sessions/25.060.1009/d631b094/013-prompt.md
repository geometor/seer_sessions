Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  Examine the input grid: Count the number of red pixels (pixels with a value of 2).
2.  Conditional Transformation:
    *   If red pixels are present: Extract all red pixels from the input grid. Arrange these extracted red pixels into a single row to form the output grid. The order of extraction should match a row major traversal (left to right, top to bottom).
    *   If no red pixels are present: The output grid is identical to the input grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize input_grid as numpy array
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    red_pixels = []

    # find all red pixels using row major traversal
    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            if input_grid[i, j] == 2:
                red_pixels.append(2)

    # if red pixels exist, create output grid, otherwise, the output is the input
    if len(red_pixels) > 0:
      output_grid = np.array(red_pixels).reshape(1, -1)
    else:
      output_grid = input_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
