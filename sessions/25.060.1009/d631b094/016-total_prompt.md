**input:**
```
0 7 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7FC253D0F5D0>

**output:**
```
7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7FC25B7C1CD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 1x1 grid. The input grid contains mostly '0' (white) pixels, with a single '7' (orange) pixel in the top-center position. The output grid consists of only the '7' (orange) pixel. It seems like the transformation extracts the non-zero pixel from the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    elements: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    properties:
      - has_a_non_zero_element: True
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [1, 1]
    elements: [7]
    properties:
      - is_a_single_element: True

actions:
  - type: extraction
    input: grid (3x3)
    output: grid (1x1)
    description: Extract the non-zero element from the input grid.

relationships:
  - The output grid's element is the single non-zero element present in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input grid.
2.  Identify the single non-zero pixel within the grid.
3.  Create a 1x1 output grid containing only the value of that identified non-zero pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
