**input:**
```
0 0 0
1 0 0
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7FC253D0FC50>

**output:**
```
1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x64 at 0x7FC253D4EFD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 1x2 grid. The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The output grid contains only 1s (blue). The blue pixels in the input seem to be related to the blue pixels of the output. The relative position of the blue pixels are changing and the white pixels appear to be ignored.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3] # Input grid dimensions
      elements: [0, 1]  # Pixel values (colors)
    id: input_grid

  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [1, 2] # Output grid dimensions
      elements: [1]     # Pixel values
    id: output_grid

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: white
      value: 0
    id: white_pixel

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: blue
      value: 1
    id: blue_pixel

actions:
  - type: count
    target: blue_pixel
    on: input_grid

  - type: create
    target: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: determined by blue pixel count.
      elements: blue pixels

relationships:
  -  relation: input contains
     entities: [input_grid, blue_pixel]

  - relation: input contains
    entities: [input_grid, white_pixel]

  -  relation: output contains
     entities: [output_grid, blue_pixel]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify and Count:** Examine the input grid and count the number of blue pixels (value 1).
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid. The dimensions are 1 x *N*, where *N* is the count of blue pixels from step 1.
3. **Populate:** Fill every cell of the output grid with a blue pixel (value 1).

In essence, the transformation extracts all blue pixels from the input grid and creates a condensed output grid containing only blue pixels, where the number of columns of the new grid is determined by the initial count of blue pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
