Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 1x3 grid. The colors present are white (0) and red (2). The input grid has red pixels arranged in a vertical line in the first column, and white elsewhere. The output grid consists of three red pixels, ignoring all white pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions:
      input: 3x3
      output: 1x3
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
        positions:
          input:  [[0, 0], [0, 2], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 2]]
          output: []
      - color: red
        value: 2
        positions:
          input:  [[0, 1], [1, 0], [2, 1]]
          output: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]]
transformation:
  - type: extract_color
    color: red
  - type: reshape
    dimensions: 1x3

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all red (value 2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Extract** these red pixels, discarding all other colors.
3.  **Reshape** the extracted red pixels into a 1x3 grid. In other words, create output to be a single row containing only the red pixels.
