**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of digits (representing colors) into another grid of digits. The input grids are all 3x3, while the output grids vary in size but seem to be 1 row with a variable number of columns, with repeated colored pixels. The core operation appears to be identifying the non-zero digits in the input grid and creating a new grid containing only those non-zero colors, repeated a number of times dependent on how many occurrences there are in the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (1 x N)
      - values: integers (0-9)

actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero
    input: input_grid
    output: list of non-zero values
  - name: create_output
    input: list of non-zero values
    output: output_grid
  - name: repeat_non_zero
      input: list of non-zero values
      output: sequence, repeating each non-zero digit by its number of occurences

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    rule: "The output grid contains all non-zero digits from the input grid, with number of repetitions of that digit."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Elements:** Examine the input grid and identify all cells with non-zero values.
2.  **Count each occurence:** Examine the input and count the number of times each non-zero digit appears.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Construct a new grid. For each non-zero value `n` in the input grid, add n columns to the output, repeating n times its digit.

Essentially, the transformation extracts the non-zero colored pixels from the input grid and repeats that color, the output grid contains that number of columns repeating the extracted value.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
