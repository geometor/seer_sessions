1.  Remove Gray: Eliminate all gray (5) pixels from the input grid.

2.  Identify Red Lines: Locate the original positions of the pre-existing vertical and horizontal red (2) lines in the input grid.

3.  Find New Red Lines: Find the new positions of the vertical and horizontal lines in a copy of the grid after removing the gray pixels.

4.  Calculate and Apply Shifts:

    *   Calculate the horizontal and vertical shift for both vertical and horizontal lines by comparing the before and after positions of the lines.
    *   Move the pre-existing lines to the new positions.
5. No change**: If, after removing the gray, there is no change in the grid, do not move any lines.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the initial code to the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example and made some assumptions that do not hold true for all examples. The core idea of removing gray pixels and then repositioning red lines based on their shift is partially correct. However, the current implementation has several limitations:

1.  **Incorrect Shift Calculation:** It assumes a single vertical and a single horizontal red line and calculates shifts based on the difference between their initial and final positions *after* gray removal. This fails when there are multiple red lines or when lines of the same orientation should move by different amounts (as seen in example 2).
2.  **Overwriting**: The logic that moves the red lines may have a flaw when red lines are close.
3. **Missing Unchanged Parts**: The current approach doesn't make sure the other parts of the grid that shouldn't move remain unchanged.

**Strategy for Improvement**

1.  **Object-Centric Approach:** Instead of focusing on "lines," we should think about individual red *segments*. Each contiguous block of red pixels along a row or column can be treated as a separate object.
2.  **Individual Shift Calculation:** Calculate the shift for *each* red segment independently.
3. **Preserve Unchanged**: Explicitly copy the parts of the output that don't require any operations based on grey removal or red movement.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Let's analyze each example, noting the initial state, actions, and outcomes. I'll use code execution where necessary to get more precise information.

      - contiguous: true # Either horizontally or vertically
      - orientation:  # Determined per segment
          - horizontal
          - vertical
    action:
      - shift:
          - direction: # Calculate based on gray removal.
              - up
              - down

          - amount: 0 # dynamic based on grey removal

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Remove Gray:** Eliminate all gray (color 5) pixels from the input grid, replacing them with black (color 0) pixels.

2.  **Identify Red Segments:** Identify all contiguous red (color 2) segments. A segment is a set of one or more adjacent red pixels in either a horizontal or vertical line.

3.  **Calculate Shifts:** For each red segment:
    *   Determine the segment's orientation (horizontal or vertical).
    *   Determine the presence and position of gray pixels relative to each red segment.
        *   If the segment is horizontal, calculate how many rows of gray pixels were *above* it in the input grid. This is the vertical shift amount.
        *   If the segment is vertical, calculate how many columns of gray pixels were to the *left* of it in the input grid. This is the horizontal shift amount.

4.  **Apply Shifts:** Create a copy of the grid *after* gray removal. For each red segment in this new grid, apply the calculated shift.
    * Move horizontal segments *up* by their vertical shift amount.
    * Move vertical segments *left* by their horizontal shift amount.
5. **Preserve**: If a pixel is not grey and not a moved red segment, its value from the input is preserved in the output.

This revised natural language program accounts for independent movement of red segments and handles cases where some red lines might not move at all. It also clarifies the relationship between gray pixel removal and red segment shifting.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
