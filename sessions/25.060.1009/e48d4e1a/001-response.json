The most prominent feature is the presence of lines forming a '+' shape within each grid. The transformation seems to focus on manipulating these '+' shapes, specifically their orientation and position. The gray '5' in the top right corner appears to be irrelevant. There also seems to be a consistent change of the horizontal part of the \"+\" shape in the output. The columns and rows with colored pixels swap, with a different pattern in where colored pixels appear.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
