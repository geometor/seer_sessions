            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined strategy.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy focused on identifying a yellow \"cross\" object and manipulating its vertical and horizontal bars. The code correctly identifies and moves the vertical bar to the first column. The horizontal bar is moved to a fixed row (index 6). However, the results show inconsistencies, indicating flaws in the horizontal bar logic. The code also completely works on the first two examples but is not right on the third example - the horizontal bar is not expanded completely.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate Horizontal Bar Logic:** The current logic assumes a fixed offset (+3) for the horizontal bar. This is incorrect, as evidenced by the analysis output. The new row should be determined consistently and correctly. The horizontal bar also needs to extend fully across the grid - the current logic is only using some portion of the original object.\n2.  **Consider Object Properties:** The code doesn't fully consider the object's properties (e.g., original position). We need to analyze how the original position of the cross relates to the output position.\n3. **Unified analysis** We need to analyze all three examples at once.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\nHere is a summary for each example based on the code output and the provided examples\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input Yellow Pixels:** 7\n*   **Expected Yellow Pixels:** 14\n*   **Actual Yellow Pixels:** 14\n*   **Input Yellow Positions:** (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n*   **Expected Yellow Positions:** (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n*   **Actual Yellow Positions:** (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input Yellow Pixels:** 7\n*   **Expected Yellow Pixels:** 14\n*   **Actual Yellow Pixels:** 14\n*   **Input Yellow Positions:** (4,4), (5,4), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,4)\n*   **Expected Yellow Positions:** (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n*   **Actual Yellow Positions:** (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input Yellow Pixels:** 6\n*   **Expected Yellow Pixels:** 14\n*   **Actual Yellow Pixels:** 13\n*   **Input Yellow Positions:** (4,4), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,4)\n*   **Expected Yellow Positions:** (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n*   **Actual Yellow Positions:** (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - id: cross\n    color: yellow\n    shape: cross-like\n    properties:\n      vertical_bar:\n        description: \"A vertical line of yellow pixels.\"\n        action: \"Moved to the first column (index 0) of the output grid.\"\n      horizontal_bar:\n        description: \"A horizontal line of yellow pixels.\"\n        action: \"Moved to row index 6, and extended through all columns.\"\ntransformation_rule: |\n    The transformation identifies a yellow 'cross' shaped object.\n    The vertical component of the cross is moved to the leftmost column of the output grid.\n    The horizontal component of the cross is moved to row index 6, replacing existing objects,\n    and expanding to include every column in that row.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Cross\":** Find the yellow (color 4) pixels that form a cross-like shape. The intersection point isn't crucial; we are interested in the vertical and horizontal lines.\n2.  **Move Vertical Bar:** The pixels forming the vertical line of the cross are all moved to the first column (column 0) of the output grid. Their original row positions are maintained.\n3. **Move and Expand the Horizontal Bar**: The pixels forming the horizontal part of the cross are moved to row 6. The horizontal bar is expanded/extended to the full width.\n4.  **Output:** All other cells in the output grid should be black (color 0). The horizontal bar should override any values from the vertical bar.\n\n"
