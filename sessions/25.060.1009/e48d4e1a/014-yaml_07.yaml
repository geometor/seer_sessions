transformation_rule: |
    The transformation identifies a yellow 'cross' shaped object.
    The vertical component of the cross is moved to the leftmost column of the output grid.
    The horizontal component of the cross is moved to row index 6, replacing existing objects,
    and expanding to include every column in that row.
