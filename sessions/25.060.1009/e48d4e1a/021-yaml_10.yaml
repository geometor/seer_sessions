examples:
  - example_id: 0
    input:
      magenta_object:
        shape: L_shape_3
        coords: [[5, 3], [5, 4], [5, 5]]
      gray_object:
        coords: [[3, 3], [4, 3]]
    output:
      magenta_object:
        shape: vertical_bar_3
        coords: [[4, 3], [5, 3], [6, 3]]
    action: Rotate magenta counter-clockwise 90 degrees, removing gray.
    notes: Successful rotation, and correct intersection handling.

  - example_id: 1
    input:
      magenta_object:
        shape: T_shape
        coords: [[3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6], [4, 3]]
      gray_object:
        coords:  [[2, 3], [2, 4]]
    output:
      magenta_object:
        shape: rotated_T
        coords: [[1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 4], [3, 4]]
    action: Rotate magenta counter-clockwise 90 degrees, removing gray.
    notes: Incorrect. The rotation did not produce the correct "rotated_T" and the intersection logic failed.

  - example_id: 2
    input:
      magenta_object:
        shape: L_shape_4
        coords: [[4, 1], [4, 2], [4, 3], [5, 1], [6, 1]]
      gray_object:
        coords: [[2, 1], [3, 1]]
    output:
      magenta_object:
        shape: rotated_L
        coords: [[3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3], [4, 3], [5, 3]]
    action: Rotate magenta 90 degrees counter-clockwise, removing gray.
    notes: Incorrect. The magenta pixels at [5,3] and [4,3] are in the wrong place. Should be one lower.
