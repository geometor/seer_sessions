The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and gray (5). The input grid contains a vertical red line, a horizontal red line intersecting at row 7 and what appears to be a gray shape that has the top and bottom corners missing. The output grid retains only parts of the red lines.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
