            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, correctly identifying the core concept of connected blue pixels being transformed to azure. However, the initial implementation of `is_connected_enhanced` had a flaw: it only needed to *find* a connected pixel, not verify that *all* connected pixels met a certain condition. The test results will reveal if this initial attempt worked or not and if additional considerations are necessary. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Examine Each Example:** Carefully analyze each input/output pair, focusing on where the code's output differs from the expected output.\n2.  **Identify Discrepancies:** Pinpoint the specific pixels that are causing the mismatches.\n3.  **Refine Connectivity Logic:** Adjust the `is_connected_enhanced` function and the overall `transform` function if necessary to correctly handle connectivity, potentially including concepts like size or shape of connected components.\n4. **Update natural language program**: Revise the natural language program to accurately and completely describe the transformation.\n\n**Example and Results Metrics**\nTo accurately document what is happening, it is very useful to have some reporting on the results, including:\n\n- count of blue pixels in the input\n- count of azure pixels in the expected output\n- count of azure pixels in the actual, generated output\n- count of `errors` - pixels that are different between expected and actual\n\nI will create a python script to report those metrics.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_metrics(input_grid, expected_output, actual_output):\n    \"\"\"Calculates metrics for the transformation.\"\"\"\n    input_blue_count = np.sum(input_grid == 1)\n    expected_azure_count = np.sum(expected_output == 8)\n    actual_azure_count = np.sum(actual_output == 8)\n    errors = np.sum(expected_output != actual_output)\n\n    return {\n        \"input_blue\": int(input_blue_count),\n        \"expected_azure\": int(expected_azure_count),\n        \"actual_azure\": int(actual_azure_count),\n        \"errors\": int(errors),\n    }\n\ndef test_transform_on_examples(transform_func, examples):\n    results = {}\n    for i, (input_grid, expected_output) in enumerate(examples):\n        input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n        expected_output = np.array(expected_output)\n        actual_output = transform_func(input_grid)\n        metrics = calculate_metrics(input_grid, expected_output, actual_output)\n        results[f\"example_{i}\"] = metrics\n        print(f\"Example {i}:\")\n        print(f\"  Metrics: {metrics}\")\n    return

For each blue pixel, check if it is connected to *any* other blue pixel. Connectivity includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors.\n4.  **Change Color of Connected Blue Pixels:** If a blue pixel is adjacent to at least one other blue pixel (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), change its color to azure (8).\n5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:**  All other pixels, including isolated blue pixels, remain unchanged.\n"
