The primary colors observed are maroon (9), blue (1), and azure (8). The input grid contains maroon and blue pixels, while the output grid replaces some of the blue pixels with azure, while others stay blue. The overall shape and structure, except those color changes, appears consistent. It seems the placement of maroon pixels are completely untouched.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Based on a very quick visual check, I am going to *hypothesize* that a blue pixel becomes azure if an only if they do not touch the edge *or* other blue pixels. I need to think about if and how I can express the \"touch\" rule succinctly, it might be:\n\n*  if the original blue has only maroon neighbors (up, down, right, left, diagonals included), convert the blue pixel to azure.\n\nLet me confirm this quickly for a sample:\n\nLooking specifically at row 2 in the provided example, it is `9 1 1 1 1 1 9 9 1 9 9` and the row becomes `9 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 1 9 9`.\nThe first blue pixel is adjacent to a maroon pixel above, a maroon below, a maroon to the left, and a blue to the right. It becomes azure, fitting the hypothesis. The sixth blue on the row only has a maroon neighbor, so it's also azure.\nThe second-to-last blue pixel is adjacted to 2 blues, so it remains.\n\nI need to verify against other rows but this seems promising.\n"
