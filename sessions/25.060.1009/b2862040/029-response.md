"""
1.  **Identify Contiguous Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. A contiguous region is a group of one or more blue pixels that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right).
2.  **Determine Region Size:** Calculate the size of each identified blue region (the number of pixels in the region).
3.  **Conditional Color Change:** If a blue region's size is greater than 1, change the color of *all* pixels within that region to azure (8). If the blue region's size is 1 or less, do not change any pixels in this region.
4. **Other Pixels:** Pixels that are not part of a blue contiguous region are not affected.
