Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and the hypothesized transformation rule for the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a numerical value representing a color. The primary colors observed are maroon (9), blue (1), and azure (8). The input grid appears to have distinct regions of blue (1) pixels embedded within a maroon (9) background. The transformation seems to selectively change some of the blue (1) pixels to azure (8), while leaving other blue and all maroon pixels untouched.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 14
      columns: 15
      colors: [maroon, blue, azure]
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          color: maroon #or blue or azure
          location: [row, col]

actions:
  - name: change_color
    properties:
      subject: pixel
      from_color: blue
      to_color: azure
    conditions:
      - "blue pixel is adjacent to another blue pixel, forming a contiguous blue region of size >1"

relationships:
    - type: adjacency
      between: [pixel, pixel]
      properties:
        - horizontal
        - vertical

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Regions:** Locate all blue (1) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Determine Contiguous Regions:** Group adjacent blue pixels (horizontally or vertically) into contiguous regions.
3.  **Filter Regions:** Identify blue regions that consist of more than one pixel.
4. **Transform Color of filtered regions** Change blue regions that consist of more that one pixel from blue(1) to azure(8).
5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (maroon and any single, isolated blue pixel) remain unchanged.
6.  **Output:** Generate the output grid with the modified pixel colors.

In simpler terms, the rule changes connected groups of blue pixels to azure, leaving single, isolated blue pixels unchanged. The surrounding maroon background is entirely unaffected.
