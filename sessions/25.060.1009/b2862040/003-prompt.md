Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Background:** The background color is maroon (9).
2.  **Identify Foreground:** The foreground objects are composed of blue (1) pixels.
3.  **Iterate Blue Pixels:** Examine each blue pixel in the input grid.
4.  **Check Connectivity:** Check if the blue pixel is part of a connected component (horizontal or vertical adjacency).
5.  **Replace Color:** If a blue pixel is part of connected set of 1 or more blue pixels (horizontal or vertical), change its color to azure (8).
6.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** Leave all maroon (9) pixels unchanged, and the blue (1) pixels unchanged if not adjacent to any other pixels.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
