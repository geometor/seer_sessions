In the output, some of the blue (1) pixels are changed to azure (8), while others remain blue (1). The maroon (9) pixels remain unchanged. The change seems to be selective and related to the shape or configuration of the blue objects. It appears that isolated blue pixels or blue pixels that form part of a contiguous block are getting replaced with azure (8).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
