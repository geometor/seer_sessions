            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine our natural language program and understanding of the transformation.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were based on the first training example. The tests against the other training examples show the code is incorrect for at least example 2. The core issue appears to be an oversimplification of the conditions under which yellow (4) pixels are changed to blue (1). The initial rule focused on the southern and eastern neighbors, but the actual rule is likely more complex, perhaps even involving the entire row or shape. We need to shift from simple neighbor checks to a more holistic view of the pixel's context within the grid.\n\nMy strategy is as follows:\n\n1. **Detailed Example Analysis:** For each example, meticulously compare the input and output grids, noting *exactly* which pixels changed and which didn't. We will include counts of changed pixels.\n2. **Identify False Positives and Negatives:** Determine where the existing code *incorrectly* changed a pixel (false positive) and where it *failed* to change a pixel that should have been changed (false negative).  We will include counts for these, also.\n3. **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, adjust the hypothesis about the transformation rule. Consider factors beyond immediate neighbors, such as object shape, row completion.\n4. **Natural Language Program Update:** Re-write the natural language program to reflect the refined hypothesis.\n5. **Fact Documentation and re-evaluation of strategy**: Use the new findings to reassess and adjust my strategy as needed.\n\n**Example and Results Analysis (using code execution where appropriate)**\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_results(input_grids, output_grids, predicted_grids):\n    results = []\n    for i, (input_grid, output_grid, predicted_grid) in enumerate(zip(input_grids, output_grids, predicted_grids)):\n        input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n        output_grid = np.array(output_grid)\n        predicted_grid = np.array(predicted_grid)\n\n        changed_correctly = np.sum((predicted_grid != input_grid) & (predicted_grid == output_grid))\n        changed_incorrectly = np.sum((predicted_grid != input_grid) & (predicted_grid != output_grid))\n        unchanged_incorrectly = np.sum((predicted_grid == input_grid) & (predicted_grid != output_grid))\n        total_changed_in_output = np.sum(output_grid != input_grid)\n        total_pixels = input_grid.size\n\n\n        results.append({\n            \"example_index\": i,\n            \"changed_correctly\": int(changed_correctly),\n            \"changed_incorrectly\": int(changed_incorrectly),\n            \"unchanged_incorrectly\": int(unchanged_incorrectly),\n            \"total_changed_in_output\": int(total_changed_in_output),\n            \"total_pixels\": int(total_pixels)\n        })\n\n    return results\n\n# dummy data for demonstration - replace with actual task data\ninput_grids = [\n    [[4, 0, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4], [0, 4, 0, 4]],\n    [[4, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4]],\n    [[4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 0, 0, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]\n]\noutput_grids = [\n    [[4, 0, 1, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4], [0, 4, 0, 4]],\n    [[1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4]],\n    [[4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 0, 0, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]\n]\npredicted_grids = [\n    [[4, 0, 1, 4], [4, 4, 1, 4], [0, 4, 0, 4]],\n    [[1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1]],\n    [[4, 4, 4, 4, 1], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 0, 0, 4, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]\n\n]\n\nanalysis = analyze_results(input_grids, output_grids, predicted_grids)\nprint(analysis)\n\n```"
