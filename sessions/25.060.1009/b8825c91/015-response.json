The dimensions of the grid are 16x16. The colors used seem arbitrary but consistent within the grid. The most prominent feature is a central \"diamond\" or \"cross\" shape formed by different colored pixels. There are also seemingly random arrangements of colored pixels in the outer regions of the grid. The output grid closely resembles the input, with notable change.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It is observed that there is a vertical and horizontal flipping, or a 180 degree rotation. The yellow '4' colored region in the lower-left is transformed in the output to be in the upper-right.\n\n5. **Produce output:** With this transformation, reproduce the output.\n"
