            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a simple color replacement rule. The provided code correctly implements this rule. The test results confirm that this rule is consistent across all training examples. Therefore, no changes are necessary to either the code or the original natural language description. The strategy is to verify the consistency of the transformation across all examples and ensure that no unexpected side effects or edge cases are present. Given that the existing solution is accurate, the focus will be on generating the requested information/report.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nSince all training examples passed with the original transformation, running the code would not yield any insights. The key information is that the same transformation (yellow to green, azure to maroon) works for all examples. We'll extract the sizes as \"metrics\".\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input: 3x3, Output: 3x3\n*   **Example 2:** Input: 5x5, Output: 5x5\n*   **Example 3:** Input: 7x7, Output: 7x7\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: color_replacement\nexamples:\n  - input_size: 3x3\n    output_size: 3x3\n    transformations:\n      - replace_color:\n          original: 4  # yellow\n          new: 3      # green\n      - replace_color:\n          original: 8  # azure\n          new: 9      # maroon\n  - input_size: 5x5\n    output_size: 5x5\n    transformations:\n      - replace_color:\n          original: 4\n          new: 3\n      - replace_color:\n          original: 8\n          new: 9\n  - input_size: 7x7\n    output_size: 7x7\n    transformations:\n      - replace_color:\n          original: 4\n          new: 3\n      - replace_color:\n          original: 8\n          new: 9\nobjects:\n  - description: Entire grid, representing a collection of colored pixels.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe program performs a simple color substitution on the input grid. All instances of color 4 (yellow) are replaced with color 3 (green), and all instances of color 8 (azure) are replaced with color 9 (maroon). The grid dimensions remain unchanged.\n"
