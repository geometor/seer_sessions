Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying a closed green region and filling its interior with yellow. The subsequent tests reveal that this approach is not universally applicable to all examples. Some examples involve multiple disconnected green regions, regions that are not closed, or no green regions at all. The current `is_closed_region` and `find_internal_pixels` are causing the failures.

The primary issue is that the code assumes a *single, closed* green region. It needs to be generalized to handle:

1.  **Multiple Disconnected Regions:** The code should iterate through all distinct green regions, not just assume one.
2.  **Open Regions:** The concept of "filling the interior" only applies to closed regions. Open regions should either be ignored or handled differently (e.g. some other rule should be applied). The provided examples hint the filling occurs only if a region is closed.
3. **No Green Regions:** return input as output.

The strategy will be to:

1.  **Refine Region Identification:** Modify the code to correctly identify all distinct green regions, regardless of whether they are closed or open. This can be achieved by iterating through all green pixels and using a flood-fill or connected component labeling algorithm.
2.  **Conditional Filling:** The "filling" operation should be strictly conditional, applying *only* to regions that meet the criteria of being closed.
3.  **Metrics:** For each example, document:
    *   Number of distinct green regions.
    *   Whether each region is open or closed.
    *   Whether the filling was applied correctly according to the "closed region" rule.
4.  **Refine natural language program:** based on the results and metrics gathered, rewrite it.

**Code Execution for Metrics and Analysis**

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Green Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of green (value 3) pixels in the input grid.  A region is defined as a set of green pixels connected by 8-way adjacency.
2.  **Check for Closure:** For each identified green region, determine if it is "closed." A region is closed if all of its pixels are completely surrounded by non-green pixels within the grid boundaries. If any green pixel in a region touches the edge of the grid, the region isn't closed.
3.  **Conditional Filling:** If and *only if* a green region is determined to be closed, fill the interior of that region with yellow (value 4). The interior pixels are green pixels within a closed region and completely surrounded by other green pixels of that same region.
4. **Output:** Create an output grid. If there are no green regions, output should be same as input. Copy not modified regions from input to output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
