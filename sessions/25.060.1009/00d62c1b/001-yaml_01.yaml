objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - cells: contain integer values (0-9) representing colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          - 0: white
          - 3: green
          - 4: yellow
      - position: (row, column)
      - adjacency:  pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side (not diagonal)

actions:
  - type: color_change
    properties:
      - from_color: 3 (green)
      - to_color: 4 (yellow)
    conditions:
      - adjacency: The green pixel is adjacent to other green pixels. The extent and logic of the transformation needs further clarification.

relationships:
    - adjacency: determines which pixels are considered neighbors
    - connectivity: groups of adjacent pixels of the same color form connected regions or shapes.
