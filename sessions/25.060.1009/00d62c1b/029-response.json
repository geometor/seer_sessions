            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying interior green pixels and changing them to yellow. This rule works for the first example but fails on the others. The other examples introduce additional considerations. The failures indicate that the current program is too specific and needs to generalize to handle different scenarios present in the other examples. The program fails on example three because there is no background to consider. We need to consider edge cases to make sure we are accounting for all possibilities and revise the natural language program and resulting code.\n\n**Strategy:**\nMy strategy is to check the actual results against the expected results and then update the natural language program based on these deltas.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\nHere's a breakdown of each example and the observed results:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid with a green border and a single yellow pixel in the center.\n    *   Expected Output: Same as input.\n    *   Actual Output: Same as input.\n    *   Result: Success.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 7x7 grid with green squares in the corners and center, forming a '+' shape.\n    *   Expected Output: Same as input.\n    *   Actual Output: Same as input.\n    *   Result: Success.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid, entirely green.\n    *   Expected Output: 3x3 grid, entirely green.\n    *   Actual output: middle pixel changed to yellow\n    *   Result: Failure, only center pixel should be yellow.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  input:\n    objects:\n      - type: rectangle\n        color: green\n        description: outer border\n      - type: pixel\n        color: yellow\n        description: center pixel\n    background:\n      color: white\n  output:\n     objects:\n      - type: rectangle\n        color: green\n        description: outer border\n      - type: pixel\n        color: yellow\n        description: center pixel\n    background:\n      color: white\n  transformation:\n    rule: \"No change, all objects within the background remain the same.\"\n\nexample_2:\n  input:\n    objects:\n      - type: shape\n        color: green\n        description: '+' shape made of 5 squares\n    background:\n      color: white\n  output:\n    objects:\n      - type: shape\n        color: green\n        description: '+' shape made of 5 squares\n    background:\n      color: white\n  transformation:\n    rule: \"No change, the green '+' shape within the white background remains unchanged\"\n\nexample_3:\n  input:\n    objects:\n      - type: rectangle\n        color: green\n        description: entire grid\n  output:\n    objects:\n      - type: rectangle\n        color: green\n        description: entire grid\n  transformation:\n    rule: \"No change. the green color is not changed.\"\n\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Iterate through all pixels.\n2.  If a pixel is green determine if there is a white neighbor. If so, leave it green. If a pixel is completely surrounded by green, change it to yellow.\n3.  If there is no background, do not make any transformations.\n\n"
