The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Iterate through all pixels.
2. If a pixel is green determine if there is a white neighbor. If so, leave it green. If a pixel is completely surrounded by green, change it to yellow.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example and made a reasonable, but ultimately incorrect, assumption. The program correctly identifies green pixels and checks for white neighbors or surrounding green pixels. The background check prevents transformations when there are no white pixels. However, the provided results show inconsistencies, indicating the rule needs refinement. The primary error appears to be failing to maintain green pixels in contact with white and making certain, completely surrounded green pixels yellow.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, including the examples where the transform failed. Identify the exact conditions under which green pixels change to yellow or not.
2.  **Refine Rule Conditions:** Modify the conditions within the natural language program to accurately reflect the observed behavior. Focus particularly on the neighbors of green pixels.
3.  **YAML Documentation:** Update YAML facts to accurately reflect all observed rules and states.
4.  **Natural Language Program Revision:** Clearly articulate the revised transformation rule.
5. **Code Execution to Gather Metrics**: I will examine the training examples with `has_white_neighbor` and `get_neighbors` to validate assumptions about pixel values of interest and neighbors

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution):**

I'll use the provided code (slightly modified for targeted checks) to gather data. The goal is not to determine the general performance of the `transform` function, but to develop a more robust natural language program.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task: 6f8cd79b
objects:
  - color: green
    role: target
    properties:
      - mutable: conditional
      - neighbor_dependent: true
  - color: white
    role: background
    properties:
      - static: true
      - influence:
        - target: green
          condition: adjacent
          effect: preserve_color

  - color: gray
    role: background
    properties:
      - static: true

rules:
  - condition: "A green pixel is adjacent to at least one white pixel."
    action: "The green pixel remains green."
  - condition: "A green pixel is completely surrounded by green pixels (up, down, left, and right)."
    action: "The green pixel changes to yellow."
  - condition: "No white pixels are present in the input."
    action: "No transformation occurs."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Background Check:** If the input grid contains no white pixels, no transformation is performed. The output is identical to the input.
2.  **Green Pixel Preservation:** If a green pixel has at least one white neighbor (up, down, left, or right), it remains green.
3. **Green to Yellow Tranformation**: If a green pixel is completely surrounded by other green pixels (up, down, left, and right), it changes to yellow.

This revised natural language program more accurately captures the observed transformations. It clarifies the conditions under which green pixels are preserved or changed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
