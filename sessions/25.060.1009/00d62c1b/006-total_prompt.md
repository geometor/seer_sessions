Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were on the right track, focusing on the interaction between green (3) pixels. However, the implementation has a critical flaw: it *overwrites* existing colors with yellow (4) instead of *inserting* yellow pixels, which would require resizing the grid. The provided examples in the results show this clearly: the output grids have the same dimensions as the input grids, but adjacent green pixels have had one replaced by a yellow pixel. This runs contrary to the concept of adding a new element *between* existing ones, which by its nature would cause an extension or insertion. Additionally, example 3, where there are no changes is not handled at all by the initial attempt. We must adjust our strategy to consider a dynamic resizing of the grid where necessary, and to incorporate the observation of no change.

**Metrics and Observations (per example)**

Here's a breakdown of each example, highlighting key observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with two vertically adjacent green pixels.
    *   Expected Output: 4x3 grid with a yellow pixel inserted between the green pixels.
    *   Actual Output: 3x3 grid with the top green pixel replaced by yellow.
    *   Observation: The code replaces rather than inserts. The grid needs to expand.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5 grid with horizontally adjacent green pixels in the top row and a group of 4 green pixels in a square.
    *   Expected Output: Describes insertion between each green pixel.
    *   Actual Output: Similar to example 1, replacements, not insertions.
    *   Observation: Confirms the insertion problem, and indicates that any adjacent 3 needs a 4, not only pairs.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with no green pixels.
    *   Expected Output: 3x3 grid (identical to input).
    *    Actual output: 3x3 grid (identical to input).
    *   Observation: Correct. Must make note of this edge case.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
observations:
  - example: 1
    input_shape: 3x3
    output_shape: 4x3
    input_objects:
      - color: 3
        positions: [(1,1), (2,1)]
        adjacency: vertical
    output_objects:
      - color: 3
        positions: [(1,1), (3,1)]
      - color: 4
        positions: [(2,1)]
    transformation: insertion
    insertion_details: Insert yellow (4) between vertically adjacent green (3) pixels.
    grid_change: Height increased by 1.

  - example: 2
    input_shape: 5x5
    output_shape: 7x7
    input_objects:
      - color: 3
        positions:  [(0, 1), (0, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)]
        adjacency: horizontal and vertical (clustered)
    output_objects:
      - color: 3
      - color: 4
    transformation: insertion
    insertion_details: Insert yellow (4) between all horizontally and vertically adjacent green (3) pixels.
    grid_change:  Height and Width Increased

  - example: 3
    input_shape: 3x3
    output_shape: 3x3
    input_objects: []
    output_objects: []
    transformation: none
    insertion_details: No green pixels, no changes.
    grid_change: No change.

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Green Pixels:** Scan the input grid to locate all pixels with the color green (value 3).

2.  **Check for Adjacency:** For each green pixel, check for adjacent green pixels in the horizontal and vertical directions.

3.  **Insert Yellow Pixels:**
    *   If two or more green pixels are adjacent horizontally, insert a column of yellow (4) pixels between them. The new column should match the row dimensions of the original grid.
    *   If two or more green pixels are adjacent vertically, insert a row of yellow (4) pixels between them. The new row should match the column dimensions of the grid.

4.  **Handle No Change:** If there are no green pixels in the input grid, the output grid is identical to the input grid.

5. **Grid Expansion**: Note that insertion will change grid size.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
