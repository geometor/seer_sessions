The input grid contains a shape formed by pixels of value 3 (green), surrounded by pixels of value 0 (white). The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid. The key difference is the appearance of pixels with value 4 (yellow) in the output. These yellow pixels appear within the boundaries of the original green shape, specifically in a contiguous block.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
