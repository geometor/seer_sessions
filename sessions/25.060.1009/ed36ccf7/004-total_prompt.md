**input:**
```
9 0 0
9 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7FC25B62DFD0>

**output:**
```
0 9 9
0 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7FC25B62F3D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid contains maroon (9) and white (0) pixels. The output grid also contains maroon and white pixels, but their positions have changed. The transformation appears to be a simple rearrangement of the existing pixels rather than any change in color or introduction of new pixels. The key seems to be understanding *how* the pixels are repositioned.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: [maroon, white]

actions:
  - type: reposition
    description: Pixels are moved within the grid.
    constraints:
      - No new pixels are added.
      - No pixels are removed.
      - Colors are preserved.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The relative positions of pixels change between input and output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation performs a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the upper-left 2x2 subgrid of the input.

1.  **Identify Subgrid:** Focus on the 2x2 subgrid located at the top-left corner of the input grid.
2.  **Rotate:** Rotate this 2x2 subgrid 90 degrees clockwise. That is, shift each sub-grid as follows
    *   top-left pixel to the top-right position,
    *   top-right pixel to the bottom-right position
    *   bottom-right pixel to the bottom-left postion, and
    *   bottom-left pixel to the top-left position.
3.  **Preserve Rest:** All other pixels (those outside of identified 2x2 area) remain in their original positions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
