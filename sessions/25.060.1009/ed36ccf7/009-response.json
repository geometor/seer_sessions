The input grid contains pixels of two colors: magenta (6) and white (0). The output grid also contains magenta and white pixels, but their arrangement is different. The core transformation seems to involve a redistribution of the magenta and white pixels. It appears as though the magenta pixels are \"moving\" or being \"rearranged\".\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
