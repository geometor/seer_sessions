Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation performs a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the upper-left 2x2 subgrid of the input.

1.  **Identify Subgrid:** Focus on the 2x2 subgrid located at the top-left corner of the input grid.
2.  **Rotate:** Rotate this 2x2 subgrid 90 degrees clockwise. That is, shift each sub-grid as follows
    *   top-left pixel to the top-right position,
    *   top-right pixel to the bottom-right position
    *   bottom-right pixel to the bottom-left postion, and
    *   bottom-left pixel to the top-left position.
3.  **Preserve Rest:** All other pixels (those outside of identified 2x2 area) remain in their original positions.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code correctly identified the core concept: a 90-degree clockwise rotation of a 2x2 subgrid. However, it incorrectly assumed this subgrid was *always* at the top-left corner (0, 0). The additional training examples reveal that the location of the 2x2 subgrid that undergoes rotation is variable, and a critical aspect missed. My error arises because my prior was biased due to only using the first example. We need to determine the criteria for selecting the *correct* 2x2 subgrid to rotate.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze all Examples:** Examine all input/output pairs, looking for consistent properties of the rotating 2x2 subgrid that distinguish it from other 2x2 subgrids. I hypothesize that color will play a significant role in selecting the correct subgrid, since position does not.
2.  **Identify Selection Rule:** Determine the selection rule for the rotating subgrid. Is it a specific color, a combination of colors, or some other property?
3.  **Refine Program:** Update the natural language program to incorporate this selection rule, making the location of the rotation dynamic rather than fixed.
4. Create a YAML block with facts and properties that were observed.

**Metrics and Observations (using code_execution where necessary):**
I will execute small python snippets to explore the grid properties.

        result: Rotation at (0,0) confirmed.

  - conclusion: |
        In examples 2 and 3, the top-left 2x2 subgrid containing an 8 in the top-left corner is rotated. 
        Example 1 has no 8, so no rotation.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Potential Subgrids:** Examine all possible 2x2 subgrids within the input grid.
2.  **Locate Target Subgrid:** Find the 2x2 subgrid where the top-left cell is color 8 (azure).
3.  **Handle Absence:** If no such subgrid exists, the output is identical to the input.
4.  **Rotate:** If the target subgrid is found, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.
    *   The top-left cell moves to the top-right position.
    *   The top-right cell moves to the bottom-right position.
    *   The bottom-right cell moves to the bottom-left position.
    *   The bottom-left cell moves to the top-left position.
5.  **Preserve Rest:** All other pixels in the grid that are not part of the rotating subgrid remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
