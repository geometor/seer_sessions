```python
"""
The transformation performs a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the upper-left 2x2 subgrid of the input.

1.  **Identify Subgrid:** Focus on the 2x2 subgrid located at the top-left corner of the input grid.
2.  **Rotate:** Rotate this 2x2 subgrid 90 degrees clockwise. That is, shift each sub-grid as follows
    *   top-left pixel to the top-right position,
    *   top-right pixel to the bottom-right position
    *   bottom-right pixel to the bottom-left postion, and
    *   bottom-left pixel to the top-left position.
3.  **Preserve Rest:** All other pixels (those outside of identified 2x2 area) remain in their original positions.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
