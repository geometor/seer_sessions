Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and the proposed transformation rule for the given ARC-AGI task.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit, representing a color. The transformation seems to involve a swap of values between some of the cells. There's a clear diagonal or rotational symmetry to be observed. The non-zero color swaps between the top left and the remaining parts of the first row and the first column, preserving their relative positions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_size: 3x3
objects:
  - type: cell
    properties:
      value: integer (0-9)
      color: derived_from_value
      position: row, col
actions:
  - type: swap
    parameters:
      source: cell_position_1
      target: cell_position_2
relationships:
  - type: diagonal_symmetry # Possible relationship
  - type: rotation
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation can be described as a 90 degree clockwise rotation of a specific subset of the input grid data - a "colored cross".

1.  **Identify the "colored cross":** Find the positions where non-zero value exists and is not equal to the value in the center of input, and create an image that contains a "colored cross" by swapping this non-zero value with values equal to the value in the center of the input.

2.  **Rotate:** Rotate only the elements in the colored cross 90 degrees clockwise. The center cell and any cell who's initial value is equal to the initial value of center remains unchanged.

3. **Construct Output:** Create output grid from the data in step 2.
