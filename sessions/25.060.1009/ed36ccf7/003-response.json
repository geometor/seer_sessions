The input grid contains maroon (9) and white (0) pixels. The output grid also contains maroon and white pixels, but their positions have changed. The transformation appears to be a simple rearrangement of the existing pixels rather than any change in color or introduction of new pixels. The key seems to be understanding *how* the pixels are repositioned.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
