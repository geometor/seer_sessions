Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves rearranging the magenta (6) and white (0) pixels within a 3x3 grid. The number of magenta and white pixels remains constant. All magenta pixels, up to a maximum of three, are moved to the first column of the grid. Any remaining cells in the first column, and all other cells, are filled with white (0) pixels. If there are no magenta pixels, the grid remains all white.
"""

import numpy as np

def get_pixels_by_color(grid, color):
    """
    Returns a list of (row, col) tuples representing the coordinates of pixels of the specified color.
    """
    return [(row, col) for row in range(grid.shape[0]) for col in range(grid.shape[1]) if grid[row, col] == color]

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule.
    """
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    magenta_pixels = get_pixels_by_color(input_grid, 6)
    white_pixels = get_pixels_by_color(input_grid, 0)

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
