Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Color Transformations:**
    *   All pixels with color blue (1) are changed to green (3), except where the blue(1) is adjacent to a black(0).
    *   All pixels with color yellow (4) are changed to green (3).
    *   All pixels with color black (0) remain black (0)
2.  **Row Handling:**
    * Any row that is all yellow(4) becomes green(3) and is only included in the final output if it is immediately followed by a row that contains colors other than only 4.
    *   Rows that contain only the color red (2) are removed.
    *   Rows that contains red(2) and black(0) is removed
    *   If the final row is all black(0), remove it.
3. **Output Construction** The output grid is constructed from the transformed rows, excluding rows as specified.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the derived code have several discrepancies with the observed results across the training examples. The primary issues seem to stem from:

1.  **Incorrect Conditional Row Inclusion:** The logic for including rows based on their content (all yellow, followed by a row with non-yellow pixels) does not correctly model all conditions from the examples. The actual rule appears more nuanced.
2. **Incomplete Row Removal**: The examples show row removal that isn't captured, rows not containing all red.
3. **Misinterpretation of pixel transformation:** There are edge cases that are being missed, like how black pixels are added at times.

The strategy for resolving these errors will involve:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examining *each* input/output pair to identify *precisely* when rows are included, excluded, or modified. Use code execution to determine exact pixel values.
2.  **Conditional Logic Refinement:** Rewriting the row inclusion/exclusion logic to match the observed behavior, likely moving away from a simple "all yellow" check and including more complex surrounding row/pixel consideration.
3.  **Precise Pixel Transformation:** Examine how the pixel transformation changes based on their position or adjacency.

**Metrics and Example Analysis (using Code Execution)**

To get precise metrics, I'll use the `code_execution` tool to compare the expected outputs with the actual outputs of the `transform` function. I'll focus on:

*   Dimensions of input, expected output, and actual output.
*   Pixel-by-pixel differences between expected and actual outputs.
* The exact colors present in each row.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def compare_outputs(example_inputs, example_outputs, transform_function):
    results = []
    for i, (input_grid, expected_output) in enumerate(zip(example_inputs, example_outputs)):
        actual_output = transform_function(input_grid)
        input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
        expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
        
        #check if type is the same
        if(type(actual_output) != type(expected_output)):
            print("Type mismatch")
            continue

        dims_match = actual_output.shape == expected_output.shape
        pixel_diffs = []
        if dims_match:
            for r in range(expected_output.shape[0]):
                for c in range(expected_output.shape[1]):
                    if actual_output[r, c] != expected_output[r, c]:
                        pixel_diffs.append(((r, c), actual_output[r, c], expected_output[r, c]))
        
        row_colors = []        
        if actual_output.shape[0] > 0: #check that there are rows.
            for r in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
                row_colors.append(list(np.unique(input_grid[r])))


        results.append({
            "example_index": i,
            "input_dims": input_grid.shape,
            "expected_dims": expected_output.shape,
            "actual_dims": actual_output.shape,
            "dims_match": dims_match,
            "pixel_diffs": pixel_diffs,
            "input_row_colors": row_colors
        })
    return results

# Example Usage (replace with actual task data):
task_data = task["train"]
example_inputs = [example["input"] for example in task_data]
example_outputs = [example["output"] for example in task_data]

comparison_results = compare_outputs(example_inputs, example_outputs, transform)
print(comparison_results)
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
