            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided input-output example:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a larger, multi-colored grid (input) into a smaller, mostly single-colored grid (output). The input grid contains various colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to predominantly feature a single color (green, represented by '3'), with some white (0) pixels. The output grid is significantly smaller in dimensions compared to the input grid. There appears to be a relationship between specific colored regions in the input and the placement of '3's in the output, specifically focusing where non-white colors occur in blocks, while areas with some white get converted to 0 in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Within each 2x2 sub-grid\n    *  If the whole 2x2 subgrid is non-white pixels, then the output pixel = 3\n    *  Else, the output pixel = 0.\n\nIn summary, the transformation takes overlapping 2x2 sections of the original image, and maps them to the output grid. The contents of that 2x2 map determine the output pixel value.\n"
