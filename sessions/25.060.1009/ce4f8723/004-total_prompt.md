Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to consist primarily of green (3) and white (0). There appears to be some relationship between the non-zero, non-white colored blocks in the input, and areas of green in the output. There's a reduction in dimensions, suggesting a summarizing or downscaling operation. The input has distinct horizontal sections of different colors.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is larger than the output grid.
  - input_dimensions: 9x4 (rows x columns) from text, confirmed by image.
  - output_dimensions: 4x4 (rows x columns) from text, confirmed by image.
  - input_colors:
    - 0 (white)
    - 1 (blue)
    - 2 (red)
    - 4 (yellow)
  - output_colors:
    - 0 (white)
    - 3 (green)
  - input_sections:
      - description: four blue/white rows
        colors: [1,0]
        start_row: 0
        end_row: 3
      - description: one yellow row
        colors: [4]
        start_row: 4
        end_row: 4
      - description: one red row
        colors: [2]
        start_row: 5
        end_row: 5
      - description: three red/white rows
        colors: [2, 0]
        start_row: 6
        end_row: 8
  - spatial_relationship: |
      The output grid seems to represent a condensed version of the top 4 rows
      of the input grid.
  - object_interaction: |
      Non-white and non-zero colors in the top section of the input are replaced by 3 (green) in output.
      Zeros remain zeros.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Focus on the Top Section:** Consider only the first four rows of the input grid.
2.  **Map Colors:**
    *   If a cell in this top section is 0 (white), keep it as 0 (white) in the output.
    *   If a cell in this top section is *not* 0 (i.e., any other color), change it to 3 (green) in the output.
3. **Ignore the rest:** Disregard any rows beyond the fourth row in the input grid. The size of the output is determined by the height of the top section x width.

In essence, the transformation extracts the top four rows, and performs a color mapping where all colors that aren't white are replaced with color 3(green), and whites remain.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
