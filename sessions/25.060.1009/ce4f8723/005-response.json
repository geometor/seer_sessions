            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies a key aspect of the transformation: extracting a portion of the input and recoloring it. However, it makes an incorrect assumption about *which* portion to extract and recolor. The initial code focuses on the top-left 4x4 square. The training results show that this is not always the case. The correct 4x4 section can be located anywhere within the input grid and consists of non-zero pixels. The initial code must be updated to find the correct 4x4 section in the input.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples:** Examine all input/output pairs to identify consistent properties of the transformed section, paying close attention to color, size and contents of all the input and output grids.\n2.  **Identify the correct 4x4 section to extract:** find the source square in the input grid\n3. **Refine color mapping:** the transform color rule might change on further review.\n4.  **Update the natural language program:** Re-describe the transformation based on the refined understanding.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution results implied from prompt):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 9x9, contains a 4x4 block of non-zero pixels in the top-left corner.\n    *   Output: 4x4, all pixels are green (3).\n    *   Result: Success. The initial code correctly handles this case.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 9x9, contains a 4x4 block of non-zero pixels surrounded by zeros.\n    *   Output: 4x4, all pixels are green (3).\n    *   Result: Fail. Initial code extracts the *top-left* 4x4, which contains zeros (white), instead of the non-zero square.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 9x9, contains a 4x4 block of non-zero pixels surrounded by zeros, but not at the top-left.\n    *   Output: 4x4, all pixels are green (3).\n    *   Result: Fail. Similar to Example 2, the code extracts the wrong 4x4 section.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  input:\n    size: 9x9\n    objects:\n      - type: square\n        color: mixed (non-zero)\n        size: 4x4\n        location: top-left\n        content: various non-zero colors\n  output:\n    size: 4x4\n    objects:\n      - type: square\n        color: green\n        size: 4x4\n        content: all pixels are green (3)\n\nexample_2:\n  input:\n    size: 9x9\n    objects:\n      - type: square\n        color: mixed (non-zero)\n        size: 4x4\n        location: center (surrounded by zeros)\n        content: various non-zero values\n  output:\n     size: 4x4\n     objects:\n      - type: square\n        color: green\n        size: 4x4\n        content: all pixels are green\n\nexample_3:\n  input:\n    size: 9x9\n    objects:\n      - type: square\n        color: mixed (non-zero)\n        size: 4x4\n        location: not top-left (surrounded by zeros)\n        content: various non-zero values\n  output:\n    size: 4x4\n    objects:\n      - type: square\n        color: green\n        size: 4x4\n        content: all pixels are green\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find the 4x4 Square:** Locate the 4x4 square within the input grid. This square is identified as a contiguous 4x4 block where all pixels have non-zero (non-white) colors. It may be located anywhere in the input.\n2.  **Extract:** Extract the pixel data within the located 4x4 square.\n3.  **Recolor:** Create a new 4x4 grid. Fill every cell of this new grid with the color green (value 3).\n4. **Output:** the result is the new 4 x 4 grid.\n"
