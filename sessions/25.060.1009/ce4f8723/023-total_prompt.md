Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is divided into four sections based on vertical position: top, 2nd, 3rd, and bottom.
Each is tranformed independently. The top section containing 0 and 1 values is transformed to 3, except where 
there is a solid block of 0, in which case the output is 0. The 2nd section with yellow (4) is entirely transformed
to green (3). The bottom section of red and white is output as green except where white is surrounded by red.
A smaller output grid is then constructed.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
