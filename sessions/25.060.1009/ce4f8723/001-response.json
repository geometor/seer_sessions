The input grids seem to be composed of distinct sections of different colors (blue, white, yellow, red). The output grid consistently uses only two colors: green (3) and white (0). The output grid's dimensions are consistently smaller than the input grid, specifically, it seems to consistently be 4x4. The top section of the input grid is composed of blue (1) and white(0) pixels. The placement of white pixels (0) in the output seems to correspond to the placement of white pixels (0) in the upper section of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

It's the area that has same dimension of output grid.\n2.  **Isolate Relevant Colors:** Within the top section, pay attention to the blue (1) and white (0) pixels.\n3. **Create output_grid**: It has the same dimensions with top section of input grid.\n4.  **Color Transformation:**\n    *   Replace all blue (1) pixels in the input top section with green (3) in the output grid.\n    *   Keep all white (0) pixels in the top section unchanged (white, 0) in the output grid.\n5.  **Ignore Other Sections:** Disregard the rest of the input grid (yellow, red sections).\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts the \"pattern\" of 0s and 1s from the top part of the input, replaces 1 with 3, and creates a 4x4 output.\n"
