The input grid contains various colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to consist primarily of green (3) and white (0). There appears to be some relationship between the non-zero, non-white colored blocks in the input, and areas of green in the output. There's a reduction in dimensions, suggesting a summarizing or downscaling operation. The input has distinct horizontal sections of different colors.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
