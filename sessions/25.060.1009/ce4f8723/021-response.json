The input grid appears to have distinct sections or objects of different colors (blue, yellow, red, and white). The output grid seems to consolidate or summarize the input grid, with a strong prevalence of a single color (green) and some white. The size reduction is also notable.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

There seems to be a top, 2nd, 3rd and bottom section.\n\n2.  **Top Section Transformation:** The top section that contains only 0 and 1 values is transformed to 3, expect where there is a solid block of 0, in which case the output is 0.\n\n3. **Middle Section Transformation**: The section(2nd) that has only the color yellow(4) is entirely transformed into the color green (3).\n\n4. **Bottom section:**The bottom section is composed of red and white pixels and has an output of green except where the white color is surrounded by red color.\n\n5.  **Output Grid:** Construct a smaller output grid. The dimensions of the output grid appear to be related to distinct contiguous groups of pixels, it could potentially be the top most group.\n\n"
