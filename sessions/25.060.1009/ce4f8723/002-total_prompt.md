**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger input grid into a smaller output grid. The input grids seem to be composed of distinct sections of different colors (blue, white, yellow, red). The output grid consistently uses only two colors: green (3) and white (0). The output grid's dimensions are consistently smaller than the input grid, specifically, it seems to consistently be 4x4. The top section of the input grid is composed of blue (1) and white(0) pixels. The placement of white pixels (0) in the output seems to correspond to the placement of white pixels (0) in the upper section of the input grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [blue, white, yellow, red, green]
      - dimensions: variable
      - sections:
          - top:
              colors: [blue, white]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [green, white]
      - dimensions: [4, 4]

actions:
  - name: copy_and_replace
    description: Copy a section from the input grid, transform and place to the output grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid appears to be a reduced and recolored version of top section input grid. White areas maintained, other colored are replaced.
  - type: color_transformation
    details: blue -> green; white -> white

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Top Section:** Focus on the top section of the input grid. It's the area that has same dimension of output grid.
2.  **Isolate Relevant Colors:** Within the top section, pay attention to the blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
3. **Create output_grid**: It has the same dimensions with top section of input grid.
4.  **Color Transformation:**
    *   Replace all blue (1) pixels in the input top section with green (3) in the output grid.
    *   Keep all white (0) pixels in the top section unchanged (white, 0) in the output grid.
5.  **Ignore Other Sections:** Disregard the rest of the input grid (yellow, red sections).

In essence, the transformation extracts the "pattern" of 0s and 1s from the top part of the input, replaces 1 with 3, and creates a 4x4 output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
