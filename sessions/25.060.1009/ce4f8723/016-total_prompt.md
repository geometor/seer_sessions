**input:**

**output:**
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a simplified or "summarized" version of a section of the input, primarily using just two colors: green (3) and white (0). The input appears to be segmented, with a repeating pattern, and it's a portion of that segment that makes up the output.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is larger than the output grid.
  - observation: Input grid contains multiple colors (0, 1, 2, 4).
  - observation: Output grid contains only two colors (0 and 3).
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      height: 9
      width: 4
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      height: 4
      width: 4
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - relationship: output_grid is a transformation of a subsection of input_grid.
  - action: extract_subsection
    description: A subsection is taken from the input grid.
    parameters:
        start_row: 0
        end_row: 3
        start_col: 0
        end_col: 3
  - action: recolor_subsection
    description: All non-zero values in the subsection are replaced with 3.
  - relationship: color mapping exists for input and output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Subsection:** Extract the top-left 4x4 subsection from the input grid.
2.  **Recolor:** Within this subsection, replace all non-zero color values with the value 3 (green). Leave the 0 (white) values unchanged.
3.  **Output:** The resulting 4x4 grid is the output.

In essence, the transformation extracts the top-left 4x4 portion and recolors any non-white cell to green.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
