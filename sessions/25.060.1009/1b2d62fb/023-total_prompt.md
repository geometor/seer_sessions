Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Central Stripe:** Locate the vertical stripe of blue (color 1) pixels in the input grid. This stripe acts as the primary source of transformation.
2. **Extract column:** Use central column to create new grid
3.  **Resize:** Create a new grid with the same height as the input stripe but a new width, which would be fixed number.
4.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   Change all blue pixels from the original stripe to azure (color 8).
    *   Change all the other pixels to the white (color 0).
5. **Create checkered pattern:** Create 3-wide vertical pattern where color alternates white-azure-azure in a column, but in the next row it is offset and starts azure-white-azure.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
