The input grid appears to have a vertical line of blue (1) pixels and surrounding maroon (9) and white (0) pixels. The output grid is smaller and contains only azure (8) and white (0) pixels. The azure pixels seem to correspond to a compressed representation of the blue line in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

All other colors become white.\n3.  **Compress:** Create an output grid. The output grid is 5 pixels tall, and 3 pixels wide.\n4.  **Draw Segment:** represent the vertical blue line as an azure line on the first row. The segment starts at column 1 and ends at column 2 and makes up the azure line segment.\n5.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill all other cells of the output grid with white (0).\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts the blue vertical line from the input, represents it as azure segment on the top row, and changes every other cell to white while also making the grid thinner.\n"
