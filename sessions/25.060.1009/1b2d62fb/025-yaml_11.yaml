- task: "Determine a checkered pattern based on blue pixel presence."
- objects:
    - input_grid: "A 2D array of integers representing pixel colors."
    - output_grid: "A 2D array with a fixed width of 3, representing a checkered pattern."
    - blue_pixel: "A pixel with a value of 1."
    - azure_pixel: "A pixel with a value of 8."
    - white_pixel: "A pixel with value of 0"
- properties:
    - input_height: "Variable, determined by the input grid's shape."
    - output_height: "Same as the input height."
    - output_width: "Fixed at 3."
    - blue_row: "The row index containing a blue pixel."
    - pattern: "Checkered, alternating between white and azure."
- actions:
    - identify: "Locate the row containing a blue pixel in the input grid."
    - generate: "Create an output grid with a fixed width of 3."
    - populate: "Fill the output grid rows based on the presence and position of the blue pixel."
    - alternate: "If blue is present, create checkered pattern for the given row using 0s and 8s."
