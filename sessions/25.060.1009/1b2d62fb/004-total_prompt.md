**input:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a grid of colored pixels, predominantly white, maroon, and blue.  The output is a smaller grid, mostly white with two azure pixels. The input has a distinct vertical blue stripe in the center. The output seems to correspond to a condensed, lower portion of the blue stripe, changed to azure. The spatial relationship between the blue stripe in the input and the azure pixels in the output is key. The width and height of the input and output grids are different.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x7
    colors: [white, maroon, blue]
    description: Contains a central vertical stripe of blue pixels.
  - object: blue_stripe
    type: object
    color: blue
    shape: vertical stripe
    location: center column of input_grid
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x3
    colors: [white, azure]
    description: Contains two horizontally adjacent azure pixels.
  - object: azure_pixels
    type: object
    color: azure
    shape: single pixel
    count: 2
    location: row 4 of output_grid, adjacent horizontally.
  - relation: spatial_correspondence
    description: The azure pixels in the output correspond to the bottom part of the blue stripe in the input, with a color change.
  - action: color_change
      source: blue
      target: azure
  - action: size_reduction
      type: height
      source_object: blue_stripe
      target_object: azure_pixels

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the central, vertical blue stripe** in the input grid.
2.  **Extract** or select only two pixels from the bottom of input blue stripe.
3.  **Change** the color of the selected blue pixels to azure.
4.  **Create** an output grid using only white (0's) and two adjacent pixels of color azure.
5. The azure pixels in the output grid represent the selected pixels of the input, with color changed.

In essence, the transformation isolates the bottom part of the central blue stripe in the input, changes its color, and places it in new grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
