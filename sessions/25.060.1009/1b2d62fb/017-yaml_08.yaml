  observations:
    - object_types:
        - grid: Input and output grids are present.
        - row: each grid have rows of pixels
    - properties:
        - input_grid_shape: Input grids have varying shapes (e.g., 13x25, 10x28, 7x23).
        - output_grid_shape: Output grid has the same shape as input grid
        - colors: Input grids contain colors 0 (white), 1 (blue), and 5 (gray).
        - output_colors: Output grids contain colors 0 (white) and 8 (azure).
