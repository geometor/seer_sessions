**input:**
```

**output:**
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another, smaller grid of colored pixels. The colors in the input seem to be predominantly white, maroon, and blue. The output grid is smaller and contains only white and azure pixels. The blue pixels in the input seem to play a key role in determining the structure and azure pixels of the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: 5x7
        colors: [white, maroon, blue]
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: 5x3
        colors: [white, azure]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          input: [white, maroon, blue]
          output: [white, azure]
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: Converts the input grid to the output grid.
    details: >
      The transformation focuses on the blue column in the input grid.
      The width of the output matches with number of columns having same colors on either side of central blue column.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid appears to be a compressed or abstracted version of the input grid, specifically around central blue colored column.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the central blue column:** Locate the column in the input grid that contains only blue (value 1) pixels.
2.  **Determine output grid width:** The width of output grid would be number of columns in input grid having same colored pixels on either side of the central blue column, plus one for central column itself.
3.  **Construct output grid:** create a new grid that is the same height as the input grid, and calculated width in step 2.
4.   **Populate the output grid**: Fill all cells in the output grid with white (0). Replace the white at the locations in the output grid corresponding to blue column in the input grid with azure (8).

In simpler terms the output grid copies the central column as azure, and all other cells are white. The width is decided by the number of columns in the input grid with matching colors on either side of central blue column.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
