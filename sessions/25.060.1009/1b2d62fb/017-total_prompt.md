Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Identify the central blue column:** Locate the column in the input grid that contains only blue (value 1) pixels.
2.  **Determine output grid width:** The width of output grid would be number of columns in input grid having same colored pixels on either side of the central blue column, plus one for central column itself.
3.  **Construct output grid:** create a new grid that is the same height as the input grid, and calculated width in step 2.
4.   **Populate the output grid**: Fill all cells in the output grid with white (0). Replace the white at the locations in the output grid corresponding to blue column in the input grid with azure (8).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
