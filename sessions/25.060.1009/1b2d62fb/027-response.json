The input grid seems to have a prominent vertical blue stripe (color 1) in the center.  The output grid is smaller than the input grid and seems to focus on a specific region of the input grid. The colors in the output grid are mostly white (0), with two azure (8) pixels appearing where the blue stripe was located in the input. The output seems to be a 3x5 crop of the input and the colors are transformed, 1->8 and every other color to 0.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
