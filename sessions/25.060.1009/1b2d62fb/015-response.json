The colors in the input seem to be predominantly white, maroon, and blue. The output grid is smaller and contains only white and azure pixels. The blue pixels in the input seem to play a key role in determining the structure and azure pixels of the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Replace the white at the locations in the output grid corresponding to blue column in the input grid with azure (8).\n\nIn simpler terms the output grid copies the central column as azure, and all other cells are white. The width is decided by the number of columns in the input grid with matching colors on either side of central blue column.\n"
