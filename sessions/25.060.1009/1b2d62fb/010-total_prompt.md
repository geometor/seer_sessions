**input:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into another grid. The input grid appears to have a vertical line of blue (1) pixels and surrounding maroon (9) and white (0) pixels. The output grid is smaller and contains only azure (8) and white (0) pixels. The azure pixels seem to correspond to a compressed representation of the blue line in the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1, 9] # White, Blue, Maroon
      - shape: 5x7
      - features:
        - type: vertical_line
          color: 1 # Blue
          column: 3
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 8] # White, Azure
      - shape: 5x3
      - features:
        - type: segment
          color: 8 # Azure
          start_row: 0
          end_row: 0
          start_col: 1
          end_col: 2
  - transformation:
      type: compression
      description: The input grid's blue vertical line is represented by an azure segment in the output grid.
      mapping:
        - input_color: 1 # Blue
          output_color: 8 # Azure
        - input_color: 0
          output_color: 0
        - input_color: 9
          output_color: 0
      size_change:
        - input_width: 7
          output_width: 3
        - input_height: 5
          output_height: 5

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the blue (1) vertical line:** Locate the contiguous vertical line of blue pixels in the input grid.
2. **Translate Color:** In the output, change the color of blue to azure. All other colors become white.
3.  **Compress:** Create an output grid. The output grid is 5 pixels tall, and 3 pixels wide.
4.  **Draw Segment:** represent the vertical blue line as an azure line on the first row. The segment starts at column 1 and ends at column 2 and makes up the azure line segment.
5.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill all other cells of the output grid with white (0).

Essentially, the transformation extracts the blue vertical line from the input, represents it as azure segment on the top row, and changes every other cell to white while also making the grid thinner.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
