largest_object_rule:
  description: The output grid replicates the largest contiguous object found in the input grid, matching its shape and color.  If multiple objects have the same largest size, the behavior is implicitly defined by the `max` function with a `key`, which likely picks the first encountered.
  confirmed_by: All examples.
