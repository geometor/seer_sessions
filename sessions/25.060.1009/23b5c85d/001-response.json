Here's my analysis:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves identifying and extracting a specific colored object within a larger grid. The input grids contain multiple rectangular objects of different colors, often surrounded by or adjacent to background pixels (color 0, white). The output grid consistently represents a single, isolated instance of one of these colored rectangles, and *not* the largest. The extracted rectangle's dimensions and color vary across examples, indicating that size and color are likely parameters in the transformation rule. Crucially, there are often multiple objects of different colors, and the target object is *not* the largest, nor is it defined by shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
