Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains multiple colored objects (contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color). The output grid seems to represent a single object extracted from the input, specifically the red (color 2) object. The other objects (green and blue) are discarded. The output grid retains the shape and relative position of the red object within its bounding box.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: red_object
    color: 2  # Red
    type: contiguous_block
    action: extracted
    input_coordinates: [[1,1], [1,2], [2,2], [3,2], [3,3], [4,1], [4,2], [4,3]]
    output_coordinates: [[0,0], [0,1], [1,1], [2,1], [2,2], [3,0], [3,1], [3,2]]
  - id: green_object
    color: 3  # Green
    type: contiguous_block
    action: discarded
    input_coordinates: [[1,5], [1,6], [2,6]]
  - id: blue_object
    color: 1  # Blue
    type: contiguous_block
    action: discarded
    input_coordinates: [[2, 9], [3, 9], [3, 10], [4, 9], [4, 10]]

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The red object's shape and relative position are preserved in the output.
  - type: selection
    description: Only the red object is selected for output; others are discarded.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color within the input grid.
2.  **Select Target Object:** Select the object with color 2 (red).
3.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the smallest rectangle that contains the entirety of the red object. The top-left coordinate will determine the output size, starting from 0,0.
4. **Extract and Transform:** Create a new grid (the output grid) with dimensions relative to the target object. Copy only the red object's pixels to the output grid, maintaining their relative positions. This is, in essence, cropping and extracting the sub-grid defined by the object
5.  **Discard Other Objects:** Ignore all objects that are not red.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
