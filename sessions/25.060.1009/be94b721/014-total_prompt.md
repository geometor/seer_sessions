Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify the Target Object: In the input grid, locate the horizontal line composed of yellow (4) pixels.
2. Isolate Target Object: Disregard all other objects/colors in the input. Focus solely on the identified yellow line.
3. Bounding Box: find the minimum size of the isolated object, specifically looking for horizontal lines.
4. Create output using the dimensions of the bounding box and fill with the target object's color.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_object(grid, color):
    # Find coordinates of all pixels of the specified color.
    coords = np.argwhere(grid == color)
    return coords

def is_horizontal_line(coords):
    # Check if a set of coordinates forms a horizontal line.
    if len(coords) == 0:
        return False
    rows = coords[:, 0]
    return np.all(rows == rows[0])

    # Calculate the bounding box of the yellow object.
    min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col = bounding_box(yellow_coords)

    # compute height and width
    height = max_row - min_row + 1
    width = max_col - min_col + 1

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code focused on identifying and extracting horizontal yellow lines. This approach worked for the first example, but failed on others. The core issue is that the code is too specific: it only works for *horizontal* yellow lines and doesn't consider other shapes or colors. The other examples show that the target object might be of different shapes (not just a horizontal line) and of a different color. It seems like the transformation rule may not involve finding a bounding box in all cases, in the second training pair the output is an extraction of an object in the input.

My strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze each example pair**: Carefully examine the input and output grids, noting the objects present, their colors, and how they change.
2.  **Identify common patterns**: Look for consistent rules that apply across multiple examples.
3.  **Generalize the natural language program**: Instead of hardcoding "horizontal yellow line," describe the transformation in more general terms, focusing on object properties (like color, shape being a single object) and their relationship to the output.
4.  **Prioritize single object extraction**: The second example makes it appear that there will only ever be one object of consequence.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

I'll use code execution to get precise details about the grids.

import numpy as np

def analyze_grid(grid):
    grid = np.array(grid)
    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)
    shapes = {}
    for color in unique_colors:
        coords = np.argwhere(grid == color)
        if len(coords) > 0:
            min_row, max_row = np.min(coords[:, 0]), np.max(coords[:, 0])
            min_col, max_col = np.min(coords[:, 1]), np.max(coords[:, 1])
            height = max_row - min_row + 1
            width = max_col - min_col + 1
            shapes[color] = (height, width)
    return {
        'unique_colors': unique_colors.tolist(),
        'shapes': shapes
    }

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
