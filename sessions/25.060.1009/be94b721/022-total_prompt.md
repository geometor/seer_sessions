Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various colored pixels, while the output grid seems to focus on a specific color (red, represented by the number 2) and its surrounding context. The other colors in the input grid seem to be irrelevant to the output. The output grid is a 3x3, while the input is a 7x9.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x9
      - colors: [0, 2, 7, 8]  # white, red, orange, azure
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - colors: [0, 2] # white, red
  - type: object
    description: red_region
    properties:
    - color: 2 # red
actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: Extract a subgrid focused on the red region.
relationships:
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid.
  - The output grid focuses on the location of the red (2) color in the input grid and shows a reduced view.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Color:** Find all pixels of color 2 (red) in the input grid.

2.  **Locate Target Area:** We are only interested in the right most block of red.

3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract a 3x3 subgrid from the input grid, centered around the right-most and vertically middle red pixel from the target area found previously. If the centering would extend beyond input boundaries, include only the region within the original boundary

4. return the subgrid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
