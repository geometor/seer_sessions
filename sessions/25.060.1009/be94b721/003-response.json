The input grid contains multiple colored objects (contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color). The output grid seems to represent a single object extracted from the input, specifically the red (color 2) object. The other objects (green and blue) are discarded. The output grid retains the shape and relative position of the red object within its bounding box.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The top-left coordinate will determine the output size, starting from 0,0.\n4. **Extract and Transform:** Create a new grid (the output grid) with dimensions relative to the target object. Copy only the red object's pixels to the output grid, maintaining their relative positions.
