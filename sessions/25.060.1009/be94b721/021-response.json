The input grid contains various colored pixels, while the output grid seems to focus on a specific color (red, represented by the number 2) and its surrounding context. The other colors in the input grid seem to be irrelevant to the output. The output grid is a 3x3, while the input is a 7x9.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
