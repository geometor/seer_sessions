The input grid contains distinct colored regions (objects), while the output grid seems to focus on a single, specific color/object from the input. The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid. The other colored objects other than the object of interest in the input seem irrelevant.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
