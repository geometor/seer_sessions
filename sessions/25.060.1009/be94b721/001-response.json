The transformation seems to focus on extracting a specific colored object from the input grid and presenting it as the output grid, with the rest of the grid converted to 0. The extracted shapes are always solid rectangles and have the largest area compared to other colored object in the image.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
