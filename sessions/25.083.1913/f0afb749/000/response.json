The input grids seem to contain a single, small object, a single pixel of a non-zero color, and the rest are zero (white). The position of this colored pixel varies in each input example. The output grid is significantly larger and always features two distinct patterns. It seems the non-zero colored pixel expands to create a 2 x 2 filled square. It looks like new blue objects arranged in a diagonal cross are created.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1. **Double Dimensions:**  Create a new output grid. The output grid's height is twice the input grid's height, and its width is twice the input grid's width.\n\n2. **Expand colored pixel:** Locate the single non-zero pixel in the input grid. In the output grid, create a 2x2 square of the same color. The top-left corner of this square is determined by mapping the row and col index of the non-zero pixel in the input grid and multiplying them by two. The output grid uses same row and col index as the top-left index.\n\n3. **Create Diagonal Cross:** Create two diagonal lines of blue (color 1) pixels within the output grid. One line extends from the top-left corner (0,0) to the bottom-right corner (height-1, width-1). The other diagonal line extends from the top-right corner (0, width-1) to the bottom-left corner (height-1, 0).\n\nThe core transformation rule is to replicate the input pixel as a 2x2 square with the same color and superimpose a cross, or an X, of blue (1) pixels across the entire output grid, and to double the size of the original grid to create a new output grid.\n"
