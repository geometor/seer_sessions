observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - shape: variable (height, width)
    actions:
      - doubled in size to create output_grid

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - shape: (2 * input_height, 2 * input_width)
    actions:
      - initialized with zeros
      - non-zero pixels from input_grid replicated as 2x2 blocks

  - object: blue_cross
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape: cross (+)
      - location: centered within the output_grid and corresponds original input grid locations
    actions:
       - drawn on the output_grid after 2x2 block replication
