facts:
  - observation: The output grid is always 9x9.
  - observation: The input grid's non-zero pixels determine the color of the output pixels.
  - observation: The input grid's dimensions vary.
  - observation:  The output grid seems to be generated based on a pattern involving the corners and potentially midpoints, mapping onto the 9x9 grid. The relationship of colored input cell (r, c) to output cells appears to follow this pattern:  Input corner colored cells are mapped to every other cell on the edges.  Interior cells are expanded similarly.
  - observation: The previous code's mirroring logic is incorrect. It mirrors based upon the input, when expansion and mirroring of input positions on the 9 x 9 grid is required.
  - rule: Input pixel locations (r_in, c_in) are transformed and mapped to multiple output locations.
