The transformation replicates a two-row pattern: an "original" row and a "duplicated" row, throughout the entire grid.

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros.
2.  **Pattern Repetition:** The transformation follows a repeating two-row pattern: an "original" row and a "duplicated" row.
3.  **Original Row:** Copy the contents of the input row directly to the corresponding output row.
4.  **Duplicated Row:**
    *   For each non-zero pixel in the *corresponding original row* of the input grid:
        *   Let `x` be the column index of the non-zero pixel in the original row.
        *   Let `color` be the value (color) of the non-zero pixel.
        *   Place `color` at `(current_row, 2 * x)` and `(current_row, 2 * x + 1)` in the output grid.
5.  **Iteration:** Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the entire height of the grid, creating the alternating pattern of original and duplicated rows. The "original row" index is calculated as `y // 2` from the input grid.
