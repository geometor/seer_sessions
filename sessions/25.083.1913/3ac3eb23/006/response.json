            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While it correctly identified the idea of replicating and modifying rows, it failed to accurately capture the \"duplication\" logic, specifically where and how the colors from the \"original\" row are placed in the \"duplicated\" row. The results show a consistent pattern of errors related to the incorrect placement of colors in the even-numbered rows. The strategy for resolving the problem must focus on adjusting the logic governing the placement in the \"duplicated\" rows. It seems every non-zero color in a row is duplicated to two color, but the positions are calculated in an erroneous way.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the \"Duplication\" Rule:** Carefully analyze the provided input/output pairs, paying very close attention to the relationship between the positions of non-zero pixels in the original rows and the resulting pixels in the duplicated rows.\n2.  **Precise Positional Mapping:** Determine the exact mathematical formula that maps the column index of a non-zero pixel in the original row to the column indices of the corresponding pixels in the duplicated row.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to clearly and unambiguously describe the corrected transformation rule, including the precise positional mapping.\n4.  **Update Code:** Modify the Python code to reflect the refined natural language program.\n5.  **Re-test and Iterate:** Test the updated code against all training examples and repeat the process if necessary.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's get more precise about the nature of the errors. I'll use a small helper function to compare the grids.\n"
