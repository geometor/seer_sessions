facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves replicating a pattern of rows.
  - observation: |
      The pattern consists of an original row followed by a row with duplicated pixels from the original row.
  - object: original_row
    properties:
      - contains: |
          Pixels that may be duplicated. Zero-valued pixels are not duplicated.
  - object: duplicated_row
    properties:
      - contains: |
        Duplicated pixels from the 'original_row'.
      - placement: |
          Each non-zero pixel in 'original_row' creates two adjacent pixels in 'duplicated_row'.
      - rule: |
          If a pixel at (y, x) in 'original_row' is non-zero, then pixels at (y+1, 2x) and (y+1, 2x+1) in 'duplicated_row' will have the same color.

  - pattern: |
      The original and duplicated rows repeat throughout the entire grid.
  - action: duplication
    description: |
      Non-zero pixels in an 'original_row' are copied and placed in the subsequent 'duplicated_row'.
