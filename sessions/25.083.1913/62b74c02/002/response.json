However, it's clear from the test results that the logic is incomplete and makes incorrect assumptions about how colors should propagate. The primary issue is that the code fills the space between non-zero pixels with the *leftmost* non-zero color in that row. This works in some cases, but fails when the intended behavior is to fill with a repeating or mirrored pattern as it seems from the test cases. We need to revise the logic to consider that filling between pixels has dependency on all of the neighbor pixels, not only the left-most.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* provided examples (train and, if available, test) to identify the *true* underlying pattern. Look for how the colors are changing.\n2.  **Identify Objects and Actions:** Look for any objects and how they might relate to each other.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the re-examination, create a more accurate and comprehensive natural language description of the transformation. It MUST account for *all* examples, not just the first one.\n4.  **Prepare for Code Update:** I'll provide a structured YAML representation and a natural language program, which will be the basis for generating improved Python code in the next phase.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using manual inspection, no `tool_code` needed for this simple analysis):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 12)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 12)\n    *   Mismatched Pixels: 8\n    *   Observations: The code incorrectly fills the space between `2` and `3` with color `2`, while it should use colors `3` and `2`. The code also fills to the edges, which is not correct.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 10)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 10)\n    *   Mismatched Pixels: 6\n    *   Observations: Same logic error as in Example 1, incorrect color when filling between colors, and incorrect color when filling to edges.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 14)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 14)\n    *    Mismatched pixels: 9\n    *   Observations: Same logic error as in Example 1, incorrect color when filling between colors, and incorrect color when filling to edges.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
