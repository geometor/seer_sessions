observations:
  - object: "non-zero sequence"
    properties:
      - description: "A contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels within a row."
      - attributes:
          start_index: "Index of the first non-zero pixel."
          end_index: "Index of the last non-zero pixel."
          values: "The pixel values in the sequence."
    behavior: "The sequence is identified and extracted from each row."
  - action: "mirroring"
    properties:
      - description: "The non-zero sequence is mirrored around its center."
      - details:
          centering: "The original sequence is placed in the center of the output row."
          reflection: "Pixels to the left and right of the centered sequence are filled by reflecting the sequence outwards."
          symmetry: "The resulting row exhibits symmetry around the center of the original sequence."
