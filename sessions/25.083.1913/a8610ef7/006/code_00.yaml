    description: Transforms the input grid into the output grid.
    steps:
      - Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
      - Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
      - If a pixel is white (0), keep its value in the output grid.
      - If a pixel is azure (8):
        - Maintain a global counter for azure pixels.
        - If the counter is even, replace the pixel with red (2).
        - If the counter is odd, replace the pixel with gray (5).
        - Increment the counter.
