"""
1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid identical to the input grid.
2.  **Pixel Iteration:** Iterate through each pixel of the input grid, row by row and column by column.
3.  **White Preservation:** If the current pixel value is '0' (white), keep its value unchanged in the output grid.
4.  **Azure Transformation:** If the current pixel value is '8' (azure):
    *   Determine the starting color for the alternating sequence based on whether the row index is even or odd. If row is even, start the alternation with 2. if the row is odd start with 5.
    *   If the row index is even, and it's the first '8' encountered in this row, replace it with '2' (red); the next 8 with 5, then 2 and so on.
    *    If the row index is odd, and it's the first '8' encountered in this row, replace it with '5' (gray), then with 2, then 5, and so on.
5.  **Output:** Return the modified output grid.

Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the natural language program and the corresponding code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on observing a single training example. While it correctly identified the basic principle of alternating colors (red and gray) for azure pixels, it failed to generalize the rule across all rows and columns. The primary issue is the inconsistent alternation pattern and the incorrect starting color in alternating rows. The program needs to accurately capture the row-wise and count of 8 based color alternation.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Alternation Logic:** The current logic alternates colors based on even/odd rows but gets wrong result. Need to fix the starting color based on the row index and maintain a separate counter for azure (`8`) pixels *within each row*.
2.  **Verify with all Examples:** Ensure the revised logic holds true for *all* provided training examples.
3. **Document everything in YMAL**

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's use a simple manual analysis of the provided outputs and their differences:

**Example 1:**

*   **Issue:** Inconsistent alternation starting colors on each row. Row 0 starts correct, row 1 incorrectly starts with Gray (5).
*    Pixels off, Row 0: 1, Row 1: 5. Row 2: 3. ...

**Example 2:**

*   **Issue:** Similar to example 1, starting colors are not consistent, and the alternation within rows is incorrect in some places.
*    Pixels off, row 1: 3. Row 2: 2. Row 3: 0. Row 5: 0

**Example 3:**

*   **Issue:** The alternation pattern is not consistent, especially concerning starting colors in different rows.
*    Pixels off, row 0: 2, row 1: 1, row 3: 1, row 4: 1, row 5: 1

**Example 4:**

*    Issue: Same issues as above, starting colors on some rows.
*   Pixels off, Row 0: 2. Row 1: 1. Row 3: 1. Row 4: 2. Row 5: 1

**YAML Fact Representation:**


```yaml
task: color_alternation
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      cells:
        - value: 0 # White
          action: preserve
        - value: 8 # Azure
          action: alternate_color
          alternation_pattern:
            - row_even:
                start_color: 2 # Red
                sequence: [2, 5]
            - row_odd:
                start_color: 5 # Gray
                sequence: [5, 2]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  **Row-wise Iteration:** Process each row of the input grid independently.
3.  **Pixel Examination:** For each pixel in the current row:
    *   If the pixel is white (0), keep its value unchanged in the output grid.
    *   If the pixel is azure (8):
        *   Maintain a counter for azure pixels encountered in the *current row*.
        *   If the current row index is even:
            *   If the azure pixel count is even, replace it with red (2).
            *   If the azure pixel count is odd, replace it with gray (5).
        *   If the current row index is odd:
            *   If the azure pixel count is even, replace it with gray (5).
            *   If the azure pixel count is odd, replace it with red (2).
        *   Increment the azure pixel counter for the current row.
4.  **Output:** Return the transformed output grid.
