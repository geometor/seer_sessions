Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The input and output grids have the same dimensions in all the provided examples. The transformation seems to consistently replace '8' (azure) with either '2' (red) or '5' (gray) while leaving '0' (white) unchanged. The choice between '2' and '5' appears to be context-dependent, suggesting a spatial or pattern-based rule, not a simple one-to-one substitution.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [6x6] # All examples are 6x6
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        0: white
        8: azure
        2: red
        5: gray

actions:
  - type: substitution
    description: Replace '8' with either '2' or '5' based on context.
  - type: preservation
    description: '0' remains unchanged.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The choice between '2' and '5' depends on the surrounding pixels or a larger pattern.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Preserve '0'**: If the pixel value is '0' (white), keep it unchanged in the output grid.
3.  **Conditional Substitution**: If the pixel value is '8' (azure), replace it based on the following rule:
      - Check if '8' is part of the left half or right half of each row.
      - If the '8' pixel is in the left half, replace it with '2'(red).
      - If the '8' pixel is in the right half, replace it with '5'(gray).
4. **Output**: produce result.

Essentially, the input grid appears to partitioned horizontally - with the transformation rule changing based on which partition the current input value is within.
