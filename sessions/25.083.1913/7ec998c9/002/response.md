Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a very limited understanding, only considering the propagation of '1's from the left and top edges. It failed to capture the core logic, which involves identifying a non-'1' pixel and using it as a pivot point for a "flood fill" of '1's. The code also incorrectly handles edge cases and propagation boundaries. The strategy to resolve the errors involves fully embracing a flood-fill approach from the boundary until a non-one cell, and correctly identifying the boundaries and regions for '1' propagation based on where the first non-one pixel is.

**Gather Metrics (using manual inspection since tools are not applicable here for high-level reasoning):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (8, 8)
    *   Output Shape: (8, 8)
    *   Non-'1' Pixel: (3, 2), value = 9
    *   Observed Behavior: '1's propagate from edges until blocked, then a diagonal pattern of 1's seem to connect a boundary region.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Output Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Non-'1' Pixel: (2, 2), value = 8
    *   Observed Behavior: Similar edge propagation, stopping at the non-'1' pixel and forming a block.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)
    *   Output Shape: (7, 7)
    *   Non-'1' Pixel: (3, 4), value = 4
    *   Observed Behavior: Similar edge propagation, stopping at the non-'1' pixel, with additional diagonals and the pivot.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - shape: variable dimensions
  - name: non_one_pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer != 1
      - position: row and column index within the grid

actions:
  - name: flood_fill
    description: Propagate the value '1' from edges.
    parameters:
      - start_position: edge of grid
      - stop_condition: encountering a non-'1' pixel
    constraints:
      - fill_direction: towards the Non-1 Pixel in straight orthogonal lines.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the "Pivot"**: Find the first occurrence of a non-'1' pixel in the input grid, scanning from top-left. This is the "pivot" pixel.
2.  **Edge Propagation (Horizontal and Vertical)**:
    *   From the top edge, propagate '1's downwards in each column until a non-'1' pixel or the bottom edge is reached.
    *   From the left edge, propagate '1's rightwards in each row until a non-'1' pixel or the right edge is reached.
3.  **Pivot Fill:** Starting from the top-left pixel and moving until the right-bottom pixel. If there are no non-one pixels the grid is filled with 1, otherwise:
    *   Fill the top row and left column with 1, stopping at the non-one pixel.
    *   For all columns to the left of the non-one pixel: propagate 1 downward until the bottom
    *   For all rows above the non-one pixel: propagate 1 rightward until the edge.
4. **Diagonal Fill**. Connect all non-1 pixels to the boundary with a "beam" or diagonal of 1's.

This refined program accounts for the "pivot" pixel and the bounded propagation of '1's, creating a more accurate description of the transformation.
