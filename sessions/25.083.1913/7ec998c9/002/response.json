            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a very limited understanding, only considering the propagation of '1's from the left and top edges. It failed to capture the core logic, which involves identifying a non-'1' pixel and using it as a pivot point for a \"flood fill\" of '1's. The code also incorrectly handles edge cases and propagation boundaries. The strategy to resolve the errors involves fully embracing a flood-fill approach from the boundary until a non-one cell, and correctly identifying the boundaries and regions for '1' propagation based on where the first non-one pixel is.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using manual inspection since tools are not applicable here for high-level reasoning):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (8, 8)\n    *   Output Shape: (8, 8)\n    *   Non-'1' Pixel: (3, 2), value = 9\n    *   Observed Behavior: '1's propagate from edges until blocked, then a diagonal pattern of 1's seem to connect a boundary region.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Non-'1' Pixel: (2, 2), value = 8\n    *   Observed Behavior: Similar edge propagation, stopping at the non-'1' pixel and forming a block.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (7, 7)\n    *   Non-'1' Pixel: (3, 4), value = 4\n    *   Observed Behavior: Similar edge propagation, stopping at the non-'1' pixel, with additional diagonals and the pivot.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If there are no non-one pixels the grid is filled with 1, otherwise:\n    *   Fill the top row and left column with 1, stopping at the non-one pixel.\n    *   For all columns to the left of the non-one pixel: propagate 1 downward until the bottom\n    *   For all rows above the non-one pixel: propagate 1 rightward until the edge.\n4. **Diagonal Fill**. Connect all non-1 pixels to the boundary with a \"beam\" or diagonal of 1's.\n\nThis refined program accounts for the \"pivot\" pixel and the bounded propagation of '1's, creating a more accurate description of the transformation.\n"
