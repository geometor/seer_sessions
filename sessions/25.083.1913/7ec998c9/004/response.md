Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a very limited understanding, focusing on a "pivot" and simple propagation. It's clear from the results that this approach is insufficient. The code fails to capture the core concept of connecting regions of '1's to the edges and using non-'1' pixels as boundaries. The propagation logic is too simplistic and doesn't handle the "filling" aspect correctly. The strategy needs to shift from a pivot-centric approach to a region-filling approach, bounded by non-'1' pixels and connected to the edges.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* provided examples, paying close attention to how the '1's are distributed in the output relative to their position in the input and the location of other colors. Look for a more general rule. Discard the "pivot" concept.
2.  **Identify Core Logic:** The correct logic seems to be a type of "flood fill" with '1's, starting from the edges, but *stopping* when it encounters any other color (or another edge). The non-'1' pixels define the *shape* of the filled area.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect this "flood fill from edges, bounded by other colors" logic.
4.  **Develop a Plan:** Outline the general steps as to how the natural language program will be converted into a python function.

**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis, as code execution isn't directly applicable here):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Mostly '4's, with a single '9' in the middle.
    *   Output: '1's fill the top-left and bottom-right corners, bounded by the '9' and the connected '4's.
    *   Code Output: Fails to propagate the '1's at all.
    *   Key Observation: The '9' acts as a barrier. '1's connect to edges.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Mostly '7's, with a single '8' in the middle.
    *   Output: '1's fill the top-left and part of bottom-left near edges.
    *   Code Output: Fails to propagate the '1's.
    *   Key Observation: The '8' acts as a barrier. '1's connect to edges.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Mostly '2's, with a single '4' on the right.
    *   Output: '1's propagate from the top, bottom, and left, stopping at the '4' and forming connected regions.
    *   Code Output: No '1' filling
    *   Key Observation: '4' defines the right boundary. The '1's fill in the gaps, but only if connected to the edge.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Flood Fill (Top to Bottom):** For each column, start from the top cell and change any '1' to '1'(no change). If you hit edge or other than '1', stop the current path, begin the next path from the next row of current column.
3.  **Flood Fill (Left to Right):** For each row, start from the left and change any '1' to '1'(no change). If you hit edge or other than '1', stop the current path, begin the next path from the next column of current row.
4. The final rules were too complex for the provided examples.

**Plan**
The described algorithm is a standard flood fill, and is not complicated to implement. Numpy's ability to handle 2d arrays make this task easier, since it can work with rows and columns directly.
