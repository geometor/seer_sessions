facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have identical dimensions."
  - observation: "Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color."
  - observation: "The digit '1' (blue) is introduced in the output grid."
  - observation: "Digits other than '1' in the input grid retain their original positions in the output grid."
  - observation: "The placement of '1's appears to be related to the grid boundaries, and the location of a single non-1 digit."
  - relationship: "'1's spread from edges meeting the condition, stopping at original other digit"
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: "M x N (variable)"
      - content: "Single-digit integers (0-9)"
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: "M x N (same as input)"
      - content: "Single-digit integers (0-9), including newly introduced '1's"
  - action: "Introduce '1's based on a rule involving edges of the grid, and location of a single non-1 digit."
