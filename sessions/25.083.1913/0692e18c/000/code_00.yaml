    description: >
      Replicated copies of the input grid are repositioned and potentially
      mirrored. One copy is placed in the top-left 3x3 section, another one, flipped
      horizontally is placed at top-right, and one, flipped vertically, at the bottom-left
      section. A completely mirrored (both horizontal and vertical) copy is placed at the
      center of the grid.

    to: output_grid
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid through replication, reposition and mirroring.
