    properties:
      shape: (1, 9) # Consistent across all examples
      colors: derived from input_grid

  - action: row_combination
    description: Every two rows of the input grid, starting from the second row (index 1), are combined.
    details: The elements of every other row is added to the output.
    result: intermediate_grid

  - action: select_rows
    description:  Select rows from the input for combination, discard top and bottom row
    details: if input is n_rows, select range(1, n_rows-1, 2)

  - action: generate_output
    description: the combined rows are formed into the output grid, one row per two input rows

transformation_rule: |
    The transformation takes a 9x9 input grid and produces a 1x9 output grid. 
    The output grid consists of a single row made of selected rows from the input.
