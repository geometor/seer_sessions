            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the errors, and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were based on observations from the *first* training example only. This is insufficient. The errors encountered when running the code on the subsequent examples highlight the need to generalize the transformation rule. The \"index out of bounds\" errors specifically point to a mismatch between the assumed output grid dimensions and the actual dimensions required by the transformation logic, especially when handling stripes and their placement. It seems the logic of reversing \"combined stripes\" is creating the out of bounds issue.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Gather Information:** I need to examine *all* provided training examples (input and output grids) to understand the core transformation logic. I'll focus on identifying:\n    *   How the output grid dimensions relate to the input grid dimensions.\n    *   The consistent operations performed on objects (stripes, colors, positions).\n    *   The role of mirroring, reversing, and combination. Are these consistent?\n    * The first error occurs processing `col_idx=7`, need to determine what is happening at this stage\n2.  **Analyze Errors:** The \"index out of bounds\" error provides a crucial clue. It indicates that the code is trying to access a column index that doesn't exist in the `output_grid`.\n3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis of all examples, I'll create a revised, more general natural language program that describes the transformation rule accurately.\n4.  **Adapt Code:** The updated natural language program should then be documented by updating the python code.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Example Analysis (using code execution):**\n\nI'll use `tool_code` to get the dimensions of the input and output grids for each example and to inspect the intermediate results to understand when and how the errors are happening.\n\n"
