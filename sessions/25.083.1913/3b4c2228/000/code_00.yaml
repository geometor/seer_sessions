facts:
  - object_types:
      - grid: "The overall input and output structure."
      - pixel: "An individual cell within the grid, represented by a digit (color)."
      - object: "A contiguous block of pixels of the same color."
  - properties:
      - grid_dimensions: [height, width] # of the input grid
      - output_grid_dimensions: [3, 3] # Output grid is always 3x3.
      - colors: "A range of colors (0-9) with specific RGB values (as defined in the problem statement)."
      - object_color: "The color of a given object."
  - actions:
      - count_distinct_objects: "Count the number of unique objects (contiguos colored regions)"
  - relationships:
    -  input_output_size_difference: "Input grid dimensions are variable, output grid dimension is fixed."
    -  color_to_binary: "The input has multiple colors that appear to be mapped to binary values (0 or 1) in the output."
  - observations:
      - train_1: Input contains 2 distinct objects of green and red colors. Output has a single '1' in the top-left corner.
      - train_2: Input contains 3 distinct objects. Output contains two 1's.
      - train_3: Input contains 3 distinct objects. Output contains a single '1' in the top-left corner.
      - train_4: Input contains 3 distinct objects. Output contains three 1's, diagonally from top-left.
      - train_5: Input contains multiple objects. Output contains two 1's.
