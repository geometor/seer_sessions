facts:
  - task: "Determine output grid based on input grid object properties."
  - input: "Grid of integers representing colors."
  - output: "3x3 grid of integers, primarily 0s with 1s indicating a specific condition."
  - observations:
    - "The output grid is always 3x3, regardless of the input grid size."
    - "The output grid contains mostly 0s, with one or more 1s."
    - "The presence and position of 1s in the output seem related to properties of objects in the input grid, but not simply the number of objects."
    - "Example 4 has three distinct objects (when combining objects 4 and 6) and shows 1 in each position on the diagnal."
  - object_properties:
    - color: "The color of the object (integer value)."
    - bounding_box: "The top-left and bottom-right coordinates of the rectangle containing the object."
    - size: "The number of pixels in the object."
