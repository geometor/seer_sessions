    *   For subsequent 7s found at the input row index, continue by adding 8's and a 7 to the end of the row, such as if we see n 7s in the same row, we will insert n "8"s followed by a 7.

4. **Maintain other pixels:** If no orange pixel exists in any column at the row index, keep the existing output row the same size as the input.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and subsequently the code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on a single example, and it's clear they haven't captured the full complexity of the transformation. The code correctly identifies the orange pixels (7s) and attempts to insert 8s and 7s, but the logic for *where* and *how many* to insert is flawed, as evidenced by the mismatches in both examples. The core issue is that the code does insert enough `8`s before each `7` at each level.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine *where* the transformed outputs differ from the expected outputs. Identify specific rows, columns, and values that are incorrect.
2.  **Refine Counting/Placement Logic:** The current program seems to simply add one 8 per column, regardless if there are multiple 7 in the input row. It must consider not just the *presence* of a 7 in a row but also the number of 7 that needs to be placed in the correct level in the output row.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis, rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the observed transformation rule. Be very specific about the conditions for inserting 8s and 7s.
4. Re-implement based on the new Natural Language Program.

**Metrics and Observations (Example 1):**

*   **Input:** 7x8 grid, five rows with a '7' in the third column, two empty rows.
*   **Expected Output:** The number of 8s decrease and the number of 7 increase at each level.
*   **Transformed Output:** Only a single '8' followed by a single '7' is inserted in each row where a '7' was present in the input, and the rest is zeros.
*   **Mismatch:** The transformed output fails to increase 8s in the first four rows.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      orange_pixels: pixels with value 7

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      values: integers (0-9)
      constructed_rows: rows built based on orange pixel positions in input_grid
      other_rows: same value as input, when there is no orange pixel in that row.

actions:
  - name: locate_orange_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates (row, column) of orange pixels

  - name: construct_output_row
    input: row_index, orange_pixel_rows, orange_pixel_cols, input_columns, output_grid
    output: modified row in output_grid
    logic: |
        For each row in the input grid:
          1. Check for the presence of orange pixels (7).
          2. If orange pixels exist in the input row:
              Insert a '8' and a '7'. The number of '8's before each '7' represents the number of 7 at the same row.
          3. If no orange pixels exist: keep the output row the same.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Orange Pixels:** Find all pixels with the value '7' (orange) in the input grid.
2.  **Process Each Row:** Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  **Conditional Row Construction:**
    *   If a row in the input grid contains one or more orange pixels (7):
        *   Construct a new row for the output grid.
        *   Iterate from n=1 to the number of 7s found at this row in the input
        *   For each n, insert n 8s followed by a 7 into the output.
        *   Fill the remaining spaces of output row to make the row the same with as input.
    *   If a row in the input grid does *not* contain any orange pixels:
        * The output will be the same as the input row

4. **Output Grid:** The result is the output grid, where rows corresponding to those with orange pixels in the input grid are replaced according to the rule above, and other rows remain the same.
