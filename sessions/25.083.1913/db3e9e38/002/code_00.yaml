examples:
  - id: 1
    input:
      shape: (6, 8)
      orange_pixels: [[3, 6], [4, 6], [5, 6]]  # Row, Col
    output:
      shape: (6, 8)
      orange_pixels: [[0, 7], [1, 7], [2, 7], [3, 6], [4, 6], [5, 6]]
      new_pixels: [[0,6], [1,6], [2,6]] #8s
    observations: |
      The output grid maintains the same shape as the input grid.
      For each orange pixel in the input, an "8 7" sequence is prepended to the *column* containing the orange pixel.
      Existing orange pixels are shifted down within their column.
  - id: 2
    input:
      shape: (5, 7)
      orange_pixels: [[3, 5], [4, 5]]
    output:
      shape: (5, 7)
      orange_pixels: [[0, 6], [1, 6], [2, 5], [3, 5]]
      new_pixels: [[0,5],[1,5]] #8s
    observations: |
        The output grid maintains the same shape as the input grid.
        "8 7" sequences added to the *column* of the existing orange pixels.
