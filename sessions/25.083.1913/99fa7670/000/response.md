Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documentation, and a natural language program description:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary element seems to be the manipulation of non-zero colored pixels.  The zero-valued pixels (white) appear to act as a background.  The transformation doesn't seem to involve complex arithmetic or shape recognition. Instead, it appears to focus on extending existing colored pixels. The direction and extent of the expansion are key to figuring out the rule.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - location: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: extend_color
    description: >
      Extends the presence of a non-zero color horizontally and vertically.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: >
        Non-zero pixels are expanded to fill subsequent cells to the right and downwards.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Iterate** through each non-zero pixel in the input grid.
2. For each non-zero pixel found:
    a. **Extend Horizontally:** Change all pixels to the right of the original pixel, within the same row, to match the original pixel's color, until another color is found.
    b. **Extend Vertically:** Change all pixels below the original pixel, within the same column, to match the original pixel's color, until another color is found.
3. Return the modified grid.

Essentially the program "drops" a line of the same color to the bottom and "bleeds" the color to the right of the input grid.
