facts:
  - object_types:
      - grid: "2D array of integers (0-9), representing colored pixels."
      - array: "1D array of integers (0-9), representing colored pixels."
  - input_properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: "variable, between 1x1 and 30x30"
      - colors: "can contain any of the 10 colors (0-9)"
  - output_properties:
      - type: array
      - dimensions: "fixed length of 5 in the given examples"
      - colors: "seemingly derived from the input grid's colors"
  - relationships:
      - input_to_output: "The output array is derived from the input grid through an unknown transformation rule."
  - observations:
      - "The output array's length is consistent (5) across the training examples."
      - "Output colors appear in the input grid."
      -  "The output array has exactly 2 unique colors in all examples."
      -  "One of the output colors is always `1` (blue)"
      - "The other output color is always `0` (white/background)"
      -  "The number of `1`'s in the output array matches the number of connected regions of `1`'s in the inputs"
