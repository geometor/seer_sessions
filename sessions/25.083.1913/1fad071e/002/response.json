            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were on the right track, focusing on identifying connected blue regions and using their count to construct the output. However, the results reveal a consistent error: the output often has more `1`s than it should. This suggests the `find_connected_regions` function is likely correctly identifying the number of distinct blue regions, but output creation is making assumptions about the number of expected 1s. The problem statement is asking for *N* elements of 1, where *N* is the number of blue regions.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Region Counting:** While the problem seems to be in constructing, I'll briefly use code execution to confirm that `find_connected_regions` *is* counting correctly in the failing examples. This is a sanity check.\n2.  **Focus on Output Construction:** The core issue is likely how we populate the output array. It seems likely the error is clamping incorrectly and filling the output with 1s.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Verify Region Counting (Code Execution):**\n\n"
