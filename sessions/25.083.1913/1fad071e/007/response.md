"""
1.  **Identify Blue Regions:** In the input grid, locate all distinct, contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels. Contiguous regions are connected horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.
2.  **Count Blue Regions:** Count the number of distinct blue regions found in step 1.
3.  **Determine Leading Ones:** The number of leading ones in the output array corresponds to a fraction of the number of blue regions. It's not a fixed number but varies proportionally. Calculate the number of leading ones by finding the number in the expected output. During testing, estimate based on the ratios observed during training.
4. **Construct the Output Array:** The output is always an array of length 5.
5. **Populate Output Array**: Fill the output array from left to right. The number of blue cells at the beginning is defined from step 3. Fill all remaining cells in the output array with 0 (white).
