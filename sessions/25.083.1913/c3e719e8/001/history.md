Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input is a small 2D grid (3x3) of single-digit integers, each representing a color.
*   **Output:** The output is a larger 2D grid (9x9) that seems to be composed of multiple copies of the input grid, along with some areas filled with zeros (white color). The input grid appears in multiple locations in the ouput grid.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a replication and arrangement of the input grid within a larger canvas. The specific arrangement seems to include original grid, padding with zeros, and concatenating.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - name: zero_block
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - values: all zeros

actions:
  - name: replicate
    agent: input_grid
    target: output_grid
  - name: pad
    agent: zero_block
    target: output_grid
  - name: concatenate_rows
        description: Appends grid as row
  - name: concatenate_cols
        description: Appends grid as column

relationships:
  - input_grid is contained within output_grid (multiple times)
  - zero_blocks fill space between input_grid instances in output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Create Canvas:** Initialize a 9x9 output grid filled with zeros.
2.  **Replicate and Place Input (Corners):**
    *   Copy the input grid.
    *   Place the copy to top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right 3x3 sections of the 9x9 canvas.
3.  **Pad:** insert zero (white) padding blocks.
4. **Concatenate:**
    * Make 3 copies of the input grid.
    * Concatenate these together as columns to make a 3x9 grid.
    * Concatenate these together as rows to make a 9x3 grid.
    * Concatenate the two grids with padding of zeros to form the 9 x 9 output.

Alternative, and more concise natural language program, given the examples:

1.  **Create:** two intermediate grids.
2.  **Intermediate Grid 1**: Concatenate three copies of the input grid horizontally (side-by-side).
3.  **Intermediate Grid 2**: Concatenate three copies of the input grid vertically (one above the other).
4.  **Create Canvas.** Create a 9x9 canvas of zeros.
5.  **Combine**:
    *   Place Intermediate Grid 1 at the top of the canvas.
    *   Place Intermediate Grid 1 at the bottom of the canvas.
    *   Place Intermediate Grid 2 at the far left of the canvas.
    *    Place Intermediate Grid 2 with a 3-column offset to the right.

This maintains all pixels of the input grid.
