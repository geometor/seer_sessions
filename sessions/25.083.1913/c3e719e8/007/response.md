"""
1.  **Canvas Creation:** Create a 9x9 canvas filled with zeros.

2.  **Input Grid Replication:**  The input grid is replicated nine times in a diamond pattern within the canvas, creating specific offsets between each replicated instance.

3. **Center Input on Output:** Each input grid is positioned by its center pixel.

4.  **Placement Pattern:** The placement of the replicated grids follows a specific diamond pattern. Five are placed such that there is an empty space between the edges:
    *   One instance of the input grid is placed in the very center of the canvas.
    *   Four input grids are placed with their centers 3 spaces away, in the top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right directions.
    *   Four input grids are placed with their centers 3 spaces away in the top center, bottom center, center left and center right directions.
5.  **Zero Padding:** Empty cells in the canvas remain as zeros. This results in a consistent 9x9 output, regardless of the 3x3 input.
