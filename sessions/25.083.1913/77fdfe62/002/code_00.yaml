observations:
  - type: divider
    description: "The input grid is divided into four quadrants by horizontal and vertical lines of color '1' (blue)."
    properties:
      horizontal_line_color: 1
      vertical_line_color: 1

  - type: regions
    description: "The relevant regions are the top-left and bottom-left quadrants formed by the dividers, excluding the divider lines themselves."
    properties:
      top_left: "Contains objects defined by contiguous pixels of the same color, surrounded by '0' (white) or the grid edge."
      bottom_left:  "Contains objects defined by contiguous pixels of the same color, surrounded by '0' (white) or the grid edge."

  - type: objects
    description: "Objects within each region are extracted based on color contiguity."
    properties:
      color: "The color of the pixels forming the object."
      shape: "Determined by the arrangement of pixels."
      location: "Defined by row and column indices within the region."

  - type: output_construction
    description: "The output is formed by combining the extracted objects from the top-left and bottom-left regions. Top Left stacked on top of Bottom Left."
    properties:
        - stacking_order: top_left, bottom_left
        - object_arrangement: "The extracted objects are placed vertically. Objects from the top-left appear above objects from the bottom-left."
