            "text": "Okay, here's an analysis of the results and a plan to improve the natural language program and the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the core concept of blue (1) dividers and extracting colors from the four quadrants. However, it struggles with several key aspects:\n\n1.  **Output Grid Size:** The code initially assumes a 2x2 output, then tries to adjust to 4x4, and then tries to reduce it. It's not reliably determining the correct output size based on the *input* structure and needs to make it dynamic based off examples..\n2.  **Object Representation:** The code correctly extracts the *color* of the object in each quadrant but fails to handle example 2 and 3 properly - there appears to be a relationship to which quadrants are filled.\n3. **Quadrant ordering:** There is an error in the order the quadrants are assigned.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Dynamic Output Grid:** Instead of hardcoding sizes, the output grid size needs to be determined dynamically. We need to analyze the *input* to determine the output shape. The presence of colors other than '1' (blue) and '0' (white) after a divider might indicate additional rows or columns.\n2.  **Improved Quadrant Mapping:** Re-examine how quadrants in the input map to positions in the output. The current mapping is incorrect and not consistent across the examples. There seems to be an issue of transposing and possibly mirroring.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** The current natural language description is too vague about the relationship between input structure and output size/content. It needs to be more precise, incorporating the insights gained from analyzing *all* examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where helpful):**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, noting key observations:\n\n"
