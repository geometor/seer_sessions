facts:
  - task: "Quadrant Extraction and Reshaping"
  - dividers:
    - color: "blue"
    - value: 1
    - description: "Horizontal and vertical lines of blue pixels divide the input grid."
  - regions:
    - description: "The dividers create four regions: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right."
  - objects:
    - definition: "Contiguous pixels of the same color within a region, excluding divider pixels and background (0/white)."
    - property: "Color is the primary characteristic of an object for this task."
  - output_grid:
    - structure: "A grid where each cell represents a region from the input."
    - size: "Determined dynamically by number of cells in each region"
    - population: "Each cell in output contains color of object from a corresponding input region"
  - observations:
      - example_1: "Output is 2x2. Quadrant order is top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right"
      - example_2: "Output is 4x4. Quadrant order appears consistent."
      - example_3: "Output is 4x4, Quadrant order appears consistent."
  - transformations:
    - type: "Object extraction"
    - rule: "The single *color* of the largest object in each region (excluding blue and white) determines the output cell's value."
    - size_variation: "The number of elements in a region seems to correspond to the output grid."
