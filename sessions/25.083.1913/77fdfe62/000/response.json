Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits, representing colors.\n*   The input grids appear to be larger than the output grids.\n*   There's a consistent presence of '1's forming a horizontal and vertical line surrounding other colored areas in the input grid.\n*   The digits/colors in the output grid seem to be a selection of some from the input.\n* There are what look like islands of values surrounded by 0 in both input and output\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Disregard the \"inside\", the middle created by the intersecting 1s.\n\n3.  **Extract Corner objects:** Find the objects in the top left region and bottom left region bordered by 0's\n\n4. **Construct Output**: Take the colors of those two objects and combine, placing the top left object at the top and the bottom left object at the bottom.\n\n5.  **Output Grid**: Output the resulting grid.\n"
