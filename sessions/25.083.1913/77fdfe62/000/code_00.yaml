objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: variable (e.g., 6x6, 8x8)
        elements: digits (0-9) representing colors
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: variable (smaller than input_grid)
        elements: digits (0-9) representing colors
  - type: object
    properties:
      - color_surrounded: a single color or cluster enclosed by color 1 and color 0 in the input_grid.
        selection_criteria:  colors not equal to 0 or 1 and not on the color 1 divider lines
      - output colors: colors present in the output
relationships:
  - input_grid contains multiple color areas.
  - output_grid appears to be constructed of blocks from input_grid.
actions:
  - selection: Colors are selected from the input_grid based on being surrounded by 0s and the divider of 1s.
  - extraction: color blocks on the top and bottom left of the divider lines
  - arrangement: the two extracted color blocks are placed together.
