"""
1.  **Find Dividers:** Identify the horizontal and vertical lines consisting entirely of '1' (blue) pixels within the input grid. These lines act as dividers.
2.  **Define Regions:** Based on the dividers, isolate the top-left and bottom-left quadrants of the grid. Exclude the divider lines themselves.
3.  **Extract Objects:** Within each region (top-left and bottom-left), identify distinct objects. An object is a group of connected pixels of the same color, not including '0' which acts like a background.
4. **Construct Output**: Create the output by taking the objects, represented by their color values and arranging them. Place the complete object of the top-left region, and stack the complete object of the bottom left region below. The output grid's dimensions are determined by the combined shapes of these extracted objects.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of identifying dividers and extracting objects from the top-left and bottom-left regions was partially correct. However, the code fails to accurately reconstruct the output in terms of both dimensions and pixel arrangement. It seems to correctly identify the dividing lines and extract distinct color regions but fails to reposition them appropriately in a 2x2 grid. The core issue is that it just stacks objects from the top-left and then the bottom-left, row by row, without taking into account that columns should be considered as well. The current code ignores the spatial arrangement within the objects, particularly the column indices. It simply concatenates rows, losing crucial spatial information. It also assumes each object has a single column and does not reconstruct into a 2x2.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Correct Object Extraction:** The current `get_objects` function works correctly with identifying objects.
2.  **Correct Spatial Arrangement:** The biggest error is the assumption that each object extracted is a row, and arranging them on the output simply one after the other. The code must retain each pixel's original column. We also need to be forming a 2x2 output.
3. **Handle relative positioning.** The current approach uses fixed quadrants (top-left, bottom-left). The final output is always 2x2, composed of 4 single color objects. The top row corresponds to the objects to the left of the vertical dividing line, while the bottom row contains objects to the right.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's use code execution to verify colors, sizes for output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Dividers:** Locate the horizontal and vertical lines composed entirely of blue pixels (value '1') within the input grid. These act as dividers.
2.  **Identify Objects:** Divide the input grid into four regions based on the horizontal and vertical dividers: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right. Within each of these regions, identify distinct "objects." An object is a group of connected pixels of the same color, *excluding* the blue divider pixels and background (0 or white).
3. **Determine a consistent output size**: The second example has a 4x4 output grid while examples 1 and 3 have a 2x2. The current rule set would suggest a 2x2 - we should update this.
4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create an output grid.
 - The object from the top-left region becomes the top-left cell of the output
 - The object from the bottom-left region becomes the top-right cell of the output.
 - The object from the top-right region becomes the bottom-left cell.
 - The object from the bottom-right region becomes the bottom-right cell.
 - When an object consists of more than a single pixel, use only the color, not
   the shape, and make the output object a single pixel of that color.
5. **Output grid has variable size**: Examples 1 & 3 suggest 2x2, Example 2 output is size 4x4.
