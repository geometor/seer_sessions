facts:
  - description: "The output grid is always 9x9."
    type: observation
    evidence: "All example output grids are 9x9."

  - description: "The input grid is always 3x3."
    type: observation
    evidence: "All example input grids are 3x3."

  - description: "The output grid's dimensions are three times the input grid's dimensions."
    type: observation
    evidence: "9 / 3 = 3"

  - description: "The input grid is replicated within the output grid."
    type: observation
    evidence: "Visual inspection of examples."

  - description: "The non-zero element counts of the input and output grids are related by an integer factor, depending on padding."
    type: derived
    evidence: "Example 1: output non-zero = 2 * input non-zero;  Example 2:  output non-zero = 1 * input non-zero; Example 3: output non-zero = 3 * input non-zero "

  - description: "Example 1 and 3 seems to be zero padded, while example 2 is not"
    type: observation
    evidence: "visual inspection"
