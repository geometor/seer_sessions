Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the underlying transformation logic. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits (0-9), representing colors.
*   The input grids are larger than the output grids.
*   The output grids seem to be a compressed or extracted version of the input grids.
*   The color black (0) seems to play a significant role as a background or separator.
*   There is one primary color, other than black (0) which has the most connected components, in each input.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 9x9, 7x7, 9x9)
      - elements: digits (0-9)
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: fixed (3x3)
      - elements: digits (0-9)
  - type: color
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: background/separator
  - type: color
    properties:
    - value: other than 0
    - name: target_color
    - description: the non zero color that forms the top left shape in output

actions:
  - name: extract
    description: Extract a 3x3 subgrid from the input grid.
  - name: locate
    description: the target color location at the top left corner.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains output_grid (as a subgrid, conceptually)
  - target color defines an object

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Color:**
    *   The program scans the top left section of input grid to find connected non-zero color.

2.  **Extract Subgrid:**
    *   Once the target color is located, locate the subgrid by looking at the top left corner and using it as the anchor

3.   **Form the 3 x 3 output grid**.
