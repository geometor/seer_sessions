    - description: "Contiguous regions of non-zero pixels."
      properties:
        - color: "Determined by the pixel value."
        - outline: "The boundary of the contiguous region."
        - top_left: "The pixel with the smallest row and column indices within the object."
  - actions:
    - find_top_left: "Locate the top-leftmost non-zero pixel in the input."
    - identify_object: "Determine the object containing the top-left pixel."
    - trace_outline: "Find the complete outline of the identified object."
    - create_output: "Generate a 3x3 grid."
    - fill_outline: "Reproduce the outline of the object on the 3x3, prioritized to show the top and left of the shape"
