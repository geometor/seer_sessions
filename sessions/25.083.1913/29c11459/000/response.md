Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits (0-9), representing colors.
*   The grids have the same dimensions (height and width).
*   The primary change seems to occur in a single row.
*   Non-zero digits in the input row are replaced and expanded in the output.
*   A '5' (grey) appears to be inserted in between any non-zero values.
*   The expansion of the non-zero digits appears symmetric.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D arrays of digits (0-9).
  - dimensions:
      match: true
      note: Input and Output have the same dimensions
  - row_focus:
      description: Changes primarily concentrate on a single row.
  - object_identification:
      non_zero_digits:  Act as "seeds" for expansion.
      zero_digits: Represent background or empty space.
      five_digit: Acts as separator or insert.
  - actions:
    - expansion: Non-zero digits expand symmetrically.
    - insertion:  A '5' is inserted between expanded non-zero digits.
    - replacement: zero values are replaced by expansion

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Row:** Find the row in the input grid that contains non-zero digits.
2.  **Iterate through Non-Zero Digits:** For each non-zero digit in the target row:
    *   Determine Expansion Length: In the example provided, the expansion is 5. We need to verify it on more examples.
    *   Expand the Digit: Replicate current digit to left and to the right.
    *   Insert Separator: Place a '5' (grey) in between expanded non-zero objects.
3. **Maintain other rows:** Other rows values are kept the same.

Essentially the rule centers on locating a row with color and replacing that row with expanded colored regions separated by a grey pixel.
