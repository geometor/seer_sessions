Okay, the tool confirms my last manual count for train_3 was wrong.
Correct counts for train_3 (non-white): Red(2) = 24, Gray(5) = 21.
Total non-white = 45. Total white = 4. Total = 49. Perfect.

Now let's re-evaluate Rule V3 with the correct counts for train_3.

Rule V3 Recap:
1. Filter out white (0) pixels.
2. Count frequencies of remaining colors.
3. If input is 4x4: Output is 1x1 grid of C_min (least frequent non-white).
4. If input is not 4x4:
    a. Find C_max (most frequent non-white) and C_min (least frequent non-white).
    b. Output is 2x2.
    c. Pattern attempt 1: `[[C_max, C_max], [C_min, C_max]]`
       - train_2: C_max=1, C_min=2. -> `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`. Matches!
       - train_3: C_max=2, C_min=5. -> `[[2, 2], [5, 2]]`. Actual output: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. Doesn't match.
    d. Pattern attempt 2: `[[C_min, C_min], [C_min, C_max]]`
       - train_2: C_max=1, C_min=2. -> `[[2, 2], [2, 1]]`. Actual output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`. Doesn't match.
       - train_3: C_max=2, C_min=5. -> `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. Matches!

It seems the pattern depends on the *specific* pair of C_max and C_min colors involved. This feels too arbitrary for ARC.

Let's reconsider the conditions.
Maybe the split isn't 4x4 vs not-4x4.
Maybe it's number of non-white colors? (All examples have 2).
Maybe it's total number of non-white pixels?
train_1: Azure=6, Magenta=9. Total = 15. Output 1x1.
train_2: Red=8, Blue=13. Total = 21. Output 2x2.
train_3: Red=24, Gray=21. Total = 45. Output 2x2.

Hypothesis V4:
1. Filter out white (0) pixels.
2. Count frequencies of remaining colors (C1, C2, ... Cn sorted by frequency desc).
3. If total number of non-white pixels <= 15 (or some threshold): Output is 1x1 grid of C_min (least frequent non-white).
4. If total number of non-white pixels > 15:
    a. Find C_max (most frequent non-white) and C_min (least frequent non-white).
    b. Output is 2x2 grid.
    c. Pattern? Still problematic.

Let's look at the output patterns again:
train_2: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` (C_max=1, C_min=2)
train_3: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` (C_max=2, C_min=5)

Is there a relationship between the *values* of C_max and C_min?
train_2: C_max < C_min (1 < 2). Pattern uses C_max 3 times, C_min 1 time. `[[C_max, C_max], [C_min, C_max]]`
train_3: C_max < C_min (2 < 5). Pattern uses C_min 3 times, C_max 1 time. `[[C_min, C_min], [C_min, C_max]]`

This seems plausible! The pattern depends on the relative numerical values of the most and least frequent colors.

Hypothesis V5:
1. Filter out white (0) pixels from the input grid.
2. If no non-white pixels exist, maybe output empty or background? (Not covered by examples).
3. Count the frequency of each remaining color.
4. If there is only one distinct non-white color, output a 1x1 grid of that color? (Not covered).
5. If there are multiple distinct non-white colors:
    a. Identify the color with the maximum frequency (C_max). If there's a tie, break by choosing the smallest color value.
    b. Identify the color with the minimum frequency (C_min). If there's a tie, break by choosing the smallest color value.
6. Determine the output based on the input grid size:
    a. If the input grid is 4x4: Output is a 1x1 grid containing C_min.
    b. If the input grid is *not* 4x4:
        i. Output is a 2x2 grid.
        ii. Compare the *values* of C_max and C_min:
            - If C_max < C_min: Output is `[[C_max, C_max], [C_min, C_max]]`
            - If C_max > C_min: Output is `[[C_min, C_min], [C_min, C_max]]` (This case covers train_3 where C_max=2, C_min=5... wait, C_max < C_min here too!)

Let's re-check train_3 values: C_max=2, C_min=5. So C_max < C_min.
Rule V5 says the pattern should be `[[C_max, C_max], [C_min, C_max]]` -> `[[2, 2], [5, 2]]`.
Actual output: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`.
So Hypothesis V5 is incorrect. The pattern doesn't seem to depend *only* on the relative values of C_max and C_min.

What else could determine the 2x2 pattern?
Maybe the *difference* in frequencies?
train_2: Counts Blue(1)=13, Red(2)=8. Difference = 5. Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
train_3: Counts Red(2)=24, Gray(5)=21. Difference = 3. Output: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`

Maybe the *total* number of non-white pixels?
train_2: Total = 21. Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
train_3: Total = 45. Output: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`

Maybe the parity of the counts?
train_2: C_max=1 (13, odd), C_min=2 (8, even). Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
train_3: C_max=2 (24, even), C_min=5 (21, odd). Output: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`

Let's define the two patterns observed:
Pattern A: `[[C_max, C_max], [C_min, C_max]]` (Observed in train_2)
Pattern B: `[[C_min, C_min], [C_min, C_max]]` (Observed in train_3)

Conditions leading to Pattern A (train_2): Input 5x5, C_max=1 (odd count), C_min=2 (even count).
Conditions leading to Pattern B (train_3): Input 7x7, C_max=2 (even count), C_min=5 (odd count).

Could the pattern depend on the parity of C_max's count?
If Count(C_max) is odd -> Pattern A
If Count(C_max) is even -> Pattern B

Let's test this.
Hypothesis V6:
1. Filter out white (0) pixels.
2. Count frequencies. Handle empty/single color cases if needed.
3. Find C_max (most frequent, break ties with lowest value) and C_min (least frequent, break ties with lowest value).
4. If input grid is 4x4: Output is 1x1 grid of C_min.
5. If input grid is not 4x4:
    a. Output is 2x2 grid.
    b. Get the count of C_max, let it be Count_max.
    c. If Count_max is odd: Output pattern is `[[C_max, C_max], [C_min, C_max]]`
    d. If Count_max is even: Output pattern is `[[C_min, C_min], [C_min, C_max]]`

Test V6:
-   train_1: Input 4x4. C_min=Azure(8). Output: `[[8]]`. Matches.
-   train_2: Input 5x5. C_max=Blue(1), Count=13 (odd). C_min=Red(2). Pattern should be `[[C_max, C_max], [C_min, C_max]]` -> `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`. Matches!
-   train_3: Input 7x7. C_max=Red(2), Count=24 (even). C_min=Gray(5). Pattern should be `[[C_min, C_min], [C_min, C_max]]` -> `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. Matches!

This looks like a consistent rule covering all examples.

Final check on tie-breaking for C_max/C_min:
- train_1: Counts (8: 6, 6: 9). No ties. C_min=8.
- train_2: Counts (1: 13, 2: 8). No ties. C_max=1, C_min=2.
- train_3: Counts (2: 24, 5: 21). No ties. C_max=2, C_min=5.
Tie-breaking rule wasn't strictly needed but is good practice to include. Let's use "lowest value wins" for both max and min frequency ties.

The natural language program should clearly state these steps.
The perception should highlight the key elements: grid size, color frequencies, conditional output structure.
The facts YAML should capture the core elements: grid dimensions, non-white colors, frequencies, C_max, C_min, output structure dependency.Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure**: The task takes an input grid of varying dimensions (4x4, 5x5, 7x7 shown) and produces a smaller output grid (1x1 or 2x2).
2.  **Color Usage**: The grids use various colors (Azure, Magenta, White, Red, Blue, Gray). White (0) seems to act as a background or irrelevant color, as it doesn't appear in the outputs and seems excluded from the core logic.
3.  **Core Logic - Frequency Analysis**: The transformation appears heavily based on the frequency (count) of non-white colors within the input grid.
4.  **Conditional Behavior**: The transformation rule changes based on the dimensions of the input grid.
    *   A 4x4 input grid results in a 1x1 output grid.
    *   Input grids of other sizes (5x5, 7x7) result in a 2x2 output grid.
5.  **Output Determination (4x4 case)**: For the 4x4 input, the output is the single non-white color that appears *least* frequently in the input.
6.  **Output Determination (non-4x4 case)**: For other input sizes, the output is a 2x2 grid constructed using the *most* frequent non-white color (C_max) and the *least* frequent non-white color (C_min). The specific arrangement within the 2x2 grid depends on the parity (odd/even) of the frequency count of C_max.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Identify all unique non-white (color != 0) pixels present in the input grid.
3.  If no non-white pixels are found, the behavior is undefined by the examples (assume maybe an empty grid or default background grid).
4.  Count the occurrences (frequency) of each unique non-white color.
5.  If only one unique non-white color exists, the behavior is undefined by the examples (assume maybe a 1x1 grid of that color).
6.  If multiple unique non-white colors exist:
    a.  Determine the color with the maximum frequency (`C_max`). If there is a tie in frequency, select the color with the lowest numerical value.
    b.  Determine the color with the minimum frequency (`C_min`). If there is a tie in frequency, select the color with the lowest numerical value.
7.  Check the dimensions (height H, width W) of the input grid.
8.  If the input grid is exactly 4x4 (H=4 and W=4):
    a.  Create a 1x1 output grid.
    b.  Set the value of the single cell in the output grid to `C_min`.
9.  If the input grid is *not* 4x4:
    a.  Create a 2x2 output grid.
    b.  Get the frequency count of `C_max`.
    c.  If the frequency count of `C_max` is odd:
        i.  Arrange the colors in the 2x2 grid as: `[[C_max, C_max], [C_min, C_max]]` (Top row: C_max, C_max. Bottom row: C_min, C_max).
    d.  If the frequency count of `C_max` is even:
        i.  Arrange the colors in the 2x2 grid as: `[[C_min, C_min], [C_min, C_max]]` (Top row: C_min, C_min. Bottom row: C_min, C_max).
10. Return the generated output grid.
