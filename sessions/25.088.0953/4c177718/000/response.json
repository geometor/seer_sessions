            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid is divided into two sections by a horizontal gray line (color 5). The upper section contains three distinct objects of various colors (blue, red, green, yellow, magenta, orange). The lower section contains a single blue object (color 1).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is smaller in height (always 9 rows) but retains the width of the input. It contains two objects, which are copies of two of the objects from the upper section of the input. The output grid is otherwise white (color 0).\n3.  **Transformation Core:** The blue object in the lower section of the input acts as a \"key\". Its *shape* matches the shape of exactly one of the three objects in the upper section. The transformation involves identifying this matching object and *discarding* it. The remaining two objects from the upper section are kept and placed in the output grid.\n4.  **Object Placement in Output:** The two kept objects are stacked vertically in the output grid, centered horizontally. There is no vertical gap between them.\n5.  **Stacking Order:** The vertical order (which object is on top) depends on the horizontal position (left, middle, right) of the *matched/discarded* object in the input's upper section.\n    *   If the leftmost object was matched, the rightmost kept object is placed above the middle kept object. (Examples 1, 2)\n    *   If the middle object was matched, the leftmost kept object is placed above the rightmost kept object. (Examples 3, 4)\n    *   (The case where the rightmost object is matched isn't shown, but symmetry suggests the leftmost kept object would be placed above the middle kept object).\n6.  **Vertical Positioning in Output:** The absolute vertical position of the stacked pair within the 9-row output grid is not simply centered. It appears to depend on both the position of the matched object (left/middle) and the vertical position of the key object (whether it's higher or lower in the bottom section of the input grid).\n    *   Key Object Position: In examples 1 and 3, the key object is lower (rows 11-13). In examples 2 and 4, it's higher (rows 9-11).\n    *   Observed Starting Rows (for the top object of the stack):\n        *   Key Low, Match Left: Start Row 2 (Ex 1)\n        *   Key High, Match Left: Start Row 0 (Ex 2)\n        *   Key Low, Match Middle: Start Row 1 (Ex 3)\n        *   Key High, Match Middle: Start Row 3 (Ex 4)\n7.  **Object Integrity:** The shapes and colors of the kept objects are preserved exactly from input to output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Isolate the three distinct colored objects above the gray line (the \"Upper Objects\") and record their shape, color, and relative horizontal order (Left, Middle, Right).\n3.  Isolate the single blue object below the gray line (the \"Key Object\") and record its shape and its approximate vertical position (\"High\" if its top row is less than 10, \"Low\" if its top row is 10 or greater).\n4.  Compare the shape of the Key Object to the shapes of the three Upper Objects to find the one that matches (the \"Matched Object\"). Note its original horizontal position (Left, Middle, or Right).\n5.  Identify the two Upper Objects that *did not* match the Key Object (the \"Kept Objects\").\n6.  Determine which Kept Object will be placed on top (\"Top Object\") and which below (\"Bottom Object\") in the output stack:\n    *   If the Matched Object was the Left one, the Right Kept Object is the Top Object, and the Middle Kept Object is the Bottom Object.\n    *   If the Matched Object was the Middle one, the Left Kept Object is the Top Object, and the Right Kept Object is the Bottom Object.\n    *   If the Matched Object was the Right one, the Left Kept Object is the Top Object, and the Middle Kept Object is the Bottom Object.\n7.  Determine the starting row index for placing the Top Object in the output grid based on the Key Object's vertical position and the Matched Object's horizontal position:\n    *   If Key was Low and Matched was Left, start row is 2.\n    *   If Key was High and Matched was Left, start row is 0.\n    *   If Key was Low and Matched was Middle, start row is 1.\n    *   If Key was High and Matched was Middle, start row is 3.\n    *   (Assume rules for Matched Right mirror Matched Middle: If Key Low/Match Right -> row 1, If Key High/Match Right -> row 3).\n8.  Create a new grid with the same width as the input and a height of 9, filled with white (0).\n9.  Calculate the horizontal center column of the output grid.\n10. Calculate the necessary column offset to center the Top Object horizontally and draw it onto the output grid starting at the determined start row and the calculated column offset.\n11. Calculate the start row for the Bottom Object, which is immediately below the Top Object (Top Object start row + Top Object height).\n12. Calculate the necessary column offset to center the Bottom Object horizontally and draw it onto the output grid starting at its calculated start row and column offset.\n13. The resulting grid is the final output."
