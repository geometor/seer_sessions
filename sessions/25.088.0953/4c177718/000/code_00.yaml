InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Width: W (e.g., 15)
    - Height: H (e.g., 15)
    - Contains a horizontal gray separator line (color 5).
  Sections:
    - UpperSection:
        - Location: Above the gray line.
        - Contains: Three distinct non-white, non-gray objects (UpperObjects).
        - Object Properties: color, shape, relative horizontal position (Left, Middle, Right).
    - LowerSection:
        - Location: Below the gray line.
        - Contains: One blue object (KeyObject).
        - Object Properties: color (always blue=1), shape, relative vertical position (High or Low based on starting row).

Transformation:
  Steps:
    - Identify UpperObjects and KeyObject.
    - Normalize shapes for comparison (extract pixel pattern relative to bounding box top-left).
    - Find the UpperObject (MatchedObject) whose shape matches KeyObject's shape.
    - Identify the other two UpperObjects (KeptObjects).
    - Determine stacking order for KeptObjects based on MatchedObject's horizontal position:
        - If MatchedObject is Left: Stack Right KeptObject above Middle KeptObject.
        - If MatchedObject is Middle: Stack Left KeptObject above Right KeptObject.
        - If MatchedObject is Right: Stack Left KeptObject above Middle KeptObject. (Inferred)
    - Assign TopObject and BottomObject based on stacking order.
    - Determine vertical position (TopObjectStartRow) for TopObject based on KeyObject's vertical position and MatchedObject's horizontal position:
        - Key Low & Match Left: Row 2
        - Key High & Match Left: Row 0
        - Key Low & Match Middle: Row 1
        - Key High & Match Middle: Row 3
        - (Rules for Match Right need inference/testing, potentially mirror Middle or Left).
    - Calculate placement positions to center the stack horizontally within the output width W.

OutputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Width: W (same as input)
    - Height: 9
    - Background: White (color 0)
  Contents:
    - TopObject and BottomObject placed according to calculated positions and stacking order.
    - Objects are placed without vertical gaps.
    - Objects are centered horizontally.
