*   **Perception:** Each example involves a grid with a prominent green rectangular frame. Inside this frame, the area is initially white, potentially with a few isolated green pixels. The transformation fills the white area inside the frame with alternating colors (yellow and red) based on their proximity to the green boundaries (both the frame and any internal green pixels). The original green pixels (frame and internal) and the white background outside the frame remain unchanged.

*   **Facts YAML:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Fill the area inside a green frame with alternating colors based on distance to the nearest green pixel.
    elements:
      - element: background
        color: white (0)
        role: Unchanged background area outside the frame.
      - element: frame
        color: green (3)
        shape: rectangle
        role: Defines the boundary of the area to be filled. Remains unchanged.
      - element: internal_pixels
        color: green (3)
        location: Inside the frame area.
        role: Act as additional internal boundaries for the fill process. Remain unchanged.
      - element: fill_area
        initial_color: white (0)
        location: Inside the frame, excluding internal green pixels.
        role: The area to be modified.
      - element: fill_color_1
        color: yellow (4)
        role: Used for pixels at odd distances from the nearest green boundary.
      - element: fill_color_2
        color: red (2)
        role: Used for pixels at even distances from the nearest green boundary.
    actions:
      - action: identify_boundaries
        input: input_grid
        elements: [frame, internal_pixels]
        description: Locate all green (3) pixels which serve as boundaries.
      - action: identify_fill_area
        input: input_grid
        elements: [frame, fill_area]
        description: Determine the white (0) pixels enclosed within the green frame.
      - action: calculate_distance
        input: fill_area pixels, boundary pixels
        metric: Manhattan distance
        description: For each pixel in the fill_area, find the minimum Manhattan distance to any boundary (green) pixel.
      - action: apply_fill_colors
        input: fill_area pixels, calculated distances
        output: output_grid
        description: >
          Based on the calculated minimum distance 'd' for each fill_area pixel:
          If d is odd, set the pixel color to yellow (4).
          If d is even, set the pixel color to red (2).
          Pixels with d=0 (the boundaries themselves) and pixels outside the fill_area remain unchanged from the input.
    relationships:
      - relationship: distance_based_coloring
        elements: [fill_area, frame, internal_pixels, fill_color_1, fill_color_2]
        description: The color applied to a pixel in the fill_area depends on its minimum Manhattan distance to the nearest green pixel (frame or internal), alternating between yellow (4) for odd distances and red (2) for even distances.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    2.  Identify all green (3) pixels in the input grid. These are the boundary pixels.
    3.  Identify all white (0) pixels in the input grid that are located inside the region enclosed by the main green rectangular frame. These are the candidate pixels for filling. Use a method like flood fill from the corners to identify exterior white pixels, then consider all other white pixels as interior.
    4.  For each interior white (0) candidate pixel:
        a.  Calculate the Manhattan distance to every green (3) boundary pixel identified in step 2.
        b.  Find the minimum of these calculated distances. Let this minimum distance be `d`.
        c.  If `d` is greater than 0:
            i.  If `d` is odd, change the color of this pixel in the output grid to yellow (4).
            ii. If `d` is even, change the color of this pixel in the output grid to red (2).
    5.  Return the modified output grid. (Pixels not identified as interior white pixels retain their original color from the input).
