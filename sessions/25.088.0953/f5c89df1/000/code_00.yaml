Task: Replicate a shape based on relative marker positions

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors).
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Objects:
      - Anchor: A single green (3) pixel.
      - Template_Shape: A contiguous or non-contiguous shape made of azure (8) pixels.
      - Markers: One or more red (2) pixels.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors) of the same dimensions as the input.
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Objects:
      - Replicated_Shapes: Multiple copies of the input Template_Shape, potentially overlapping, composed of azure (8) pixels.

Transformation_Steps:
  1. Locate the anchor (green pixel).
  2. Locate all markers (red pixels).
  3. Identify all pixels belonging to the template shape (azure pixels).
  4. Calculate the relative position vectors from the anchor to each marker. (marker_pos - anchor_pos).
  5. Create an empty output grid (all white).
  6. For each calculated relative position vector:
     - For each pixel in the input template shape:
       - Calculate the new position by adding the relative position vector to the template pixel's coordinates.
       - Set the pixel at the new position in the output grid to azure (8).
  7. The original anchor, markers, and template shape pixels are not explicitly copied to the output; only the newly calculated azure pixels are present.

Relationships:
  - The position of the output azure shapes depends directly on the relative positions between the input green anchor and the input red markers.
  - The shape of the output azure patterns is identical to the shape of the input azure template shape.
  - The number of replicated azure shapes in the output corresponds to the number of red markers in the input.

Examples_Confirm:
  - Example 1: Green anchor, 4 red markers, azure diamond template. Output has 4 overlapping azure diamonds placed according to the relative positions of the red markers from the green anchor.
  - Example 2: Green anchor, 2 red markers, azure plus-sign template. Output has 2 non-overlapping azure plus-signs placed according to the relative positions.
  - Example 3: Green anchor, 1 red marker, complex azure template. Output has 1 azure shape (identical to the input template) placed according to the relative position of the single red marker from the green anchor.
