The output grids only contain white (0) and azure (8).\n3.  **Key Pixels:** Each input grid contains exactly one green (3) pixel, one or more red (2) pixels, and a shape composed of azure (8) pixels. The white pixels act as background.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves removing the original green, red, and azure pixels. A new pattern of azure pixels is created in the output.\n5.  **Pattern Replication:** The core azure shape present in the input appears to be replicated in the output. The number and locations of these replicas seem determined by the positions of the red pixels relative to the green pixel.\n6.  **Mechanism:** The green pixel acts as an origin or anchor for the azure shape. Each red pixel defines a translation vector (relative to the green pixel). The original azure shape is translated by each of these vectors, and all translated shapes are drawn (superimposed) onto the output grid.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"

Locate the anchor (green pixel).\n  2. Locate all markers (red pixels).\n  3. Identify all pixels belonging to the template shape (azure pixels).\n  4. Calculate the relative position vectors from the anchor to each marker. (marker_pos - anchor_pos).\n  5. Create an empty output grid (all white).\n  6. For each calculated relative position vector:\n     - For each pixel in the input template shape:\n       - Calculate the new position by adding the relative position vector to the template pixel's coordinates.\n       - Set the pixel at the new position in the output grid to azure (8).\n  7. The original anchor, markers, and template shape pixels are not explicitly copied to the output; only the newly calculated azure pixels are present.\n\nRelationships:\n  - The position of the output azure shapes depends directly on the relative positions between the input green anchor and the input red markers.\n  - The shape of the output azure patterns is identical to the shape of the input azure template shape.\n  - The number of replicated azure shapes in the output corresponds to the number of red markers in the input.\n\nExamples_Confirm:\n  - Example 1: Green anchor, 4 red markers, azure diamond template. Output has 4 overlapping azure diamonds placed according to the relative positions of the red markers from the green anchor.\n  - Example 2: Green anchor, 2 red markers, azure plus-sign template. Output has 2 non-overlapping azure plus-signs placed according to the relative positions.\n  - Example 3: Green anchor, 1 red marker, complex azure template. Output has 1 azure shape (identical to the input template) placed according to the relative position of the single red marker from the green anchor.\n```"
