**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a smaller input grid into a larger output grid. Across all examples, the output grid appears to be constructed by repeating the entire input grid pattern multiple times, both horizontally and vertically. The number of repetitions seems directly related to the dimensions of the input grid itself. Specifically, if the input grid has height H and width W, the output grid is formed by tiling the input grid H times vertically and W times horizontally. Consequently, the output grid's dimensions become (H * H) x (W * W).

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: pattern_tiling
input_object:
  type: grid
  properties:
    height: H
    width: W
    pixels: colored integers (0-9)
output_object:
  type: grid
  properties:
    height: H_out = H * H
    width: W_out = W * W
    pixels: colored integers (0-9)
transformation:
  action: tile
  input: input_grid
  repetitions_vertical: H (input height)
  repetitions_horizontal: W (input width)
  result: output_grid composed of an H x W arrangement of input_grid copies
relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are derived from the input grid dimensions.
  - The output grid content is a direct repetition (tiling) of the input grid pattern.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Obtain the input grid.
2.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
3.  Construct the output grid by repeating the input grid pattern H times downwards and W times to the right.
4.  The resulting output grid will have dimensions (H * H) rows and (W * W) columns.
