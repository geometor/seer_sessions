Across all examples, the output grid appears to be constructed by repeating the entire input grid pattern multiple times, both horizontally and vertically. The number of repetitions seems directly related to the dimensions of the input grid itself. Specifically, if the input grid has height H and width W, the output grid is formed by tiling the input grid H times vertically and W times horizontally. Consequently, the output grid's dimensions become (H * H) x (W * W).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
