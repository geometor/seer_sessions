task_type: pattern_tiling
input_object:
  type: grid
  properties:
    height: H
    width: W
    pixels: colored integers (0-9)
output_object:
  type: grid
  properties:
    height: H_out = H * H
    width: W_out = W * W
    pixels: colored integers (0-9)
transformation:
  action: tile
  input: input_grid
  repetitions_vertical: H (input height)
  repetitions_horizontal: W (input width)
  result: output_grid composed of an H x W arrangement of input_grid copies
relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are derived from the input grid dimensions.
  - The output grid content is a direct repetition (tiling) of the input grid pattern.
