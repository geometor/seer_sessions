Critically, the last row of each input grid contains some red pixels (2). The positions of these red pixels in the last row vary between examples.\n*   **Output Pattern:** The output grid is largely similar to the input, but with significantly more red pixels. The red pixels appear in vertical columns.\n*   **Relationship:** There's a clear relationship between the red pixels in the *last row* of the input and the columns filled with red in the output. Specifically, if a column has a red pixel in the last row of the input, that entire column tends to become red in the output.\n*   **Exception/Interaction:** Gray pixels (5) in the input grid seem to resist the transformation. If a cell in the input is gray, it remains gray in the output, even if it's in a column marked by a red pixel in the last row.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
