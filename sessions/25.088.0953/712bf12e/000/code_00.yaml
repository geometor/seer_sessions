task_description: Fill specific columns with red, preserving gray pixels.
grid_properties:
  - size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions for each example.
  - background_color: White (0) is the predominant background color.
objects:
  - object: marker_pixel
    color: red (2)
    location: Present only in the last row of the input grid.
    role: Identifies columns for transformation.
  - object: blocker_pixel
    color: gray (5)
    location: Scattered throughout the input grid.
    role: Persists in the output grid, preventing transformation at its location.
  - object: fill_pixel
    color: red (2)
    location: Appears in specific columns in the output grid.
    role: Result of the transformation process.
transformation:
  - type: column_fill
    trigger: Presence of a red (2) marker_pixel in the last row of a column in the input.
    target_columns: Columns containing a marker_pixel.
    fill_color: red (2)
    condition: Apply fill_color to all cells in the target_columns *unless* the corresponding input cell is a gray (5) blocker_pixel.
  - type: preservation
    target: blocker_pixels (gray, 5)
    action: Copy gray pixels from their input location to the same output location.
    priority: Overrides the column_fill transformation.
relationship:
  - type: vertical_projection
    source: Red pixels in the last input row.
    target: Entire columns in the output grid.
    effect: Determines which columns are candidates for being filled with red.
