## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified solid, monochromatic rectangles and the condition (size >= 3x3) for applying a pattern. However, the implementation of the checkerboard pattern was incorrect. The comparison between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs revealed a consistent inversion of the pattern. The code changed pixels to white based on an *odd* sum of *relative* coordinates within the interior, while the correct rule appears to involve an *even* sum of *absolute* grid coordinates.

The strategy is to correct the checkerboard application logic within the `transform` function based on this new understanding. The rectangle identification logic (`find_solid_rectangles`) seems sound and can be retained.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's re-examine the examples with the corrected hypothesis: "Change interior pixel (r, c) to white (0) if `(r + c) % 2 == 0`".

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 16x15 grid, one red (2) rectangle (8x10) at (4, 4) to (11, 13).
    *   Interior: (5, 5) to (10, 12).
    *   Expected Pattern Check:
        *   Pixel (5, 5): r+c = 10 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.
        *   Pixel (5, 6): r+c = 11 (odd). Expected output is 2. Matches rule.
        *   Pixel (6, 5): r+c = 11 (odd). Expected output is 2. Matches rule.
        *   Pixel (6, 6): r+c = 12 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.
    *   The expected output perfectly follows the `(r + c) % 2 == 0` -> white rule for the interior.
    *   The previous code failed because it used `(rel_r + rel_c) % 2 != 0` -> white. For (5, 5), rel_r=0, rel_c=0, sum=0 (even), so it kept color 2. For (5, 6), rel_r=0, rel_c=1, sum=1 (odd), so it changed to 0. This resulted in the inverted pattern observed.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 13x15 grid, two rectangles: blue (1) 5x5 at (0,0)-(4,4), azure (8) 6x10 at (6,4)-(11,13).
    *   Blue Interior: (1, 1) to (3, 3).
        *   Pixel (1, 1): r+c = 2 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.
        *   Pixel (1, 2): r+c = 3 (odd). Expected output is 1. Matches rule.
    *   Azure Interior: (7, 5) to (10, 12).
        *   Pixel (7, 5): r+c = 12 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.
        *   Pixel (7, 6): r+c = 13 (odd). Expected output is 8. Matches rule.
    *   Again, the expected output follows the `(r + c) % 2 == 0` -> white rule. The previous code failed due to the inverted logic based on relative coordinates.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 17x16 grid, three rectangles: green (3) 7x8 at (1,2)-(7,9), yellow (4) 7x8 at (9,0)-(15,7), azure (8) 5x6 at (9,10)-(13,15).
    *   Green Interior: (2, 3) to (6, 8).
        *   Pixel (2, 3): r+c = 5 (odd). Expected output is 3. Matches rule.
        *   Pixel (2, 4): r+c = 6 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.
    *   Yellow Interior: (10, 1) to (14, 6).
        *   Pixel (10, 1): r+c = 11 (odd). Expected output is 4. Matches rule.
        *   Pixel (10, 2): r+c = 12 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.
    *   Azure Interior: (10, 11) to (12, 14).
        *   Pixel (10, 11): r+c = 21 (odd). Expected output is 8. Matches rule.
        *   Pixel (10, 12): r+c = 22 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.
    *   All expected outputs follow the `(r + c) % 2 == 0` -> white rule. The previous code failed for the same reason as before.

        - interior: Pixel is part of a solid_rectangle, qualifies_for_pattern is True, and the pixel is not on the border.

  - name: apply_pattern
    description: Modify the input grid based on identified rectangles.
    target: Only pixels whose 'role' is 'interior' of a 'qualifying_rectangle'.

    unchanged: Pixels that are 'background', 'border', or 'interior' of non-qualifying rectangles remain unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all solid, monochromatic, non-white (color != 0) rectangular blocks. For each block found, record its color, its bounding box coordinates (top-left: min_r, min_c; bottom-right: max_r, max_c), its height (`max_r - min_r + 1`), and its width (`max_c - min_c + 1`).
3.  Iterate through each identified rectangular block.
4.  Check if the block's height and width are both 3 or greater.
5.  If the block meets the size requirement (height >= 3 and width >= 3):
    a.  Iterate through each pixel location `(r, c)` within the *interior* of this block. The interior region spans rows from `min_r + 1` to `max_r - 1` and columns from `min_c + 1` to `max_c - 1`.
    b.  For each interior pixel `(r, c)`, calculate the sum of its absolute coordinates: `S = r + c`.
    c.  Determine if `S` is even or odd.
    d.  If `S` is even (`S % 2 == 0`), set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to white (0).
    e.  If `S` is odd, the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid keeps its original color (the color of the block).
6.  Pixels that are not part of the interior of a qualifying block (including background pixels, border pixels of all blocks, and all pixels of blocks smaller than 3x3) remain unchanged in the output grid.
7.  Return the final output grid.
