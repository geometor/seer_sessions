            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified solid, monochromatic rectangles and the condition (size >= 3x3) for applying a pattern. However, the implementation of the checkerboard pattern was incorrect. The comparison between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs revealed a consistent inversion of the pattern. The code changed pixels to white based on an *odd* sum of *relative* coordinates within the interior, while the correct rule appears to involve an *even* sum of *absolute* grid coordinates.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the checkerboard application logic within the `transform` function based on this new understanding. The rectangle identification logic (`find_solid_rectangles`) seems sound and can be retained.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's re-examine the examples with the corrected hypothesis: \"Change interior pixel (r, c) to white (0) if `(r + c) % 2 == 0`\".\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 16x15 grid, one red (2) rectangle (8x10) at (4, 4) to (11, 13).\n    *   Interior: (5, 5) to (10, 12).\n    *   Expected Pattern Check:\n        *   Pixel (5, 5): r+c = 10 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.\n        *   Pixel (5, 6): r+c = 11 (odd). Expected output is 2. Matches rule.\n        *   Pixel (6, 5): r+c = 11 (odd). Expected output is 2. Matches rule.\n        *   Pixel (6, 6): r+c = 12 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.\n    *   The expected output perfectly follows the `(r + c) % 2 == 0` -> white rule for the interior.\n    *   The previous code failed because it used `(rel_r + rel_c) % 2 != 0` -> white. For (5, 5), rel_r=0, rel_c=0, sum=0 (even), so it kept color 2. For (5, 6), rel_r=0, rel_c=1, sum=1 (odd), so it changed to 0. This resulted in the inverted pattern observed.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 13x15 grid, two rectangles: blue (1) 5x5 at (0,0)-(4,4), azure (8) 6x10 at (6,4)-(11,13).\n    *   Blue Interior: (1, 1) to (3, 3).\n        *   Pixel (1, 1): r+c = 2 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.\n        *   Pixel (1, 2): r+c = 3 (odd). Expected output is 1. Matches rule.\n    *   Azure Interior: (7, 5) to (10, 12).\n        *   Pixel (7, 5): r+c = 12 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.\n        *   Pixel (7, 6): r+c = 13 (odd). Expected output is 8. Matches rule.\n    *   Again, the expected output follows the `(r + c) % 2 == 0` -> white rule. The previous code failed due to the inverted logic based on relative coordinates.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 17x16 grid, three rectangles: green (3) 7x8 at (1,2)-(7,9), yellow (4) 7x8 at (9,0)-(15,7), azure (8) 5x6 at (9,10)-(13,15).\n    *   Green Interior: (2, 3) to (6, 8).\n        *   Pixel (2, 3): r+c = 5 (odd). Expected output is 3. Matches rule.\n        *   Pixel (2, 4): r+c = 6 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.\n    *   Yellow Interior: (10, 1) to (14, 6).\n        *   Pixel (10, 1): r+c = 11 (odd). Expected output is 4. Matches rule.\n        *   Pixel (10, 2): r+c = 12 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.\n    *   Azure Interior: (10, 11) to (12, 14).\n        *   Pixel (10, 11): r+c = 21 (odd). Expected output is 8. Matches rule.\n        *   Pixel (10, 12): r+c = 22 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.\n    *   All expected outputs follow the `(r + c) % 2 == 0` -> white rule. The previous code failed for the same reason as before.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
