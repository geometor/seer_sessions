task_description: Apply a specific checkerboard pattern to the interior of sufficiently large solid monochromatic rectangles.
artefacts:
  - name: grid
    description: A 2D array representing the state, with pixels colored 0-9 (0 is white/background).
  - name: solid_rectangle
    description: A rectangular area within the grid composed entirely of a single color, where the color is not white (0).
    properties:
      - color: The non-white color of the rectangle.
      - bounding_box: The coordinates defining the rectangle (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
      - height: The number of rows in the rectangle.
      - width: The number of columns in the rectangle.
      - qualifies_for_pattern: True if height >= 3 AND width >= 3.
  - name: pixel
    properties:
      - location: Absolute grid coordinates (row, column).
      - color: Integer value 0-9.
      - role: Can be 'background', 'border', or 'interior'.
        - background: Pixel color is 0 and not part of a modified rectangle's border or interior.
        - border: Pixel is part of a solid_rectangle but lies on its outer edge (min/max row or min/max col).
        - interior: Pixel is part of a solid_rectangle, qualifies_for_pattern is True, and the pixel is not on the border.

actions:
  - name: find_qualifying_rectangles
    description: Identify all solid_rectangles in the input grid. Determine their properties (color, bounding_box, height, width) and if they qualify_for_pattern.
  - name: apply_pattern
    description: Modify the input grid based on identified rectangles.
    target: Only pixels whose 'role' is 'interior' of a 'qualifying_rectangle'.
    rule: For an interior pixel at absolute coordinates (r, c), calculate the sum S = r + c. If S is even (S % 2 == 0), change the pixel's color to white (0). If S is odd, the pixel retains its original color (the color of the rectangle).
    unchanged: Pixels that are 'background', 'border', or 'interior' of non-qualifying rectangles remain unchanged.
