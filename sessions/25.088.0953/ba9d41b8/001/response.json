The checkerboard uses\nthe block's original color and white (0). The pattern starts with the original\ncolor at the top-left corner of the interior. Pixels whose relative row and\ncolumn sum (within the interior, starting from 0,0) is odd are changed to white.\nBackground pixels and block borders remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_solid_rectangles(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all solid, monochromatic rectangular blocks in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a block\n              and contains 'color' (int) and 'bbox' (tuple: min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    blocks = []\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                \n                # Find potential width\n                max_c = c\n                while max_c + 1 < cols and grid[r, max_c + 1] == color and not visited[r, max_c + 1]:\n                    max_c += 1\n                \n                width = max_c - c + 1\n\n                # Find potential height\n                max_r = r\n                is_solid_rectangle = True\n                while max_r + 1 < rows:\n                    # Check if the entire row segment matches the color and is unvisited\n                    row_matches = True\n                    for col_check in range(c, max_c + 1):\n                        if grid[max_r + 1, col_check] != color or visited[max_r + 1, col_check]:\n                            row_matches = False\n                            break\n                    if row_matches:\n                        max_r += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                \n                height = max_r - r + 1\n                \n                # Verify if the entire area is the same color (redundant check if DFS/BFS not used, but safe)\n                # and mark as visited\n                is_block_solid = True\n                pixels_to_visit = []\n                for rr in range(r, max_r + 1):\n                    for cc in range(c, max_c + 1):\n                        if grid[rr, cc] != color or visited[rr,cc]:\n                           # This handles cases where blocks might overlap or the initial scan found\n                           # a non-rectangular shape embedding a rectangle.
