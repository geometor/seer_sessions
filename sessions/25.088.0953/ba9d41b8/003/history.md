"""
Identifies solid-colored rectangular blocks (excluding white) in the input grid.
For each block with dimensions at least 3x3, applies a checkerboard pattern
to its interior pixels (excluding the 1-pixel border). The checkerboard uses
the block's original color and white (0). The pattern starts with the original
color at the top-left corner of the interior. Pixels whose relative row and
column sum (within the interior, starting from 0,0) is odd are changed to white.
Background pixels and block borders remain unchanged.

Train Set Error: syntax error:
unindent does not match any outer indentation level (<unknown>, line 78)
Okay, let's analyze the situation and refine our understanding of the task.

**1. General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided Python code aimed to solve the ARC task by identifying solid rectangular blocks (non-white, >= 3x3) and applying a checkerboard pattern to their interiors. However, it failed execution due to a `SyntaxError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level (<unknown>, line 78)`. This indicates an issue with Python's indentation rules, specifically around the line `is_block_solid = False` within the `find_solid_rectangles` function.

While fixing the syntax error is necessary for execution, the core task now is to re-evaluate the *logic* of the transformation based on *all* examples, not just the one(s) that led to the initial code. The syntax error prevented us from seeing how well the *intended* logic performed across the training set.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Syntax (Mentally):** Assume the indentation error on line 78 is fixed (it should likely align with the `if` statement it belongs to or the preceding loop body).
2.  **Re-examine Core Logic:** Re-assess the fundamental assumptions made in the previous attempt:
    *   Are we *only* looking for solid rectangles?
    *   Is the "non-white" condition always true?
    *   Is the minimum size constraint always 3x3?
    *   Is the pattern always a checkerboard?
    *   Is the checkerboard always applied to the *interior* (excluding the border)?
    *   Is the checkerboard always formed using the original color and white?
    *   Does the pattern always start with the original color at the top-left *interior* cell?
3.  **Gather Metrics (Plan):** To validate these assumptions against the actual examples (which I need to re-examine), I would systematically gather metrics for each input/output pair.
4.  **Refine Description:** Based on a comprehensive review of all examples, update the factual documentation (YAML) and the natural language program.

**2. Gathering Metrics (Plan)**

Since I cannot execute code or see the examples directly in this turn, I will outline the metrics I *would* gather using `tool_code` for each `train` example pair (`input_grid`, `output_grid`):


```python
# Example Metric Gathering Plan (Conceptual)
import numpy as np

# Assume input_grid_list and output_grid_list hold the examples
# train_examples = [ {'input': input_grid_1, 'output': output_grid_1}, ... ]

all_metrics = []

for i, example in enumerate(train_examples):
    input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
    output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
    
    metrics = {
        'example_index': i,
        'input_shape': input_grid.shape,
        'output_shape': output_grid.shape,
        'input_unique_colors': np.unique(input_grid).tolist(),
        'output_unique_colors': np.unique(output_grid).tolist(),
        'changed_pixels_count': np.sum(input_grid != output_grid),
        # Add more detailed analysis here:
        # - Find objects (e.g., contiguous blocks of non-background color) in input
        # - Characterize objects (color, shape, size, bounding box)
        # - Track how input objects correspond to output objects/patterns
        # - Identify specific patterns applied (e.g., checkerboard)
        # - Check if background (color 0) is ever modified
        # - Check if shapes/sizes change beyond internal patterning
    }
    
    # --- Placeholder for Object/Pattern Analysis ---
    # Code to find rectangles (like find_solid_rectangles, but corrected)
    # input_rectangles = find_solid_rectangles(input_grid) 
    # metrics['input_rectangles'] = input_rectangles
    
    # For each rectangle >= 3x3:
    #   Compare its interior in input vs output.
    #   Verify if output interior matches the described checkerboard pattern.
    #   Check if border pixels are unchanged.
    #   Check if smaller rectangles or non-rectangular shapes are modified.
    
    all_metrics.append(metrics)

# print(all_metrics) # This would output the gathered data
```


This systematic data collection would allow verification of the conditions (rectangle shape, size >= 3x3, interior modification, checkerboard pattern, color usage) across all examples.

**3. Facts (Based on Initial Code's Intended Logic)**


```yaml
Analysis:
  Input: A grid containing pixels of different colors. Includes a background color (white, 0) and potentially one or more solid, monochromatic rectangular objects of other colors.
  Output: A grid where specific input objects have been modified internally.
Objects:
  - Type: Solid Rectangles
    Properties:
      - Color: Any color except white (0).
      - Shape: Rectangular.
      - Composition: Monochromatic (single color).
      - Minimum Size: Height >= 3 and Width >= 3.
    Location: Can appear anywhere on the grid.
  - Type: Background
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0).
    Behavior: Remains unchanged.
  - Type: Small Rectangles or Non-Rectangular Shapes
    Properties:
      - Size: Height < 3 or Width < 3 (for rectangles).
      - Shape: Any non-rectangular shape or small rectangle.
    Behavior: Remain unchanged.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all solid, monochromatic, non-white rectangular blocks in the input grid.
  - Filter: Select only those blocks with both height and width greater than or equal to 3.
  - Modify Interior: For each selected block:
    - Define Interior: The region excluding the 1-pixel thick border.
    - Apply Pattern: Fill the interior with a checkerboard pattern.
      - Colors Used: The block's original color and white (0).
      - Pattern Rule:
        - The top-left pixel *of the interior* retains the block's original color.
        - Pixels are colored based on the parity of the sum of their relative coordinates (row + column) within the interior (starting from 0,0).
        - If (relative_row + relative_column) is even, use the original color.
        - If (relative_row + relative_column) is odd, use white (0).
  - Preserve:
    - Borders of modified blocks remain unchanged.
    - Background pixels remain unchanged.
    - Rectangular blocks smaller than 3x3 remain unchanged.
    - Non-rectangular shapes remain unchanged.
```


**4. Natural Language Program (Refined based on Initial Code's Intended Logic)**

1.  **Identify Candidate Objects:** Scan the input grid to find all distinct, contiguous blocks of pixels where each block consists of a single color other than white (0). Determine the bounding box, height, and width for each block. Verify that each identified block is a solid rectangle (all pixels within its bounding box match the block's color).
2.  **Filter Objects by Size:** From the identified solid rectangles, select only those whose height is 3 or more pixels AND whose width is 3 or more pixels.
3.  **Apply Transformation:** For *each* selected rectangle:
    *   Keep the 1-pixel border of the rectangle unchanged.
    *   Consider the *interior* region of the rectangle (the area inside the border).
    *   Modify the pixels within this interior region based on a checkerboard pattern:
        *   Calculate the relative row (`rel_r`) and column (`rel_c`) of each interior pixel, where the top-left pixel of the *interior* is (0, 0).
        *   If the sum (`rel_r + rel_c`) is even, set the pixel's color to the original color of the rectangle.
        *   If the sum (`rel_r + rel_c`) is odd, set the pixel's color to white (0).
4.  **Output:** The final grid consists of the original grid with the checkerboard pattern applied to the interiors of the qualifying rectangles. All other pixels (background, borders of modified rectangles, smaller rectangles, non-rectangular shapes) remain unchanged.
