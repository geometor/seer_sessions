The pattern starts \nsuch that the top-left pixel of the interior retains the block's original color. Specifically, \ninterior pixels whose relative row and column sum (within the interior, starting from 0,0) \nis odd are changed to white (0). Pixels belonging to the background (white), the borders of \nmodified blocks, blocks smaller than 3x3, or non-rectangular shapes remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_solid_rectangles(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all solid, monochromatic rectangular blocks (excluding white) in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a block\n              and contains 'color' (int), 'bbox' (tuple: min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c),\n              'height' (int), and 'width' (int).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    blocks = []\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Skip background color (0) and already visited pixels\n            if grid[r, c] == 0 or visited[r, c]:\n                continue\n\n            color = grid[r, c]\n            \n            # Find the maximum extent of the rectangle starting at (r, c)\n            max_r = r\n            max_c = c\n\n            # Expand width first as far as possible\n            while max_c + 1 < cols and grid[r, max_c + 1] == color and not visited[r, max_c + 1]:\n                max_c += 1\n            \n            current_width = max_c -
