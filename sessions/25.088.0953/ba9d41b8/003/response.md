"""
Identifies solid, monochromatic rectangular blocks (excluding white, color 0) in the input grid. 
For each identified block with both height and width greater than or equal to 3, applies a 
checkerboard pattern to its interior pixels (the area excluding the 1-pixel thick border). 
The checkerboard pattern uses the block's original color and white (0). The pattern starts 
such that the top-left pixel of the interior retains the block's original color. Specifically, 
interior pixels whose relative row and column sum (within the interior, starting from 0,0) 
is odd are changed to white (0). Pixels belonging to the background (white), the borders of 
modified blocks, blocks smaller than 3x3, or non-rectangular shapes remain unchanged.
