Specifically, \ninterior pixels at absolute grid coordinates (r, c) are changed to white (0) if the sum \nof their coordinates (r + c) is even. Pixels where (r + c) is odd retain the block's \noriginal color. Pixels belonging to the background (white), the borders of modified blocks, \nblocks smaller than 3x3, or non-rectangular shapes remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_solid_rectangles(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all solid, monochromatic rectangular blocks (excluding white) in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a block\n              and contains 'color' (int), 'bbox' (tuple: min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c),\n              'height' (int), and 'width' (int).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    blocks = []\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Skip background color (0) and already visited pixels\n            if grid[r, c] == 0 or visited[r, c]:\n                continue\n\n            color = grid[r, c]\n            q = [(r, c)] # Queue for BFS within the potential block\n            current_pixels = set([(r, c)])\n            visited[r, c] = True\n            min_r, min_c = r, c\n            max_r, max_c = r, c\n\n            # Perform BFS to find all connected pixels of the same color\n            while q:\n                row, col = q.pop(0)\n                min_r = min(min_r, row)\n                min_c = min(min_c, col)\n                max_r = max(max_r, row)\n                max_c = max(max_c, col)\n\n                # Check neighbors (4-directional)\n                for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                    nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                       not visited[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == color:\n                        visited[nr, nc] = True\n                        current_pixels.add((nr, nc))\n                        q.append((nr, nc))\n            \n            # Check if the found shape is a solid rectangle\n            height = max_r - min_r + 1\n            width = max_c - min_c + 1\n            is_solid_rectangle = True\n            \n            # Optimization: if the number of pixels doesn't match area, it's not a solid rectangle\n            if len(current_pixels) != height * width:\n                 is_solid_rectangle = False\n            else:\n                # Verify all pixels within the bounding box match the color\n                for rr in range(min_r, max_r + 1):\n                    for cc in range(min_c, max_c + 1):\n                        if grid[rr, cc] != color:\n                            is_solid_rectangle = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_solid_rectangle:\n                        break\n\n            if is_solid_rectangle:\n                # Add the block if it's a solid rectangle\n                blocks.append({\n                    'color': color,\n                    'bbox': (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c),\n                    'height': height,\n                    'width': width\n                })\n            else:\n                 # If it wasn't a solid rectangle, unmark visited pixels belonging to this shape\n                 # so they can be potentially part of other shapes/rectangles later.\n                 # Note: This simple unmarking might be insufficient for complex overlapping shapes,\n                 # but works for finding distinct solid rectangles.
