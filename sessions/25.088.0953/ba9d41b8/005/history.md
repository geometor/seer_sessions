"""
Identifies solid, monochromatic rectangular blocks (excluding white, color 0) in the input grid. 
For each identified block with both height and width greater than or equal to 3, applies a 
checkerboard pattern to its interior pixels (the area excluding the 1-pixel thick border). 
The checkerboard pattern uses the block's original color and white (0). The pattern starts 
such that the top-left pixel of the interior retains the block's original color. Specifically, 
interior pixels whose relative row and column sum (within the interior, starting from 0,0) 
is odd are changed to white (0). Pixels belonging to the background (white), the borders of 
modified blocks, blocks smaller than 3x3, or non-rectangular shapes remain unchanged.

## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified solid, monochromatic rectangles and the condition (size >= 3x3) for applying a pattern. However, the implementation of the checkerboard pattern was incorrect. The comparison between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs revealed a consistent inversion of the pattern. The code changed pixels to white based on an *odd* sum of *relative* coordinates within the interior, while the correct rule appears to involve an *even* sum of *absolute* grid coordinates.

The strategy is to correct the checkerboard application logic within the `transform` function based on this new understanding. The rectangle identification logic (`find_solid_rectangles`) seems sound and can be retained.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's re-examine the examples with the corrected hypothesis: "Change interior pixel (r, c) to white (0) if `(r + c) % 2 == 0`".

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 16x15 grid, one red (2) rectangle (8x10) at (4, 4) to (11, 13).
    *   Interior: (5, 5) to (10, 12).
    *   Expected Pattern Check:
        *   Pixel (5, 5): r+c = 10 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.
        *   Pixel (5, 6): r+c = 11 (odd). Expected output is 2. Matches rule.
        *   Pixel (6, 5): r+c = 11 (odd). Expected output is 2. Matches rule.
        *   Pixel (6, 6): r+c = 12 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.
    *   The expected output perfectly follows the `(r + c) % 2 == 0` -> white rule for the interior.
    *   The previous code failed because it used `(rel_r + rel_c) % 2 != 0` -> white. For (5, 5), rel_r=0, rel_c=0, sum=0 (even), so it kept color 2. For (5, 6), rel_r=0, rel_c=1, sum=1 (odd), so it changed to 0. This resulted in the inverted pattern observed.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 13x15 grid, two rectangles: blue (1) 5x5 at (0,0)-(4,4), azure (8) 6x10 at (6,4)-(11,13).
    *   Blue Interior: (1, 1) to (3, 3).
        *   Pixel (1, 1): r+c = 2 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.
        *   Pixel (1, 2): r+c = 3 (odd). Expected output is 1. Matches rule.
    *   Azure Interior: (7, 5) to (10, 12).
        *   Pixel (7, 5): r+c = 12 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.
        *   Pixel (7, 6): r+c = 13 (odd). Expected output is 8. Matches rule.
    *   Again, the expected output follows the `(r + c) % 2 == 0` -> white rule. The previous code failed due to the inverted logic based on relative coordinates.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 17x16 grid, three rectangles: green (3) 7x8 at (1,2)-(7,9), yellow (4) 7x8 at (9,0)-(15,7), azure (8) 5x6 at (9,10)-(13,15).
    *   Green Interior: (2, 3) to (6, 8).
        *   Pixel (2, 3): r+c = 5 (odd). Expected output is 3. Matches rule.
        *   Pixel (2, 4): r+c = 6 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.
    *   Yellow Interior: (10, 1) to (14, 6).
        *   Pixel (10, 1): r+c = 11 (odd). Expected output is 4. Matches rule.
        *   Pixel (10, 2): r+c = 12 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.
    *   Azure Interior: (10, 11) to (12, 14).
        *   Pixel (10, 11): r+c = 21 (odd). Expected output is 8. Matches rule.
        *   Pixel (10, 12): r+c = 22 (even). Expected output is 0. Matches rule.
    *   All expected outputs follow the `(r + c) % 2 == 0` -> white rule. The previous code failed for the same reason as before.

      - role: Can be 'background', 'border', or 'interior'.
        - background: Pixel color is 0 and not part of a modified rectangle's border or interior.
        - border: Pixel is part of a solid_rectangle but lies on its outer edge (min/max row or min/max col).
        - interior: Pixel is part of a solid_rectangle, qualifies_for_pattern is True, and the pixel is not on the border.

actions:
  - name: find_qualifying_rectangles
    description: Identify all solid_rectangles in the input grid. Determine their properties (color, bounding_box, height, width) and if they qualify_for_pattern.
  - name: apply_pattern
    description: Modify the input grid based on identified rectangles.
    target: Only pixels whose 'role' is 'interior' of a 'qualifying_rectangle'.
    rule: For an interior pixel at absolute coordinates (r, c), calculate the sum S = r + c. If S is even (S % 2 == 0), change the pixel's color to white (0). If S is odd, the pixel retains its original color (the color of the rectangle).
    unchanged: Pixels that are 'background', 'border', or 'interior' of non-qualifying rectangles remain unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all solid, monochromatic, non-white (color != 0) rectangular blocks. For each block found, record its color, its bounding box coordinates (top-left: min_r, min_c; bottom-right: max_r, max_c), its height (`max_r - min_r + 1`), and its width (`max_c - min_c + 1`).
3.  Iterate through each identified rectangular block.
4.  Check if the block's height and width are both 3 or greater.
5.  If the block meets the size requirement (height >= 3 and width >= 3):
    a.  Iterate through each pixel location `(r, c)` within the *interior* of this block. The interior region spans rows from `min_r + 1` to `max_r - 1` and columns from `min_c + 1` to `max_c - 1`.
    b.  For each interior pixel `(r, c)`, calculate the sum of its absolute coordinates: `S = r + c`.
    c.  Determine if `S` is even or odd.
    d.  If `S` is even (`S % 2 == 0`), set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to white (0).
    e.  If `S` is odd, the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid keeps its original color (the color of the block).
6.  Pixels that are not part of the interior of a qualifying block (including background pixels, border pixels of all blocks, and all pixels of blocks smaller than 3x3) remain unchanged in the output grid.
7.  Return the final output grid.
