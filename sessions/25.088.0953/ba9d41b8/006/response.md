## General Assessment

The provided code successfully transforms the first two examples but fails on the third. The results indicate that the core logic of identifying solid rectangles (>= 3x3) and applying a pattern to their interior is likely correct. However, the specific checkerboard pattern rule implemented (`(r + c) % 2 == 0 -> white`, using absolute grid coordinates `r` and `c`) does not generalize to the third example.

The "Transformed Output" presented for Examples 1 and 2 appears inconsistent with the documented code logic (`(r + c) % 2 == 0 -> white`). For instance, in Example 1, the interior cell (5,5) has r+c=10 (even), so the code should make it white (0), which matches the "Transformed Output" and the "Expected Output". However, in Example 3 (Azure block), cell (10,11) has r+c=21 (odd), so the code *should* keep color 8, but the "Transformed Output" shows 0. This suggests either the reported "Transformed Output" does not accurately reflect the execution of the provided code, or there was a misunderstanding in the initial code description/implementation.

Regardless of the previous code's exact behavior, the critical task now is to find a rule consistent with all **Input -> Expected Output** pairs. The failure on the third example, specifically the difference in patterns between the blocks, strongly suggests the pattern depends on relative position within the block's interior, not absolute grid position.

## Metrics

| Example | Input Grid Size | Output Grid Size | Input Colors        | Output Colors       | Objects Found (Color, H, W) >= 3x3 | Pattern Match (Code vs Expected) | Notes                                                                 |
| :------ | :-------------- | :--------------- | :------------------ | :------------------ | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | 16x15           | 16x15            | White(0), Red(2)    | White(0), Red(2)    | Red(2), 8x10                       | True                             | Code output matches expected. Absolute rule `(r+c)%2==0 -> white` works here.   |
| 2       | 13x15           | 13x15            | White(0), Blue(1), Azure(8) | White(0), Blue(1), Azure(8) | Blue(1), 5x5; Azure(8), 6x10       | True                             | Code output matches expected. Absolute rule `(r+c)%2==0 -> white` works here.   |
| 3       | 17x16           | 17x16            | White(0), Green(3), Yellow(4), Azure(8) | White(0), Green(3), Yellow(4), Azure(8) | Green(3), 7x8; Yellow(4), 7x8; Azure(8), 5x6 | False (Pixels Off: 72)           | Code output differs significantly from expected for Green and Yellow blocks. |

**Analysis of Mismatch in Example 3:**
The pattern applied by the code (assuming `(r+c)%2==0 -> white`) matches the expected output only for the Azure block, but not for the Green and Yellow blocks. Conversely, if the code accidentally implemented `(r+c)%2!=0 -> white`, it would match Green and Yellow but not Azure (based on the reported "Transformed Output"). The consistent failure across different blocks with a simple absolute coordinate rule suggests the rule must be relative.

Let's test the relative coordinate hypothesis: `(rel_r + rel_c) % 2 == 0 -> white`, where `rel_r, rel_c` are 0-indexed coordinates within the interior.
-   **Ex 1 (Red):** Interior starts at (5, 5). Cell (5, 5) -> rel (0,0). 0+0=0 (even). Expected: 0. Matches. Cell (5, 6) -> rel (0,1). 0+1=1 (odd). Expected: 2. Matches.
-   **Ex 2 (Blue):** Interior starts at (1, 1). Cell (1, 1) -> rel (0,0). 0+0=0 (even). Expected: 0. Matches. Cell (1, 2) -> rel (0,1). 0+1=1 (odd). Expected: 1. Matches.
-   **Ex 2 (Azure):** Interior starts at (7, 5). Cell (7, 5) -> rel (0,0). 0+0=0 (even). Expected: 0. Matches. Cell (7, 6) -> rel (0,1). 0+1=1 (odd). Expected: 8. Matches.
-   **Ex 3 (Green):** Interior starts at (2, 3). Cell (2, 3) -> rel (0,0). 0+0=0 (even). Expected: 0. Matches. Cell (2, 4) -> rel (0,1). 0+1=1 (odd). Expected: 3. Matches.
-   **Ex 3 (Yellow):** Interior starts at (10, 1). Cell (10, 1) -> rel (0,0). 0+0=0 (even). Expected: 0. Matches. Cell (10, 2) -> rel (0,1). 0+1=1 (odd). Expected: 4. Matches.
-   **Ex 3 (Azure):** Interior starts at (10, 11). Cell (10, 11) -> rel (0,0). 0+0=0 (even). Expected: 0. Matches. Cell (10, 12) -> rel (0,1). 0+1=1 (odd). Expected: 8. Matches.

This relative rule works for all examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Copy** the input grid to create the output grid.
2.  **Identify** all distinct, solid, monochromatic rectangular blocks in the input grid, ignoring the background color (White, 0). For each block, determine its color, bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col), height, and width.
3.  **Iterate** through each identified rectangular block.
4.  **Check** if the block's height and width are both greater than or equal to 3.
5.  **If** the block meets the size criteria (>= 3x3):
    a.  Determine the bounding box of the block's *interior*:
        *   `interior_min_row = min_row + 1`
        *   `interior_min_col = min_col + 1`
        *   `interior_max_row = max_row - 1`
        *   `interior_max_col = max_col - 1`
    b.  **Iterate** through each pixel `(r, c)` within this interior (from `interior_min_row` to `interior_max_row` and `interior_min_col` to `interior_max_col`).
    c.  Calculate the **relative row index** `rel_r = r - interior_min_row` and the **relative column index** `rel_c = c - interior_min_col` (these indices start from 0 at the top-left corner of the interior).
    d.  **Check** if the sum `(rel_r + rel_c)` is even.
    e.  **If** the sum `(rel_r + rel_c)` is even, set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** to White (0). (If the sum is odd, the pixel retains its original color, which is already present in the copied output grid).
6.  **Return** the modified output grid.
