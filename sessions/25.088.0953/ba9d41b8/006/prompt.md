"""
Identifies solid, monochromatic rectangular blocks (excluding white, color 0) in the input grid. 
For each identified block with both height and width greater than or equal to 3, applies a 
checkerboard pattern to its interior pixels (the area excluding the 1-pixel thick border). 
The checkerboard pattern uses white (0) and the block's original color. Specifically, 
interior pixels at absolute grid coordinates (r, c) are changed to white (0) if the sum 
of their coordinates (r + c) is even. Pixels where (r + c) is odd retain the block's 
original color. Pixels belonging to the background (white), the borders of modified blocks, 
blocks smaller than 3x3, or non-rectangular shapes remain unchanged.
