Specifically, \ninterior pixels at absolute grid coordinates (r, c) are changed to white (0) if the sum \nof their *relative* coordinates within the interior (rel_r, rel_c) is even. The relative \ncoordinates (rel_r, rel_c) are calculated starting from (0, 0) at the top-left corner \nof the interior region. Pixels where (rel_r + rel_c) is odd retain the block's original color. \nPixels belonging to the background (white), the borders of modified blocks, blocks smaller \nthan 3x3, or non-rectangular shapes remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_solid_rectangles(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all solid, monochromatic rectangular blocks (excluding white) in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a block\n              and contains 'color' (int), 'bbox' (tuple: min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c),\n              'height' (int), and 'width' (int).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    blocks = []\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Skip background color (0) or already visited pixels\n            if grid[r, c] == 0 or visited[r, c]:\n                continue\n\n            color = grid[r, c]\n            \n            # Find the maximum horizontal extent of the same color starting from (r, c)\n            # only considering unvisited cells in this row.\n            max_c_initial = c\n            while max_c_initial + 1 < cols and grid[r, max_c_initial + 1] == color and not visited[r, max_c_initial + 1]:\n                max_c_initial += 1\n            \n            initial_width = max_c_initial -
