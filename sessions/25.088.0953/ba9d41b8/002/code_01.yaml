Analysis:
  Input: A grid containing pixels of different colors. Includes a background color (white, 0) and potentially one or more solid, monochromatic rectangular objects of other colors.
  Output: A grid where specific input objects have been modified internally.
Objects:
  - Type: Solid Rectangles
    Properties:
      - Color: Any color except white (0).
      - Shape: Rectangular.
      - Composition: Monochromatic (single color).
      - Minimum Size: Height >= 3 and Width >= 3.
    Location: Can appear anywhere on the grid.
  - Type: Background
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0).
    Behavior: Remains unchanged.
  - Type: Small Rectangles or Non-Rectangular Shapes
    Properties:
      - Size: Height < 3 or Width < 3 (for rectangles).
      - Shape: Any non-rectangular shape or small rectangle.
    Behavior: Remain unchanged.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all solid, monochromatic, non-white rectangular blocks in the input grid.
  - Filter: Select only those blocks with both height and width greater than or equal to 3.
  - Modify Interior: For each selected block:
    - Define Interior: The region excluding the 1-pixel thick border.
    - Apply Pattern: Fill the interior with a checkerboard pattern.
      - Colors Used: The block's original color and white (0).
      - Pattern Rule:
        - The top-left pixel *of the interior* retains the block's original color.
        - Pixels are colored based on the parity of the sum of their relative coordinates (row + column) within the interior (starting from 0,0).
        - If (relative_row + relative_column) is even, use the original color.
        - If (relative_row + relative_column) is odd, use white (0).
  - Preserve:
    - Borders of modified blocks remain unchanged.
    - Background pixels remain unchanged.
    - Rectangular blocks smaller than 3x3 remain unchanged.
    - Non-rectangular shapes remain unchanged.
