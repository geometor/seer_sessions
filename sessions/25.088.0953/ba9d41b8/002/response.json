General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided Python code aimed to solve the ARC task by identifying solid rectangular blocks (non-white, >= 3x3) and applying a checkerboard pattern to their interiors. However, it failed execution due to a `SyntaxError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level (<unknown>, line 78)`. This indicates an issue with Python's indentation rules, specifically around the line `is_block_solid = False` within the `find_solid_rectangles` function.\n\nWhile fixing the syntax error is necessary for execution, the core task now is to re-evaluate the *logic* of the transformation based on *all* examples, not just the one(s) that led to the initial code. The syntax error prevented us from seeing how well the *intended* logic performed across the training set.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct Syntax (Mentally):** Assume the indentation error on line 78 is fixed (it should likely align with the `if` statement it belongs to or the preceding loop body).\n2.  **Re-examine Core Logic:** Re-assess the fundamental assumptions made in the previous attempt:\n    *   Are we *only* looking for solid rectangles?\n    *   Is the \"non-white\" condition always true?\n    *   Is the minimum size constraint always 3x3?\n    *   Is the pattern always a checkerboard?\n    *   Is the checkerboard always applied to the *interior* (excluding the border)?\n    *   Is the checkerboard always formed using the original color and white?\n    *   Does the pattern always start with the original color at the top-left *interior* cell?\n3.  **Gather Metrics (Plan):** To validate these assumptions against the actual examples (which I need to re-examine), I would systematically gather metrics for each input/output pair.\n4.  **Refine Description:** Based on a comprehensive review of all examples, update the factual documentation (YAML) and the natural language program.\n\n**2. Gathering Metrics (Plan)**\n\nSince I cannot execute code or see the examples directly in this turn, I will outline the metrics I *would* gather using `tool_code` for each `train` example pair (`input_grid`, `output_grid`):\n\n"
