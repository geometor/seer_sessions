*   **Perception**: The task involves modifying the interior of solid-colored rectangular blocks found in the input grid. The background (white pixels, value 0) and the 1-pixel thick border of each block remain unchanged. The modification consists of applying a checkerboard pattern to the interior pixels of each block, using white (0) for one set of squares in the checkerboard pattern and the original block color for the other set. The specific checkerboard pattern starts with the original color in the top-left corner of the interior region and alternates with white.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    Objects:
      - type: grid
        description: The input and output are 2D grids of pixels with integer color values (0-9).
      - type: background
        properties:
          color: white (0)
          location: Pixels not belonging to any colored block.
      - type: block
        properties:
          color: Any color except white (1-9).
          shape: Solid rectangle.
          location: Defined by a bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
          parts:
            - border: The outermost 1-pixel layer of the block.
            - interior: Pixels within the block excluding the border.
    Relationships:
      - Blocks are distinct and separated by the background.
      - Each pixel belongs either to the background or to one specific block.
      - Pixels within a block's interior have relative coordinates with respect to the interior's top-left corner.
    Actions:
      - Identify: Locate all solid-colored rectangular blocks in the input grid.
      - Define_Interior: For each block, determine the region excluding its 1-pixel border.
      - Calculate_Relative_Coordinates: For each pixel (r, c) in the interior, find its relative row `rel_r` and column `rel_c` starting from 0 at the top-left of the interior.
      - Apply_Pattern:
        - Check the parity of the sum `rel_r + rel_c`.
        - If `rel_r + rel_c` is odd, change the pixel's color to white (0).
        - If `rel_r + rel_c` is even, the pixel retains its original block color.
      - Preserve: Keep the background pixels and the border pixels of each block unchanged from the input to the output.
      - Construct_Output: Assemble the modified interiors, preserved borders, and background into the final output grid.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify all contiguous rectangular blocks of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    3.  For each identified block:
        a.  Determine its bounding box: top row `min_r`, bottom row `max_r`, left column `min_c`, right column `max_c`.
        b.  If the block has a height or width less than 3 pixels, it has no interior, so make no changes to this block.
        c.  Otherwise, define the interior region starting from row `min_r + 1` to `max_r - 1` and column `min_c + 1` to `max_c - 1`.
        d.  Iterate through each pixel within this interior region, using absolute coordinates `(r, c)`.
        e.  Calculate the relative row index within the interior: `rel_r = r - (min_r + 1)`.
        f.  Calculate the relative column index within the interior: `rel_c = c - (min_c + 1)`.
        g.  Check if the sum `rel_r + rel_c` is odd.
        h.  If the sum is odd, set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to white (0).
    4.  Return the modified output grid.
