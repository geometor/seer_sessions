The background (white pixels, value 0) and the 1-pixel thick border of each block remain unchanged. The modification consists of applying a checkerboard pattern to the interior pixels of each block, using white (0) for one set of squares in the checkerboard pattern and the original block color for the other set. The specific checkerboard pattern starts with the original color in the top-left corner of the interior region and alternates with white.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
