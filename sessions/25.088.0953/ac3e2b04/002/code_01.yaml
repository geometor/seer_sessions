observations:
  - task: Fill enclosed white regions and conditionally change adjacent red pixels based on shape and adjacency.
  - grid_properties:
      - Input and output grids share the same dimensions.
      - White (0) is the primary background color.
      - Red (2) and Green (3) pixels form shapes and boundaries.
      - Blue (1) appears only in the output, replacing some white and red pixels.
  - objects:
      - White Pixels (0): Exist as border-connected background or enclosed regions.
      - Red Pixels (2): Can form horizontal lines, vertical lines, or other shapes. The horizontal context is important.
      - Green Pixels (3): Form parts of boundaries, but do not change color.
  - actions:
      - Identify Connectivity: Determine which white pixels are connected to the border solely through paths of other white pixels (using 4-way adjacency). White pixels lacking such a path are 'enclosed'.
      - Identify Shape Context: Determine which red pixels are part of a horizontal line segment of length 2 or more.
      - Check Adjacency: Determine if a red pixel (meeting the horizontal line criteria) is adjacent (using 8-way adjacency, including diagonals) to any 'enclosed' white pixel.
      - Conditional Color Change:
          - Change all 'enclosed' white pixels to blue (1).
          - Change red pixels meeting both the 'horizontal line' and 'adjacency to enclosed white' criteria to blue (1).
      - Preservation: All other pixels (border-connected white, non-adjacent red, vertical-line red, green, etc.) remain unchanged.
