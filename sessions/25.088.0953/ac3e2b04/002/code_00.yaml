observations:
  - task: Fill enclosed areas and modify specific adjacent pixels.
  - grid_properties:
      - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
      - The background color is typically white (0).
      - Objects are primarily composed of red (2) and green (3) pixels.
      - Blue (1) is introduced in the output grid.
  - objects:
      - White Pixels (0): Can form large background areas connected to the border, or smaller enclosed regions.
      - Red Pixels (2): Can form lines (horizontal or vertical) or parts of other shapes.
      - Green Pixels (3): Form shapes, often enclosing white pixels alongside red pixels.
  - actions:
      - Identify white pixels: Distinguish between those connected to the border via white paths (using 4-connectivity) and those that are not (enclosed).
      - Identify specific red pixels: Locate red pixels that are part of a contiguous horizontal sequence of at least two red pixels.
      - Modify pixels (Color Change):
          - Change all enclosed white pixels to blue (1).
          - Change specific red pixels (identified above) to blue (1) IF they are adjacent (using 8-connectivity, including diagonals) to any of the enclosed white pixels (which are now blue).
      - Preserve pixels: All other pixels (border-connected white, non-adjacent red, vertical-line red, green, etc.) retain their original color.
