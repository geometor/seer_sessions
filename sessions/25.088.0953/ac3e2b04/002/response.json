            "text": "**Metric Analysis Insights:**\n\n1.  **Shapes:** Input and Output shapes always match. The transformation doesn't change grid dimensions.\n2.  **Colors:**\n    *   Inputs contain white (0) and usually red (2) and green (3).\n    *   Expected outputs contain the input colors *plus* blue (1).\n    *   Transformed outputs (from the previous code) only contain the original input colors, crucially missing blue (1). This confirms the filling step failed.\n3.  **Pixel Counts:**\n    *   `Expected Output Blue (1) Count` matches `Pixels Off in Transformation` exactly in Examples 3 & 4. In Examples 1 & 2, `Pixels Off` is slightly higher.\n    *   `Pixels White in Input & Blue in Expected Output` shows how many white pixels *should* have turned blue.\n    *   `Non-White Pixels Changed`: This value is non-zero in Examples 1, 2, and 4. Let's re-examine those.\n        *   Ex 1: Input (6,4)=2, (6,6)=2. Output (6,4)=1, (6,6)=1. Yes, two red pixels changed to blue.\n        *   Ex 2: Input (2,8)=0, (2,11)=0, (11,2)=0, (11,8)=0. Output (2,8)=1, (2,11)=1, (11,2)=1, (11,8)=1. No, these were white becoming blue. Let's recheck the calculation... Ah, `np.sum((input_grid != 0) & (input_grid != expected_output))`\n        *   Ex 2 Input: (2,2)=3, (2,4)=3. Expected: (2,2)=3, (2,4)=3.\n        *   Ex 2 Input: (2,3)=2. Expected: (2,3)=2.\n        *   Ex 2 Input: (11,3)=2. Expected: (11,3)=2.\n        *   Let's check the specific pixels that differ between input and expected output in Ex 2 where input is non-zero.\n            *   Input (2, 2:5) = [3, 2, 3]. Expected (2, 2:5) = [3, 2, 3]. No change.\n            *   Input (11, 10:13) = [3, 2, 3]. Expected (11, 10:13) = [3, 2, 3]. No change.\n            *   It seems the calculation `Non-White Pixels Changed` might be catching cases where a non-white pixel in the input becomes *white* in the output, or something else unexpected. Let's recalculate manually.\n            *   Comparing Input 2 and Expected 2: Find coordinates (r, c) where `Input[r,c] != 0` and `Input[r,c] != Expected[r,c]`.\n                *   (2,8): Input=0, Expected=1. Doesn't count.\n                *   (2,9): Input=0, Expected=1. Doesn't count.\n                *   (2,10): Input=2, Expected=2. Doesn't count.\n                *   (2,11): Input=0, Expected=1. Doesn't count.\n                *   (11,2): Input=0, Expected=1. Doesn't count.\n                *   (11,8): Input=0, Expected=1. Doesn't count.\n                *   (11,10): Input=3, Expected=3. Doesn't count.\n                *   (11,11): Input=2, Expected=2. Doesn't count.\n                *   (11,12): Input=3, Expected=3. Doesn't count.\n            *   There seem to be *zero* non-white pixels changing in Example 2. The metric calculation might be flawed or comparing intermediate results incorrectly. Let's focus on the core observation: white pixels become blue.\n        *   Ex 4: Input (3,4)=2, (3,6)=2, (8,4)=2, (8,6)=2, (14,4)=2, (14,6)=2, (14,10)=2, (14,12)=2. Output (3,4)=1, (3,6)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,6)=1, (14,4)=1, (14,6)=1, (14,10)=1, (14,12)=1. Yes, eight red (2) pixels changed to blue (1).\n\n4.  **Correction to Initial Hypothesis:** The transformation is *not* just filling enclosed white pixels. In Examples 1, 2, and 4, some non-white pixels (specifically red=2) *also* change to blue (1). Which red pixels change?\n    *   Ex 1: (6,4) and (6,6). These are red pixels adjacent to the enclosed white region being filled.\n    *   Ex 2: Re-examining Ex 2 Output:\n        "

Let's trust visual inspection.\n    *   Ex 3: No non-white pixels change.\n    *   Ex 4: (3,4), (3,6), (8,4), (8,6), (14,4), (14,6), (14,10), (14,12). All are red=2. Where are they relative to the filled areas? They are adjacent to the newly filled blue areas.\n\n5.  **Revised Hypothesis:**\n    1.  Identify all white (0) pixels that are *not* connected to the border via a path of only white pixels. Let's call these \"enclosed white pixels\".\n    2.  Create the output grid initially as a copy of the input grid.\n    3.  Change all \"enclosed white pixels\" in the output grid to blue (1).\n    4.  Identify all red (2) pixels in the input grid that are adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally?) to any of the \"enclosed white pixels\" identified in step 1.\n    5.  Change these specific red (2) pixels in the output grid to blue (1).\n\n6.  **Check Revised Hypothesis:**\n    *   Ex 1: White pixels like (3,5) are enclosed. Red pixels (6,4) and (6,6) are adjacent to the enclosed white region around (7,4)-(7,6). This fits. Adjacency seems to be orthogonal or diagonal. (6,4) is adjacent to (7,4). (6,6) is adjacent to (7,6).\n    *   Ex 2: Only enclosed white pixels change. No red pixels are adjacent? Let's see. The filled region at the top right is (1,8)-(1,10), (2,8), (2,10), (3,8)-(3,10). Are there adjacent red pixels? Yes, (2,9)=2. But (2,9) does *not* change to blue in the output. Why not? What's different about Ex 1 and Ex 4?\n    *   Ex 3: Only enclosed white pixels change. Are there adjacent red pixels? Yes, (6,4)=2 is adjacent to (7,3)=1 (originally 0). But (6,4) does not change.\n    *   Ex 4: Red pixels (3,4), (3,6) are adjacent to enclosed white pixels like (2,4). Red pixels (8,4), (8,6) are adjacent to enclosed white pixels like (7,4). Red pixels (14,4), (14,6), (14,10), (14,12) are adjacent to enclosed white pixels. This fits.\n\n7.  **Re-Revising Hypothesis:** Why do adjacent red pixels change in Ex 1 and 4 but not Ex 2 and 3?\n    *   Look at the red objects. In Ex 1 and 4, the red pixels that change are part of larger horizontal red lines. In Ex 2 and 3, the red pixels that *don't* change are part of vertical red lines or single points within green shapes.\n    *   Maybe the rule is specific to red pixels that are part of a horizontal line of red pixels of length >= 2?\n        *   Ex 1: Pixels (6,4) and (6,6) are part of the line (6,0) to (6,9), all red=2. This line has length 10. Fits.\n        *   Ex 4: Pixels (3,4), (3,6) are part of line (3,0) to (3,13). Length 14. Fits. Pixels (8,4), (8,6) are part of line (8,0) to (8,13). Length 14. Fits. Pixels (14,4), (14,6) are part of line (14,0) to (14,13). Length 14. Fits. Pixels (14,10), (14,12) are also part of that line. Fits.\n        *   Ex 2: Pixel (2,9)=2 is part of a vertical line of 2s from (0,9) to (14,9). Not horizontal. Doesn't change. Fits.\n        *   Ex 3: Pixel (6,4)=2 is part of a vertical line from (0,4) to (11,4). Not horizontal. Doesn't change. Fits.\n\n8.  **Final (?) Hypothesis:**\n    1.  Identify all white (0) pixels not connected to the border via a path of only white pixels (\"enclosed white pixels\"). Use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) for the path check.\n    2.  Find all red (2) pixels that belong to a horizontal contiguous segment of red pixels of length 2 or more.\n    3.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input.\n    4.  Change all \"enclosed white pixels\" to blue (1) in the output grid.\n    5.  Change any red pixel identified in step 2 that is adjacent (using 8-connectivity - including diagonals) to any \"enclosed white pixel\" (from step 1) to blue (1) in the output grid.\n\nThis seems to cover all cases observed. The BFS approach for step 1 is still valid, assuming it can be implemented correctly. Steps 2, 4, and 5 need careful implementation.\n\n---\n## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying enclosed white regions (pixels with value 0) using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the border and filling these regions with blue (pixel value 1). The results clearly show this approach failed, as the transformed output was identical to the input in all test cases, meaning no pixels were changed to blue.\n\nAnalysis of the expected outputs compared to the inputs reveals two key transformation components:\n1.  **Filling Enclosed White Regions:** White pixels (0) that are not reachable from the grid border via a path of only white pixels are changed to blue (1). This matches the original intent.\n2.  **Changing Specific Red Pixels:** In some examples (1 and 4), certain red pixels (2) are also changed to blue (1). These changing red pixels appear to be part of horizontal red lines (contiguous sequences of red pixels horizontally) and are adjacent (including diagonals) to the white pixels that were filled in step 1. Red pixels that are part of vertical lines or are not adjacent to newly filled areas do not change.\n\nThe failure of the previous code suggests either a flaw in the BFS implementation (incorrectly marking enclosed areas as reachable) or an issue in applying the results of the BFS. The strategy moving forward is to implement the revised two-part hypothesis, ensuring the BFS correctly identifies unreachable white pixels and then applying the conditional change to adjacent horizontal red line pixels.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the code execution and manual verification:\n\n| Example | Dimensions | Input Colors | Output Colors | Input White (0) | Output Blue (1) | White->Blue | Unchanged White | Horizontal Red (2) Changed to Blue (1) | Other Non-White Changed |\n| :------ | :--------- | :----------- | :------------ | :-------------- | :-------------- | :---------- | :-------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------- |\n| 1       | (10, 10)   | 0, 2, 3      | 0, 1, 2, 3    | 74              | 12              | 10          | 64              | 2 (pixels (6,4), (6,6))                  | 0                       |\n| 2       | (15, 12)   | 0, 2, 3      | 0, 1, 2, 3    | 138             | 28              | 28          | 110             | 0                                        | 0                       |\n| 3       | (12, 12)   | 0, 2, 3      | 0, 1, 2, 3    | 126             | 9               | 9           | 117             | 0                                        | 0                       |\n| 4       | (16, 14)   | 0, 2, 3      | 0, 1, 2, 3    | 170             | 46              | 38          | 132             | 8 (pixels (3,4),(3,6),(8,4),(8,6), etc.) | 0                       |\n\n*   **White->Blue:** Count of pixels that were 0 in input and 1 in output.\n*   **Unchanged White:** Count of pixels that were 0 in input and 0 in output (border-connected).\n*   **Horizontal Red (2) Changed to Blue (1):** Count of pixels that were 2 in input, 1 in output, and met the horizontal line + adjacency criteria.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

The strategy is to re-implement the logic based on the refined understanding, ensuring both the enclosed white fill and the conditional red pixel modification are handled correctly.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Dimensions | Input Colors | Output Colors | Input White (0) | Output Blue (1) | White->Blue | Unchanged White | Horizontal Red (2) Changed to Blue (1) | Other Non-White Changed |\n| :------ | :--------- | :----------- | :------------ | :-------------- | :-------------- | :---------- | :-------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------- |\n| 1       | (10, 10)   | 0, 2, 3      | 0, 1, 2, 3    | 74              | 12              | 10          | 64              | 2 (pixels (6,4), (6,6))                  | 0                       |\n| 2       | (15, 12)   | 0, 2, 3      | 0, 1, 2, 3    | 138             | 28              | 28          | 110             | 0                                        | 0                       |\n| 3       | (12, 12)   | 0, 2, 3      | 0, 1, 2, 3    | 126             | 9               | 9           | 117             | 0                                        | 0                       |\n| 4       | (16, 14)   | 0, 2, 3      | 0, 1, 2, 3    | 170             | 46              | 38          | 132             | 8 (pixels (3,4),(3,6),(8,4),(8,6), etc.) | 0                       |\n\n*   **White->Blue:** Count of pixels that were 0 in input and 1 in output.\n*   **Unchanged White:** Count of pixels that were 0 in input and 0 in output (border-connected).\n*   **Horizontal Red (2) Changed to Blue (1):** Count of pixels that were 2 in input, 1 in output, and met the horizontal line + adjacency criteria.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
