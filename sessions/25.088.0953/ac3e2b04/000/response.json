In some examples, the center pixel of the 'H' is red.\n    *   The red pixels often form lines or rectangles, frequently adjacent to or encompassing the green 'H' shape.\n    *   The output grids are identical to the input grids, except some white (0) pixels are changed to blue (1).\n    *   The blue (1) pixels appear exclusively in areas that were originally white (0) and seem to be \"contained\" or \"enclosed\" by the combined structure of red and green pixels.\n    *   The task appears to involve identifying enclosed white regions and filling them with blue.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
