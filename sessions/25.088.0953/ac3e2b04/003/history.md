**Metric Analysis Insights:**

1.  **Shapes:** Input and Output shapes always match. The transformation doesn't change grid dimensions.
2.  **Colors:**
    *   Inputs contain white (0) and usually red (2) and green (3).
    *   Expected outputs contain the input colors *plus* blue (1).
    *   Transformed outputs (from the previous code) only contain the original input colors, crucially missing blue (1). This confirms the filling step failed.
3.  **Pixel Counts:**
    *   `Expected Output Blue (1) Count` matches `Pixels Off in Transformation` exactly in Examples 3 & 4. In Examples 1 & 2, `Pixels Off` is slightly higher.
    *   `Pixels White in Input & Blue in Expected Output` shows how many white pixels *should* have turned blue.
    *   `Non-White Pixels Changed`: This value is non-zero in Examples 1, 2, and 4. Let's re-examine those.
        *   Ex 1: Input (6,4)=2, (6,6)=2. Output (6,4)=1, (6,6)=1. Yes, two red pixels changed to blue.
        *   Ex 2: Input (2,8)=0, (2,11)=0, (11,2)=0, (11,8)=0. Output (2,8)=1, (2,11)=1, (11,2)=1, (11,8)=1. No, these were white becoming blue. Let's recheck the calculation... Ah, `np.sum((input_grid != 0) & (input_grid != expected_output))`
        *   Ex 2 Input: (2,2)=3, (2,4)=3. Expected: (2,2)=3, (2,4)=3.
        *   Ex 2 Input: (2,3)=2. Expected: (2,3)=2.
        *   Ex 2 Input: (11,3)=2. Expected: (11,3)=2.
        *   Let's check the specific pixels that differ between input and expected output in Ex 2 where input is non-zero.
            *   Input (2, 2:5) = [3, 2, 3]. Expected (2, 2:5) = [3, 2, 3]. No change.
            *   Input (11, 10:13) = [3, 2, 3]. Expected (11, 10:13) = [3, 2, 3]. No change.
            *   It seems the calculation `Non-White Pixels Changed` might be catching cases where a non-white pixel in the input becomes *white* in the output, or something else unexpected. Let's recalculate manually.
            *   Comparing Input 2 and Expected 2: Find coordinates (r, c) where `Input[r,c] != 0` and `Input[r,c] != Expected[r,c]`.
                *   (2,8): Input=0, Expected=1. Doesn't count.
                *   (2,9): Input=0, Expected=1. Doesn't count.
                *   (2,10): Input=2, Expected=2. Doesn't count.
                *   (2,11): Input=0, Expected=1. Doesn't count.
                *   (11,2): Input=0, Expected=1. Doesn't count.
                *   (11,8): Input=0, Expected=1. Doesn't count.
                *   (11,10): Input=3, Expected=3. Doesn't count.
                *   (11,11): Input=2, Expected=2. Doesn't count.
                *   (11,12): Input=3, Expected=3. Doesn't count.
            *   There seem to be *zero* non-white pixels changing in Example 2. The metric calculation might be flawed or comparing intermediate results incorrectly. Let's focus on the core observation: white pixels become blue.
        *   Ex 4: Input (3,4)=2, (3,6)=2, (8,4)=2, (8,6)=2, (14,4)=2, (14,6)=2, (14,10)=2, (14,12)=2. Output (3,4)=1, (3,6)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,6)=1, (14,4)=1, (14,6)=1, (14,10)=1, (14,12)=1. Yes, eight red (2) pixels changed to blue (1).

4.  **Correction to Initial Hypothesis:** The transformation is *not* just filling enclosed white pixels. In Examples 1, 2, and 4, some non-white pixels (specifically red=2) *also* change to blue (1). Which red pixels change?
    *   Ex 1: (6,4) and (6,6). These are red pixels adjacent to the enclosed white region being filled.
    *   Ex 2: Re-examining Ex 2 Output:
        
```
        ...
        1 1 3 2 3 1 1 1 1 2 1 1  <- Row 2
        ...
        1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 3 2 3 1  <- Row 11
        ...
        ```

        Compare to input:
        
```
        ...
        0 0 3 2 3 0 0 0 0 2 0 0  <- Row 2
        ...
        0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 3 2 3 0  <- Row 11
        ...
        ```

        Okay, my previous check was wrong.
        *   (2,3) input=2, output=2. NO CHANGE.
        *   (2,9) input=2, output=2. NO CHANGE.
        *   (11,3) input=2, output=2. NO CHANGE.
        *   (11,10) input=3, output=3. NO CHANGE.
        *   (11,11) input=2, output=2. NO CHANGE.
        *   (11,12) input=3, output=3. NO CHANGE.
        It seems *no* non-white pixels change in Example 2. The metric `Non-White Pixels Changed: 4` seems incorrect for this example. Let's trust visual inspection.
    *   Ex 3: No non-white pixels change.
    *   Ex 4: (3,4), (3,6), (8,4), (8,6), (14,4), (14,6), (14,10), (14,12). All are red=2. Where are they relative to the filled areas? They are adjacent to the newly filled blue areas.

5.  **Revised Hypothesis:**
    1.  Identify all white (0) pixels that are *not* connected to the border via a path of only white pixels. Let's call these "enclosed white pixels".
    2.  Create the output grid initially as a copy of the input grid.
    3.  Change all "enclosed white pixels" in the output grid to blue (1).
    4.  Identify all red (2) pixels in the input grid that are adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally?) to any of the "enclosed white pixels" identified in step 1.
    5.  Change these specific red (2) pixels in the output grid to blue (1).

6.  **Check Revised Hypothesis:**
    *   Ex 1: White pixels like (3,5) are enclosed. Red pixels (6,4) and (6,6) are adjacent to the enclosed white region around (7,4)-(7,6). This fits. Adjacency seems to be orthogonal or diagonal. (6,4) is adjacent to (7,4). (6,6) is adjacent to (7,6).
    *   Ex 2: Only enclosed white pixels change. No red pixels are adjacent? Let's see. The filled region at the top right is (1,8)-(1,10), (2,8), (2,10), (3,8)-(3,10). Are there adjacent red pixels? Yes, (2,9)=2. But (2,9) does *not* change to blue in the output. Why not? What's different about Ex 1 and Ex 4?
    *   Ex 3: Only enclosed white pixels change. Are there adjacent red pixels? Yes, (6,4)=2 is adjacent to (7,3)=1 (originally 0). But (6,4) does not change.
    *   Ex 4: Red pixels (3,4), (3,6) are adjacent to enclosed white pixels like (2,4). Red pixels (8,4), (8,6) are adjacent to enclosed white pixels like (7,4). Red pixels (14,4), (14,6), (14,10), (14,12) are adjacent to enclosed white pixels. This fits.

7.  **Re-Revising Hypothesis:** Why do adjacent red pixels change in Ex 1 and 4 but not Ex 2 and 3?
    *   Look at the red objects. In Ex 1 and 4, the red pixels that change are part of larger horizontal red lines. In Ex 2 and 3, the red pixels that *don't* change are part of vertical red lines or single points within green shapes.
    *   Maybe the rule is specific to red pixels that are part of a horizontal line of red pixels of length >= 2?
        *   Ex 1: Pixels (6,4) and (6,6) are part of the line (6,0) to (6,9), all red=2. This line has length 10. Fits.
        *   Ex 4: Pixels (3,4), (3,6) are part of line (3,0) to (3,13). Length 14. Fits. Pixels (8,4), (8,6) are part of line (8,0) to (8,13). Length 14. Fits. Pixels (14,4), (14,6) are part of line (14,0) to (14,13). Length 14. Fits. Pixels (14,10), (14,12) are also part of that line. Fits.
        *   Ex 2: Pixel (2,9)=2 is part of a vertical line of 2s from (0,9) to (14,9). Not horizontal. Doesn't change. Fits.
        *   Ex 3: Pixel (6,4)=2 is part of a vertical line from (0,4) to (11,4). Not horizontal. Doesn't change. Fits.

8.  **Final (?) Hypothesis:**
    1.  Identify all white (0) pixels not connected to the border via a path of only white pixels ("enclosed white pixels"). Use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) for the path check.
    2.  Find all red (2) pixels that belong to a horizontal contiguous segment of red pixels of length 2 or more.
    3.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input.
    4.  Change all "enclosed white pixels" to blue (1) in the output grid.
    5.  Change any red pixel identified in step 2 that is adjacent (using 8-connectivity - including diagonals) to any "enclosed white pixel" (from step 1) to blue (1) in the output grid.

This seems to cover all cases observed. The BFS approach for step 1 is still valid, assuming it can be implemented correctly. Steps 2, 4, and 5 need careful implementation.

## General Assessment

The previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying enclosed white regions (pixels with value 0) using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the border and filling these regions with blue (pixel value 1). The results clearly show this approach failed, as the transformed output was identical to the input in all test cases, meaning no pixels were changed to blue.

Analysis of the expected outputs compared to the inputs reveals two key transformation components:
1.  **Filling Enclosed White Regions:** White pixels (0) that are not reachable from the grid border via a path of only white pixels are changed to blue (1). This matches the original intent.
2.  **Changing Specific Red Pixels:** In some examples (1 and 4), certain red pixels (2) are also changed to blue (1). These changing red pixels appear to be part of horizontal red lines (contiguous sequences of red pixels horizontally) and are adjacent (including diagonals) to the white pixels that were filled in step 1. Red pixels that are part of vertical lines or are not adjacent to newly filled areas do not change.

The failure of the previous code suggests either a flaw in the BFS implementation (incorrectly marking enclosed areas as reachable) or an issue in applying the results of the BFS. The strategy moving forward is to implement the revised two-part hypothesis, ensuring the BFS correctly identifies unreachable white pixels and then applying the conditional change to adjacent horizontal red line pixels.

observations:
  - task: Fill enclosed areas and modify specific adjacent pixels.
  - grid_properties:
      - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
      - The background color is typically white (0).
      - Objects are primarily composed of red (2) and green (3) pixels.
      - Blue (1) is introduced in the output grid.
  - objects:

      - Green Pixels (3): Form shapes, often enclosing white pixels alongside red pixels.
  - actions:
      - Identify white pixels: Distinguish between those connected to the border via white paths (using 4-connectivity) and those that are not (enclosed).
      - Identify specific red pixels: Locate red pixels that are part of a contiguous horizontal sequence of at least two red pixels.
      - Modify pixels (Color Change):
          - Change all enclosed white pixels to blue (1).
          - Change specific red pixels (identified above) to blue (1) IF they are adjacent (using 8-connectivity, including diagonals) to any of the enclosed white pixels (which are now blue).
      - Preserve pixels: All other pixels (border-connected white, non-adjacent red, vertical-line red, green, etc.) retain their original color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  **Identify Border-Connected White Pixels:** Perform a flood fill (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) starting from all white (0) pixels located on the border of the input grid. Mark all reachable white pixels using only paths of white pixels (using 4-directional adjacency: up, down, left, right).
3.  **Identify Enclosed White Pixels:** Iterate through the input grid. Any pixel that is white (0) but was *not* marked as reachable in Step 2 is an "enclosed white pixel". Keep track of the coordinates of all such pixels.
4.  **Fill Enclosed White Pixels:** Change the color of all identified "enclosed white pixels" in the output grid to blue (1).
5.  **Identify Candidate Red Pixels:** Iterate through the input grid. Identify all red (2) pixels that are part of a contiguous horizontal segment of red pixels of length 2 or more. Store the coordinates of these candidate red pixels.
6.  **Identify Adjacent Red Pixels to Change:** Iterate through the candidate red pixels identified in Step 5. For each candidate red pixel, check its 8 neighbors (including diagonals) in the input grid. If any neighbor is an "enclosed white pixel" (identified in Step 3), then mark this red pixel for changing.
7.  **Change Adjacent Red Pixels:** Change the color of all red pixels marked in Step 6 to blue (1) in the output grid.
8.  **Return Output:** The final modified output grid is the result.## General Assessment

The previous code failed because it only implemented part of the required transformation. While it correctly identified the *intent* to fill enclosed white regions, it failed to execute this correctly (resulting in no changes) and missed a secondary rule involving changing specific red pixels.

Analysis of the input-output pairs reveals a two-part transformation:
1.  **Filling Enclosed White Regions:** White pixels (0) not connected to the border via a path of other white pixels are changed to blue (1).
2.  **Modifying Adjacent Red Pixels:** Red pixels (2) that are part of a horizontal line (length >= 2) and are adjacent (8-connectivity, including diagonals) to any of the newly filled blue pixels (originally enclosed white pixels) are also changed to blue (1).

The previous code's failure to change *any* pixels suggests a potential bug in the reachability algorithm (BFS) or its application, preventing it from correctly identifying enclosed pixels. The strategy is to re-implement the logic based on the refined understanding, ensuring both the enclosed white fill and the conditional red pixel modification are handled correctly.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  **Find Reachable White Pixels:** Identify all white (0) pixels connected to the border via a 4-directionally connected path of only white pixels. A Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all border white pixels is suitable. Maintain a boolean grid `is_reachable` marking these pixels as `True`.
3.  **Identify Enclosed White Pixel Coordinates:** Iterate through the input grid. Collect the coordinates `(r, c)` of all pixels where `input_grid[r, c] == 0` and `is_reachable[r, c]` is `False`. Store these coordinates in a set `enclosed_white_coords`.
4.  **Fill Enclosed White Regions:** Iterate through the `enclosed_white_coords`. For each coordinate `(r, c)` in the set, set `output_grid[r, c] = 1` (blue).
5.  **Identify Red Pixels to Change:** Initialize an empty set `red_pixels_to_change_coords`. Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid:
    a.  Check if `input_grid[r, c] == 2` (red).
    b.  If it is red, check if it's part of a horizontal segment of red pixels of length at least 2 (i.e., check if `input_grid[r, c-1] == 2` or `input_grid[r, c+1] == 2`, handling boundary conditions).
    c.  If it meets criteria (a) and (b), check its 8 neighbors (including diagonals). If any neighbor's coordinates `(nr, nc)` are present in the `enclosed_white_coords` set (from Step 3), add the current red pixel's coordinates `(r, c)` to the `red_pixels_to_change_coords` set and stop checking neighbors for this pixel.
6.  **Change Designated Red Pixels:** Iterate through the `red_pixels_to_change_coords` set. For each coordinate `(r, c)` in the set, set `output_grid[r, c] = 1` (blue).
7.  **Return Final Grid:** Return the modified `output_grid`.
