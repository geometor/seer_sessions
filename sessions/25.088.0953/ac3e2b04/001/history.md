*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids contain patterns made of red (2) and green (3) pixels against a white (0) background.
    *   The green pixels consistently form a 3x3 'H' shape (a 3x3 block with the center pixel removed or replaced). In some examples, the center pixel of the 'H' is red.
    *   The red pixels often form lines or rectangles, frequently adjacent to or encompassing the green 'H' shape.
    *   The output grids are identical to the input grids, except some white (0) pixels are changed to blue (1).
    *   The blue (1) pixels appear exclusively in areas that were originally white (0) and seem to be "contained" or "enclosed" by the combined structure of red and green pixels.
    *   The task appears to involve identifying enclosed white regions and filling them with blue.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - type: grid
        description: Input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels (0-9).
      - type: pixel
        color: white (0)
        role: Background, potentially fillable area.
      - type: pixel
        color: red (2)
        role: Forms part of boundary structures.
      - type: pixel
        color: green (3)
        role: Forms part of boundary structures, often in an 'H' pattern.
      - type: pixel
        color: blue (1)
        role: Fills enclosed white regions in the output.
    relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: Red and green pixels form contiguous boundaries.
      - type: enclosure
        description: Structures formed by red and green pixels enclose regions of white pixels. White pixels are considered enclosed if they cannot reach the grid border without crossing a non-white pixel.
    actions:
      - type: identify
        target: Regions of white pixels.
      - type: check_property
        property: enclosure
        description: Determine if a white region is fully surrounded by non-white (red or green) pixels.
      - type: modify_pixel
        source_color: white (0)
        target_color: blue (1)
        condition: The white pixel belongs to an enclosed region.
      - type: copy_pixel
        condition: Pixel is not white or is part of a non-enclosed white region. Its color remains unchanged.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all contiguous regions consisting solely of white (0) pixels in the input grid.
    2.  For each identified white region:
        a.  Check if the region is fully enclosed by non-white pixels (red (2) or green (3)). A region is considered enclosed if a path cannot be traced from any pixel within the region to any pixel on the border of the grid using only adjacent (horizontal or vertical) white pixels.
        b.  If the white region is fully enclosed, change the color of all pixels within that region to blue (1) in the output grid.
    3.  All pixels that are not part of an enclosed white region (i.e., all red, green, and non-enclosed white pixels) retain their original color from the input grid in the output grid.
