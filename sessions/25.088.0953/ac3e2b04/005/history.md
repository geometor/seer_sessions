Transforms the input grid based on two main rules:

2. Changes specific adjacent red pixels: Red pixels (2) that are part of a horizontal line segment of length 2 or more AND are adjacent (using 8-directional adjacency, including diagonals) to any of the enclosed white pixels (identified in rule 1) are also changed to blue (1).
All other pixels retain their original color.

## General Assessment

The provided code attempted to implement a two-part transformation: filling enclosed white areas and changing adjacent red pixels. However, it failed on all examples, producing outputs identical to the inputs (except for metadata changes).

The core issues appear to be:
1.  **Incorrect Identification/Filling of White Pixels:** The logic to identify "enclosed" white pixels (those not reachable from the border via a path of only white pixels) might have been implemented, but the subsequent steps failed to use this information correctly, resulting in no white pixels changing color.
2.  **Incorrect Condition for Changing Red Pixels:** The code checked for red pixels in horizontal lines of length 2+ that were adjacent to the *original coordinates* of the enclosed white pixels. The examples show that:
    *   Red pixels adjacent to the *newly blue* pixels (that were formerly white) should change.
    *   The adjacency check should use 8 directions (including diagonals).
    *   The condition that the red pixel must be part of a horizontal segment is incorrect; vertical segments and even single red pixels change if they are adjacent to the newly blue pixels.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Correct White Pixel Filling:** Implement the BFS/DFS from the border correctly to identify all white pixels reachable via 4-directional movement through white paths. Mark all *other* white pixels as "enclosed" or "interior". Create an intermediate grid where these interior white pixels are changed to blue (1). Keep track of the coordinates of these newly blue pixels.
2.  **Correct Red Pixel Changing:** Iterate through the *original* input grid. For each red pixel (2), check its 8 neighbors. If any neighbor's coordinates match those of a pixel that was changed from white to blue in the previous step, mark this red pixel for change.
3.  **Final Grid Construction:** Create the final output grid by taking the intermediate grid (with white->blue changes) and changing the marked red pixels to blue (1).
