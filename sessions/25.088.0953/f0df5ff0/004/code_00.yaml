task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D numpy array of integers (0-9).
  color_map: Standard ARC colors (0: white, 1: blue, 2-9: other colors).
  connectivity: 8-way adjacency (including diagonals).

input_objects:
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value 0-9
      - location: (row, column) coordinate
  - object: region
    properties:
      - type: contiguous area of pixels with the same color
      - color: the color of the pixels in the region
      - pixels: set of (row, column) coordinates belonging to the region
      - enclosed: boolean, true if no pixel in the region is on the grid border (row=0, col=0, row=max_row, col=max_col)

initial_state_facts:
  - Multiple regions of different colors exist in the input grid.
  - Some regions consist of white (0) pixels.
  - Some regions consist of blue (1) pixels (can be single pixels or larger regions).
  - Other regions consist of colors 2-9, acting as potential boundaries.
  - Some white regions may be fully enclosed by non-white pixels.
  - Some white regions may touch the grid border.
  - Some enclosed white regions may contain one or more blue pixels.
  - Some enclosed white regions may not contain any blue pixels.
  - Some blue pixels may be located within enclosed white regions.
  - Some blue pixels may be located within white regions connected to the border.
  - Some blue pixels may be adjacent to non-white pixels.

actions:
  - identify: Find all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels.
  - check_enclosure: For each white region, determine if it is enclosed (does not touch the grid border).
  - check_containment: For each enclosed white region, determine if it contains at least one initial blue (1) pixel.
  - fill: If an enclosed white region contains an initial blue pixel, change the color of all pixels within that region from white (0) to blue (1).

final_state_facts:
  - Pixels that were initially colors 2-9 remain unchanged.
  - Pixels that were initially blue (1) remain unchanged.
  - White (0) pixels belonging to enclosed regions that contained at least one initial blue pixel are changed to blue (1).
  - All other white (0) pixels (in non-enclosed regions, or in enclosed regions without an initial blue pixel) remain white (0).
