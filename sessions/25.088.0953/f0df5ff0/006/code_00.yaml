task_description: Fill white areas connected to initial blue pixels with blue.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  color_palette: 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
  shape: variable (up to 30x30)

objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      location: (row, column)
  - type: region
    properties:
      color: single integer (e.g., all 0 for white, all 1 for blue)
      contiguity: adjacent pixels (8-way connectivity) of the same color
      pixels: list of (row, column) coordinates

input_features:
  - initial_blue_pixels: All pixels with color 1 in the input grid.
  - white_pixels: All pixels with color 0 in the input grid.
  - barrier_pixels: All pixels with color > 1 in the input grid.

actions:
  - name: identify_sources
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates of all initial_blue_pixels
  - name: flood_fill
    sources: initial_blue_pixels
    fillable_area: white_pixels (color 0)
    barriers: barrier_pixels (color > 1) and grid boundaries
    connectivity: 8-way (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
    effect: changes the color of reachable white_pixels to blue (1)

output_specification:
  - Retain the color and location of all barrier_pixels from the input grid.
  - Retain the color (blue, 1) and location of all initial_blue_pixels.
  - Change the color of all white_pixels reachable via flood_fill from initial_blue_pixels to blue (1).
  - Retain the color (white, 0) of all white_pixels *not* reachable via flood_fill from initial_blue_pixels.
