Existing non-white, non-blue pixels remain unchanged. Existing blue pixels also remain unchanged.\n4.  **Spatial Pattern:** The new 'blue' pixels appear to \"grow\" or \"spread\" outwards from the locations of the *original* 'blue' pixels present in the input grid. This spreading seems to fill adjacent 'white' (0) areas.\n5.  **Connectivity:** The spreading appears to consider diagonal adjacency (8-connectivity). A 'white' pixel changes to 'blue' if it is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a pixel that was either originally 'blue' or has just been changed to 'blue' as part of the spreading process.\n6.  **Boundaries:** The spreading stops when it encounters any non-'white' pixel. These non-white pixels act as barriers.\n7.  **Mechanism:** This behavior strongly suggests a flood fill algorithm (specifically, breadth-first search is suitable) starting from all initial 'blue' pixels and filling only 'white' pixels.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
