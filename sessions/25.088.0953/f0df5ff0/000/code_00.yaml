task_description: "Fill connected white areas starting from existing blue pixels."
grid_properties:
  size: "Consistent 15x15 for input and output in examples."
  color_palette: "Uses colors 0-9."
objects:
  - object_type: "pixel"
    properties:
      - color: "Integer value 0-9, corresponding to specific colors (white, blue, red, etc.)."
      - location: "Row and column index."
  - object_type: "region"
    properties:
      - type: "connected_area"
      - color: "Typically refers to contiguous areas of 'white' (0)."
  - object_type: "source_pixel"
    properties:
      - color: "blue" # value 1
      - role: "Starting point for the fill operation."
actions:
  - action: "flood_fill"
    parameters:
      - start_points: "All pixels with color 'blue' (1) in the input grid."
      - target_color: "white" # value 0
      - fill_color: "blue" # value 1
      - connectivity: "8-way (includes diagonals)."
    constraints:
      - "Fill only propagates through 'white' pixels."
      - "Non-'white' pixels act as boundaries and are not changed."
relationships:
  - relationship: "adjacency"
    entities: ["pixel", "pixel"]
    type: "8-connectivity (horizontal, vertical, diagonal neighbors)."
  - relationship: "containment"
    entities: ["region", "pixel"]
    description: "A region consists of multiple connected pixels of the same color."
transformation_rule:
  - "Identify all 'blue' (1) pixels in the input grid."
  - "Perform an 8-connected flood fill starting from these initial blue pixels."
  - "The fill process changes adjacent 'white' (0) pixels to 'blue' (1)."
  - "The fill stops at grid boundaries or any non-'white' pixel."
  - "All other pixels retain their original color."
