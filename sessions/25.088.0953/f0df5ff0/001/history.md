Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for Task `train_1`.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Size:** The input and output grids are consistently 15x15 in all training examples.
2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use various colors (0-9), but the core transformation seems to involve only 'white' (0) and 'blue' (1).
3.  **Transformation:** The primary change between the input and output grids is the appearance of new 'blue' (1) pixels in the output where 'white' (0) pixels existed in the input. Existing non-white, non-blue pixels remain unchanged. Existing blue pixels also remain unchanged.
4.  **Spatial Pattern:** The new 'blue' pixels appear to "grow" or "spread" outwards from the locations of the *original* 'blue' pixels present in the input grid. This spreading seems to fill adjacent 'white' (0) areas.
5.  **Connectivity:** The spreading appears to consider diagonal adjacency (8-connectivity). A 'white' pixel changes to 'blue' if it is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a pixel that was either originally 'blue' or has just been changed to 'blue' as part of the spreading process.
6.  **Boundaries:** The spreading stops when it encounters any non-'white' pixel. These non-white pixels act as barriers.
7.  **Mechanism:** This behavior strongly suggests a flood fill algorithm (specifically, breadth-first search is suitable) starting from all initial 'blue' pixels and filling only 'white' pixels.

**Facts**

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the working grid for the output.
2.  Initialize a queue (FIFO data structure) to store the coordinates `(row, column)` of pixels to process.
3.  Iterate through every cell of the input grid. If a cell at `(row, column)` contains the color 'blue' (value 1), add its coordinates `(row, column)` to the queue.
4.  While the queue is not empty:
    a.  Remove the coordinates `(currentRow, currentCol)` from the front of the queue.
    b.  Examine the 8 neighboring cells (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) around `(currentRow, currentCol)`.
    c.  For each neighbor at `(neighborRow, neighborCol)`:
        i.  Check if `(neighborRow, neighborCol)` is within the bounds of the grid.
        ii. Check if the color of the cell at `(neighborRow, neighborCol)` in the *working grid* is 'white' (value 0).
        iii. If both conditions (within bounds and is 'white') are true:
            *   Change the color of the cell at `(neighborRow, neighborCol)` in the working grid to 'blue' (value 1).
            *   Add the coordinates `(neighborRow, neighborCol)` to the back of the queue.
5.  Once the queue is empty, the working grid contains the final output. Return the working grid.
