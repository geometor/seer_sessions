## General Assessment

The provided Python code implements an 8-connected flood fill starting from all blue (1) pixels and expanding into adjacent white (0) pixels. Non-white, non-blue pixels (2-9) act as boundaries for the fill propagation. However, the results show this logic is incorrect. The transformed outputs consistently overfill white areas compared to the expected outputs across all three examples.

The core issue seems to be that the flood fill in the code propagates into *any* reachable white pixel, regardless of whether that white area is globally enclosed or connected to the grid boundary. The expected outputs suggest the fill should be restricted only to **enclosed regions** of white pixels that contain at least one initial blue pixel. White areas connected to the grid's edge are never filled, even if they are adjacent to an initial blue pixel.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze the examples to confirm the "enclosed region" hypothesis. We will focus on the connectivity of white areas (0) and the placement of initial blue pixels (1).

**Example 1:**
*   **Input:** Contains 4 initial blue pixels. Contains multiple distinct regions of white pixels.
*   **Expected Output:** Blue pixels appear in four distinct areas, each corresponding to one of the initial blue pixels. Crucially, these filled areas appear visually enclosed by other colors (2-9). White pixels near the border or in regions connected to the border remain white.
*   **Transformed Output:** Almost all white pixels are turned blue. This confirms the code's flood fill escapes the intended enclosed areas.
*   **Conclusion:** The fill should only occur within white regions completely surrounded by non-white pixels (2-9) and containing an initial blue pixel.

**Example 2:**
*   **Input:** Contains 5 initial blue pixels. Contains various white regions.
*   **Expected Output:** Blue pixels appear in five distinct areas, again seemingly corresponding to enclosed white regions containing the initial blue pixels. White areas connected to the border (e.g., top-left, top-right) are not filled.
*   **Transformed Output:** Most white pixels are turned blue, ignoring the enclosure requirement.
*   **Conclusion:** Reinforces the "enclosed region" hypothesis.

**Example 3:**
*   **Input:** Contains 5 initial blue pixels. Contains complex white regions.
*   **Expected Output:** Blue pixels appear around the initial blue pixels, limited to what look like enclosed white areas. White pixels in areas connected to the grid border (e.g., top edge, left edge) remain white.
*   **Transformed Output:** Most white pixels are turned blue.
*   **Conclusion:** Consistent with the "enclosed region" hypothesis.

**Summary of Observation:** The key factor is whether a region of white pixels is 'enclosed'. An enclosed region is one that does not touch the boundary of the grid. If a region of white pixels is enclosed AND contains at least one initial blue pixel, then ALL white pixels within that specific region are changed to blue. Otherwise, white pixels remain white, and all other pixels (including initial blue ones) remain unchanged.

## YAML Fact Documentation


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D numpy array of integers (0-9).
  color_map: Standard ARC colors (0: white, 1: blue, 2-9: other colors).
  connectivity: 8-way adjacency (including diagonals).

input_objects:
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value 0-9
      - location: (row, column) coordinate
  - object: region
    properties:
      - type: contiguous area of pixels with the same color
      - color: the color of the pixels in the region
      - pixels: set of (row, column) coordinates belonging to the region
      - enclosed: boolean, true if no pixel in the region is on the grid border (row=0, col=0, row=max_row, col=max_col)

initial_state_facts:
  - Multiple regions of different colors exist in the input grid.
  - Some regions consist of white (0) pixels.
  - Some regions consist of blue (1) pixels (can be single pixels or larger regions).
  - Other regions consist of colors 2-9, acting as potential boundaries.
  - Some white regions may be fully enclosed by non-white pixels.
  - Some white regions may touch the grid border.
  - Some enclosed white regions may contain one or more blue pixels.
  - Some enclosed white regions may not contain any blue pixels.
  - Some blue pixels may be located within enclosed white regions.
  - Some blue pixels may be located within white regions connected to the border.
  - Some blue pixels may be adjacent to non-white pixels.

actions:
  - identify: Find all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels.
  - check_enclosure: For each white region, determine if it is enclosed (does not touch the grid border).
  - check_containment: For each enclosed white region, determine if it contains at least one initial blue (1) pixel.
  - fill: If an enclosed white region contains an initial blue pixel, change the color of all pixels within that region from white (0) to blue (1).

final_state_facts:
  - Pixels that were initially colors 2-9 remain unchanged.
  - Pixels that were initially blue (1) remain unchanged.
  - White (0) pixels belonging to enclosed regions that contained at least one initial blue pixel are changed to blue (1).
  - All other white (0) pixels (in non-enclosed regions, or in enclosed regions without an initial blue pixel) remain white (0).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous regions of white (0) pixels in the input grid using 8-way connectivity.
3.  For each identified white region:
    a.  Determine if the region is "enclosed" by checking if *none* of its constituent pixels are located on the border of the grid (i.e., row 0, column 0, last row, or last column).
    b.  If the region is enclosed, check if it contains at least one pixel that was blue (1) in the *original input grid*.
    c.  If the region is both enclosed and contains an initial blue pixel, then change the color of *all* pixels belonging to this region in the *output grid* from white (0) to blue (1).
4.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged from their initial input values (including initial blue pixels and boundary colors 2-9).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
