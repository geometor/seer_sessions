"""
Transforms the input grid by performing a flood fill operation starting from all initial blue pixels (color 1). 
The fill propagates through adjacent (8-way connectivity, including diagonals) white pixels (color 0). 
Any white pixel reachable from an initial blue pixel via a path of white pixels is changed to blue (1) in the output grid. 
All other pixels (initial blue pixels, barrier pixels with colors 2-9, and unreachable white pixels) retain their original colors.
