task_description: "Fill connected white areas adjacent to initial blue pixels with blue, treating all other colors as boundaries."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  value_range: 0-9
  value_semantics: color_map
objects:
  - object_type: region
    color: 1 # blue
    role: source # Starting points for the fill
  - object_type: region
    color: 0 # white
    role: target # Areas potentially filled with blue
  - object_type: region
    color: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon
    role: boundary # Impassable barriers for the fill
actions:
  - action: flood_fill
    source_color: 1 # blue
    target_color: 0 # white
    fill_color: 1 # blue
    connectivity: 8 # includes diagonals
    boundary_colors: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # All non-white, non-blue colors
    termination_condition: "Fill stops when no more white pixels adjacent (8-connectivity) to blue pixels (either initial or newly filled) can be reached without crossing a boundary color."
state_changes:
  - description: "White pixels connected (via 8-connectivity, through other white pixels only) to an initial blue pixel are changed to blue."
  - description: "Initial blue pixels remain blue."
  - description: "Pixels with boundary colors remain unchanged."
constraints:
  - "The fill must originate from a blue pixel."
  - "The fill can only spread into white pixels."
  - "The fill cannot spread across or into pixels of boundary colors (2-9)."
