            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains a prominent rectangular frame made of blue pixels (color 1). Inside this frame is an area filled with white pixels (color 0). Outside the frame, typically in the top-left corner region, there are isolated, non-white pixels. The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid largely mirrors the input grid, but the white area inside the blue frame is filled with colors. The blue frame itself and the pixels outside the frame remain unchanged.\n3.  **Color Filling:** The filling pattern within the frame follows concentric layers, moving inwards from the blue boundary.\n4.  **Color Source:** The colors used for filling originate from the isolated, non-white pixels found outside the blue frame in the input grid. Specifically, pixels located at diagonal positions `(d, d)` (where `d` starts from 0) seem to determine the colors.\n5.  **Relationship:** There's a direct mapping between the position of the external \"key\" pixels and the layer they color inside the frame. The key pixel at `(0, 0)` determines the color for the layer immediately inside the blue frame. The key pixel at `(1, 1)` determines the color for the next layer inwards, and so on.\n6.  **Distance Metric:** The layers inside the frame can be defined by their minimum distance to the surrounding blue frame boundary. A pixel's distance `dist` is `min(row_distance_to_top_frame, row_distance_to_bottom_frame, col_distance_to_left_frame, col_distance_to_right_frame)`. The layer with `dist = 1` is colored by the key pixel at `(0, 0)`, the layer with `dist = 2` is colored by the key pixel at `(1, 1)`, and generally, the layer with distance `dist` is colored by the key pixel at `(dist-1, dist-1)`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Record its minimum and maximum row and column indices (`frame_r_min`, `frame_c_min`, `frame_r_max`, `frame_c_max`).\n2.  **Find Key Colors:** Create a list or map to store the colors of the \"key\" pixels found at diagonal coordinates `(d, d)` in the input grid, starting from `d=0`, for as long as these coordinates are valid within the grid dimensions and are outside the identified blue frame. Store the color found at `(d, d)` associated with the index `d`.\n3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.\n4.  **Fill Inner Area:** Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` within the region strictly inside the blue frame (i.e., `frame_r_min < r < frame_r_max` and `frame_c_min < c < frame_c_max`).\n5.  **Check if Fillable:** For each such pixel `(r, c)`, check if its color in the input grid is white (0).\n6.  **Calculate Distance:** If the pixel is white, calculate its minimum distance `dist` to the blue frame boundary: `dist = min(r - frame_r_min, frame_r_max - r, c - frame_c_min, frame_c_max - c)`.\n7.  **Determine Fill Color:** Use the calculated distance `dist` to find the appropriate key color. The color is the one associated with index `d = dist - 1` found in step 2.\n8.  **Apply Color:** Change the color of the pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid to the determined fill color.\n9.  **Final Output:** The modified grid after iterating through all pixels inside the frame is the final output. Pixels belonging to the frame or located outside the frame remain unchanged from the input."
