"""
Fill the white interior of a blue rectangular frame with concentric colored layers. 
The layer colors are determined by a sequence of key colors found on the main 
diagonal of the grid, starting from the top-left corner (0,0). Pixels outside
the frame, the frame itself, and non-white pixels inside the frame remain unchanged.

If the calculated distance from the frame for a pixel maps to an index beyond 
the available key colors, the color corresponding to the *last* key color is used 
for that layer and any subsequent inner layers.

The process involves:
1. Identifying the blue (1) frame boundaries.
2. Extracting key colors from the diagonal (d, d), stopping at white (0), blue (1), or grid edge.
3. Calculating the minimum distance (Chebyshev distance) of each white pixel inside the frame to the frame boundary.
4. Mapping this distance (minus 1) to an index in the key colors list to determine the fill color.
5. If the calculated index is out of bounds (too large), clamp it to the last valid index of the key colors list.
