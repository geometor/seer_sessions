"""
Fill the white interior of a blue rectangular frame with concentric colored layers.
The layer colors are determined by a sequence of key colors found on the main 
diagonal of the grid, starting from the top-left corner (0,0). Pixels outside
the frame, the frame itself, and non-white pixels inside the frame remain unchanged.

The process involves:
1. Identifying the blue (1) frame boundaries.
2. Extracting key colors from the diagonal (d, d), stopping at white (0), blue (1), or grid edge.
3. Calculating the minimum distance of each white pixel inside the frame to the frame boundary.
4. Mapping this distance (minus 1) to an index in the key colors list to determine the fill color.

Okay, the error location reported in the initial problem description was wrong. The code output shows the mismatch at `(7, 7)`, not `(8, 8)`.

*   Pixel `(7, 7)`:
    *   Input color: White (0)
    *   Expected output color: Yellow (4)
    *   Frame: `(3, 3)` to `(11, 11)`
    *   Key Colors: `[Red(2), Magenta(6), Yellow(4)]`
    *   Calculated distance (`dist_center`): `min(7-3, 11-7, 7-3, 11-7) = min(4, 4, 4, 4) = 4`
    *   Calculated key index (`key_index_center`): `dist - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`
    *   The `key_colors` list has indices `0, 1, 2`. Index `3` is out of bounds.
    *   The current code leaves the pixel as white (0) because the index is out of bounds.
    *   The expected color is Yellow (4), which is the *last* color in the `key_colors` list.

This suggests that if the calculated distance index exceeds the available key colors, the innermost layer(s) should use the *last* available key color, rather than defaulting to white.

Let's re-evaluate Example 1 and 3 with this hypothesis.

Example 1:
Frame: (2, 2) to (7, 7)
Key Colors: [Green(3), Red(2)]
Max distance possible inside is `min(floor((7-2-1)/2), floor((7-2-1)/2)) = min(2, 2) = 2`.
Max key index is `2 - 1 = 1`.
Key indices needed are 0 and 1. `key_colors` has length 2 (indices 0, 1). No index goes out of bounds. Hypothesis holds.

Example 3:
Frame: (4, 4) to (13, 13)
Key Colors: [Azure(8), Magenta(6), Yellow(4), Red(2)]
Max distance possible inside is `min(floor((13-4-1)/2), floor((13-13-1)/2)) = min(4, 4) = 4`.
Max key index is `4 - 1 = 3`.
Key indices needed are 0, 1, 2, 3. `key_colors` has length 4 (indices 0, 1, 2, 3). No index goes out of bounds. Hypothesis holds.

The hypothesis seems consistent: for distances whose index (`dist - 1`) would normally fall outside the bounds of the `key_colors` list, use the color corresponding to the *last* index (`len(key_colors) - 1`).

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code correctly identifies the blue frame and extracts the sequence of key colors from the diagonal. It also correctly calculates the Chebyshev distance (minimum distance to the frame boundary) for each internal pixel. The logic fails in Example 2 because the calculated distance for the centermost pixels maps to an index outside the bounds of the extracted key colors list. The code currently leaves these pixels white, whereas the expected output uses the *last* color from the key colors list for these innermost layers.

**Strategy:** Modify the color assignment logic. When calculating the `key_index = dist - 1`, if this index is greater than or equal to the length of the `key_colors` list, clamp the index to `len(key_colors) - 1` instead of skipping the pixel or leaving it white.

## Metrics

**Example 1:**
*   Input Size: 10x10
*   Frame: (2, 2) to (7, 7) (Size 6x6)
*   Key Colors: `[Green(3), Red(2)]` (Length 2)
*   Max Distance Inside Frame: 2
*   Max Key Index Needed: 1
*   Result: Success. All required indices (0, 1) are within the bounds of `key_colors`.

**Example 2:**
*   Input Size: 15x15
*   Frame: (3, 3) to (11, 11) (Size 9x9)
*   Key Colors: `[Red(2), Magenta(6), Yellow(4)]` (Length 3)
*   Max Distance Inside Frame: 4
*   Max Key Index Needed: 3
*   Result: Failure.
    *   Pixels with distance 1 (index 0) use Red(2). Correct.
    *   Pixels with distance 2 (index 1) use Magenta(6). Correct.
    *   Pixels with distance 3 (index 2) use Yellow(4). Correct.
    *   Pixel(s) with distance 4 (index 3) are left White(0) by the code. Expected output uses Yellow(4) (last key color, index 2). The incorrect pixel is at (7, 7).

**Example 3:**
*   Input Size: 15x15
*   Frame: (4, 4) to (13, 13) (Size 10x10)
*   Key Colors: `[Azure(8), Magenta(6), Yellow(4), Red(2)]` (Length 4)
*   Max Distance Inside Frame: 4
*   Max Key Index Needed: 3
*   Result: Success. All required indices (0, 1, 2, 3) are within the bounds of `key_colors`.

```yaml
Task: Fill a frame interior with concentric layers based on diagonal colors.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Objects:
      - Frame:
          - Type: Hollow rectangle.
          - Color: Blue (1).
          - Property: Defines the boundary for the fill operation.
          - Location: Variable, but always present in training examples.
      - Key_Colors_Source:
          - Type: Sequence of pixels.
          - Location: Main diagonal (r=c), starting from (0,0).
          - Termination: Sequence stops at White(0), Blue(1), or grid edge.
          - Property: Determines the colors used for filling.
      - Fillable_Area:
          - Type: Pixels within the frame.
          - Color: Initially White (0).
          - Property: Target area for the transformation.
      - Other_Pixels:
          - Type: Pixels outside the frame, the frame itself, or non-white pixels inside the frame.
          - Property: Remain unchanged in the output.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D array, modified from the input.
  - Objects:
      - Frame: Unchanged.
      - Other_Pixels: Unchanged.
      - Filled_Area:
          - Type: Pixels that were white inside the frame.
          - Color: Replaced with concentric layers of colors.
          - Pattern: Layers correspond to the distance from the frame boundary.

Actions:
  1. Identify_Frame: Locate the minimum and maximum row and column indices (r_min, c_min, r_max, c_max) of the Blue(1) pixels forming the frame.
  2. Extract_Key_Colors: Read colors from the main diagonal `grid[d, d]` starting `d=0`, stopping if the color is White(0) or Blue(1) or `d` is out of bounds. Store these colors in an ordered list `key_colors`.
  3. Iterate_Internal_Pixels: Loop through each pixel `(r, c)` such that `r_min < r < r_max` and `c_min < c < c_max`.
  4. Check_Fillability: If `input_grid[r, c]` is White(0):
      a. Calculate_Distance: Compute the minimum distance `dist` from `(r, c)` to the four sides of the frame: `dist = min(r - r_min, r_max - r, c - c_min, c_max - c)`. This is the Chebyshev distance to the boundary.
      b. Determine_Color_Index: Calculate the potential index `key_index = dist - 1`.
      c. Clamp_Index: If `key_index` is greater than or equal to `len(key_colors)`, set `key_index = len(key_colors) - 1`.
      d. Assign_Color: If `len(key_colors) > 0` and `key_index >= 0`, set `output_grid[r, c] = key_colors[key_index]`. Otherwise (no key colors found), the pixel remains White(0).
  5. Preserve_Pixels: If `input_grid[r, c]` is not White(0), or if the pixel is outside the inner frame area (i.e., on the frame or outside it), keep its original color in the output grid.

Edge_Cases:
  - No blue frame found: Return the input grid unchanged (though not observed in examples).
  - No key colors found (diagonal starts with White/Blue or is empty): Fillable area remains White(0).
  - Distance calculation results in an index beyond the available key colors: Use the last available key color for filling.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify the Blue Frame:** Find the smallest rectangular bounding box that encloses all Blue (1) pixels. Record its top-left `(r_min, c_min)` and bottom-right `(r_max, c_max)` coordinates (inclusive). If no Blue pixels exist, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  **Extract Key Colors:** Create an ordered list of 'key colors' by reading the pixels along the main diagonal of the input grid, starting from `(0, 0)`. Continue adding colors to the list as long as the diagonal coordinate `(d, d)` is within the grid bounds and the color at `grid[d, d]` is *not* White (0) and *not* Blue (1). Stop when any of these conditions are met.
3.  **Prepare Output Grid:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
4.  **Fill Interior:** Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` located strictly *inside* the blue frame (i.e., `r_min < r < r_max` and `c_min < c < c_max`).
5.  **Check and Color:** For each such internal pixel `(r, c)`:
    a.  If the color of this pixel in the *input* grid is White (0) and the list of `key_colors` is not empty:
        i.  Calculate the 'layer distance' `dist` for the pixel, defined as the minimum number of steps (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) needed to reach any part of the blue frame boundary. This is calculated as `dist = min(r - r_min, r_max - r, c - c_min, c_max - c)`.
        ii. Determine the index into the `key_colors` list by subtracting 1 from the distance: `base_index = dist - 1`.
        iii. Adjust the index if it's too large: If `base_index` is greater than or equal to the number of key colors found, use the index of the *last* key color instead (`final_index = len(key_colors) - 1`). Otherwise, use the calculated index (`final_index = base_index`).
        iv. Set the color of the pixel `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to the color found at `key_colors[final_index]`.
    b.  If the pixel `(r, c)` inside the frame was *not* White (0) in the input, or if no key colors were found, leave its color unchanged in the output grid (it was already copied).
6.  **Return Result:** Return the modified output grid. Pixels on the frame boundary and outside the frame remain unchanged throughout the process.
