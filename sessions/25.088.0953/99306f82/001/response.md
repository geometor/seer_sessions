"""
Fill the white area inside a blue rectangular frame with concentric colored layers. 
The colors and order of these layers are determined by key pixels located outside 
the frame along the main diagonal starting from the top-left corner (0,0). 
The pixel at (d, d) in the input determines the color for the layer inside the frame 
at a minimum distance of (d+1) from the frame boundary. Pixels outside the white 
inner area remain unchanged.
