Task: Fill a frame interior with concentric layers based on diagonal colors.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Objects:
      - Frame:
          - Type: Hollow rectangle.
          - Color: Blue (1).
          - Property: Defines the boundary for the fill operation.
          - Location: Variable, but always present in training examples.
      - Key_Colors_Source:
          - Type: Sequence of pixels.
          - Location: Main diagonal (r=c), starting from (0,0).
          - Termination: Sequence stops at White(0), Blue(1), or grid edge.
          - Property: Determines the colors used for filling.
      - Fillable_Area:
          - Type: Pixels within the frame.
          - Color: Initially White (0).
          - Property: Target area for the transformation.
      - Other_Pixels:
          - Type: Pixels outside the frame, the frame itself, or non-white pixels inside the frame.
          - Property: Remain unchanged in the output.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D array, modified from the input.
  - Objects:
      - Frame: Unchanged.
      - Other_Pixels: Unchanged.
      - Filled_Area:
          - Type: Pixels that were white inside the frame.
          - Color: Replaced with concentric layers of colors.
          - Pattern: Layers correspond to the distance from the frame boundary.

Actions:
  1. Identify_Frame: Locate the minimum and maximum row and column indices (r_min, c_min, r_max, c_max) of the Blue(1) pixels forming the frame.
  2. Extract_Key_Colors: Read colors from the main diagonal `grid[d, d]` starting `d=0`, stopping if the color is White(0) or Blue(1) or `d` is out of bounds. Store these colors in an ordered list `key_colors`.
  3. Iterate_Internal_Pixels: Loop through each pixel `(r, c)` such that `r_min < r < r_max` and `c_min < c < c_max`.
  4. Check_Fillability: If `input_grid[r, c]` is White(0):
      a. Calculate_Distance: Compute the minimum distance `dist` from `(r, c)` to the four sides of the frame: `dist = min(r - r_min, r_max - r, c - c_min, c_max - c)`. This is the Chebyshev distance to the boundary.
      b. Determine_Color_Index: Calculate the potential index `key_index = dist - 1`.
      c. Clamp_Index: If `key_index` is greater than or equal to `len(key_colors)`, set `key_index = len(key_colors) - 1`.
      d. Assign_Color: If `len(key_colors) > 0` and `key_index >= 0`, set `output_grid[r, c] = key_colors[key_index]`. Otherwise (no key colors found), the pixel remains White(0).
  5. Preserve_Pixels: If `input_grid[r, c]` is not White(0), or if the pixel is outside the inner frame area (i.e., on the frame or outside it), keep its original color in the output grid.

Edge_Cases:
  - No blue frame found: Return the input grid unchanged (though not observed in examples).
  - No key colors found (diagonal starts with White/Blue or is empty): Fillable area remains White(0).
  - Distance calculation results in an index beyond the available key colors: Use the last available key color for filling.
