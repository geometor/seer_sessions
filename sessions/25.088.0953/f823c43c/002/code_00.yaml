task_description: "Identify and replace pixels of a specific 'noise' color based on the surrounding context."
noise_color:
  value: 6
  name: Magenta
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      height: variable (12 to 15 in examples)
      width: variable (12 to 19 in examples)
      pixels: contains integers 0-9 representing colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      location: (row, column)
      is_noise: boolean (true if color is 6)
actions:
  - name: identify_noise_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: list of locations of pixels with color 6
  - name: determine_replacement_color
    input: input_grid
    method: calculate frequency of all non-noise colors globally
    output: the color with the highest frequency (excluding noise color 6)
  - name: replace_noise_pixels
    input: input_grid, noise_pixel_locations, replacement_color
    output: output_grid (copy of input_grid with noise pixels changed to replacement_color)
observations:
  - example_1: Replacing noise (6) with the globally most frequent non-noise color (8) correctly transforms the input to the expected output.
  - example_2: Replacing noise (6) with the globally most frequent non-noise color (7) does *not* produce the expected output. The expected output requires a selective replacement rule (some 6s become 7s, some 6s become 8s) not captured by the simple global frequency rule.
uncertainty:
  - The rule derived from Example 1 does not generalize to produce the expected output for Example 2. The true rule might be more complex (e.g., pattern-based replacement) or the expected output for Example 2 might be inconsistent with Example 1.
