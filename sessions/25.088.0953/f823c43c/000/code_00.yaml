task_description: Replace all pixels of a specific 'noise' color (Magenta=6) with the most frequent 'background' color found in the input grid (excluding the noise color).

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: height and width (variable, consistent between input and output)
      - background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid, excluding Magenta(6). (Azure=8 in train_1, Orange=7 in train_2)
      - pattern_colors: Other colors forming patterns or structures. (Yellow=4 in train_1, Azure=8 in train_2)
      - noise_color: A specific color to be removed (Magenta=6 in both examples).

actions:
  - identify_noise_color: Recognize Magenta(6) as the target color for removal.
  - identify_background_color:
      - Calculate the frequency of all colors present in the input grid.
      - Exclude the noise_color (Magenta=6) from the frequency count.
      - Determine the color with the highest remaining frequency.
  - replace_pixels:
      - Iterate through every pixel in the input grid.
      - If a pixel's color matches the noise_color, change its color in the output grid to the identified background_color.
      - Otherwise, copy the pixel's original color to the output grid.

relationships:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - All pixels retain their original color unless they match the noise_color.
  - Pixels matching the noise_color are replaced by the background_color.
