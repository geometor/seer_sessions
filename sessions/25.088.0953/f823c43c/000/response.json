Azure (8) seems to be the dominant or \"background\" color.\n\n**Example 2 (train_2):**\n*   The input grid has dimensions 12x12.\n*   The primary colors are Orange (7) and Azure (8). Orange (7) acts as a background. Azure (8) pixels appear in columns (indices 1, 4, 7, 10).\n*   There are sporadic occurrences of Magenta (6) pixels scattered within the grid.\n*   The output grid has the same dimensions (12x12).\n*   The output grid retains the Orange (7) background and the Azure (8) column structure.\n*   All Magenta (6) pixels present in the input have been replaced in the output.\n*   Observing the replacement locations, it appears that Magenta (6) pixels are consistently replaced by Orange (7) pixels, even if the Magenta pixel was located in a position typically occupied by Azure (8) (e.g., Input[1, 4]=6 becomes Output[1, 4]=7). Orange (7) is the dominant or \"background\" color in this example.\n\n**Overall Pattern:**\nIn both examples, there's a color (Magenta=6) that seems to act as \"noise\" or an unwanted element. This \"noise\" color is removed and replaced by the most frequent color in the input grid (excluding the noise color itself).\n\n## Facts YAML\n\n"
