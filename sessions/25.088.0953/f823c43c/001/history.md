Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

**Example 1 (train_1):**
*   The input grid has dimensions 15x19.
*   The primary colors are Azure (8) and Yellow (4), forming a pattern where rows alternate between mostly Azure and an Azure-Yellow checkerboard/stripe pattern.
*   There are sporadic occurrences of Magenta (6) pixels scattered within the grid.
*   The output grid has the same dimensions (15x19).
*   The output grid retains the Azure (8) and Yellow (4) pattern structure.
*   All Magenta (6) pixels present in the input have been replaced in the output.
*   Observing the replacement locations, it appears that Magenta (6) pixels are consistently replaced by Azure (8) pixels, regardless of whether the original location was expected to be Azure (8) or Yellow (4) based on the row pattern. Azure (8) seems to be the dominant or "background" color.

**Example 2 (train_2):**
*   The input grid has dimensions 12x12.
*   The primary colors are Orange (7) and Azure (8). Orange (7) acts as a background. Azure (8) pixels appear in columns (indices 1, 4, 7, 10).
*   There are sporadic occurrences of Magenta (6) pixels scattered within the grid.
*   The output grid has the same dimensions (12x12).
*   The output grid retains the Orange (7) background and the Azure (8) column structure.
*   All Magenta (6) pixels present in the input have been replaced in the output.
*   Observing the replacement locations, it appears that Magenta (6) pixels are consistently replaced by Orange (7) pixels, even if the Magenta pixel was located in a position typically occupied by Azure (8) (e.g., Input[1, 4]=6 becomes Output[1, 4]=7). Orange (7) is the dominant or "background" color in this example.

**Overall Pattern:**
In both examples, there's a color (Magenta=6) that seems to act as "noise" or an unwanted element. This "noise" color is removed and replaced by the most frequent color in the input grid (excluding the noise color itself).

## Facts YAML


```yaml
task_description: Replace all pixels of a specific 'noise' color (Magenta=6) with the most frequent 'background' color found in the input grid (excluding the noise color).

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: height and width (variable, consistent between input and output)
      - background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid, excluding Magenta(6). (Azure=8 in train_1, Orange=7 in train_2)
      - pattern_colors: Other colors forming patterns or structures. (Yellow=4 in train_1, Azure=8 in train_2)
      - noise_color: A specific color to be removed (Magenta=6 in both examples).

actions:
  - identify_noise_color: Recognize Magenta(6) as the target color for removal.
  - identify_background_color:
      - Calculate the frequency of all colors present in the input grid.
      - Exclude the noise_color (Magenta=6) from the frequency count.
      - Determine the color with the highest remaining frequency.
  - replace_pixels:
      - Iterate through every pixel in the input grid.
      - If a pixel's color matches the noise_color, change its color in the output grid to the identified background_color.
      - Otherwise, copy the pixel's original color to the output grid.

relationships:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - All pixels retain their original color unless they match the noise_color.
  - Pixels matching the noise_color are replaced by the background_color.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Identify the "noise" color as Magenta (color 6).
3.  Count the frequency of all other colors present in the input grid.
4.  Determine the color with the highest frequency count among the non-noise colors; this is the "background" color.
5.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
6.  For each pixel in the input grid:
    a.  If the pixel's color is Magenta (6), set the corresponding pixel in the new grid to the identified background color.
    b.  Otherwise, set the corresponding pixel in the new grid to the same color as the input pixel.
7.  Return the new grid as the output.
