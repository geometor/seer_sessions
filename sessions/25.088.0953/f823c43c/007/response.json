Identify a 'noise' color, which is consistently magenta (6) in the examples.\n2. Analyze the non-noise pixels in the input grid to determine the two most\n   dominant colors: C1 (most frequent) and C2 (second most frequent). Handle\n   cases where fewer than two non-noise colors exist (defaulting to white=0 or\n   using the single color for both C1 and C2).\n3. Infer the underlying pattern of the grid based on the non-noise pixels. This\n   pattern consists of two parts:\n    a. An 'even row' pattern: Determined by observing non-noise pixels in even rows.\n       (Based on examples, this is consistently just C1).\n    b. An 'odd row' pattern: Determined by observing non-noise pixels in odd rows.\n       This pattern involves C1 and potentially C2, often in a repeating sequence\n       based on the column index.\n4. Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.\n5. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.\n6. If the pixel `input_grid[r, c]` is the noise color (6):\n    a. Determine the replacement color using the inferred pattern:\n        - If the row `r` is even, use the color defined by the 'even row'\n          pattern for column `c`.\n        - If the row `r` is odd, use the color defined by the 'odd row'\n          pattern for column `c`.\n    b. Update the `output_grid[r, c]` with the determined replacement color.\n7. Pixels that were not the noise color remain unchanged in the output grid.\n8. Return the final output grid.\n\nPattern Inference Details:\n- The 'even row' pattern is assumed to be C1 for all columns based on examples.\n- The 'odd row' pattern is inferred by finding the first odd row containing\n  both C1 and C2 (if C1 and C2 are different). The sequence of non-noise\n  colors in this row is analyzed to find the shortest repeating unit. This\n  unit is then used to generate the full odd row pattern prototype. If no odd\n  row contains both C1 and C2, the pattern defaults to C1 for all columns. If\n  only C2 is present in an odd row (and C1 != C2), that might indicate C2 is\n  the pattern (though less likely based on examples).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_pattern_colors(grid, noise_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the two most frequent colors in the grid, excluding the noise_color.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        noise_color (int): The color value to exclude from frequency counting.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (C1, C2) where C1 is the most frequent and C2 is the second\n               most frequent non-noise color.
