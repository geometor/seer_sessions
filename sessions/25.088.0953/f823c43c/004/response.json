Match.\n\nThe 3 mismatches are at [1, 4], [7, 1], [7, 7]. These are the locations where the input is magenta (6), the expected output is azure (8), and the code output was orange (7).\n\nLet's apply the \"ideal pattern\" hypothesis from Example 1. What is the pattern here?\nThe output grid looks like rows of solid orange (7), alternating with rows of alternating orange (7) and azure (8).\n*   Rows 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 are solid orange (7).\n*   Rows 1, 4, 7, 10 are alternating 7, 8, 7, 8... starting with 7 in column 0.\n\nPredict the replacement color based on this ideal pattern:\n*   [1, 4] (alternating row, even col) -> predicted 7.

Match.\n\nThis \"ideal pattern\" rule derived from Example 1 doesn't work well for Example 2. It gets some right, but fails often.\n\nLet's revisit the \"neighbor\" idea. What are the neighbors of the magenta pixels that get replaced by azure (8) in Example 2? These are [1, 4], [7, 1], [7, 7].\n*   Input[1, 4] = 6. Neighbors = [Input[0,4]=7, Input[2,4]=7, Input[1,3]=7, Input[1,5]=7]. Non-6 N = {7, 7, 7, 7}. Most frequent: 7. Expected: 8.\n*   Input[7, 1] = 6. Neighbors = [Input[6,1]=7, Input[8,1]=6, Input[7,0]=7, Input[7,2]=7]. Non-6 N = {7, 7, 7}. Most frequent: 7. Expected: 8.\n*   Input[7, 7] = 6. Neighbors = [Input[6,7]=7, Input[8,7]=6, Input[7,6]=6, Input[7,8]=6]. Non-6 N = {7}. Most frequent: 7. Expected: 8.\n\nThe neighbor rule still fails.\n\nWhat is common about the locations [1, 4], [7, 1], [7, 7]?\nIn the input grid, they have an azure (8) pixel nearby.\n*   Input[1, 4]=6. Nearby 8s: Input[1, 1], Input[1, 7].\n*   Input[7, 1]=6. Nearby 8s: Input[7, 4], Input[7, 10]. (Also Input[4,4], Input[4,7], Input[4,10]...)\n*   Input[7, 7]=6. Nearby 8s: Input[7, 4], Input[7, 10].\n\nLet's look at the locations replaced by orange (7). Do they have an azure (8) nearby?\n*   Input[1, 8]=6. Nearby 8s: Input[1, 1], Input[1, 7], Input[1, 10]. Replaced by 7.\n*   Input[1, 11]=6. Nearby 8s: Input[1, 1], Input[1, 7], Input[1, 10]. Replaced by 7.\n\nThis doesn't seem right either.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure. The azure (8) pixels in the input *and* output seem significant. They form patterns.\nExample 1: No azure (8) in the input, only 8 and 4 (and 6). Output has 8 and 4.\nExample 2: Azure (8) present in input. Orange (7) also present. Output has 7 and 8.\n\nMaybe the rule is: Find the non-magenta pixel that is 'closest' to the magenta pixel being replaced? No, that's too complex and ambiguous.\n\nLet's step back. What is the simplest explanation?\nThe task involves \"cleaning up\" noise (magenta=6 pixels).\nThe replacement color seems context-dependent.\n\nIn Ex1, the context is a checkerboard of 8 and 4. The replacement restores this pattern.\nIn Ex2, the context is a pattern of 7 and 8. The replacement restores this pattern.\n\nHow is the underlying pattern determined? It seems to be defined by the non-magenta pixels already present in the input grid.\n\nHypothesis Refined:\n1. Identify the 'noise' color (magenta=6).\n2. Identify the 'pattern' colors (all colors present in the input except magenta).\n3. For each magenta pixel location (r, c):\n    a. Determine the color that *should* be at (r, c) based on the pattern formed by the non-magenta neighbors.\n    b. Replace the magenta pixel with this determined color.\n\nHow to determine the pattern?\nLook at the non-magenta neighbors (Von Neumann or Moore?).\n*   Ex1, Loc [3, 5]: Input=6. Neighbors(Von Neumann): {8, 8, 4, 6}. Non-6 N = {8, 8, 4}. Pattern seems to be 8 and 4. How to decide between 8 and 4 for this specific location?\n*   Ex1, Loc [11, 5]: Input=6. Neighbors(Von Neumann): {6, 6, 6, 6}. No non-6 neighbors.\n*   Ex2, Loc [1, 4]: Input=6. Neighbors(Von Neumann): {7, 7, 7, 7}. Non-6 N = {7, 7, 7, 7}. Pattern seems to be 7. But expected output is 8.\n*   Ex2, Loc [7, 7]: Input=6. Neighbors(Von Neumann): {7, 6, 6, 6}. Non-6 N = {7}. Pattern seems to be 7. But expected output is 8.\n\nThis suggests the pattern isn't determined *solely* by immediate neighbors. Maybe we need to look further, or perhaps the pattern is simpler.\n\nConsider the case where a magenta pixel has NO non-magenta neighbors (like Ex1, [11, 5]). How is its replacement color determined? Expected output is 4. Where could that 4 come from? The neighbors of the neighbors?\nNeighbors of [11, 5] are [10, 5]=6, [12, 5]=6, [11, 4]=6, [11, 6]=6.\nNeighbors of [10, 5]: {8, 6, 8, 6}. Non-6 = {8, 8}.\nNeighbors of [12, 5]: {6, 8, 8, 8}. Non-6 = {8, 8, 8}.\nNeighbors of [11, 4]: {4, 6, 4, 6}. Non-6 = {4, 4}.\nNeighbors of [11, 6]: {8, 8, 6, 4}. Non-6 = {8, 8, 4}.\nThe colors {8, 4} appear in the 2-neighborhood. 8 is more frequent (7 times) than 4 (3 times). But the expected replacement is 4.\n\nMaybe it's the most frequent non-magenta color within a 3x3 window centered on the magenta pixel?\n*   Ex1, Loc [3, 5]: Window = [[8,6,8],[8,6,6],[8,8,6]]. Non-6 = {8,8,8,8,8}. Most frequent=8. Expected=4. Fails.\n*   Ex1, Loc [11, 5]: Window = [[6,6,8],[6,6,6],[6,6,8]]. Non-6 = {8,8}. Most frequent=8. Expected=4. Fails.\n*   Ex2, Loc [1, 4]: Window = [[7,6,7],[7,6,7],[6,7,7]]. Non-6 = {7,7,7,7,7,7}. Most frequent=7. Expected=8. Fails.\n*   Ex2, Loc [7, 1]: Window = [[7,7,7],[6,6,7],[6,6,7]]. Non-6 = {7,7,7,7,7}. Most frequent=7. Expected=8. Fails.\n*   Ex2, Loc [7, 7]: Window = [[7,7,6],[6,6,6],[6,6,7]]. Non-6 = {7,7,7}. Most frequent=7. Expected=8. Fails.\n\nThe local neighborhood frequency rule (immediate or 3x3) seems incorrect.\n\nLet's revisit the \"ideal pattern\" idea but make it more robust.\nThe output grids look very regular. Maybe the rule is simply to fill the grid based on a pattern determined by `(row, col)` coordinates, ignoring the input magenta values entirely, but keeping the non-magenta input values fixed?\n\nTest this:\n1. Create the output grid initialized with the input grid.\n2. Identify the dominant non-noise color (e.g., color A) and the secondary non-noise color (e.g., color B). (Need a rule for this - maybe most frequent and second most frequent?)\n   - Ex1: A=8, B=4\n   - Ex2: A=7, B=8\n3. Determine the pattern type (e.g., checkerboard, solid rows, alternating rows). This seems example-dependent.\n   - Ex1: Checkerboard (Even rows=A, Odd rows=Alt(A,B))\n   - Ex2: Alt Solid/Alt (Solid rows=A, Alt rows=Alt(A,B))\n4. Iterate through all cells (r, c) where input[r, c] == 6 (magenta).\n5. Calculate the color C that *should* be at (r, c) according to the identified pattern.\n6. Set output[r, c] = C.\n\nLet's apply this to Ex1:\n1. Output = Input.\n2. A=8, B=4.\n3. Pattern: Even rows=8. Odd rows: if col is even, 8; if col is odd, 4.\n4. Iterate through magenta locations:\n   - [3, 5] (odd row, odd col): Pattern color = 4. Set output[3, 5] = 4.\n   - [3, 15] (odd row, odd col): Pattern color = 4. Set output[3, 15] = 4.\n   - [11, 5] (odd row, odd col): Pattern color = 4. Set output[11, 5] = 4.\n   - [13, 3] (odd row, odd col): Pattern color = 4. Set output[13, 3] = 4.\n   - [13, 5] (odd row, odd col): Pattern color = 4. Set output[13, 5] = 4.\n   - [13, 12] (odd row, even col): Pattern color = 8.

Set output = 8.\nThis matches the expected output for Example 1 perfectly!\n\nApply to Ex2:\n1. Output = Input.\n2. A=7, B=8.\n3. Pattern: Need to determine which rows are solid and which are alternating. Look at the *output* grid pattern: Rows 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 are solid 7. Rows 1, 4, 7, 10 are Alt(7,8).\n4. Iterate through magenta locations:\n   - [1, 4] (alt row, even col): Pattern color = 7. Set output[1, 4] = 7. (Expected was 8!) - Fails.\n   - [7, 1] (alt row, odd col): Pattern color = 8. Set output[7, 1] = 8. (Expected was 8!) - Match.\n   - [7, 7] (alt row, odd col): Pattern color = 8. Set output[7, 7] = 8. (Expected was 8!) - Match.\n\nWhy did [1, 4] fail? The pattern rule Alt(A, B) means even cols = A (7), odd cols = B (8). Col 4 is even, so pattern color is 7. But expected is 8.\nMaybe the alternating pattern starts differently? Alt(B, A)? No, look at row 1 output: 7 8 7 7 8 7 7 8 7 7 8 7. It's mostly 7s with some 8s. Not a simple alternation.\n\nThis suggests the pattern itself isn't purely coordinate-based but might be influenced by the *existing* non-magenta pixels in that row/column or neighborhood.\n\nLet's reconsider the neighbor idea, but specifically for determining the *pattern* at a magenta location.\n\nAlternative Hypothesis: Replace magenta (6) with the most frequent non-magenta color among its 8 neighbors (Moore neighborhood). If there's a tie, or no non-magenta neighbors, use a default (e.g., the overall most frequent non-magenta color).\n\nTest on Ex1:\n*   [3, 5]: Input=6. Moore N = {8,8,4, 8,6, 8,6,6}. Non-6 N = {8,8,4,8,8}. Freq: {8:4, 4:1}. Most freq = 8. Expected=4. Fails.\n*   [11, 5]: Input=6. Moore N = {8,6,6, 4,6, 4, 8,6,8}. Non-6 N = {8,4,4,8,8}. Freq: {8:3, 4:2"
