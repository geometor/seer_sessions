Input:
  elements:
    - type: background
      color: white (0)
    - type: object
      color: azure (8)
      properties:
        - shape: variable, contiguous pixels
        - size: variable, number of pixels
        - count: variable, multiple objects per grid (M)
        - position: defined by pixel coordinates

Output:
  elements:
    - type: background
      color: white (0)
    - type: object
      color: variable (blue(1), red(2), green(3), orange(7))
      properties:
        - shape: identical to corresponding input object
        - size: identical to corresponding input object
        - count: identical to input (M)
        - position: identical to corresponding input object

Transformation:
  action: recolor_objects
  target: azure (8) objects
  rule:
    - identify_objects: Find all distinct contiguous groups of azure (8) pixels.
    - calculate_properties: For each object, determine its size (pixel count) and the coordinate of its top-most, left-most pixel.
    - sort_objects: Create an ordered list of objects, sorted primarily by size (ascending) and secondarily by top-left coordinate (row ascending, then column ascending).
    - determine_color_sequence: Based on the total number of objects (M), select a predefined sequence of colors.
        - M=4: [Green, Green, Orange, Orange]
        - M=5: [Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Green]
        - M=6: [Blue, Red, Red, Red, Green, Orange]
    - assign_colors: Iterate through the sorted list of objects. Assign the color from the determined sequence at the index corresponding to the object's rank (1st object gets 1st color, etc.).
    - apply_recoloring: Change the color of all pixels belonging to each object from azure (8) to its assigned new color.

Relationships:
  - input_output_object_correspondence: Each azure object in the input maps directly to one recolored object in the output, preserving shape, size, and position.
  - color_dependency: The output color of an object depends on its size-based rank relative to other objects and the total number of objects in the input grid.
