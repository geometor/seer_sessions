task_description: Recolors azure objects based on their size rank and the total number of objects.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - input_object_color: azure (8)
  - connectivity: 8-way (including diagonals)
object_identification:
  - description: Find all distinct connected groups of azure (8) pixels.
  - properties:
      - size: count of pixels in the object
      - top_left_coordinate: (row, column) of the uppermost, leftmost pixel
object_sorting:
  - criteria:
      - primary: size (ascending)
      - secondary: top_left_coordinate (row ascending, then column ascending)
transformation:
  - action: Recolor identified azure objects.
  - rule: Assign a new color to each object based on its rank in the sorted list.
  - color_sequences:
      - condition: If total number of objects (M) is 4
        sequence: [green(3), green(3), orange(7), orange(7)]
      - condition: If total number of objects (M) is 5
        sequence: [blue(1), red(2), red(2), blue(1), green(3)] # Corrected sequence
      - condition: If total number of objects (M) is 6
        sequence: [blue(1), red(2), red(2), red(2), green(3), orange(7)]
output_grid:
  - Preserve the shape and background color of the input grid.
  - Replace the original azure pixels of each object with its newly assigned color.
