Identifies all distinct connected components (objects) of azure (8) pixels.\n2. Calculates the size (pixel count) and top-left coordinate for each object.\n3. Sorts the objects based primarily on size (ascending) and secondarily on their \n   top-left coordinate (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).\n4. Determines a specific color sequence based on the total number of objects found (M).\n   - M=4: [Green(3), Green(3), Orange(7), Orange(7)]\n   - M=5: [Red(2), Blue(1), Red(2), Blue(1), Green(3)]\n   - M=6: [Blue(1), Red(2), Red(2), Red(2), Green(3), Orange(7)]\n5.
