task_description: Connect three specific colored points with gray paths in a fixed order.
components:
  grid_size: 13x13 (consistent across examples)
  background_color: white (0)
  objects:
    - type: pixel
      color: red (2)
      count: 1
      role: start_point_1
    - type: pixel
      color: yellow (4)
      count: 1
      role: intermediate_point / start_point_2
    - type: pixel
      color: green (3)
      count: 1
      role: end_point_2
    - type: pixel
      color: gray (5)
      role: path_pixel
      origin: added during transformation
relationships:
  - type: connection
    from: red (2)
    to: yellow (4)
    via: gray path (5)
    shape: L-shape (horizontal segment on start row, vertical segment on end column)
  - type: connection
    from: yellow (4)
    to: green (3)
    via: gray path (5)
    shape: L-shape (horizontal segment on start row, vertical segment on end column)
actions:
  - action: identify_pixels
    colors: [red(2), yellow(4), green(3)]
    purpose: find coordinates of the three key points
  - action: draw_path
    color: gray (5)
    from: red (2) coordinates
    to: yellow (4) coordinates
    rule: L-shape (horizontal on start row, vertical on end column)
  - action: draw_path
    color: gray (5)
    from: yellow (4) coordinates
    to: green (3) coordinates
    rule: L-shape (horizontal on start row, vertical on end column)
properties:
  - pixel_colors_preserved: red, green, yellow pixels remain in their original locations.
  - path_color: path is always gray (5).
  - path_type: Manhattan (horizontal/vertical segments only).
  - connection_order: fixed sequence Red -> Yellow -> Green.
