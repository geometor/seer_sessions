            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure**: Each input grid is a 13x13 grid primarily composed of white pixels (0). There are exactly three non-white pixels in each input grid: one red (2), one green (3), and one yellow (4). Their positions vary across the examples.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure**: Each output grid is also 13x13. It retains the original red, green, and yellow pixels from the input. Additionally, it contains gray pixels (5) forming paths. The white pixels (0) remain where no colored pixel or path exists.\n3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves adding gray pixels (5) to connect the three initial colored pixels (red, green, yellow).\n4.  **Path Characteristics**: The gray pixels form two connected \"L\" shapes. The paths follow horizontal and vertical lines only (Manhattan path).\n5.  **Connection Order**: Observing the examples consistently shows a specific connection order:\n    *   An L-shaped path connects the red pixel (2) to the yellow pixel (4).\n    *   Another L-shaped path connects the yellow pixel (4) to the green pixel (3).\n6.  **Path Formation Rule**: For connecting point A (r1, c1) to point B (r2, c2):\n    *   A horizontal line of gray pixels is drawn on row `r1` between column `c1` and column `c2` (exclusive of the start point `c1`, inclusive of the end column `c2`).\n    *   A vertical line of gray pixels is drawn on column `c2` between row `r1` and row `r2` (exclusive of the start row `r1`, inclusive of the end row `r2`).\n    *   The \"corner\" of the L-shape is at `(r1, c2)`.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet**\n\n"
