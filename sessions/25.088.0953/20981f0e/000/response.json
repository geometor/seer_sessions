            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are grids containing pixels of three colors: white (0 - background), blue (1), and red (2).\n2.  **Static Elements**: The red pixels appear in fixed horizontal lines, acting as barriers or separators. Their positions are identical in both the input and output grids.\n3.  **Dynamic Elements**: The blue pixels form various shapes (single pixels, lines, L-shapes, squares). These blue shapes change their vertical positions between the input and output.\n4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation seems to be a form of \"gravity\" acting on the blue pixels. They move downwards within the grid.\n5.  **Constraints**: The downward movement of blue pixels is constrained. They stop when they encounter:\n    *   A red pixel directly below them.\n    *   Another blue pixel directly below them (that has already settled or is part of the same falling object).\n    *   The bottom edge of the grid.\n6.  **Segmentation**: The horizontal lines of red pixels effectively divide the grid into independent horizontal segments. The gravity effect applies to blue pixels within each segment, bounded by the red lines above and below (or the grid edges).\n7.  **Object Integrity**: Connected groups of blue pixels (objects) appear to maintain their shape and relative pixel positions as they fall; they move as a single unit.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Repeatedly iterate through the grid until no blue pixels can move further down:\n    a.  For each blue pixel in the current grid state (it's helpful to iterate from bottom-to-top, right-to-left to prioritize lower objects settling first):\n    b.  Check if the pixel belongs to a blue object that can move down one step. An object can move down if *every* pixel position directly below *each* of the object's constituent blue pixels is currently white (color 0) and within the grid boundaries.\n    c.  If an object can move down:\n        i.  Update the grid state by changing all the object's current pixel locations to white (0).\n        ii. Change all the pixel locations directly below the object's original positions to blue (1).\n        iii. Record that a move occurred during this iteration.\n    d.  If an object cannot move down (because at least one pixel below it is red, blue, or the grid boundary), it remains in its current position for this iteration.\n5.  Once an entire iteration completes with no blue pixels moving, the process is finished. The resulting grid is the final output."
