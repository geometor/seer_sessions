Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: variable height and width (up to 30x30)
    - background_color: 0 (white)
Objects:
  - Type: Movable
    Properties:
      - color: 1 (blue)
      - definition: contiguous group of blue pixels (orthogonal adjacency)
      - shape: preserved during transformation
  - Type: Barrier
    Properties:
      - color: 2 (red)
      - definition: single pixels or contiguous groups
      - behavior: static, obstructs movement
Actions:
  - Name: Gravity Simulation
    Target: Blue Objects (color 1)
    Mechanism:
      - Iteratively move blue objects downwards one step at a time.
      - An entire blue object moves together as a single unit.
      - Movement continues until no blue object can move further down in a full iteration pass.
    Stopping Conditions (for a blue object):
      - Any part of the object is directly above a red pixel (color 2).
      - Any part of the object is directly above a blue pixel belonging to a *different*, already settled blue object.
      - Any part of the object reaches the bottom boundary of the grid.
    Order:
      - Within an iteration, objects are potentially evaluated or moved based on their vertical position to ensure stable settling (e.g., lower objects settle before objects above them). # The previous code attempted sorting by lowest point.
