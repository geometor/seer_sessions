            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.\n\n## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided code attempts to simulate gravity acting on blue objects (1), which fall downwards until obstructed by red barriers (2), other blue objects, or the grid bottom. The results clearly show that the code fails on all training examples. The blue objects in the transformed outputs fall much further than they should in the expected outputs, often passing through red barriers or ending up incorrectly stacked at the bottom.\n\nThe core issue seems to lie in the `can_object_move_down` function and potentially the overall simulation loop logic. The current `can_object_move_down` function checks if *any* part of the object has a clear space below it, rather than ensuring *all* parts requiring downward movement have clear space. An object should only move if *every* pixel directly below one of its pixels is either background (0) or part of the same object (which is implicitly handled by moving the whole object). It must stop if *any* part of it would collide with a red barrier (2) or another blue object (1).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct `can_object_move_down`:** Modify the function to return `True` only if *all* cells immediately below the object's pixels are either background (0) or already occupied by pixels belonging to the *same* object (which shouldn't happen with the current whole-object move logic, but is crucial for correctness). If *any* cell below is a barrier (2), another blue object (1), or the grid boundary, the function should return `False`.\n2.  **Verify Object Identification:** Ensure `find_connected_components` correctly identifies the distinct blue objects. Based on the problem description, this seems adequate (orthogonal connectivity).\n3.  **Refine Simulation Loop:** The iterative process (`while True`) with sorting objects by lowest point (`reverse=True`) seems conceptually sound for achieving stability from the bottom up. However, the implementation detail of erasing *all* movable objects before redrawing *might* need reconsideration if the corrected `can_object_move_down` doesn't resolve the issues, but it's likely the movement check is the primary flaw.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's gather some metrics to confirm the behavior. We'll focus on the blue (1) and red (2) pixels.\n\n"

(This implies lower objects must be stable or moved first).\n    *   An object *can* move down one step only if *all* cells directly below its constituent pixels are either background (0) or occupied by a blue pixel belonging to the *same* object.\n5.  To handle dependencies correctly (lower objects stabilize first), process objects potentially from bottom-to-top or use an iterative stabilization approach. A possible method:\n    *   Identify *all* potentially movable objects based on the current grid state.\n    *   If no objects can move, exit the loop.\n    *   Create a temporary next-state grid, initialized as a copy of the current grid.\n    *   For each object identified as movable:\n        *   Clear its current position in the *temporary* grid (set to background color 0).\n        *   Draw the object in its new position (one step down) in the *temporary* grid.\n    *   Update the main grid state to match the temporary grid.\n    *   Repeat the loop.\n6.  Once the loop terminates (no objects moved in an iteration), return the final grid state."
