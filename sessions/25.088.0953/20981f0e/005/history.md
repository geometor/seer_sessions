"""
Simulate gravity on blue objects (color 1) within a grid.

The grid contains a background (color 0, typically white), blue objects (color 1), and static barriers (color 2, typically red).
Blue objects are defined as contiguous groups of blue pixels using orthogonal connectivity (up, down, left, right).
The transformation involves moving blue objects downwards, one step at a time, until they cannot move further.
An object stops moving if any part of it encounters:
1. A red pixel directly below it.
2. A blue pixel belonging to another object (or an already settled part of the same object in more complex scenarios, although not strictly needed with whole-object movement) directly below it.
3. The bottom edge of the grid.

Red pixels remain fixed throughout the process.
Blue objects maintain their shape during the fall.
The process iterates until no blue object can move down in a full pass.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided code attempts to simulate gravity acting on blue objects (1), which fall downwards until obstructed by red barriers (2), other blue objects, or the grid bottom. The results clearly show that the code fails on all training examples. The blue objects in the transformed outputs fall much further than they should in the expected outputs, often passing through red barriers or ending up incorrectly stacked at the bottom.

The core issue seems to lie in the `can_object_move_down` function and potentially the overall simulation loop logic. The current `can_object_move_down` function checks if *any* part of the object has a clear space below it, rather than ensuring *all* parts requiring downward movement have clear space. An object should only move if *every* pixel directly below one of its pixels is either background (0) or part of the same object (which is implicitly handled by moving the whole object). It must stop if *any* part of it would collide with a red barrier (2) or another blue object (1).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct `can_object_move_down`:** Modify the function to return `True` only if *all* cells immediately below the object's pixels are either background (0) or already occupied by pixels belonging to the *same* object (which shouldn't happen with the current whole-object move logic, but is crucial for correctness). If *any* cell below is a barrier (2), another blue object (1), or the grid boundary, the function should return `False`.
2.  **Verify Object Identification:** Ensure `find_connected_components` correctly identifies the distinct blue objects. Based on the problem description, this seems adequate (orthogonal connectivity).
3.  **Refine Simulation Loop:** The iterative process (`while True`) with sorting objects by lowest point (`reverse=True`) seems conceptually sound for achieving stability from the bottom up. However, the implementation detail of erasing *all* movable objects before redrawing *might* need reconsideration if the corrected `can_object_move_down` doesn't resolve the issues, but it's likely the movement check is the primary flaw.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's gather some metrics to confirm the behavior. We'll focus on the blue (1) and red (2) pixels.

    red_pixels = np.sum(grid == 2)
    
    # Find the lowest row index containing a blue pixel
    blue_indices = np.argwhere(grid == 1)
    lowest_blue_row = -1
    if blue_indices.size > 0:
        lowest_blue_row = np.max(blue_indices[:, 0])
        
    return {
        "dimensions": dims,
        "blue_pixel_count": int(blue_pixels),
        "red_pixel_count": int(red_pixels),
        "lowest_blue_row": int(lowest_blue_row) # -1 if no blue pixels

**Metrics Interpretation:**

*   **Dimensions, Blue/Red Counts:** These are consistent across Input, Expected, and Actual for each example, confirming the code doesn't add/remove pixels or change colors incorrectly.
*   **Lowest Blue Row:** This metric highlights the problem.
    *   Example 1: Input lowest=11, Expected=10, Actual=12 (bottom edge).
    *   Example 2: Input lowest=10, Expected=9, Actual=13 (bottom edge).
    *   Example 3: Input lowest=14, Expected=14, Actual=16 (bottom edge).
    *   In all cases, the actual lowest row is at or near the grid bottom, significantly lower than the expected lowest row. This confirms the blue objects are falling too far and not stopping correctly at the barriers (red pixels) or other blue objects as intended.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: variable height and width (up to 30x30)
    - background_color: 0 (white)
Objects:
  - Type: Movable
    Properties:
      - color: 1 (blue)
      - definition: contiguous group of blue pixels (orthogonal adjacency)
      - shape: preserved during transformation
  - Type: Barrier
    Properties:
      - color: 2 (red)
      - definition: single pixels or contiguous groups
      - behavior: static, obstructs movement
Actions:
  - Name: Gravity Simulation
    Target: Blue Objects (color 1)
    Mechanism:
      - Iteratively move blue objects downwards one step at a time.
      - An entire blue object moves together as a single unit.
      - Movement continues until no blue object can move further down in a full iteration pass.
    Stopping Conditions (for a blue object):
      - Any part of the object is directly above a red pixel (color 2).
      - Any part of the object is directly above a blue pixel belonging to a *different*, already settled blue object.
      - Any part of the object reaches the bottom boundary of the grid.
    Order:
      - Within an iteration, objects are potentially evaluated or moved based on their vertical position to ensure stable settling (e.g., lower objects settle before objects above them). # The previous code attempted sorting by lowest point.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all distinct blue objects (contiguous blocks of color 1 using orthogonal adjacency) in the input grid.
2.  Identify all static red barrier pixels (color 2).
3.  Enter a simulation loop that continues as long as at least one blue object moves in an iteration.
4.  Inside the loop, determine which blue objects are currently able to move down one step:
    *   For each blue object, examine all grid cells directly below each of its constituent pixels.
    *   An object *cannot* move if *any* of these cells below it meets one of the following conditions:
        *   It is outside the bottom grid boundary.
        *   It contains a red pixel (2).
        *   It contains a blue pixel (1) belonging to a *different* blue object that is *not* also moving down in the *same* step. (This implies lower objects must be stable or moved first).
    *   An object *can* move down one step only if *all* cells directly below its constituent pixels are either background (0) or occupied by a blue pixel belonging to the *same* object.
5.  To handle dependencies correctly (lower objects stabilize first), process objects potentially from bottom-to-top or use an iterative stabilization approach. A possible method:
    *   Identify *all* potentially movable objects based on the current grid state.
    *   If no objects can move, exit the loop.
    *   Create a temporary next-state grid, initialized as a copy of the current grid.
    *   For each object identified as movable:
        *   Clear its current position in the *temporary* grid (set to background color 0).
        *   Draw the object in its new position (one step down) in the *temporary* grid.
    *   Update the main grid state to match the temporary grid.
    *   Repeat the loop.
6.  Once the loop terminates (no objects moved in an iteration), return the final grid state.
