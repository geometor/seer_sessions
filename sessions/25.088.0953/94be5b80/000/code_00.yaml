task_description: "Copies shapes associated with inner palette colors, recolors them using outer palette colors, and places them vertically offset based on the distance between the original shapes."

elements:
  - role: palette
    description: "A small, compact object (1xN row or Nx1 column) of unique, adjacent, non-background colors."
    properties:
      - sequence_of_colors: [C1, C2, ..., CN]
      - count: N (number of colors)
  - role: core_objects
    description: "Larger objects in the grid whose colors match the inner palette colors C2 through C(N-1)."
    properties:
      - count: N - 2
      - items:
        - object: Obj2 (color C2, specific shape, position)
        - object: Obj3 (color C3, specific shape, position)
        - ...
        - object: Obj(N-1) (color C(N-1), specific shape, position)
  - role: vertical_displacement
    description: "The vertical distance between the top rows of the first two core objects."
    calculation: "delta_y = top_row(Obj3) - top_row(Obj2)"
  - role: generated_object_1
    description: "A new object created based on Obj2 and C1."
    properties:
      - color: C1
      - shape: Same as Obj2
      - position: Top row is top_row(Obj2) - delta_y, horizontal position matches Obj2.
  - role: generated_object_2 (conditional)
    condition: "N > 3"
    description: "A new object created based on Obj(N-1) and CN."
    properties:
      - color: CN
      - shape: Same as Obj(N-1)
      - position: Top row is top_row(Obj(N-1)) + delta_y, horizontal position matches Obj(N-1).

actions:
  - identify: palette object and its color sequence [C1, ..., CN].
  - identify: core objects Obj2, ..., Obj(N-1) corresponding to colors C2, ..., C(N-1).
  - calculate: vertical displacement delta_y between Obj2 and Obj3.
  - create: generated_object_1 by copying Obj2, recoloring with C1, and positioning using -delta_y.
  - create: (if N > 3) generated_object_2 by copying Obj(N-1), recoloring with CN, and positioning using +delta_y.
  - construct_output: Start with an empty grid, add original core objects (Obj2..Obj(N-1)) and all generated objects. The palette is implicitly removed.

relationships:
  - The colors of the core objects match the inner colors of the palette sequence.
  - The shapes of the generated objects are copied from specific core objects.
  - The colors of the generated objects come from the outer colors of the palette sequence.
  - The vertical positioning of the generated objects depends on the relative vertical positioning of the first two core objects.
