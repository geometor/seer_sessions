            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Palette Object:** In both examples, there's a small, distinct object composed of a sequence of unique, non-background colors arranged adjacently in a line (vertically in `train_1`, horizontally in `train_2`). This seems to function as a key or palette defining the colors involved in the transformation. Let the colors in the palette sequence be C1, C2, ..., CN.\n2.  **Core Objects:** The input grid also contains larger objects whose colors correspond to the *inner* colors of the palette sequence (C2, C3, ..., C(N-1)). In `train_1` (palette [yellow, blue, magenta]), the core objects are the blue 'H' (C2) and the magenta 'H' (C3). In `train_2` (palette [orange, red, blue, green]), the core objects are the red shape (C2) and the blue shape (C3).\n3.  **Spatial Relationship:** There's a consistent vertical offset between the core objects. In `train_1`, the magenta 'H' is 5 rows below the blue 'H'. In `train_2`, the blue shape is 3 rows below the red shape.\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grid retains the original core objects but removes the palette object. Crucially, new objects are created:\n    *   An object with the shape of the *first* core object (Obj2) but colored with the *first* palette color (C1) appears *above* the original position of Obj2.\n    *   If the palette has more than 3 colors (N>3), an object with the shape of the *last* core object (Obj(N-1)) but colored with the *last* palette color (CN) appears *below* the original position of Obj(N-1).\n    *   The vertical displacement used for positioning these new objects is the same as the vertical distance calculated between the first two core objects (Obj2 and Obj3).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

(Note: If N=4, Obj(N-1) is the same as Obj3).\n5.  Calculate the vertical displacement: `delta_y = top_row(Obj3) - top_row(Obj2)`.\n6.  Create a new grid, the same size as the input, filled with the background color (white/0).\n7.  Copy the original object Obj2 onto the new grid at its original position.\n8.  Copy the original object Obj3 onto the new grid at its original position.\n9.  If N > 4 (meaning there are more core objects like Obj4, etc.), copy Obj4 through Obj(N-1) onto the new grid at their original positions.\n10. Create a new object by taking the shape of Obj2 and coloring it with C1. Place this object on the new grid such that its top row is `top_row(Obj2) - delta_y` and its leftmost column matches Obj2's leftmost column.\n11. If N > 3: Create another new object by taking the shape of Obj(N-1) (the last core object found in step 3 or 4) and coloring it with CN (the last palette color). Place this object on the new grid such that its top row is `top_row(Obj(N-1)) + delta_y` and its leftmost column matches Obj(N-1)'s leftmost column.\n12. The final grid constructed in steps 6-11 is the output."
