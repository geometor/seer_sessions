A frame is defined as a rectangular boundary, at least one pixel thick, composed entirely of a single, contiguous non-background color (colors 1 through 9). The region inside the frame (the interior) must contain at least one pixel whose color differs from the frame's color.\n    2.  Calculate the area (height * width) of the bounding box for each identified frame.\n    3.  Select the frame that has the largest bounding box area. If there is a tie in area, select the frame whose top-left corner is located at the smallest row index; if there is still a tie, select the one with the smallest column index.\n    4.  Determine the coordinates of the interior region of the selected frame. This region excludes the frame's boundary pixels. If the frame's bounding box spans rows `min_row` to `max_row` and columns `min_col` to `max_col`, the interior spans rows `min_row + 1` to `max_row - 1` and columns `min_col + 1` to `max_col - 1`.\n    5.  Extract the subgrid corresponding to these interior coordinates from the input grid. This extracted subgrid is the output."
