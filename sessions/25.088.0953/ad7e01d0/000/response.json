            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** All examples take a small grid (3x3 or 4x4) as input and produce a larger grid as output.\n2.  **Output Size:** The output grid's dimensions seem related to the input grid's dimensions. If the input is HxW, the output is (H*H) x (W*W). For example, a 3x3 input yields a 9x9 output, and a 4x4 input yields a 16x16 output.\n3.  **Tiling Structure:** The output grid appears to be constructed from smaller tiles, where each tile has the same dimensions as the original input grid (HxW). These tiles are arranged in an HxW grid structure within the larger output grid.\n4.  **Conditional Tile Content:** The content of each tile in the output grid depends on the corresponding pixel in the input grid.\n5.  **Mapping Rule:** Observing the examples, specifically comparing the input pixels to the content of the corresponding output tiles, reveals a pattern:\n    *   If a pixel in the input grid has the color gray (value 5), the corresponding tile in the output grid is a direct copy of the *entire original input grid*.\n    *   If a pixel in the input grid has *any other color* (including white, value 0), the corresponding tile in the output grid is filled entirely with white (value 0).\n\n**YAML Block of Facts:**\n\n"

Create a template \"white tile\" grid with dimensions H rows and W columns, filled entirely with white (0).\n4.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid using its row index `r` (from 0 to H-1) and column index `c` (from 0 to W-1).\n5.  For the current input pixel at `(r, c)`, check its color value.\n6.  If the color value is gray (5):\n    *   Identify the target region in the output grid where the corresponding tile should be placed. This region starts at row `r * H` and column `c * W` and has dimensions HxW.\n    *   Copy the *entire original input grid* into this target region in the output grid.\n7.  If the color value is *not* gray (5):\n    *   Identify the target region in the output grid (same as step 6a).\n    *   Copy the \"white tile\" grid (created in step 3) into this target region in the output grid.\n8.  After iterating through all input pixels, the output grid is complete. Return the output grid."
