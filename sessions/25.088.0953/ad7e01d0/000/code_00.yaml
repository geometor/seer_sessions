task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 2D
input_object:
  type: grid
  properties:
    height: H
    width: W
output_object:
  type: grid
  properties:
    height: H*H
    width: W*W
    structure: Tiled grid composed of HxW subgrids (tiles)
transformation:
  type: conditional_tiling
  mapping: Pixel-to-Tile
  rule:
    - condition: Input pixel at (row_in, col_in) is gray (5).
      action: Place a copy of the original input grid into the output grid tile starting at (row_in * H, col_in * W).
    - condition: Input pixel at (row_in, col_in) is NOT gray (5).
      action: Place an HxW tile filled with white (0) into the output grid tile starting at (row_in * H, col_in * W).
constants:
  - trigger_color: gray (5)
  - background_color: white (0)
