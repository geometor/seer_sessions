Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Background:** The input grids consistently use azure (8) as a background color, separating distinct areas.
2.  **Key Objects:** The inputs feature two distinct rectangular areas composed primarily of white (0) pixels, embedded within the azure background.
3.  **Internal Features:** Within these white rectangles, there are patterns or single pixels of other colors (green, yellow, red, blue). These non-white pixels seem important.
4.  **Transformation:** The output grid appears to be derived from one of the white rectangular areas found in the input.
5.  **Output Size:** The dimensions (height and width) of the output grid vary and correspond to the dimensions of one of the input white rectangles.
6.  **Output Content:** The content (the pattern of pixels) within the output grid corresponds to the content of the *other* white rectangle from the input.
7.  **Selection Criteria:** The crucial step seems to be deciding which input white rectangle provides the *size* for the output and which provides the *content*. Comparing the examples:
    *   **Example 1:** Top-left white area (9x9) has 1 green pixel. Bottom-right white area (7x6) has 1 green and 7 yellow pixels (total 8). Output is 9x9 (size from top-left) and contains the pattern from the bottom-right (content from area with more non-white pixels).
    *   **Example 2:** Top-right white area (5x5) has 1 red pixel. Bottom-left white area (6x6) has 1 red and 7 yellow pixels (total 8). Output is 5x5 (size from top-right) and contains the top-left 5x5 portion of the pattern from the bottom-left (content from area with more non-white pixels, cropped/placed into the smaller size).
    *   **Example 3:** Top-left white area (7x7) has 1 blue and 7 yellow pixels (total 8). Bottom-right white area (8x7) has 1 blue pixel. Output is 8x7 (size from bottom-right) and contains the pattern from the top-left (content from area with more non-white pixels, placed into the top-left of the larger size, padded with white).
8.  **Rule:** Identify the two white rectangles. Count the non-white, non-azure pixels inside each. The rectangle with *fewer* such pixels determines the output grid's dimensions. The rectangle with *more* such pixels provides the content pattern, which is placed (and potentially cropped or padded with white) into the top-left corner of the output grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to locate exactly two distinct rectangular regions composed entirely of white (0) pixels, where each region is fully enclosed by the azure (8) background color.
2.  For each of these white rectangles, count the total number of pixels contained within it that are *neither* white (0) *nor* azure (8).
3.  Identify the white rectangle that has the strictly *higher* count of these internal non-white/non-azure pixels. This rectangle will be designated the "Content Source".
4.  Identify the *other* white rectangle (which will have the lower or equal count). This rectangle will be designated the "Size Source".
5.  Determine the height and width of the "Size Source" rectangle.
6.  Create a new output grid with the exact height and width determined in the previous step. Initialize all pixels in this new grid to white (0).
7.  Extract the subgrid corresponding precisely to the "Content Source" rectangle from the input grid.
8.  Copy the pixels from the extracted "Content Source" subgrid into the top-left corner of the newly created output grid.
    *   If the "Content Source" is larger than the output grid dimensions, only copy the top-left portion that fits.
    *   If the "Content Source" is smaller than the output grid dimensions, the copied portion will occupy the top-left, and the remaining area of the output grid will retain its initial white (0) fill.
9.  The resulting grid is the final output.
