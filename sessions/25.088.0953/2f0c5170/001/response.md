"""
Identifies two distinct rectangular regions containing non-azure (8) pixels within an azure background.
Counts the number of 'significant' pixels (neither white (0) nor azure (8)) within each region's bounding box.
The region bounding box with the *fewer* significant pixels determines the output grid's dimensions.
The region bounding box with the *more* significant pixels provides the content pattern.
Creates an output grid of the determined size, initialized to white (0), and places the content
pattern (potentially cropped or padded with white) into the top-left corner of the output grid.
