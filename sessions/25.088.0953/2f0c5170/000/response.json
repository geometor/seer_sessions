            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Background:** The input grids consistently use azure (8) as a background color, separating distinct areas.\n2.  **Key Objects:** The inputs feature two distinct rectangular areas composed primarily of white (0) pixels, embedded within the azure background.\n3.  **Internal Features:** Within these white rectangles, there are patterns or single pixels of other colors (green, yellow, red, blue). These non-white pixels seem important.\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grid appears to be derived from one of the white rectangular areas found in the input.\n5.  **Output Size:** The dimensions (height and width) of the output grid vary and correspond to the dimensions of one of the input white rectangles.\n6.  **Output Content:** The content (the pattern of pixels) within the output grid corresponds to the content of the *other* white rectangle from the input.\n7.  **Selection Criteria:** The crucial step seems to be deciding which input white rectangle provides the *size* for the output and which provides the *content*. Comparing the examples:\n    *   **Example 1:** Top-left white area (9x9) has 1 green pixel. Bottom-right white area (7x6) has 1 green and 7 yellow pixels (total 8). Output is 9x9 (size from top-left) and contains the pattern from the bottom-right (content from area with more non-white pixels).\n    *   **Example 2:** Top-right white area (5x5) has 1 red pixel. Bottom-left white area (6x6) has 1 red and 7 yellow pixels (total 8). Output is 5x5 (size from top-right) and contains the top-left 5x5 portion of the pattern from the bottom-left (content from area with more non-white pixels, cropped/placed into the smaller size).\n    *   **Example 3:** Top-left white area (7x7) has 1 blue and 7 yellow pixels (total 8). Bottom-right white area (8x7) has 1 blue pixel. Output is 8x7 (size from bottom-right) and contains the pattern from the top-left (content from area with more non-white pixels, placed into the top-left of the larger size, padded with white).\n8.  **Rule:** Identify the two white rectangles. Count the non-white, non-azure pixels inside each. The rectangle with *fewer* such pixels determines the output grid's dimensions. The rectangle with *more* such pixels provides the content pattern, which is placed (and potentially cropped or padded with white) into the top-left corner of the output grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

The resulting grid is the final output."
