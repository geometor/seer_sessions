task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  colors: {0: white, 2: red}
  output_grid_size: [7, 7]
  input_grid_size: variable

input_elements:
  - element_type: background
    color: 0 (white)
    properties: covers most of the grid
  - element_type: object
    color: 2 (red)
    properties:
      - contiguous block of red pixels
      - count: exactly 4 per input grid
      - shape_extent: fits within a 3x3 bounding box (including internal white pixels)
      - location: scattered across the input grid

output_elements:
  - element_type: background
    color: 0 (white)
  - element_type: object_pattern
    color: 2 (red)
    properties:
      - derived from input objects
      - arranged in specific locations

transformation:
  actions:
    - identify: find all distinct contiguous red objects in the input grid.
    - extract: determine the 3x3 bounding box content for each identified red object.
    - sort: order the extracted objects based on their top-left coordinate in the input grid (sort by row index first, then column index).
    - create_canvas: initialize a 7x7 output grid filled with white (0).
    - place: arrange the sorted objects onto the output grid in a 2x2 layout:
        - 1st object -> top-left quadrant (0:3, 0:3)
        - 2nd object -> top-right quadrant (0:3, 4:7)
        - 3rd object -> bottom-left quadrant (4:7, 0:3)
        - 4th object -> bottom-right quadrant (4:7, 4:7)
  relationships:
    - The output is a composite structure formed by arranging representations of the input objects.
    - The relative spatial positions of objects in the input determine their placement order in the output grid.
    - The central row and column of the output grid act as fixed white separators between the object representations.
