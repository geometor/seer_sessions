**Perception of the task elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** The inputs are large grids containing scattered red (2) objects on a white (0) background. The outputs are smaller, fixed-size 7x7 grids, also containing red and white pixels.
2.  **Objects:** The key elements in the input grids are distinct, contiguous groups of red pixels. There appear to be exactly four such objects in each input example.
3.  **Object Properties:** Each red object seems to fit perfectly within a 3x3 bounding box, potentially containing some white pixels within that box.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves extracting these four red objects from the input, determining an order for them, and arranging them within the 7x7 output grid.
5.  **Arrangement:** The four objects are placed in the output grid in a 2x2 configuration. The top-left object occupies rows 0-2 and columns 0-2. The top-right occupies rows 0-2 and columns 4-6. The bottom-left occupies rows 4-6 and columns 0-2. The bottom-right occupies rows 4-6 and columns 4-6. The central row (index 3) and central column (index 3) are filled with white pixels, acting as separators.
6.  **Ordering:** The order in which the input objects are placed into the output quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) appears to be determined by their position in the input grid. Sorting the objects based on the row index of their top-most pixel, and then by the column index of their left-most pixel (i.e., top-left coordinate of their bounding box), seems to establish the correct placement order.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  colors: {0: white, 2: red}
  output_grid_size: [7, 7]
  input_grid_size: variable

input_elements:
  - element_type: background
    color: 0 (white)
    properties: covers most of the grid
  - element_type: object
    color: 2 (red)
    properties:
      - contiguous block of red pixels
      - count: exactly 4 per input grid
      - shape_extent: fits within a 3x3 bounding box (including internal white pixels)
      - location: scattered across the input grid

output_elements:
  - element_type: background
    color: 0 (white)
  - element_type: object_pattern
    color: 2 (red)
    properties:
      - derived from input objects
      - arranged in specific locations

transformation:
  actions:
    - identify: find all distinct contiguous red objects in the input grid.
    - extract: determine the 3x3 bounding box content for each identified red object.
    - sort: order the extracted objects based on their top-left coordinate in the input grid (sort by row index first, then column index).
    - create_canvas: initialize a 7x7 output grid filled with white (0).
    - place: arrange the sorted objects onto the output grid in a 2x2 layout:
        - 1st object -> top-left quadrant (0:3, 0:3)
        - 2nd object -> top-right quadrant (0:3, 4:7)
        - 3rd object -> bottom-left quadrant (4:7, 0:3)
        - 4th object -> bottom-right quadrant (4:7, 4:7)
  relationships:
    - The output is a composite structure formed by arranging representations of the input objects.
    - The relative spatial positions of objects in the input determine their placement order in the output grid.
    - The central row and column of the output grid act as fixed white separators between the object representations.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all distinct contiguous groups of red (2) pixels in the input grid. These are the "objects". There will be exactly four such objects.
2.  For each object, determine its minimal bounding box. Extract the 3x3 grid patch corresponding to this bounding box from the input grid.
3.  Determine the top-left coordinate (row, column) of the bounding box for each of the four objects within the original input grid.
4.  Sort the four extracted 3x3 patches based on their original top-left coordinates: first by row index (ascending), then by column index (ascending).
5.  Create a new 7x7 grid initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
6.  Place the sorted 3x3 patches onto the 7x7 grid as follows:
    *   Place the first sorted patch into the top-left 3x3 area (rows 0-2, columns 0-2).
    *   Place the second sorted patch into the top-right 3x3 area (rows 0-2, columns 4-6).
    *   Place the third sorted patch into the bottom-left 3x3 area (rows 4-6, columns 0-2).
    *   Place the fourth sorted patch into the bottom-right 3x3 area (rows 4-6, columns 4-6).
7.  The resulting 7x7 grid is the final output.
