The outputs are smaller, fixed-size 7x7 grids, also containing red and white pixels.\n2.  **Objects:** The key elements in the input grids are distinct, contiguous groups of red pixels. There appear to be exactly four such objects in each input example.\n3.  **Object Properties:** Each red object seems to fit perfectly within a 3x3 bounding box, potentially containing some white pixels within that box.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves extracting these four red objects from the input, determining an order for them, and arranging them within the 7x7 output grid.\n5.  **Arrangement:** The four objects are placed in the output grid in a 2x2 configuration. The top-left object occupies rows 0-2 and columns 0-2. The top-right occupies rows 0-2 and columns 4-6. The bottom-left occupies rows 4-6 and columns 0-2. The bottom-right occupies rows 4-6 and columns 4-6. The central row (index 3) and central column (index 3) are filled with white pixels, acting as separators.\n6.  **Ordering:** The order in which the input objects are placed into the output quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) appears to be determined by their position in the input grid. Sorting the objects based on the row index of their top-most pixel, and then by the column index of their left-most pixel (i.e., top-left coordinate of their bounding box), seems to establish the correct placement order.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
