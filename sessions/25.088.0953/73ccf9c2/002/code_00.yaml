task_description: Crop the input grid to the bounding box of a specific non-white object.
input_features:
  - type: grid
    description: Contains a white background (color 0) and one or more distinct objects composed of a single non-white color.
    properties:
      - multiple_objects: True
      - background_color: white (0)
      - object_colors: single non-white color per example (blue, red, green)
      - objects_contiguous: True (using 8-way connectivity)
      - objects_separated: True (by background color)
output_features:
  - type: grid
    description: A subgrid extracted from the input.
    properties:
      - content: Corresponds exactly to the selected object and included background pixels within its bounding box.
      - size: Determined by the bounding box of the selected object.
transformation:
  - step: 1
    action: identify_objects
    description: Find all distinct connected components (objects) of non-white pixels in the input grid. Use 8-way connectivity.
  - step: 2
    action: calculate_bounding_boxes
    description: For each identified object, determine its minimum bounding box coordinates (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
  - step: 3
    action: select_object
    description: Choose the object whose bounding box has the maximal bottom-right corner coordinates. Compare first by max_row (higher is better), then by max_col (higher is better).
    criteria: max(max_row, max_col)
  - step: 4
    action: crop_grid
    description: Extract the subgrid from the original input corresponding to the bounding box coordinates of the selected object.
    output: The final output grid.
