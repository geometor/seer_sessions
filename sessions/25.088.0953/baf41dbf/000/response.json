            "text": "*   **Perception:**\n    The task involves modifying input grids containing green shapes (often hollow rectangles) and magenta \"marker\" pixels. The transformation fills the area adjacent to the green shapes, using the magenta pixels as guides to determine the direction and extent of the fill. Each green shape seems associated with a specific magenta marker. If a marker is horizontally aligned with a shape (within its vertical bounds) and located to the right or left, the fill extends horizontally from the shape's edge towards the marker's column. If a marker is vertically aligned with a shape (within its horizontal bounds) and located above or below, the fill extends vertically from the shape's edge towards the marker's row. The fill color is always green. Multiple shapes and markers can exist in a single grid, and each shape is filled independently based on its associated marker.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
