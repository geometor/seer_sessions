task_description: Fill areas around green shapes based on magenta markers.
objects:
  - type: shape
    color: 3 # green
    attributes:
      - contiguous block of pixels
      - has an initial bounding box
  - type: marker
    color: 6 # magenta
    attributes:
      - single pixel
      - guides the extension of green shapes

interactions:
  - type: extension
    source: green shape
    target: grid area
    guide: magenta markers
    conditions:
      - A marker guides extension if it aligns horizontally OR vertically with the initial bounding box of the green shape AND is outside that initial box.
      - Horizontal alignment: marker row is within the shape's initial min/max row.
      - Vertical alignment: marker column is within the shape's initial min/max column.
    result:
      - Defines an "extended bounding box".
      - The extended box expands from the initial box towards the marker(s), stopping one pixel short of the marker.
      - Multiple markers can extend the same edge; the furthest marker determines the final extent (using min/max).

transformation:
  - type: fill
    color: 3 # green
    target_area: Pixels within the calculated extended bounding box for each green shape.
    exceptions:
      - Do not change magenta (6) markers from the input.
      - Do not change pixels that were white (0) in the input AND are located within the initial bounding box of the corresponding green shape.
  - type: copy
    color: any
    source_area: Pixels outside any calculated extended bounding box.
    target_area: Corresponding pixels in the output.
    condition: These pixels retain their original color from the input.

output_grid:
  - Represents the input grid after applying the extension and fill rules.
  - Preserves original magenta markers.
  - Preserves original white "holes" within the initial green shape bounding boxes.
  - Fills the newly extended areas and original green areas with green.
