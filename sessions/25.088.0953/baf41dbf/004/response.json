            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.\n\n**1. General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying green shapes, finding associated magenta markers, calculating an extended bounding box based on marker alignment, and filling this extended box with green.\n\nThe results show that the code consistently fails (`Match: False`) across all training examples. The primary issue appears to be *how* the extended area is filled. The current code fills the *entire* calculated extended bounding box with green (preserving only the magenta markers), whereas the expected outputs show that:\na.  The original green shape pixels remain green.\nb.  Pixels *within the original shape's bounding box* that were initially white (0) remain white.\nc.  Pixels *outside* the original shape's bounding box but *inside* the calculated *extended* bounding box become green.\nd.  Magenta markers (6) always retain their color and position.\n\nThe strategy will be to refine the natural language program and subsequent code implementation to correctly handle the filling process, respecting the original internal structure (specifically, the white pixels) within the initial shape's bounding box while extending the green color into the new areas defined by the markers.\n\n**2. Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's analyze each example to confirm the pattern.\n\n"

Identify all distinct, contiguous green (3) shapes in the input grid and determine the initial bounding box (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column) for each shape.\n3.  Identify the coordinates of all magenta (6) marker pixels in the input grid.\n4.  For each identified green shape:\n    a.  Calculate its corresponding \"extended bounding box\":\n        i.  Start with the dimensions of the shape's initial bounding box.\n        ii. Examine each magenta marker. If a marker is horizontally aligned with the *initial* bounding box (marker's row is within the box's row range) and lies outside the box's column range, adjust the corresponding column boundary (minimum or maximum column) of the extended bounding box to reach one pixel short of the marker's column.\n        iii. Similarly, if a marker is vertically aligned with the *initial* bounding box (marker's column is within the box's column range) and lies outside the box's row range, adjust the corresponding row boundary (minimum or maximum row) of the extended bounding box to reach one pixel short of the marker's row.\n        iv. Use `min` for top/left extensions and `max` for bottom/right extensions to handle multiple markers affecting the same boundary correctly. The result is the final extended bounding box for this shape.\n    b.  Iterate through all pixel coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) within this calculated extended bounding box.\n    c.  For each pixel (r, c) inside the extended bounding box:\n        i.  Check if the pixel at `input_grid[r, c]` is a magenta marker (6). If it is, do nothing (the marker is preserved from the initial copy).\n        ii. Check if the pixel (r, c) falls *within* the *initial* bounding box of the current green shape AND the pixel at `input_grid[r, c]` is white (0). If both are true, do nothing (preserving the internal \"hole\").\n        iii. Otherwise (the pixel is not a marker, and it's not an internal white hole within the initial bounds), set the pixel in the `output_grid[r, c]` to green (3).\n5.  Return the modified output grid."
