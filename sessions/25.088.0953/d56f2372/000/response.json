Each object is a contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color.\n2.  **Objects:** The objects vary in color, shape, size (pixel count), and position within the input grid. There are multiple objects in each input grid, each with a different color.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output is a smaller grid containing only *one* of the objects from the input grid, placed on a white background. The output grid is sized to be the minimal bounding box containing the selected object.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task is to identify *which* object from the input grid should be selected and then extract that object into the output grid. The background color is irrelevant except for defining object boundaries.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Treat each group as a separate object.\n2.  **Analyze Objects:** For each identified object, record its color, its total pixel count, the row number of its top-most pixel (`start_row`), the row number of its bottom-most pixel (`end_row`), and the column number of its left-most pixel (`start_col`).\n3.  **Find Extremes:** Determine the overall minimum `start_row` present across all objects (`min_start_row`) and the overall maximum `end_row` present across all objects (`max_end_row`).\n4.  **Identify Top/Bottom Objects:** Create a list of objects whose `start_row` equals `min_start_row` (the `top_objects`). Create a list of objects whose `end_row` equals `max_end_row` (the `bottom_objects`).\n5.  **Select the Target Object:** Apply the following rules in order to choose the target object:\n    *   **Rule A (Unique Top & Bottom):** If there is exactly one object in `top_objects` AND exactly one object in `bottom_objects`:\n        *   Compare the pixel counts of these two unique objects.\n        *   Select the object with the larger pixel count.\n        *   If their pixel counts are identical, select the object from `top_objects`.\n    *   **Rule B (Unique Top Only):** If Rule A does not apply, and there is exactly one object in `top_objects`:\n        *   Select that object.\n    *   **Rule C (Unique Bottom Only):** If Rules A and B do not apply, and there is exactly one object in `bottom_objects`:\n        *   Select that object.\n    *   **Rule D (Top Tie-breaker):** If none of the above rules apply (this implies there must be multiple objects in `top_objects`):\n        *   Examine the objects currently in `top_objects`.\n        *   Select the object among them that has the smallest `start_col` (the left-most one).\n6.  **Extract and Output:** Determine the bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column) of the selected target object. Create a new grid whose dimensions match the height and width of this bounding box. Copy the pixels of the target object into this new grid, preserving their relative positions within the bounding box. Fill any remaining cells in the new grid with the background color (white, 0). This new grid is the final output."
