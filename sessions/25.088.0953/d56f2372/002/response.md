## General Assessment

The initial code failed on all training examples. The outputs were single cells (`[[6]]`, `[[4]]`) or the wrong object (`Red` object instead of `Blue`), indicating that the selection logic derived from only the first example was incorrect or incompletely captured the pattern. The core issue seems to be the criteria used to select the *target* object from multiple objects present in the input grid. The original logic prioritized unique top/bottom positions and size, but Example 3 showed this was insufficient. The analysis suggests a refined prioritization is needed, specifically handling multiple top-most objects before falling back to selecting a unique bottom-most object.

## Metrics and Analysis

Code was executed to identify objects and their properties (color, pixel count, start/end rows, start column) for each example.
