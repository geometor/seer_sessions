If they are the same object, select it.\n    b. If they are different objects, compare their pixel counts. Select the object with the larger pixel count. \n    c. If their pixel counts are equal, select the top_object.\n\n2.  **Unique Top Only:** If there is exactly one top_object, select it (regardless of how many bottom_objects there are, unless Rule 1 applied).\n\n3.  **Multiple Top Objects:** If there are multiple top_objects: Select the top_object that has the smallest starting column index (left-most).\n\n4.  **Unique Bottom Only:** (Only if rules 1-3 do not apply, meaning zero top_objects which shouldn't happen if there are objects, or multiple top_objects were already handled) If there is exactly one bottom_object, select it.\n\n5.  **Fallback (Should not be reached with ARC constraints and above rules):** If no object is selected by the above rules (e.g. multiple top and multiple bottom objects, but none are unique top/bottom according to rule 1), select the first object found by the object detection algorithm.\n\nFinally, create a new grid containing only the selected target object, cropped to its minimal bounding box, preserving its shape and color against a background of white (0).\n\"\"\"\n\n# Imports included within the function where needed to adhere to template request\n# Helper function outside transform for clarity\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all distinct contiguous objects of non-background color in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an object\n              and contains its 'color', 'pixels' (list of (r, c) tuples),\n              'pixel_count', 'start_row' (min row), 'end_row' (max row), \n              'start_col' (min col), and 'bounding_box' (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c).\n              Returns an empty list if no objects are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    # from collections import deque - Import implicitly available or assumed top-level\n    # import numpy as np - Import implicitly available or assumed top-level\n    objects = []\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    \n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                pixels = []\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                min_r, max_r = r, r\n                min_c, max_c = c, c\n                \n                pixel_set = set() # Use set for efficient coordinate tracking during BFS\n                pixel_set.add((r,c))\n\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    pixels.append((row, col))\n                    min_r = min(min_r, row)\n                    max_r = max(max_r, row)\n                    min_c = min(min_c, col)\n                    max_c = max(max_c, col)\n                    \n                    # Check neighbors (4-directional adjacency)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and \\\n                           not visited[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == color:\n                            if (nr, nc) not in pixel_set: # Check if already added to queue/visited in this object's BFS\n                                visited[nr, nc] = True\n                                q.append((nr, nc))\n                                pixel_set.add((nr, nc))\n                            \n                if pixels:\n                    # Ensure pixels list contains unique coordinates before counting\n                    unique_pixels = list(pixel_set) \n                    objects.append({\n                        'id': len(objects), # Add a unique ID for comparison\n                        'color': color,\n                        'pixels': unique_pixels, \n                        'pixel_count': len(unique_pixels),\n                        'start_row': min_r,\n                        'end_row': max_r,\n                        'start_col': min_c,\n                        'bounding_box': (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c) \n                    })\n                    \n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by identifying objects, selecting one based on positional\n    rules (top-most, bottom-most, left-most) and size, and extracting it to a new grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # import numpy as np - Import implicitly available or assumed top-level\n    \n    grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # 1.
