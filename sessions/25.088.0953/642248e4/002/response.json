            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the presence of horizontal or vertical borders and their colors. It also correctly identified the trigger pixel color (blue) and the target pixel color (white). However, it failed because it applied the transformation rule too broadly. The code painted *any* adjacent white pixel (above/below for horizontal borders, left/right for vertical borders) with the corresponding border color, provided the target pixel was within the inner grid boundaries.\n\nAnalysis of the expected outputs reveals a more specific condition: a white pixel adjacent to a blue pixel is only painted if it lies in the direction of the *closest* border relative to the blue pixel's position. For instance, with horizontal borders, if a blue pixel is closer to the top border than the bottom border, only a white pixel directly *above* it (if present and within the inner grid) will be painted with the top border's color. A white pixel below it would remain unchanged. The converse applies if the blue pixel is closer to the bottom border. A similar logic applies to vertical borders based on closeness to the left or right border. The provided examples do not include cases where a blue pixel is exactly equidistant from the two relevant borders.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nManual analysis of the examples confirms the \"closest border\" hypothesis:\n\n*   **Example 1 (Horizontal, H=12):** Blue pixels in rows r=2, 3, 5 are closer to the top (r=0) than the bottom (r=11). They correctly cause painting *above*. Blue pixels in rows r=6, 8, 9 are closer to the bottom; they correctly cause painting *below*.\n*   **Example 2 (Horizontal, H=14):** Blue pixels in rows r=2, 3, 5, 6 are closer to the top (r=0) than the bottom (r=13). They correctly cause painting *above*. Blue pixels in rows r=7, 9, 10, 11 are closer to the bottom; they correctly cause painting *below*.\n*   **Example 3 (Vertical, W=10):** Blue pixels in columns c=2, 3 are closer to the left (c=0) than the right (c=9). They correctly cause painting *left*. Blue pixels in columns c=5, 6 are closer to the right; they correctly cause painting *right*.\n\nThe discrepancies (`Pixels Off`) between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` in the failed tests correspond exactly to the instances where the previous code painted a white pixel adjacent to a blue pixel, but that pixel was *not* in the direction of the closest border.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Examine the input grid to identify if it has either a pair of uniform, non-white, distinct-colored horizontal borders (top and bottom rows) or a pair of uniform, non-white, distinct-colored vertical borders (left and right columns). The grid must be at least 3x1 (for horizontal) or 1x3 (for vertical) to accommodate borders and an inner area. If no such border pair exists, return the input grid unchanged.\n2.  Store the colors of the identified borders (e.g., `color_top`, `color_bottom` or `color_left`, `color_right`).\n3.  Define the \"inner grid\" as the portion of the grid excluding the border rows/columns.\n4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n5.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid that falls within the inner grid boundaries.\n6.  If the cell `(r, c)` contains a blue pixel (color 1):\n    a.  **If horizontal borders were found:** Calculate the distance from the blue pixel's row `r` to the top border (row 0) and the bottom border (row `height-1`).\n        i.
