task_description: Connect aligned pairs of same-colored pixels with lines, vertical lines overwrite horizontal lines at intersections.

grid_properties:
  - size: Variable (up to 30x30)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - pixel_colors: 0-9 mapped to specific colors.

objects:
  - type: Pixel Pair
    properties:
      - color: Must be the same non-white color for both pixels in the pair.
      - count: Exactly two pixels of a given color must exist to form a pair.
      - alignment: The pair must be either horizontally aligned (same row) or vertically aligned (same column).

actions:
  - action: Identify Pairs
    description: Find all non-white colors present exactly twice in the input grid.
    input: input grid
    output: List of pairs, each defined by color and two coordinates.
  - action: Draw Horizontal Lines
    description: For each horizontally aligned pair, draw a line of the pair's color between the two pixels (inclusive). This modifies the grid.
    input: Grid, List of horizontal pairs
    output: Modified grid
    constraints: Overwrites any existing pixel color along the line path.
  - action: Draw Vertical Lines
    description: For each vertically aligned pair, draw a line of the pair's color between the two pixels (inclusive). This modifies the grid.
    input: Grid (potentially modified by horizontal lines), List of vertical pairs
    output: Final modified grid
    constraints: Overwrites any existing pixel color along the line path, including pixels potentially colored by horizontal lines.

workflow:
  - Copy input grid to output grid.
  - Find all valid pixel pairs.
  - Perform "Draw Horizontal Lines" action on the output grid using horizontal pairs.
  - Perform "Draw Vertical Lines" action on the output grid using vertical pairs.
  - Return the final output grid.

# Example 1 Intersection:
# - Red pair: (2, 6), (13, 6) -> Vertical
# - Green pair: (6, 3), (6, 11) -> Horizontal
# - Intersection point: (6, 6)
# - Process: Draw Green line H -> (6, 6) = 3. Draw Red line V -> (6, 6) = 2. Final: 2 (Red). Matches expected.

# Example 1 Intersection 2:
# - Magenta pair: (18, 4), (27, 4) -> Vertical
# - Gray pair: (20, 2), (20, 7) -> Horizontal
# - Intersection point: (20, 4)
# - Process: Draw Gray line H -> (20, 4) = 5. Draw Magenta line V -> (20, 4) = 6. Final: 6 (Magenta). Matches expected.
