            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core mechanic: finding pairs of same-colored pixels that are horizontally or vertically aligned and connecting them. However, the implementation incorrectly overwrites existing non-white pixels when drawing the connecting lines. The expected outputs clearly show that these connecting lines should only fill in the white (0) background pixels between the pair, leaving other colored pixels along the path untouched.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the line-drawing logic to check the color of the pixel being filled. If the pixel is white (0), it should be filled with the line color. If the pixel is any other color, it should be skipped, preserving its original color.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the differences between the expected output and the generated output for each example to confirm the assessment.\n"

The *input* has Green (3) at `(6, 3)` and `(6, 11)`, and Red (2) at `(2, 6)` and `(13, 6)`. The code drew the Green line horizontally correctly. It then drew the Red line vertically. The expected output shows the Red line stopping *before* overwriting the Green line pixel at `(6, 6)`. However, my code output interpretation seems to have flipped the colors. Let's re-examine.\n        *   Expected: Pixel `(6, 6)` should be Red (2). Generated: Pixel `(6, 6)` is Green (3). The Red vertical line *should* have overwritten the Green horizontal line's pixel. My initial assessment was slightly off.\n        *   At `(20, 4)`, the expected output has Magenta (6), but the generated output has Gray (5). Input has Gray (5) at `(20, 2)` and `(20, 7)`, and Magenta (6) at `(18, 4)` and `(27, 4)`. The code drew the Gray line horizontally correctly. It then drew the Magenta line vertically. The expected output shows the Magenta line *overwriting* the Gray line pixel at `(20, 4)`. Generated: Pixel `(20, 4)` is Gray (5). My code drew the gray line `(20, 2)` to `(20, 7)` and the magenta line `(18, 4)` to `(27, 4)`. The generated output at `(20, 4)` is 5 (Gray). Expected is 6 (Magenta). Why did the code output 5? The python code iterates through colors. Let's assume Gray (5) came before Magenta (6). Gray line is drawn. Then Magenta line is drawn. The code `output_grid[r, c1] = color` *should* overwrite. Ah, I see my python code has a bug in the vertical loop `output_grid[r, c1] = color`, it uses `c1` which is correct, but the `transformed_output` shown in the prompt output for Example 1 at `(20, 4)` is `5` not `6`. This suggests the *prompt's* `transformed_output` might be wrong based on the provided Python code, or my understanding of the code execution is flawed. Let's trust the *expected* output and the *difference report*. The difference report states: Expected: 6, Actual: 5 at (20, 4). This means the generated code *did* produce 5, failing to overwrite with 6. Why? This could happen if the loop for Gray (5) runs *after* the loop for Magenta (6). The `defaultdict` doesn't guarantee order. Let's check the `find_colored_pixels` result.\n        "

            "text": "The order of iteration through the dictionary keys (colors) depends on the Python version and insertion order. In modern Python (3.7+), dictionary order is guaranteed to be insertion order. Based on the input scan, the order would be 2, 3, 8, 6, 5.\nSo, the Red (2) line is drawn first. Then Green (3). Then Azure (8). Then Magenta (6). Finally, Gray (5).\nLet's re-trace Example 1 with this order:\n1.  Red (2) vertical line `(2, 6)` to `(13, 6)`. Output `(6, 6)` becomes 2.\n2.  Green (3) horizontal line `(6, 3)` to `(6, 11)`. Output `(6, 6)` becomes 3 (overwrites Red).\n3.  Azure (8) vertical line `(12, 14)` to `(17, 14)`. No overlaps.\n4.  Magenta (6) vertical line `(18, 4)` to `(27, 4)`. Output `(20, 4)` becomes 6.\n5.  Gray (5) horizontal line `(20, 2)` to `(20, 7)`. Output `(20, 4)` becomes 5 (overwrites Magenta).\n\nThis matches the `transformed_output` described by the difference report (Actual: 3 at (6,6), Actual: 5 at (20,4)).\nNow compare this to the `expected_output`:\n*   At `(6, 6)`, Expected: 2, Actual: 3. This means the Green line should *not* overwrite the Red line.\n*   At `(20, 4)`, Expected: 6, Actual: 5. This means the Gray line should *not* overwrite the Magenta line.\n\nThis contradicts my earlier interpretation. Let's re-examine the *expected* outputs visually.\nExample 1 Expected: `(6, 6)` is 2 (Red). `(20, 4)` is 6 (Magenta).\nExample 2 Expected: `(4, 3)` is 4 (Yellow). `(8, 3)` is 4 (Yellow). `(14, 5)` is 9 (Maroon).\n\nIt appears that when lines intersect, the color of the line that was \"drawn\" *first* based on the pixel coordinates takes precedence, or perhaps vertical lines take precedence over horizontal ones, or vice-versa?\n\nLet's test hypotheses:\n*   **Hypothesis A: Only fill white pixels.**\n    *   Ex1 (6, 6): Red line draws first. (6,6) becomes 2. Green line encounters pixel (6,6) which is Red(2), so it skips it. Pixel remains 2. Matches Expected.\n    *   Ex1 (20, 4): Magenta line draws first. (20,4) becomes 6. Gray line encounters pixel (20,4) which is Magenta(6), so it skips it. Pixel remains 6. Matches Expected.\n    *   Ex2 (4, 3): Yellow line draws first. (4,3) becomes 4. Green line encounters pixel (4,3) which is Yellow(4), so it skips it. Pixel remains 4. Matches Expected.\n    *   Ex2 (8, 3): Yellow line draws first. (8,3) becomes 4. Orange line encounters pixel (8,3) which is Yellow(4), so it skips it. Pixel remains 4. Matches Expected.\n    *   Ex2 (14, 5): Maroon line draws first. (14,5) becomes 9. Blue line encounters pixel (14,5) which is Maroon(9), so it skips it. Pixel remains 9. Matches Expected.\n\n*   **Hypothesis B: Vertical lines overwrite horizontal.**\n    *   Ex1 (6, 6): Green horizontal line drawn first. (6,6) becomes 3. Red vertical line drawn second, overwrites (6,6) to 2. Matches Expected.\n    *   Ex1 (20, 4): Gray horizontal line drawn first. (20,4) becomes 5. Magenta vertical line drawn second, overwrites (20,4) to 6. Matches Expected.\n    *   Ex2 (4, 3): Green horizontal line drawn first. (4,3) becomes 3. Yellow vertical line drawn second, overwrites (4,3) to 4. Matches Expected.\n    *   Ex2 (8, 3): Orange horizontal line drawn first. (8,3) becomes 7. Yellow vertical line drawn second, overwrites (8,3) to 4. Matches Expected.\n    *   Ex2 (14, 5): Blue horizontal line drawn first. (14,5) becomes 8. Maroon vertical line drawn second, overwrites (14,5) to 9. Matches Expected.\n\n*   **Hypothesis C: Horizontal lines overwrite vertical.**\n    *   Ex1 (6, 6): Red vertical line drawn first. (6,6) becomes 2. Green horizontal line drawn second, overwrites (6,6) to 3. Doesn't match Expected.\n\nHypothesis A (Only fill white pixels) seemed promising initially but failed the ordering test based on the `defaultdict` iteration. Hypothesis B (Vertical lines overwrite horizontal) seems to match all intersection points in the expected outputs. This suggests a two-pass approach: first draw all horizontal lines, then draw all vertical lines, allowing vertical lines to overwrite horizontal ones if they intersect.\n\nLet's refine the assessment and strategy based on Hypothesis B.\n\n**Refined Assessment:**\nThe core mechanic is connecting aligned pairs of same-colored pixels. Horizontal lines are drawn between horizontally aligned pairs. Vertical lines are drawn between vertically aligned pairs. When lines intersect, the vertical line's color takes precedence, overwriting the horizontal line's color at the intersection point. The lines fill all pixels between the endpoints, including potentially overwriting pixels colored by other lines.\n\n**Refined Strategy:**\n1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2.  Identify all pairs of same-colored pixels for each color.\n3.  First Pass: Iterate through all pairs. If a pair is horizontally aligned, draw the horizontal line on the output grid, overwriting existing pixels.\n4.  Second Pass: Iterate through all pairs again. If a pair is vertically aligned, draw the vertical line on the output grid, overwriting existing pixels (including those potentially drawn in the first pass).\n\n## YAML Facts Documentation\n\n"
