These colored pixels often appear in pairs. The task seems to involve identifying these pairs of same-colored pixels. If a pair is aligned either horizontally (sharing the same row) or vertically (sharing the same column), a line of that same color is drawn to connect the two pixels. Pixels that do not form such aligned pairs remain unchanged. The output grid is the input grid with these connecting lines added.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
