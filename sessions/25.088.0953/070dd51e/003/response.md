"""
Transforms the input grid by connecting aligned pairs of same-colored pixels
with lines of that color. The transformation happens in two passes: first,
horizontal lines are drawn, then vertical lines are drawn. If lines intersect,
the color of the vertical line takes precedence, overwriting the horizontal
line's color at the intersection point. Only colors that appear exactly twice
in the input grid form connecting pairs. Pixels not part of a drawn line retain
their original color from the input grid.
