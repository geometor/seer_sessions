            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are 2D grids containing pixels represented by integers 0-9. The examples primarily use white (0) and red (2) in the input, and white (0), red (2), and blue (1) in the output.\n2.  **Objects:** The prominent objects in the input grids are distinct connected components of red (2) pixels. These components often take the shape of a plus sign ('+'), although variations exist (e.g., incomplete '+' shapes or single pixels in example 2). Connectivity appears to be based on orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves adding blue (1) pixels to the input grid while preserving the original red (2) pixels and most of the white (0) background pixels.\n4.  **Pattern:** The blue pixels appear in specific white (0) locations that seem to bridge the gap between *different* red objects. This bridging occurs along straight horizontal or vertical lines. A white pixel turns blue if it lies on a direct, unobstructed path (containing only white pixels) between two red pixels belonging to separate red objects. This applies independently for horizontal and vertical paths.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
