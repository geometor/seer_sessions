**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are 2D grids containing pixels represented by integers 0-9. The examples primarily use white (0) and red (2) in the input, and white (0), red (2), and blue (1) in the output.
2.  **Objects:** The prominent objects in the input grids are distinct connected components of red (2) pixels. These components often take the shape of a plus sign ('+'), although variations exist (e.g., incomplete '+' shapes or single pixels in example 2). Connectivity appears to be based on orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right).
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves adding blue (1) pixels to the input grid while preserving the original red (2) pixels and most of the white (0) background pixels.
4.  **Pattern:** The blue pixels appear in specific white (0) locations that seem to bridge the gap between *different* red objects. This bridging occurs along straight horizontal or vertical lines. A white pixel turns blue if it lies on a direct, unobstructed path (containing only white pixels) between two red pixels belonging to separate red objects. This applies independently for horizontal and vertical paths.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Background: white (0)
  Foreground: red (2)
Objects:
  Type: Connected components of red (2) pixels.
  Connectivity: Orthogonal (up, down, left, right). Adjacent red pixels belong to the same object.
  Shape: Often resemble '+', but can vary.
Transformation:
  Action: Add pixels.
  ColorAdded: blue (1).
  TargetLocations: Specific white (0) pixels.
  Condition:
    - A white pixel at (r, c) is targeted if it lies on a path between two red pixels belonging to *different* objects.
    - Path Criteria:
      - Must be straight (either purely horizontal or purely vertical).
      - Must contain only white (0) pixels between the two endpoint red pixels.
    - Endpoint Criteria:
      - The path must connect a red pixel (r, c_left) or (r_up, c) to another red pixel (r, c_right) or (r_down, c).
      - The two endpoint red pixels must belong to *different* red objects (connected components).
  Preservation: Original red (2) pixels and non-targeted white (0) pixels remain unchanged.
Relationship:
  - The placement of new blue (1) pixels depends on the relative positions and object identities of existing red (2) pixels.
  - Blue pixels act as "bridges" or "fillers" in the white space between distinct red objects along cardinal directions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all distinct connected components (objects) of red (2) pixels in the input grid using orthogonal adjacency. Assign a unique identifier to each red pixel based on the object it belongs to.
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Iterate through every white (0) pixel at coordinates `(r, c)` in the input grid.
4.  For each white pixel `(r, c)`:
    a.  Check **horizontally**:
        i.  Look left along row `r` from `c-1` to find the nearest non-white pixel `(r, c_left)`.
        ii. Look right along row `r` from `c+1` to find the nearest non-white pixel `(r, c_right)`.
        iii. If both `(r, c_left)` and `(r, c_right)` are found, are red (2), and belong to different objects (have different object identifiers), then change the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to blue (1).
    b.  If the pixel `(r, c)` was not changed to blue in the horizontal check, check **vertically**:
        i.  Look up along column `c` from `r-1` to find the nearest non-white pixel `(r_up, c)`.
        ii. Look down along column `c` from `r+1` to find the nearest non-white pixel `(r_down, c)`.
        iii. If both `(r_up, c)` and `(r_down, c)` are found, are red (2), and belong to different objects (have different object identifiers), then change the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to blue (1).
5.  Return the final output grid.
