Grid:
  Background: white (0)
  Foreground: red (2)
Objects:
  Type: Connected components of red (2) pixels.
  Connectivity: Orthogonal (up, down, left, right). Adjacent red pixels belong to the same object.
  Shape: Often resemble '+', but can vary.
Transformation:
  Action: Add pixels.
  ColorAdded: blue (1).
  TargetLocations: Specific white (0) pixels.
  Condition:
    - A white pixel at (r, c) is targeted if it lies on a path between two red pixels belonging to *different* objects.
    - Path Criteria:
      - Must be straight (either purely horizontal or purely vertical).
      - Must contain only white (0) pixels between the two endpoint red pixels.
    - Endpoint Criteria:
      - The path must connect a red pixel (r, c_left) or (r_up, c) to another red pixel (r, c_right) or (r_down, c).
      - The two endpoint red pixels must belong to *different* red objects (connected components).
  Preservation: Original red (2) pixels and non-targeted white (0) pixels remain unchanged.
Relationship:
  - The placement of new blue (1) pixels depends on the relative positions and object identities of existing red (2) pixels.
  - Blue pixels act as "bridges" or "fillers" in the white space between distinct red objects along cardinal directions.
