            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are the same size (17x17).\n2.  **Background and Pattern:** Both grids feature a white (0) background and a repeating pattern of 3x3 azure (8) squares separated by single white rows/columns. The pattern starts at row 1, column 1, and repeats every 4 rows and 4 columns.\n3.  **Input Objects:** In the input grids, besides the white background and azure pattern, there are pairs of single pixels of other colors (red, magenta, blue, orange, green). These colored pixels always appear in pairs of the same color. They are located on the white background cells.\n4.  **Output Transformation:** In the output grids, the background/pattern structure is largely preserved. However, rectangular areas seem to be \"filled\" or \"painted\" with the colors from the input pairs.\n5.  **Fill Logic:**\n    *   The corners of the filled rectangles appear to be defined by the locations of the input color pairs. If a color pair is at (r1, c1) and (r2, c2), the rectangle spans from `min(r1, r2)` to `max(r1, r2)` and `min(c1, c2)` to `max(c1, c2)`, inclusive.\n    *   The fill color matches the color of the pair defining the rectangle.\n    *   The fill affects specific pixels within the rectangle:\n        *   All white (0) pixels within the rectangle are changed to the fill color.\n        *   Azure (8) pixels that are located at the *center* of the 3x3 azure squares (i.e., where `row % 4 == 2` and `col % 4 == 2`) *within* the rectangle are also changed to the fill color.\n    *   Other azure (8) pixels (the 'frame' of the 3x3 squares) and pixels outside the defined rectangles remain unchanged.\n    *   The original colored pixels that define the rectangle corners also retain their color in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
