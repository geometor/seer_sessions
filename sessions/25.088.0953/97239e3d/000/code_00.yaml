grid_properties:
  size: 17x17
  background_color: white (0)
  pattern:
    type: repeating grid
    element: 3x3 square
    element_color: azure (8)
    separation: 1 pixel white (0) border
    periodicity: 4 rows, 4 columns
    anchor: (1, 1) # Top-left corner of the first full 3x3 square

input_elements:
  - type: marker_pixels
    count: variable (always pairs of the same color)
    colors: non-white(0), non-azure(8) (e.g., red(2), magenta(6), blue(1), orange(7), green(3))
    placement: on white(0) background pixels
    role: define rectangular regions

transformation:
  action: fill_rectangle
  target_pixels:
    - condition: color is white(0)
      location: within the rectangle defined by a marker pair
      result: change color to marker pair color
    - condition: color is azure(8) AND row % 4 == 2 AND col % 4 == 2 # Center of 3x3 box
      location: within the rectangle defined by a marker pair
      result: change color to marker pair color
  unchanged_pixels:
    - pixels outside defined rectangles
    - azure(8) pixels forming the frame of the 3x3 boxes (not centers)
    - the original marker pixels themselves

relationships:
  - Each pair of same-colored marker pixels defines one rectangular region.
  - The top-left corner of the rectangle is (min_row, min_col) of the pair.
  - The bottom-right corner of the rectangle is (max_row, max_col) of the pair.
  - The fill color for a rectangle is the color of the marker pair defining it.
