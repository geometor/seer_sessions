"""
Processes an input grid containing a repeating pattern of azure (8) 3x3 squares on a white (0) background.
The transformation identifies pairs of identically colored marker pixels (colors other than white and azure) in the input.
Each pair defines the opposite corners of a rectangle.
Within each defined rectangle, the transformation performs the following fill operation:
1. White (0) pixels are changed to the color of the marker pair.
2. Azure (8) pixels located at the center of the 3x3 azure squares (where row % 4 == 2 and col % 4 == 2) are also changed to the color of the marker pair.
All other pixels, including the original marker pixels and the azure pixels forming the 'frames' of the 3x3 squares, remain unchanged.
