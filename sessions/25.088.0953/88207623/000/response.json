            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Identify Key Colors:** The primary colors involved seem to be yellow (4) and red (2), which form distinct shapes. Other colors like azure (8), green (3), gray (5), and orange (7) appear as isolated pixels in the input and are used as fill colors in the output. White (0) is the background.\n2.  **Identify Core Objects:** The input grids contain one or more \"base shapes\" composed of connected yellow (4) and red (2) pixels. There are also isolated single pixels of other colors (\"marker pixels\").\n3.  **Relationship between Objects:** Each marker pixel appears to be associated with one specific base shape, likely the closest one. The color of the marker pixel dictates the color used for filling.\n4.  **Transformation Action:** The core transformation is a \"fill\" operation. This fill originates from the red (2) pixels within each base shape.\n5.  **Fill Direction:** The direction of the fill (left or right) seems determined by the horizontal position of the associated marker pixel relative to the red pixels of its base shape. If the marker is to the right, the fill goes right. If the marker is to the left, the fill goes left.\n6.  **Fill Boundaries:** The fill operation extends horizontally along the row of each red pixel, replacing white (0) pixels with the marker's color. The fill stops when it hits a non-white pixel or the edge of the grid.\n7.  **Input Persistence:** The original base shapes (yellow and red pixels) remain unchanged in the output. The original marker pixels might be overwritten if the fill operation reaches their location, but their primary role is to define the color and direction of the fill for their associated shape.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Record the locations of all pixels belonging to each shape, paying special attention to the red (2) pixels within each shape.\n2.  **Identify Marker Pixels:** Scan the input grid and identify all isolated non-white pixels that are *not* part of any identified base shape. Record the color and location of each marker pixel.\n3.  **Associate Markers with Shapes:** For each marker pixel, calculate its distance (e.g., Euclidean distance) to the nearest red (2) pixel of every base shape. Associate the marker pixel (and its color) with the base shape containing the closest red pixel.\n4.  **Perform Fill Operation for Each Shape:** Iterate through each base shape that has an associated marker pixel:\n    a.  Retrieve the associated marker pixel's color (this is the `fill_color`).\n    b.  Determine the `fill_direction`: Compare the column index of the marker pixel to the column index(es) of the red (2) pixels in the base shape. If the marker's column index is greater, the direction is right. If it's smaller, the direction is left.\n    c.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    d.  For each red (2) pixel located at `(row, col)` within the current base shape:\n        i.  Determine the starting column for the fill: `start_col = col + 1` if `fill_direction` is right, or `start_col = col - 1` if `fill_direction` is left.\n        ii. Set the current fill column `c` to `start_col`.\n        iii. While `c` is within the grid's horizontal boundaries:\n            1.  Check the pixel at `(row, c)` in the *current state* of the output grid.\n            2.  If the pixel at `(row, c)` is white (0), change it to the `fill_color` in the output grid and update `c` by incrementing (if direction is right) or decrementing (if direction is left).\n            3.  If the pixel at `(row, c)` is *not* white (0), stop filling for this specific red pixel's row.\n            4.  If `c` goes out of bounds, stop filling.\n5.  **Final Output:** The modified output grid after processing all associated base shapes is the result."
