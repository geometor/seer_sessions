elements:
  - type: grid
    description: The input and output are 2D grids of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9.
  - type: color
    value: 0
    name: white
    role: background
  - type: color
    value: 4
    name: yellow
    role: part_of_base_shape
  - type: color
    value: 2
    name: red
    role: part_of_base_shape_origin_of_fill
  - type: color
    value: [3, 5, 7, 8] # green, gray, orange, azure in examples
    name: [green, gray, orange, azure]
    role: fill_color_marker
  - type: object
    name: base_shape
    description: Contiguous areas composed solely of yellow (4) and red (2) pixels.
  - type: object
    name: marker_pixel
    description: Isolated single pixels of a color other than white (0), yellow (4), or red (2). Not connected to any base shape.
  - type: relationship
    name: association
    subject: marker_pixel
    object: base_shape
    rule: Each marker_pixel is associated with the spatially nearest base_shape (specifically, nearest to any of the red pixels within that shape).
  - type: property
    name: fill_color
    description: The color of the associated marker_pixel.
  - type: property
    name: fill_direction
    description: Determined by the horizontal position of the marker_pixel relative to the red (2) pixels of its associated base_shape. If the marker is in a column to the right, direction is 'right'. If to the left, direction is 'left'.
  - type: action
    name: fill
    origin: Each red (2) pixel in a base_shape.
    color: The fill_color from the associated marker_pixel.
    direction: The fill_direction determined by the associated marker_pixel.
    extent: Horizontally along the row of the origin red pixel, replacing white (0) pixels.
    termination: Stops upon encountering a non-white pixel or the grid boundary.
