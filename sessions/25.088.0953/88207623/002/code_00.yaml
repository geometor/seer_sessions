task_description: Perform a directional color fill originating from red pixels within specific shapes, controlled by nearby marker pixels.

definitions:
  - object: base_shape
    description: A contiguous group of pixels composed exclusively of yellow (4) and/or red (2) pixels, which must contain at least one red (2) pixel.
    properties:
      - pixels: Set of (row, col) coordinates of all constituent pixels.
      - red_pixels: List of (row, col) coordinates of the red (2) pixels within the shape. Sorted top-to-bottom, then left-to-right.
  - object: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel that is not white (0), not yellow (4), not red (2), and is not part of any base_shape.
    properties:
      - location: (row, col) coordinate.
      - color: The integer color value (e.g., 3, 5, 7, 8).

process:
  - step: 1. Identify Objects
    action: Detect all base_shapes and marker_pixels in the input grid.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - list_of_base_shapes
      - list_of_marker_pixels

  - step: 2. Associate Markers to Shapes
    action: For each marker_pixel, find the base_shape whose red_pixels are closest (minimum Euclidean distance) to the marker_pixel's location. A marker can only associate with one shape, and a shape can only be associated with its single closest marker.
    inputs:
      - list_of_base_shapes
      - list_of_marker_pixels
    outputs:
      - shape_marker_associations: A map where keys are base_shape identifiers and values are the associated marker_pixel.

  - step: 3. Determine Fill Properties per Association
    action: For each associated (base_shape, marker_pixel) pair:
            a. Determine the fill_color from the marker_pixel's color.
            b. Determine the fill_direction (left: -1, right: +1) based on whether the marker_pixel's column is less than or greater than the column of the reference red pixel (e.g., the first red pixel in the sorted list for the shape).
    inputs:
      - shape_marker_associations
    outputs:
      - fill_instructions: A list/map containing (base_shape, fill_color, fill_direction) for each association.

  - step: 4. Perform Fill
    action: Create a copy of the input grid. For each instruction in fill_instructions: iterate through every red_pixel location (r, c) in the corresponding base_shape. Starting from the column `c + fill_direction`, move horizontally in the fill_direction. For each step, check the pixel at the target location (r, fill_c) in the *current state* of the output grid. If the target location is within grid bounds AND contains a white (0) pixel, change its color to the fill_color. Continue stepping until the target location is outside the grid bounds OR the pixel at the target location is non-white (1-9). Repeat for all red_pixels in the shape, and for all associated shapes.
    inputs:
      - input_grid (as initial state for output_grid)
      - fill_instructions
    outputs:
      - output_grid: The modified grid after all fills are completed.

constraints:
  - Fill action stops immediately upon encountering a non-white pixel or grid boundary.
  - Only base_shapes associated with a marker_pixel are subject to the fill process.
  - Markers must be non-white, non-yellow, and non-red.
