Transformation Rule:

1.  **Identify Base Shapes:** Find connected components composed exclusively of yellow (4) and red (2) pixels. Note the locations of all pixels, especially the red (2) ones, within each shape.
2.  **Identify Marker Pixels:** Find isolated pixels that are not white (0) and are not part of any identified base shape. These are the marker pixels.
3.  **Associate Markers with Shapes:** For each marker pixel, determine the base shape it is closest to (based on Euclidean distance between the marker and the red pixels of the shapes). Each marker is associated with at most one shape, and each shape is associated with at most one marker (the closest one).
4.  **Determine Fill Properties:** For each shape associated with a marker:
    a.  The `fill_color` is the color of the associated marker pixel.
    b.  The `fill_direction` is determined by the marker's horizontal position relative to the red pixels of the shape. If the marker's column index is greater than the red pixel(s)' column index(es), the direction is 'right'. Otherwise, it's 'left'. (If multiple red pixels exist, comparison can be made to any, e.g., the topmost, leftmost red pixel).
5.  **Perform Fill:** Create a copy of the input grid. For each red (2) pixel in an associated base shape:
    a.  Starting from the column immediately adjacent to the red pixel in the determined `fill_direction`, iterate horizontally.
    b.  Replace any white (0) pixel encountered with the `fill_color`.
    c.  Stop filling along that row when a non-white pixel or the grid boundary is reached.
6.  **Output:** Return the modified grid after all fills are completed.
