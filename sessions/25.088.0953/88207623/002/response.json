The current code fills all white (0) pixels horizontally from the red pixel in the determined direction until the grid boundary is reached. However, the `Expected Output` grids clearly show that the fill process **must stop** not only at the boundary but also when it encounters any **non-white (non-zero) pixel**.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the fill loop to check the color of the *next* pixel *before* filling it. If the pixel is white (0), fill it and continue. If it's non-white (1-9) or the grid boundary is reached, stop the fill for that specific row originating from that specific red pixel.\n\n**Metrics & Observations**\n"

These yellow pixels are *not* part of the contiguous yellow/red shapes.\n*   **Example 2:** The analysis found 4 markers. Besides the gray (5) at (5, 4) and orange (7) at (13, 9), it found yellow (4) pixels at (1, 10) and (2, 11).\n\nLooking at the expected outputs again:\n*   Example 1: Only the azure (8) and green (3) pixels trigger fills. The isolated yellow (4) pixels do not.\n*   Example 2: Only the gray (5) and orange (7) pixels trigger fills. The isolated yellow (4) pixels do not.\n\n**Revised Observation:** It seems the definition of a \"marker\" needs refinement. It's not *any* isolated non-white, non-base-shape pixel. It appears markers must *not* be yellow (4) or red (2), the colors used in the base shapes themselves.\n\n**Revised Metrics (based on manual inspection and the expected output logic):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (14, 16)\n    *   Base Shapes (Yellow/Red with Red): 2\n    *   True Markers (Isolated, non-white, non-yellow, non-red): 2 (Azure at (3, 9), Green at (10, 13))\n    *   Association: Top shape -> Azure; Bottom shape -> Green.\n    *   Fill Directions: Top shape fills Right; Bottom shape fills Right.\n    *   Fill Stopping: Fill stops at grid boundary OR any non-white pixel.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (16, 16)\n    *   Base Shapes (Yellow/Red with Red): 2\n    *   True Markers (Isolated, non-white, non-yellow, non-red): 2 (Gray at (5, 4), Orange at (13, 9))\n    *   Association: Top shape -> Gray; Bottom shape -> Orange.\n    *   Fill Directions: Top shape fills Left; Bottom shape fills Right.\n    *   Fill Stopping: Fill stops at grid boundary OR any non-white pixel.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Associate the marker with the base shape containing the closest red pixel. If multiple markers are closest to the same shape, only associate the one with the absolute minimum distance. If a single marker is equidistant to red pixels in different shapes, the association might be ambiguous (though not observed in examples, could default to the first shape found or lowest shape ID). Each shape can be associated with at most one marker (the closest one).\n4.  **Determine Fill Properties:** For each base shape that has an associated marker:\n    *   Note the `fill_color`, which is the color of the associated marker pixel.\n    *   Determine the `fill_direction`: If the marker pixel's column index is greater than the column index of a reference red pixel within the shape (e.g., the topmost, then leftmost red pixel), the direction is 'right' (+1).
