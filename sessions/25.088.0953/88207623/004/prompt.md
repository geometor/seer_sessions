Transformation Rule:

1.  **Identify Base Shapes:** Find all connected components (objects) in the input grid consisting solely of yellow (4) and red (2) pixels, ensuring each component includes at least one red pixel. Record the locations of all pixels in each shape, paying special attention to the locations of the red pixels (sorted top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
2.  **Identify Marker Pixels:** Locate all single pixels in the grid that are *not* white (0), *not* yellow (4), *not* red (2), and do *not* belong to any identified base shape. These are the marker pixels. Record their location and color.
3.  **Associate Markers with Shapes:** For each marker pixel, determine the base shape it is closest to (based on minimum Euclidean distance between the marker's location and any red pixel within the shape). Ensure each marker is associated with at most one shape (the closest), and each shape is associated with at most one marker (the closest one to it).
4.  **Determine Fill Properties:** For each base shape successfully associated with a marker:
    a.  The `fill_color` is the color of the associated marker pixel.
    b.  The `fill_direction` is determined by the marker's horizontal position relative to a reference red pixel of the shape (e.g., the first one in the sorted list). If the marker's column index is greater than the red pixel's column index, the direction is 'right' (+1). Otherwise, it's 'left' (-1).
5.  **Perform Fill:** Create a copy of the input grid. For each associated (shape, marker) pair, iterate through every red pixel `(r, c)` within that shape. Starting from the column `c + fill_direction`, move horizontally in the `fill_direction`. At each step `fill_c`, check the pixel at `(r, fill_c)` in the *current state* of the output grid. If the location is within bounds and the pixel is white (0), change it to the `fill_color`. Stop filling along row `r` (originating from that specific red pixel `(r, c)`) as soon as a non-white (1-9) pixel is encountered or the grid boundary is reached.
6.  **Output:** Return the modified grid after all fills are completed.
