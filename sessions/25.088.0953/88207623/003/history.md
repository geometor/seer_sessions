Transformation Rule:

1.  **Identify Base Shapes:** Find connected components composed exclusively of yellow (4) and red (2) pixels. Note the locations of all pixels, especially the red (2) ones, within each shape.
2.  **Identify Marker Pixels:** Find isolated pixels that are not white (0) and are not part of any identified base shape. These are the marker pixels.
3.  **Associate Markers with Shapes:** For each marker pixel, determine the base shape it is closest to (based on Euclidean distance between the marker and the red pixels of the shapes). Each marker is associated with at most one shape, and each shape is associated with at most one marker (the closest one).
4.  **Determine Fill Properties:** For each shape associated with a marker:
    a.  The `fill_color` is the color of the associated marker pixel.
    b.  The `fill_direction` is determined by the marker's horizontal position relative to the red pixels of the shape. If the marker's column index is greater than the red pixel(s)' column index(es), the direction is 'right'. Otherwise, it's 'left'. (If multiple red pixels exist, comparison can be made to any, e.g., the topmost, leftmost red pixel).
5.  **Perform Fill:** Create a copy of the input grid. For each red (2) pixel in an associated base shape:
    a.  Starting from the column immediately adjacent to the red pixel in the determined `fill_direction`, iterate horizontally.
    b.  Replace any white (0) pixel encountered with the `fill_color`.
    c.  Stop filling along that row when a non-white pixel or the grid boundary is reached.
6.  **Output:** Return the modified grid after all fills are completed.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.

**General Assessment & Strategy**

The previous code correctly identified the core components of the task:
1.  **Base Shapes:** Connected components of yellow (4) and red (2) pixels.
2.  **Marker Pixels:** Isolated, non-white pixels not part of base shapes.
3.  **Association:** Linking markers to the nearest base shape (using red pixels as anchors).
4.  **Fill Properties:** Determining fill color (from marker) and direction (marker's horizontal position relative to red pixels).

The primary error lies in the **fill execution logic**. The current code fills all white (0) pixels horizontally from the red pixel in the determined direction until the grid boundary is reached. However, the `Expected Output` grids clearly show that the fill process **must stop** not only at the boundary but also when it encounters any **non-white (non-zero) pixel**.

The strategy is to modify the fill loop to check the color of the *next* pixel *before* filling it. If the pixel is white (0), fill it and continue. If it's non-white (1-9) or the grid boundary is reached, stop the fill for that specific row originating from that specific red pixel.

**Wait!** The analysis script identified *more* markers than expected. Let's re-read the definition: "Find isolated pixels that are not white (0) and are not part of any identified base shape."

*   **Example 1:** The analysis found 7 markers. Besides the azure (8) at (3, 9) and green (3) at (10, 13), it found several yellow (4) pixels at (10, 9), (11, 7), (11, 8), (12, 8), (12, 9). These yellow pixels are *not* part of the contiguous yellow/red shapes.
*   **Example 2:** The analysis found 4 markers. Besides the gray (5) at (5, 4) and orange (7) at (13, 9), it found yellow (4) pixels at (1, 10) and (2, 11).

Looking at the expected outputs again:
*   Example 1: Only the azure (8) and green (3) pixels trigger fills. The isolated yellow (4) pixels do not.
*   Example 2: Only the gray (5) and orange (7) pixels trigger fills. The isolated yellow (4) pixels do not.

**Revised Observation:** It seems the definition of a "marker" needs refinement. It's not *any* isolated non-white, non-base-shape pixel. It appears markers must *not* be yellow (4) or red (2), the colors used in the base shapes themselves.

**Revised Metrics (based on manual inspection and the expected output logic):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (14, 16)
    *   Base Shapes (Yellow/Red with Red): 2
    *   True Markers (Isolated, non-white, non-yellow, non-red): 2 (Azure at (3, 9), Green at (10, 13))
    *   Association: Top shape -> Azure; Bottom shape -> Green.
    *   Fill Directions: Top shape fills Right; Bottom shape fills Right.
    *   Fill Stopping: Fill stops at grid boundary OR any non-white pixel.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (16, 16)
    *   Base Shapes (Yellow/Red with Red): 2
    *   True Markers (Isolated, non-white, non-yellow, non-red): 2 (Gray at (5, 4), Orange at (13, 9))
    *   Association: Top shape -> Gray; Bottom shape -> Orange.
    *   Fill Directions: Top shape fills Left; Bottom shape fills Right.
    *   Fill Stopping: Fill stops at grid boundary OR any non-white pixel.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_description: Perform a directional color fill originating from red pixels within specific shapes, controlled by nearby marker pixels.

definitions:
  - object: base_shape
    description: A contiguous group of pixels composed exclusively of yellow (4) and/or red (2) pixels, which must contain at least one red (2) pixel.
    properties:
      - pixels: Set of (row, col) coordinates of all constituent pixels.
      - red_pixels: List of (row, col) coordinates of the red (2) pixels within the shape. Sorted top-to-bottom, then left-to-right.
  - object: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel that is not white (0), not yellow (4), not red (2), and is not part of any base_shape.
    properties:
      - location: (row, col) coordinate.
      - color: The integer color value (e.g., 3, 5, 7, 8).

process:
  - step: 1. Identify Objects
    action: Detect all base_shapes and marker_pixels in the input grid.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - list_of_base_shapes
      - list_of_marker_pixels

  - step: 2. Associate Markers to Shapes
    action: For each marker_pixel, find the base_shape whose red_pixels are closest (minimum Euclidean distance) to the marker_pixel's location. A marker can only associate with one shape, and a shape can only be associated with its single closest marker.
    inputs:
      - list_of_base_shapes
      - list_of_marker_pixels
    outputs:
      - shape_marker_associations: A map where keys are base_shape identifiers and values are the associated marker_pixel.

  - step: 3. Determine Fill Properties per Association
    action: For each associated (base_shape, marker_pixel) pair:
            a. Determine the fill_color from the marker_pixel's color.
            b. Determine the fill_direction (left: -1, right: +1) based on whether the marker_pixel's column is less than or greater than the column of the reference red pixel (e.g., the first red pixel in the sorted list for the shape).
    inputs:
      - shape_marker_associations
    outputs:
      - fill_instructions: A list/map containing (base_shape, fill_color, fill_direction) for each association.

  - step: 4. Perform Fill
    action: Create a copy of the input grid. For each instruction in fill_instructions: iterate through every red_pixel location (r, c) in the corresponding base_shape. Starting from the column `c + fill_direction`, move horizontally in the fill_direction. For each step, check the pixel at the target location (r, fill_c) in the *current state* of the output grid. If the target location is within grid bounds AND contains a white (0) pixel, change its color to the fill_color. Continue stepping until the target location is outside the grid bounds OR the pixel at the target location is non-white (1-9). Repeat for all red_pixels in the shape, and for all associated shapes.
    inputs:
      - input_grid (as initial state for output_grid)
      - fill_instructions
    outputs:
      - output_grid: The modified grid after all fills are completed.

constraints:
  - Fill action stops immediately upon encountering a non-white pixel or grid boundary.
  - Only base_shapes associated with a marker_pixel are subject to the fill process.
  - Markers must be non-white, non-yellow, and non-red.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Base Shapes:** Find all connected components (objects) in the input grid consisting solely of yellow (4) and red (2) pixels, ensuring each component includes at least one red pixel. Record the locations of all pixels in each shape, paying special attention to the locations of the red pixels.
2.  **Identify Marker Pixels:** Locate all single pixels in the grid that are *not* white (0), *not* yellow (4), *not* red (2), and do *not* belong to any identified base shape. These are the marker pixels. Record their location and color.
3.  **Associate Markers with Shapes:** For each marker pixel, calculate the Euclidean distance to every red pixel in every base shape. Associate the marker with the base shape containing the closest red pixel. If multiple markers are closest to the same shape, only associate the one with the absolute minimum distance. If a single marker is equidistant to red pixels in different shapes, the association might be ambiguous (though not observed in examples, could default to the first shape found or lowest shape ID). Each shape can be associated with at most one marker (the closest one).
4.  **Determine Fill Properties:** For each base shape that has an associated marker:
    *   Note the `fill_color`, which is the color of the associated marker pixel.
    *   Determine the `fill_direction`: If the marker pixel's column index is greater than the column index of a reference red pixel within the shape (e.g., the topmost, then leftmost red pixel), the direction is 'right' (+1). Otherwise, it's 'left' (-1).
5.  **Perform Fill:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid. For each red pixel `(r, c)` belonging to a base shape that has an associated marker:
    *   Initialize the fill column `fill_c = c + fill_direction`.
    *   **Loop:** While `fill_c` is within the grid's horizontal bounds (0 <= `fill_c` < width):
        *   Check the color of the pixel at `(r, fill_c)` in the *current* output grid.
        *   If the pixel color is white (0), change it to the `fill_color`.
        *   If the pixel color is *not* white (0), **stop** filling along this row `r` for this specific red pixel `(r, c)`.
        *   Increment `fill_c` by `fill_direction` to move to the next column.
        *   If the loop condition (`fill_c` within bounds) fails, stop filling for this row `r`.
    *   Repeat this process for every red pixel within the associated base shape.
    *   Repeat for all base shape-marker associations.
6.  **Output:** Return the final modified output grid.
