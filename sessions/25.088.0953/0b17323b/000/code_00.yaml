Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Size: Variable (15x15 in examples)
    - Background_Color: white (0)
  Objects:
    - Type: Pixel
      Color: blue (1)
      Quantity: Variable (3 in examples)
      Arrangement:
        - Lie on the main diagonal (row == col).
        - Form an arithmetic progression with a constant step (s, s).
Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Size: Same as Input_Grid
    - Background_Color: white (0)
  Objects:
    - Type: Pixel
      Color: blue (1)
      Source: Copied directly from Input_Grid.
      Quantity: Same as Input_Grid.
      Arrangement: Same as Input_Grid.
    - Type: Pixel
      Color: red (2)
      Source: Added based on blue pixel pattern.
      Quantity: Variable (Determined by rule).
      Arrangement:
        - Lie on the main diagonal (row == col).
        - Form an arithmetic progression with the same step (s, s) as the blue pixels.
Relationships:
  - Identity: The blue pixels in the output are identical in position and color to those in the input.
  - Generation: The red pixels are generated based on the blue pixels.
  - Spatial_Sequence:
    - The blue pixels define a sequence with a start position, step (s, s), and count.
    - The red pixels define a sequence that:
      - Starts at the position of the last blue pixel + step (s, s).
      - Uses the same step (s, s).
      - Continues as long as the pixel coordinates are within the grid boundaries.
