The background is white (0).\n2.  **Blue Pixels (1):** The input contains a small number (3 in the examples) of isolated blue pixels. These blue pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.\n3.  **Pattern of Blue Pixels:** In both examples, the blue pixels lie on the main diagonal (row index equals column index). Furthermore, they form an arithmetic sequence: the difference in coordinates between consecutive blue pixels (when ordered by position) is constant. Let this step be (s, s).\n4.  **Red Pixels (2):** The output grid contains new red pixels that were not present in the input. The blue pixels are *not* replaced by red pixels; the red pixels are added.\n5.  **Pattern of Red Pixels:** The added red pixels also lie on the main diagonal and follow the same arithmetic step (s, s) as the blue pixels.\n6.  **Origin of Red Pattern:** The sequence of red pixels starts immediately after the last blue pixel in the sequence, offset by the step (s, s). Specifically, if the last blue pixel is at (lr, lc), the first red pixel is at (lr + s, lc + s).\n7.  **Extent of Red Pattern:** The red pixel sequence continues with step (s, s) as long as the pixel coordinates remain within the bounds of the grid. The number of red pixels added depends on the starting position and the step size relative to the grid dimensions.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
