**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output grids are the same size (15x15 in the examples). The background is white (0).
2.  **Blue Pixels (1):** The input contains a small number (3 in the examples) of isolated blue pixels. These blue pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.
3.  **Pattern of Blue Pixels:** In both examples, the blue pixels lie on the main diagonal (row index equals column index). Furthermore, they form an arithmetic sequence: the difference in coordinates between consecutive blue pixels (when ordered by position) is constant. Let this step be (s, s).
4.  **Red Pixels (2):** The output grid contains new red pixels that were not present in the input. The blue pixels are *not* replaced by red pixels; the red pixels are added.
5.  **Pattern of Red Pixels:** The added red pixels also lie on the main diagonal and follow the same arithmetic step (s, s) as the blue pixels.
6.  **Origin of Red Pattern:** The sequence of red pixels starts immediately after the last blue pixel in the sequence, offset by the step (s, s). Specifically, if the last blue pixel is at (lr, lc), the first red pixel is at (lr + s, lc + s).
7.  **Extent of Red Pattern:** The red pixel sequence continues with step (s, s) as long as the pixel coordinates remain within the bounds of the grid. The number of red pixels added depends on the starting position and the step size relative to the grid dimensions.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Size: Variable (15x15 in examples)
    - Background_Color: white (0)
  Objects:
    - Type: Pixel
      Color: blue (1)
      Quantity: Variable (3 in examples)
      Arrangement:
        - Lie on the main diagonal (row == col).
        - Form an arithmetic progression with a constant step (s, s).
Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Size: Same as Input_Grid
    - Background_Color: white (0)
  Objects:
    - Type: Pixel
      Color: blue (1)
      Source: Copied directly from Input_Grid.
      Quantity: Same as Input_Grid.
      Arrangement: Same as Input_Grid.
    - Type: Pixel
      Color: red (2)
      Source: Added based on blue pixel pattern.
      Quantity: Variable (Determined by rule).
      Arrangement:
        - Lie on the main diagonal (row == col).
        - Form an arithmetic progression with the same step (s, s) as the blue pixels.
Relationships:
  - Identity: The blue pixels in the output are identical in position and color to those in the input.
  - Generation: The red pixels are generated based on the blue pixels.
  - Spatial_Sequence:
    - The blue pixels define a sequence with a start position, step (s, s), and count.
    - The red pixels define a sequence that:
      - Starts at the position of the last blue pixel + step (s, s).
      - Uses the same step (s, s).
      - Continues as long as the pixel coordinates are within the grid boundaries.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all blue pixels in the input grid.
2.  Verify that the blue pixels lie on the main diagonal and form an arithmetic progression. If not, return a copy of the input grid.
3.  Calculate the step size `s` (the difference in row/column index between consecutive blue pixels). If there are fewer than two blue pixels, return a copy of the input grid.
4.  Find the coordinates `(lr, lc)` of the blue pixel with the largest row/column index (the last one in the sequence).
5.  Initialize the starting position for the first red pixel: `(current_r, current_c) = (lr + s, lc + s)`.
6.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
7.  While the `current_r` and `current_c` coordinates are within the grid boundaries (i.e., `0 <= current_r < grid_height` and `0 <= current_c < grid_width`):
    a.  Set the pixel at `(current_r, current_c)` in the output grid copy to red (2).
    b.  Update the coordinates for the next potential red pixel: `current_r = current_r + s`, `current_c = current_c + s`.
8.  Return the modified output grid copy.
