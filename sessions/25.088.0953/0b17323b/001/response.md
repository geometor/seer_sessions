```python
"""
Identifies a sequence of blue pixels (1) on the main diagonal of the input grid that form an arithmetic progression.
It calculates the step size (s, s) of this progression.
Then, it extends this sequence by adding red pixels (2) starting from the position after the last blue pixel, continuing with the same step size (s, s) as long as the coordinates remain within the grid boundaries.
The original blue pixels are preserved in the output. If no valid blue pixel sequence is found (fewer than two blue pixels, not on the diagonal, or not forming an arithmetic progression), the input grid is returned unchanged.
