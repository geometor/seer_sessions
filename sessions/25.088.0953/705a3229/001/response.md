"""
Transforms the input grid by finding each non-white pixel and drawing two lines 
emanating from it towards the two nearest grid edges. The lines are drawn in the 
same color as the source pixel. Distances to edges are calculated orthogonally 
(top, bottom, left, right). Ties in distance are broken using the priority order: 
Top, Left, Bottom, Right.
