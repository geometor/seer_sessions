The transformation adds lines extending from each original non-white pixel. These lines are always orthogonal (horizontal and vertical) and use the same color as the source pixel. The lines extend towards the two nearest edges of the grid from the source pixel's location.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
