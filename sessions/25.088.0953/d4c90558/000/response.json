Inside the hollow space of each container, there are one or more gray pixels. The output grid summarizes information about these containers and their contained gray pixels. Each row in the output corresponds to one container from the input. The color of the row is the color of the container, and the number of colored cells in the row equals the number of gray pixels found inside that container. The rows in the output grid are sorted based on the count of contained gray pixels, in ascending order. The width of the output grid is determined by the maximum number of gray pixels found in any single container.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
