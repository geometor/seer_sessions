Transformation Rule:
1. Define the "control region" as the top-left 4x4 subgrid.
2. Find the unique color within the control region that is neither gray (5) nor white (0). This is the "indicator color".
3. Create a copy of the input grid.
4. Iterate through all pixels *outside* the control region.
5. If a pixel outside the control region has the same color as the "indicator color", change its color to white (0) in the copied grid.
6. All other pixels (inside the control region, or outside but not matching the indicator color) remain unchanged.
7. Return the modified grid.
