Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are consistently 15x15 grids.
2.  **Static Element:** There's a prominent gray (5) 'L' shape object in the top-left corner (specifically rows 0-3, columns 0-3) which remains unchanged in all examples.
3.  **Scattered Pixels:** Various other colored pixels are scattered throughout the rest of the grid.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing *some* of the scattered colored pixels to white (0) in the output. The gray 'L' shape is never altered.
5.  **Determining Change:** By comparing input and output pairs, it appears the decision of which pixels to change depends on a specific color found within the top-left 4x4 area (where the gray 'L' shape resides).
    *   In `train_1`, a red (2) pixel is inside the 4x4 area. Red pixels *outside* this area are removed.
    *   In `train_2`, a yellow (4) pixel is inside the 4x4 area. Yellow pixels *outside* this area are removed.
    *   In `train_3`, a green (3) pixel is inside the 4x4 area. Green pixels *outside* this area are removed.
6.  **Rule Identification:** The rule seems to be: Identify the single non-gray, non-white pixel within the top-left 4x4 subgrid. Then, find all pixels of that *same color* located *outside* this 4x4 subgrid and change their color to white (0). All other pixels remain untouched.

      - [3, 2]
    role: static background element, potentially part of the control mechanism boundary.
  - id: indicator_pixel
    description: The single pixel within the control_region that is not gray (5) and not white (0).
    properties:
      - color: varies (red(2) in train_1, yellow(4) in train_2, green(3) in train_3)
      - location: always within control_region
    role: Determines the target color for removal outside the control region.
  - id: target_pixels
    description: Pixels located outside the control_region whose color matches the indicator_pixel's color.
    location: outside control_region
    properties:
      - color: matches indicator_pixel color
    role: These are the pixels to be modified.
  - id: unaffected_pixels
    description: All other pixels, including the static_L_shape, the indicator_pixel, pixels outside the control_region with different colors, and white (0) background pixels.
    role: Remain unchanged in the output.

actions:
  - name: find_indicator_color
    inputs:
      - control_region grid data
    outputs:
      - target_color (color of the indicator_pixel)
    condition: Finds the unique non-gray (5), non-white (0) pixel color within the control_region.
  - name: remove_target_pixels
    inputs:
      - full input grid
      - target_color
      - control_region definition
    outputs:
      - modified output grid
    process: Iterate through pixels outside the control_region. If a pixel's color equals target_color, change it to white (0). Otherwise, keep the original color. Copy pixels within the control_region directly.

relationships:
  - type: control
    from: indicator_pixel
    to: target_pixels
    description: The color of the indicator_pixel determines which pixels outside the control_region are designated as target_pixels.
  - type: location_constraint
    object: target_pixels
    constraint: Must be outside the control_region.
  - type: color_constraint
    object: target_pixels
    constraint: Must match the color derived from find_indicator_color action.

transformation:
  - description: Conditional removal based on indicator color.
  - steps:
    1. Identify the control_region (top-left 4x4).
    2. Perform find_indicator_color action within the control_region.
    3. Perform remove_target_pixels action on the rest of the grid based on the found target_color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Define the "control region" as the 4x4 subgrid located at the top-left corner of the input grid (rows 0 through 3, columns 0 through 3).
2.  Examine all pixels within the control region. Find the single pixel whose color is *not* gray (5) and *not* white (0). Record the color of this pixel; let's call it the `indicator_color`. (If no such pixel exists, the output grid is identical to the input grid).
3.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
4.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid located *outside* the control region (i.e., where the row index is greater than 3 OR the column index is greater than 3).
5.  For each of these external pixels, check if its color matches the `indicator_color` found in step 2.
6.  If an external pixel's color matches the `indicator_color`, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).
7.  Pixels within the control region, and pixels outside the control region whose color does *not* match the `indicator_color`, remain unchanged in the output grid (they retain their original color from the input grid).
8.  The final modified grid is the result.
