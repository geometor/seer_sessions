grid_properties:
  - size: [15, 15]

regions:
  - name: control_region
    type: subgrid
    location: top-left
    bounding_box:
      rows: [0, 3]
      columns: [0, 3]

objects:
  - id: static_L_shape
    color: gray (5)
    location: within control_region
    pixels:
      - [0, 3]
      - [1, 3]
      - [2, 3]
      - [3, 3]
      - [3, 0]
      - [3, 1]
      - [3, 2]
    role: static background element, potentially part of the control mechanism boundary.
  - id: indicator_pixel
    description: The single pixel within the control_region that is not gray (5) and not white (0).
    properties:
      - color: varies (red(2) in train_1, yellow(4) in train_2, green(3) in train_3)
      - location: always within control_region
    role: Determines the target color for removal outside the control region.
  - id: target_pixels
    description: Pixels located outside the control_region whose color matches the indicator_pixel's color.
    location: outside control_region
    properties:
      - color: matches indicator_pixel color
    role: These are the pixels to be modified.
  - id: unaffected_pixels
    description: All other pixels, including the static_L_shape, the indicator_pixel, pixels outside the control_region with different colors, and white (0) background pixels.
    role: Remain unchanged in the output.

actions:
  - name: find_indicator_color
    inputs:
      - control_region grid data
    outputs:
      - target_color (color of the indicator_pixel)
    condition: Finds the unique non-gray (5), non-white (0) pixel color within the control_region.
  - name: remove_target_pixels
    inputs:
      - full input grid
      - target_color
      - control_region definition
    outputs:
      - modified output grid
    process: Iterate through pixels outside the control_region. If a pixel's color equals target_color, change it to white (0). Otherwise, keep the original color. Copy pixels within the control_region directly.

relationships:
  - type: control
    from: indicator_pixel
    to: target_pixels
    description: The color of the indicator_pixel determines which pixels outside the control_region are designated as target_pixels.
  - type: location_constraint
    object: target_pixels
    constraint: Must be outside the control_region.
  - type: color_constraint
    object: target_pixels
    constraint: Must match the color derived from find_indicator_color action.

transformation:
  - description: Conditional removal based on indicator color.
  - steps:
    1. Identify the control_region (top-left 4x4).
    2. Perform find_indicator_color action within the control_region.
    3. Perform remove_target_pixels action on the rest of the grid based on the found target_color.
