            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are consistently 15x15 grids.\n2.  **Static Element:** There's a prominent gray (5) 'L' shape object in the top-left corner (specifically rows 0-3, columns 0-3) which remains unchanged in all examples.\n3.  **Scattered Pixels:** Various other colored pixels are scattered throughout the rest of the grid.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing *some* of the scattered colored pixels to white (0) in the output. The gray 'L' shape is never altered.\n5.  **Determining Change:** By comparing input and output pairs, it appears the decision of which pixels to change depends on a specific color found within the top-left 4x4 area (where the gray 'L' shape resides).\n    *   In `train_1`, a red (2) pixel is inside the 4x4 area. Red pixels *outside* this area are removed.\n    *   In `train_2`, a yellow (4) pixel is inside the 4x4 area. Yellow pixels *outside* this area are removed.\n    *   In `train_3`, a green (3) pixel is inside the 4x4 area. Green pixels *outside* this area are removed.\n6.  **Rule Identification:** The rule seems to be: Identify the single non-gray, non-white pixel within the top-left 4x4 subgrid. Then, find all pixels of that *same color* located *outside* this 4x4 subgrid and change their color to white (0). All other pixels remain untouched.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Define the \"control region\" as the 4x4 subgrid located at the top-left corner of the input grid (rows 0 through 3, columns 0 through 3).\n2.  Examine all pixels within the control region. Find the single pixel whose color is *not* gray (5) and *not* white (0). Record the color of this pixel; let's call it the `indicator_color`. (If no such pixel exists, the output grid is identical to the input grid).\n3.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.\n4.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid located *outside* the control region (i.e., where the row index is greater than 3 OR the column index is greater than 3).\n5.  For each of these external pixels, check if its color matches the `indicator_color` found in step 2.\n6.  If an external pixel's color matches the `indicator_color`, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).\n7.  Pixels within the control region, and pixels outside the control region whose color does *not* match the `indicator_color`, remain unchanged in the output grid (they retain their original color from the input grid).\n8.  The final modified grid is the result."
