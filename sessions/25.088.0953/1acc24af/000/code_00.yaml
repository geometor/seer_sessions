Task: Change the color of specific gray pixels based on their neighborhood.

Input_Components:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (0-9).
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Objects:
      - Type: Blue_Shape
        Color: blue (1)
        Properties: Composed of one or more contiguous blue pixels. Static position.
      - Type: Gray_Shape/Pixel
        Color: gray (5)
        Properties: Composed of one or more contiguous gray pixels. Can be single pixels or larger shapes.

Output_Components:
  - Grid: Modified version of the input grid.
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Objects:
      - Type: Blue_Shape
        Color: blue (1)
        Properties: Unchanged from input.
      - Type: Gray_Shape/Pixel
        Color: gray (5)
        Properties: Subset of the original gray pixels; specifically those adjacent (cardinally or diagonally) to at least one blue pixel in the input.
      - Type: Red_Shape/Pixel
        Color: red (2)
        Properties: Occupy the positions of original gray pixels that were *not* adjacent (cardinally or diagonally) to any blue pixel in the input.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Action: Conditional color change.
  - Target: Pixels with color gray (5).
  - Condition: A gray pixel changes color if and only if none of its 8 neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) have the color blue (1).
  - Resulting_Color: If the condition is met, the gray (5) pixel becomes red (2). Otherwise, it remains gray (5).
  - Other_Pixels: All non-gray pixels remain unchanged.
