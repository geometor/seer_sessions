The only difference lies in the color of *some* of the gray pixels.\n3.  **Transformation Observation:** Certain gray pixels (5) in the input are changed to red (2) in the output, while others remain gray.\n4.  **Key Relationship:** The determining factor for whether a gray pixel changes color seems to be its proximity to blue pixels. Specifically, gray pixels that are *not* adjacent (including diagonally) to any blue pixel change to red. Gray pixels that have at least one blue neighbor (cardinal or diagonal) retain their gray color.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
