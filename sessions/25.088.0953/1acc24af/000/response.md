Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid consists of a white (0) background, one or more blue (1) shapes, and one or more gray (5) shapes or individual pixels.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is identical to the input grid in terms of shape positions and the blue shapes. The only difference lies in the color of *some* of the gray pixels.
3.  **Transformation Observation:** Certain gray pixels (5) in the input are changed to red (2) in the output, while others remain gray.
4.  **Key Relationship:** The determining factor for whether a gray pixel changes color seems to be its proximity to blue pixels. Specifically, gray pixels that are *not* adjacent (including diagonally) to any blue pixel change to red. Gray pixels that have at least one blue neighbor (cardinal or diagonal) retain their gray color.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Change the color of specific gray pixels based on their neighborhood.

Input_Components:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (0-9).
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Objects:
      - Type: Blue_Shape
        Color: blue (1)
        Properties: Composed of one or more contiguous blue pixels. Static position.
      - Type: Gray_Shape/Pixel
        Color: gray (5)
        Properties: Composed of one or more contiguous gray pixels. Can be single pixels or larger shapes.

Output_Components:
  - Grid: Modified version of the input grid.
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Objects:
      - Type: Blue_Shape
        Color: blue (1)
        Properties: Unchanged from input.
      - Type: Gray_Shape/Pixel
        Color: gray (5)
        Properties: Subset of the original gray pixels; specifically those adjacent (cardinally or diagonally) to at least one blue pixel in the input.
      - Type: Red_Shape/Pixel
        Color: red (2)
        Properties: Occupy the positions of original gray pixels that were *not* adjacent (cardinally or diagonally) to any blue pixel in the input.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Action: Conditional color change.
  - Target: Pixels with color gray (5).
  - Condition: A gray pixel changes color if and only if none of its 8 neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) have the color blue (1).
  - Resulting_Color: If the condition is met, the gray (5) pixel becomes red (2). Otherwise, it remains gray (5).
  - Other_Pixels: All non-gray pixels remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid using its row and column index.
3.  If the current pixel's color is gray (5):
    a.  Examine the 8 neighboring pixels (adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) of the current gray pixel.
    b.  Check if any of these neighbors have the color blue (1). Handle boundary conditions (pixels outside the grid are not considered neighbors or are considered non-blue).
    c.  If *none* of the 8 neighbors are blue (1), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to red (2).
    d.  If *at least one* neighbor is blue (1), the corresponding pixel in the output grid remains gray (5) (no change needed since it was copied initially).
4.  If the current pixel's color is not gray (5), its value in the output grid remains unchanged from the input grid (no action needed).
5.  After checking all pixels, return the modified output grid.
