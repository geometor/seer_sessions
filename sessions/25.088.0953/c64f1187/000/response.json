A single pixel of a key color (e.g., red, green, yellow, azure) appears in one row, and directly below it in subsequent rows is a small shape constructed from blue pixels. Each key color corresponds to a unique blue shape pattern.\n    2.  **Instance Area (Bottom):** This area, towards the bottom, contains a grid-like structure built from gray frames (typically 2x2 gray pixels separated by white space). Inside some of these gray frames, single pixels matching the key colors from the Definition Area appear. These are instances of the keys.\n\n    The output grid is constructed by:\n    1.  Identifying the key-color-to-blue-shape mappings from the Definition Area.\n    2.  Locating each key color instance within the gray frame grid in the Instance Area.\n    3.  Determining the position of each instance within the frame grid (e.g., row 0, col 0; row 1, col 2, etc.).\n    4.  Mapping these frame grid positions to coordinates on the output grid using a scaling factor (multiplying frame row and column by 3).\n    5.  Drawing the shape associated with the key color (from step 1) at the corresponding mapped position in the output grid, using the key color itself instead of blue. The output grid's size is determined by the extent of the drawn shapes.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Scan the input grid, starting from the top row, to find isolated non-white, non-blue, non-gray pixels (\"key colors\").\n        b. For each key color found at position `(r_key, c_key)`, examine the rows directly below it (`r_key + 1`, `r_key + 2`, ...) to find connected components of blue(1) pixels (\"blue shapes\").\n        c. Determine the relative coordinates of the blue pixels comprising the shape with respect to a reference point (e.g., the top-leftmost blue pixel of the shape).\n        d. Store a mapping for each key color to its corresponding relative blue shape pattern.\n    2.  **Identify Instances and Frame Grid Positions:**\n        a. Scan the input grid, focusing on the area containing gray(5) pixels, to locate the grid structure formed by gray frames.\n        b. Identify the top-left corner coordinates of each potential or actual gray frame location. This defines a conceptual \"frame grid\".\n        c. Find all non-white, non-gray pixels located *inside* these gray frame areas (\"key instances\"). These pixels must match one of the key colors identified in step 1a.\n        d. For each key instance found, determine which gray frame it belongs to and record the frame's row (`fr`) and column (`fc`) index within the conceptual frame grid. Store the key color (`C`), frame row (`fr`), and frame column (`fc`) for each instance.\n    3.  **Determine Output Grid Size:**\n        a. Find the maximum `fr` (`max_fr`) and maximum `fc` (`max_fc`) among all identified instances.\n        b. For each instance (`C`, `fr`, `fc`), retrieve its associated shape pattern `S` (from step 1d).\n        c. Calculate the required dimensions for each shape when placed at `(fr*3, fc*3)`. The maximum row index needed will be `max(fr*3 + shape_height - 1)` over all instances, and the maximum column index needed will be `max(fc*3 + shape_width - 1)`.\n        d. The output grid height is `max_row_index + 1`, and the width is `max_col_index + 1`.\n    4.  **Construct the Output Grid:**\n        a. Create a new grid of the determined size, initialized with the background color white(0).\n        b. Iterate through each identified key instance (`C`, `fr`, `fc`).\n        c. Retrieve the relative shape pattern `S` associated with the key color `C`.\n        d. Calculate the top-left anchor position for drawing in the output grid: `output_row = fr * 3`, `output_col = fc * 3`.\n        e. For each relative coordinate `(dr, dc)` in the shape pattern `S`, color the pixel at `(output_row + dr, output_col + dc)` in the output grid with the key color `C`."
