            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain scattered horizontal and vertical line segments made of non-white pixels (colors 1-9) against a white background (color 0). These segments are typically one pixel thick.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids also have a white background but feature filled rectangular areas and lines corresponding to the input segments.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves projecting the colors from the input segments onto the grid.\n    *   **Horizontal Segments:** A horizontal segment of color C at row `r` spanning columns `c1` to `c2` seems to cause the columns `c1` through `c2` to be filled with color C from row 0 down to row `r`.\n    *   **Vertical Segments:** A vertical segment of color C at column `c` spanning rows `r1` to `r2` seems to cause the rows `r1` through `r2` to be filled with color C from column 0 across to column `c`.\n4.  **Overlap Handling:** When these projections overlap, or overlap with original non-white pixels:\n    *   The original non-white pixels from the input grid always appear in their original positions in the output grid, potentially overwriting any projections.\n    *   Where a downward projection (from a horizontal segment) and a leftward projection (from a vertical segment) overlap on a pixel that was originally white, the downward projection's color takes precedence.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Create an empty output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0).\n2.  **Perform Leftward Projections:** Iterate through each column `c` from left to right (0 to width-1) of the input grid. For each column, identify all contiguous vertical segments of non-white pixels. For a segment of color `C` spanning rows `r_start` to `r_end` at column `c`, fill the corresponding rows (`r` from `r_start` to `r_end`) in the output grid from column 0 up to and including column `c` (i.e., `output[r, 0:c+1]`) with color `C`.\n3.  **Perform Downward Projections:** Iterate through each row `r` from top to bottom (0 to height-1) of the input grid. For each row, identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels. For a segment of color `C` spanning columns `c_start` to `c_end` at row `r`, fill the corresponding columns (`c` from `c_start` to `c_end`) in the output grid from row 0 down to and including row `r` (i.e., `output[0:r+1, c]`) with color `C`. This step will overwrite any colors placed in step 2 where projections overlap.\n4.  **Restore Original Pixels:** Iterate through every cell (`r`, `c`) of the input grid. If the input cell `input[r, c]` contains a non-white color, set the corresponding output cell `output[r, c]` to that same color. This ensures the original segments are present and correctly colored in the final output, overwriting any projection colors at their specific locations.\n5.  The resulting grid is the final output."
