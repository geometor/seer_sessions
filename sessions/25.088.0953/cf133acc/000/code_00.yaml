Grid:
  Properties:
    - Size: variable height and width (up to 30x30)
    - Background: white (0)
Objects:
  - Type: Horizontal Segment
    Properties:
      - Color: C (non-zero)
      - Location: Row index r
      - Span: Column indices c_start to c_end
    Actions:
      - Project color C downwards: Fill output cells [0:r+1, c] with C for c in [c_start, c_end]
  - Type: Vertical Segment
    Properties:
      - Color: C (non-zero)
      - Location: Column index c
      - Span: Row indices r_start to r_end
    Actions:
      - Project color C leftwards: Fill output cells [r, 0:c+1] with C for r in [r_start, r_end]
Relationships & Rules:
  - Overlap Resolution:
    - Priority 1: Original non-white pixels from the input are preserved in the output.
    - Priority 2: Downward projections (from horizontal segments) overwrite leftward projections.
    - Priority 3: Leftward projections (from vertical segments) fill remaining white space.
    - Priority 4: Background remains white if not overwritten.
