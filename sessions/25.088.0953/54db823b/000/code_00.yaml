- description: Input and Output grids are processed.
- grid_properties:
    - shared_dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
    - background_color: White (0) serves as the background.
    - foreground_colors: Green (3) and Maroon (9) form objects.
- objects:
    - definition: Connected components of non-white pixels (Green or Maroon).
    - connectivity: Assumed to be 8-way (including diagonals).
    - properties:
        - maroon_count: The number of Maroon (9) pixels within the object.
        - size: The total number of pixels (Green or Maroon) within the object.
        - location: Defined by the set of pixel coordinates belonging to the object.
- transformation:
    - identification: All distinct non-white objects are identified.
    - calculation: The `maroon_count` is calculated for each object.
    - selection_criterion:
        - primary: Find the median value among all calculated `maroon_count`s. (Use lower median for even number of objects). Call this `target_maroon_count`.
        - secondary (tie-breaker): If multiple objects have `maroon_count` equal to `target_maroon_count`, select the object among them with the largest `size`.
        - tertiary (tie-breaker): If multiple objects match the `target_maroon_count` and have the same largest `size`, select the one whose top-most, then left-most pixel occurs first in grid scan order (row-major).
    - action: The single selected object is removed from the grid by changing all its pixels to the background color (White, 0).
- output: The modified grid after object removal.
