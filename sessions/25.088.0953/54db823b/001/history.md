Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example.
2.  **Colors Used:** The grids primarily use white (0) as the background, green (3) and maroon (9) for the foreground elements.
3.  **Object Identification:** The non-white pixels form distinct connected components or "objects". Connectivity seems to include diagonals (8-way connectivity).
4.  **Transformation:** In each example, the output grid is identical to the input grid, except that exactly one of the non-white objects has been removed (replaced with white pixels).
5.  **Identifying the Removed Object:** The core task is to figure out the criterion for selecting which object to remove.
    *   I examined properties like object size (total pixels), position, and the count of a specific color within the object.
    *   Counting the number of maroon (9) pixels within each object seems crucial.
    *   Let's list the maroon counts for objects in each example and identify the count of the removed object:
        *   `train_1`: Objects have maroon counts [4, 5, 6]. Removed object has count 5.
        *   `train_2`: Objects have maroon counts [3, 2, 2, 6]. Removed object has count 2.
        *   `train_3`: Objects have maroon counts [4, 3, 5, 4, 3, 4]. Removed object has count 4.
        *   `train_4`: Objects have maroon counts [6, 4, 5, 4]. Removed object has count 4.
    *   The rule appears related to the *median* maroon count.
        *   `train_1`: Median of [4, 5, 6] is 5. Remove the object with 5 maroon pixels. (Unique match)
        *   `train_2`: Median of [2, 2, 3, 6] is the lower of the two middle values, which is 2. Two objects have 2 maroon pixels. The removed one is larger (16 pixels vs 7 pixels).
        *   `train_3`: Median of [3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5] is 4. Three objects have 4 maroon pixels. The removed one is the largest (15 pixels vs 12 vs 11).
        *   `train_4`: Median of [4, 4, 5, 6] is 4. Two objects have 4 maroon pixels. The removed one is larger (30 pixels vs 15 pixels).
6.  **Conclusion:** The transformation identifies all connected non-white objects, calculates the number of maroon pixels in each, finds the median maroon count (using the lower median in case of an even number of objects), identifies all objects matching this median count, and if there's more than one, removes the one with the largest total pixel count.

**Facts**


```yaml
- description: Input and Output grids are processed.
- grid_properties:
    - shared_dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
    - background_color: White (0) serves as the background.
    - foreground_colors: Green (3) and Maroon (9) form objects.
- objects:
    - definition: Connected components of non-white pixels (Green or Maroon).
    - connectivity: Assumed to be 8-way (including diagonals).
    - properties:
        - maroon_count: The number of Maroon (9) pixels within the object.
        - size: The total number of pixels (Green or Maroon) within the object.
        - location: Defined by the set of pixel coordinates belonging to the object.
- transformation:
    - identification: All distinct non-white objects are identified.
    - calculation: The `maroon_count` is calculated for each object.
    - selection_criterion:
        - primary: Find the median value among all calculated `maroon_count`s. (Use lower median for even number of objects). Call this `target_maroon_count`.
        - secondary (tie-breaker): If multiple objects have `maroon_count` equal to `target_maroon_count`, select the object among them with the largest `size`.
        - tertiary (tie-breaker): If multiple objects match the `target_maroon_count` and have the same largest `size`, select the one whose top-most, then left-most pixel occurs first in grid scan order (row-major).
    - action: The single selected object is removed from the grid by changing all its pixels to the background color (White, 0).
- output: The modified grid after object removal.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all distinct connected components (objects) composed of non-white (Green - 3 or Maroon - 9) pixels in the input grid, using 8-way connectivity (including diagonals). If there are no non-white objects, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  For each identified object, calculate two properties:
    a.  `maroon_count`: The total number of maroon (9) pixels within that object.
    b.  `size`: The total number of pixels (green and maroon) within that object.
3.  Create a list of the `maroon_count` values from all objects.
4.  Determine the median value of this list. If the list has an even number of elements, use the lower of the two middle values as the median. Call this `target_maroon_count`.
5.  Identify all objects whose `maroon_count` is equal to `target_maroon_count`.
6.  If only one object matches the `target_maroon_count`, select this object for removal.
7.  If multiple objects match the `target_maroon_count`:
    a.  Compare the `size` of these matching objects.
    b.  Select the object with the largest `size`.
    c.  (If there is still a tie for the largest size, select the object among the tied ones whose top-most pixel has the smallest row index. If there's still a tie, use the smallest column index for that top-most row.)
8.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
9.  For the single object selected in step 6 or 7, change the color of all pixels belonging to that object in the output grid to white (0).
10. Return the modified output grid.
