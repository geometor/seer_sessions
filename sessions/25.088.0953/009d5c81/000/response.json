            "text": "**Perception of the Elements:**\n\nThe input grids contain two distinct non-background objects:\n1.  A larger pattern composed of 'azure' (8) pixels, located generally in the upper or central part of the grid. The shape and position of this pattern vary across examples.\n2.  A smaller pattern composed of 'blue' (1) pixels, located generally in the lower part of the grid. This blue pattern seems to take on specific simple shapes (like '+', 'T', 'L').\n\nThe output grids show the following transformations:\n1.  The azure (8) pattern from the input has changed color, while retaining its original shape and position. The new color varies between examples (red (2), green (3), orange (7)).\n2.  The blue (1) pattern from the input has disappeared, replaced by the background 'white' (0) color.\n3.  The background 'white' (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n\nThe key observation is that the *shape* of the blue (1) pattern in the input determines the *color* that the azure (8) pattern transforms into in the output.\n\n*   A blue '+' shape corresponds to the azure pixels becoming 'red' (2). (Examples 1, 3)\n*   A blue rotated 'T' shape (looks like \u3157) corresponds to the azure pixels becoming 'green' (3). (Examples 2, 5)\n*   A blue 'L' shape corresponds to the azure pixels becoming 'orange' (7). (Example 4)\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
