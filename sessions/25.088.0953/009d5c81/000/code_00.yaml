task_description: Processes an input grid containing an azure pattern and a blue shape pattern, transforming the azure pattern's color based on the blue shape.

elements:
  - object: azure_pattern
    description: A configuration of azure (8) pixels. Its shape and position vary.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - role: target_object_for_color_change
  - object: blue_pattern
    description: A small configuration of blue (1) pixels, forming a distinct shape (e.g., '+', 'T', 'L').
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - role: instruction_key_for_color_change
      - shape_determines_output_color: true
  - object: background
    description: The white (0) pixels forming the grid background.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - role: static_background

transformations:
  - action: identify_blue_shape
    input: blue_pattern
    output: shape_category ('+', 'T', 'L', etc.)
    description: Determine the geometric shape formed by the contiguous blue (1) pixels.
  - action: map_shape_to_color
    input: shape_category (from identify_blue_shape)
    output: target_color (red (2), green (3), orange (7), etc.)
    description: >
      Establish a mapping rule:
      '+' shape maps to red (2).
      'T' shape (rotated 90 deg clockwise) maps to green (3).
      'L' shape maps to orange (7).
  - action: recolor_azure_pattern
    input: azure_pattern, target_color (from map_shape_to_color)
    output: modified_azure_pattern
    description: Replace all azure (8) pixels with the determined target_color. The shape and position remain the same.
  - action: remove_blue_pattern
    input: blue_pattern
    output: modified_grid_area
    description: Replace all blue (1) pixels with the background color (white (0)).

output_grid_composition:
  - The modified_azure_pattern (recolored).
  - The background pixels.
  - The areas previously occupied by the blue_pattern, now filled with background color.
