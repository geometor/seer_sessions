*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input grids contain a white background (0) and typically two distinct objects composed of non-white pixels (primarily red (2) and sometimes gray (5)).
    *   The objects are located in different regions of the grid.
    *   The output grids preserve the original non-white objects in their exact positions.
    *   The key transformation is the addition of yellow (4) pixels. These yellow pixels fill a rectangular area.
    *   This rectangular area appears to be defined by the overall extent of the initial non-white objects. Specifically, it's the bounding box encompassing all non-white pixels from the input grid.
    *   Crucially, the yellow fill only replaces pixels that were originally white (0) within this bounding box. Original non-white pixels within the bounding box remain unchanged. Pixels outside the bounding box also remain unchanged (staying white).

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - item: grid
        description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9.
      - item: background_pixels
        color: white (0)
        role: Fills most of the grid initially. Can be replaced by the fill color.
      - item: object_pixels
        color: Any non-white color (observed: red(2), gray(5))
        role: Define the key structures and determine the fill area. Persist from input to output.
        grouping: Often appear as two distinct spatial groups in the input.
      - item: fill_color
        color: yellow (4)
        role: Used to fill a specific region in the output grid.
    transformation:
      - step: 1 Identify non-white pixels
        input: input_grid
        output: set of coordinates (r, c) for all pixels where color != 0
      - step: 2 Determine bounding box
        input: set of non-white pixel coordinates
        output: bounding_box defined by (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) enclosing all identified coordinates.
      - step: 3 Initialize output grid
        operation: Copy input grid to output grid.
      - step: 4 Apply fill
        target_area: All pixels (r, c) within the calculated bounding_box.
        condition: Check if the pixel at (r, c) in the *input* grid is white (0).
        action: If the condition is true, set the pixel at (r, c) in the *output* grid to yellow (4). Otherwise, leave the pixel as it was copied in step 3.
    relationships:
      - The location and extent of the initial non-white pixels determine the boundaries of the area to be filled with yellow.
      - The fill operation (changing pixels to yellow) is conditional on the original color of the pixel being white and its location being within the overall bounding box of non-white pixels.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0).
    2.  Calculate the minimum bounding box that contains all these identified non-white pixels. This box is defined by the minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, and maximum column occupied by any non-white pixel.
    3.  Create a new grid for the output, initially identical to the input grid.
    4.  Iterate through each pixel location (row, column) within the calculated bounding box (inclusive of the boundary rows and columns).
    5.  For each pixel location inside the bounding box, check the color of the corresponding pixel in the *original input* grid.
    6.  If the original input pixel at that location is white (0), change the color of the pixel at the same location in the *output* grid to yellow (4).
    7.  If the original input pixel was not white, leave the pixel in the output grid unchanged (it retains its original non-white color).
    8.  Pixels outside the bounding box remain unchanged from the input to the output.
