These yellow pixels fill a rectangular area.\n    *   This rectangular area appears to be defined by the overall extent of the initial non-white objects. Specifically, it's the bounding box encompassing all non-white pixels from the input grid.\n    *   Crucially, the yellow fill only replaces pixels that were originally white (0) within this bounding box. Original non-white pixels within the bounding box remain unchanged. Pixels outside the bounding box also remain unchanged (staying white).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
