"""
Transforms the input grid by applying a row-dependent horizontal shift to the pixels of the single non-white object. The specific sequence of shifts applied over a 4-row cycle depends on the color of the object.

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels (the object) in the input grid. Determine its color (`object_color`). If no object exists, return the empty output grid.
3.  Find the row index of the topmost pixel of the object (`object_top_row`).
4.  Define a mapping from the object's color to a specific 4-element sequence of horizontal shifts:
    *   Red (2) or Green (3): `[0, -1, 0, 1]` (No shift, Left, No shift, Right)
    *   Gray (5): `[-1, 0, 1, 0]` (Left, No shift, Right, No shift)
    *   Azure (8): `[1, 0, -1, 0]` (Right, No shift, Left, No shift)
    *   Default/Other: `[0, 0, 0, 0]` (No shift)
5.  Iterate through each non-white pixel `p` of the object, located at input coordinates `(row, col)`.
6.  For each pixel `p`:
    a.  Calculate its row index relative to the object's top: `relative_row = row - object_top_row`.
    b.  Determine the index within the shift sequence using the modulo operator: `shift_index = relative_row % 4`.
    c.  Retrieve the corresponding horizontal shift amount from the sequence selected based on `object_color`.
    d.  Calculate the new column coordinate for the pixel: `new_col = col + shift_amount`.
    e.  Check if `new_col` is a valid column index within the grid's width.
    f.  If `new_col` is valid, place the pixel's original color (`object_color`) at coordinates `(row, new_col)` in the output grid.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
