task_description: Apply a horizontal shift to each row of the single non-white object. The specific shift sequence depends on the object's color.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - dimensions_preserved: true

object_properties:
  - type: single contiguous block of non-white pixels
  - color_preservation: color of the object remains unchanged
  - shape_preservation: shape is distorted horizontally by row shifts, but vertical structure is maintained.

transformation:
  - name: row_wise_horizontal_shift
  - steps:
      1: Identify the single non-white object and its color (`object_color`).
      2: Determine the row index of the topmost pixel of the object (`object_top_row`).
      3: Select the appropriate 4-element shift pattern based on `object_color`:
          - Red (2) or Green (3): `[0, -1, 0, 1]` (No shift, Left, No shift, Right)
          - Gray (5): `[-1, 0, 1, 0]` (Left, No shift, Right, No shift)
          - Azure (8): `[1, 0, -1, 0]` (Right, No shift, Left, No shift)
      4: Create an empty output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
      5: For each non-white pixel `p` at input coordinates `(r, c)`:
          a: Calculate its relative row index: `relative_row = r - object_top_row`.
          b: Determine the index into the shift pattern: `shift_index = relative_row % 4`.
          c: Get the horizontal shift amount from the selected pattern: `shift_amount = pattern[shift_index]`.
          d: Calculate the target column: `new_c = c + shift_amount`.
          e: If `new_c` is within the grid's width boundaries:
             - Set the pixel at `(r, new_c)` in the output grid to the `object_color`.
      6: Return the output grid.
