            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core transformation mechanism: applying a horizontal shift to each row of the single non-white object based on its relative row index (`relative_row`) within the object. The code implemented a specific repeating shift pattern `[0, -1, 0, 1]` based on `relative_row % 4`, which successfully solved Examples 1 and 2.\n\nHowever, this fixed pattern failed for Examples 3 and 4, indicating that the specific sequence of shifts is not constant but varies between examples. Analysis reveals that the shift pattern is determined by the *color* of the object. The previous code needs to be updated to select the correct shift pattern based on the object's color before applying the shifts row by row.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's analyze the shift patterns for each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Object Color: Green (3)\n    *   Object Top Row: 4\n    *   Observed Shifts (relative\\_row % 4 = 0, 1, 2, 3): `[0, -1, 0, +1]`\n    *   Code Result: Match\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Object Color: Red (2)\n    *   Object Top Row: 3\n    *   Observed Shifts (relative\\_row % 4 = 0, 1, 2, 3): `[0, -1, 0, +1]`\n    *   Code Result: Match\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Object Color: Gray (5)\n    *   Object Top Row: 2\n    *   Observed Shifts (relative\\_row % 4 = 0, 1, 2, 3): `[-1, 0, +1, 0]`\n    *   Code Result: Mismatch (Applied `[0, -1, 0, +1]`)\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Object Color: Azure (8)\n    *   Object Top Row: 2\n    *   Observed Shifts (relative\\_row % 4 = 0, 1, 2, 3): `[+1, 0, -1, 0]`\n    *   Code Result: Mismatch (Applied `[0, -1, 0, +1]`)\n\n**Summary of Color-Dependent Shift Patterns:**\n\n*   Red (2): `[0, -1, 0, 1]`\n*   Green (3): `[0, -1, 0, 1]`\n*   Gray (5): `[-1, 0, 1, 0]`\n*   Azure (8): `[1, 0, -1, 0]`\n\nThe core logic remains the same: identify the object, find its top row, and iterate through its pixels. The key change is that the shift amount for a pixel at `(r, c)` depends not only on `(r - object_top_row) % 4` but also on the object's color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
