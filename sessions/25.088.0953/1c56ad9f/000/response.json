            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n2.  **Background:** The background is consistently white (color 0).\n3.  **Foreground Object:** Each input grid contains a single, contiguous object composed of a single non-white color (green, red, gray, or azure). These objects have complex, often grid-like or patterned internal structures with white spaces.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves modifying the horizontal position of the pixels within the foreground object. The object's color and overall vertical extent remain the same.\n5.  **Row-Dependent Shift:** Observing the changes row by row reveals a pattern. Pixels in certain rows of the object shift left, some shift right, and some remain in the same horizontal position.\n6.  **Shift Pattern:** Comparing the input and output objects across all examples, the horizontal shift applied to the pixels of a given row depends on the row's index relative to the topmost row of the object. The pattern of shifts repeats every four rows:\n    *   Row 0 (relative to object top): No shift (shift = 0)\n    *   Row 1 (relative to object top): Shift left by 1 (shift = -1)\n    *   Row 2 (relative to object top): No shift (shift = 0)\n    *   Row 3 (relative to object top): Shift right by 1 (shift = +1)\n    *   This pattern `[0, -1, 0, +1]` continues cyclically for subsequent rows of the object (e.g., relative row 4 behaves like relative row 0, relative row 5 like relative row 1, etc.).\n7.  **Pixel Mapping:** Each non-white pixel in the input grid at `(row, col)` is mapped to a new position `(row, col + shift_amount)` in the output grid, where `shift_amount` is determined by the row's relative index within the object as described above. Pixels shifted outside the grid boundaries are discarded. Pixels originally white remain white unless a non-white pixel is shifted into their position.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Create a new grid (the \"output grid\") with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n2.
