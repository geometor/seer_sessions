"""
Identifies yellow pixels (4) in the input grid.
For each yellow pixel, identifies its adjacent white (0) neighbors.
Performs a region-finding flood fill (BFS) starting from these adjacent white neighbors.
The fill explores only adjacent (cardinal directions) white (0) pixels.
All white pixels discovered during these BFS traversals are collected.
Finally, these collected white pixels are colored red (2) in the output grid.
Gray pixels (5), the original yellow pixels (4), and any other non-white pixels act as boundaries and remain unchanged.
White pixels not reachable from any yellow pixel's adjacent white neighbors also remain unchanged.
