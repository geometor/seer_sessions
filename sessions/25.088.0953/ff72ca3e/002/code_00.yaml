Initial_Grid_Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    color: White (0)
    role: Fillable background area
  - type: Pixel
    color: Yellow (4)
    role: Seed/Origin point for a fill operation
  - type: Pixel
    color: Gray (5)
    role: Impassable barrier/boundary for fill operation

Derived_Grid_Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    color: Red (2)
    role: Result of filling a White pixel area

Properties:
  - Adjacency: Cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are relevant for fill propagation.
  - Connectivity: Contiguous regions of White pixels connected cardinally.
  - Bounding: Gray pixels (and potentially other non-White pixels) prevent fill propagation.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all Yellow pixels in the input grid.
  - Define_Region: For each Yellow pixel, determine the connected region of White pixels that are reachable from the Yellow pixel's adjacent White neighbors by moving only through White pixels, without crossing Gray pixels or other non-White pixels.
  - Color_Region: Change the color of all White pixels within the identified region to Red (2).
  - Preserve: Keep Yellow pixels Yellow, Gray pixels Gray, and any other original non-White pixels unchanged. White pixels outside any defined region remain White.

Constraint:
  - Fill_Propagation: The fill spreads exclusively through connected White (0) pixels.
  - Fill_Boundary: The fill stops at any non-White pixel (Gray, Yellow, others) and grid edges.
  - Fill_Origin: The fill process conceptually starts from a Yellow pixel, effectively filling the connected component of White pixels adjacent to it.
