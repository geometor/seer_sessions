```python
"""
Identifies yellow pixels (color 4) in the input grid. 
For each yellow pixel, it finds its immediately adjacent (cardinally) white pixels (color 0).
These adjacent white pixels serve as starting points for a Breadth-First Search (BFS).
The BFS explores all contiguous white pixels reachable from these starting points.
The exploration is constrained by the grid boundaries and any non-white pixels (colors 1-9).
All unique white pixels discovered through this BFS process (originating from any yellow pixel's neighborhood) are collected.
Finally, these collected white pixels are colored red (color 2) in the output grid, while all other pixels retain their original colors.
