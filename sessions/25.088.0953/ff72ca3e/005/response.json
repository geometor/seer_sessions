For each yellow pixel, it finds \nall contiguous white pixels (0) reachable starting from the white pixels \nimmediately adjacent (cardinally) to the yellow pixel. The exploration (flood fill using BFS) \nis constrained by grid boundaries and any non-white pixels (e.g., gray (5), \nthe source yellow (4) pixel itself, or any other color). All unique white pixels \nreached through these explorations across all starting yellow pixels are \ncollected. Finally, these collected white pixels are colored red (2) in the \noutput grid, while all other pixels retain their original colors.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by flood-filling white regions adjacent to yellow \n    pixels with red, respecting non-white boundaries.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to numpy array for efficient operations\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid_np = np.copy(input_grid_np)\n    height, width = input_grid_np.shape\n\n    # Find coordinates of all yellow pixels (color 4)\n    yellow_pixels = np.argwhere(input_grid_np == 4)\n\n    # Define cardinal neighbors offsets (up, down, left, right)\n    neighbors = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n\n    # Set to store the coordinates of all white pixels that should be colored red globally\n    white_pixels_to_color_red = set()\n\n    # Iterate through each found yellow pixel to initiate a potential fill\n    for yr, yc in yellow_pixels:\n        # Initialize the BFS queue for the current yellow pixel's adjacent white region\n        q = deque()\n        # Initialize a set to track visited white pixels for *this specific* fill instance\n        # This prevents cycles and redundant exploration within this fill.\n        visited_locally = set()\n\n        # Check initial white neighbors of the current yellow pixel\n        for dr, dc in neighbors:\n            nr, nc = yr + dr, yc + dc\n            # Check if neighbor is within bounds and is white (0)\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and input_grid_np[nr, nc] == 0:\n                # If this white neighbor hasn't been visited in this local fill yet\n                if (nr, nc) not in visited_locally:\n                    visited_locally.add((nr, nc))\n                    q.append((nr, nc))\n                    # Add to the global set of pixels to be colored red\n                    white_pixels_to_color_red.add((nr, nc))\n\n        # Perform BFS starting from the adjacent white pixels found\n        while q:\n            r, c = q.popleft()\n\n            # Explore cardinal neighbors of the current white pixel\n            for dr, dc in neighbors:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n                # Check if neighbor is within grid bounds\n                if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                    # Check if the neighbor is white (color 0) AND\n                    # has not been visited yet in *this specific* BFS run\n                    if input_grid_np[nr, nc] == 0 and (nr, nc) not in visited_locally:\n                        # Mark neighbor as visited for this local fill\n                        visited_locally.add((nr, nc))\n                        # Add neighbor to the global set of pixels to be colored red\n                        white_pixels_to_color_red.add((nr, nc))\n                        # Add neighbor to the queue for further exploration\n                        q.append((nr, nc))\n\n    # After processing all yellow pixels and their corresponding fills,\n    # color the collected white pixels in the output grid.\n    for r, c in white_pixels_to_color_red:\n        output_grid_np[r, c] = 2 # Change color to red (2)\n\n    # Convert the final numpy array back to a list of lists\n    return output_grid_np.tolist()\n```"
