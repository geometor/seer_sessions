Task: Color contiguous white regions adjacent to yellow pixels red, respecting boundaries.

Input_Grid:
  - Objects:
      - Background: Pixels with color white (0).
      - Markers: Pixels with color yellow (4).
      - Barriers: Pixels with color gray (5). Can also be other non-white pixels.
      - Other_Colors: Pixels with other colors (not present in these examples but possible) act as barriers.
  - Properties:
      - White pixels form contiguous regions.
      - Yellow pixels mark regions of interest.
      - Gray pixels (and other non-white pixels) define boundaries for white regions.
      - Grid dimensions vary.

Output_Grid:
  - Objects: Same as input, but some white pixels are changed.
      - Filled_Region: Pixels with color red (2).
  - Properties:
      - Red pixels replace white pixels.
      - Red pixels form contiguous regions.
      - Each red region originates from the white area immediately adjacent (cardinal neighbors) to at least one yellow pixel.
      - The extent of a red region is limited by the boundaries (gray, yellow, other non-white pixels, grid edges) encountered when exploring outwards from the initial adjacent white pixels.
      - White pixels not reachable from a yellow pixel via a path of only white pixels remain white.
      - Yellow, gray, and other original non-white pixels remain unchanged.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all yellow (4) pixels.
  - Initiate_Fill: For each yellow pixel, find its adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (0) neighbors. These are the starting points for the fill associated with that yellow pixel.
  - Propagate_Fill (Flood Fill/BFS):
      - Start from the initial adjacent white neighbors identified above.
      - Explore adjacent (cardinal) white pixels.
      - Constraint: Stop exploration at any pixel that is not white (0) or is outside the grid boundaries. Barriers include gray (5), the original yellow (4) pixels themselves, and any other color.
  - Collect: Gather the coordinates of all white pixels visited by any of the flood fills initiated.
  - Transform: Create the output grid by copying the input grid. Change the color of all collected white pixels to red (2).
