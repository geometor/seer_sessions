## General Assessment

The provided Python code attempts to implement a flood fill originating from white pixels adjacent to yellow pixels. However, the results clearly show that the implementation is flawed. In all examples, the flood fill incorrectly colors almost all white pixels red, ignoring the boundaries (gray pixels) present in the input and expected output grids.

The core issue appears to be in the management of the visited set (`globally_visited_white`) and potentially the boundary conditions within the Breadth-First Search (BFS). The current logic allows the fill to "leak" across the entire grid, possibly because visited white cells are marked globally, allowing subsequent fills (or even the same fill) to expand beyond the intended local region defined by boundaries.

The strategy for resolution involves refining the flood fill logic:
1.  Ensure that the BFS for each yellow pixel explores only contiguous white pixels.
2.  Crucially, the BFS must stop expansion when it encounters *any* non-white pixel (gray, yellow, others) or the grid edge. These non-white pixels act as barriers.
3.  The management of visited cells needs careful reconsideration. Perhaps each yellow pixel's fill should have its own local visited set, or the global set logic needs correction to prevent unwanted merging or boundary crossing. The fill should only start from the immediate white neighbours and expand outwards within the connected white region until boundaries are hit.

## Metrics Analysis

Let's analyze the examples to quantify the intended behavior versus the flawed output.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Yellow Pixels:** The number and locations are correctly identified.
*   **Gray Pixels:** These exist in all inputs and clearly act as boundaries in the expected outputs.
*   **Red Pixel Counts:** The `num_transformed_red_pixels` consistently matches the `num_initial_white_pixels` in the first three examples, confirming that *all* originally white pixels were incorrectly colored red. In Example 4, 97 out of 97 initial white pixels were turned red, while the expected number was 48.
*   **Extra Red Pixels:** The `num_extra_red_pixels` count is high in all cases, matching the difference between `num_transformed_red_pixels` and `num_expected_red_pixels` (except for a slight discrepancy in Example 4 due to one missed red pixel). This confirms the over-filling.
*   **Missed Red Pixels:** Example 4 shows 1 missed red pixel (`[2, 1]` was expected red but remained white in the transform output). This indicates another potential minor flaw, though the primary issue is the over-filling. Investigating the specific location `[2, 1]` in Example 4 might reveal an edge case or boundary interaction missed. *Correction*: The metrics code `num_missed_red_pixels` calculation seems flawed compared to the direct `pixels_off`. Re-running just that calculation might be needed. Let's re-check the pixel counts manually for Example 4. Initial white: 97. Expected red: 48. Transformed red: 97. Expected white remaining: 97 - 48 = 49. Transformed white remaining: 0. Pixels off = (pixels expected red but are white) + (pixels expected white but are red) = 0 + 49 = 49. The initial report said 51 pixels off, let's re-run the `pixels_off` calculation.

``` python

```
```
pixels_off_4=49
initial_white_4=97
expected_red_4=48
transformed_red_4=97
missed_red_4=0
extra_red_4=49

```
**Revised Metrics Analysis (Example 4):** The re-calculation confirms `pixels_off` is 49, `missed_red` is 0, and `extra_red` is 49. This aligns with the observation that all 97 initial white pixels were turned red, while only 48 should have been. The previous metric calculation had an error.

*   **Red Outside White:** The count is 0 for all examples, confirming the code correctly only attempts to color pixels that were originally white.

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The code fails by coloring *all* reachable white pixels across the grid, starting from any white neighbor of *any* yellow pixel, instead of containing the fill within the local region bounded by non-white pixels for *each* yellow pixel independently.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Color contiguous white regions adjacent to yellow pixels red, respecting boundaries.

Input_Grid:
  - Objects:
      - Background: Pixels with color white (0).
      - Markers: Pixels with color yellow (4).
      - Barriers: Pixels with color gray (5). Can also be other non-white pixels.
      - Other_Colors: Pixels with other colors (not present in these examples but possible) act as barriers.
  - Properties:
      - White pixels form contiguous regions.
      - Yellow pixels mark regions of interest.
      - Gray pixels (and other non-white pixels) define boundaries for white regions.
      - Grid dimensions vary.

Output_Grid:
  - Objects: Same as input, but some white pixels are changed.
      - Filled_Region: Pixels with color red (2).
  - Properties:
      - Red pixels replace white pixels.
      - Red pixels form contiguous regions.
      - Each red region originates from the white area immediately adjacent (cardinal neighbors) to at least one yellow pixel.
      - The extent of a red region is limited by the boundaries (gray, yellow, other non-white pixels, grid edges) encountered when exploring outwards from the initial adjacent white pixels.
      - White pixels not reachable from a yellow pixel via a path of only white pixels remain white.
      - Yellow, gray, and other original non-white pixels remain unchanged.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all yellow (4) pixels.
  - Initiate_Fill: For each yellow pixel, find its adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (0) neighbors. These are the starting points for the fill associated with that yellow pixel.
  - Propagate_Fill (Flood Fill/BFS):
      - Start from the initial adjacent white neighbors identified above.
      - Explore adjacent (cardinal) white pixels.
      - Constraint: Stop exploration at any pixel that is not white (0) or is outside the grid boundaries. Barriers include gray (5), the original yellow (4) pixels themselves, and any other color.
  - Collect: Gather the coordinates of all white pixels visited by any of the flood fills initiated.
  - Transform: Create the output grid by copying the input grid. Change the color of all collected white pixels to red (2).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Create an empty set, `white_pixels_to_color_red`, to store the coordinates of white pixels that need to be changed to red.
3.  Find the coordinates of all yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
4.  For each yellow pixel found at coordinates `(y_row, y_col)`:
    a.  Initialize a queue for Breadth-First Search (BFS), specific to this yellow pixel's region.
    b.  Initialize a set, `visited_for_this_fill`, to track white pixels visited during the fill originating from *this* yellow pixel, preventing cycles and redundant processing within this specific fill.
    c.  Check the four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) of the current yellow pixel.
    d.  For each neighbor `(n_row, n_col)`:
        i.  If the neighbor is within the grid bounds AND is white (0) AND has not already been added to the global `white_pixels_to_color_red` set (to avoid adding starting points multiple times if they are neighbours to multiple yellows, though the fill itself will handle shared regions):
            1.  Add the neighbor's coordinates `(n_row, n_col)` to the BFS queue.
            2.  Add the neighbor's coordinates `(n_row, n_col)` to `visited_for_this_fill`.
            3.  Add the neighbor's coordinates `(n_row, n_col)` to `white_pixels_to_color_red`.
    e.  While the BFS queue is not empty:
        i.  Dequeue a white pixel coordinate `(curr_row, curr_col)`.
        ii. Check the four cardinal neighbors `(next_row, next_col)` of the current pixel `(curr_row, curr_col)`.
        iii. For each neighbor:
            1.  If the neighbor is within grid bounds AND is white (0) AND has not been visited in *this specific fill* (i.e., not in `visited_for_this_fill`):
                a.  Add the neighbor's coordinates `(next_row, next_col)` to `visited_for_this_fill`.
                b.  Add the neighbor's coordinates `(next_row, next_col)` to `white_pixels_to_color_red`.
                c.  Enqueue the neighbor's coordinates `(next_row, next_col)`.
5.  After iterating through all yellow pixels and performing their respective BFS fills, iterate through all coordinates stored in the `white_pixels_to_color_red` set.
6.  For each coordinate `(r, c)` in the set, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to red (2).
7.  Return the final output grid.
