"""
Apply a vertical shear transformation to the single non-white object in the grid. 
The transformation shifts pixels horizontally to the left. 
The amount of shift for a pixel depends on its row position relative to the 
bottom-most row of the object. Pixels in the bottom-most row do not shift. 
Pixels in the row above the bottom shift left by 1 column, the row above that 
shifts left by 2 columns, and so on. The vertical position (row) of each 
pixel remains unchanged. Pixels shifted off the left edge of the grid are removed.
