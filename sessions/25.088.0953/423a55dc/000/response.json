The grids contain pixels represented by integers 0-9, corresponding to colors. White (0) appears to be the background color in all examples.\n2.  **Objects:** In each input grid, there is a single contiguous object composed of non-white pixels. The shape and color of this object vary across examples (azure rectangle, magenta rectangle, green 'G', red 'R', azure rectangle).\n3.  **Transformation:** The object from the input grid appears transformed in the output grid. The background remains white. The transformation seems to be a geometric shear or slant applied to the object.\n4.  **Shear Pattern:** Observing the relationship between input and output objects, the transformation consistently shifts pixels horizontally to the left. The amount of shift applied to a pixel depends on its row position relative to the bottom of the object. Pixels in the bottom-most row of the object do not shift horizontally. Pixels in the row above the bottom shift left by 1 column. Pixels two rows above the bottom shift left by 2 columns, and so on. The vertical position (row) of each pixel remains unchanged.\n5.  **Bounding Box:** The transformation is relative to the object itself, specifically its lowest row. The absolute position within the grid changes, but the logic depends on the object's structure.\n6.  **Output Grid Construction:** The output grid is initially white. The transformed object pixels are then placed onto this grid. Pixels shifted outside the left boundary (column index < 0) are effectively removed.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Calculate the target column for this pixel in the output grid by subtracting the calculated `shift` from the original `column`.\n7.  If the calculated target column is within the valid column range of the grid (i.e., not less than 0), place the object's color at the location `(row, target_column)` in the output grid.\n8.
