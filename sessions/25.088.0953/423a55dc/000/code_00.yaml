task_description: Apply a vertical shear transformation to the single non-white object in the grid.
grid_properties:
  background_color: 0 # white
  dimensions: Variable (input and output have the same dimensions for each example)
objects:
  - role: primary
    count: 1 per grid
    attributes:
      color: Any non-zero integer (1-9)
      shape: Variable (rectangle, letter-like shapes observed)
      contiguity: Pixels of the same non-zero color form a single connected component.
relationships:
  - type: positional
    elements: [object pixel, object bounding box]
    details: The transformation of a pixel depends on its row relative to the bottom row of the object's bounding box.
actions:
  - name: find_object
    input: input_grid
    output: object_pixels_coordinates, object_color
  - name: find_bounding_box
    input: object_pixels_coordinates
    output: min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col
  - name: calculate_shear_shift
    inputs: [pixel_row, max_row]
    output: horizontal_shift
    formula: shift = max_row - pixel_row
  - name: apply_transformation
    inputs: [input_grid, object_pixels_coordinates, object_color, horizontal_shift_map]
    output: output_grid
    process: Create an empty output grid (same size, background color). For each object pixel at (r, c) in the input, calculate its shift = max_row - r. Calculate the new column new_c = c - shift. If 0 <= new_c < grid_width, place the object_color at (r, new_c) in the output grid.
