- task_type: object_manipulation
- grid_properties:
    - background_color: 0 (white)
    - dimensions_vary: False # All examples are 15x15, but test case might differ
    - content: multiple distinct objects on a background
- object_properties:
    - definition: contiguous groups of non-white pixels (using 4-way adjacency)
    - colors: can be composed of multiple colors
    - shape: varied, often geometric patterns (like 3x3 squares or L-shapes)
    - count: varies per example (4, 5, 5 in training)
- transformation: spatial_translation
- action_details:
    - identification: identify each distinct non-white object
    - reference_point: the rightmost column (`max_col`) occupied by any pixel *within that specific object*
    - target_point: the rightmost column of the grid (`grid_width - 1`)
    - movement: horizontal shift (translation) only
    - shift_calculation: `shift = (grid_width - 1) - object_max_col` for each object
    - application: apply the calculated `shift` to all pixels belonging to that object
    - constraint: relative positions of pixels within an object are preserved
    - constraint: vertical positions of objects are preserved
    - constraint: objects are processed independently
- edge_cases:
    - empty_grid: if input has no non-white pixels, output is identical to input (implied by object identification step)
