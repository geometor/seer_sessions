Identify all distinct non-background objects (connected groups of non-white pixels using 4-way adjacency). Record the pixels, min column, and max column for each object.\n2. Group these objects based on column overlap. Two objects belong to the same group if their horizontal extents (from min column to max column) overlap. This grouping is transitive (if A overlaps B, and B overlaps C, then A, B, C are in the same group).\n3. For each group of objects:\n    a. Determine the overall maximum column index (`group_max_c`) occupied by any pixel belonging to any object within that group.\n    b. Calculate the required horizontal shift for the entire group: `shift = (grid_width - 1) - group_max_c`, where `grid_width` is the width of the input grid.\n4. Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).\n5. Apply the calculated shift to all pixels of all objects within each group. For each pixel `(row, col)` with `color` belonging to an object in a group, place the `color` at the new coordinates `(row, col + shift)` in the output grid.\n6. If no objects are found, return the input grid unchanged.\n7. Return the completed output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nclass DSU:\n    \"\"\"Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find) data structure.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        # Initialize parent array: each element is its own parent initially.\n        self.parent = list(range(n))\n        # Keep track of additional data associated with each set (e.g., max column).\n        self.data = {}\n\n    def find(self, i):\n        # Find the representative (root) of the set containing element i with path compression.\n        if self.parent[i] == i:\n            return i\n        self.parent[i] = self.find(self.parent[i]) # Path compression\n        return self.parent[i]\n\n    def union(self, i, j, merge_data_func):\n        # Merge the sets containing elements i and j.\n        root_i = self.find(i)\n        root_j = self.find(j)\n        if root_i != root_j:\n            # Merge the sets by making one root the parent of the other.\n            # Here, we make root_j the parent of root_i.\n            self.parent[root_i] = root_j\n            # Merge associated data using the provided function.\n            # The merged data is stored with the new root (root_j).\n            self.data[root_j] = merge_data_func(self.data.get(root_j), self.data.get(root_i))\n            # Remove data associated with the old root (root_i) if it exists.\n            if root_i in self.data:\n                del self.data[root_i]\n            return True # Indicates a successful merge\n        return False # Indicates i and j were already in the same set\n\ndef find_objects(grid_np):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all distinct connected components (objects) of non-background pixels\n    using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and determines their column bounds.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_np: A NumPy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of objects.
