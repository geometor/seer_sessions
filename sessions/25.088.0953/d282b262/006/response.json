            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying all distinct non-background objects and shifting each one horizontally so its individual rightmost edge aligns with the grid's right edge. The results indicate this approach is incorrect. The transformed outputs consistently differ from the expected outputs, suggesting the shifting logic needs revision.\n\nComparing the expected and transformed outputs reveals that objects are indeed shifted rightwards, but not always to the absolute right edge of the grid. Instead, objects seem to be grouped, and each group shifts together based on the rightmost point *within that group*. The key is to correctly identify these groups and determine the appropriate collective shift for each.\n\nThe likely grouping criterion appears to be based on **vertical alignment or column overlap**. Objects whose horizontal extents (column ranges) overlap seem to belong to the same group. The entire group then shifts so that the rightmost pixel among *all* objects in the group aligns with the grid's right edge.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects**: Use a connected components algorithm (like BFS or DFS) to find all distinct non-background objects (4-way adjacency). For each object, determine its pixels and its bounding box (min/max row and column).\n2.  **Group Objects**: Group the identified objects based on column overlap. Two objects belong to the same group if their column ranges [min_col, max_col] overlap. This grouping should be transitive (if A overlaps with B, and B overlaps with C, then A, B, and C are in the same group).\n3.  **Calculate Group Shift**: For each group, find the overall maximum column index (`group_max_c`) occupied by any pixel belonging to any object within that group. Calculate the required horizontal shift for the entire group: `shift = (grid_width - 1) - group_max_c`.\n4.  **Apply Shift**: Apply this calculated `shift` to *all* pixels of *all* objects within the group. Place the shifted pixels onto a new output grid initialized with the background color.\n5.  **Final Output**: Return the completed output grid.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's analyze the examples using the proposed grouping and shifting logic.\n"
