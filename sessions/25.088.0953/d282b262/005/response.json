Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n2. Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is defined as a contiguous group of non-white pixels (connected horizontally or vertically, 4-way adjacency).\n3. If no objects are found (the grid is entirely white or empty), return the input grid unchanged.\n4. For each identified object:\n    a. Determine the maximum column index (`object_max_col`) occupied by any pixel belonging to this object.\n    b. Calculate the required horizontal shift for this object: `shift = (grid_width - 1) - object_max_col`, where `grid_width` is the width of the input grid.\n    c. Iterate through all pixels `(row, col)` with `color` belonging to this object.\n    d. Calculate the new column for each pixel: `new_col = col + shift`.\n    e. Place the `color` of the pixel at the new coordinates `(row, new_col)` in the output grid. Ensure the new column is within grid bounds (though the shift calculation should guarantee this if `object_max_col` is correct).\n5. Return the completed output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid_np):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all distinct connected components (objects) of non-background pixels\n    using Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n\n    Args:\n        grid_np: A NumPy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of objects.
