Identify all distinct connected objects (contiguous blocks of non-white pixels) in the input grid.\n2. For each identified object:\n    a. Determine its rightmost column index (object_max_col).\n    b. Calculate the horizontal shift required to move the object so its rightmost edge aligns with the rightmost column of the grid: shift = grid_width - 1 - object_max_col.\n    c. Record the coordinates and colors of all pixels belonging to the object and its calculated shift.\n3. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).\n4. Place each object onto the output grid by applying its calculated horizontal shift to all of its pixels. If objects overlap after shifting, the pixel colors from objects processed later will overwrite earlier ones.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(input_grid_np):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all connected objects of non-background pixels in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid_np: A NumPy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of objects.
