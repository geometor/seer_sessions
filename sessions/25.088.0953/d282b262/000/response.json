The output grid shows these same objects, preserving their shapes and internal color patterns, but relocated. All objects in the output are positioned such that their rightmost edge aligns with the rightmost column of the grid. The relative vertical positions of the objects are maintained. Objects that might have overlapped horizontally in the input due to their relative positions are also shown overlapping in the output after being moved. The grid dimensions remain constant.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
