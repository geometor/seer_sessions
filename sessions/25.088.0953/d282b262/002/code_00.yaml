task_context:
  description: Shift all non-background elements horizontally to align the rightmost element with the right edge of the grid.
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - dimensions_preserved: True
    - color_palette_preserved: True
input_features:
  - name: object_collection
    description: All non-white pixels in the grid considered as a single group.
    properties:
      - rightmost_column: The maximum column index containing any non-white pixel across the entire grid.
      - pixels: List of coordinates (row, col) and colors for all non-white pixels.
transformation:
  - action: calculate_shift
    input: object_collection.rightmost_column, grid_width
    output: horizontal_shift
    rule: horizontal_shift = (grid_width - 1) - object_collection.rightmost_column
  - action: apply_shift
    input: object_collection.pixels, horizontal_shift
    output: output_grid
    rule: Create a new grid of the same dimensions filled with the background color. For each pixel (row, col, color) in the input object_collection, place its color at the new coordinates (row, col + horizontal_shift) in the output grid.
constraints:
  - Objects maintain their internal structure and relative positions to each other.
  - The entire group of non-white pixels moves by the same horizontal distance.
  - If the input grid contains no non-white pixels, the output is identical to the input.
