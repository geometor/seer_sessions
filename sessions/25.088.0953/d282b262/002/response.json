            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying individual connected objects (non-white pixels) and shifting each object horizontally so its rightmost pixel aligns with the rightmost column of the grid. The comparison between the `Expected Output` and `Transformed Output` reveals that this approach is incorrect.\n\nWhile the code correctly identifies objects and moves them rightward, it fails because it calculates the shift independently for each object. The `Expected Output` shows that all objects in the grid are shifted by the *same* horizontal distance. This distance appears to be determined by the object (or part of an object) that is initially furthest to the right. The entire collection of objects moves as a single unit, preserving their relative horizontal and vertical positions, such that the rightmost pixel of the *entire group* ends up in the last column of the grid.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to:\n1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid.\n2.  Find the maximum column index occupied by *any* non-white pixel across the entire grid.\n3.  Calculate a single horizontal shift value based on this overall maximum column index and the grid width.\n4.  Apply this single shift value to *all* non-white pixels when constructing the output grid.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's analyze the key metrics for each example to confirm the pattern. We'll define an \"object\" as a contiguous group of non-white pixels (using 8-way connectivity). We'll find the rightmost column (`max_col`) for each object and the overall rightmost column (`overall_max_col`) for all objects combined. The required shift should be `grid_width - 1 - overall_max_col`.\n\n"
