Transformation Rule:
1. Identify all distinct connected objects (contiguous blocks of non-white pixels) in the input grid.
2. For each identified object:
    a. Determine its rightmost column index (object_max_col).
    b. Calculate the horizontal shift required to move the object so its rightmost edge aligns with the rightmost column of the grid: shift = grid_width - 1 - object_max_col.
    c. Record the coordinates and colors of all pixels belonging to the object and its calculated shift.
3. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
4. Place each object onto the output grid by applying its calculated horizontal shift to all of its pixels. If objects overlap after shifting, the pixel colors from objects processed later will overwrite earlier ones.

## General Assessment

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying individual connected objects (non-white pixels) and shifting each object horizontally so its rightmost pixel aligns with the rightmost column of the grid. The comparison between the `Expected Output` and `Transformed Output` reveals that this approach is incorrect.

While the code correctly identifies objects and moves them rightward, it fails because it calculates the shift independently for each object. The `Expected Output` shows that all objects in the grid are shifted by the *same* horizontal distance. This distance appears to be determined by the object (or part of an object) that is initially furthest to the right. The entire collection of objects moves as a single unit, preserving their relative horizontal and vertical positions, such that the rightmost pixel of the *entire group* ends up in the last column of the grid.

The strategy to resolve this is to:
1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  Find the maximum column index occupied by *any* non-white pixel across the entire grid.
3.  Calculate a single horizontal shift value based on this overall maximum column index and the grid width.
4.  Apply this single shift value to *all* non-white pixels when constructing the output grid.

## Metrics

Let's analyze the key metrics for each example to confirm the pattern. We'll define an "object" as a contiguous group of non-white pixels (using 8-way connectivity). We'll find the rightmost column (`max_col`) for each object and the overall rightmost column (`overall_max_col`) for all objects combined. The required shift should be `grid_width - 1 - overall_max_col`.

```
The metrics confirm the hypothesis:

*   **Example 1:** 4 objects detected. Individual rightmost columns are 3, 5, 10, 3. The overall rightmost column is 10. Grid width is 15. Calculated shift = (15 - 1) - 10 = 4.
*   **Example 2:** 5 objects detected. Individual rightmost columns are 3, 8, 6, 2, 10. The overall rightmost column is 10. Grid width is 15. Calculated shift = (15 - 1) - 10 = 4.
*   **Example 3:** 5 objects detected. Individual rightmost columns are 3, 11, 7, 12, 3. The overall rightmost column is 12. Grid width is 15. Calculated shift = (15 - 1) - 12 = 2.

In each case, the calculated shift based on the *overall* maximum column index matches the required shift observed by comparing input and expected output.

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  description: Shift all non-background elements horizontally to align the rightmost element with the right edge of the grid.
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - dimensions_preserved: True
    - color_palette_preserved: True
input_features:
  - name: object_collection
    description: All non-white pixels in the grid considered as a single group.
    properties:
      - rightmost_column: The maximum column index containing any non-white pixel across the entire grid.
      - pixels: List of coordinates (row, col) and colors for all non-white pixels.
transformation:
  - action: calculate_shift
    input: object_collection.rightmost_column, grid_width
    output: horizontal_shift
    rule: horizontal_shift = (grid_width - 1) - object_collection.rightmost_column
  - action: apply_shift
    input: object_collection.pixels, horizontal_shift
    output: output_grid
    rule: Create a new grid of the same dimensions filled with the background color. For each pixel (row, col, color) in the input object_collection, place its color at the new coordinates (row, col + horizontal_shift) in the output grid.
constraints:
  - Objects maintain their internal structure and relative positions to each other.
  - The entire group of non-white pixels moves by the same horizontal distance.
  - If the input grid contains no non-white pixels, the output is identical to the input.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid. If there are no non-white pixels, return a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find the maximum column index (`overall_max_col`) among all identified non-white pixels.
3.  Determine the width of the input grid (`grid_width`).
4.  Calculate the horizontal shift required: `shift = (grid_width - 1) - overall_max_col`.
5.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
6.  Iterate through each non-white pixel from the input grid at `(row, col)` with `color`.
7.  Calculate the new column position for this pixel: `new_col = col + shift`.
8.  Place the `color` at `(row, new_col)` in the output grid.
9.  Return the completed output grid.
