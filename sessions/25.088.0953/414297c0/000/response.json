Its dimensions and base color match the large rectangular object identified in the input.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves extracting the large rectangle and then \"copying\" or \"overlaying\" the smaller objects onto it, preserving their relative positions *with respect to the rectangle's top-left corner*. The original background and any parts of the smaller objects outside the bounds of the large rectangle in the input are discarded.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
