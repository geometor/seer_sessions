task_description: Overlay smaller objects onto the largest solid rectangle found in the input grid.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains: objects

  - type: object
    subtype: primary_rectangle
    properties:
      - shape: solid rectangle
      - color: uniform, non-white (e.g., blue, azure, green)
      - size: variable, determined by finding the largest single-colored rectangle in the input
      - role: forms the base canvas and dimensions of the output grid

  - type: object
    subtype: secondary_objects
    properties:
      - shape: variable, contiguous pixels of the same color
      - color: variable, non-white, distinct from the primary rectangle's color
      - quantity: multiple per input grid
      - position: scattered across the input grid, potentially overlapping the primary rectangle
      - role: overlaid onto the output grid

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Secondary objects maintain their position relative to the top-left corner of the primary rectangle when transferred to the output grid.

actions:
  - name: identify_primary_rectangle
    description: Find the largest solid rectangular area composed of a single, non-white color in the input grid.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - primary_rectangle_object (including color, top-left coordinates, height, width)

  - name: identify_secondary_objects
    description: Find all other contiguous non-white objects in the input grid that are not part of the primary rectangle.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - primary_rectangle_object
    outputs:
      - list_of_secondary_objects (each with color, pixel coordinates)

  - name: create_output_grid
    description: Initialize an output grid with the dimensions (height, width) and uniform color of the primary rectangle.
    inputs:
      - primary_rectangle_object
    outputs:
      - output_grid

  - name: overlay_secondary_objects
    description: For each secondary object, map its pixel coordinates from the input grid to the output grid, adjusting for the primary rectangle's top-left corner offset. Place the secondary object's pixels onto the output grid, overwriting the base color.
    inputs:
      - output_grid
      - list_of_secondary_objects
      - primary_rectangle_top_left_coordinates
    outputs:
      - final_output_grid
