Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grid contains a white background (color 0) and several distinct objects composed of colored pixels.
2.  **Objects:** There are two main types of objects identifiable in the input grids:
    *   A single, large, solid rectangular object of a uniform color (blue=1 in train\_1, azure=8 in train\_2, green=3 in train\_3).
    *   Multiple smaller objects of various colors and shapes, scattered across the grid, sometimes overlapping the large rectangle, sometimes separate from it.
3.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is always smaller than the input grid. Its dimensions and base color match the large rectangular object identified in the input.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves extracting the large rectangle and then "copying" or "overlaying" the smaller objects onto it, preserving their relative positions *with respect to the rectangle's top-left corner*. The original background and any parts of the smaller objects outside the bounds of the large rectangle in the input are discarded.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Overlay smaller objects onto the largest solid rectangle found in the input grid.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains: objects

  - type: object
    subtype: primary_rectangle
    properties:
      - shape: solid rectangle
      - color: uniform, non-white (e.g., blue, azure, green)
      - size: variable, determined by finding the largest single-colored rectangle in the input
      - role: forms the base canvas and dimensions of the output grid

  - type: object
    subtype: secondary_objects
    properties:
      - shape: variable, contiguous pixels of the same color
      - color: variable, non-white, distinct from the primary rectangle's color
      - quantity: multiple per input grid
      - position: scattered across the input grid, potentially overlapping the primary rectangle
      - role: overlaid onto the output grid

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Secondary objects maintain their position relative to the top-left corner of the primary rectangle when transferred to the output grid.

actions:
  - name: identify_primary_rectangle
    description: Find the largest solid rectangular area composed of a single, non-white color in the input grid.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - primary_rectangle_object (including color, top-left coordinates, height, width)

  - name: identify_secondary_objects
    description: Find all other contiguous non-white objects in the input grid that are not part of the primary rectangle.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - primary_rectangle_object
    outputs:
      - list_of_secondary_objects (each with color, pixel coordinates)

  - name: create_output_grid
    description: Initialize an output grid with the dimensions (height, width) and uniform color of the primary rectangle.
    inputs:
      - primary_rectangle_object
    outputs:
      - output_grid

  - name: overlay_secondary_objects
    description: For each secondary object, map its pixel coordinates from the input grid to the output grid, adjusting for the primary rectangle's top-left corner offset. Place the secondary object's pixels onto the output grid, overwriting the base color.
    inputs:
      - output_grid
      - list_of_secondary_objects
      - primary_rectangle_top_left_coordinates
    outputs:
      - final_output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Canvas:** Scan the input grid to find the largest solid rectangle composed of a single, non-white color. Note its color (C), dimensions (Height H, Width W), and the coordinates of its top-left corner (Row R, Column Col).
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid (the output grid) with dimensions H rows and W columns. Fill this entire grid with the canvas color C.
3.  **Identify Overlays:** Scan the input grid again to find all pixels that are *not* white (color 0) and *not* part of the identified canvas rectangle.
4.  **Transfer Overlays:** For each non-white, non-canvas pixel found at input coordinates (input\_row, input\_col) with color P:
    *   Calculate its relative position within the canvas rectangle's bounds: `output_row = input_row - R` and `output_col = input_col - Col`.
    *   Check if the calculated `(output_row, output_col)` falls within the bounds of the output grid (i.e., `0 <= output_row < H` and `0 <= output_col < W`).
    *   If it falls within the bounds, update the pixel at `(output_row, output_col)` in the output grid to color P.
5.  **Finalize:** The resulting grid after transferring all overlay pixels is the final output.
