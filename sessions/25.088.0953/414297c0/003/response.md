Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1.  **Identify the Canvas:** Scan the input grid to find the largest possible contiguous rectangular area composed of a single, non-white color. Determine its color, its top-left corner coordinates (row `r`, column `c`), its height `h`, and its width `w`. This rectangle is the "canvas".
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new output grid with height `h` and width `w`. Fill this entire grid with the color of the identified canvas.
3.  **Transfer Figures:** Iterate through every pixel in the input grid at position (`in_r`, `in_c`) with color `p_color`.
4.  **Check Pixel Relevance:** Determine if the current input pixel should be transferred. A pixel is transferred if:
    *   Its color `p_color` is not white (0), AND
    *   It is *not* part of the original canvas block identified in step 1. (i.e., it's either outside the canvas bounds `r <= in_r < r+h` and `c <= in_c < c+w`, OR it's inside the bounds but `p_color` is different from the canvas color).
5.  **Place Pixel:** If the pixel meets the criteria in step 4:
    *   Calculate its target position in the output grid relative to the canvas's top-left corner: `out_r = in_r - r`, `out_c = in_c - c`.
    *   Verify that this target position (`out_r`, `out_c`) falls within the bounds of the output grid (i.e., `0 <= out_r < h` and `0 <= out_c < w`).
    *   If the position is valid, update the output grid at (`out_r`, `out_c`) with the color `p_color`.
6.  **Final Output:** The resulting output grid after checking all input pixels is the final transformed grid.
