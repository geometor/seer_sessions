However, it failed significantly in transferring the foreground elements (other non-white pixels) onto this canvas. The transformed outputs were much smaller than expected and contained only the background color, indicating the pixel overlay logic was either fundamentally flawed or contained bugs.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Verify that the `find_largest_rectangle` function correctly identifies the intended canvas in all examples.\n2.  Re-evaluate and refine the logic for transferring non-canvas, non-white pixels from the input to the output, ensuring correct relative positioning.\n3.  Update the natural language program to accurately reflect this refined understanding.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n\nLet's verify the `find_largest_rectangle` function and gather metrics for each example.\n\n"

The expected canvas is clearly the large 12x11 blue rectangle. The function seems to have stopped prematurely or has a bug in comparing areas/dimensions.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: (16, 20)\n    *   Expected Output: (9, 6), Background: Gray (8)\n    *   `find_largest_rectangle` Found: (7, 4), Color: Gray (8), Pos: (6, 3)\n    *   *Discrepancy*: Again, the found rectangle is smaller than the expected output size (9x6).\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: (16, 18)\n    *   Expected Output: (6, 12), Background: Green (3)\n    *   `find_largest_rectangle` Found: (4, 6), Color: Green (3), Pos: (3, 4)\n    *   *Discrepancy*: Found rectangle is smaller than the expected output size (6x12).\n\n**Conclusion from Metrics:** The primary error lies within the `find_largest_rectangle` function. It fails to identify the largest solid rectangle correctly in all training examples. This incorrect identification leads to the wrong output dimensions and explains why the previous code attempt failed so badly. The overlay logic, while potentially having its own issues, could not function correctly without the correct canvas definition.\n\n**Revised Strategy:** Fix the `find_largest_rectangle` function first. Then, implement the overlay logic based on the *correct* canvas. The overlay logic should be: Initialize the output grid with the canvas's dimensions and color. Iterate through the input grid. If an input pixel is non-white (not 0) and was *not* part of the identified canvas block in the input, calculate its position relative to the canvas's top-left corner and place it in the corresponding position in the output grid, provided that position is within the output grid's bounds.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
