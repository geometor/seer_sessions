Task: Create a solid-colored grid whose dimensions are determined by counting separator lines in the input.

Input:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - colors: Contains exactly two distinct colors.
      - structure: One color forms complete horizontal and/or vertical lines (separator lines) dividing areas filled by the second color (content color).

Output:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - colors: Contains only one color, which is the content color from the input grid.
      - height: Determined by the number of horizontal separator lines in the input grid.
      - width: Determined by the number of vertical separator lines in the input grid.

Transformation:
  - action: identify_colors
    input: input_grid
    output: [separator_color, content_color]
    description: Determine which color forms the complete lines (separator) and which fills the rest (content).
  - action: count_horizontal_lines
    input: input_grid, separator_color
    output: num_h_sep
    description: Count the number of full rows composed entirely of the separator color.
  - action: count_vertical_lines
    input: input_grid, separator_color
    output: num_v_sep
    description: Count the number of full columns composed entirely of the separator color.
  - action: calculate_output_dimensions
    input: num_h_sep, num_v_sep
    output: [output_height, output_width]
    rules:
      - output_height = num_h_sep + 1
      - output_width = num_v_sep + 1
  - action: create_output_grid
    input: output_height, output_width, content_color
    output: output_grid
    description: Generate a grid with the calculated dimensions, filled entirely with the content_color.

Relationships:
  - The input grid is divided into rectangular regions by the separator lines.
  - The number of regions horizontally is equal to the number of horizontal separator lines plus one.
  - The number of regions vertically is equal to the number of vertical separator lines plus one.
  - The output grid's dimensions correspond to the number of these regions.
  - The output grid's color corresponds to the color of these regions in the input.
