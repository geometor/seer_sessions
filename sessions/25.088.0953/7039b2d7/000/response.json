            "text": "**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Composition:** Each input grid consists of exactly two distinct colors.\n2.  **Structure:** One color acts as a background or \"content\" color, filling rectangular areas. The second color forms complete horizontal and/or vertical lines that act as \"separators\", dividing the grid into distinct rectangular regions filled with the content color. A line (row or column) is considered complete if it consists entirely of the separator color across the full width or height of the grid.\n3.  **Output Grid Composition:** The output grid is always a solid rectangle filled with a single color.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The task is to determine the dimensions of the output grid and its fill color based on the structure of the input grid, specifically the separator lines and the content color.\n5.  **Dimension Calculation:**\n    *   The height of the output grid seems related to the number of horizontal separator lines. Specifically, it appears to be `number of horizontal separator lines + 1`.\n    *   The width of the output grid seems related to the number of vertical separator lines. However, the exact relationship (`number of vertical separator lines` vs. `number of vertical separator lines + 1`) appears to depend on the *color* of the separator lines. If the separator is green (3), the width is equal to the number of vertical lines. For other separator colors observed (azure (8), yellow (4)), the width is the number of vertical lines plus one.\n6.  **Color Determination:** The color filling the output grid is consistently the \"content\" color from the input grid (the color that is *not* the separator color).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
