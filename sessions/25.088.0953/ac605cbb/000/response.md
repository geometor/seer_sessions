Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure**: Both inputs and outputs are grids of pixels, primarily white (0), with a few scattered non-white pixels.
2.  **Color Palette**: The key colors involved are white (0, background), gray (5), yellow (4), and various other colors (blue=1, red=2, green=3, magenta=6) representing the initial "objects" or points of interest.
3.  **Core Transformation**: The transformation involves adding new pixels (gray and yellow) to the grid, seemingly connecting the initial non-white pixels. The original non-white pixels always persist in the output grid in their original locations.
4.  **Object Identification**: The non-white pixels in the input can be considered distinct objects or points.
5.  **Pattern/Rule Identification**:
    *   **Multiple Points (>=2)**: When there are two or more non-white pixels in the input, paths are drawn between *every pair* of these points. These paths are L-shaped, composed of a vertical segment and a horizontal segment meeting at a corner. The segments are colored gray (5), and the corner pixel is colored yellow (4). The path segments follow the grid lines (axis-aligned). For a pair of points P1=(r1, c1) and P2=(r2, c2), the corner of the L-path connecting them appears at coordinates (r2, c1). The vertical segment connects (r1, c1) to (r2, c1) and the horizontal segment connects (r2, c2) to (r2, c1). The segments themselves are gray, excluding the endpoints (which retain their original color) and the corner (which becomes yellow). If points are aligned horizontally or vertically, the path between them is a straight gray line segment. Paths can overlap; yellow corners overwrite gray segments, and original pixel colors overwrite any path colors.
    *   **Single Point (==1)**: When there is exactly one non-white pixel in the input (as seen in `train_6`), the rule changes. A vertical gray (5) line is drawn from the top edge of the grid down to the row just above the single pixel, in the same column as the pixel. The original pixel retains its color.

    - elif: c1 == c2 (same column)

    - else: (different row and column)
      - result: L-shaped path
        - corner: C=(r2, c1), color=yellow (4)
        - vertical_segment: From (r1, c1) to (r2, c1), color=gray (5), exclusive of endpoints and corner.
        - horizontal_segment: From (r2, c2) to (r2, c1), color=gray (5), exclusive of endpoints and corner.

color_priority:
  - 1: Original NonWhitePixel color
  - 2: Yellow (4) corner color
  - 3: Gray (5) segment color
  - 4: White (0) background color

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Points**: Find the coordinates and original colors of all pixels in the input grid that are not white (0). Store these as a list of points.
2.  **Count Points**: Count the number of non-white points found (`n`).
3.  **Initialize Output**: Create a new grid by copying the input grid.
4.  **Handle Single Point Case**: If `n` equals 1:
    a.  Let the single point be at `(r, c)`.
    b.  For each row `i` from 0 up to `r-1`, set the pixel at `(i, c)` in the output grid to gray (5).
5.  **Handle Multiple Points Case**: If `n` is greater than or equal to 2:
    a.  Create two temporary sets to store the coordinates of pixels to be colored gray (`gray_coords`) and yellow (`yellow_coords`).
    b.  Iterate through all unique pairs of points, Point A = `(rA, cA)` and Point B = `(rB, cB)`.
    c.  **If A and B are in the same row (`rA == rB`)**: Iterate through all columns `j` strictly between `cA` and `cB`. Add `(rA, j)` to `gray_coords`.
    d.  **If A and B are in the same column (`cA == cB`)**: Iterate through all rows `i` strictly between `rA` and `rB`. Add `(i, cA)` to `gray_coords`.
    e.  **If A and B are in different rows and columns**:
        i.  Define the corner coordinate `C = (rB, cA)`. Add `C` to `yellow_coords`.
        ii. Iterate through all rows `i` strictly between `rA` and `rB`. Add `(i, cA)` to `gray_coords`.
        iii. Iterate through all columns `j` strictly between `cA` and `cB`. Add `(rB, j)` to `gray_coords`.
    f.  **Apply Colors**:
        i.  First, iterate through all coordinates `(r, g)` in `gray_coords`. If the pixel at `(r, g)` in the output grid is currently white (0), set it to gray (5).
        ii. Then, iterate through all coordinates `(r, y)` in `yellow_coords`. Set the pixel at `(r, y)` in the output grid to yellow (4) (this overwrites any gray pixel placed in the previous step, but respects original non-white pixels already present in the copied input).
6.  **Return Result**: The modified output grid is the result.
