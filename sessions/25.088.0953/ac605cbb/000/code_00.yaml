task_description: Connects non-white pixels with L-shaped paths or draws lines from a single pixel.

definitions:
  - object: NonWhitePixel
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0)
      - location: (row, column) coordinates

  - object: Path
    properties:
      - type: L-shape or StraightLine
      - color_segment: gray (5)
      - color_corner: yellow (4) (only for L-shape)
    connects: Pairs of NonWhitePixel objects

rule_conditions:
  - condition: count(NonWhitePixel) == 1
    action: Draw vertical gray line from top edge to pixel row (exclusive).
  - condition: count(NonWhitePixel) >= 2
    action: Connect every pair of NonWhitePixel objects with a Path.

path_construction_details:
  - for_pair: [P1=(r1, c1), P2=(r2, c2)]
    - if: r1 == r2 (same row)
      - result: Straight horizontal gray (5) line between c1 and c2 (exclusive).
    - elif: c1 == c2 (same column)
      - result: Straight vertical gray (5) line between r1 and r2 (exclusive).
    - else: (different row and column)
      - result: L-shaped path
        - corner: C=(r2, c1), color=yellow (4)
        - vertical_segment: From (r1, c1) to (r2, c1), color=gray (5), exclusive of endpoints and corner.
        - horizontal_segment: From (r2, c2) to (r2, c1), color=gray (5), exclusive of endpoints and corner.

color_priority:
  - 1: Original NonWhitePixel color
  - 2: Yellow (4) corner color
  - 3: Gray (5) segment color
  - 4: White (0) background color
