This module transforms an input grid based on the locations of non-white pixels.

Transformation Rule:
1. Find all non-white pixels (points) in the input grid.
2. Count the number of points (n).
3. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4. If n = 1:
    - Let the point be at (r, c).
    - Draw a vertical gray (5) line from the top edge (row 0) down to row r-1 in column c.
5. If n >= 2:
    - For every unique pair of points P1=(r1, c1) and P2=(r2, c2):
        - If P1 and P2 are in the same row (r1 == r2):
            Draw a horizontal gray (5) line segment connecting them (exclusive of endpoints).
        - If P1 and P2 are in the same column (c1 == c2):
            Draw a vertical gray (5) line segment connecting them (exclusive of endpoints).
        - If P1 and P2 are in different rows and columns:
            Draw an L-shaped path:
            - The corner is at C=(r2, c1). Color the corner yellow (4).
            - Draw a vertical gray (5) line segment from P1 towards C (exclusive of endpoints and corner).
            - Draw a horizontal gray (5) line segment from P2 towards C (exclusive of endpoints and corner).
    - Color Priority:
        - Original non-white pixels are preserved.
        - Yellow (4) corners overwrite gray (5) segments and white (0) background.
        - Gray (5) segments only overwrite white (0) background.
