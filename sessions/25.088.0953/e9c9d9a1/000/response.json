If the `pixel` color is white (0):\n    *   Check its position relative to the identified green lines:\n        *   If `row < first_h_line` and `col < first_v_line`, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to red (2).\n        *   If `row < first_h_line` and `col > last_v_line`, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to yellow (4).\n        *   If `row > last_h_line` and `col < first_v_line`, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to blue (1).\n        *   If `row > last_h_line` and `col > last_v_line`, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to azure (8).\n        *   If `row > first_h_line` and `row < last_h_line` and `col > first_v_line` and `col < last_v_line`, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to orange (7).\n7.
