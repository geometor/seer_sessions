Let's call this the \"divider color\". In `train_1`, the divider color is Azure (8); in `train_2`, it's Green (3).\n2.  **Divider Lines:** These divider lines fully span the width (horizontal lines) or height (vertical lines) of the grid. They remain unchanged in the output grid.\n3.  **Regions:** The areas enclosed by the divider lines and/or the grid boundaries form the regions.\n4.  **Source Patterns:** Within each *row* of regions, the pattern of pixels contained within the *leftmost* region (the first region in that row) acts as a source pattern.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves replicating the source pattern from the leftmost region into all other regions within the same horizontal row.\n6.  **Overwriting:** Any original content within the non-leftmost regions in the input grid is ignored and overwritten by the replicated pattern in the output grid.\n7.  **Color Preservation:** The colors of the divider lines and the source patterns are preserved during the replication process. Colors present in the input but not part of the divider lines or the source patterns (e.g., Gray in `train_1`, Magenta in `train_2`) do not appear in the output.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"

Identify the region located in the first column (the leftmost region).\n    b.
