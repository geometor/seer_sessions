## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids are divided into several rectangular subgrids or "regions" by continuous horizontal and vertical lines of a single, non-white color. Let's call this the "divider color". In `train_1`, the divider color is Azure (8); in `train_2`, it's Green (3).
2.  **Divider Lines:** These divider lines fully span the width (horizontal lines) or height (vertical lines) of the grid. They remain unchanged in the output grid.
3.  **Regions:** The areas enclosed by the divider lines and/or the grid boundaries form the regions.
4.  **Source Patterns:** Within each *row* of regions, the pattern of pixels contained within the *leftmost* region (the first region in that row) acts as a source pattern.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves replicating the source pattern from the leftmost region into all other regions within the same horizontal row.
6.  **Overwriting:** Any original content within the non-leftmost regions in the input grid is ignored and overwritten by the replicated pattern in the output grid.
7.  **Color Preservation:** The colors of the divider lines and the source patterns are preserved during the replication process. Colors present in the input but not part of the divider lines or the source patterns (e.g., Gray in `train_1`, Magenta in `train_2`) do not appear in the output.

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
task_description: Replicate patterns within grid regions defined by divider lines.

grid_properties:
  - global_structure: Input grid is partitioned into rectangular regions by continuous horizontal and vertical lines of a single 'divider' color.
  - divider_lines:
      property: Unchanged between input and output.
      identification: Lines of a single non-white color spanning the full grid width or height.
      example_1_color: Azure (8)
      example_2_color: Green (3)
  - regions:
      definition: Rectangular areas bounded by divider lines and/or grid edges.
      organization: Arranged in a grid-like structure (rows and columns of regions).

transformation:
  - name: Regional Pattern Replication
  - steps:
      1: Identify the divider color and the locations of horizontal and vertical divider lines.
      2: Determine the boundaries of each region based on the divider lines and grid edges.
      3: For each row of regions:
          a: Identify the leftmost region in that row.
          b: Extract the pattern of pixels within this leftmost region (excluding the divider lines bounding it). This is the 'source pattern' for the row.
          c: Copy this source pattern into every region within the same row in the output grid.
  - input_elements_used:
      - Divider lines (preserved).
      - Content of the leftmost region in each row of regions (used as source pattern).
  - input_elements_ignored:
      - Content of all regions *not* in the leftmost column (overwritten in the output).
  - output_characteristics:
      - Same dimensions as input.
      - Divider lines identical to input.
      - Each row of regions contains replications of the pattern originally found in the leftmost region of that row in the input.

object_focus:
  - The primary "objects" are the divider lines and the patterns within the source regions.
  - The transformation acts on the regions defined by the divider lines.

priors_used:
  - Objectness: Recognizing the divider lines and the patterns within regions as distinct entities.
  - Geometry & Topology: Understanding lines, rectangles (regions), partitioning, coordinates, and replication/copying.
  - Adjacency: Identifying regions within the same row.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the 'divider color' by finding the non-white color that forms complete horizontal and vertical lines across the grid.
3.  Identify the row indices of the horizontal divider lines and the column indices of the vertical divider lines.
4.  Determine the boundaries (top row, bottom row, left col, right col) of each region defined by these divider lines and the grid edges. Organize these regions into a conceptual grid (rows and columns of regions).
5.  Iterate through each *row* of regions (from top to bottom).
6.  For the current row of regions:
    a.  Identify the region located in the first column (the leftmost region).
    b.  Extract the subgrid corresponding to this leftmost region's content (the area strictly between its bounding divider lines/grid edges). This is the `source_pattern`.
    c.  Iterate through all regions within this *same row* (from left to right).
    d.  For each region in the row, calculate its top-left corner coordinates in the main grid.
    e.  Copy the `source_pattern` into the output grid, placing its top-left corner at the calculated coordinates of the current target region. This overwrites any previous content in that area of the output grid.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
