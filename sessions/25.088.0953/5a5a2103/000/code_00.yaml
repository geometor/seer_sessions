task_description: Replicate patterns within grid regions defined by divider lines.

grid_properties:
  - global_structure: Input grid is partitioned into rectangular regions by continuous horizontal and vertical lines of a single 'divider' color.
  - divider_lines:
      property: Unchanged between input and output.
      identification: Lines of a single non-white color spanning the full grid width or height.
      example_1_color: Azure (8)
      example_2_color: Green (3)
  - regions:
      definition: Rectangular areas bounded by divider lines and/or grid edges.
      organization: Arranged in a grid-like structure (rows and columns of regions).

transformation:
  - name: Regional Pattern Replication
  - steps:
      1: Identify the divider color and the locations of horizontal and vertical divider lines.
      2: Determine the boundaries of each region based on the divider lines and grid edges.
      3: For each row of regions:
          a: Identify the leftmost region in that row.
          b: Extract the pattern of pixels within this leftmost region (excluding the divider lines bounding it). This is the 'source pattern' for the row.
          c: Copy this source pattern into every region within the same row in the output grid.
  - input_elements_used:
      - Divider lines (preserved).
      - Content of the leftmost region in each row of regions (used as source pattern).
  - input_elements_ignored:
      - Content of all regions *not* in the leftmost column (overwritten in the output).
  - output_characteristics:
      - Same dimensions as input.
      - Divider lines identical to input.
      - Each row of regions contains replications of the pattern originally found in the leftmost region of that row in the input.

object_focus:
  - The primary "objects" are the divider lines and the patterns within the source regions.
  - The transformation acts on the regions defined by the divider lines.

priors_used:
  - Objectness: Recognizing the divider lines and the patterns within regions as distinct entities.
  - Geometry & Topology: Understanding lines, rectangles (regions), partitioning, coordinates, and replication/copying.
  - Adjacency: Identifying regions within the same row.
