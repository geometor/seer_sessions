Grid Structure:
  - Property: Divided into rectangular regions by single-color lines.
  - Object: Divider Lines
    - Property: Composed of a single, non-white color.
    - Property: Extend fully horizontally or vertically.
    - Property: The same color is used for all horizontal and vertical divider lines within a grid.
    - Example 1 Color: 8 (azure)
    - Example 2 Color: 3 (green)
  - Object: Regions
    - Property: Rectangular areas bounded by divider lines or grid edges.
    - Property: Arranged in rows and columns.
    - Property: Contain patterns made of various colors, including white (0).

Transformation:
  - Action: Identify divider lines and regions.
  - Action: Process grid row-by-row based on horizontal region boundaries.
  - Condition: For each row of regions:
    - Action: Identify the leftmost region in that row.
    - Action: Extract the exact pixel pattern (Source Pattern) from this leftmost region in the input grid.
    - Action: For every region in that same row (including the leftmost one):
      - Action: Replace the content of that region in the output grid with the Source Pattern.
  - Constraint: Divider lines remain unchanged in the output grid.
  - Constraint: The size and shape of the grid remain unchanged.
