            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding of the task.\n\n**1. General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying divider lines, partitioning the grid into regions, and then copying the entire pattern from the leftmost region into all other regions within the same horizontal band.\n\nThe results clearly show this approach is incorrect. While the divider identification seems accurate (azure '8' in Ex1, green '3' in Ex2), the transformation logic is flawed. The `transformed_output` differs significantly from the `expected_output` in both examples.\n\n*   **Example 1 Mismatch**: The code copied the entire top-left 4x4 region (including white pixels) across the top row. The expected output, however, takes the *color* (red '2') from the top-left object and applies it to the *existing shapes* (non-white pixels) in the other regions of that row. The shapes themselves are preserved, but their color changes to match the leftmost region's object color for that row.\n*   **Example 2 Mismatch**: Similar issues occur. The code copied the leftmost patterns, overwriting existing content incorrectly. The expected output again preserves the shapes within each region but recolors them according to the dominant non-white color found in the leftmost region of that row (yellow '4' for the first row, red '2' for the second, azure '8' for the third, blue '1' for the fourth).\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe core strategy needs refinement. We still need to identify dividers and regions. However, the transformation within each row of regions should be:\n1.  Determine the 'source color' from the leftmost region in that row (likely the single non-white color present, excluding the divider color).\n2.  For *every* region in that row (including the first), identify all pixels that are *not* white and *not* the divider color in the original input grid.\n3.  In the output grid, change the color of these identified pixels to the 'source color' determined in step 1.\n4.  Keep white pixels and divider pixels unchanged.\n\n**2. Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's quantify the differences more precisely using the provided data.\n\n"
