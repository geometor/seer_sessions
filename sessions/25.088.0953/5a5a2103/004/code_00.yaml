task_description: Recolor shapes within grid regions based on the color of the shape in the leftmost region of the same row.

definitions:
  grid: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
  divider_color: A single color used to form complete horizontal and vertical lines partitioning the grid.
  divider_lines: The set of horizontal and vertical lines composed entirely of the divider_color.
  regions: Rectangular areas of the grid bounded by divider lines or grid edges. Regions do not include the divider lines themselves.
  row_of_regions: A set of regions located horizontally between two consecutive horizontal divider lines (or grid edge and divider line).
  source_color: For a given row_of_regions, the single non-white color found within the pixels of the leftmost region in the input grid. Assumes only one such color exists per leftmost region.
  target_pixels: Within any given region in the input grid, all pixels that are not white (0) and not the divider_color.

transformation:
  - identify: The single divider_color present in the input grid.
  - identify: The row and column indices of all divider_lines.
  - partition: Define the boundaries of all regions based on the divider_lines and grid edges.
  - group: Group regions into rows_of_regions based on horizontal divider lines.
  - process: For each row_of_regions:
      - determine: The source_color by examining the leftmost region in the input grid. Find the non-white, non-divider color within it.
      - iterate: Through each region within the current row_of_regions.
          - identify: All target_pixels within the current region in the input grid.
          - update: In the output grid, set the color of these target_pixels to the determined source_color for this row_of_regions.
  - preserve: All pixels belonging to divider_lines retain their divider_color in the output grid.
  - preserve: All white pixels (color 0) remain white in the output grid, unless they were part of a shape being recolored (which shouldn't happen if they were white initially).
