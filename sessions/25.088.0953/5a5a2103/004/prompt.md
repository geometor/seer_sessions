"""
The transformation identifies horizontal and vertical lines of a single 'divider'
color that partition the input grid into rectangular regions. For each row of regions
(defined by the horizontal dividers), it identifies the pattern within the leftmost
region of that row in the input grid. This 'source pattern' is then replicated into
all other regions within that same row in the output grid, overwriting their original
content. The divider lines remain unchanged in the output.
