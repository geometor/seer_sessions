            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying horizontal and vertical divider lines, partitioning the grid into regions, and then recoloring shapes within each horizontal band based on the color found in the leftmost region of that band.\n\nHowever, the execution results show that the `transform` function returns the original input grid unchanged for both examples, indicating a failure in the core transformation logic. The discrepancies are significant, with many pixels having the wrong color in the transformed output compared to the expected output.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Verify Divider and Region Identification:** Use code execution to confirm if the `find_divider_color_and_lines` function correctly identifies the divider color (azure=8 for Ex1, green=3 for Ex2) and the line indices. Also, verify the calculated region boundaries (`row_starts`, `row_ends`, `col_starts`, `col_ends`).\n2.  **Verify Source Color Identification:** Check if the code correctly extracts the leftmost region for each horizontal band and identifies the single non-white, non-divider color within it as the `source_color`.\n3.  **Debug Recolor Logic:** The most likely issue lies in the nested loops that are supposed to perform the recoloring (`for r_local...`, `for c_local...`). Examine why the condition `if original_color != 0 and original_color != divider_color:` might not be leading to the assignment `output_grid[current_r, current_c] = source_color`, or why the `source_color` might be `None` when it shouldn't be. Perhaps the logic for handling multiple potential source colors or ambiguous cases is preventing the recoloring.\n4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program based on the verified steps and debugging insights to accurately describe the successful transformation process.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's execute parts of the provided code to understand its intermediate steps for both examples.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n"

Looking at the function's logic, it requires the divider color to be the *sole* color forming *all* horizontal lines *and* the *sole* color forming *all* vertical lines (if both exist).\n    *   Horizontal lines: Rows 4 and 9 are entirely azure (8).\n    *   Vertical lines: Columns 4 and 9 are entirely azure (8).\n    *   Since azure (8) is indeed the only color forming these full lines, the function *should* identify it. Let's re-examine the logic. The conditions `is_sole_h_color` and `is_sole_v_color` combined with `(forms_any_h or forms_any_v)` seem correct. Why might it fail? Perhaps `potential_divider_colors` doesn't correctly capture 8, or the checks `is_sole_h_color`/`is_sole_v_color` are too strict or incorrectly implemented. Let's rethink the divider identification logic. A simpler approach might be to find the color that constitutes *all* full-width horizontal lines and *all* full-height vertical lines, excluding white.\n*   **Example 2:** It failed to identify green (3) as the divider.\n    *   Horizontal lines: Rows 4, 9, 14 are entirely green (3).\n    *   Vertical lines: Columns 4, 9, 14 are entirely green (3).\n    *   Again, green (3) is the only color forming these lines. The function's failure suggests a flaw in its logic for identifying the unique divider color.\n\nBecause the `divider_color` is `None`, the code calculates only one large region (the entire grid) for each example and finds no `source_color`. Consequently, the recoloring loops are never effectively executed, and the input is returned unchanged. The primary issue is the unreliable `find_divider_color_and_lines` function.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
