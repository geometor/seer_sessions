task_description: Recolor objects within grid regions based on a template color found in the leftmost region of the same horizontal band.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - divider_lines:
      description: Full horizontal and vertical lines composed of a single, non-white color that partition the grid.
      properties:
        - orientation: horizontal, vertical
        - color: uniform within all divider lines (azure=8 in ex1, green=3 in ex2)
        - thickness: 1 pixel
  - regions:
      description: Rectangular areas formed by the intersection of areas between horizontal and vertical divider lines.
      properties:
        - content: Can contain background pixels and/or objects of various colors.

objects:
  - type: divider_line
    color: The single color forming all full horizontal/vertical lines (excluding white).
  - type: content_object
    description: Contiguous block(s) of non-white, non-divider color pixels within a region.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0) and the divider color.
      - location: Resides within a specific region.

actions:
  - name: identify_dividers
    input: input_grid
    output: divider_color, horizontal_divider_indices, vertical_divider_indices
  - name: partition_grid
    input: input_grid, divider_indices
    output: list_of_regions (defined by row/col start/end indices)
  - name: identify_source_color_per_band
    input: input_grid, regions, divider_color
    process: For each horizontal band of regions (defined by horizontal dividers), find the single non-white, non-divider color present in the leftmost region.
    output: mapping_of_band_to_source_color
  - name: recolor_regions
    input: input_grid, regions, source_color_map, divider_color
    output: output_grid
    process: Create a copy of the input grid. For each region, identify all pixels belonging to content_objects (i.e., not white and not the divider color). Recolor these pixels in the output grid using the source_color associated with the horizontal band the region belongs to. Keep divider lines and white background pixels unchanged.

relationship: The color of content_objects in the output grid depends on their horizontal band and the color of the content_object found in the first (leftmost) region of that same band in the input grid.
