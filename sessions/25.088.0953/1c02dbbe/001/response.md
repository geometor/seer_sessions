Transformation Rule:

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Identify all locations (r, c) in the input grid containing "marker pixels" (colors other than white '0' and gray '5').
3. Change the color of these identified marker pixel locations in the output grid to white ('0').
4. Determine the set of unique marker colors `C` present in the input grid (excluding white '0' and gray '5').
5. For each unique marker color `C`:
    a. Find all locations `(r_marker, c_marker)` where the input grid contains color `C`.
    b. Calculate the minimum row (`min_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), maximum row (`max_r`), and maximum column (`max_c`) among these locations to define a bounding box for color `C`.
    c. Iterate through all grid cells `(r_fill, c_fill)` within this bounding box (inclusive).
    d. For each cell `(r_fill, c_fill)` within the bounding box, check if the color of the corresponding cell in the *original input grid* is gray ('5').
    e. If the original input cell `(r_fill, c_fill)` was gray ('5'), update the color of the cell `(r_fill, c_fill)` in the *output grid* to the current marker color `C`.
6. The final output grid reflects these changes: marker pixels are removed (become white), parts of the original gray object are recolored according to the bounding boxes of the marker colors, and the remaining parts of the gray object and the background stay as they were (gray and white, respectively).
