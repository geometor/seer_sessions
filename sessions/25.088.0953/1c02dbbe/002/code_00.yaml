task_name: 6150a2bd
grid_properties:
  size_preservation: True # Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid
  background_color: 0 # White
objects:
  - type: background
    color: 0
    persistence: remains background unless overwritten by fill
  - type: primary_shape
    color: 5 # Gray
    contiguity: contiguous block
    role: target_for_coloring
    persistence: remains gray unless within a bounding box
  - type: marker
    color: any color except 0 (white) and 5 (gray)
    count: multiple instances, potentially multiple colors per grid
    contiguity: typically single pixels, but could be multiple adjacent
    role: define_region, define_fill_color
    persistence: removed (set to color 0) in output
actions:
  - name: identify_markers
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: set of marker coordinates grouped by color
  - name: calculate_bounding_boxes
    inputs: marker coordinates per color
    outputs: min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col for each color
    calculation: find extents (min/max row and col) of all markers of a given color
  - name: erase_markers
    inputs: input_grid, marker_coordinates
    outputs: modified_grid
    effect: set marker locations to color 0
  - name: fill_regions
    inputs: input_grid (for reference), modified_grid (to update), bounding_boxes, marker_colors
    outputs: final_output_grid
    effect: for each color C and its bounding box B:
              iterate through all cells (r, c) within B:
                if input_grid[r, c] == 5 (gray):
                  modified_grid[r, c] = C
