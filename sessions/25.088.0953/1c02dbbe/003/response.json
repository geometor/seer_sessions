Marker pixels are defined as any pixel whose color is *not* white (0) and *not* gray (5). Record the location (row, column) and color of each marker pixel.\n3. For every identified marker pixel location in the input grid, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to white (0).\n4. Group the identified marker pixel locations by their color.\n5. For each unique marker color `C` found in step 2:\n    a. Determine the rectangular bounding box that minimally encloses *all* marker pixels of color `C`. This box is defined by the minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, and maximum column of the locations of markers with color `C`.\n    b. Iterate through every grid cell `(r, c)` within this bounding box (inclusive of the boundary rows and columns).\n    c. For each cell `(r, c)` inside the bounding box, check the color of the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the **original input grid**.\n    d. If the color in the **original input grid** at `(r, c)` is gray (5), then update the color of the cell `(r, c)` in the **output grid** to the current marker color `C`.\n6.
