Transformation Rule:

1.  **Initialize:** Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  **Identify Markers and Regions:**
    a.  Find all "marker pixels" in the input grid (pixels neither white (0) nor gray (5)). Record the location (row, column) and color of each marker pixel. Store these in a list `all_markers`.
    b.  Group the marker pixel locations by their color into a dictionary `marker_locations_by_color`.
    c.  For each unique marker color `C` found:
        i.  Determine the rectangular bounding box `B_C` that minimally encloses all marker pixels of color `C`. Store these bounding boxes, e.g., in `bboxes_by_color`.
        ii. Identify the set of coordinates `F_C` (the "fill region") corresponding to pixels that are gray (5) in the *input* grid and fall within the bounding box `B_C`. Store these fill regions, e.g., in `fill_regions_by_color`.
3.  **Apply Fill:**
    a.  For each unique marker color `C` and its corresponding fill region `F_C`:
        i.  Iterate through every coordinate `(r, c)` in the fill region `F_C`.
        ii. Set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to color `C`.
4.  **Handle Original Markers:**
    a.  Iterate through *all* original marker pixel locations `(r, c)` with their original color `C_marker` from the `all_markers` list.
    b.  Retrieve the bounding box `B_{C_marker}` calculated for that specific color `C_marker` from `bboxes_by_color`.
    c.  Check if the location `(r, c)` is contained within the bounding box `B_{C_marker}`.
    d.  If `(r, c)` is **within** `B_{C_marker}`:
        i.  Set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to `C_marker`. (This ensures the marker persists, potentially overwriting a color filled in step 3 if bounding boxes overlap).
    e.  If `(r, c)` is **not within** `B_{C_marker}`:
        i.  Set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to white (0). (This erases markers used only to define the box extent).
5.  **Return:** Return the final modified output grid.
