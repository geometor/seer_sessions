The rest of the grid is primarily white (0) background, with a few scattered, single pixels of other colors (e.g., red, green, blue, yellow, magenta). These non-gray, non-white pixels act as \"markers\" or \"commands\".\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid retains the white background and the overall position of the original gray area. However, the gray area is partially or fully recolored. The original marker pixels disappear (become white) in the output.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves using the marker pixels to define rectangular regions within the original gray area. For each distinct marker color present in the input:\n    *   The locations of all pixels of that specific marker color define a bounding box.\n    *   Any gray pixel from the input grid that falls within this bounding box is recolored to that marker color in the output grid.\n    *   If a gray pixel falls within the bounding boxes defined by multiple different marker colors (though this doesn't seem to happen in the examples, based on the non-overlapping nature of the output colored regions), a precedence rule would be needed. However, the examples suggest the fill regions defined by different colors are spatially distinct *within the gray object*.\n    *   Gray pixels from the input that do not fall into any marker-defined bounding box remain gray in the output.\n    *   The original marker pixels are erased (set to white) in the output.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
