## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains a large, contiguous block of gray (5) pixels, typically forming a rectangle or near-rectangle. The rest of the grid is primarily white (0) background, with a few scattered, single pixels of other colors (e.g., red, green, blue, yellow, magenta). These non-gray, non-white pixels act as "markers" or "commands".
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid retains the white background and the overall position of the original gray area. However, the gray area is partially or fully recolored. The original marker pixels disappear (become white) in the output.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves using the marker pixels to define rectangular regions within the original gray area. For each distinct marker color present in the input:
    *   The locations of all pixels of that specific marker color define a bounding box.
    *   Any gray pixel from the input grid that falls within this bounding box is recolored to that marker color in the output grid.
    *   If a gray pixel falls within the bounding boxes defined by multiple different marker colors (though this doesn't seem to happen in the examples, based on the non-overlapping nature of the output colored regions), a precedence rule would be needed. However, the examples suggest the fill regions defined by different colors are spatially distinct *within the gray object*.
    *   Gray pixels from the input that do not fall into any marker-defined bounding box remain gray in the output.
    *   The original marker pixels are erased (set to white) in the output.

## Facts

task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array representing the input and output space using colors 0-9.
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The predominant empty space in the grid.
    persistence: Remains unchanged in the output, except where marker pixels were located.
  - element: gray_object
    description: A large, contiguous object composed of gray (5) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: Roughly rectangular block.
      - role: The target area for recoloring.
    persistence: Its location persists, but its internal pixels may change color. Pixels not recolored remain gray.
  - element: marker_pixels
    description: Isolated pixels of colors other than white (0) or gray (5).
    properties:
      - color: Variable (red, green, blue, yellow, magenta observed).
      - quantity: Can be multiple pixels, potentially of different colors in one input.
      - location: Scattered, often near the gray_object.
      - role: Define rectangular regions and the color used to fill those regions within the gray_object.
    persistence: Removed (become white) in the output grid.
  - element: derived_fill_region
    description: A rectangular area derived from the locations of marker pixels of a specific color.
    properties:
      - definition: The bounding box encompassing all marker pixels of a single color C.
      - purpose: To designate which part of the gray_object should be recolored with color C.
    relationship: The fill operation happens at the intersection of this region and the original gray_object.

transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify the locations of all gray (5) pixels (the gray_object).
  - step: 2
    action: Identify all unique marker colors (non-white, non-gray) and their locations.
  - step: 3
    action: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: 4
    action: Change the color of all marker pixel locations in the output grid to white (0).
  - step: 5
    action: For each unique marker color C:
      - sub_step: 5a
        action: Find all locations (r, c) where the input grid has color C.
      - sub_step: 5b
        action: Determine the bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) for these locations.
      - sub_step: 5c
        action: For every location (r_fill, c_fill) within this bounding box:
          - sub_sub_step: 5c.i
            action: Check if the input grid at (r_fill, c_fill) is gray (5).
          - sub_sub_step: 5c.ii
            action: If it is gray, change the output grid at (r_fill, c_fill) to color C.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all locations `(r, c)` in the input grid containing "marker pixels" (colors other than white '0' and gray '5').
3.  Change the color of these identified marker pixel locations in the output grid to white ('0').
4.  Determine the set of unique marker colors `C` present in the input grid.
5.  For each unique marker color `C`:
    a.  Find all locations `(r_marker, c_marker)` where the input grid contains color `C`.
    b.  Calculate the minimum row (`min_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), maximum row (`max_r`), and maximum column (`max_c`) among these locations to define a bounding box for color `C`.
    c.  Iterate through all grid cells `(r_fill, c_fill)` such that `min_r <= r_fill <= max_r` and `min_c <= c_fill <= max_c`.
    d.  For each cell `(r_fill, c_fill)` within the bounding box, check the color of the corresponding cell in the *original input grid*.
    e.  If the original input cell `(r_fill, c_fill)` was gray ('5'), update the color of the cell `(r_fill, c_fill)` in the *output grid* to the current marker color `C`.
6.  The final output grid reflects these changes: marker pixels are removed (become white), parts of the original gray object are recolored according to the bounding boxes of the marker colors, and the remaining parts of the gray object and the background stay as they were (gray and white, respectively).
