task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array representing the input and output space using colors 0-9.
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The predominant empty space in the grid.
    persistence: Remains unchanged in the output, except where marker pixels were located.
  - element: gray_object
    description: A large, contiguous object composed of gray (5) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: Roughly rectangular block.
      - role: The target area for recoloring.
    persistence: Its location persists, but its internal pixels may change color. Pixels not recolored remain gray.
  - element: marker_pixels
    description: Isolated pixels of colors other than white (0) or gray (5).
    properties:
      - color: Variable (red, green, blue, yellow, magenta observed).
      - quantity: Can be multiple pixels, potentially of different colors in one input.
      - location: Scattered, often near the gray_object.
      - role: Define rectangular regions and the color used to fill those regions within the gray_object.
    persistence: Removed (become white) in the output grid.
  - element: derived_fill_region
    description: A rectangular area derived from the locations of marker pixels of a specific color.
    properties:
      - definition: The bounding box encompassing all marker pixels of a single color C.
      - purpose: To designate which part of the gray_object should be recolored with color C.
    relationship: The fill operation happens at the intersection of this region and the original gray_object.

transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify the locations of all gray (5) pixels (the gray_object).
  - step: 2
    action: Identify all unique marker colors (non-white, non-gray) and their locations.
  - step: 3
    action: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: 4
    action: Change the color of all marker pixel locations in the output grid to white (0).
  - step: 5
    action: For each unique marker color C:
      - sub_step: 5a
        action: Find all locations (r, c) where the input grid has color C.
      - sub_step: 5b
        action: Determine the bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) for these locations.
      - sub_step: 5c
        action: For every location (r_fill, c_fill) within this bounding box:
          - sub_sub_step: 5c.i
            action: Check if the input grid at (r_fill, c_fill) is gray (5).
          - sub_sub_step: 5c.ii
            action: If it is gray, change the output grid at (r_fill, c_fill) to color C.
