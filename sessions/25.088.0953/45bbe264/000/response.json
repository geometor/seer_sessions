            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids are sparsely populated, containing mostly white (0) pixels and a small number of isolated, non-white pixels. These non-white pixels act as \"seeds\" or \"source points\".\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids are derived from the input grids. They feature horizontal and vertical lines extending from the locations of the input source pixels. The lines take the color of their respective source pixels.\n3.  **Line Generation:** For each non-white source pixel in the input, a horizontal line spanning the grid's width is drawn through its row, and a vertical line spanning the grid's height is drawn through its column. Both lines use the color of the source pixel.\n4.  **Intersection Points:** Special handling occurs at the intersection points:\n    *   The location of an original source pixel retains its original color, even though it's the intersection of its own horizontal and vertical lines.\n    *   Where a horizontal line generated from source pixel A intersects with a vertical line generated from a *different* source pixel B, the intersection point is colored Red (2).\n5.  **Background:** Pixels that are not part of any generated line and were originally white remain white.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Set the color of the pixel at location (`Rb`, `Ca`) in the output grid to Red (2).\n5.  Finally, iterate through all the original source pixels again. For each source pixel with original color `C` at location (`R`, `L`):\n    a.  Set the color of the pixel at location (`R`, `L`) in the output grid back to its original color `C`. This ensures the source pixel's location has priority over any intersection coloring.\n6.  The resulting grid is the final output."
