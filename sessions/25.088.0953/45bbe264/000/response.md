Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids are sparsely populated, containing mostly white (0) pixels and a small number of isolated, non-white pixels. These non-white pixels act as "seeds" or "source points".
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids are derived from the input grids. They feature horizontal and vertical lines extending from the locations of the input source pixels. The lines take the color of their respective source pixels.
3.  **Line Generation:** For each non-white source pixel in the input, a horizontal line spanning the grid's width is drawn through its row, and a vertical line spanning the grid's height is drawn through its column. Both lines use the color of the source pixel.
4.  **Intersection Points:** Special handling occurs at the intersection points:
    *   The location of an original source pixel retains its original color, even though it's the intersection of its own horizontal and vertical lines.
    *   Where a horizontal line generated from source pixel A intersects with a vertical line generated from a *different* source pixel B, the intersection point is colored Red (2).
5.  **Background:** Pixels that are not part of any generated line and were originally white remain white.

task_description: Draw crosses and mark intersections.
elements:
  - type: grid
    role: input
    properties:
      - sparse non-white pixels (sources) on a white background
  - type: grid
    role: output
    properties:
      - same dimensions as input
      - contains horizontal and vertical lines originating from source pixel locations
      - specific color (Red) at intersections of lines from different sources
objects:
  - name: source_pixel
    identified_by: any non-white pixel (value > 0) in the input grid
    properties:
      - color: the pixel's value (1-9)
      - location: row and column index (r, c)
  - name: horizontal_line
    generated_from: source_pixel
    properties:
      - row: same row as the source pixel
      - color: same color as the source pixel
      - extends: across the full width of the grid
  - name: vertical_line
    generated_from: source_pixel
    properties:
      - column: same column as the source pixel
      - color: same color as the source pixel
      - extends: across the full height of the grid
  - name: intersection_point
    identified_by: crossing of a horizontal_line and a vertical_line
    properties:
      - location: (row of horizontal_line, column of vertical_line)
      - color:
          - Red (2), if the lines originate from *different* source pixels.
          - Original color of the source pixel, if the lines originate from the *same* source pixel (i.e., the location of the source pixel itself).
relationships:
  - A source_pixel generates one horizontal_line and one vertical_line of its own color.
  - Lines overwrite the background (white pixels).
  - Where lines overlap, specific rules apply (see intersection_point color).
actions:
  - Identify all source_pixels in the input grid.
  - For each source_pixel:
      - Draw its corresponding horizontal_line onto the output grid.
      - Draw its corresponding vertical_line onto the output grid.
  - For every pair of distinct source_pixels (A and B):
      - Find the intersection point of A's horizontal_line and B's vertical_line. Color it Red (2).
      - Find the intersection point of B's horizontal_line and A's vertical_line. Color it Red (2).
  - For every source_pixel:
      - Ensure its original location in the output grid retains its original color (overwriting any Red intersection color if necessary).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid. Let's call these "source pixels" and store their locations (row, column) and colors.
3.  For each identified source pixel with color `C` at location (`R`, `L`):
    a.  Fill the entire row `R` of the output grid with color `C`.
    b.  Fill the entire column `L` of the output grid with color `C`.
4.  Iterate through all unique pairs of *different* source pixels. Let source pixel A be at (`Ra`, `Ca`) and source pixel B be at (`Rb`, `Cb`).
    a.  Set the color of the pixel at location (`Ra`, `Cb`) in the output grid to Red (2).
    b.  Set the color of the pixel at location (`Rb`, `Ca`) in the output grid to Red (2).
5.  Finally, iterate through all the original source pixels again. For each source pixel with original color `C` at location (`R`, `L`):
    a.  Set the color of the pixel at location (`R`, `L`) in the output grid back to its original color `C`. This ensures the source pixel's location has priority over any intersection coloring.
6.  The resulting grid is the final output.
