Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** Each input grid contains a background of white pixels (0), a single blue pixel (1), and a single red pixel (2). The positions of the blue and red pixels vary across examples.
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid retains the original blue and red pixels in their input positions. Additionally, a path of green pixels (3) is introduced.
3.  **Green Path:** The green path visually connects the region *between* the blue and red pixels. It appears to be a discrete line segment (like one drawn with Bresenham's algorithm).
4.  **Relationship:** The green path starts one step away from the blue pixel and ends one step away from the red pixel, following the line segment connecting them. The path itself does *not* include the original blue or red pixel locations.
5.  **Colors Involved:** Input uses White(0), Blue(1), Red(2). Output adds Green(3).
6.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all four training examples. The line characteristics (more horizontal vs. more vertical, direction) change based on the relative positions of the blue and red pixels, but the principle of drawing the connecting line segment (excluding endpoints) remains consistent.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the coordinates (row, column) of the single blue pixel (color 1) in the input grid. Call these `blue_coords`.
2.  Identify the coordinates (row, column) of the single red pixel (color 2) in the input grid. Call these `red_coords`.
3.  Initialize the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
4.  Calculate the sequence of pixel coordinates that form a discrete straight line segment starting from `blue_coords` and ending at `red_coords`. Use an algorithm like Bresenham's line algorithm to determine these intermediate pixel coordinates.
5.  Iterate through the calculated sequence of coordinates. For every coordinate in the sequence, *except* for the very first coordinate (`blue_coords`) and the very last coordinate (`red_coords`), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to green (color 3).
6.  The final modified grid is the result.
