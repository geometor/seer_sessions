The positions of the blue and red pixels vary across examples.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid retains the original blue and red pixels in their input positions. Additionally, a path of green pixels (3) is introduced.\n3.  **Green Path:** The green path visually connects the region *between* the blue and red pixels. It appears to be a discrete line segment (like one drawn with Bresenham's algorithm).\n4.  **Relationship:** The green path starts one step away from the blue pixel and ends one step away from the red pixel, following the line segment connecting them. The path itself does *not* include the original blue or red pixel locations.\n5.  **Colors Involved:** Input uses White(0), Blue(1), Red(2). Output adds Green(3).\n6.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all four training examples. The line characteristics (more horizontal vs. more vertical, direction) change based on the relative positions of the blue and red pixels, but the principle of drawing the connecting line segment (excluding endpoints) remains consistent.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
