task_description: Draw a line segment between the blue and red pixels, coloring the intermediate path green.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - dimensions: Variable (e.g., 13x12, 15x12, 15x16, 16x16)
objects:
  - type: pixel
    color: 1 (blue)
    quantity: 1
    role: start_point_reference
  - type: pixel
    color: 2 (red)
    quantity: 1
    role: end_point_reference
  - type: path
    color: 3 (green)
    role: connecting_element
    exists_in: output_only
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The green path follows a discrete line segment connecting the locations of the blue and red pixels.
  - type: exclusion
    description: The green path includes all pixels on the line segment *except* for the start (blue pixel location) and end (red pixel location) points.
actions:
  - action: find
    target: blue pixel (1)
    result: coordinates (start_row, start_col)
  - action: find
    target: red pixel (2)
    result: coordinates (end_row, end_col)
  - action: generate_line_path
    start_coords: (start_row, start_col)
    end_coords: (end_row, end_col)
    algorithm: Discrete line algorithm (e.g., Bresenham's)
    result: sequence of pixel coordinates [(r0, c0), (r1, c1), ..., (rn, cn)]
  - action: draw
    target: output grid
    color: 3 (green)
    pixels: All coordinates from the generated line path *except* the first (start_coords) and the last (end_coords).
  - action: copy
    source: input grid
    target: output grid
    elements: All pixels (initial state before drawing green path)
