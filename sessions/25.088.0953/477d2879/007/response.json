This simulates a Voronoi diagram constrained by walls, \n    where regions are defined by the closest seed. Ties in distance are broken \n    by choosing the seed with the numerically lower color value.\n\n    1. Identify Objects & Initialize: Copy the input grid to the output grid. \n       Locate all 'seed' pixels (colors 2-9). Create a distance grid \n       initialized with infinity and a queue for Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n    2. Place Seeds: For each seed pixel at location (r, c) with color \n       `seed_color`, set its distance to 0 in the distance grid and add its \n       location to the BFS queue. The output grid already contains the seed color\n       from the initial copy.\n    3. Expand Colors (BFS): Perform a multi-source BFS. While the queue is not \n       empty, dequeue a location (r, c). For each valid neighbor (nr, nc):\n        a. Validity Check: A neighbor is valid if it's within grid bounds AND \n           if the corresponding cell in the *input* grid is empty space (color 0).\n        b. Calculate Distance: Calculate the new distance from the originating \n           seed via the current path (distance at (r, c) + 1).\n        c. Update on Shorter Path: If the new distance is shorter than the \n           recorded distance for the neighbor (nr, nc), update the neighbor's \n           distance, set its color in the *output* grid to the color being \n           propagated (the color of the cell (r, c) in the output grid), and \n           enqueue the neighbor.\n        d. Tie-Breaking: If the new distance is equal to the recorded distance \n           for the neighbor, compare the currently propagated color with the \n           neighbor's existing color in the output grid. If the current \n           propagated color is numerically smaller, update the neighbor's color \n           in the output grid.\n    4. Return Output: Once the BFS is complete, the output grid contains the \n       filled regions constrained by the walls.
