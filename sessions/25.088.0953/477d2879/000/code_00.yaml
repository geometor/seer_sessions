Grid_Properties:
  - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - background_color_input: White (0)
  - boundary_like_color_input: Blue (1)
  - background_color_output: None (all white pixels are replaced)
  - boundary_like_color_output: None (all blue pixels are replaced)

Objects_And_Colors:
  - name: Seed Pixels
    description: Pixels in the input grid that are neither white (0) nor blue (1).
    properties:
      - color: Any color except 0 or 1.
      - role: Act as starting points for color expansion.
      - persistence: Retain their original color and position in the output grid.
  - name: Fillable Pixels
    description: Pixels in the input grid that are either white (0) or blue (1).
    properties:
      - color: White (0) or Blue (1).
      - role: These pixels are targeted for color replacement in the output.
  - name: Output Regions
    description: Contiguous areas of the same color in the output grid.
    properties:
      - color: Derived from the color of the nearest Seed Pixel from the input.
      - formation: Result from a flood-fill like expansion process originating from Seed Pixels.

Actions_And_Transformations:
  - action: Flood Fill / Expansion
    description: Colors from Seed Pixels expand outwards to fill adjacent Fillable Pixels (white or blue).
    mechanism: Seems analogous to a Breadth-First Search (BFS) where expansion occurs layer by layer from each seed simultaneously.
  - action: Color Replacement
    description: Every Fillable Pixel (white or blue in input) is assigned the color of the 'closest' Seed Pixel.
    closeness_metric: Based on grid distance (number of steps needed for the flood fill to reach the pixel).
  - action: Tie-Breaking
    description: If a Fillable Pixel is equidistant from multiple Seed Pixels of different colors, a consistent rule determines the final color.
    rule: Observation suggests the Seed Pixel with the lower color index (value) wins the tie. (e.g., Red(2) wins over Azure(8)).

Relationships:
  - relationship: Seed Pixels to Output Regions
    description: Each Seed Pixel determines the color of the region surrounding it in the output grid.
  - relationship: Fillable Pixels to Seed Pixels
    description: The final color of a Fillable Pixel in the output depends on its shortest path distance to the various Seed Pixels in the input.
