Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of the same dimensions (13x13 in all examples).
2.  **Colors:** The input grids contain various colors, including white (0) and blue (1). The output grids contain colors present in the input, *except* for white (0) and blue (1).
3.  **Background:** The white (0) pixels in the input are always filled with some other color in the output.
4.  **Blue Pixels (Color 1):** The blue (1) pixels in the input seem to act as separators or boundaries initially, but they are also replaced with other colors in the output.
5.  **Other Colors:** Non-white, non-blue pixels in the input generally retain their color and position in the output. These seem to act as "seeds".
6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a type of "flood fill" or region expansion. The areas initially occupied by white (0) and blue (1) pixels are filled based on the colors of the nearest non-white, non-blue "seed" pixels. Blue pixels do not block the fill; they are filled themselves.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - background_color_input: White (0)
  - boundary_like_color_input: Blue (1)
  - background_color_output: None (all white pixels are replaced)
  - boundary_like_color_output: None (all blue pixels are replaced)

Objects_And_Colors:
  - name: Seed Pixels
    description: Pixels in the input grid that are neither white (0) nor blue (1).
    properties:
      - color: Any color except 0 or 1.
      - role: Act as starting points for color expansion.
      - persistence: Retain their original color and position in the output grid.
  - name: Fillable Pixels
    description: Pixels in the input grid that are either white (0) or blue (1).
    properties:
      - color: White (0) or Blue (1).
      - role: These pixels are targeted for color replacement in the output.
  - name: Output Regions
    description: Contiguous areas of the same color in the output grid.
    properties:
      - color: Derived from the color of the nearest Seed Pixel from the input.
      - formation: Result from a flood-fill like expansion process originating from Seed Pixels.

Actions_And_Transformations:
  - action: Flood Fill / Expansion
    description: Colors from Seed Pixels expand outwards to fill adjacent Fillable Pixels (white or blue).
    mechanism: Seems analogous to a Breadth-First Search (BFS) where expansion occurs layer by layer from each seed simultaneously.
  - action: Color Replacement
    description: Every Fillable Pixel (white or blue in input) is assigned the color of the 'closest' Seed Pixel.
    closeness_metric: Based on grid distance (number of steps needed for the flood fill to reach the pixel).
  - action: Tie-Breaking
    description: If a Fillable Pixel is equidistant from multiple Seed Pixels of different colors, a consistent rule determines the final color.
    rule: Observation suggests the Seed Pixel with the lower color index (value) wins the tie. (e.g., Red(2) wins over Azure(8)).

Relationships:
  - relationship: Seed Pixels to Output Regions
    description: Each Seed Pixel determines the color of the region surrounding it in the output grid.
  - relationship: Fillable Pixels to Seed Pixels
    description: The final color of a Fillable Pixel in the output depends on its shortest path distance to the various Seed Pixels in the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all "seed pixels" in the input grid. A seed pixel is any pixel whose color is *not* white (0) and *not* blue (1).
3.  Simultaneously perform a breadth-first expansion (flood fill) starting from all seed pixels.
4.  The expansion progresses into adjacent pixels that were originally white (0) or blue (1) in the input grid.
5.  Keep track of the distance from each seed pixel to the cells it expands into.
6.  For each pixel that was originally white (0) or blue (1):
    *   Determine the seed pixel(s) from which it can be reached with the minimum expansion distance.
    *   If only one seed pixel is closest, assign the color of that seed pixel to the corresponding pixel in the output grid.
    *   If multiple seed pixels of different colors are equidistant (i.e., reach the pixel in the same number of expansion steps), assign the color of the seed pixel with the lowest numerical color value (e.g., if Red(2) and Azure(8) are tied, choose Red(2)).
7.  Pixels that were originally seed pixels retain their original color in the output grid.
8.  The final state of the output grid after the expansion and tie-breaking is complete represents the transformation result.
