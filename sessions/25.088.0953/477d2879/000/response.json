The output grids contain colors present in the input, *except* for white (0) and blue (1).\n3.  **Background:** The white (0) pixels in the input are always filled with some other color in the output.\n4.  **Blue Pixels (Color 1):** The blue (1) pixels in the input seem to act as separators or boundaries initially, but they are also replaced with other colors in the output.\n5.  **Other Colors:** Non-white, non-blue pixels in the input generally retain their color and position in the output. These seem to act as \"seeds\".\n6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a type of \"flood fill\" or region expansion. The areas initially occupied by white (0) and blue (1) pixels are filled based on the colors of the nearest non-white, non-blue \"seed\" pixels. Blue pixels do not block the fill; they are filled themselves.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

A seed pixel is any pixel whose color is *not* white (0) and *not* blue (1).\n3.  Simultaneously perform a breadth-first expansion (flood fill) starting from all seed pixels.\n4.  The expansion progresses into adjacent pixels that were originally white (0) or blue (1) in the input grid.\n5.  Keep track of the distance from each seed pixel to the cells it expands into.\n6.  For each pixel that was originally white (0) or blue (1):\n    *   Determine the seed pixel(s) from which it can be reached with the minimum expansion distance.\n    *   If only one seed pixel is closest, assign the color of that seed pixel to the corresponding pixel in the output grid.\n    *   If multiple seed pixels of different colors are equidistant (i.e., reach the pixel in the same number of expansion steps), assign the color of the seed pixel with the lowest numerical color value (e.g., if Red(2) and Azure(8) are tied, choose Red(2)).\n7.  Pixels that were originally seed pixels retain their original color in the output grid.\n8.  The final state of the output grid after the expansion and tie-breaking is complete represents the transformation result."
