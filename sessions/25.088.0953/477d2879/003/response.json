Identifies 'seed' pixels (any color other than white (0) or blue (1))\n       and 'barrier' pixels (blue (1)) in the input grid.\n    2. Initializes an output grid (to store final colors), a distance grid\n       (initialized to infinity), and a queue for BFS.\n    3. Sets the distance to 0 and the color to the seed's color for all seed\n       pixel locations in the respective grids, and adds seeds to the queue.\n    4. Performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting simultaneously from all\n       seed pixels.\n    5. Expansion Rule: The BFS expands outwards layer by layer (Manhattan distance)\n       into adjacent cells. Expansion is blocked by barrier pixels (blue, 1);\n       the algorithm cannot enter or traverse barrier cells.\n    6. Update Rule: For each non-barrier cell being considered for expansion:\n        - If the expansion reaches the cell via a path shorter than any\n          previously recorded path, update the cell's distance and assign it\n          the color of the originating seed. Add the cell to the BFS queue.\n        - If the expansion reaches the cell via a path of the *same* minimum\n          distance as a previously recorded path, compare the current\n          expanding seed's color with the already recorded color. If the\n          current seed's color has a lower numerical value, update the cell's\n          assigned color (tie-breaking rule: lower color index wins). Do not\n          re-add to the queue if only the color changed due to a tie-break.\n    7. The expansion continues until the queue is empty.\n    8. The final color grid represents the output, where each non-barrier cell\n       contains the color of the closest seed pixel according to the BFS\n       expansion, barrier constraints, and tie-breaking rule. Barrier cells\n       remain unchanged in the color grid (or could be set to a default like 0,\n       although the examples show they get overwritten by the expansion).\n       *Correction*: The expected outputs show barrier cells *are* colored by the\n       expansion eventually, meaning the *input* barriers block movement, but\n       the output grid gets fully colored based on proximity to seeds around\n       the barriers.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_grid_np.shape\n\n    # Initialize distance grid with infinity and the output grid with a placeholder (-1)\n    distance_grid = np.full((height, width), float('inf'))\n    output_grid = np.full((height, width), -1, dtype=int) # Will store the final colors\n\n    # Use a deque for BFS queue\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Identify seed pixels and initialize the BFS\n    # Also identify barrier locations\n    barrier_mask = (input_grid_np == 1)\n\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            color = input_grid_np[r, c]\n            # Seed pixels are those not 0 (white) and not 1 (blue)\n            if color != 0 and color != 1:\n                distance_grid[r, c] = 0\n                output_grid[r, c] = color\n                queue.append((r, c))\n            # Initialize barrier cells in output grid as well?\n            # No, let the expansion fill them if reachable around barriers.\n            # Initialize non-seed, non-barrier cells?\n            # No, the -1 placeholder handles this.\n\n    # Define neighbors (4-directional adjacency)\n    dr = [-1, 1, 0, 0]\n    dc = [0, 0, -1, 1]\n\n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        current_dist = distance_grid[r, c]\n        current_color = output_grid[r, c] # Color comes from the winning seed\n\n        # Explore neighbors\n        for i in range(4):\n            nr, nc = r + dr[i], c + dc[i]\n\n            # Check if neighbor is within bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n\n                # *** Check if the neighbor is NOT a barrier in the INPUT grid ***\n                if not barrier_mask[nr, nc]:\n                    new_dist = current_dist + 1\n\n                    # Check if this path is shorter than any previous path\n                    if new_dist < distance_grid[nr, nc]:\n                        distance_grid[nr, nc] = new_dist\n                        output_grid[nr, nc] = current_color\n                        queue.append((nr, nc))\n                    # Check for tie-breaking condition: same distance, but lower color index\n                    elif new_dist == distance_grid[nr, nc]:\n                        # Update color only if the current seed's color is smaller\n                        if current_color < output_grid[nr, nc]:\n                            output_grid[nr, nc] = current_color\n                            # No need to re-add to queue if only tie-breaking\n\n    # Handle any cells that remained unreachable (-1) - should not happen if seeds exist\n    # and the grid isn't entirely enclosed by barriers.
