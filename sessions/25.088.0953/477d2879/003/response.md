def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by expanding colors from 'seed' pixels outwards,
    respecting 'barrier' pixels.

    1. Identifies 'seed' pixels (any color other than white (0) or blue (1))
       and 'barrier' pixels (blue (1)) in the input grid.
    2. Initializes an output grid (to store final colors), a distance grid
       (initialized to infinity), and a queue for BFS.
    3. Sets the distance to 0 and the color to the seed's color for all seed
       pixel locations in the respective grids, and adds seeds to the queue.
    4. Performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting simultaneously from all
       seed pixels.
    5. Expansion Rule: The BFS expands outwards layer by layer (Manhattan distance)
       into adjacent cells. Expansion is blocked by barrier pixels (blue, 1);
       the algorithm cannot enter or traverse barrier cells.
    6. Update Rule: For each non-barrier cell being considered for expansion:
        - If the expansion reaches the cell via a path shorter than any
          previously recorded path, update the cell's distance and assign it
          the color of the originating seed. Add the cell to the BFS queue.
        - If the expansion reaches the cell via a path of the *same* minimum
          distance as a previously recorded path, compare the current
          expanding seed's color with the already recorded color. If the
          current seed's color has a lower numerical value, update the cell's
          assigned color (tie-breaking rule: lower color index wins). Do not
          re-add to the queue if only the color changed due to a tie-break.
    7. The expansion continues until the queue is empty.
    8. The final color grid represents the output, where each non-barrier cell
       contains the color of the closest seed pixel according to the BFS
       expansion, barrier constraints, and tie-breaking rule. Barrier cells
       remain unchanged in the color grid (or could be set to a default like 0,
       although the examples show they get overwritten by the expansion).
       *Correction*: The expected outputs show barrier cells *are* colored by the
       expansion eventually, meaning the *input* barriers block movement, but
       the output grid gets fully colored based on proximity to seeds around
       the barriers.
