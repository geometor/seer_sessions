This simulates a Voronoi diagram where regions are defined \n    by the closest seed. Ties in distance are broken by choosing the seed with the \n    numerically lower color value. Input pixels with color 0 (white) or 1 (blue) \n    act as empty space and do not block the expansion.\n\n    1. Identify Seed Pixels: Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a \n       color value greater than 1 (colors 2 through 9). These are the seeds.\n    2. Initialize Grids and Queue: Create a distance grid initialized with \n       infinity, an output grid initialized with a placeholder (e.g., -1), \n       and a queue for Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n    3. Place Seeds: For each seed pixel at location (r, c) with color \n       `seed_color`, set its distance to 0, its color in the output grid to \n       `seed_color`, and add its location to the BFS queue.\n    4. Expand Colors (BFS): Perform a multi-source BFS. While the queue is not \n       empty, dequeue a location. For each valid neighbor:\n        a. Calculate the new distance (current distance + 1).\n        b. If the new distance is shorter than the recorded distance for the \n           neighbor, update the neighbor's distance and color (to the current \n           propagated color) and enqueue the neighbor.\n        c. If the new distance is equal to the recorded distance (a tie), compare \n           the currently propagated color with the neighbor's existing color. \n           If the current color is numerically smaller, update the neighbor's color.\n    5. Return Output: Once the BFS is complete, the output grid contains the \n       final colored regions.
