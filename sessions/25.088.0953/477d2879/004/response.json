            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed significantly on all training examples, indicating a fundamental flaw in the implemented logic. The core transformation appears to involve expanding regions from specific \"seed\" pixels until the entire grid is filled, akin to generating a Voronoi diagram based on Manhattan distance. The key error in the previous code was treating blue pixels (color 1) as impenetrable barriers. The analysis of expected outputs reveals that blue pixels in the input act like empty space (similar to white/0) during the expansion process; they do not block the expansion and get filled with the color of the nearest seed. The presence of color 0 (white) in the transformed outputs, while absent in the expected outputs (except potentially as an input background color that gets overwritten), further supports this: the incorrect barrier logic caused some areas to be unreachable, which were then defaulted to white.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the expansion logic:\n1.  Identify seed pixels: any pixel with color > 1.\n2.  Treat all non-seed pixels (colors 0 and 1) as empty space that can be filled.\n3.  Perform a multi-source BFS starting simultaneously from all seeds.\n4.  Use Manhattan distance to determine the \"closest\" seed.\n5.  In case of a tie in distance between two or more seeds, the seed with the lower color index wins.\n6.  Fill the entire grid based on this expansion rule.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Grid Size | Pixels Off | Pct Off | Expected Colors | Transformed Colors | Missing Colors | Extra Colors |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 13x13 | 92 / 169 | 54.44% | [2, 3, 8] | [0, 2, 3, 8] | [] | [0] |\n| 2 | 13x13 | 86 / 169 | 50.89% | [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8] | [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8] | [] | [0] |\n| 3 | 13x13 | 124 / 169 | 73.37% | [2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9] | [0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9] | [] | [0] |\n\n**Observations:**\n*   The error rate is very high (50-73%), confirming a major logic error.\n*   The transformed outputs consistently contain color 0 (white), which is absent in the expected outputs. This occurs because the faulty barrier logic made some cells unreachable, and the code defaulted them to 0. The expected outputs show the entire grid being filled by the seed colors.\n*   Apart from the extra color 0, the set of colors present in the transformed output generally matches the expected output, suggesting the seed identification was likely correct.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

These are the \"seed\" pixels.\n2.  **Prepare for Expansion**: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input. Initialize a distance grid (same dimensions) with infinity for all cells.\n3.  **Initialize Seeds**: For each seed pixel identified in step 1, set its corresponding location in the distance grid to 0 and in the output grid to its own color. Add all seed locations to a queue for a Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n4.  **Perform Multi-Source BFS**:\n    a.  While the queue is not empty, remove a location (r, c) from the front. Let its distance be `d` and its originating seed color be `color`.\n    b.  Consider its four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n    c.  For each neighbor (nr, nc) that is within the grid boundaries:\n        i.  Calculate the potential new distance: `new_dist = d + 1`.\n        ii. **Compare Distances**: If `new_dist` is less than the current distance recorded for (nr, nc) in the distance grid:\n            - Update the distance grid at (nr, nc) to `new_dist`.\n            - Update the output grid at (nr, nc) to `color`.\n            - Add (nr, nc) to the queue.\n        iii. **Handle Ties**: If `new_dist` is equal to the current distance recorded for (nr, nc):\n            - Compare `color` with the color currently assigned to (nr, nc) in the output grid.\n            - If `color` is numerically smaller than the existing color, update the output grid at (nr, nc) to `color`. (Do *not* re-add to the queue just for a tie-breaking color update).\n5.  **Final Output**: Once the queue is empty, the output grid contains the final result, where every cell is colored according to the nearest seed (using Manhattan distance and the specified tie-breaking rule). Blue (1) and white (0) cells from the input do not block the expansion and are filled like any other non-seed cell.## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempted to solve the task using a multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach, expanding colors from \"seed\" pixels outwards. However, the code fundamentally misinterpreted the role of blue (1) pixels, treating them as impenetrable barriers. The analysis of the input-output examples, particularly the expected outputs, reveals that blue pixels function merely as empty space, similar to white (0) pixels, and do not impede the color expansion. They are filled based on proximity to the nearest seed, just like the white background cells.\n\nThe high error rates (50-74%) and the presence of unexpected white (0) pixels in the transformed outputs confirm this misinterpretation. The white pixels appeared because the incorrect barrier logic made some grid areas unreachable by the BFS, causing them to retain their initial placeholder value which was later converted to 0.\n\nThe strategy moving forward is to correct the BFS implementation:\n1.  Correctly identify seed pixels as any pixel with color > 1.\n2.  Treat all non-seed pixels (colors 0 and 1) as traversable and fillable empty space.\n3.  Perform the multi-source BFS using Manhattan distance.\n4.  Implement the tie-breaking rule correctly: if a cell is equidistant from multiple seeds, assign the color of the seed with the lowest numerical value (color index).\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following metrics quantify the difference between the expected outputs and the outputs generated by the previous code:\n\n| Example | Grid Size | Total Pixels | Pixels Off | Pct Off | Expected Colors     | Transformed Colors       | Missing Colors | Extra Colors |\n| :------ | :-------- | :----------- | :--------- | :------ | :------------------ | :----------------------- | :------------- | :----------- |\n| 1       | 13x13     | 169          | 92         | 54.44%  | `[2, 3, 8]`         | `[0, 2, 3, 8]`           | `[]`           | `[0]`        |\n| 2       | 13x13     | 169          | 86         | 50.89%  | `[2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]`| `[0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]`  | `[]`           | `[0]`        |\n| 3       | 13x13     | 169          | 124        | 73.37%  | `[2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9]`| `[0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9]`  | `[]`           | `[0]`        |\n\n**Key Observations:**\n*   A significant portion of pixels (>50%) were incorrect in all examples.\n*   The transformed outputs incorrectly included color 0 (white), which was absent in the expected outputs. This is a direct result of treating blue pixels as barriers, making some areas unreachable.\n*   The set of non-zero colors present in the transformed outputs generally matched those in the expected outputs, suggesting seed identification was correct, but their distribution was wrong.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
