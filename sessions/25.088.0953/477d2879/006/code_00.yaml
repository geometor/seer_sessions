task_type: fill
grid_properties:
  size: constant between input and output
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: seed
    color: 2-9 (red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
    role: origin points for color expansion
    location: fixed positions in the input grid
  - type: wall
    color: blue (1)
    role: acts as an impenetrable barrier to color expansion
    location: fixed positions in the input grid
  - type: empty_space
    color: white (0)
    role: area to be filled by color expansion from seeds
actions:
  - name: expand_color
    actor: seed pixels
    target: empty_space pixels (white, 0)
    constraints:
      - expansion stops at grid boundaries
      - expansion stops at wall pixels (blue, 1)
      - expansion uses Manhattan distance
    mechanism: Multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting simultaneously from all seed pixels.
  - name: resolve_ties
    condition: An empty_space pixel is equidistant from two or more seeds.
    mechanism: Assign the color of the seed with the numerically smallest color value.
goal: Fill all reachable empty_space pixels with the color of the nearest seed, respecting wall barriers and the tie-breaking rule.
