            "text": "Okay, the metrics confirm the high mismatch percentages (41-55%) and show that a very large proportion of these mismatches occur adjacent to barrier cells (blue=1). This strongly reinforces the hypothesis that the barrier handling was the primary issue in the previous code. The expansion needs to be explicitly prevented from entering or passing through blue cells.\n\nThe core logic should be:\n1. Find seeds (non-white, non-blue).\n2. Find barriers (blue).\n3. Initialize distances to infinity, colors to a placeholder (like -1 or 0).\n4. Set distance=0 and color=seed_color at seed locations.\n5. Perform BFS starting from all seeds simultaneously.\n6. When exploring neighbors `(nr, nc)` from `(r, c)`:\n   *   Check if `(nr, nc)` is within bounds.\n   *   **Crucially, check if `input_grid[nr, nc]` is NOT blue (1).**\n   *   If it's a valid, non-barrier cell:\n        *   Calculate `new_dist = distance[r, c] + 1`.\n        *   If `new_dist < distance[nr, nc]`: update distance and color, add to queue.\n        *   If `new_dist == distance[nr, nc]` and `current_color < output_grid[nr, nc]`: update color (tie-break).\n\nThis revised logic correctly incorporates the barriers.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed on all training examples, producing outputs significantly different from the expected ones (41-55% pixel mismatch). The core logic implemented a simultaneous Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from 'seed' pixels (non-white, non-blue) to fill the grid, using a tie-breaking rule based on the lower color index for equidistant cells.\n\nAnalysis of the results, particularly using the metrics gathered below, reveals that the vast majority of mismatched pixels occur adjacent to the blue (1) pixels in the input grid. This strongly suggests the previous code did not correctly handle the blue pixels as barriers to the expansion process. The BFS likely propagated through or into blue cells, leading to incorrect region assignments.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is to modify the BFS algorithm to explicitly treat blue pixels as impassable barriers. The expansion from one cell to an adjacent one should only be allowed if the target cell is *not* blue.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics were gathered for each training example:\n\n"
