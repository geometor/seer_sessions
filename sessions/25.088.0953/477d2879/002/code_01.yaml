task_type: grid_transformation
input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - pixels:
      - type: background (white, 0)
      - type: barrier (blue, 1) - Impassable boundaries for color expansion.
      - type: seed (any color != 0 and != 1) - Sources for color expansion.
output_features:
  - grid: 2D array of integers, same dimensions as input.
  - pixels: Contain only colors from the input 'seed' pixels.
transformation:
  type: constrained_region_expansion (similar to Voronoi diagram with barriers)
  process: multi-source_breadth_first_search
  sources: 'seed' pixels identified in the input grid.
  expansion_rules:
    - Spread occurs outwards from all seeds simultaneously using Manhattan distance (4-way adjacency).
    - Expansion is blocked by 'barrier' pixels (blue, 1). Seeds cannot expand into or through barrier cells.
    - All non-barrier cells (including original white cells) are eventually filled with a seed color.
  tie_breaking:
    - If a cell can be reached by multiple seeds at the same minimum distance, the cell takes the color of the seed with the lowest numerical color value.
