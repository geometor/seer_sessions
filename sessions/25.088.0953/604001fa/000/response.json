The blue objects from the input are transformed into objects of different colors (green (3), yellow (4), magenta (6), or azure (8)). The orange objects from the input are removed.\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   **Blue Objects:** These are the primary data objects that undergo transformation. They retain their shape and position but change color.\n    *   **Orange Objects:** These seem to act as \"keys\" or \"markers\" that determine *how* the nearby blue objects are transformed. Each distinct orange shape appears to correspond to a specific output color. They are not present in the output.\n4.  **Relationships:** Each blue object is spatially associated with one orange object. The analysis suggests this association is based on proximity (closest distance).\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves:\n    *   Identifying pairs of associated blue and orange objects.\n    *   Determining the specific shape/pattern of the associated orange object.\n    *   Mapping the orange object's shape to a specific output color (3, 4, 6, or 8).\n    *   Replacing the blue (1) pixels of the blue object with the determined output color pixels in the output grid, maintaining the original shape and position.\n    *   Removing the orange (7) pixels (effectively replacing them with the background white (0)).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
