**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** Contains a background of white (0) pixels, distinct objects composed of blue (1) pixels, and distinct objects composed of orange (7) pixels.
2.  **Output Grid:** Contains a background of white (0) pixels. The blue objects from the input are transformed into objects of different colors (green (3), yellow (4), magenta (6), or azure (8)). The orange objects from the input are removed.
3.  **Objects:**
    *   **Blue Objects:** These are the primary data objects that undergo transformation. They retain their shape and position but change color.
    *   **Orange Objects:** These seem to act as "keys" or "markers" that determine *how* the nearby blue objects are transformed. Each distinct orange shape appears to correspond to a specific output color. They are not present in the output.
4.  **Relationships:** Each blue object is spatially associated with one orange object. The analysis suggests this association is based on proximity (closest distance).
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves:
    *   Identifying pairs of associated blue and orange objects.
    *   Determining the specific shape/pattern of the associated orange object.
    *   Mapping the orange object's shape to a specific output color (3, 4, 6, or 8).
    *   Replacing the blue (1) pixels of the blue object with the determined output color pixels in the output grid, maintaining the original shape and position.
    *   Removing the orange (7) pixels (effectively replacing them with the background white (0)).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Recolor blue objects based on the shape of the spatially closest orange object, then remove the orange objects."
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: data_object
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - shape: variable (e.g., L-shape, T-shape)
      - undergoes_transformation: true (color change)
      - persists: shape and position are preserved
  - type: key_object
    color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - shape: variable (specific shapes act as keys)
      - determines_transformation: dictates the output color for associated blue objects
      - removed_in_output: true

    metric: minimum_manhattan_distance
transformation:
  - step: 1
    action: identify_objects
    inputs:
      - input grid
    outputs:
      - list of blue (1) objects (coordinates and shape)
      - list of orange (7) objects (coordinates and shape)
  - step: 2
    action: associate_objects
    inputs:
      - list of blue objects
      - list of orange objects
    outputs:
      - pairs of (blue_object, closest_orange_object)
    logic: "For each blue object, find the orange object with the minimum Manhattan distance between any pixel of the blue object and any pixel of the orange object."
  - step: 3
    action: determine_output_color
    inputs:
      - associated pairs from step 2
    outputs:
      - mapping of {blue_object: output_color}
    logic: |
      Based on the specific shape pattern of the 'closest_orange_object' in each pair, determine the output color using a predefined mapping:
      - Orange shape [[7], [7, 7]] -> Green (3)
      - Orange shape [[7, 7], [7]] -> Magenta (6)
      - Orange shape [[7, 7], [0, 7]] -> Yellow (4)
      - Orange shape [[7, 7], [7, 0]] -> Azure (8)
      (Note: Shapes are defined relative to their top-left bounding box corner)
  - step: 4
    action: generate_output_grid
    inputs:
      - input grid dimensions
      - mapping from step 3
      - list of blue objects (coordinates)
    outputs:
      - output grid
    logic: |
      Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with white (0).
      For each blue object, fill its corresponding pixel coordinates in the output grid with the determined 'output_color'.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but with all pixels set to the background color (white, 0).
2.  Find all separate, contiguous groups of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. Let's call these the "blue objects". Record the coordinates of the pixels belonging to each blue object.
3.  Find all separate, contiguous groups of orange (7) pixels in the input grid. Let's call these the "orange objects". For each orange object, record its unique shape pattern (relative arrangement of its pixels) and the coordinates of its pixels.
4.  Establish a mapping between specific orange object shapes and target output colors:
    *   Shape `[[7], [7, 7]]` maps to Green (3).
    *   Shape `[[7, 7], [7]]` maps to Magenta (6).
    *   Shape `[[7, 7], [0, 7]]` maps to Yellow (4).
    *   Shape `[[7, 7], [7, 0]]` maps to Azure (8).
5.  For each identified blue object:
    a.  Calculate the shortest Manhattan distance from any pixel of this blue object to any pixel of *every* orange object.
    b.  Identify the orange object that has the minimum calculated distance to this blue object. This is the "associated orange object".
    c.  Determine the shape pattern of this associated orange object.
    d.  Look up the target output color corresponding to this shape pattern using the mapping from step 4.
    e.  For all the pixel coordinates originally belonging to this blue object, set the corresponding pixels in the output grid to the determined target output color.
6.  Return the final output grid.
