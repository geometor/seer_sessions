            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input:** The input grids contain a white background (0) and several scattered, single, non-white pixels. Each example seems to have exactly five non-white pixels. One of these pixels is always red (2).\n2.  **Output:** The output grids are also mostly white but feature lines forming a frame and a central cross structure. The colors of the frame lines correspond to the colors of the non-red pixels in the input. The central cross structure involves the color red (2) and gray (5).\n3.  **Relationship:** The positions and colors of the input pixels dictate the position, extent, and colors of the lines in the output.\n\n**Detailed Observations:**\n\n*   **Bounding Box:** The non-white pixels in the input define an implicit bounding box. Let `min_row`, `max_row`, `min_col`, `max_col` be the minimum/maximum row and column indices containing any non-white pixel.\n*   **Frame:**\n    *   A horizontal line is drawn at `min_row`, spanning from `min_col` to `max_col`. Its color is the color of the input pixel located at `min_row`.\n    *   A horizontal line is drawn at `max_row`, spanning from `min_col` to `max_col`. Its color is the color of the input pixel located at `max_row`.\n    *   A vertical line is drawn at `min_col`, spanning from `min_row + 1` to `max_row - 1`. Its color is the color of the input pixel located at `min_col`.\n    *   A vertical line is drawn at `max_col`, spanning from `min_row + 1` to `max_row - 1`. Its color is the color of the input pixel located at `max_col`.\n    *   It appears the input pixels defining the frame boundaries are never the red (2) pixel. The red pixel is always located *inside* the bounding box defined by the other four pixels.\n*   **Central Cross:**\n    *   The red (2) pixel in the input seems to be the 'center' or 'target' pixel. Let its coordinates be `(r_c, c_c)`.\n    *   A gray (5) cross is drawn centered at `(r_c, c_c)`.\n    *   The vertical arm of the gray cross is drawn at column `c_c`, spanning from `min_row + 1` to `max_row - 1`.\n    *   The horizontal arm of the gray cross is drawn at row `r_c`, spanning from `min_col + 1` to `max_col - 1`.\n    *   The intersection point `(r_c, c_c)` is gray (5). The original red pixel is effectively replaced by the center of the gray cross.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
