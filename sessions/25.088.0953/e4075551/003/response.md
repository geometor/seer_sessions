"""
Identifies five non-white pixels in the input grid: one red (2) and four others.
These five pixels define a bounding box.
Initializes an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with white (0).
Draws an outer frame on the output grid using the colors of the four non-red pixels, corresponding to the boundaries (top, bottom, left, right) they define relative to the bounding box.
Draws a cross centered at the original location of the red pixel. The cross arms are gray (5). The cross extends vertically from the row below the top frame line to the row above the bottom frame line, and horizontally from the column right of the left frame line to the column left of the right frame line.
The central pixel of the cross (at the original red pixel's location) is colored red (2).
