Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input:** The input grids contain a white background (0) and several scattered, single, non-white pixels. Each example seems to have exactly five non-white pixels. One of these pixels is always red (2).
2.  **Output:** The output grids are also mostly white but feature lines forming a frame and a central cross structure. The colors of the frame lines correspond to the colors of the non-red pixels in the input. The central cross structure involves the color red (2) and gray (5).
3.  **Relationship:** The positions and colors of the input pixels dictate the position, extent, and colors of the lines in the output.

**Detailed Observations:**

*   **Bounding Box:** The non-white pixels in the input define an implicit bounding box. Let `min_row`, `max_row`, `min_col`, `max_col` be the minimum/maximum row and column indices containing any non-white pixel.
*   **Frame:**
    *   A horizontal line is drawn at `min_row`, spanning from `min_col` to `max_col`. Its color is the color of the input pixel located at `min_row`.
    *   A horizontal line is drawn at `max_row`, spanning from `min_col` to `max_col`. Its color is the color of the input pixel located at `max_row`.
    *   A vertical line is drawn at `min_col`, spanning from `min_row + 1` to `max_row - 1`. Its color is the color of the input pixel located at `min_col`.
    *   A vertical line is drawn at `max_col`, spanning from `min_row + 1` to `max_row - 1`. Its color is the color of the input pixel located at `max_col`.
    *   It appears the input pixels defining the frame boundaries are never the red (2) pixel. The red pixel is always located *inside* the bounding box defined by the other four pixels.
*   **Central Cross:**
    *   The red (2) pixel in the input seems to be the 'center' or 'target' pixel. Let its coordinates be `(r_c, c_c)`.
    *   A gray (5) cross is drawn centered at `(r_c, c_c)`.
    *   The vertical arm of the gray cross is drawn at column `c_c`, spanning from `min_row + 1` to `max_row - 1`.
    *   The horizontal arm of the gray cross is drawn at row `r_c`, spanning from `min_col + 1` to `max_col - 1`.
    *   The intersection point `(r_c, c_c)` is gray (5). The original red pixel is effectively replaced by the center of the gray cross.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - type: 2D array
    - cells: integer values 0-9 (colors)
    - background_color: white (0)

Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-white
      - location: (row, column)
      - count_per_input: 5 (based on examples)
    subtypes:
      - Central_Pixel:
          properties:
            - color: red (2)
            - role: Defines the center of the gray cross
      - Boundary_Pixels:
          properties:
            - color: any non-white, non-red color
            - role: Define the bounding box and the colors/locations of the outer frame lines
            - count: 4 (based on examples)

Relationships:
  - Bounding_Box: Determined by the min/max row/column of all non-white pixels.
  - Frame_Lines:
    - Horizontal Top: At min_row, color from pixel at min_row, spans min_col to max_col.
    - Horizontal Bottom: At max_row, color from pixel at max_row, spans min_col to max_col.
    - Vertical Left: At min_col, color from pixel at min_col, spans min_row+1 to max_row-1.
    - Vertical Right: At max_col, color from pixel at max_col, spans min_row+1 to max_row-1.
  - Central_Cross:
    - Color: gray (5)
    - Center: location of the input red (2) pixel (r_c, c_c)
    - Vertical Arm: At column c_c, spans min_row+1 to max_row-1.
    - Horizontal Arm: At row r_c, spans min_col+1 to max_col-1.

Transformation:
  - Identify the single red (2) pixel and the other four non-white pixels.
  - Calculate the bounding box (min/max row/col) using all five pixels.
  - Draw the outer frame lines using the colors and boundary locations defined by the four non-red pixels.
  - Draw the gray (5) cross centered at the red pixel's original location, extending vertically between the inner edges of the horizontal frame lines and horizontally between the inner edges of the vertical frame lines.
  - The final output grid contains the white background, the colored frame, and the gray cross.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find the coordinates `(r_c, c_c)` of the single red (2) pixel in the input.
3.  Find the coordinates and colors of the other four non-white pixels.
4.  Determine the minimum row (`min_row`), maximum row (`max_row`), minimum column (`min_col`), and maximum column (`max_col`) occupied by *any* of the five non-white pixels.
5.  Identify the non-red pixel located at `min_row`. Let its color be `color_top`. Draw a horizontal line in the output grid at `min_row` from `min_col` to `max_col` using `color_top`.
6.  Identify the non-red pixel located at `max_row`. Let its color be `color_bottom`. Draw a horizontal line in the output grid at `max_row` from `min_col` to `max_col` using `color_bottom`.
7.  Identify the non-red pixel located at `min_col`. Let its color be `color_left`. Draw a vertical line in the output grid at `min_col` from `min_row + 1` to `max_row - 1` using `color_left`.
8.  Identify the non-red pixel located at `max_col`. Let its color be `color_right`. Draw a vertical line in the output grid at `max_col` from `min_row + 1` to `max_row - 1` using `color_right`.
9.  Draw the central gray (5) cross:
    a.  Draw a vertical line segment with color gray (5) at column `c_c`, starting from row `min_row + 1` and ending at row `max_row - 1`.
    b.  Draw a horizontal line segment with color gray (5) at row `r_c`, starting from column `min_col + 1` and ending at column `max_col - 1`.
10. Ensure the original five input pixels are overwritten by the drawn lines/cross where applicable (this should happen naturally if drawing operations overwrite existing pixels). Return the modified output grid.
