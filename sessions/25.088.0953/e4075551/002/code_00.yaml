task_description: "Draw a colored frame and a central cross based on the positions and colors of five specific input pixels."

input_features:
  - object: Input Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9)
      - size: variable (up to 30x30)
      - content: Mostly white (0) with exactly 5 non-white pixels.
  - object: Key Pixels
    properties:
      - count: 5
      - distribution: 1 red pixel (color 2), 4 other distinct non-white pixels.
      - role: Define frame boundaries, frame colors, and cross center.

derived_features:
  - object: Bounding Box
    properties:
      - definition: Smallest rectangle enclosing all 5 key pixels.
      - coordinates: min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col derived from key pixel locations.
  - object: Frame Colors
    properties:
      - top_color: Color of the key pixel located on the min_row of the bounding box.
      - bottom_color: Color of the key pixel located on the max_row.
      - left_color: Color of the key pixel located on the min_col.
      - right_color: Color of the key pixel located on the max_col.
      - note: A single pixel might define multiple boundaries/colors if it's at a corner.
  - object: Cross Center
    properties:
      - location: Coordinates (row, col) of the input red pixel.

actions:
  - action: Initialize Output Grid
    parameters:
      - size: Same as input grid.
      - initial_color: White (0).
  - action: Draw Frame
    parameters:
      - top_edge: Draw line from (min_row, min_col) to (min_row, max_col) using top_color.
      - bottom_edge: Draw line from (max_row, min_col) to (max_row, max_col) using bottom_color.
      - left_edge: Draw line from (min_row + 1, min_col) to (max_row - 1, min_col) using left_color.
      - right_edge: Draw line from (min_row + 1, max_col) to (max_row - 1, max_col) using right_color.
  - action: Draw Cross
    parameters:
      - center: Coordinates (r_c, c_c) of the original red pixel.
      - vertical_arm: Draw line from (min_row + 1, c_c) to (max_row - 1, c_c) using gray (5).
      - horizontal_arm: Draw line from (r_c, min_col + 1) to (r_c, max_col - 1) using gray (5).
      - center_pixel: Ensure the pixel at (r_c, c_c) retains the red color (2). Overwrite if previously changed by frame or cross drawing.

output_features:
  - object: Output Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9)
      - size: Same as input grid.
      - content: White background, colored frame, and a central cross. The cross is gray (5), except for the center pixel which is red (2) at the original red pixel's location.
