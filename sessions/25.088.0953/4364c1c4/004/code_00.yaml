task_description: Identifies vertically aligned pairs of objects and shifts them horizontally.
grid_properties:
  background_color: Most frequent color in the input grid.
object_definition: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-background color (using 4-connectivity).
object_properties_used:
  - color
  - pixels
  - top_row (minimum row index)
  - leftmost_col (minimum column index)
  - bottom_row (maximum row index)
transformation_rule:
  condition: Find pairs of distinct objects (ObjA, ObjB) such that ObjA.leftmost_col == ObjB.leftmost_col.
  pairing: For objects sharing the same leftmost column, identify the 'upper' object (smaller top_row) and the 'lower' object (larger top_row). There must be exactly two objects sharing that specific leftmost column for the transformation to apply to them.
  action:
    - Translate the 'upper' object by (delta_row=0, delta_col=-1) (one step left).
    - Translate the 'lower' object by (delta_row=0, delta_col=+1) (one step right).
  unaffected_objects: Objects that do not belong to such a pair of two objects sharing the same leftmost column remain in their original positions.
output_grid:
  construction: Start with a grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color. Draw the pixels of the transformed (shifted or stationary) objects onto this grid. Ensure shifted pixels stay within grid boundaries.
