Identifies pairs of distinct objects that are vertically aligned based on sharing the same leftmost column coordinate. If exactly two objects share the same leftmost column, the one with the smaller top row index (upper object) is shifted one column left, and the one with the larger top row index (lower object) is shifted one column right. Objects not part of such a pair remain stationary.
