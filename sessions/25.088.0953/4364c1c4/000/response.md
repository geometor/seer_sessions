**Perception**

1.  **Background Preservation:** The background color of the grid remains unchanged in the output.
2.  **Object Identification:** Each input grid contains multiple distinct "objects," defined as contiguous areas of the same non-background color.
3.  **Object Preservation:** The shapes and colors of these objects are preserved from input to output.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a horizontal shift (translation) applied to each object. The amount and direction of the shift vary between objects.
5.  **Shift Determination:** The shift applied to an object seems to depend on which other objects share the same leftmost column index. Specifically, when two objects start in the same column, the one that is vertically higher shifts left, and the one that is vertically lower shifts right.
6.  **Shift Magnitude:** The magnitude of the shifts appears to be mostly (-1 left, +2 right), except in one specific case (Example 1, objects Magenta and Green) where it is (-1 left, +1 right).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Apply horizontal shifts to distinct objects based on their leftmost column and relative vertical position.

definitions:
  background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid.
  object: A contiguous block of pixels of the same color, different from the background color.
  leftmost_column(obj): The minimum column index containing any pixel of the object 'obj'.
  top_row(obj): The minimum row index containing any pixel of the object 'obj'.

transformation_steps:
  - step: Identify the background_color.
  - step: Identify all distinct objects in the input grid.
  - step: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background_color.
  - step: Group objects by their leftmost_column index.
  - step: For each group of objects sharing the same leftmost_column 'c':
      - condition: If exactly two objects (obj1, obj2) share column 'c'.
          - action: Determine which object is higher (obj_upper) and which is lower (obj_lower) based on their top_row index (lower index means higher).
          - action: Determine the shift pair (shift_left, shift_right).
              - condition: If the colors of {obj1, obj2} are {Magenta (6), Green (3)}.
                  - set: shift_pair = (-1, +1)
              - condition: Otherwise.
                  - set: shift_pair = (-1, +2)
          - action: Assign shift_left to obj_upper.
          - action: Assign shift_right to obj_lower.
      - condition: If only one object starts in column 'c'. (This case does not appear in the examples, assume shift is 0).
          - action: Assign shift = 0 to the object.
      - condition: If more than two objects start in column 'c'. (This case does not appear in the examples, rule is undefined).
  - step: For each object in the input:
      - action: Determine its calculated horizontal shift.
      - action: Copy the object's pixels to the output grid, translating them horizontally by the determined shift amount while keeping the vertical position the same. Handle boundary conditions (pixels shifting off-grid are lost).

examples_analysis:
  - example: train_1
    background: Azure (8)
    objects: [Magenta (6), Green (3)]
    leftmost_columns: {2: [Magenta, Green]}
    vertical_order: Magenta (top_row=1) is above Green (top_row=5)
    colors: {Magenta (6), Green (3)}
    shift_rule: Special case (-1, +1)
    shifts: {Magenta: -1, Green: +1}
    result: Matches output.
  - example: train_2
    background: Blue (1)
    objects: [Yellow (4), Red (2)]
    leftmost_columns: {2: [Yellow, Red]}
    vertical_order: Yellow (top_row=2) is above Red (top_row=6)
    colors: {Yellow (4), Red (2)}
    shift_rule: Default case (-1, +2)
    shifts: {Yellow: -1, Red: +2}
    result: Matches output.
  - example: train_3
    background: Green (3)
    objects: [Red (2), Orange (7), Azure (8), Magenta (6)]
    leftmost_columns: {1: [Azure, Magenta], 7: [Red, Orange]}
    group_1:
      vertical_order: Azure (top_row=5) is above Magenta (top_row=10)
      colors: {Azure (8), Magenta (6)}
      shift_rule: Default case (-1, +2)
      shifts: {Azure: -1, Magenta: +2}
    group_2:
      vertical_order: Red (top_row=2) is above Orange (top_row=3)
      colors: {Red (2), Orange (7)}
      shift_rule: Default case (-1, +2)
      shifts: {Red: -1, Orange: +2}
    result: Matches output.

assumptions:
  - Objects do not overlap in the input.
  - Exactly zero, one, or two objects will have the same leftmost column index. The case of >2 is not handled.
  - Objects are solid blocks; the transformation applies to the whole object based on its leftmost column.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid's background color and dimensions.
2.  Identify all distinct colored objects (contiguous non-background pixels) in the input grid.
3.  For each object, determine its color, its set of pixel coordinates, its top-most row index, and its left-most column index.
4.  Group the objects based on their left-most column index.
5.  Create a mapping to store the calculated horizontal shift for each object, initially setting all shifts to 0.
6.  Iterate through the groups of objects that share a common left-most column index.
7.  If a group contains exactly two objects, `ObjectA` and `ObjectB`:
    a.  Determine which object is vertically higher (e.g., `ObjectUpper`) and which is lower (`ObjectLower`) by comparing their top-most row indices.
    b.  Check if the colors of the two objects are Magenta (6) and Green (3) (in any order).
    c.  If the colors are Magenta and Green, assign a horizontal shift of -1 to `ObjectUpper` and +1 to `ObjectLower`.
    d.  Otherwise (for any other pair of colors), assign a horizontal shift of -1 to `ObjectUpper` and +2 to `ObjectLower`.
    e.  Store these calculated shifts in the mapping for `ObjectA` and `ObjectB`.
8.  Iterate through all identified objects again. For each object:
    a.  Retrieve its calculated horizontal shift from the mapping (it will be 0 if the object was not part of a pair sharing a leftmost column, or the value assigned in step 7).
    b.  For every pixel belonging to this object at coordinate (row, col) in the input grid, calculate the new column coordinate `new_col = col + shift`.
    c.  If the `new_col` is within the grid's horizontal boundaries, set the pixel at (`row`, `new_col`) in the output grid to the object's color.
9.  Return the final output grid.
