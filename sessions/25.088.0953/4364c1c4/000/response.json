The amount and direction of the shift vary between objects.\n5.  **Shift Determination:** The shift applied to an object seems to depend on which other objects share the same leftmost column index. Specifically, when two objects start in the same column, the one that is vertically higher shifts left, and the one that is vertically lower shifts right.\n6.  **Shift Magnitude:** The magnitude of the shifts appears to be mostly (-1 left, +2 right), except in one specific case (Example 1, objects Magenta and Green) where it is (-1 left, +1 right).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify all distinct colored objects (contiguous non-background pixels) in the input grid.\n3.  For each object, determine its color, its set of pixel coordinates, its top-most row index, and its left-most column index.\n4.  Group the objects based on their left-most column index.\n5.  Create a mapping to store the calculated horizontal shift for each object, initially setting all shifts to 0.\n6.  Iterate through the groups of objects that share a common left-most column index.\n7.  If a group contains exactly two objects, `ObjectA` and `ObjectB`:\n    a.  Determine which object is vertically higher (e.g., `ObjectUpper`) and which is lower (`ObjectLower`) by comparing their top-most row indices.\n    b.  Check if the colors of the two objects are Magenta (6) and Green (3) (in any order).\n    c.  If the colors are Magenta and Green, assign a horizontal shift of -1 to `ObjectUpper` and +1 to `ObjectLower`.\n    d.  Otherwise (for any other pair of colors), assign a horizontal shift of -1 to `ObjectUpper` and +2 to `ObjectLower`.\n    e.  Store these calculated shifts in the mapping for `ObjectA` and `ObjectB`.\n8.  Iterate through all identified objects again. For each object:\n    a.  Retrieve its calculated horizontal shift from the mapping (it will be 0 if the object was not part of a pair sharing a leftmost column, or the value assigned in step 7).\n    b.  For every pixel belonging to this object at coordinate (row, col) in the input grid, calculate the new column coordinate `new_col = col + shift`.\n    c.  If the `new_col` is within the grid's horizontal boundaries, set the pixel at (`row`, `new_col`) in the output grid to the object's color.\n9.  Return the final output grid."
