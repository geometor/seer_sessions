task_description: Apply horizontal shifts to distinct objects based on their leftmost column and relative vertical position.

definitions:
  background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid.
  object: A contiguous block of pixels of the same color, different from the background color.
  leftmost_column(obj): The minimum column index containing any pixel of the object 'obj'.
  top_row(obj): The minimum row index containing any pixel of the object 'obj'.

transformation_steps:
  - step: Identify the background_color.
  - step: Identify all distinct objects in the input grid.
  - step: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background_color.
  - step: Group objects by their leftmost_column index.
  - step: For each group of objects sharing the same leftmost_column 'c':
      - condition: If exactly two objects (obj1, obj2) share column 'c'.
          - action: Determine which object is higher (obj_upper) and which is lower (obj_lower) based on their top_row index (lower index means higher).
          - action: Determine the shift pair (shift_left, shift_right).
              - condition: If the colors of {obj1, obj2} are {Magenta (6), Green (3)}.
                  - set: shift_pair = (-1, +1)
              - condition: Otherwise.
                  - set: shift_pair = (-1, +2)
          - action: Assign shift_left to obj_upper.
          - action: Assign shift_right to obj_lower.
      - condition: If only one object starts in column 'c'. (This case does not appear in the examples, assume shift is 0).
          - action: Assign shift = 0 to the object.
      - condition: If more than two objects start in column 'c'. (This case does not appear in the examples, rule is undefined).
  - step: For each object in the input:
      - action: Determine its calculated horizontal shift.
      - action: Copy the object's pixels to the output grid, translating them horizontally by the determined shift amount while keeping the vertical position the same. Handle boundary conditions (pixels shifting off-grid are lost).

examples_analysis:
  - example: train_1
    background: Azure (8)
    objects: [Magenta (6), Green (3)]
    leftmost_columns: {2: [Magenta, Green]}
    vertical_order: Magenta (top_row=1) is above Green (top_row=5)
    colors: {Magenta (6), Green (3)}
    shift_rule: Special case (-1, +1)
    shifts: {Magenta: -1, Green: +1}
    result: Matches output.
  - example: train_2
    background: Blue (1)
    objects: [Yellow (4), Red (2)]
    leftmost_columns: {2: [Yellow, Red]}
    vertical_order: Yellow (top_row=2) is above Red (top_row=6)
    colors: {Yellow (4), Red (2)}
    shift_rule: Default case (-1, +2)
    shifts: {Yellow: -1, Red: +2}
    result: Matches output.
  - example: train_3
    background: Green (3)
    objects: [Red (2), Orange (7), Azure (8), Magenta (6)]
    leftmost_columns: {1: [Azure, Magenta], 7: [Red, Orange]}
    group_1:
      vertical_order: Azure (top_row=5) is above Magenta (top_row=10)
      colors: {Azure (8), Magenta (6)}
      shift_rule: Default case (-1, +2)
      shifts: {Azure: -1, Magenta: +2}
    group_2:
      vertical_order: Red (top_row=2) is above Orange (top_row=3)
      colors: {Red (2), Orange (7)}
      shift_rule: Default case (-1, +2)
      shifts: {Red: -1, Orange: +2}
    result: Matches output.

assumptions:
  - Objects do not overlap in the input.
  - Exactly zero, one, or two objects will have the same leftmost column index. The case of >2 is not handled.
  - Objects are solid blocks; the transformation applies to the whole object based on its leftmost column.
