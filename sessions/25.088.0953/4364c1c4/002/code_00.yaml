task_description: |
  Identify pairs of distinct objects that are vertically aligned, meaning they share the same leftmost column coordinate. For each such pair, shift the object that is higher up (smaller top row index) one step to the left, and shift the object that is lower down (larger top row index) one step to the right. Objects not part of such a pair remain stationary.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: Determined as the most frequent color in the input grid.
  - objects: Contiguous areas of non-background colors. Each object has properties like color, set of pixel coordinates, topmost row index, and leftmost column index.

object_pairing:
  condition: Two distinct objects share the same leftmost column index.
  identification:
    - group objects by their `leftmost_col`.
    - process groups containing exactly two objects.
  ordering: Within a pair, identify the 'upper' object (smaller `top_row`) and the 'lower' object (larger `top_row`).

transformation:
  - type: Horizontal shift (translation along the column axis).
  - rule:
    - Apply to objects identified in `object_pairing`.
    - Upper object shift: -1 (one column left).
    - Lower object shift: +1 (one column right).
  - boundary_handling: Pixels shifted outside the grid boundaries are discarded.
  - output_grid: Start with a grid filled with the background color, then draw the shifted objects. Unpaired objects are drawn in their original positions (effectively a shift of 0).

examples_summary:
  - example: 1
    background: Azure (8)
    pairs:
      - left_col: 2
        upper: Magenta (6), top=1
        lower: Green (3), top=5
    shifts: Magenta (-1), Green (+1)
  - example: 2
    background: Blue (1)
    pairs:
      - left_col: 2
        upper: Yellow (4), top=2
        lower: Red (2), top=6
    shifts: Yellow (-1), Red (+1) # Original code incorrectly applied +2 to Red
  - example: 3
    background: Green (3)
    pairs:
      - left_col: 1
        upper: Azure (8), top=5
        lower: Magenta (6), top=10
      - left_col: 7
        upper: Red (2), top=2
        lower: Orange (7), top=3
    shifts: Azure (-1), Magenta (+1), Red (-1), Orange (+1) # Original code incorrectly applied +2 to Magenta and Orange
