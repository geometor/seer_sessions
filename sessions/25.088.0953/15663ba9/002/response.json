            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided Python code attempts to solve the task by identifying the primary non-black color in the input grid and then modifying pixels of that color based on the count of their orthogonal neighbors of the same color. Specifically, it changes pixels with exactly 2 such neighbors to yellow (4) and pixels with exactly 3 such neighbors to red (2).\n\nThe results show that this approach fails on all three training examples. The transformed outputs correctly identify the primary color and apply changes, but the resulting patterns significantly differ from the expected outputs. Key issues observed:\n\n1.  **Over-transformation:** Many more pixels are changed in the transformed output than in the expected output. Pixels that should remain the primary color are being changed, primarily to yellow.\n2.  **Incorrect Transformation:** Pixels are being changed to yellow (4) when they should either remain the primary color or change to red (2). The red (2) transformation seems particularly problematic, either not triggering correctly or being overshadowed by incorrect yellow transformations.\n3.  **Missing Nuance:** The simple rule of counting orthogonal neighbors seems insufficient. There might be additional conditions related to the *configuration* of neighbors (e.g., corners vs. straight lines), the pixel's position within the larger shape, or other local patterns.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution**\n\n1.  **Detailed Analysis:** Perform a pixel-by-pixel analysis for each example, comparing the input, expected output, and the code's transformed output.\n2.  **Identify Correct Cases:** Find pixels where the current code *does* produce the correct output color. Analyze their neighbor counts and configurations.\n3.  **Identify Incorrect Cases:** Find pixels where the code produces the wrong output color. Analyze their neighbor counts, configurations, and the expected color.\n4.  **Refine Rules:** Based on the analysis, refine the conditions for changing a pixel's color. Focus on distinguishing between cases that result in yellow (4), red (2), or no change. Pay close attention to pixels that have 2 or 3 neighbors but *do not* change color in the expected output.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n"
