"""
Find all occurrences of a horizontal pattern `[X, 4, X]` (where X is any color other than black (0) or yellow(4)) 
such that the pixel directly above the central yellow pixel (4) also has the color X. 
Collect all such colors X found. Count the frequency of each collected color X. 
The output is a 1x1 grid containing the color X that has the highest frequency. 
If there is a tie for the highest frequency, choose the color X with the smallest numerical value.
If no such patterns are found, output a 1x1 grid with black (0).
