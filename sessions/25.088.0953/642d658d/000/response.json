            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the examples provided for this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grids:** The input grids are relatively large and contain a variety of colors, seemingly randomly distributed. The dominant color varies between examples (gray in 1, red in 2, gray in 3), suggesting the background color isn't the primary focus.\n2.  **Output Grids:** The outputs are consistently single pixels (1x1 grids) representing a single color value.\n3.  **Key Pattern:** A recurring motif across all input examples is the horizontal sequence of pixels: green (3), yellow (4), green (3).\n4.  **Relationship:** In each input grid, observing the pixel directly *above* the central yellow (4) pixel in the `3 4 3` sequence reveals a specific color.\n    *   In `train_1`, the pixel above the `4` in `3 4 3` is red (2). The output is `2`.\n    *   In `train_2`, there are two instances of `3 4 3`. In both cases, the pixel above the `4` is green (3). The output is `3`.\n    *   In `train_3`, the pixel above the `4` in `3 4 3` is azure (8). The output is `8`.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The task appears to involve locating this specific `3 4 3` pattern within the input grid and extracting the color value of the pixel situated directly above the central yellow (4) pixel. This extracted color value becomes the output. If multiple instances of the pattern exist, they seem to consistently yield the same result based on the pixel above the '4'.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

For each identified sequence, locate the pixel positioned directly above the central yellow (4) pixel (i.e., at the same column index but one row index less).\n4.  Extract the color value of this pixel located above the yellow (4).\n5.  The extracted color value is the result. Construct a 1x1 output grid containing only this color value. (Assumption: all occurrences of the pattern will yield the same color above the central yellow pixel, as seen in the examples)."
