task_description: |
  Identify the single non-white contiguous block of pixels (object) whose bounding box has the largest area. If multiple objects' bounding boxes share the same maximum area, select the object among them that has the smallest color index. The output is a 3x3 grid filled entirely with the selected object's color. If no non-white objects are present, the output is a 3x3 white grid.
