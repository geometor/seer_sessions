            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code successfully identifies contiguous blocks and determines if they are solid squares based on the logic developed from the first example. It correctly solved the first example. However, it failed on the second and third examples, specifically choosing the incorrect color for the output grid.\n\nThe core logic seems correct in identifying solid squares and finding the maximum size. The discrepancy arises in the tie-breaking rule when multiple solid squares share the maximum size. The initial assumption was to choose the square with the *minimum* color index among the largest squares. The failures in examples 2 and 3 suggest this tie-breaking rule is incorrect.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-examine the relationship between input and output in all three examples.\n2.  Gather detailed metrics about the solid squares found in each input, focusing on their sizes and colors, especially those with the maximum size.\n3.  Identify the correct tie-breaking criterion that holds true for all examples. Based on initial analysis, the rule might be selecting the *maximum* color index among the squares with the maximum side length.\n4.  Update the natural language program to reflect the refined rule.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nWe will use code execution to find all solid squares, their sizes, and colors for each example, focusing on those with the maximum size.\n\n"

            "text": "**Analysis of Metrics:**\n\nThe code execution reveals significant discrepancies between the previous assumptions and the actual solid squares found:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Found one largest square: size 5, color 4 (Yellow). Expected output color 4. The initial code worked because there was only one largest square. Both \"min color\" and \"max color\" tie-breakers would yield 4.\n*   **Example 2:** Found one largest square: size 2, color 1 (Blue). Expected output color 3 (Green). The code output was 1 (Blue). This contradicts *both* the initial analysis (which assumed larger squares existed) and the \"max color index\" hypothesis. The largest actual solid square is 2x2 Blue. Why is the output Green (3)? There must be Green squares, but they are smaller (e.g., 1x1). This suggests the rule isn't just about the *largest* square.\n*   **Example 3:** Found many largest squares: size 1 (i.e., individual pixels). Colors are 2 (Red), 3 (Green), and 9 (Maroon). Expected output color 8 (Azure). The code output was 2 (Red - using the \"min color\" tie-breaker). The \"max color\" tie-breaker would yield 9 (Maroon). Neither matches the expected 8 (Azure). Again, the largest squares (1x1) don't determine the output color. There is an 8x8 Azure block, but the `is_solid_square` function determined it wasn't solid (likely due to internal white pixels or imperfections).\n\n**Revised Assessment:**\n\nThe core issue lies in the definition or identification of the relevant \"object\". The concept of a \"solid square\" as implemented (perfectly filled rectangle of a single color) is likely too strict or incorrect for this task.\n\nLet's reconsider the examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input has a large 5x5 yellow (4) area that *is* a solid square. Output is yellow (4).\n*   **Example 2:** Input has a large 5x5 green (3) area that is *almost* a square (it has two internal white pixels). Input also has a 5x5 gray (5) area that is solid. Input also has a 4x4 maroon (9) area that is solid. Input also has a 2x2 blue (1) area that is solid. Output is green (3). The green object is the *target*, even if not perfectly solid by the previous definition. It's the largest *potential* square area dominated by a single color.\n*   **Example 3:** Input has a large 8x8 azure (8) area that is *almost* a square (it has internal white pixels and one green pixel). Input has a 7x7 red (2) area that is solid. Input has a 4x4 yellow (4) area that is solid. Input has a 7x4 magenta (6) block. Output is azure (8). The azure object is the target.\n\n**New Hypothesis:** The task focuses on finding the largest *bounding box* region in the grid that is predominantly filled with a single non-white color. \"Predominantly\" might mean the color occupies the most cells within that bounding box compared to any other color. The tie-breaker might still involve color index or perhaps the density of the color within its bounding box.\n\nLet's refine the rule based on the \"largest near-square object\":\n1.  Identify all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.\n2.  For each block, determine its bounding box.\n3.  Calculate the area of the bounding box (height * width).\n4.  Find the maximum bounding box area among all blocks.\n5.  Identify all blocks whose bounding box has this maximum area.\n6.  Among these blocks, select the one whose color has the *highest* numerical value (color index).\n7.  Fill the 3x3 output grid with this selected color.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the examples with this new hypothesis:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Yellow (4) block is 5x5, Area=25. Red (2) block is 4x4, Area=16. Maroon (9) block is 4x4, Area=16. Max Area=25. Only Yellow block has this area. Output color 4. **Matches.**\n*   **Example 2:** Green (3) block bounding box is 6x6, Area=36. Gray (5) block is 5x5, Area=25. Maroon (9) block is 4x4, Area=16. Yellow (4) block is 7x7, Area=49. Blue(1) block is 2x2, Area=4. Max Area=49 (Yellow). Wait, the output is Green(3). Let's recheck bounding boxes.\n    *   Green(3): min_r=6, max_r=12, min_c=11, max_c=14. Height=7, Width=4. Area=28.\n    *   Gray(5): min_r=1, max_r=5, min_c=13, max_c=17. Height=5, Width=5. Area=25.\n    *   Maroon(9): min_r=4, max_r=7, min_c=3, max_c=6. Height=4, Width=4. Area=16.\n    *   Yellow(4): min_r=15, max_r=18, min_c=1, max_c=7. Height=4, Width=7. Area=28.\n    *   Azure(8): Several blocks. Largest seems 5x5 (top left), Area=25.\n    *   Blue(1): Largest seems 2x2, Area=4.\n    Max Area is 28, shared by Green(3) and Yellow(4). Tie-breaker: Highest color index -> Yellow(4). Still doesn't match expected Green(3).\n\nLet's reconsider \"Largest\". Maybe it's not bounding box area, but the number of pixels in the contiguous block itself?\n\n*   **Example 1:** Yellow(4) pixels=25. Red(2) pixels=16. Maroon(9) pixels=16. Max pixels=25 (Yellow). Output 4. **Matches.**\n*   **Example 2:** Green(3) pixels=21. Gray(5) pixels=25. Maroon(9) pixels=16. Yellow(4) pixels=21. Azure(8) pixels (largest block) = 9. Blue(1) pixels (largest block) = 4. Max pixels=25 (Gray). Expected Green(3). Still doesn't match. Gray(5) has the most pixels.\n*   **Example 3:** Azure(8) pixels=56. Red(2) pixels=16. Yellow(4) pixels=21. Magenta(6) pixels=34. Max pixels=56 (Azure). Expected Azure(8). **Matches!**\n\nSo, the rule might be: Find the contiguous block with the maximum number of pixels. If there's a tie, use a tie-breaker.\n\nLet's re-check Example 2 with this rule: Max pixels is 25 (Gray - color 5). Expected output is Green (3). Why? The Gray block *is* a perfect 5x5 square. The Green block has 21 pixels. What if the rule prioritizes perfect squares?\n\nRevised Hypothesis 3:\n1. Find all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.\n2. Identify which blocks are \"perfect solid squares\" (equal height/width bounding box, pixel count equals area).\n3. If perfect solid squares exist:\n    a. Find the maximum side length among perfect solid squares.\n    b. Identify all perfect solid squares with this maximum side length.\n    c. Among these, choose the one with the *highest* color index.\n4. If *no* perfect solid squares exist:\n    a. Find the contiguous block with the maximum number of pixels.\n    b. Identify all blocks with this maximum pixel count.\n    c. Among these, choose the one with the *highest* color index.\n5. Fill the 3x3 output grid with the chosen color.\n\nLet's test Hypothesis 3:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Perfect squares? Yes: Yellow(4) 5x5, Red(2) 4x4, Maroon(9) 4x4.\n    *   Max side length = 5.\n    *   Largest perfect square: Yellow(4) 5x5.\n    *   Chosen color: 4. **Matches.**\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Perfect squares? Yes: Gray(5) 5x5, Maroon(9) 4x4, Blue(1) 2x2.\n    *   Max side length = 5.\n    *   Largest perfect square: Gray(5) 5x5.\n    *   Chosen color: 5. Expected: 3. **Fails.**\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Perfect squares? Yes: Red(2) 4x4, Yellow(4) 4x4. (Maybe others?) Let's assume the large Azure block isn't perfect.\n    *   Max side length = 4.\n    *   Largest perfect squares: Red(2) 4x4, Yellow(4) 4x4.\n    *   Tie-breaker (max color): Yellow(4). Expected: 8. **Fails.**\n\nIt seems the definition of the target object is still elusive. Let's go back to the simplest idea that worked for 2/3 examples: Max pixel count, tie-break with max color.\n\n*   Ex 1: Max pixels = 25 (Yellow, 4). Output 4. Correct.\n*   Ex 2: Max pixels = 25 (Gray, 5). Tie-break -> 5. Output 5. Incorrect (Expected 3).\n*   Ex 3: Max pixels = 56 (Azure, 8). Tie-break -> 8. Output 8. Correct.\n\nWhat is special about Example 2? The largest pixel count object (Gray, 5) is chosen by this rule, but the answer is Green (3). Green has 21 pixels. Gray has 25. Is there a different tie-breaker?\nBlocks by pixel count (desc): Gray(5, 25), Green(3, 21), Yellow(4, 21), Maroon(9, 16), Azure(8, 9), Blue(1, 4).\nMax count is 25 (Gray). Why choose Green(3)? Green and Yellow both have 21 pixels. If we ignored the Gray(5) for some reason, the next highest count is 21, shared by Green(3) and Yellow(4). Tie-breaking with max color index would give Yellow(4). Still not Green(3). Tie-breaking with min color index would give Green(3).\n\nHypothesis 4:\n1. Find all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.\n2. Find the block(s) with the maximum pixel count.\n3. *If* there is only one block with the maximum pixel count, choose its color.\n4. *If* there is a tie for maximum pixel count, find the block(s) with the *second* maximum pixel count.\n5. From the set of blocks identified in step 3 or 4 (whichever is applicable), choose the color with the *minimum* color index.\n6. Fill the 3x3 output grid.\n\nLet's test Hypothesis 4:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Max pixels = 25 (Yellow, 4). Only one block. Choose color 4. **Matches.**\n*   **Example 2:** Max pixels = 25 (Gray, 5). Only one block. Choose color 5. Expected 3. **Fails.**\n\nThis is tricky. Let's return to the \"Largest Solid Square\" idea, but use the *Max Color* tie-breaker derived from Examples 1 and 3's successes with that rule (before we ran the code and found different squares). Maybe the `is_solid_square` logic was slightly off in the code execution?\n\nLet's assume the original `is_solid_square` *is* correct.\n\nRecap of code execution results:\n*   Ex 1: Largest solid square(s): size 5, color 4. Max color -> 4. **Matches.**\n*   Ex 2: Largest solid square(s): size 2, color 1. Max color -> 1. Expected 3. **Fails.**\n*   Ex 3: Largest solid square(s): size 1, colors {2, 3, 9}. Max color -> 9. Expected 8. **Fails.**\n\nThe initial code logic (Largest Solid Square, Min Color Tie-break) gave:\n*   Ex 1: 4 -> Correct\n*   Ex 2: 1 -> Incorrect (Expected 3)\n*   Ex 3: 2 -> Incorrect (Expected 8)\n\nThe \"Largest Solid Square, Max Color Tie-break\" hypothesis gave:\n*   Ex 1: 4 -> Correct\n*   Ex 2: 1 -> Incorrect (Expected 3)\n*   Ex 3: 9 -> Incorrect (Expected 8)\n\nThe simple \"Max Pixel Count, Max Color Tie-break\" hypothesis gave:\n*   Ex 1: 4 -> Correct\n*   Ex 2: 5 -> Incorrect (Expected 3)\n*   Ex 3: 8 -> Correct\n\nNo single rule tested so far works for all three. There must be a misunderstanding of the core object selection criteria.\n\nCould it be the largest object (by pixel count) that is *also* a square (even if not the largest square overall)?\n\nHypothesis 5:\n1. Find all contiguous blocks (objects).\n2. Identify which objects are also perfect solid squares.\n3. Find the object with the maximum pixel count *from the set of objects that are also perfect solid squares*.\n4. If there's a tie in pixel count among these square objects, use the maximum color index as a tie-breaker.\n5. If no objects are perfect solid squares, maybe default to white (0)? (Seems unlikely based on examples). Let's assume there's always at least one square-object.\n6. Fill 3x3 grid with the chosen color.\n\nTest Hypothesis 5:\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Objects that are Squares: Yellow(4, 25px, 5x5), Red(2, 16px, 4x4), Maroon(9, 16px, 4x4).\n    *   Max pixel count among these: 25 (Yellow).\n    *   Chosen color: 4. **Matches.**\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Objects that are Squares: Gray(5, 25px, 5x5), Maroon(9, 16px, 4x4), Blue(1, 4px, 2x2).\n    *   Max pixel count among these: 25 (Gray).\n    *   Chosen color: 5. Expected: 3. **Fails.**\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Objects that are Squares: Red(2, 16px, 4x4), Yellow(4, 16px, 4x4), others? (Assume these are the largest squares by pixel count).\n    *   Max pixel count among these: 16 (Red, Yellow).\n    *   Tie-breaker (max color): Yellow(4). Expected: 8. **Fails.**\n\nLet's reconsider the first successful code's logic: Largest solid square by *side length*, tie-break with *minimum* color. This worked for Ex1. Why did it fail the others?\nEx 2: Largest solid square side=2, color=1. Code output 1. Expected 3.\nEx 3: Largest solid square side=1, colors={2,3,9}. Min color=2. Code output 2. Expected 8.\n\nThe problem might be the definition of solid square used in the code. What if a \"solid square\" doesn't need to be perfectly filled, but just have a square bounding box?\n\nHypothesis 6:\n1.  Find all contiguous blocks (objects).\n2.  For each object, get its bounding box (height H, width W).\n3.  Identify objects where H == W (square bounding box).\n4.  Among these \"square-bounded\" objects, find the maximum side length (H).\n5.  Identify all \"square-bounded\" objects with this maximum side length.\n6.  Among these, choose the one with the *minimum* color index. (Returning to original tie-breaker).\n7.  Fill 3x3 grid.\n\nTest Hypothesis 6:\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Objects with square bounding boxes: Yellow(4, 5x5), Red(2, 4x4), Maroon(9, 4x4).\n    *   Max side length = 5.\n    *   Object(s) with max side length: Yellow(4, 5x5).\n    *   Chosen color: 4. **Matches.**\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Objects with square bounding boxes: Gray(5, 5x5), Maroon(9, 4x4), Azure(8, 5x5 - top left block?), Blue(1, 2x2). Green(3) is 7x4. Yellow(4) is 4x7.\n    *   Max side length = 5.\n    *   Object(s) with max side length: Gray(5, 5x5), Azure(8, 5x5).\n    *   Tie-breaker (min color): Gray(5). Expected: 3. **Fails.**\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Objects with square bounding boxes: Azure(8, 8x8), Red(2, 4x4), Yellow(4, 5x5). Magenta(6) is 7x7 (almost). Let's assume Azure(8) is 8x8 bbox, Magenta(6) is 7x7 bbox, Yellow(4) is 5x5, Red(2) is 4x4.\n    *   Max side length = 8.\n    *   Object(s) with max side length: Azure(8, 8x8).\n    *   Chosen color: 8. **Matches!**\n\nHypothesis 6 worked for Ex1 and Ex3. Why did it fail Ex2?\nIn Ex2, it chose Gray(5) because Gray(5) and Azure(8) both had 5x5 bounding boxes, and 5 < 8. The expected answer is Green(3). The Green(3) object has a 7x4 bounding box - not square.\n\nWhat if the rule is simply: Find the object with the largest bounding box *area*, tie-break with *minimum* color index?\n\nHypothesis 7:\n1. Find all contiguous blocks (objects).\n2. For each object, get its bounding box (H, W) and calculate Area = H * W.\n3. Find the maximum Area.\n4. Identify all objects whose bounding box has the maximum Area.\n5. Among these, choose the object with the *minimum* color index.\n6. Fill 3x3 grid.\n\nTest Hypothesis 7:\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Areas: Yellow(4, 5x5, A=25), Red(2, 4x4, A=16), Maroon(9, 4x4, A=16).\n    *   Max Area = 25.\n    *   Object(s) with max area: Yellow(4).\n    *   Chosen color: 4. **Matches.**\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Areas: Green(3, 7x4, A=28), Yellow(4, 4x7, A=28), Gray(5, 5x5, A=25), Maroon(9, 4x4, A=16), Azure(8, 5x5, A=25), Blue(1, 2x2, A=4).\n    *   Max Area = 28.\n    *   Object(s) with max area: Green(3), Yellow(4).\n    *   Tie-breaker (min color): Green(3). **Matches!**\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Areas: Azure(8, 8x8, A=64), Magenta(6, 7x7, A=49), Yellow(4, 5x5, A=25), Red(2, 4x4, A=16).\n    *   Max Area = 64.\n    *   Object(s) with max area: Azure(8).\n    *   Chosen color: 8. **Matches!**\n\nHypothesis 7 seems to work for all examples.\n\n## YAML Facts Documentation\n\n"
