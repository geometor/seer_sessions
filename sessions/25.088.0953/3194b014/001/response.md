Identify all contiguous blocks of pixels that have the same, non-white color.
Filter these blocks to find those that form perfect, solid squares (height equals width, and all pixels within the bounding box match the block's color).

Construct a 3x3 output grid and fill it entirely with the color of the largest square found.
