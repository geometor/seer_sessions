Among these, there is always one prominent, solid square shape composed of a single color (excluding the background color, white). The output grid is consistently a 3x3 solid grid, and its color matches the color of the largest solid square found in the corresponding input grid. The task seems to involve identifying this largest square object and using its color to generate the output.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
