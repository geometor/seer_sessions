**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid is predominantly composed of white pixels (0), with exactly two azure pixels (8) located at distinct positions.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the addition of several green pixels (3).
3.  **Transformation:** The green pixels form a path or line connecting the two azure pixels from the input.
4.  **Path Characteristics:** The path appears to trace the pixels that lie on the straight line segment connecting the centers of the two azure pixels. The azure pixels themselves are not changed to green; the green path fills the pixels *between* them. The path includes pixels that are touched by the line segment, effectively creating a "thick" line using grid cells.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Draw a line between two points on a grid.

elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
  - object: background_pixel
    color: white (0)
    description: The default pixel color composing the majority of the grid.
  - object: marker_pixel
    color: azure (8)
    count: 2
    description: Two distinct pixels in the input marking the start and end points.
  - object: line_pixel
    color: green (3)
    description: Pixels added in the output to form a line connecting the marker pixels.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The two marker_pixels exist at different coordinates in the input grid.
  - type: creation
    description: The line_pixels are created in the output grid based on the positions of the marker_pixels.
  - type: connection
    description: The line_pixels form a path representing the line segment between the two marker_pixels. The marker_pixels remain unchanged and are the endpoints of this path.

actions:
  - action: locate
    target: marker_pixel
    description: Find the row and column coordinates of the two azure (8) pixels.
  - action: draw_line
    start_point: first marker_pixel coordinates
    end_point: second marker_pixel coordinates
    color: green (3)
    description: Determine all grid cells that intersect with the geometric line segment connecting the centers of the start and end point cells. Change the color of these intersecting cells to green (3), excluding the start and end point cells themselves.
  - action: copy
    target: input grid
    destination: output grid
    description: The output grid initially mirrors the input grid.
  - action: modify
    target: output grid
    description: Pixels identified by the draw_line action are colored green (3).

constraints:
  - The line segment connecting the two marker pixels determines which pixels become green.
  - The original marker pixels (azure) retain their color and position in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Start with a copy of the input grid as the output grid.
2.  Identify the row and column coordinates of the two azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Let these be `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)`.
3.  Determine all integer grid coordinates `(r, c)` that lie on the line segment connecting the center of the cell `(r1, c1)` to the center of the cell `(r2, c2)`. This can be visualized as drawing a straight line between the centers and identifying every grid cell the line passes through.
4.  For each identified coordinate `(r, c)`:
    *   If `(r, c)` is not the same as `(r1, c1)` and not the same as `(r2, c2)`, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to green (3).
5.  Keep the original azure pixels at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` unchanged in the output grid.
6.  The final modified grid is the result.
