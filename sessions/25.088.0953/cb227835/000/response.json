The azure pixels themselves are not changed to green; the green path fills the pixels *between* them. The path includes pixels that are touched by the line segment, effectively creating a \"thick\" line using grid cells.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Identify the row and column coordinates of the two azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Let these be `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)`.\n3.  Determine all integer grid coordinates `(r, c)` that lie on the line segment connecting the center of the cell `(r1, c1)` to the center of the cell `(r2, c2)`. This can be visualized as drawing a straight line between the centers and identifying every grid cell the line passes through.\n4.  For each identified coordinate `(r, c)`:\n    *   If `(r, c)` is not the same as `(r1, c1)` and not the same as `(r2, c2)`, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to green (3).\n5.  Keep the original azure pixels at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` unchanged in the output grid.\n6.  The final modified grid is the result."
