task_description: Draw a line between two points on a grid.

elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
  - object: background_pixel
    color: white (0)
    description: The default pixel color composing the majority of the grid.
  - object: marker_pixel
    color: azure (8)
    count: 2
    description: Two distinct pixels in the input marking the start and end points.
  - object: line_pixel
    color: green (3)
    description: Pixels added in the output to form a line connecting the marker pixels.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The two marker_pixels exist at different coordinates in the input grid.
  - type: creation
    description: The line_pixels are created in the output grid based on the positions of the marker_pixels.
  - type: connection
    description: The line_pixels form a path representing the line segment between the two marker_pixels. The marker_pixels remain unchanged and are the endpoints of this path.

actions:
  - action: locate
    target: marker_pixel
    description: Find the row and column coordinates of the two azure (8) pixels.
  - action: draw_line
    start_point: first marker_pixel coordinates
    end_point: second marker_pixel coordinates
    color: green (3)
    description: Determine all grid cells that intersect with the geometric line segment connecting the centers of the start and end point cells. Change the color of these intersecting cells to green (3), excluding the start and end point cells themselves.
  - action: copy
    target: input grid
    destination: output grid
    description: The output grid initially mirrors the input grid.
  - action: modify
    target: output grid
    description: Pixels identified by the draw_line action are colored green (3).

constraints:
  - The line segment connecting the two marker pixels determines which pixels become green.
  - The original marker pixels (azure) retain their color and position in the output.
