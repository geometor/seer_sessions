The transformation consists of filling the area enclosed by these red shapes with a specific color, while leaving the red outline and the exterior background (white - 0) unchanged. The fill color depends on the type of shape ('5' or 'H') and whether the shape contains an internal red pixel in the input grid. Multiple shapes can exist within a single grid, and each is processed independently.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
