task_description: Fill the interior of closed red shapes ('5' or 'H') based on shape type and presence of internal red pixels.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Variable height and width (up to 30x30).
  - background_color: White (0).

objects:
  - type: Boundary
    color: Red (2)
    description: Forms closed loops resembling digits '5' or letters 'H'.
    persistence: Remain unchanged in the output.
  - type: Interior
    color: White (0) initially, potentially contains Red (2) pixels.
    description: The set of pixels enclosed by a Red boundary.
    action: White interior pixels are filled with a new color. Original Red interior pixels remain unchanged.
  - type: Fill Color
    description: The color used to fill the white interior pixels.
    depends_on:
      - Boundary Shape ('5' or 'H')
      - Presence of Red (2) pixels within the Interior in the input grid.

rules:
  - condition: Boundary shape is '5'.
    action: Fill white Interior pixels with Azure (8).
  - condition: Boundary shape is 'H' AND Input Interior contains Red (2) pixel(s).
    action: Fill white Interior pixels with Yellow (4).
  - condition: Boundary shape is 'H' AND Input Interior contains NO Red (2) pixels.
    action: Fill white Interior pixels with Green (3).

inconsistencies:
  - Example 3's expected output shows Green (3) fill for an 'H' shape that contains an internal Red (2) pixel, contradicting the rule derived from Examples 2 and 4. The implementation will follow the rule from Examples 2 and 4.

identified_code_issue:
  - Function `find_interior_coords` fails to identify enclosed white pixels. Needs replacement with a robust flood-fill approach (e.g., identify exterior white via border flood-fill, infer interior).
