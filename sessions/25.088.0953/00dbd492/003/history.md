"""
Identifies closed shapes formed by red (2) pixels in the input grid.
These shapes resemble either a digit '5' or a letter 'H'.
The transformation involves filling the area enclosed by these red shapes with a specific color, 
while leaving the red outline and the exterior background (white - 0) unchanged. 
The fill color depends on the shape type ('5' or 'H') and whether the shape contains an internal 
red pixel (2) in the input grid.

Rules:
1. Find all connected components of red (2) pixels.
2. For each component, determine the set of enclosed white (0) pixels (interior).
3. If an interior exists:
    a. Classify the red shape boundary as '5' or 'H'.
    b. Check if any red (2) pixel exists within the interior region in the *input* grid.
    c. Determine the fill color:
        - If shape is '5', fill color is azure (8).
        - If shape is 'H' and has internal red, fill color is yellow (4).
        - If shape is 'H' and has no internal red, fill color is green (3).
    d. Fill the interior white (0) pixels in the *output* grid with the determined fill color.
4. Pixels not part of an enclosed interior remain unchanged.

Okay, let's break down the analysis and refine the plan.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided Python code consistently fails across all training examples, producing the input grid as output without any transformation. The core issue appears to be the `find_interior_coords` function, which is failing to identify the white (0) pixels enclosed by the red (2) shapes. The logic within that function seems overly complex and likely contains errors preventing it from correctly identifying any interior regions.

The secondary potential issues are the shape classification (`classify_shape`) and the precise application of the filling rules, particularly for the 'H' shape, where Example 3's expected output seems inconsistent with the rule derived from Examples 2 and 4 ('H' with internal red -> Yellow(4)).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Rewrite `find_interior_coords`:** Replace the current complex logic with a more standard and robust approach. A good method is flood-filling (BFS) from the grid borders to identify all 'exterior' white pixels. Any white pixels not reached by this flood fill and not part of the red boundary itself are considered 'interior'. Ensure this logic correctly associates interior pixels with their specific enclosing boundary.
2.  **Verify Rule Consistency:** Assume the rules derived from Examples 1, 2, and 4 are correct ('5' -> Azure(8); 'H'+InternalRed -> Yellow(4); 'H'+NoInternalRed -> Green(3)). Proceed with this rule set, acknowledging the discrepancy in Example 3's expected output as potentially anomalous or based on a misinterpretation.
3.  **Test `classify_shape`:** Once interior finding works, test the existing shape classification heuristic. If it fails, refine it based on geometric properties (e.g., aspect ratio, presence/location of horizontal/vertical segments, number of enclosed regions).
4.  **Implement Filling:** Ensure the final step correctly modifies a copy of the input grid, filling *only* the identified white interior pixels with the determined color, leaving boundary pixels and original non-white interior pixels unchanged.

**Metrics and Observations**

*   **Input/Output Analysis:** All examples involve identifying closed shapes made of red (2) pixels on a white (0) background. These shapes resemble either a '5' or an 'H'. The transformation involves filling the *interior* white space of these shapes with a new color.
*   **Shape '5':**
    *   Examples 1, 3 (bottom-left), 4 (top-left).
    *   Rule: The white interior is always filled with Azure (8), regardless of whether the original interior contained any red pixels (as seen in Ex 3 & 4).
*   **Shape 'H':**
    *   Examples 2, 3 (top-right), 4 (bottom-right).
    *   Rule (derived from Ex 2 & 4): If the original white interior region *also* contained any red (2) pixels, fill the white parts with Yellow (4). If the original interior contained *only* white (0) pixels, fill with Green (3).
    *   Inconsistency: Example 3 (top-right) shows an 'H' with an internal red pixel, but the expected output uses Green (3) fill, contradicting the rule from Ex 2 & 4. We will proceed with the rule from Ex 2 & 4.
*   **Core Problem:** The `find_interior_coords` function in the previous code fails to identify *any* interior pixels in all examples, leading to no pixels being filled.

**YAML Fact Sheet**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the interior of closed red shapes ('5' or 'H') based on shape type and presence of internal red pixels.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Variable height and width (up to 30x30).
  - background_color: White (0).

objects:
  - type: Boundary
    color: Red (2)
    description: Forms closed loops resembling digits '5' or letters 'H'.
    persistence: Remain unchanged in the output.
  - type: Interior
    color: White (0) initially, potentially contains Red (2) pixels.
    description: The set of pixels enclosed by a Red boundary.
    action: White interior pixels are filled with a new color. Original Red interior pixels remain unchanged.
  - type: Fill Color
    description: The color used to fill the white interior pixels.
    depends_on:
      - Boundary Shape ('5' or 'H')
      - Presence of Red (2) pixels within the Interior in the input grid.

rules:
  - condition: Boundary shape is '5'.
    action: Fill white Interior pixels with Azure (8).
  - condition: Boundary shape is 'H' AND Input Interior contains Red (2) pixel(s).
    action: Fill white Interior pixels with Yellow (4).
  - condition: Boundary shape is 'H' AND Input Interior contains NO Red (2) pixels.
    action: Fill white Interior pixels with Green (3).

inconsistencies:
  - Example 3's expected output shows Green (3) fill for an 'H' shape that contains an internal Red (2) pixel, contradicting the rule derived from Examples 2 and 4. The implementation will follow the rule from Examples 2 and 4.

identified_code_issue:
  - Function `find_interior_coords` fails to identify enclosed white pixels. Needs replacement with a robust flood-fill approach (e.g., identify exterior white via border flood-fill, infer interior).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  **Identify Boundaries:** Find all distinct connected components (objects) of red (2) pixels in the input grid. These are the shape boundaries. Keep track of visited red pixels to process each shape only once.
3.  **For each Red Boundary:**
    a.  **Find Enclosed Interior:** Determine the set of white (0) pixels that are enclosed by this specific red boundary.
        i.  Perform a flood fill (e.g., Breadth-First Search) starting from all white (0) pixels located on the grid's border (top/bottom rows, left/right columns).
        ii. Mark all white pixels reachable from the border *without crossing the current red boundary* as 'exterior'.
        iii. Identify all white pixels in the grid that were *not* marked as 'exterior'. These are potential 'interior' pixels.
        iv. Verify that these potential interior pixels form contiguous regions adjacent only to the current red boundary or other potential interior pixels associated with this boundary. Assign the verified set as the `interior_coords` for this boundary.
    b.  **Check for Internal Red:** Examine the `interior_coords` locations in the *original input grid*. Check if any of these locations contain a red (2) pixel. Record this as `has_internal_red` (True/False).
    c.  **Classify Shape:** Analyze the geometry of the `boundary_coords` to classify the shape as '5' or 'H'. Use heuristics based on structure (e.g., presence and location of horizontal/vertical segments, aspect ratio).
    d.  **Determine Fill Color:**
        i.  If the shape is '5', the `fill_color` is Azure (8).
        ii. If the shape is 'H' and `has_internal_red` is True, the `fill_color` is Yellow (4).
        iii. If the shape is 'H' and `has_internal_red` is False, the `fill_color` is Green (3).
    e.  **Apply Fill:** Iterate through the `interior_coords`. For each coordinate `(r, c)` in the `interior_coords`: if the pixel at `output_grid[r, c]` is currently white (0), change its value to the determined `fill_color`. (This ensures original internal red pixels are preserved).
4.  **Return Output:** Return the modified output grid.
