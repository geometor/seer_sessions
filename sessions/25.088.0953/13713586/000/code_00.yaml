Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Pixels: Represent colors (0-9)
  Background: Primarily white (0)
Boundary:
  Type: Object
  Shape: Line (horizontal or vertical)
  Color: Gray (5)
  Location: Always along one single edge of the grid (top, bottom, left, or right).
  Function: Acts as a stop condition for filling.
Colored_Objects:
  Type: Object(s)
  Shape: Variable, often lines or segments initially.
  Color: Any color except white (0) and gray (5).
  Contiguity: Pixels of the same color are connected.
  Function: Act as sources for filling and stop conditions for other fills.
Transformation:
  Action: Fill
  Target: White (0) pixels.
  Mechanism: Iterative color propagation from non-white, non-gray pixels.
  Direction_Rule: Determined by the location of the Gray Boundary.
    - If Boundary is Bottom, Fill Direction is Down.
    - If Boundary is Right, Fill Direction is Right.
    - If Boundary is Left, Fill Direction is Left.
    - If Boundary is Top, Fill Direction is Up.
  Propagation_Rule: A white pixel at (r, c) changes color based on the Fill Direction:
    - Down: Takes color from pixel (r-1, c) if it's non-white/non-gray.
    - Right: Takes color from pixel (r, c-1) if it's non-white/non-gray.
    - Left: Takes color from pixel (r, c+1) if it's non-white/non-gray.
    - Up: Takes color from pixel (r+1, c) if it's non-white/non-gray.
  Stop_Condition: Filling stops when a pixel encounters a non-white pixel (either another Colored_Object or the Gray Boundary) in the Fill Direction.
  Iteration: The filling process repeats until no more white pixels can change color according to the rules in a single pass.
