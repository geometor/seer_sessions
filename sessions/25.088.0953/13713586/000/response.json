            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both grids of pixels with different colors.\n2.  **Background:** The primary background color is white (0).\n3.  **Colored Objects:** Each input grid contains one or more distinct, contiguous blocks (objects) of non-white, non-gray colors (e.g., yellow, azure, green in train_1; red, green, orange in train_2; green, magenta, red in train_3). These objects appear as lines or small segments.\n4.  **Gray Border:** A single, straight line of gray (5) pixels exists along one edge of the grid (bottom in train_1, right in train_2, left in train_3). This gray line acts as a boundary or wall.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves filling the white (0) space. The colored objects seem to \"expand\" or \"fill\" the adjacent white space in a specific direction until they hit another colored object or the gray border.\n6.  **Fill Directionality:** The direction of the fill appears to be determined by the location of the gray border.\n    *   If the gray border is at the bottom, the fill direction is downwards.\n    *   If the gray border is at the right, the fill direction is rightwards.\n    *   If the gray border is at the left, the fill direction is leftwards.\n    *   It's logical to assume if the border were at the top, the fill direction would be upwards.\n7.  **Fill Mechanism:** A white pixel changes color if the pixel immediately adjacent to it *opposite* the fill direction (e.g., the pixel above for downward fill, the pixel left for rightward fill) is a non-white, non-gray color. The white pixel takes on that adjacent pixel's color. This process repeats iteratively until no more white pixels can be filled according to the rule for that direction.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
