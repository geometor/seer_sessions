```python
"""
Identify the gray boundary line (color 5) along one edge of the input grid.
Determine the fill direction based on the boundary's location:
- Bottom boundary -> Fill Down
- Right boundary -> Fill Right
- Left boundary -> Fill Left
- Top boundary -> Fill Up
Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
Iteratively fill white pixels (color 0) in the output grid.
In each iteration pass:
  For every white pixel:
    Check the pixel adjacent to it in the direction *opposite* the fill direction (the "source" pixel).
    If the source pixel is within bounds and its color is neither white (0) nor gray (5), change the white pixel's color to the source pixel's color.
Repeat the iteration passes until no white pixels change color in a full pass.
Return the final output grid.
