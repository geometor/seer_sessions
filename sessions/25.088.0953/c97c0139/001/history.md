Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grid contains a white background (color 0) and one or more objects composed of red pixels (color 2). In the provided examples, these red objects are simple horizontal or vertical lines.
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid preserves the original red objects from the input. Additionally, for each red object, a diamond shape made of azure pixels (color 8) is drawn onto the grid. The azure diamond is centered on the corresponding red object and its size is related to the size of the red object.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying each red object, determining its center and size, calculating a radius based on its size, and then drawing an azure diamond shape centered at the object's center with the calculated radius using Manhattan distance. This drawing action only affects white background pixels, leaving the original red pixels and any pixels already colored azure (if diamonds overlap) untouched.
4.  **Object Properties:**
    *   Red objects appear to be lines (1 pixel thick).
    *   The size (length) of the red line determines the size of the azure diamond.
    *   The geometric center of the red line determines the center of the azure diamond.
5.  **Diamond Properties:**
    *   The diamond shape is defined by the Manhattan distance from its center.
    *   The radius (maximum Manhattan distance) `K` appears to be calculated as `floor((L - 1) / 2)`, where `L` is the length (number of pixels, or max dimension) of the red line.
    *   The center of the diamond coincides with the center of the red line. For lines with an even number of pixels, the center coordinate seems to be rounded up (e.g., a line from column 2 to 15 has length 14, center coordinate (2+15)/2 = 8.5, and the diamond appears centered at column 9).

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input Grid:
  - Contains Background:
      Color: white (0)
  - Contains Objects:
      Type: RedLine
      Color: red (2)
      Shape: Horizontal or Vertical Line (contiguous pixels)
      Quantity: One or more

Output Grid:
  - Contains Background:
      Color: white (0)
  - Contains Objects:
      Type: RedLine
      Color: red (2)
      Persistence: Preserved from input grid
      Relationship: Each RedLine corresponds to an AzureDiamond
      Type: AzureDiamond
      Color: azure (8)
      Shape: Diamond (defined by Manhattan distance)
      Quantity: One per RedLine in input
      Placement: Overwrites only white (0) pixels from the input grid
      Properties:
        Center: Coincides with the center of the corresponding RedLine.
               Calculation: Geometric center (median pixel coordinates). If average coordinate is X.5, round up to X+1.
        Radius (K): Determined by the maximum dimension (Length, L) of the corresponding RedLine.
               Calculation: K = floor((L - 1) / 2)
        Coverage: Fills pixels (r, c) where Manhattan distance |r - center_r| + |c - center_c| <= K.

Transformation:
  - Step 1: Identify all distinct connected components of red (2) pixels (RedLines) in the input grid.
  - Step 2: For each identified RedLine:
      a. Determine its pixels and calculate its bounding box / dimensions (Height H, Width W).
      b. Find the maximum dimension (Length): L = max(H, W).
      c. Calculate the diamond radius: K = floor((L - 1) / 2).
      d. Calculate the center coordinates (center_r, center_c) of the RedLine (using median pixel, rounding .5 coordinates up).
      e. Generate the set of coordinates (r, c) for the AzureDiamond: all (r, c) such that |r - center_r| + |c - center_c| <= K.
  - Step 3: Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
  - Step 4: For each generated AzureDiamond coordinate set:
      a. Iterate through the coordinates (r, c) in the set.
      b. If the pixel at (r, c) in the output grid is currently white (0), change its color to azure (8).

Relationships:
  - One-to-one mapping between input RedLines and output AzureDiamonds.
  - AzureDiamond is geometrically centered on its corresponding RedLine.
  - AzureDiamond size (Radius K) is derived from the RedLine's maximum dimension (Length L).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid.
2.  Find all separate groups (connected components) of red pixels. Treat each group as a single object (which appears to be a line in the examples).
3.  For each red object found:
    a.  Determine the coordinates of all pixels belonging to this object.
    b.  Calculate the object's length (L), which is the number of pixels it contains (or its maximum dimension - width for horizontal lines, height for vertical lines).
    c.  Calculate a radius value `K` using the formula: `K = floor((L - 1) / 2)`.
    d.  Find the center coordinate `(center_r, center_c)` of the object. This is the median pixel's coordinate. If the object has an even number of pixels along its length, causing the center coordinate to be halfway between two integers (e.g., 8.5), round this coordinate up to the next integer (e.g., 9).
    e.  Identify all grid coordinates `(r, c)` whose Manhattan distance to the center `(center_r, center_c)` is less than or equal to `K`. The Manhattan distance is calculated as `|r - center_r| + |c - center_c|`.
    f.  For each coordinate `(r, c)` identified in the previous step, check its color in the current grid state. If the color is white (0), change it to azure (8). Do not change pixels that are already red or have been changed to azure by a previous object's diamond.
4.  The final state of the grid after processing all red objects is the output grid.
