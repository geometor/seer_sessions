Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2.  Identify all distinct connected components (objects) of red pixels (color 2) using 4-way adjacency.\n3.  For each distinct red object found:\n    a.  Calculate the object's geometric center (center_r, center_c). This is done by finding the average row and column coordinates of all pixels in the object and rounding to the nearest integer.\n    b.  Determine the object's bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).\n    c.  Calculate the height (max_r - min_r + 1) and width (max_c - min_c + 1) of the bounding box.\n    d.  Calculate a size parameter K = floor((max(height, width) - 1) / 2). This generalizes the observed line behavior where K was based on length.\n    e.  Define a diamond shape centered at (center_r, center_c). A pixel (r, c) is part of the diamond if its Manhattan distance to the center (|r - center_r| + |c - center_c|) is less than or equal to K.\n    f.  Iterate through all pixels (r, c) within the bounding box of the generated diamond shape.\n    g.  If a pixel (r, c) is within the grid boundaries and also part of the calculated diamond shape:\n        i. Check the color of the pixel at output_grid[r, c].\n        ii. If the color is white (0), change the color of output_grid[r, c] to azure (8). Other colors (including the original red object pixels) remain unchanged.\n4.  Return the final modified output grid.\n\nUncertainties/Assumptions:\n- The method for calculating the center (rounding the average) is a hypothesis.\n- The method for calculating K (based on max bounding box dimension) is a hypothesis.\n- The output shape is assumed to be a diamond.\n- Modification only occurs on white pixels.\n- Overlapping diamonds will paint azure over existing azure, effectively having no change after the first diamond covers a white pixel.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all connected components of a specified color in the grid using 4-way adjacency.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n        color (int): The color of the objects to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[tuple[int, int]]]: A list where each element is a list\n                                     of (row, col) coordinates for one object.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and not visited[r, c]:\n                # Start BFS to find a connected component\n                component = []\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                \n                while q:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = q.popleft()\n                    component.append((curr_r, curr_c))\n\n                    # Check neighbors (4-connectivity: up, down, left, right)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n                        # Check bounds and if it's the target color and not visited\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                \n                if component:\n                    objects.append(component)\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by finding red objects, calculating their center \n    and a size parameter based on their bounding box, and drawing azure diamonds \n    around them, modifying only white pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): The input grid represented as a list of lists.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: The transformed grid represented as a list of lists.\n                         Returns the original grid if input is invalid or no red objects found.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Validate input grid format\n    if not isinstance(input_grid, list) or not input_grid or not isinstance(input_grid[0], list):\n        print(\"Invalid input grid format.
