            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** The input grid contains a white background (color 0) and one or more objects composed of red pixels (color 2). In the provided examples, these red objects are simple horizontal or vertical lines.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid preserves the original red objects from the input. Additionally, for each red object, a diamond shape made of azure pixels (color 8) is drawn onto the grid. The azure diamond is centered on the corresponding red object and its size is related to the size of the red object.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying each red object, determining its center and size, calculating a radius based on its size, and then drawing an azure diamond shape centered at the object's center with the calculated radius using Manhattan distance. This drawing action only affects white background pixels, leaving the original red pixels and any pixels already colored azure (if diamonds overlap) untouched.\n4.  **Object Properties:**\n    *   Red objects appear to be lines (1 pixel thick).\n    *   The size (length) of the red line determines the size of the azure diamond.\n    *   The geometric center of the red line determines the center of the azure diamond.\n5.  **Diamond Properties:**\n    *   The diamond shape is defined by the Manhattan distance from its center.\n    *   The radius (maximum Manhattan distance) `K` appears to be calculated as `floor((L - 1) / 2)`, where `L` is the length (number of pixels, or max dimension) of the red line.\n    *   The center of the diamond coincides with the center of the red line. For lines with an even number of pixels, the center coordinate seems to be rounded up (e.g., a line from column 2 to 15 has length 14, center coordinate (2+15)/2 = 8.5, and the diamond appears centered at column 9).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

If the object has an even number of pixels along its length, causing the center coordinate to be halfway between two integers (e.g., 8.5), round this coordinate up to the next integer (e.g., 9).\n    e.  Identify all grid coordinates `(r, c)` whose Manhattan distance to the center `(center_r, center_c)` is less than or equal to `K`. The Manhattan distance is calculated as `|r - center_r| + |c - center_c|`.\n    f.  For each coordinate `(r, c)` identified in the previous step, check its color in the current grid state. If the color is white (0), change it to azure (8). Do not change pixels that are already red or have been changed to azure by a previous object's diamond.\n4.
