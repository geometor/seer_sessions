            "text": "**Perception**\n\nThe input grids contain a white background (0) and multiple distinct objects composed of azure (8) pixels. These azure objects often resemble numerical digits formed on a grid, similar to a seven-segment display, but can also be other connected shapes. The output grids retain the exact shapes and positions of the azure objects from the input, but the azure color (8) is replaced with other colors: blue (1), red (2), green (3), or yellow (4). The white background remains unchanged.\n\nThe core transformation involves identifying each separate azure object, determining a specific color for each object based on a rule, and then recoloring all pixels of that object with its assigned color. The rule for assigning colors appears to depend on the total number of azure objects found in the input grid and the order in which these objects are encountered (e.g., determined by scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right based on the object's top-leftmost pixel). A specific sequence of colors is assigned to the ordered objects, and this sequence itself is determined by the total object count.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
