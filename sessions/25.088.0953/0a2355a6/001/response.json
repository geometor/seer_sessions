Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  Count the total number of these azure objects found (let the count be N).\n3.  Determine the order of these objects based on their spatial position: sort them primarily by the row index of their top-most pixel, and secondarily by the column index of their left-most pixel. Let the ordered objects be O_1, O_2, ..., O_N.\n4.  Select a specific sequence of output colors based on the total object count N:\n    *   If N is 3, the color sequence is [blue(1), blue(1), green(3)].\n    *   If N is 4, the color sequence is [red(2), blue(1), green(3), blue(1)].\n    *   If N is 5, the color sequence is [yellow(4), yellow(4), green(3), red(2), blue(1)].\n5.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.\n6.  For each object O_i (from i=1 to N) in the ordered list, find the i-th color (C_i) in the selected color sequence.\n7.  Change the color of all pixels belonging to object O_i in the output grid to the assigned color C_i.\n8.  Leave all background (white, 0) pixels unchanged.\n9.  The final modified grid is the result.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_objects(grid, target_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of a specified color in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        target_color (int): The color of the objects to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of objects, where each object is a set of (row, col) tuples.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if grid[r, c] == target_color and not visited[r, c]:\n                # Found the start of a new object\n                obj_coords = set()\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    obj_coords.add((row, col))\n\n                    # Check neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == target_color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                \n                if obj_coords:\n                    objects.append(obj_coords)\n    return objects\n\ndef _get_object_top_left(obj_coords):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the top-most, then left-most coordinate of an object.\n\n    Args:\n        obj_coords (set): A set of (row, col) tuples representing the object.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: The (min_row, min_col) coordinate.\n    \"\"\"\n    min_row = min(r for r, c in obj_coords)\n    min_col = min(c for r, c in obj_coords if r == min_row)\n    return (min_row, min_col)\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by finding azure (8) objects, ordering them,\n    determining a color sequence based on the object count, and recoloring\n    each object according to the sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # 1.
