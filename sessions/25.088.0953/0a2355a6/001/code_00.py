Transformation Rule:

1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Count the total number of these azure objects found (let the count be N).
3.  Determine the order of these objects based on their spatial position: sort them primarily by the row index of their top-most pixel, and secondarily by the column index of their left-most pixel. Let the ordered objects be O_1, O_2, ..., O_N.
4.  Select a specific sequence of output colors based on the total object count N:
    *   If N is 3, the color sequence is [blue(1), blue(1), green(3)].
    *   If N is 4, the color sequence is [red(2), blue(1), green(3), blue(1)].
    *   If N is 5, the color sequence is [yellow(4), yellow(4), green(3), red(2), blue(1)].
5.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
6.  For each object O_i (from i=1 to N) in the ordered list, find the i-th color (C_i) in the selected color sequence.
7.  Change the color of all pixels belonging to object O_i in the output grid to the assigned color C_i.
8.  Leave all background (white, 0) pixels unchanged.
9.  The final modified grid is the result.
