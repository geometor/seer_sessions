task_description: Recolors azure objects based on their count and order, with the color sequence depending on the count and potentially grid height.
observations:
  - The transformation targets contiguous objects composed solely of azure (8) pixels.
  - The background (white, 0) pixels remain unchanged.
  - All azure objects in the input are recolored in the output.
  - The number of azure objects (N) determines the primary logic for choosing a color sequence.
  - The azure objects are sorted based on their top-most, then left-most pixel coordinate.
  - The i-th object in the sorted list is assigned the i-th color from the selected sequence.
  - Specific color sequences are observed for different N:
    - N = 3: The sequence is [blue(1), blue(1), green(3)]. (Observed in Ex1, Height=9)
    - N = 4: Two different sequences are observed:
      - Sequence [red(2), blue(1), green(3), blue(1)] is used when the input grid height is 14. (Observed in Ex2, Ex3)
      - Sequence [yellow(4), green(3), red(2), blue(1)] is used when the input grid height is 15. (Observed in Ex4)
  - No examples are provided for N=5 or other counts, so the sequence for those cases is undetermined from the training data. (The initial assumption of N=5 for Ex4 and sequence [4,4,3,2,1] was based on faulty interpretation/reporting).
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    attributes: [static]
  - type: target_object
    color: azure (8)
    attributes: [contiguous, variable_shape, variable_size]
    actions: [identify, count, sort, recolor]
  - type: output_object
    color: [blue(1), red(2), green(3), yellow(4)]
    attributes: [derived_from_target]
    source_object: target_object
    relationship: The color depends on the total count (N) of target_objects, the input grid height (H), and the object's position in the sorted list.
sorting:
  - criteria: [top_most_row, left_most_column]
    applied_to: target_object (azure)
color_mapping_rules:
  - condition: N = 3
    sequence: [blue(1), blue(1), green(3)]
  - condition: N = 4 AND H = 14
    sequence: [red(2), blue(1), green(3), blue(1)]
  - condition: N = 4 AND H = 15
    sequence: [yellow(4), green(3), red(2), blue(1)]
  # Note: Sequence for N=5 or other N is unknown from training data.
