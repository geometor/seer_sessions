Transformation Rule:

1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  If no azure objects are found, return the input grid unchanged.
3.  Count the total number of these azure objects found (let the count be N).
4.  Determine the height of the input grid (let the height be H).
5.  Determine the order of these objects based on their spatial position: sort them primarily by the row index of their top-most pixel, and secondarily by the column index of their left-most pixel. Let the ordered objects be O_1, O_2, ..., O_N.
6.  Select a specific sequence of output colors (Color Sequence) based on the object count N and grid height H:
    *   If N is 3, the Color Sequence is [blue(1), blue(1), green(3)].
    *   If N is 4 and H is 14, the Color Sequence is [red(2), blue(1), green(3), blue(1)].
    *   If N is 4 and H is 15, the Color Sequence is [yellow(4), green(3), red(2), blue(1)].
    *   For other values of N or H not covered by the examples, the rule is undefined by the training data. Assume failure or default behavior (e.g., return input) if encountered.
7.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
8.  For each object O_i (from i=1 to N) in the ordered list, find the i-th color (C_i) in the selected Color Sequence.
9.  Change the color of all pixels belonging to object O_i in the output grid to the assigned color C_i.
10. Leave all background (white, 0) pixels unchanged.
11. The final modified grid is the result.
