These new `red` pixels fill connected areas of `white` pixels originating from the initial `red` pixel.\n    *   The filling process is constrained by the `azure` pixels, which act as impenetrable barriers. The fill does not cross or replace `azure` pixels.\n    *   The fill seems to propagate in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) through contiguous `white` pixels.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
