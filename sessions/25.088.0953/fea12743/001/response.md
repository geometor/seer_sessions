    Transforms the input grid based on comparisons between pairs of 4x4 red shapes.

    The grid contains pairs of 4x4 areas containing red (2) shapes, arranged horizontally
    and separated by a column of white (0). These pairs are located at specific rows.
    The transformation compares the left and right shapes within each pair.

    1. Identify the three pairs of shapes based on their top-left corner row indices (1, 6, 11).
       The left shape starts at column 1, the right shape at column 6. Each shape is 4x4.
    2. For each pair (L, R):
       a. If the shapes L and R are identical (pixel by pixel):
          - Count the number of red pixels (`count`) in the shape.
          - Apply specific color changes based on `count` and the pair's row index:
            - If `count` is 8: Change L to green (3), R to azure (8).
            - If `count` is 11: Change L to azure (8), R to green (3).
            *   If `count` is 12:
                *   If it's the first pair (row 1): Change R to azure (8).
                *   If it's the second pair (row 6): Change L to azure (8).
                *   If it's the third pair (row 11): Change R to green (3).
       b. If the shapes L and R are different:
          - If it's the first or second pair (row 1 or 6):
            - Count red pixels in L (`count_L`) and R (`count_R`).
            - If `count_L > count_R`: Change L to azure (8).
            - If `count_L < count_R`: Change R to azure (8).
          - If it's the third pair (row 11): No change.
