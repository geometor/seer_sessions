The output grids modify the interior of these blue rectangles, leaving the white background unchanged. The blue pixels are replaced with colors blue (1), red (2), and green (3) forming concentric layers or contours within the original rectangle shapes. The outermost layer of the original blue rectangle remains blue. Moving inwards, the color typically changes to red, then green, then potentially back to red, suggesting a pattern related to the distance from the edge (the surrounding white background).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

(Chebyshev distance considers orthogonal and diagonal neighbors as distance 1).\n    - Assign a new color to the pixel in the output grid based on the calculated distance 'd'.\n    - The color mapping follows a cyclical pattern:\n      - If d = 1, color = 1 (blue).\n      - If d = 2, color = 2 (red).\n      - If d = 3, color = 3 (green).\n      - If d = 4, color = 2 (red).\n      - This pattern repeats every 4 steps: [1, 2, 3, 2]. The color for distance 'd' is given by the element at index `(d-1) % 4` in the sequence [1, 2, 3, 2].\n  - Invariant: Non-blue pixels (white background) remain unchanged in the output grid.\nOutput Grid:\n  - Background: Identical to input background (white, 0).\n  - Objects: Original blue rectangles are now filled with layered colors (1, 2, 3) according to the distance-based rule.
