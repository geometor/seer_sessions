Okay, the tool execution reveals the critical error!
`red_pixels_coords=array([[ 3, 8], [ 6, 4], [ 6, 12], [ 9, 10], [11, 7]])`
The `np.argwhere` found the red pixel at (11, 7), not (11, 8). Let me re-examine the input grid for Example 1 visually.

Input Ex 1:
Row 3: ... 2 ... -> (3, 8) - Correct
Row 6: ... 2 ... 2 -> (6, 4), (6, 12) - Correct
Row 9: ... 2 ... -> (9, 10) - Correct
Row 11: ... 2 ... -> (11, 7) - **INCORRECT**. The input grid clearly shows `2` at index 7 (8th column) for row index 11.
`[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` <- Row 11

Why did `np.argwhere` give (11, 7)? Maybe there was a typo when the input grid was copied into the tool code block? Let me re-copy from the prompt.
Input Grid Ex 1 from prompt:
Row 11 (index 11): `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0` -> The 2 is at index 7.
Wait, indexing. Python lists are 0-indexed. `np.argwhere` returns `(row_index, column_index)`.
Row 0
Row 1
Row 2
Row 3: ... 2 ... (col 8) -> index (3, 8)
...
Row 6: ... 2 ... (col 4), ... 2 (col 12) -> index (6, 4), (6, 12)
...
Row 9: ... 2 ... (col 10) -> index (9, 10)
...
Row 11: ... 2 ... (col 7) -> index (11, 7)

Ah, I was misreading the grid viewer/prompt earlier. The red pixel IS at (11, 7).
So the red pixels are indeed `(3, 8), (6, 4), (6, 12), (9, 10), (11, 7)`.

Now, let's re-check the expected output for Example 1 based on these coordinates and the "connect aligned pairs" hypothesis.
*   Red pixels: `(3, 8), (6, 4), (6, 12), (9, 10), (11, 7)`
*   Aligned pairs:
    *   Row 6: (6, 4) and (6, 12). Connect with green from col 5 to 11.
    *   Any others?
        *   (3, 8) aligns with nothing.
        *   (9, 10) aligns with nothing.
        *   (11, 7) aligns with nothing.
*   This hypothesis only produces the horizontal line on row 6. This matches the *code's output* but *not* the *expected output*.

Let's reconsider the expected output's green pixels (assuming my corrected reading that (9,10) is RED, not green):
Green: (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 5..11), (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8), (10, 8)
This implies a vertical line in col 8 from row 4 to row 10, and a horizontal line in row 6 from col 5 to col 11.
The horizontal line comes from (6, 4) and (6, 12).
Where does the vertical line come from? It spans rows 4 to 10. The red pixels nearby are (3, 8) and... nothing else in column 8. The next red pixel vertically is (11, 7) - wrong column.

There must be a flaw in my understanding or reading.
Let's look at Example 2.
Input Reds: (2, 5), (6, 2), (7, 10), (10, 8), (12, 5)
Expected Output Greens imply:
*   Vertical line col 5, rows 3-12 (connecting (2,5) and (12,5))
*   Horizontal line row 7, cols 3-9 (connecting (6,2) ??? and (7,10) ???) -> No, this line seems to connect (6,2) and (7,10). But they are not aligned.
*   Horizontal line row 10, cols 6-7 (connecting (10,5)?? and (10,8)) -> Green pixels are at (10,6), (10,7). Red is at (10,8). Where is the other end? Is it the vertical line at (10,5)?

Let's try a different hypothesis:
Maybe it's not about *pairs*. Maybe it's about *sets* of aligned pixels.
Hypothesis 2: For each row and each column, find all red pixels. If there are 2 or more, draw a green line between the minimum and maximum coordinate red pixels in that row/column.

Test Hypothesis 2 on Example 1:
*   Reds: `(3, 8), (6, 4), (6, 12), (9, 10), (11, 7)`
*   Rows:
    *   Row 6: Reds at col 4, 12. Min=4, Max=12. Draw green row 6, cols 5..11. -> Matches output.
*   Columns:
    *   Col 4: Red at row 6. (1 only)
    *   Col 7: Red at row 11. (1 only)
    *   Col 8: Red at row 3. (1 only) -> Wait, I misread input again? Row 11, Col 8 is red? Let me look *really* carefully.
    
```
    ...
    10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0  <- Index 11, index 7. Yes, (11, 7).
    ...
    ```

    Okay, coordinates are correct. `(3, 8), (6, 4), (6, 12), (9, 10), (11, 7)`.
    *   Col 10: Red at row 9. (1 only)
    *   Col 12: Red at row 6. (1 only)
*   This hypothesis *still* only produces the horizontal line on row 6. It doesn't explain the vertical green line in column 8 in the expected output.

What if the input grid for Example 1 in the prompt IS WRONG? What if the red pixel was actually at (11, 8)?
If reds were `(3, 8), (6, 4), (6, 12), (9, 10), (11, 8)`:
*   Hypothesis 1 (Connect Pairs):
    *   Pair (3, 8), (11, 8): Vert line col 8, rows 4..10.
    *   Pair (6, 4), (6, 12): Horiz line row 6, cols 5..11.
    *   Combined: Matches the Expected Output perfectly (assuming (9,10) is red).
*   Hypothesis 2 (Connect Min/Max in Row/Col):
    *   Row 6: Reds at 4, 12. Min=4, Max=12. Green row 6, cols 5..11.
    *   Col 8: Reds at 3, 11. Min=3, Max=11. Green col 8, rows 4..10.
    *   Combined: Also matches the Expected Output.

Given that the original code implements Hypothesis 1 (Connect Pairs) and failed because `np.argwhere` returned (11, 7) based on the *provided* input, it seems highly likely that the input grid for Example 1 shown in the prompt has a typo, and the pixel at (11, 7) should be at (11, 8). If that's true, the original code logic is *correct*, but it failed because the test harness used the incorrect input grid.

Let's check the other examples with Hypothesis 1 (Connect Pairs), assuming the inputs shown are correct.

Example 2:
*   Input Reds: `(2, 5), (6, 2), (7, 10), (10, 8), (12, 5)`
*   Aligned Pairs:
    *   (2, 5) and (12, 5): Vert line col 5, rows 3..11.
*   Expected Output Greens (visual inspection):
    *   Vert line col 5, rows 3..12 -> Matches pair (2,5), (12,5) except it goes up to row 12? No, output stops at row 11 (index 11). Line is rows 3-11. Matches.
    *   Horiz line row 7, cols 3..9. Connects (6,2)??? and (7,10)?? No. Expected output shows red at (6,2) and (7,10). This line connects them? How?
    *   Horiz line row 10, cols 6..7. Connects ??? and (10,8). Red at (10,8). What's the other end? Is it the vertical line's green pixel at (10,5)?
*   Let's re-examine Expected Output 2 carefully:
    
```
    ...
    6: 0 0 2 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Red(6,2), Green(6,3), Green(6,4), Green(6,5) ??? This row wasn't in my previous read!
    7: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 2 0  <- Green(7,5)...Green(7,9), Red(7,10)
    8: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Green(8,5)
    9: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Green(9,5)
   10: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 2 0 0 0  <- Green(10,5), Green(10,6), Green(10,7), Red(10,8)
   11: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Green(11,5)
   12: 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Red(12,5)
    ```

*   Okay, the vertical line from (2,5) to (12,5) generates greens at (r, 5) for r=3..11. This explains greens at (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (10,5), (11,5).
*   What pairs explain the other greens?
    *   Greens at (6,3), (6,4)? Red at (6,2). Is there another red on row 6? No.
    *   Greens at (7,6)..(7,9)? Red at (7,10). Is there another red on row 7? No.
    *   Greens at (10,6), (10,7)? Red at (10,8). Is there another red on row 10? No.
*   Hypothesis 1 (Connect Pairs) doesn't work for Example 2.
*   Hypothesis 2 (Connect Min/Max in Row/Col):
    *   Row 2: Red (2,5) -> 1 only.
    *   Row 6: Red (6,2) -> 1 only.
    *   Row 7: Red (7,10) -> 1 only.
    *   Row 10: Red (10,8) -> 1 only.
    *   Row 12: Red (12,5) -> 1 only.
    *   Col 2: Red (6,2) -> 1 only.
    *   Col 5: Reds (2,5), (12,5). Min=2, Max=12. Green col 5, rows 3..11. -> Matches *part* of output.
    *   Col 8: Red (10,8) -> 1 only.
    *   Col 10: Red (7,10) -> 1 only.
*   Hypothesis 2 also fails for Example 2.

Let's rethink. What if the green lines connect red pixels to *other green lines* if they are aligned?
Hypothesis 3:
1. Find all pairs of red pixels aligned horizontally or vertically.
2. Draw green lines between these pairs (exclusive of endpoints). Let the set of all pixels turned green be G.
3. Iterate: For each red pixel P=(r, c):
    a. Check horizontally: Find the closest green pixel G_h = (r, c') in set G on the same row r. If found, draw a green line between P and G_h (exclusive of P, inclusive/exclusive of G_h? Let's assume exclusive of both for now). Add these new green pixels to G.
    b. Check vertically: Find the closest green pixel G_v = (r', c) in set G on the same column c. If found, draw a green line between P and G_v. Add these new green pixels to G.
4. Repeat step 3 until no new green pixels can be added? Or just do step 3 once?

Let's try Hypothesis 3 (Connect Pairs, then connect Reds to Greens) on Example 2:
*   Reds: `(2, 5), (6, 2), (7, 10), (10, 8), (12, 5)`
*   Step 1 & 2: Pair (2, 5), (12, 5). Draw green at (r, 5) for r=3..11. Set G = {(3,5), (4,5), ..., (11,5)}.
*   Step 3 (Iteration 1):
    *   Red P=(6, 2):
        *   Horizontally: Closest green in G on row 6? G has (6,5). Distance = 3. Draw green between (6,2) and (6,5) -> (6,3), (6,4). Add to G. G now includes (6,3), (6,4).
        *   Vertically: Closest green in G on col 2? None.
    *   Red P=(7, 10):
        *   Horizontally: Closest green in G on row 7? G has (7,5). Distance = 5. Draw green between (7,10) and (7,5) -> (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6). Add to G. G now includes (7,6)..(7,9).
        *   Vertically: Closest green in G on col 10? None.
    *   Red P=(10, 8):
        *   Horizontally: Closest green in G on row 10? G has (10,5). Distance = 3. Draw green between (10,8) and (10,5) -> (10,7), (10,6). Add to G. G now includes (10,6), (10,7).
        *   Vertically: Closest green in G on col 8? None.
    *   Reds P=(2,5) and P=(12,5) already have adjacent green pixels in G. Closest green is distance 1, so no line is drawn between them.
*   Step 4: Stop.
*   Final Green Set G:
    *   (r, 5) for r=3..11 (from initial pair)
    *   (6, 3), (6, 4) (from P=(6,2))
    *   (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9) (from P=(7,10))
    *   (10, 6), (10, 7) (from P=(10,8))
*   Let's compare this to Expected Output 2 greens:
    *   (3,5)..(5,5) - Yes
    *   (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) - Yes
    *   (7,5)..(7,9) - Yes, (7,5) from vert line, (7,6..9) from horiz connection.
    *   (8,5) - Yes
    *   (9,5) - Yes
    *   (10,5)..(10,7) - Yes, (10,5) from vert line, (10,6..7) from horiz connection.
    *   (11,5) - Yes
*   This matches Example 2 perfectly!

Let's test Hypothesis 3 on Example 1 (using the *corrected* input reds: `(3, 8), (6, 4), (6, 12), (9, 10), (11, 8)`):
*   Step 1 & 2:
    *   Pair (3, 8), (11, 8): Vert line col 8, rows 4..10. G = {(4,8), ..., (10,8)}.
    *   Pair (6, 4), (6, 12): Horiz line row 6, cols 5..11. Add {(6,5), ..., (6,11)} to G.
*   Step 3 (Iteration 1):
    *   Red P=(9, 10):
        *   Horizontally: Closest green in G on row 9? G has (9,8). Distance=2. Draw green at (9,9). Add (9,9) to G.
        *   Vertically: Closest green in G on col 10? G has (6,10). Distance=3. Draw green at (7,10), (8,10). Add {(7,10), (8,10)} to G.
    *   Other reds (3,8), (11,8), (6,4), (6,12) are adjacent to existing green pixels.
*   Step 4: Stop.
*   Final Green Set G:
    *   (r, 8) for r=4..10
    *   (6, c) for c=5..11
    *   (9, 9)
    *   (7, 10), (8, 10)
*   Compare to Expected Output 1 (assuming corrected input and (9,10) is red):
    *   Expected Greens: (4..10, 8) and (6, 5..11).
    *   Hypothesis 3 predicts extra greens at (9,9), (7,10), (8,10). This does *not* match.

Maybe the connection in step 3 is not to the *closest* green, but only if there's a clear path? Or maybe step 3 doesn't happen?

Let's reconsider Example 2 Expected Output. Maybe the horizontal lines *don't* originate from the single red pixels.
*   Greens (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Red is (6,2). Could the line originate from the *intersection* of the vertical line at col 5? The vertical line passes through (6,5). Does the line extend left from (6,5) until it hits the red (6,2)? No, that would overwrite (6,2). It extends from (6,5) to (6,3).
*   Greens (7,6..9). Red is (7,10). Vertical line passes through (7,5). Does the line extend right from (7,5) until it hits (7,10)? No, it stops at (7,9).
*   Greens (10,6..7). Red is (10,8). Vertical line passes through (10,5). Does the line extend right from (10,5) until it hits (10,8)? No, it stops at (10,7).

Hypothesis 4:
1. Find all pairs of red pixels aligned horizontally or vertically.
2. Draw green lines between these pairs (exclusive of endpoints). Let the set of all pixels turned green be G. Let the set of original red pixels be R.
3. For every pixel P_g = (r, c) in G:
    a. Check horizontally: Look left and right from P_g along row r. If you encounter a red pixel P_r = (r, c_r) in R *before* encountering any other non-white pixel (or grid boundary), draw a green line between P_g and P_r (exclusive of both). Add new greens to G.
    b. Check vertically: Look up and down from P_g along column c. If you encounter a red pixel P_r = (r_r, c) in R *before* encountering any other non-white pixel (or grid boundary), draw a green line between P_g and P_r (exclusive of both). Add new greens to G.
4. Repeat Step 3 until no new greens are added? Or just once? Let's try just once.

Test Hypothesis 4 on Example 2:
*   Reds R: `{(2, 5), (6, 2), (7, 10), (10, 8), (12, 5)}`
*   Step 1 & 2: Pair (2, 5), (12, 5). G = {(r, 5) | r=3..11}.
*   Step 3: Iterate through pixels P_g in G.
    *   P_g = (3, 5): Look left/right/up/down. Find any reds before hitting boundary/other color? No.
    *   ...
    *   P_g = (6, 5):
        *   Horiz Left: Scan (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)... Hit red P_r=(6,2) at (6,2). Path (6,4), (6,3) is white. Draw green between (6,5) and (6,2) -> (6,4), (6,3). Add to G.
        *   Horiz Right: Scan (6,6)... boundary. No red.
        *   Vert Up/Down: Scan (5,5)... hit green. Scan (7,5)... hit green. No red.
    *   P_g = (7, 5):
        *   Horiz Left: Scan (7,4)... boundary. No red.
        *   Horiz Right: Scan (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (7,10)... Hit red P_r=(7,10) at (7,10). Path (7,6)..(7,9) is white. Draw green between (7,5) and (7,10) -> (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). Add to G.
        *   Vert Up/Down: Hit green. No red.
    *   ...
    *   P_g = (10, 5):
        *   Horiz Left: Boundary. No red.
        *   Horiz Right: Scan (10,6), (10,7), (10,8)... Hit red P_r=(10,8) at (10,8). Path (10,6), (10,7) is white. Draw green between (10,5) and (10,8) -> (10,6), (10,7). Add to G.
        *   Vert Up/Down: Hit green. No red.
    *   ...
*   Final Green Set G:
    *   (r, 5) for r=3..11
    *   (6, 3), (6, 4)
    *   (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9)
    *   (10, 6), (10, 7)
*   This matches Example 2 perfectly!

Test Hypothesis 4 on Example 1 (assuming corrected input `(3, 8), (6, 4), (6, 12), (9, 10), (11, 8)`):
*   Reds R: `{(3, 8), (6, 4), (6, 12), (9, 10), (11, 8)}`
*   Step 1 & 2:
    *   Pair (3, 8), (11, 8): G1 = {(r, 8) | r=4..10}.
    *   Pair (6, 4), (6, 12): G2 = {(6, c) | c=5..11}.
    *   Initial G = G1 U G2.
*   Step 3: Iterate through pixels P_g in G.
    *   P_g = (4, 8): Look around. No reds nearby on clear path.
    *   ...
    *   P_g = (6, 8) (intersection):
        *   Horiz Left: Scan (6,7).. Hit G. Scan (6,9).. Hit G.
        *   Vert Up: Scan (5,8).. Hit G. Vert Down: Scan (7,8).. Hit G. No reds found.
    *   P_g = (6, 10):
        *   Horiz Left: Hit G. Horiz Right: Hit G.
        *   Vert Up: Scan (5,10).. boundary.
        *   Vert Down: Scan (7,10), (8,10), (9,10)... Hit red P_r=(9,10). Path (7,10), (8,10) is white. Draw green between (6,10) and (9,10) -> (7,10), (8,10). Add to G.
    *   P_g = (9, 8):
        *   Horiz Left: Boundary.
        *   Horiz Right: Scan (9,9), (9,10)... Hit red P_r=(9,10). Path (9,9) is white. Draw green between (9,8) and (9,10) -> (9,9). Add to G.
        *   Vert Up/Down: Hit G.
*   Final Green Set G:
    *   (r, 8) for r=4..10
    *   (6, c) for c=5..11
    *   (7, 10), (8, 10) (from P_g=(6,10))
    *   (9, 9) (from P_g=(9,8))
*   This *still* predicts extra green pixels compared to the expected output for Example 1.

Let's revisit the Example 1 Input/Output pair, using the grid *as provided in the prompt*, even though it seems weird.
Input Reds: `(3, 8), (6, 4), (6, 12), (9, 10), (11, 7)`
Expected Output:
Red: `(3, 8), (6, 4), (6, 12), (9, 10), (11, 8)` <-- Output has red at (11,8) not (11,7)!
Green: `(4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 5..11), (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8), (10, 8)`
Observation: The red pixel at (11, 7) in the input seems to *move* to (11, 8) in the output, AND it participates in forming the vertical green line. This suggests the transformation isn't just adding green lines.

Could the rule be:
1. Identify "misaligned" red pixels? A red pixel is misaligned if it doesn't have another red pixel in the same row or column.
2. "Snap" misaligned red pixels to the nearest row/column that *does* contain multiple red pixels?
3. *Then* connect the (potentially moved) red pixels?

Let's re-examine Example 1 with this "snapping" idea.
Input Reds: `(3, 8), (6, 4), (6, 12), (9, 10), (11, 7)`
*   Row 6 has 2 reds: (6,4), (6,12). These are 'aligned'.
*   Red (3,8): Column 8 has only one red. Row 3 has only one red. -> Misaligned?
*   Red (9,10): Column 10 has only one red. Row 9 has only one red. -> Misaligned?
*   Red (11,7): Column 7 has only one red. Row 11 has only one red. -> Misaligned?
*   Which rows/columns have multiple reds? Only Row 6. This doesn't help snapping.

Let's reconsider the *output* grid structure.
Example 1 Output: Vertical line col 8, Horizontal line row 6. They intersect. All endpoints are red: (3,8), (11,8), (6,4), (6,12). There's also a red at (9,10) that seems unconnected.
Example 2 Output: Vertical line col 5, endpoints (2,5), (12,5). Horizontal lines branching off: row 6 from (6,5) to (6,3) ending near red (6,2); row 7 from (7,5) to (7,9) ending near red (7,10); row 10 from (10,5) to (10,7) ending near red (10,8).

Maybe the lines are drawn differently.
Hypothesis 5: Treat the grid like a circuit or pathfinding problem.
1. Identify all red pixels.
2. For each row `r`, find all red pixels `(r, c1), (r, c2), ...`. If there are >= 2, draw horizontal green lines connecting all adjacent pairs in that row. E.g., if reds are at cols 2, 5, 9, draw lines 3-4 and 6-8.
3. For each column `c`, find all red pixels `(r1, c), (r2, c), ...`. If there are >= 2, draw vertical green lines connecting all adjacent pairs in that column. E.g., if reds are at rows 1, 6, 7, draw lines 2-5 and line at 7? No, connect adjacent pairs: line 2-5, line 7-7 (no line). Connect min/max? Or connect all consecutive pairs? Let's try min/max first. If reds at rows 1, 6, 7, connect 1 and 7 -> green lines rows 2-5.
Let's refine:
Hypothesis 5a:
1. Find all red pixels.
2. For each row `r`, find all red pixels `R_r = {(r, c) | input[r,c]==2}`. If `len(R_r) >= 2`, find `c_min = min(c for r,c in R_r)` and `c_max = max(c for r,c in R_r)`. Draw green line `output[r, c] = 3` for `c` from `c_min + 1` to `c_max - 1`.
3. For each col `c`, find all red pixels `R_c = {(r, c) | input[r,c]==2}`. If `len(R_c) >= 2`, find `r_min = min(r for r,c in R_c)` and `r_max = max(r for r,c in R_c)`. Draw green line `output[r, c] = 3` for `r` from `r_min + 1` to `r_max - 1`.
4. Overwrite happens: if a pixel is made green by both row and column rules, it stays green. Original red pixels remain red.

Test Hypothesis 5a on Example 1 (using original input reds `(3, 8), (6, 4), (6, 12), (9, 10), (11, 7)`)
*   Rows:
    *   Row 6: Reds at 4, 12. Min=4, Max=12. Green row 6, cols 5..11.
*   Cols:
    *   Col 4: Red at 6. (1 only)
    *   Col 7: Red at 11. (1 only)
    *   Col 8: Red at 3. (1 only)
    *   Col 10: Red at 9. (1 only)
    *   Col 12: Red at 6. (1 only)
*   Result: Only horizontal line on row 6. Fails.

Test Hypothesis 5a on Example 2 (reds `(2, 5), (6, 2), (7, 10), (10, 8), (12, 5)`)
*   Rows: None have >= 2 reds.
*   Cols:
    *   Col 5: Reds at 2, 12. Min=2, Max=12. Green col 5, rows 3..11.
*   Result: Only vertical line on col 5. Fails.

It seems the lines need to interact or branch. The original "connect all pairs" logic (Hypothesis 1) seemed promising for Example 1 *if* the input was corrected. Let's re-evaluate the code failure.

The `code_output` shows that the loop correctly identified the horizontal
