Let me re-examine the input grid for Example 1 visually.\n\nInput Ex 1:\nRow 3: ... 2 ... -> (3, 8) - Correct\nRow 6: ... 2 ... 2 -> (6, 4), (6, 12) - Correct\nRow 9: ... 2 ... -> (9, 10) - Correct\nRow 11: ... 2 ... -> (11, 7) - **INCORRECT**. The input grid clearly shows `2` at index 7 (8th column) for row index 11.\n`[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` <- Row 11\n\nWhy did `np.argwhere` give (11, 7)? Maybe there was a typo when the input grid was copied into the tool code block? Let me re-copy from the prompt.\nInput Grid Ex 1 from prompt:\nRow 11 (index 11): `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0` -> The 2 is at index 7.\nWait, indexing. Python lists are 0-indexed. `np.argwhere` returns `(row_index, column_index)`.\nRow 0\nRow 1\nRow 2\nRow 3: ... 2 ... (col 8) -> index (3, 8)\n...\nRow 6: ... 2 ... (col 4), ... 2 (col 12) -> index (6, 4), (6, 12)\n...\nRow 9: ... 2 ... (col 10) -> index (9, 10)\n...\nRow 11: ... 2 ... (col 7) -> index (11, 7)\n\nAh, I was misreading the grid viewer/prompt earlier. The red pixel IS at (11, 7).\nSo the red pixels are indeed `(3, 8), (6, 4), (6, 12), (9, 10), (11, 7)`.\n\nNow, let's re-check the expected output for Example 1 based on these coordinates and the \"connect aligned pairs\" hypothesis.\n*   Red pixels: `(3, 8), (6, 4), (6, 12), (9, 10), (11, 7)`\n*   Aligned pairs:\n    *   Row 6: (6, 4) and (6, 12). Connect with green from col 5 to 11.\n    *   Any others?\n        *   (3, 8) aligns with nothing.\n        *   (9, 10) aligns with nothing.\n        *   (11, 7) aligns with nothing.\n*   This hypothesis only produces the horizontal line on row 6. This matches the *code's output* but *not* the *expected output*.\n\nLet's reconsider the expected output's green pixels (assuming my corrected reading that (9,10) is RED, not green):\nGreen: (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 5..11), (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8), (10, 8)\nThis implies a vertical line in col 8 from row 4 to row 10, and a horizontal line in row 6 from col 5 to col 11.\nThe horizontal line comes from (6, 4) and (6, 12).\nWhere does the vertical line come from? It spans rows 4 to 10. The red pixels nearby are (3, 8) and... nothing else in column 8. The next red pixel vertically is (11, 7) - wrong column.\n\nThere must be a flaw in my understanding or reading.\nLet's look at Example 2.\nInput Reds: (2, 5), (6, 2), (7, 10), (10, 8), (12, 5)\nExpected Output Greens imply:\n*   Vertical line col 5, rows 3-12 (connecting (2,5) and (12,5))\n*   Horizontal line row 7, cols 3-9 (connecting (6,2) ??? and (7,10) ???) -> No, this line seems to connect (6,2) and (7,10). But they are not aligned.\n*   Horizontal line row 10, cols 6-7 (connecting (10,5)?? and (10,8)) -> Green pixels are at (10,6), (10,7). Red is at (10,8). Where is the other end? Is it the vertical line at (10,5)?\n\nLet's try a different hypothesis:\nMaybe it's not about *pairs*. Maybe it's about *sets* of aligned pixels.\nHypothesis 2: For each row and each column, find all red pixels. If there are 2 or more, draw a green line between the minimum and maximum coordinate red pixels in that row/column.\n\nTest Hypothesis 2 on Example 1:\n*   Reds: `(3, 8), (6, 4), (6, 12), (9, 10), (11, 7)`\n*   Rows:\n    *   Row 6: Reds at col 4, 12. Min=4, Max=12. Draw green row 6, cols 5..11. -> Matches output.\n*   Columns:\n    *   Col 4: Red at row 6. (1 only)\n    *   Col 7: Red at row 11. (1 only)\n    *   Col 8: Red at row 3. (1 only) -> Wait, I misread input again? Row 11, Col 8 is red? Let me look *really* carefully.\n    "

Or maybe step 3 doesn't happen?\n\nLet's reconsider Example 2 Expected Output. Maybe the horizontal lines *don't* originate from the single red pixels.\n*   Greens (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Red is (6,2). Could the line originate from the *intersection* of the vertical line at col 5? The vertical line passes through (6,5). Does the line extend left from (6,5) until it hits the red (6,2)? No, that would overwrite (6,2). It extends from (6,5) to (6,3).\n*   Greens (7,6..9). Red is (7,10). Vertical line passes through (7,5). Does the line extend right from (7,5) until it hits (7,10)? No, it stops at (7,9).\n*   Greens (10,6..7). Red is (10,8). Vertical line passes through (10,5). Does the line extend right from (10,5) until it hits (10,8)?

Let the set of all pixels turned green be G. Let the set of original red pixels be R.\n3. For every pixel P_g = (r, c) in G:\n    a. Check horizontally: Look left and right from P_g along row r. If you encounter a red pixel P_r = (r, c_r) in R *before* encountering any other non-white pixel (or grid boundary), draw a green line between P_g and P_r (exclusive of both). Add new greens to G.\n    b. Check vertically: Look up and down from P_g along column c. If you encounter a red pixel P_r = (r_r, c) in R *before* encountering any other non-white pixel (or grid boundary), draw a green line between P_g and P_r (exclusive of both).

Row 9 has only one red. -> Misaligned?\n*   Red (11,7): Column 7 has only one red. Row 11 has only one red. -> Misaligned?\n*   Which rows/columns have multiple reds? Only Row 6. This doesn't help snapping.\n\nLet's reconsider the *output* grid structure.\nExample 1 Output: Vertical line col 8, Horizontal line row 6. They intersect. All endpoints are red: (3,8), (11,8), (6,4), (6,12). There's also a red at (9,10) that seems unconnected.\nExample 2 Output: Vertical line col 5, endpoints (2,5), (12,5). Horizontal lines branching off: row 6 from (6,5) to (6,3) ending near red (6,2); row 7 from (7,5) to (7,9) ending near red (7,10); row 10 from (10,5) to (10,7) ending near red (10,8).\n\nMaybe the lines are drawn differently.\nHypothesis 5: Treat the grid like a circuit or pathfinding problem.\n1. Identify all red pixels.\n2. For each row `r`, find all red pixels `(r, c1), (r, c2), ...`. If there are >= 2, draw horizontal green lines connecting all adjacent pairs in that row. E.g., if reds are at cols 2, 5, 9, draw lines 3-4 and 6-8.\n3. For each column `c`, find all red pixels `(r1, c), (r2, c), ...`. If there are >= 2, draw vertical green lines connecting all adjacent pairs in that column. E.g., if reds are at rows 1, 6, 7, draw lines 2-5 and line at 7? No, connect adjacent pairs: line 2-5, line 7-7 (no line). Connect min/max? Or connect all consecutive pairs? Let's try min/max first. If reds at rows 1, 6, 7, connect 1 and 7 -> green lines rows 2-5.\nLet's refine:\nHypothesis 5a:\n1. Find all red pixels.\n2. For each row `r`, find all red pixels `R_r = {(r, c) | input[r,c]==2}`. If `len(R_r) >= 2`, find `c_min = min(c for r,c in R_r)` and `c_max = max(c for r,c in R_r)`. Draw green line `output[r, c] = 3` for `c` from `c_min + 1` to `c_max - 1`.\n3. For each col `c`, find all red pixels `R_c = {(r, c) | input[r,c]==2}`. If `len(R_c) >= 2`, find `r_min = min(r for r,c in R_c)` and `r_max = max(r for r,c in R_c)`. Draw green line `output[r, c] = 3` for `r` from `r_min + 1` to `r_max - 1`.\n4. Overwrite happens: if a pixel is made green by both row and column rules, it stays green. Original red pixels remain red.\n\nTest Hypothesis 5a on Example 1 (using original input reds `(3, 8), (6, 4), (6, 12), (9, 10), (11, 7)`)\n*   Rows:\n    *   Row 6: Reds at 4, 12. Min=4, Max=12. Green row 6, cols 5..11.\n*   Cols:\n    *   Col 4: Red at 6. (1 only)\n    *   Col 7: Red at 11. (1 only)\n    *   Col 8: Red at 3. (1 only)\n    *   Col 10: Red at 9. (1 only)\n    *   Col 12: Red at 6. (1 only)\n*   Result: Only horizontal line on row 6. Fails.\n\nTest Hypothesis 5a on Example 2 (reds `(2, 5), (6, 2), (7, 10), (10, 8), (12, 5)`)\n*   Rows: None have >= 2 reds.\n*   Cols:\n    *   Col 5: Reds at 2, 12. Min=2, Max=12. Green col 5, rows 3..11.\n*   Result: Only vertical line on col 5. Fails.\n\nIt seems the lines need to interact or branch. The original \"connect all pairs\" logic (Hypothesis 1) seemed promising for Example 1 *if* the input was corrected. Let's re-evaluate the code failure.\n\nThe `code_output` shows that the loop correctly identified the horizontal"
