Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 10x10 grid. The background is consistently white (0).
2.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains a single, distinct object. This object is always a 3x3 shape composed of a single non-white color (Azure=8, Yellow=4, or Magenta=6) forming a hollow square (the center pixel is white).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the object within the grid. The object's shape and color remain unchanged.
4.  **Movement Pattern:** The direction the object moves seems to depend entirely on its color:
    *   Azure (8) objects always move horizontally to the far right of the grid.
    *   Yellow (4) objects always move vertically to the very bottom of the grid.
    *   Magenta (6) objects always move vertically to the very top of the grid.
5.  **Final State:** In the output grid, the object is positioned such that one of its edges aligns perfectly with the corresponding edge of the grid (right edge for Azure, bottom edge for Yellow, top edge for Magenta). The rest of the grid remains white.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Size: 10x10 (consistent across all examples)
  Background: White (0)
Object:
  Count: 1 per grid
  Shape: 3x3 hollow square (non-white border, white center)
  Colors_Used:
    - Azure (8)
    - Yellow (4)
    - Magenta (6)
  Integrity: Shape and color remain unchanged during transformation.
Transformation:
  Type: Translation (movement)
  Target: Move the object to a grid boundary.
  Rule_Determinant: Object color
  Color_Rules:
    - Color: Azure (8)
      Action: Translate object horizontally
      Destination: Align object's right edge with the grid's right edge.
    - Color: Yellow (4)
      Action: Translate object vertically
      Destination: Align object's bottom edge with the grid's bottom edge.
    - Color: Magenta (6)
      Action: Translate object vertically
      Destination: Align object's top edge with the grid's top edge.
Output_Grid:
  Size: Same as input (10x10)
  Content: White background with the single object translated to its new position based on its color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single connected block of non-white pixels in the input grid (this is the object). Determine its color and its bounding box (the smallest rectangle containing all its non-white pixels).
2.  Determine the translation direction based solely on the object's color:
    *   If the object's color is Azure (8), the target position is such that the object's right edge aligns with the grid's right edge, maintaining its original row position relative to its bounding box.
    *   If the object's color is Yellow (4), the target position is such that the object's bottom edge aligns with the grid's bottom edge, maintaining its original column position relative to its bounding box.
    *   If the object's color is Magenta (6), the target position is such that the object's top edge aligns with the grid's top edge (row 0), maintaining its original column position relative to its bounding box.
3.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Copy the original object (preserving its internal structure, including the white center) to the calculated target position on the new grid.
5.  The resulting grid is the output.
