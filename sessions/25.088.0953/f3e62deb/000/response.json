            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 10x10 grid. The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains a single, distinct object. This object is always a 3x3 shape composed of a single non-white color (Azure=8, Yellow=4, or Magenta=6) forming a hollow square (the center pixel is white).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the object within the grid. The object's shape and color remain unchanged.\n4.  **Movement Pattern:** The direction the object moves seems to depend entirely on its color:\n    *   Azure (8) objects always move horizontally to the far right of the grid.\n    *   Yellow (4) objects always move vertically to the very bottom of the grid.\n    *   Magenta (6) objects always move vertically to the very top of the grid.\n5.  **Final State:** In the output grid, the object is positioned such that one of its edges aligns perfectly with the corresponding edge of the grid (right edge for Azure, bottom edge for Yellow, top edge for Magenta). The rest of the grid remains white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Determine its color and its bounding box (the smallest rectangle containing all its non-white pixels).\n2.  Determine the translation direction based solely on the object's color:\n    *   If the object's color is Azure (8), the target position is such that the object's right edge aligns with the grid's right edge, maintaining its original row position relative to its bounding box.\n    *   If the object's color is Yellow (4), the target position is such that the object's bottom edge aligns with the grid's bottom edge, maintaining its original column position relative to its bounding box.\n    *   If the object's color is Magenta (6), the target position is such that the object's top edge aligns with the grid's top edge (row 0), maintaining its original column position relative to its bounding box.\n3.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n4.  Copy the original object (preserving its internal structure, including the white center) to the calculated target position on the new grid.\n5.  The resulting grid is the output."
