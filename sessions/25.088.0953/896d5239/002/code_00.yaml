task_description: Fill enclosed regions with azure, keeping barriers intact.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: variable height and width (up to 30x30)
  - background_color: white (0) is common but not exclusive.
  - barrier_color: green (3)
  - fill_color: azure (8)
objects:
  - type: barrier
    color: green (3)
    properties:
      - Forms contiguous lines or shapes.
      - May connect to the grid border or form closed loops.
      - Persist unchanged in the output.
  - type: enclosed_pixel
    color: any color except green (3)
    properties:
      - Located in regions separated from the border by green barriers.
      - Changed to azure (8) in the output.
  - type: outside_pixel
    color: any color except green (3)
    properties:
      - Reachable from the grid border without crossing green barriers (using some definition of reachability).
      - Retain their original color in the output.
actions:
  - action: identify_outside_region
    using: BFS (or similar) starting from border pixels.
    constraints:
      - Movement is orthogonal.
      - Cannot move into green (3) pixels.
      - # Initial hypothesis: Cannot move diagonally across two adjacent green pixels (corner-blocking). (This hypothesis failed)
      - # Current finding: Standard BFS reaches ALL non-green pixels.
  - action: identify_enclosed_pixels
    definition: Non-green pixels NOT part of the identified outside region.
    # Problem: With standard BFS, this set is empty.
  - action: fill_enclosed_pixels
    target: enclosed_pixels
    new_color: azure (8)
observations:
  - The definition of 'reachability' or 'outside' used by the task is different from a standard BFS from all border points avoiding green cells.
  - Visually, the areas filled with azure appear 'inside' green loops or areas walled off by green lines connecting to the border.
  - The previous code correctly identified the intended *outcome* (fill enclosed areas) but failed because its method for identifying 'enclosed' (unreachable via standard BFS) did not match the task's implicit definition.
