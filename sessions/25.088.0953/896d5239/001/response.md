"""
Transforms the input grid based on reachability from the border, avoiding green barriers.

1. Identify all green pixels (color 3) as barriers.
2. Perform a reachability search (like Breadth-First Search or Flood Fill) starting 
   from all non-green pixels located on the outer border of the grid.
3. The search can move horizontally and vertically to adjacent cells but cannot 
   enter or cross any green (3) pixel.
4. Mark all pixels reachable from the border during this search.
5. Create the output grid:
   - Pixels that are green (3) in the input remain green (3) in the output.
   - Non-green pixels that were reached by the search keep their original color from the input.
   - Non-green pixels that were *not* reached by the search are changed to azure (8) in the output.
