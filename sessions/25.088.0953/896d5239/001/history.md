Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 2D grids of varying dimensions.
2.  **Colors:** The key colors involved are `white` (0), `blue` (1), and `green` (3) in the input. The output introduces `azure` (8). Other colors might be present but don't seem directly involved in the core transformation logic observed in the examples.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, except that some `white` (0) and `blue` (1) pixels are changed to `azure` (8).
4.  **Role of Green (3):** Green pixels appear to act as static boundaries or walls. They are never changed in the output.
5.  **Role of Azure (8):** Azure appears in specific regions. Comparing input and output, these regions correspond to areas in the input containing `white` (0) or `blue` (1) pixels that seem "enclosed" or "contained" by the green (3) pixels.
6.  **Defining "Enclosed":** A pixel seems to be "enclosed" if it cannot reach the outer border of the grid by moving horizontally or vertically without crossing a green (3) pixel. Pixels that *can* reach the border without crossing green remain unchanged (unless they are green themselves, which also remain unchanged).

**Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - height: variable (e.g., 13, 15)
      - width: variable (e.g., 12, 16)
  - type: color
    values:
      - input: white (0), blue (1), green (3), potentially others
      - output: white (0), blue (1), green (3), azure (8), potentially others
  - type: region
    properties:
      - defined_by: green (3) pixels acting as boundaries
      - types:
          - exterior: pixels reachable from the grid border without crossing green (3)
          - interior: pixels not reachable from the grid border due to green (3) boundaries

actions:
  - name: identify_boundaries
    input: input grid
    output: location of all green (3) pixels
  - name: identify_exterior_pixels
    input: input grid, green boundaries
    method: Perform a reachability search (like flood fill, BFS, or DFS) starting from all non-green border pixels. The search cannot cross green pixels.
    output: set of coordinates corresponding to reachable (exterior) pixels
  - name: recolor_interior
    input: input grid, set of exterior pixel coordinates
    output: output grid
    process:
      - Iterate through all pixels in the input grid.
      - If a pixel is green (3), keep it green (3) in the output.
      - If a pixel's coordinates are in the set of exterior pixels, keep its original color in the output.
      - If a pixel is NOT green (3) and its coordinates are NOT in the set of exterior pixels (i.e., it's an interior pixel), change its color to azure (8) in the output.

relationships:
  - green (3) pixels act as barriers to a reachability search starting from the grid border.
  - The final color of a non-green pixel depends on its reachability from the border. Reachable pixels keep their original color; unreachable pixels become azure (8).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all green pixels (color 3) in the input grid; these act as fixed barriers.
2.  Identify all pixels located on the outer border (edge) of the grid.
3.  Perform a flood fill (or similar reachability search) starting from every border pixel that is *not* green.
4.  This flood fill can move horizontally and vertically to adjacent cells but cannot enter or cross any green pixel.
5.  Keep track of all pixels visited/reached by this flood fill. These are the "exterior" pixels.
6.  Create the output grid based on the following rules for each pixel position:
    a.  If the pixel in the input grid is green (3), copy the green pixel to the output grid.
    b.  If the pixel was reached by the flood fill (is an "exterior" pixel), copy its original color from the input grid to the output grid.
    c.  If the pixel is *not* green (3) and was *not* reached by the flood fill (is an "interior" pixel), set the pixel in the output grid to azure (8).
7.  The resulting grid is the final output.
