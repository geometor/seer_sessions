Green pixels (color 3) act as barriers and \nremain unchanged.\n\n1.  Define Barriers: Green pixels (color 3) are barriers and remain unchanged.\n2.  Identify Connected Components: Find contiguous regions of non-green pixels \n    using 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).\n3.  Check Border Adjacency: For each non-green component, determine if any pixel \n    within it lies on the grid's outer border (first/last row or first/last column).\n4.  Fill Enclosed Regions: If a non-green component does *not* touch the border, \n    change the color of all pixels within that component to azure (8).\n5.  Construct Output: Create the output grid where:\n    - Green (3) pixels keep their color.\n    - Non-green pixels in border-adjacent regions keep their original color.\n    - Non-green pixels in non-border-adjacent (enclosed) regions are changed to azure (8).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a list of lists of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to a NumPy array for easier manipulation and access to shape\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    \n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    # Pixels will be overwritten only if they are in an enclosed region.\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n\n    # Define barrier color and the color to fill enclosed areas\n    barrier_color = 3\n    fill_color = 8\n\n    # Keep track of visited cells during component finding to avoid redundant searches\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check if the cell is non-barrier and hasn't been visited as part of a component yet\n            if grid[r, c] != barrier_color and not visited[r, c]:\n                # Found the start of a potential new non-barrier component\n                component_coords = set()\n                touches_border = False\n                queue = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True # Mark the starting cell as visited\n\n                # Perform BFS to find the entire connected component\n                while queue:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = queue.popleft()\n                    component_coords.add((curr_r, curr_c))\n\n                    # Check if the current cell is on the border\n                    if curr_r == 0 or curr_r == height - 1 or curr_c == 0 or curr_c == width - 1:\n                        touches_border = True\n\n                    # Explore neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n\n                        # Check if the neighbor is within grid bounds\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                            # Check if the neighbor is part of the component (not a barrier) \n                            # and has not been visited yet\n                            if grid[nr, nc] != barrier_color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                                # Mark as visited and add to the queue to explore\n                                visited[nr, nc] = True\n                                queue.append((nr, nc))\n                \n                # After exploring the entire component, check if it touched the border\n                if not touches_border:\n                    # If the component did not touch the border, fill it with the fill_color\n                    for comp_r, comp_c in component_coords:\n                        output_grid[comp_r, comp_c] = fill_color\n                # Else (component touched the border), do nothing, pixels keep original color (already copied)\n\n    # Convert the result back to a standard list of lists format\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
