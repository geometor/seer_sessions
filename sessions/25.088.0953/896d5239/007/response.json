These \nenclosed regions are filled with azure (color 8). Green pixels act as barriers \nand remain unchanged. Other non-green pixels not part of an enclosed region also \nremain unchanged.\n\nThe logic uses a flood fill approach starting from the border:\n1. Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input.\n2. Initialize a 'reached' grid to track pixels connected to the border.\n3. Create a queue and add all non-green pixels located on the grid's border \n   to it. Mark these border pixels as 'reached'.\n4. Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the pixels in the queue:\n    a. Dequeue a pixel.\n    b. Explore its 4-way adjacent neighbors.\n    c. If a neighbor is within bounds, is not green (barrier), and has not \n       been reached yet, mark it as 'reached' and add it to the queue.\n5. After the BFS completes, all non-green pixels connected to the border (without \n   crossing a green barrier) will be marked as 'reached'.\n6. Iterate through the entire grid:\n    a. If a pixel is not green and was *not* marked as 'reached', it belongs \n       to an enclosed region.\n    b. Change the color of such enclosed pixels in the output grid to azure (8).\n7.
