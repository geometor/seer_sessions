elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - height: variable (e.g., 13, 15)
      - width: variable (e.g., 12, 16)
  - type: color
    values:
      - input: white (0), blue (1), green (3), potentially others
      - output: white (0), blue (1), green (3), azure (8), potentially others
  - type: region
    properties:
      - defined_by: green (3) pixels acting as boundaries
      - types:
          - exterior: pixels reachable from the grid border without crossing green (3)
          - interior: pixels not reachable from the grid border due to green (3) boundaries

actions:
  - name: identify_boundaries
    input: input grid
    output: location of all green (3) pixels
  - name: identify_exterior_pixels
    input: input grid, green boundaries
    method: Perform a reachability search (like flood fill, BFS, or DFS) starting from all non-green border pixels. The search cannot cross green pixels.
    output: set of coordinates corresponding to reachable (exterior) pixels
  - name: recolor_interior
    input: input grid, set of exterior pixel coordinates
    output: output grid
    process:
      - Iterate through all pixels in the input grid.
      - If a pixel is green (3), keep it green (3) in the output.
      - If a pixel's coordinates are in the set of exterior pixels, keep its original color in the output.
      - If a pixel is NOT green (3) and its coordinates are NOT in the set of exterior pixels (i.e., it's an interior pixel), change its color to azure (8) in the output.

relationships:
  - green (3) pixels act as barriers to a reachability search starting from the grid border.
  - The final color of a non-green pixel depends on its reachability from the border. Reachable pixels keep their original color; unreachable pixels become azure (8).
