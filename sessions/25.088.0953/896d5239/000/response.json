The output introduces `azure` (8). Other colors might be present but don't seem directly involved in the core transformation logic observed in the examples.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, except that some `white` (0) and `blue` (1) pixels are changed to `azure` (8).\n4.  **Role of Green (3):** Green pixels appear to act as static boundaries or walls. They are never changed in the output.\n5.  **Role of Azure (8):** Azure appears in specific regions. Comparing input and output, these regions correspond to areas in the input containing `white` (0) or `blue` (1) pixels that seem \"enclosed\" or \"contained\" by the green (3) pixels.\n6.  **Defining \"Enclosed\":** A pixel seems to be \"enclosed\" if it cannot reach the outer border of the grid by moving horizontally or vertically without crossing a green (3) pixel. Pixels that *can* reach the border without crossing green remain unchanged (unless they are green themselves, which also remain unchanged).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
