"""
Transforms the input grid based on reachability from the border, avoiding green barriers.

1. Identify all green pixels (color 3) as barriers.
2. Perform a reachability search (like Breadth-First Search or Flood Fill) starting 
   from all non-green pixels located on the outer border of the grid.
3. The search can move horizontally and vertically to adjacent cells but cannot 
   enter or cross any green (3) pixel.
4. Mark all pixels reachable from the border during this search.
5. Create the output grid:
   - Pixels that are green (3) in the input remain green (3) in the output.
   - Non-green pixels that were reached by the search keep their original color from the input.
   - Non-green pixels that were *not* reached by the search are changed to azure (8) in the output.

**Confirmation:** The code execution confirms that the BFS, as implemented in the original Python code, finds *zero* unreachable non-barrier cells for all three examples. This means the BFS starting from the border *does* reach every non-green cell.

This contradicts the visual interpretation and the expected output. The transformation rule must be different from "fill non-green cells unreachable from the border via orthogonal paths not crossing green barriers".

**Revisiting Hypotheses:**

1.  **Diagonal Movement/Connection?** ARC sometimes involves diagonal connections. If the BFS could move diagonally, or if green pixels also blocked diagonal movement, would that change things?
    *   If BFS *could* move diagonally: It would reach even *more* cells, making the problem worse.
    *   If green *blocked* diagonally: This might create enclosed areas. Let's try modifying the BFS check.
        *   A cell `(r, c)` is blocked if `grid[r, c] == 3`.
        *   A move from `(r, c)` to `(nr, nc)` is blocked if `grid[nr, nc] == 3`. This is already handled.
        *   What if diagonal adjacency to green matters? E.g., a cell `(r, c)` is considered "blocked" or part of the barrier if it's diagonally adjacent to a green cell? This seems unlikely.
        *   What if the *path* cannot pass diagonally adjacent to a green cell? Example: moving from (0,0) to (1,1). Is this blocked if (0,1) or (1,0) is green? This is sometimes called the "8-connectivity vs 4-connectivity" issue in image processing flood fills. The current BFS uses 4-connectivity (orthogonal moves). The *barriers* might need to be considered with 8-connectivity.

2.  **Definition of "Border"?** What if the "outside" isn't the grid edge, but something else? Perhaps the largest contiguous area of a specific color (like white=0) that touches the border?
    *   Let's test this on Example 1. The largest border-touching white area seems to encompass most of the grid except the enclosed areas. If BFS starts *only* from these white border cells?

    # This means BFS reached all non-green pixels.

    # This situation is common if there's a "leak" in the barrier.
    # Let's visually inspect the green barriers VERY carefully in Example 1.
    # Green pixels: (2,4), (3,3), (3,5), (4,2), (4,6), (8,5), (9,4), (9,6), (10,3), (10,6), (11,2), (12,2)
    # Are there any 1-pixel gaps? No.
    # Are there diagonal gaps? Yes, e.g., between (3,3) and (4,2). A path could go (3,2) -> (4,3).
    # Does the BFS algorithm prevent diagonal "leaks"?
    # BFS uses orthogonal moves only: (0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0).
    # Consider a 2x2 square:
    # A B
    # C D
    # If B and C are barriers (green), can BFS go from A to D?
    # A -> B (blocked)
    # A -> C (blocked)
    # Assume A is reachable. Queue has A. Pop A. Check neighbors.
    # Can't reach B or C. Can potentially reach neighbors outside this square.
    # Can D be reached? Only via its other neighbors.
    # Standard 4-neighbor BFS does NOT leak diagonally through barriers.

    # FINAL HYPOTHESIS: The problem isn't reachability from the *border*, but reachability from a *specific color* that represents the "outside". White (0) is the most common background. Let's assume the "outside" is the connected component of white (0) pixels that touches the border. Any non-green, non-white cell enclosed by green OR reachable only through non-white cells should be filled? This is getting complex.

    # Let's go back to the simplest interpretation:
    # 1. Green (3) is a barrier.
    # 2. Find all cells reachable from the border via orthogonal steps without crossing green.
    # 3. Cells that are NOT green and NOT reachable are filled with azure (8).
    # The code implements this. The code execution shows NO cells are unreachable.
    # This implies that for *every single non-green cell* in the input grids, there exists *at least one path* from *at least one border cell* to it, using only orthogonal steps and not passing *through* a green cell.

    # Could there be an error in my understanding of the expected outputs?
    # Ex 1: Expected azure at (3,4). Input is 1. Neighbors: (2,4)=3, (4,4)=1, (3,3)=3, (3,5)=3. Looks enclosed.
    # Path found earlier: (0,0)=0 -> ... -> (5,3)=1 -> (5,4)=1 -> (4,4)=1 -> (3,4)=1. This path is valid according to the rules.

    # WHY IS (3,4) EXPECTED TO BE AZURE IF IT'S REACHABLE?
    # Possibility 1: The "barrier" isn't just green. Maybe certain *shapes* of green block differently? No, ARC usually uses color value.
    # Possibility 2: "Reachability" is defined differently. Maybe only paths of a certain color? (Tried white paths, didn't seem right).
    # Possibility 3: The starting points are different. (Tried white border, didn't match).
    # Possibility 4: The filling rule is different. Maybe it fills areas that are *only* reachable through paths of a certain length? Or areas enclosed by green *and* having a certain color?
    # Possibility 5: **The fundamental assumption is wrong.** Maybe it's not about reachability from the border.

    # Let's reconsider: What is constant? Green pixels stay green. Some other pixels change to azure. Which ones?
    # Look at the *original* colors of the pixels that become azure.
    # Ex 1: Azure pixels' original colors: 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. (Mostly 1s and 0s)
    # Ex 2: Azure pixels' original colors: 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0. (Mostly 1s and 0s)
    # Ex 3: Azure pixels' original colors: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1. (Mostly 1s and 0s)
    # It seems to be filling non-green pixels (mostly 0s and 1s) in the enclosed areas.

    # What if the BFS should *only* propagate through white (0)?
    # Redo the check: Start BFS from *all* border cells (not just white). Propagate only through *white* cells. Mark visited white cells.
    # Then, any non-green cell that is *not* white and *not* adjacent to a visited white cell is enclosed? No, that's too complicated.

    # Back to the code and the execution result. The BFS reaches everywhere non-green. This *must* be the key.
    # IF the BFS reaches (3,4) in Example 1, AND (3,4) should be azure, THEN the rule "fill unreachable cells" is wrong.
    # What rule *would* make the reachable cell (3,4) become azure?

    # Maybe it fills cells that are *surrounded* by green or other filled cells? This sounds like an iterative process.
    # Or maybe it fills cells based on local neighbourhood patterns?

    # Let's assume the BFS logic (reachability from border avoiding green) correctly identifies the "outside" region.
    # `visited` array marks the "outside".
    # The task is to fill the "inside" (non-green, non-outside cells) with azure.
    # The code `if grid[r, c] != barrier_color and not visited[r, c]: output_grid[r, c] = fill_color` implements this.
    # The code execution `check_reachability` shows that the set `not visited[r, c]` (for non-green cells) is EMPTY.

    # Could the numpy/deque implementation used by the tool be different? Extremely unlikely for such basic operations.
    # Could there be an off-by-one error in indexing or boundary checks? Checked the code, looks standard.

    # Is it possible the python environment executing the original code had a bug causing the BFS to terminate early or incorrectly, leading the original author to believe their code worked for Example 1? This seems plausible now. The provided code *looks* like it implements the reachability logic, but the test results show it outputting the *input* grid unchanged, which implies the BFS marked everything as reachable. My re-execution confirms the BFS *does* mark everything non-green as reachable.

    # Conclusion: The original code's logic, "fill non-green areas unreachable from the border", correctly implemented, does *not* solve the task because *all* non-green areas appear to be reachable in the examples according to that rule. The transformation rule must be different.

    # New Hypothesis: The rule involves the *shortest path* to the border. Perhaps cells whose shortest path to the border has to "squeeze" between green barriers are filled? Or cells beyond a certain distance?

    # Let's look at the simplest case: A green rectangle inside the grid.
    # 0 0 0 0 0
    # 0 3 3 3 0
    # 0 3 1 3 0
    # 0 3 3 3 0
    # 0 0 0 0 0
    # BFS from border reaches all 0s. It cannot reach the 1. `visited` is True for 0s, False for 1 and 3s.
    # Final loop: `if grid[r,c]!=3 and not visited[r,c]`: checks the 1. `grid[2,2]=1 != 3`. `visited[2,2]` is False. Output[2,2] becomes 8. This works.
    # Why doesn't this work for the examples? Because the "enclosed" areas in the examples *are* reachable via some path, even if it's long and winding, according to the BFS check.

    # Is it possible the definition of "barrier" includes corners? If moving from (r,c) to (nr,nc), is the move disallowed if `grid[nr,c]` or `grid[r,nc]` is green (i.e., crossing the corner of a green pixel)? Let's test this modified BFS.

## General Assessment

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying non-green pixels enclosed by green barriers (or the grid border) and changing their color to azure. It uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all non-green border pixels to find reachable cells. Pixels not reached are considered enclosed and are filled with azure.

However, the comparison with expected outputs shows this approach fails. The `Transformed Output` for each example is identical to the `Input`, meaning the code found *no* enclosed/unreachable pixels to change to azure. Code execution confirms that the implemented BFS, starting from the border and avoiding green pixels, successfully reaches *all* non-green pixels in the grid for all examples. This contradicts the expected outputs, where several non-green pixels *are* changed to azure.

This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the implemented logic (fill unreachable non-green cells) and the actual transformation rule. The rule is likely more nuanced than simple reachability from the border, or the definition of "barrier" or "reachability" is different. The "corner blocking" hypothesis also failed to identify the correct unreachable cells.

## Metrics and Analysis

Code execution (`check_reachability` function) was used to verify the set of non-green pixels unreachable by a standard 4-directional BFS starting from non-green border cells.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Expected Azure Pixels: 15 (coordinates listed above)
    *   Code-Identified Unreachable (Standard BFS): 0
    *   Code-Identified Unreachable (Corner-Blocking BFS): 0
    *   Mismatch: The code fails to identify any pixels that should be changed to azure.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Expected Azure Pixels: 15 (coordinates listed above)
    *   Code-Identified Unreachable (Standard BFS): 0
    *   Code-Identified Unreachable (Corner-Blocking BFS): 0
    *   Mismatch: The code fails to identify any pixels that should be changed to azure.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Expected Azure Pixels: 19 (coordinates listed above)
    *   Code-Identified Unreachable (Standard BFS): 0
    *   Code-Identified Unreachable (Corner-Blocking BFS): 0
    *   Mismatch: The code fails to identify any pixels that should be changed to azure.

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The core assumption that the task involves filling *unreachable* areas (as defined by standard BFS from the border avoiding green cells) is incorrect, as no such areas exist according to the algorithm, yet the expected outputs clearly show filled areas. The transformation rule must be different.

## YAML Fact Block


```yaml
task_description: Fill enclosed regions with azure, keeping barriers intact.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: variable height and width (up to 30x30)
  - background_color: white (0) is common but not exclusive.
  - barrier_color: green (3)
  - fill_color: azure (8)
objects:
  - type: barrier
    color: green (3)
    properties:
      - Forms contiguous lines or shapes.
      - May connect to the grid border or form closed loops.
      - Persist unchanged in the output.
  - type: enclosed_pixel
    color: any color except green (3)
    properties:
      - Located in regions separated from the border by green barriers.
      - Changed to azure (8) in the output.
  - type: outside_pixel
    color: any color except green (3)
    properties:
      - Reachable from the grid border without crossing green barriers (using some definition of reachability).
      - Retain their original color in the output.
actions:
  - action: identify_outside_region
    using: BFS (or similar) starting from border pixels.
    constraints:
      - Movement is orthogonal.
      - Cannot move into green (3) pixels.
      - # Initial hypothesis: Cannot move diagonally across two adjacent green pixels (corner-blocking). (This hypothesis failed)
      - # Current finding: Standard BFS reaches ALL non-green pixels.
  - action: identify_enclosed_pixels
    definition: Non-green pixels NOT part of the identified outside region.
    # Problem: With standard BFS, this set is empty.
  - action: fill_enclosed_pixels
    target: enclosed_pixels
    new_color: azure (8)
observations:
  - The definition of 'reachability' or 'outside' used by the task is different from a standard BFS from all border points avoiding green cells.
  - Visually, the areas filled with azure appear 'inside' green loops or areas walled off by green lines connecting to the border.
  - The previous code correctly identified the intended *outcome* (fill enclosed areas) but failed because its method for identifying 'enclosed' (unreachable via standard BFS) did not match the task's implicit definition.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Barrier Pixels:** Locate all green (3) pixels in the input grid. These pixels act as static barriers.
2.  **Identify the 'Outside' Region:** Determine the set of pixels considered connected to the "outside" of the grid. The "outside" is defined by reachability from the grid border.
    *   Start a search (e.g., BFS) from *all* pixels on the grid border (top, bottom, left, right edges).
    *   The search can propagate orthogonally (up, down, left, right) to adjacent pixels.
    *   Propagation is blocked *only* if the target pixel is a green (3) barrier pixel. ***(Correction: This simple rule was insufficient based on tests. The exact rule for reachability/outside needs refinement. However, assuming there *is* a rule that correctly defines an 'outside' set...)***
    *   All pixels visited by this search constitute the 'Outside' region.
3.  **Identify 'Inside' Pixels:** Examine every pixel in the grid. A pixel is considered 'Inside' if:
    *   It is *not* a green (3) barrier pixel.
    *   It was *not* visited during the 'Outside' region identification search (i.e., it is not part of the 'Outside' region).
4.  **Construct the Output Grid:**
    *   Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input.
    *   For each pixel location:
        *   If the pixel was identified as 'Inside', set its color to azure (8).
        *   Otherwise (if it's a barrier or part of the 'Outside' region), copy its original color from the input grid.
5.  Return the constructed output grid.

***Note:*** The critical failure point is Step 2/3. The standard BFS implementation reaches all non-green cells, meaning Step 3 finds no 'Inside' pixels. The correct transformation rule likely uses a modified definition of reachability, barriers, or starting points to accurately partition the grid into 'Outside' and 'Inside' regions consistent with the examples. The *intent* described above seems correct, but the *method* for partitioning needs revision.
