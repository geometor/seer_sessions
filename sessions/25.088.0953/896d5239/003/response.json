Define Barriers: Green pixels (color 3) are barriers and remain unchanged.\n2.  Identify 'Outside' Region: Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting \n    from all non-green pixels located on the outer border (edges) of the grid.\n3.  Search Propagation: The BFS explores adjacent cells horizontally and \n    vertically. The search cannot enter or cross any green (3) pixel.\n4.  Mark Reachable Pixels: All non-green pixels visited during the BFS are \n    considered part of the 'Outside' region (reachable from the border).\n5.  Identify 'Inside' Pixels: Any pixel that is not green (3) and was not \n    visited by the BFS is considered 'Inside' (enclosed).\n6.  Construct Output: Create the output grid where:\n    - Green (3) pixels keep their color.\n    - 'Outside' pixels keep their original color.\n    - 'Inside' pixels are changed to azure (8).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a list of lists of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to a NumPy array for easier manipulation and access to shape\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    \n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    # Pixels will be overwritten only if they are 'inside'.\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n\n    # Define barrier color and the color to fill enclosed areas\n    barrier_color = 3\n    fill_color = 8\n\n    # Keep track of visited cells during the reachability search (BFS)\n    # visited[r, c] = True means the cell is reachable from the border ('Outside')\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    \n    # Use a queue for Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all non-barrier border cells\n    # These are the starting points for defining the 'Outside' region.\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check if the cell is on the border\n            is_border = r == 0 or r == height - 1 or c == 0 or c == width - 1\n            if is_border:\n                # Check if it's not a barrier \n                if grid[r, c] != barrier_color:\n                    # If not already visited (shouldn't be, but safe check), add to queue\n                    if not visited[r, c]:\n                        visited[r, c] = True\n                        queue.append((r, c))\n\n    # Perform BFS to find all reachable cells ('Outside' region)\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Explore neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n            # Check if the neighbor is within grid bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                # Check if the neighbor is not a barrier and has not been visited yet\n                if grid[nr, nc] != barrier_color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                    # Mark as visited and add to the queue to explore from later\n                    visited[nr, nc] = True\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    # Modify the output grid based on reachability\n    # Iterate through all cells in the grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check if a cell is NOT a barrier AND was NOT visited by the BFS\n            if grid[r, c] != barrier_color and not visited[r, c]:\n                # This cell is 'Inside' (enclosed), so change its color to the fill color\n                output_grid[r, c] = fill_color\n            # Else (the cell is either a barrier or was visited ('Outside')), \n            # it keeps its original color (already handled by copying grid initially).\n\n    # Convert the result back to a standard list of lists format\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
