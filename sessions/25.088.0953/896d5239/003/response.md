"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying regions enclosed by green barriers (color 3) 
and filling them with azure (color 8).

1.  Define Barriers: Green pixels (color 3) are barriers and remain unchanged.
2.  Identify 'Outside' Region: Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting 
    from all non-green pixels located on the outer border (edges) of the grid.
3.  Search Propagation: The BFS explores adjacent cells horizontally and 
    vertically. The search cannot enter or cross any green (3) pixel.
4.  Mark Reachable Pixels: All non-green pixels visited during the BFS are 
    considered part of the 'Outside' region (reachable from the border).
5.  Identify 'Inside' Pixels: Any pixel that is not green (3) and was not 
    visited by the BFS is considered 'Inside' (enclosed).
6.  Construct Output: Create the output grid where:
    - Green (3) pixels keep their color.
    - 'Outside' pixels keep their original color.
    - 'Inside' pixels are changed to azure (8).
