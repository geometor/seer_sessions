InputAnalysis:
  Objects:
    - Type: Contiguous block of non-white pixels.
    - Properties:
        - Color: The color of the pixels in the block.
        - Coordinates: List of (row, col) tuples.
        - BoundingBox: Defined by min/max row/col.
        - Width: BoundingBox width.
        - Height: BoundingBox height.
        - Area: BoundingBox area (Width * Height).
        - AspectRatio: max(Width, Height) / min(Width, Height).
Transformation:
  OutputGrid:
    - Shape: Square (N x N).
    - Size (N): Determined by the maximum dimension (width or height) found among all input object bounding boxes.
    - Structure: Concentric square layers centered within the grid.
  Layering:
    - ObjectOrdering:
        - Identify the 'Center Object': The input object with the minimum BoundingBox Area. If multiple objects share the minimum area, select the one whose AspectRatio is closest to 1.
        - Identify 'Other Objects': All objects excluding the Center Object.
        - Sort 'Other Objects' by BoundingBox Area in ascending order.
        - Final Layer Order (Inside -> Out): [Center Object] + [Sorted Other Objects]
    - DrawingProcess:
        - Determine the number of layers (equal to the number of objects).
        - Determine the size of each layer. Layers decrease in size by 2 units (width and height) for each step towards the center. The outermost layer has size N x N.
        - Fill the output grid by drawing filled squares, starting from the outermost layer (using the color of the last object in the 'Final Layer Order') and proceeding inwards towards the center (using the color of the 'Center Object' for the innermost layer). Each smaller square overwrites the center of the previously drawn larger square.
