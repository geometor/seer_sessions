            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core components of the task: finding colored objects in the input, calculating their bounding box properties (area, aspect ratio, dimensions), and determining the output grid size based on the maximum dimension of any object's bounding box. It also correctly identified the sorting mechanism: select a 'center' object based on minimum bounding box area (with aspect ratio closest to 1 as a tie-breaker), and sort the remaining objects by ascending bounding box area.\n\nThe failure occurred in the final step: constructing the output grid. The code attempted to draw layers from the inside out, but the `draw_centered_square` function filled the entire specified area, causing outer layers to completely overwrite inner layers. The expected output requires concentric square frames or layers.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to reverse the drawing order. Instead of drawing from inside-out, we will draw from outside-in. We will iterate through the sorted list of objects in reverse order (starting with the object corresponding to the outermost layer). For each object, we calculate the size of its corresponding square layer (decreasing by 2 for each step inwards) and use the *existing* `draw_centered_square` function (which fills the area). This approach naturally creates the desired layered effect because each subsequent (smaller) square overwrites the center of the previously drawn (larger) square.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the analysis of the previous code's logic and the provided examples:\n\n*   **Object Identification:** The code successfully identifies distinct contiguous non-white objects in all examples.\n*   **Property Calculation:** Bounding box dimensions, area, and aspect ratio are calculated for each object.\n    *   Example 1: Azure (1x1, A=1, AR=1), Green (1x4, A=4, AR=4), Red (1x5, A=5, AR=5)\n    *   Example 2: Magenta (2x1, A=2, AR=2), Green (4x1, A=4, AR=4), Blue (6x1, A=6, AR=6)\n    *   Example 3: Orange (1x2, A=2, AR=2), Yellow (4x1, A=4, AR=4), Green (1x6, A=6, AR=6), Azure (8x1, A=8, AR=8)\n*   **Sorting and Layer Order:**\n    *   The \"center\" object (innermost layer) is consistently the one with the minimum bounding box area, using aspect ratio closest to 1 as a tie-breaker (though not needed in these examples as areas are unique).\n        *   Ex 1 Center: Azure\n        *   Ex 2 Center: Magenta\n        *   Ex 3 Center: Orange\n    *   The remaining objects are sorted by ascending bounding box area to determine the order of layers outwards.\n        *   Ex 1 Layers (In->Out): Azure, Green, Red\n        *   Ex 2 Layers (In->Out): Magenta, Green, Blue\n        *   Ex 3 Layers (In->Out): Orange, Yellow, Green, Azure\n*   **Output Grid Size:** The output grid is a square whose side length is determined by the maximum dimension (width or height) of the bounding box of *any* object in the input.\n    *   Ex 1: max(1, 5, 4) = 5 -> 5x5 output\n    *   Ex 2: max(2, 4, 6) = 6 -> 6x6 output\n    *   Ex 3: max(2, 4, 6, 8) = 8 -> 8x8 output\n*   **Output Structure:** The output is composed of concentric square layers, centered within the grid. The color of each layer corresponds to the color of an input object, ordered as determined by the sorting rule (innermost layer = center object, subsequent layers = other objects sorted by area).\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

The output grid will be a square with this maximum dimension as its side length (N x N). Initialize an N x N grid, typically filled with the background color (white/0).\n4.  **Order Objects for Layering:**\n    a.  Find the 'Center Object': Select the object with the smallest bounding box area. If there's a tie in area, choose the object whose aspect ratio is closest to 1.\n    b.  Create a list of the remaining 'Other Objects'.\n    c.  Sort the 'Other Objects' list based on their bounding box area in ascending order.\n    d.  Combine these to form the final object order for layering, starting with the Center Object and followed by the sorted Other Objects. This list represents the layers from the inside out.\n5.  **Construct Output Layers:**\n    a.  Iterate through the object list created in step 4d *in reverse order* (from the object corresponding to the outermost layer to the Center Object).\n    b.  For each object in this reversed sequence, determine the size of the square layer it represents. The outermost layer has size N x N, the next layer inwards is (N-2) x (N-2), the next is (N-4) x (N-4), and so on.\n    c.  Draw a filled square of the calculated size, centered within the output grid, using the color of the current object. Because the drawing proceeds from the largest square (outermost layer) to the smallest (innermost layer), this process correctly creates the concentric layered pattern.\n6.  **Final Output:** The resulting N x N grid with concentric colored layers is the final output."
