These objects are simple lines or small rectangles.\n2.  **Output:** The output is a smaller, square grid. It represents a composite image formed by layering the input objects concentrically.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying all colored objects, determining their relative sizes (based on bounding boxes), and arranging them as centered layers in the output grid. The outermost layer corresponds to the object with the largest bounding box, and the innermost layer corresponds to the object with the smallest bounding box.\n4.  **Object Identification:** Objects are contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.\n5.  **Ordering:** Objects need to be ordered based on the size of their bounding boxes. The area of the bounding box appears to be the primary sorting key. The object with the smallest bounding box area becomes the center of the output pattern. In case of ties for the smallest area, the object whose bounding box is most square-like (aspect ratio closest to 1) is chosen as the center. The remaining objects are ordered from smallest area to largest area.\n6.  **Output Construction:**\n    *   The output grid dimensions are determined by the largest dimension (width or height) of the bounding box of the object with the *largest* area. The output grid is always square.\n    *   The construction proceeds layer by layer, starting from the outside. The outermost layer (the entire output grid) is filled with the color of the object with the largest bounding box area.\n    *   Subsequent inner layers are created by taking the object with the next largest bounding box area. A centered square/rectangle is drawn with this object's color. The size of this inner square is 2 units smaller (in both height and width) than the layer immediately outside it.\n    *   This process repeats, moving inwards, using the ordered objects (from largest area towards smallest), until the central object (smallest area) is drawn in the innermost layer.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
