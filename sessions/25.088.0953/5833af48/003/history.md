"""
Transforms the input grid based on identifying two main regions: a large, solid-colored rectangular 'canvas' and a 'stamps' area containing other non-white patterns. The transformation involves:
1. Identifying the largest contiguous rectangular area of a single non-white color (the 'Canvas Area'). Determine its color ('Canvas Color') and dimensions.
2. Identifying all other non-white pixels in the input grid that are *not* part of the Canvas Area. These constitute the 'Stamps Area'.
3. Determining the bounding box of the Stamps Area.
4. Creating an output grid with the dimensions of the Canvas Area, filled entirely with the Canvas Color.
5. Iterating through the cells within the bounding box of the Stamps Area in the input grid.
6. For each cell within the Stamps Area bounding box:
    a. If the input cell's color is non-white (not 0) AND it's not part of the identified Canvas Area rectangle:
        i. Calculate the cell's relative row and column position within the Stamps Area bounding box (relative to its top-left corner).
        ii. If these relative coordinates fall within the bounds of the output grid:
            - Set the corresponding cell in the output grid to azure (8).
7. Return the modified output grid.

Okay, the metrics code ran successfully this time.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

1.  **Canvas Identification**: The `find_largest_monochromatic_rect` function correctly identifies the large, solid-colored rectangle in each input:
    *   Example 1: 8x16 blue (1) rectangle starting at (6, 1).
    *   Example 2: 9x15 green (3) rectangle starting at (5, 1).
    *   Example 3: 6x9 yellow (4) rectangle starting at (6, 3).
    These match the dimensions and color of the main background of the expected outputs.

2.  **Stamp Pixels**: The code correctly identifies pixels that are non-white and *not* part of the canvas rectangle (`input_stamp_pixels`).

3.  **Relative Coordinates Mismatch**: The crucial finding is `relative_coords_match_azure: false` for all examples.
    *   `num_stamps_on_output: 0` - My calculation logic for which stamp pixels should appear on the output grid based on relative coordinates seems flawed. The condition `0 <= rel_r < canvas_h and 0 <= rel_c < canvas_w` is not selecting *any* pixels. Why?
        *   `rel_r = r - canvas_r`
        *   `rel_c = c - canvas_c`
        Looking at Example 1: Canvas starts at `r=6`. Stamp pixels are at `r=1, 2, 3, 4`. `rel_r` will be `1-6=-5`, `2-6=-4`, etc. These are *negative* and thus fail the `0 <= rel_r` check.
    *   `missing_coords`: These are the coordinates (relative to the output grid's top-left) where azure (8) pixels *should* be according to the expected output.
    *   `extra_coords`: Empty, confirming that my relative coordinate calculation didn't place any pixels onto the output.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

The relative positioning is not calculated from the canvas's top-left corner `(canvas_r, canvas_c)`.

Let's reconsider the relationship between the input stamp area and the output.
Maybe the relative positioning is based on the bounding box of the *stamps area*? The previous code tried this but failed. What was wrong with that?
*   It used a *single* bounding box for *all* stamps.
*   It mapped the top-left of this bounding box to the top-left (0,0) of the output grid.

Let's re-examine Example 1:
*   Canvas: (r=6, c=1), h=8, w=16, color=1 (blue)
*   Output: 8x16 grid, mostly blue (1), with some azure (8) pixels.
*   Input Stamps: Pixels in rows 1-4, columns 1-13. Colors are red (2), azure (8), blue (1). Note: some "stamp" pixels are blue (1), same as canvas! The definition should be "non-white pixels outside the identified largest monochromatic rectangle".
*   Stamp pixels (non-white, outside canvas):
    *   (1,1) Red
    *   (1,2) Azure
    *   (1,3) Red
    *   (1,4) Red
    *   (1,6) Blue -> Should this be a stamp? Yes, it's outside the (6,1)-(13,16) canvas.
    *   ... lots of pixels ...
    *   (4,13) Azure
*   Expected Output Azure Pixels (relative coords): (0,5), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (4,1), (4,13), (5,0), (5,1), (5,12), (5,13), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,13), (6,14), (6,15), (7,1), (7,13).

Let's look at the absolute coordinates of the *input* pixels that seem to correspond to the *output* azure pixels.
If output `(rel_r, rel_c)` corresponds to input `(r, c)`, maybe there's a fixed offset?
Output (0, 5) -> ?
Output (1, 4) -> ?
Output (4, 1) -> ? Input (1,1) is Red. Output (4,1) is Azure. Input (1,2) is Azure. Output (4,13) is Azure. Input (1,3) is Red.
Output (5, 0) -> ?
Output (5, 1) -> ? Input (2,1) is Azure.
Output (6, 1) -> ? Input (3,1) is Red. Output (6,2) -> ? Input (3,2) is Azure. Output (6,3) -> ? Input (3,3) is Azure.
Output (7, 1) -> ? Input (4,1) is Red.

This direct mapping isn't obvious.

Let's reconsider the structure:
Input: Area A (stamps), Area B (canvas).
Output: Area B' (same size/color as B), with pattern C (azure pixels).

How is pattern C derived from Area A?
Maybe it's about the *relative* positions *within* Area A.

Let's find the bounding box of the non-white pixels outside the canvas (the 'stamps').
Example 1:
*   Stamps are in rows 1-4 and columns 1-13.
*   Bounding box: min_r=1, min_c=1, max_r=4, max_c=13. (Height=4, Width=13)
*   The pattern within this bounding box needs to be transferred.

How does it transfer?
Previous code: `rel_r = r - min_r_stamp`, `rel_c = c - min_c_stamp`. Maps (1,1) -> (0,0).
Let's trace `input(1,1)` which is Red(2). `rel_r=0`, `rel_c=0`. Does `output(0,0)` become azure? No, `output(0,0)` is blue(1).
Let's trace `input(1,2)` which is Azure(8). `rel_r=0`, `rel_c=1`. Does `output(0,1)` become azure? No, blue(1).
Let's trace `input(3,7)` which is Azure(8). `rel_r=2`, `rel_c=6`. Does `output(2,6)` become azure? Yes!
Let's trace `input(3,12)` which is Blue(1). `rel_r=2`, `rel_c=11`. Does `output(2,11)` become azure? No, blue(1).
Let's trace `input(3,13)` which is Azure(8). `rel_r=2`, `rel_c=12`. Does `output(2,12)` become azure? No, blue(1).

This mapping `(r - min_r_stamp, c - min_c_stamp)` isn't quite right either. The previous code *did* use this exact logic (`rel_r = r - min_r_stamp`, `rel_c = c - min_c_stamp`) but produced the wrong output. Why?

Let's re-read the previous code's logic:

```python
# 5. & 6. Iterate through the Stamps Area bounding box and transfer patterns
for r in range(min_r_stamp, max_r_stamp + 1):
    for c in range(min_c_stamp, max_c_stamp + 1):
        # Check if the pixel is within the original grid bounds
        if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols:
             input_color = grid[r, c]
             # Check if it's a non-white pixel AND truly part of the stamps (not canvas)
             is_stamp_pixel = (
                 input_color != 0 and
                 not (canvas_r <= r < canvas_r + canvas_h and canvas_c <= c < canvas_c + canvas_w)
             )

             if is_stamp_pixel:
                # Calculate relative position within the stamp bounding box
                rel_r = r - min_r_stamp # <<<<<<< RELATIVE TO STAMP BOX TOP-LEFT
                rel_c = c - min_c_stamp # <<<<<<< RELATIVE TO STAMP BOX TOP-LEFT

                # Check if relative position is within the output grid bounds
                if 0 <= rel_r < output_grid.shape[0] and 0 <= rel_c < output_grid.shape[1]:
                    # Set the output pixel to azure (8)
                    output_grid[rel_r, rel_c] = 8 # <<<<<<<<< PLACED AT (rel_r, rel_c) IN OUTPUT
```

This seems logically consistent with the idea of taking the pattern within the stamp bounding box and placing it at the top-left of the output grid, painting azure for any non-white stamp pixel.

Why did it fail? Let's simulate Example 1 again with this exact logic.
*   Input 17x18. Canvas: (r=6, c=1), h=8, w=16, color=1. Output grid is 8x16, filled with 1.
*   Stamps: Non-white pixels outside rows 6-13 and cols 1-16.
    *   Pixels in rows 1-4, cols 1-4 (colors 2, 8)
    *   Pixels in rows 1-4, cols 6-13 (colors 1, 8) -> Note the blue(1) pixels here *are* stamps.
*   Bounding Box of Stamps:
    *   Min R = 1, Max R = 4
    *   Min C = 1, Max C = 13
    *   (min_r_stamp=1, min_c_stamp=1, max_r_stamp=4, max_c_stamp=13)
*   Iteration:
    *   r=1, c=1: input(1,1)=2 (Red). Is stamp? Yes. rel_r=0, rel_c=0. output(0,0)=8.
    *   r=1, c=2: input(1,2)=8 (Azure). Is stamp? Yes. rel_r=0, rel_c=1. output(0,1)=8.
    *   r=1, c=3: input(1,3)=2 (Red). Is stamp? Yes. rel_r=0, rel_c=2. output(0,2)=8.
    *   r=1, c=4: input(1,4)=2 (Red). Is stamp? Yes. rel_r=0, rel_c=3. output(0,3)=8.
    *   r=1, c=5: input(1,5)=0 (White). Is stamp? No. Skip.
    *   r=1, c=6: input(1,6)=1 (Blue). Is stamp? Yes (outside canvas rect). rel_r=0, rel_c=5. output(0,5)=8.
    *   ...
    *   r=3, c=1: input(3,1)=2 (Red). Is stamp? Yes. rel_r=2, rel_c=0. output(2,0)=8.
    *   r=3, c=2: input(3,2)=8 (Azure). Is stamp? Yes. rel_r=2, rel_c=1. output(2,1)=8.
    *   r=3, c=3: input(3,3)=8 (Azure). Is stamp? Yes. rel_r=2, rel_c=2. output(2,2)=8.
    *   r=3, c=4: input(3,4)=8 (Azure). Is stamp? Yes. rel_r=2, rel_c=3. output(2,3)=8.
    *   r=3, c=5: input(3,5)=0 (White). Skip.
    *   r=3, c=6: input(3,6)=8 (Azure). Is stamp? Yes. rel_r=2, rel_c=5. output(2,5)=8.
    *   r=3, c=7: input(3,7)=8 (Azure). Is stamp? Yes. rel_r=2, rel_c=6. output(2,6)=8.
    *   r=3, c=8: input(3,8)=1 (Blue). Is stamp? Yes. rel_r=2, rel_c=7. output(2,7)=8.
    *   ...
*   Simulated Output (Top Left):
    
```
    8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1  <- from r=1 stamps
    8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1  <- from r=2 stamps
    8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1  <- from r=3 stamps
    8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1  <- from r=4 stamps
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    ...
    ```

This matches the `Transformed Output` reported for Example 1! So the code *did* implement the logic I thought it did (transferring the stamp bounding box content relative to its own top-left corner to the output grid's top-left corner).

**Conclusion:** The hypothesis that the stamp pattern (defined by non-white pixels outside the canvas, within their collective bounding box) is transferred relative to the stamp bounding box top-left corner is INCORRECT.

**New Hypothesis:** The transfer is relative to the *canvas* position, but only *if* the relative coordinate falls within the canvas bounds.
Let's try this:
1. Find canvas (r, c, h, w, color).
2. Create output grid (h x w) filled with canvas color.
3. Iterate through *all* input pixels `(in_r, in_c)` with `color != 0`.
4. If the pixel `(in_r, in_c)` is *not* part of the canvas rectangle:
    a. Calculate relative position: `rel_r = in_r - canvas_r`, `rel_c = in_c - canvas_c`.
    b. If `0 <= rel_r < canvas_h` and `0 <= rel_c < canvas_w`:
        c. Set `output_grid[rel_r, rel_c] = 8` (azure).

Let's test this on Example 1:
*   Canvas: (r=6, c=1), h=8, w=16, color=1. Output is 8x16 filled with 1.
*   Stamp pixel `input(1,1)` = Red(2). Outside canvas. `rel_r = 1-6 = -5`. `rel_c = 1-1 = 0`. Fails `0 <= rel_r` check. No change to output.
*   Stamp pixel `input(1,6)` = Blue(1). Outside canvas. `rel_r = 1-6 = -5`. `rel_c = 6-1 = 5`. Fails `0 <= rel_r`. No change.
*   Stamp pixel `input(3,7)` = Azure(8). Outside canvas. `rel_r = 3-6 = -3`. `rel_c = 7-1 = 6`. Fails `0 <= rel_r`. No change.

This doesn't work either. The relative coordinates are negative because the stamps are *above* the canvas.

What if the relative offset isn't `(canvas_r, canvas_c)`?
What if the offset is determined differently?

Consider the overall input grid structure. There's a block of 'stamps' and a block of 'canvas'. They might be separated by white space.
Maybe the relative positioning is between the *top-left corner of the stamp bounding box* and the *top-left corner of the canvas*?

Example 1:
*   Canvas TL: (6, 1)
*   Stamp BBox TL: (1, 1)
*   Offset Vector (Canvas TL - Stamp BBox TL): `(6-1, 1-1) = (5, 0)`

Hypothesis 3:
1. Find canvas (canvas_r, canvas_c, h, w, color).
2. Create output grid (h x w) filled with canvas color.
3. Find bounding box of all non-white pixels *outside* the canvas (stamp_min_r, stamp_min_c, stamp_max_r, stamp_max_c).
4. Calculate offset: `offset_r = canvas_r - stamp_min_r`, `offset_c = canvas_c - stamp_min_c`.
5. Iterate through all input pixels `(in_r, in_c)` within the stamp bounding box (`stamp_min_r <= in_r <= stamp_max_r`, `stamp_min_c <= in_c <= stamp_max_c`).
6. If `input_grid[in_r, in_c]` is non-white AND *not* part of the canvas rectangle:
    a. Calculate target coordinates in the output grid: `target_r = in_r - stamp_min_r + offset_r`? No, that simplifies to `canvas_r`. Wait. `target_r = in_r + offset_r`? No.
    Let's try mapping the relative position within the stamp box to a position relative to the canvas origin + offset.
    `rel_stamp_r = in_r - stamp_min_r`
    `rel_stamp_c = in_c - stamp_min_c`
    Target position in output: `target_r = rel_stamp_r + offset_r`? `target_c = rel_stamp_c + offset_c`?
    Let's test this mapping: `target_r = (in_r - stamp_min_r) + (canvas_r - stamp_min_r)` - No.
    Try: `target_r = in_r - canvas_r`? No, we know that's wrong.
    Try: `target_r = in_r - stamp_min_r`? Maps stamp pixel (stamp_min_r, stamp_min_c) to (0,0) in output? Doesn't match expected.

Maybe the offset is applied differently. What if we map the input stamp pixel `(in_r, in_c)` to `output(in_r + offset_r, in_c + offset_c)`?
Let `offset_r = canvas_r - stamp_min_r` and `offset_c = canvas_c - stamp_min_c`.
Example 1: `offset = (5, 0)`.
*   Input stamp `(1, 1)` Red -> Target `(1+5, 1+0) = (6, 1)`. Is `output(6, 1)` azure? Yes! `(6,1)` is in `missing_coords`.
*   Input stamp `(1, 2)` Azure -> Target `(1+5, 2+0) = (6, 2)`. Is `output(6, 2)` azure? Yes! `(6,2)` is in `missing_coords`.
*   Input stamp `(1, 3)` Red -> Target `(1+5, 3+0) = (6, 3)`. Is `output(6, 3)` azure? Yes! `(6,3)` is in `missing_coords`.
*   Input stamp `(1, 6)` Blue -> Target `(1+5, 6+0) = (6, 6)`. Is `output(6, 6)` azure? No, it's blue(1). This pixel `(1,6)` *was* blue. Maybe only non-canvas-color stamps are transferred? No, the blue pixel `input(1,8)` (Azure) becomes `output(6, 8)` Azure.
*   Wait, `is_stamp_pixel` check: `input_color != 0` AND *not* part of canvas rectangle. So `input(1,6)` (Blue) *is* a stamp pixel. Why doesn't it become Azure?
    *   Maybe the rule is: Find canvas. Output = canvas size/color. Find stamp bounding box. Calculate offset = canvas_TL - stamp_bbox_TL. For each pixel `(in_r, in_c)` in stamp bbox: if `input(in_r, in_c)` is non-white and not on canvas rectangle, calculate `target_r = in_r + offset_r`, `target_c = in_c + offset_c`. If target coords are within output bounds, set `output(target_r, target_c) = 8`.

Let's re-test this revised Hypothesis 3:
Example 1: `offset = (5, 0)`. Output is 8x16 filled with 1.
*   Input `(1, 1)` Red(2). Is stamp. Target `(6, 1)`. In bounds (0<=6<8, 0<=1<16). Set `output(6, 1) = 8`. Matches expected!
*   Input `(1, 2)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(6, 2)`. In bounds. Set `output(6, 2) = 8`. Matches expected!
*   Input `(1, 3)` Red(2). Is stamp. Target `(6, 3)`. In bounds. Set `output(6, 3) = 8`. Matches expected!
*   Input `(1, 4)` Red(2). Is stamp. Target `(6, 4)`. In bounds. Set `output(6, 4) = 8`. Expected is blue(1). Mismatch!
*   Input `(1, 5)` White(0). Not stamp. Skip.
*   Input `(1, 6)` Blue(1). Is stamp. Target `(6, 6)`. In bounds. Set `output(6, 6) = 8`. Expected is blue(1). Mismatch!
*   Input `(1, 7)` Blue(1). Is stamp. Target `(6, 7)`. In bounds. Set `output(6, 7) = 8`. Expected is blue(1). Mismatch!
*   Input `(1, 8)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(6, 8)`. In bounds. Set `output(6, 8) = 8`. Matches expected!

This hypothesis is also flawed. The transformation isn't simply transferring all non-white stamp pixels with an offset.

Let's rethink the "Stamp" definition. Maybe it's not *all* non-white pixels outside the canvas. Maybe it's only pixels of certain colors? Or maybe it's only *contiguous objects* outside the canvas?

Let's look at the colors involved:
*   Ex 1: Canvas=Blue(1). Stamps have Red(2), Azure(8), Blue(1). Output stamps = Azure(8).
*   Ex 2: Canvas=Green(3). Stamps have Red(2), Azure(8), Green(3). Output stamps = Azure(8).
*   Ex 3: Canvas=Yellow(4). Stamps have Red(2), Azure(8), Yellow(4). Output stamps = Azure(8).

It seems consistent that the output stamp color is always Azure(8).
It also seems consistent that the pixels being stamped correspond to input pixels that were *not* white(0) and *not* part of the main canvas rectangle. The blue(1) pixels in Ex1's stamp area and the green(3) in Ex2's stamp area *should* participate according to this rule.

What if the offset calculation is wrong?
Example 1: Canvas TL (6, 1). Stamp BBox TL (1, 1). Offset (5, 0).
Example 2: Canvas TL (5, 1). Stamp BBox TL (1, 1). Offset (4, 0).
Example 3: Canvas TL (6, 3). Stamp BBox TL (1, 0). Offset (5, 3).

Let's apply Hypothesis 3 (Offset = CanvasTL - StampTL) to Example 3:
*   Canvas: (r=6, c=3), h=6, w=9, color=4(Yellow). Output 6x9 filled with 4.
*   Stamps: Non-white outside canvas. BBox TL = (1, 0).
*   Offset: `(6-1, 3-0) = (5, 3)`.
*   Input `(1, 0)` Red(2). Is stamp. Target `(1+5, 0+3) = (6, 3)`. Out of bounds (max row index is 5).
*   Input `(1, 1)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(1+5, 1+3) = (6, 4)`. Out of bounds.
*   Input `(2, 0)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(2+5, 0+3) = (7, 3)`. Out of bounds.
*   Input `(3, 0)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(3+5, 0+3) = (8, 3)`. Out of bounds.
*   Input `(1, 4)` Yellow(4). Is stamp. Target `(1+5, 4+3) = (6, 7)`. Out of bounds.
*   Input `(1, 6)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(1+5, 6+3) = (6, 9)`. Out of bounds (max col index is 8).

This offset calculation seems fundamentally wrong or the mapping method is wrong.

Back to basics: What is constant?
Output grid size = Canvas grid size.
Output grid background color = Canvas color.
Output stamp color = Azure (8).

What varies? The locations of the Azure pixels.

Let `f(in_r, in_c) -> (out_r, out_c)` be the mapping function for a stamp pixel.
We need to find `f` and the condition under which `output[f(in_r, in_c)]` becomes 8.

Consider the relationship between the *entire* input grid and the output grid.
Maybe it's a simple overlay?
If we take the canvas rectangle from the input `input[canvas_r:canvas_r+h, canvas_c:canvas_c+w]` and overlay the stamp pattern onto it somehow?

Let's look at the *relative structure* of the stamps.
Example 1: Stamps are in rows 1-4. Canvas starts row 6. Gap of 1 row (row 5).
Example 2: Stamps are in rows 1-3. Canvas starts row 5. Gap of 1 row (row 4).
Example 3: Stamps are in rows 1-4. Canvas starts row 6. Gap of 1 row (row 5).

Is there a consistent vertical shift?
Ex 1: Stamps end row 4, Canvas starts row 6. Shift = `canvas_r - (stamp_max_r + 1) = 6 - (4+1) = 1`? No.
Shift = `canvas_r - stamp_min_r = 6 - 1 = 5`. We tested this offset. Failed.

What if the output grid isn't just the canvas? What if it's a crop or view?
No, the output size perfectly matches the canvas size.

Could it be related to the center or some other anchor point?

Let's re-examine the first successful transformation: `input(3,7)` (Azure) maps to `output(2,6)` (Azure). How?
Canvas TL: (6, 1). Stamp BBox TL: (1, 1).
Maybe the mapping is relative to the *bounding box* of the stamps, but placed at a *specific location* in the output grid?
Map `(in_r, in_c)` -> `(in_r - stamp_min_r, in_c - stamp_min_c)`?
Input (3, 7) -> `(3-1, 7-1) = (2, 6)`. This matches `output(2, 6)`!

Let's test this: **Hypothesis 4**
1. Find canvas (r, c, h, w, color).
2. Create output grid (h x w) filled with canvas color.
3. Find bounding box of all non-white pixels *outside* the canvas (stamp_min_r, stamp_min_c, stamp_max_r, stamp_max_c).
4. Iterate through input pixels `(in_r, in_c)` in the stamp bounding box.
5. If `input_grid[in_r, in_c]` is non-white AND *not* part of the canvas rectangle:
    a. Calculate target coordinates relative to the stamp bounding box TL: `target_r = in_r - stamp_min_r`, `target_c = in_c - stamp_min_c`.
    b. If target coords `(target_r, target_c)` are within the output grid bounds (`0 <= target_r < h`, `0 <= target_c < w`):
        c. Set `output_grid[target_r, target_c] = 8`.

Testing Hypothesis 4 on Example 1:
*   Canvas h=8, w=16. Output 8x16 filled with 1.
*   Stamp BBox TL = (1, 1).
*   Input `(1, 1)` Red(2). Is stamp. Target `(1-1, 1-1) = (0, 0)`. In bounds. `output(0, 0) = 8`. Expected: 1. Fail.
*   Input `(3, 7)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(3-1, 7-1) = (2, 6)`. In bounds. `output(2, 6) = 8`. Expected: 8. Match!
*   Input `(4, 13)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(4-1, 13-1) = (3, 12)`. In bounds. `output(3, 12) = 8`. Expected: 1. Fail.

This is exactly the logic the failed code implemented! I simulated it correctly before, and it produced the wrong output grid shown in the results. Why did my manual trace just now seem different? Let's re-trace `input(1,1)` Red(2).
`in_r=1, in_c=1`. `stamp_min_r=1, stamp_min_c=1`. `target_r=0, target_c=0`. `output[0,0]=8`.
This *is* what the failed code produces (top-left 8). But the expected output top-left is 1.

What is different between `input(3,7)` (maps correctly) and `input(1,1)` or `input(4,13)` (map incorrectly)?

Could the definition of "stamp pixel" be wrong?
Maybe it's *only* the azure (8) pixels outside the canvas?
Hypothesis 5: Like Hypothesis 4, but only map pixels where `input_grid[in_r, in_c] == 8`.
Testing Hypothesis 5 on Example 1:
*   Canvas h=8, w=16. Output 8x16 filled with 1. Stamp BBox TL = (1, 1).
*   Input `(1, 1)` Red(2). Skip (not Azure).
*   Input `(1, 2)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(1-1, 1-1) = (0, 1)`. In bounds. `output(0, 1) = 8`. Expected: 1. Fail.
*   Input `(3, 7)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(3-1, 7-1) = (2, 6)`. In bounds. `output(2, 6) = 8`. Expected: 8. Match!
*   Input `(4, 13)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(4-1, 13-1) = (3, 12)`. In bounds. `output(3, 12) = 8`. Expected: 1. Fail.

Still not right.

Let's consider the possibility that the "Stamp Area" isn't defined by *all* non-canvas, non-white pixels. What if it's only a specific object or set of objects?
In Ex 1, there are reddish shapes and bluish shapes above the canvas.
In Ex 2, reddish shapes and greenish shapes.
In Ex 3, reddish shapes and yellowish shapes.

What if the task is to find the "pattern" defined by Azure(8) pixels located *outside* the main canvas?
Hypothesis 6:
1. Find canvas (r, c, h, w, color).
2. Create output grid (h x w) filled with canvas color.
3. Find all Azure(8) pixels `(in_r, in_c)` in the input grid that are *not* part of the canvas rectangle.
4. Find the bounding box of *these specific Azure pixels* (azure_min_r, azure_min_c, ...).
5. Iterate through only these Azure pixels `(in_r, in_c)`.
    a. Calculate target coordinates relative to the Azure bounding box TL: `target_r = in_r - azure_min_r`, `target_c = in_c - azure_min_c`.
    b. If target coords `(target_r, target_c)` are within the output grid bounds (`0 <= target_r < h`, `0 <= target_c < w`):
        c. Set `output_grid[target_r, target_c] = 8`.

Testing Hypothesis 6 on Example 1:
*   Canvas h=8, w=16. Output 8x16 filled with 1.
*   Azure pixels outside canvas: (1,2), (1,8), (1,9), (1,12), (1,13), (2,1), (2,2), (2,8), (2,9), (2,12), (2,13), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7), (3,12), (3,
