**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently feature two distinct non-white regions separated by white (0) pixels.
    *   One region contains multiple small patterns ("stamps"). These patterns are primarily composed of azure (8) pixels and one other non-white color (e.g., red, green, yellow in the examples).
    *   The other region is a large, solid rectangle filled with a single non-white color ("canvas"). The color of this canvas varies between examples (blue, green, yellow).
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid's dimensions match the dimensions of the "canvas" rectangle found in the input grid. The background color of the output grid is the same as the "canvas" color.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves transferring patterns from the "stamps" region onto the "canvas" region.
    *   The relative positions of the patterns within the "stamps" region are preserved when applied to the output grid.
    *   All non-white pixels found within the "stamps" region are mapped to the color azure (8) in the output grid. Pixels that were originally azure (8) remain azure (8). Other non-white pixels (red, green, yellow) are changed to azure (8).
    *   White pixels from the "stamps" region are ignored, leaving the original canvas color in the corresponding output grid cell.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  Structure: Contains two distinct non-white regions separated by white pixels.
  Region1:
    Name: StampsArea
    Content: Multiple small patterns (stamps).
    Colors: Primarily azure (8) and one other varying non-white color (e.g., red, green, yellow), plus white (0) background/separators.
    Location: Variable (often top or left).
  Region2:
    Name: CanvasArea
    Content: A single large solid rectangle.
    Colors: Uniformly filled with one non-white color (e.g., blue, green, yellow).
    Location: Variable (often bottom or right).
    Property: Largest contiguous monochromatic non-white object.
Output:
  Dimensions: Matches the dimensions of the CanvasArea from the input.
  BackgroundColor: Same as the color of the CanvasArea from the input.
  ForegroundContent: Patterns derived from the StampsArea.
Transformation:
  Action: Pattern Transfer and Color Replacement.
  Source: StampsArea.
  Target: CanvasArea.
  Mapping:
    - Find the bounding box of the CanvasArea.
    - Find the bounding box of the StampsArea.
    - Create an output grid with the dimensions of the CanvasArea, filled with the CanvasArea's color.
    - Iterate through each pixel (r, c) within the bounding box of the StampsArea in the input.
    - If input[r][c] is not white (0):
        - Calculate the relative position (rel_r, rel_c) based on the top-left corners of the StampsArea's bounding box and the output grid (which corresponds to the CanvasArea's bounding box).
        - Set output[rel_r][rel_c] to azure (8).
    - White pixels from the StampsArea do not affect the output grid (the background color remains).
Relationships:
  - The output grid's size and background color are determined by the CanvasArea.
  - The output grid's foreground patterns are determined by the non-white pixels in the StampsArea.
  - The spatial arrangement of the foreground patterns in the output mirrors their arrangement within the StampsArea.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate the largest contiguous rectangular area composed of a single non-white color in the input grid; this is the "Canvas Area". Identify its color ("Canvas Color") and its dimensions (height H, width W). Find the bounding box containing all *other* non-white pixels in the input grid; this is the "Stamps Area".
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid (the "Output Grid") with dimensions H x W, and fill it entirely with the "Canvas Color".
3.  **Transfer Patterns:** Iterate through each cell within the bounding box of the "Stamps Area" in the input grid. Let the current input cell coordinates be `(r_in, c_in)` and its color be `input_color`.
4.  **Apply Color Rule:** If `input_color` is *not* white (0):
    *   Calculate the relative coordinates `(rel_r, rel_c)` of the cell within the "Stamps Area" (relative to its top-left corner).
    *   Ensure these relative coordinates `(rel_r, rel_c)` are within the bounds of the Output Grid (0 <= `rel_r` < H and 0 <= `rel_c` < W).
    *   If within bounds, set the color of the cell at `(rel_r, rel_c)` in the Output Grid to azure (8).
5.  **Finalize:** The resulting Output Grid is the final output.
