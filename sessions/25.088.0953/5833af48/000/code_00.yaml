Input:
  Structure: Contains two distinct non-white regions separated by white pixels.
  Region1:
    Name: StampsArea
    Content: Multiple small patterns (stamps).
    Colors: Primarily azure (8) and one other varying non-white color (e.g., red, green, yellow), plus white (0) background/separators.
    Location: Variable (often top or left).
  Region2:
    Name: CanvasArea
    Content: A single large solid rectangle.
    Colors: Uniformly filled with one non-white color (e.g., blue, green, yellow).
    Location: Variable (often bottom or right).
    Property: Largest contiguous monochromatic non-white object.
Output:
  Dimensions: Matches the dimensions of the CanvasArea from the input.
  BackgroundColor: Same as the color of the CanvasArea from the input.
  ForegroundContent: Patterns derived from the StampsArea.
Transformation:
  Action: Pattern Transfer and Color Replacement.
  Source: StampsArea.
  Target: CanvasArea.
  Mapping:
    - Find the bounding box of the CanvasArea.
    - Find the bounding box of the StampsArea.
    - Create an output grid with the dimensions of the CanvasArea, filled with the CanvasArea's color.
    - Iterate through each pixel (r, c) within the bounding box of the StampsArea in the input.
    - If input[r][c] is not white (0):
        - Calculate the relative position (rel_r, rel_c) based on the top-left corners of the StampsArea's bounding box and the output grid (which corresponds to the CanvasArea's bounding box).
        - Set output[rel_r][rel_c] to azure (8).
    - White pixels from the StampsArea do not affect the output grid (the background color remains).
Relationships:
  - The output grid's size and background color are determined by the CanvasArea.
  - The output grid's foreground patterns are determined by the non-white pixels in the StampsArea.
  - The spatial arrangement of the foreground patterns in the output mirrors their arrangement within the StampsArea.
