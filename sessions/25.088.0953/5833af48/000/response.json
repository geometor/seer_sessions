These patterns are primarily composed of azure (8) pixels and one other non-white color (e.g., red, green, yellow in the examples).\n    *   The other region is a large, solid rectangle filled with a single non-white color (\"canvas\"). The color of this canvas varies between examples (blue, green, yellow).\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid's dimensions match the dimensions of the \"canvas\" rectangle found in the input grid. The background color of the output grid is the same as the \"canvas\" color.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves transferring patterns from the \"stamps\" region onto the \"canvas\" region.\n    *   The relative positions of the patterns within the \"stamps\" region are preserved when applied to the output grid.\n    *   All non-white pixels found within the \"stamps\" region are mapped to the color azure (8) in the output grid. Pixels that were originally azure (8) remain azure (8). Other non-white pixels (red, green, yellow) are changed to azure (8).\n    *   White pixels from the \"stamps\" region are ignored, leaving the original canvas color in the corresponding output grid cell.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
