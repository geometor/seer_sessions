            "text": "Okay, the metrics code ran successfully this time.\n\n**Analysis of Metrics:**\n\n1.  **Canvas Identification**: The `find_largest_monochromatic_rect` function correctly identifies the large, solid-colored rectangle in each input:\n    *   Example 1: 8x16 blue (1) rectangle starting at (6, 1).\n    *   Example 2: 9x15 green (3) rectangle starting at (5, 1).\n    *   Example 3: 6x9 yellow (4) rectangle starting at (6, 3).\n    These match the dimensions and color of the main background of the expected outputs.\n\n2.  **Stamp Pixels**: The code correctly identifies pixels that are non-white and *not* part of the canvas rectangle (`input_stamp_pixels`).\n\n3.  **Relative Coordinates Mismatch**: The crucial finding is `relative_coords_match_azure: false` for all examples.\n    *   `num_stamps_on_output: 0` - My calculation logic for which stamp pixels should appear on the output grid based on relative coordinates seems flawed. The condition `0 <= rel_r < canvas_h and 0 <= rel_c < canvas_w` is not selecting *any* pixels. Why?\n        *   `rel_r = r - canvas_r`\n        *   `rel_c = c - canvas_c`\n        Looking at Example 1: Canvas starts at `r=6`. Stamp pixels are at `r=1, 2, 3, 4`. `rel_r` will be `1-6=-5`, `2-6=-4`, etc. These are *negative* and thus fail the `0 <= rel_r` check.\n    *   `missing_coords`: These are the coordinates (relative to the output grid's top-left) where azure (8) pixels *should* be according to the expected output.\n    *   `extra_coords`: Empty, confirming that my relative coordinate calculation didn't place any pixels onto the output.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:**\n\nThe relative positioning is not calculated from the canvas's top-left corner `(canvas_r, canvas_c)`.\n\nLet's reconsider the relationship between the input stamp area and the output.\nMaybe the relative positioning is based on the bounding box of the *stamps area*? The previous code tried this but failed. What was wrong with that?\n*   It used a *single* bounding box for *all* stamps.\n*   It mapped the top-left of this bounding box to the top-left (0,0) of the output grid.\n\nLet's re-examine Example 1:\n*   Canvas: (r=6, c=1), h=8, w=16, color=1 (blue)\n*   Output: 8x16 grid, mostly blue (1), with some azure (8) pixels.\n*   Input Stamps: Pixels in rows 1-4, columns 1-13. Colors are red (2), azure (8), blue (1). Note: some \"stamp\" pixels are blue (1), same as canvas! The definition should be \"non-white pixels outside the identified largest monochromatic rectangle\".\n*   Stamp pixels (non-white, outside canvas):\n    *   (1,1) Red\n    *   (1,2) Azure\n    *   (1,3) Red\n    *   (1,4) Red\n    *   (1,6) Blue -> Should this be a stamp? Yes, it's outside the (6,1)-(13,16) canvas.\n    *   ... lots of pixels ...\n    *   (4,13) Azure\n*   Expected Output Azure Pixels (relative coords): (0,5), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (4,1), (4,13), (5,0), (5,1), (5,12), (5,13), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,13), (6,14), (6,15), (7,1), (7,13).\n\nLet's look at the absolute coordinates of the *input* pixels that seem to correspond to the *output* azure pixels.\nIf output `(rel_r, rel_c)` corresponds to input `(r, c)`, maybe there's a fixed offset?\nOutput (0, 5) -> ?\nOutput (1, 4) -> ?\nOutput (4, 1) -> ? Input (1,1) is Red. Output (4,1) is Azure. Input (1,2) is Azure. Output (4,13) is Azure. Input (1,3) is Red.\nOutput (5, 0) -> ?\nOutput (5, 1) -> ? Input (2,1) is Azure.\nOutput (6, 1) -> ? Input (3,1) is Red. Output (6,2) -> ? Input (3,2) is Azure. Output (6,3) -> ? Input (3,3) is Azure.\nOutput (7, 1) -> ? Input (4,1) is Red.\n\nThis direct mapping isn't obvious.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure:\nInput: Area A (stamps), Area B (canvas).\nOutput: Area B' (same size/color as B), with pattern C (azure pixels).\n\nHow is pattern C derived from Area A?\nMaybe it's about the *relative* positions *within* Area A.\n\nLet's find the bounding box of the non-white pixels outside the canvas (the 'stamps').\nExample 1:\n*   Stamps are in rows 1-4 and columns 1-13.\n*   Bounding box: min_r=1, min_c=1, max_r=4, max_c=13. (Height=4, Width=13)\n*   The pattern within this bounding box needs to be transferred.\n\nHow does it transfer?\nPrevious code: `rel_r = r - min_r_stamp`, `rel_c = c - min_c_stamp`. Maps (1,1) -> (0,0).\nLet's trace `input(1,1)` which is Red(2). `rel_r=0`, `rel_c=0`. Does `output(0,0)` become azure? No, `output(0,0)` is blue(1).\nLet's trace `input(1,2)` which is Azure(8). `rel_r=0`, `rel_c=1`. Does `output(0,1)` become azure? No, blue(1).\nLet's trace `input(3,7)` which is Azure(8). `rel_r=2`, `rel_c=6`. Does `output(2,6)` become azure? Yes!\nLet's trace `input(3,12)` which is Blue(1). `rel_r=2`, `rel_c=11`. Does `output(2,11)` become azure? No, blue(1).\nLet's trace `input(3,13)` which is Azure(8). `rel_r=2`, `rel_c=12`. Does `output(2,12)` become azure? No, blue(1).\n\nThis mapping `(r - min_r_stamp, c - min_c_stamp)` isn't quite right either. The previous code *did* use this exact logic (`rel_r = r - min_r_stamp`, `rel_c = c - min_c_stamp`) but produced the wrong output. Why?\n\nLet's re-read the previous code's logic:\n"

So the code *did* implement the logic I thought it did (transferring the stamp bounding box content relative to its own top-left corner to the output grid's top-left corner).\n\n**Conclusion:** The hypothesis that the stamp pattern (defined by non-white pixels outside the canvas, within their collective bounding box) is transferred relative to the stamp bounding box top-left corner is INCORRECT.\n\n**New Hypothesis:** The transfer is relative to the *canvas* position, but only *if* the relative coordinate falls within the canvas bounds.\nLet's try this:\n1. Find canvas (r, c, h, w, color).\n2. Create output grid (h x w) filled with canvas color.\n3. Iterate through *all* input pixels `(in_r, in_c)` with `color != 0`.\n4. If the pixel `(in_r, in_c)` is *not* part of the canvas rectangle:\n    a. Calculate relative position: `rel_r = in_r - canvas_r`, `rel_c = in_c - canvas_c`.\n    b. If `0 <= rel_r < canvas_h` and `0 <= rel_c < canvas_w`:\n        c. Set `output_grid[rel_r, rel_c] = 8` (azure).\n\nLet's test this on Example 1:\n*   Canvas: (r=6, c=1), h=8, w=16, color=1. Output is 8x16 filled with 1.\n*   Stamp pixel `input(1,1)` = Red(2). Outside canvas. `rel_r = 1-6 = -5`. `rel_c = 1-1 = 0`. Fails `0 <= rel_r` check. No change to output.\n*   Stamp pixel `input(1,6)` = Blue(1). Outside canvas. `rel_r = 1-6 = -5`. `rel_c = 6-1 = 5`. Fails `0 <= rel_r`. No change.\n*   Stamp pixel `input(3,7)` = Azure(8). Outside canvas. `rel_r = 3-6 = -3`. `rel_c = 7-1 = 6`. Fails `0 <= rel_r`. No change.\n\nThis doesn't work either. The relative coordinates are negative because the stamps are *above* the canvas.\n\nWhat if the relative offset isn't `(canvas_r, canvas_c)`?\nWhat if the offset is determined differently?\n\nConsider the overall input grid structure. There's a block of 'stamps' and a block of 'canvas'. They might be separated by white space.\nMaybe the relative positioning is between the *top-left corner of the stamp bounding box* and the *top-left corner of the canvas*?\n\nExample 1:\n*   Canvas TL: (6, 1)\n*   Stamp BBox TL: (1, 1)\n*   Offset Vector (Canvas TL - Stamp BBox TL): `(6-1, 1-1) = (5, 0)`\n\nHypothesis 3:\n1. Find canvas (canvas_r, canvas_c, h, w, color).\n2. Create output grid (h x w) filled with canvas color.\n3. Find bounding box of all non-white pixels *outside* the canvas (stamp_min_r, stamp_min_c, stamp_max_r, stamp_max_c).\n4. Calculate offset: `offset_r = canvas_r - stamp_min_r`, `offset_c = canvas_c - stamp_min_c`.\n5. Iterate through all input pixels `(in_r, in_c)` within the stamp bounding box (`stamp_min_r <= in_r <= stamp_max_r`, `stamp_min_c <= in_c <= stamp_max_c`).\n6. If `input_grid[in_r, in_c]` is non-white AND *not* part of the canvas rectangle:\n    a. Calculate target coordinates in the output grid: `target_r = in_r - stamp_min_r + offset_r`? No, that simplifies to `canvas_r`. Wait. `target_r = in_r + offset_r`? No.\n    Let's try mapping the relative position within the stamp box to a position relative to the canvas origin + offset.\n    `rel_stamp_r = in_r - stamp_min_r`\n    `rel_stamp_c = in_c - stamp_min_c`\n    Target position in output: `target_r = rel_stamp_r + offset_r`? `target_c = rel_stamp_c + offset_c`?\n    Let's test this mapping: `target_r = (in_r - stamp_min_r) + (canvas_r - stamp_min_r)` - No.\n    Try: `target_r = in_r - canvas_r`? No, we know that's wrong.\n    Try: `target_r = in_r - stamp_min_r`? Maps stamp pixel (stamp_min_r, stamp_min_c) to (0,0) in output? Doesn't match expected.\n\nMaybe the offset is applied differently. What if we map the input stamp pixel `(in_r, in_c)` to `output(in_r + offset_r, in_c + offset_c)`?\nLet `offset_r = canvas_r - stamp_min_r` and `offset_c = canvas_c - stamp_min_c`.\nExample 1: `offset = (5, 0)`.\n*   Input stamp `(1, 1)` Red -> Target `(1+5, 1+0) = (6, 1)`. Is `output(6, 1)` azure? Yes! `(6,1)` is in `missing_coords`.\n*   Input stamp `(1, 2)` Azure -> Target `(1+5, 2+0) = (6, 2)`. Is `output(6, 2)` azure? Yes! `(6,2)` is in `missing_coords`.\n*   Input stamp `(1, 3)` Red -> Target `(1+5, 3+0) = (6, 3)`. Is `output(6, 3)` azure? Yes! `(6,3)` is in `missing_coords`.\n*   Input stamp `(1, 6)` Blue -> Target `(1+5, 6+0) = (6, 6)`. Is `output(6, 6)` azure? No, it's blue(1). This pixel `(1,6)` *was* blue. Maybe only non-canvas-color stamps are transferred? No, the blue pixel `input(1,8)` (Azure) becomes `output(6, 8)` Azure.\n*   Wait, `is_stamp_pixel` check: `input_color != 0` AND *not* part of canvas rectangle. So `input(1,6)` (Blue) *is* a stamp pixel. Why doesn't it become Azure?\n    *   Maybe the rule is: Find canvas. Output = canvas size/color. Find stamp bounding box. Calculate offset = canvas_TL - stamp_bbox_TL. For each pixel `(in_r, in_c)` in stamp bbox: if `input(in_r, in_c)` is non-white and not on canvas rectangle, calculate `target_r = in_r + offset_r`, `target_c = in_c + offset_c`. If target coords are within output bounds, set `output(target_r, target_c) = 8`.\n\nLet's re-test this revised Hypothesis 3:\nExample 1: `offset = (5, 0)`. Output is 8x16 filled with 1.\n*   Input `(1, 1)` Red(2). Is stamp. Target `(6, 1)`. In bounds (0<=6<8, 0<=1<16). Set `output(6, 1) = 8`. Matches expected!\n*   Input `(1, 2)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(6, 2)`. In bounds. Set `output(6, 2) = 8`. Matches expected!\n*   Input `(1, 3)` Red(2). Is stamp. Target `(6, 3)`. In bounds. Set `output(6, 3) = 8`. Matches expected!\n*   Input `(1, 4)` Red(2). Is stamp. Target `(6, 4)`. In bounds. Set `output(6, 4) = 8`. Expected is blue(1). Mismatch!\n*   Input `(1, 5)` White(0). Not stamp. Skip.\n*   Input `(1, 6)` Blue(1). Is stamp. Target `(6, 6)`. In bounds. Set `output(6, 6) = 8`. Expected is blue(1). Mismatch!\n*   Input `(1, 7)` Blue(1). Is stamp. Target `(6, 7)`. In bounds. Set `output(6, 7) = 8`. Expected is blue(1). Mismatch!\n*   Input `(1, 8)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(6, 8)`. In bounds. Set `output(6, 8) = 8`. Matches expected!\n\nThis hypothesis is also flawed. The transformation isn't simply transferring all non-white stamp pixels with an offset.\n\nLet's rethink the \"Stamp\" definition. Maybe it's not *all* non-white pixels outside the canvas. Maybe it's only pixels of certain colors? Or maybe it's only *contiguous objects* outside the canvas?\n\nLet's look at the colors involved:\n*   Ex 1: Canvas=Blue(1). Stamps have Red(2), Azure(8), Blue(1). Output stamps = Azure(8).\n*   Ex 2: Canvas=Green(3). Stamps have Red(2), Azure(8), Green(3). Output stamps = Azure(8).\n*   Ex 3: Canvas=Yellow(4). Stamps have Red(2), Azure(8), Yellow(4). Output stamps = Azure(8).\n\nIt seems consistent that the output stamp color is always Azure(8).\nIt also seems consistent that the pixels being stamped correspond to input pixels that were *not* white(0) and *not* part of the main canvas rectangle. The blue(1) pixels in Ex1's stamp area and the green(3) in Ex2's stamp area *should* participate according to this rule.\n\nWhat if the offset calculation is wrong?\nExample 1: Canvas TL (6, 1). Stamp BBox TL (1, 1). Offset (5, 0).\nExample 2: Canvas TL (5, 1). Stamp BBox TL (1, 1). Offset (4, 0).\nExample 3: Canvas TL (6, 3). Stamp BBox TL (1, 0). Offset (5, 3).\n\nLet's apply Hypothesis 3 (Offset = CanvasTL - StampTL) to Example 3:\n*   Canvas: (r=6, c=3), h=6, w=9, color=4(Yellow). Output 6x9 filled with 4.\n*   Stamps: Non-white outside canvas. BBox TL = (1, 0).\n*   Offset: `(6-1, 3-0) = (5, 3)`.\n*   Input `(1, 0)` Red(2). Is stamp. Target `(1+5, 0+3) = (6, 3)`. Out of bounds (max row index is 5).\n*   Input `(1, 1)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(1+5, 1+3) = (6, 4)`. Out of bounds.\n*   Input `(2, 0)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(2+5, 0+3) = (7, 3)`. Out of bounds.\n*   Input `(3, 0)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(3+5, 0+3) = (8, 3)`. Out of bounds.\n*   Input `(1, 4)` Yellow(4). Is stamp. Target `(1+5, 4+3) = (6, 7)`. Out of bounds.\n*   Input `(1, 6)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(1+5, 6+3) = (6, 9)`. Out of bounds (max col index is 8).\n\nThis offset calculation seems fundamentally wrong or the mapping method is wrong.\n\nBack to basics: What is constant?\nOutput grid size = Canvas grid size.\nOutput grid background color = Canvas color.\nOutput stamp color = Azure (8).\n\nWhat varies? The locations of the Azure pixels.\n\nLet `f(in_r, in_c) -> (out_r, out_c)` be the mapping function for a stamp pixel.\nWe need to find `f` and the condition under which `output[f(in_r, in_c)]` becomes 8.\n\nConsider the relationship between the *entire* input grid and the output grid.\nMaybe it's a simple overlay?\nIf we take the canvas rectangle from the input `input[canvas_r:canvas_r+h, canvas_c:canvas_c+w]` and overlay the stamp pattern onto it somehow?\n\nLet's look at the *relative structure* of the stamps.\nExample 1: Stamps are in rows 1-4. Canvas starts row 6. Gap of 1 row (row 5).\nExample 2: Stamps are in rows 1-3. Canvas starts row 5. Gap of 1 row (row 4).\nExample 3: Stamps are in rows 1-4. Canvas starts row 6. Gap of 1 row (row 5).\n\nIs there a consistent vertical shift?\nEx 1: Stamps end row 4, Canvas starts row 6. Shift = `canvas_r - (stamp_max_r + 1) = 6 - (4+1) = 1`? No.\nShift = `canvas_r - stamp_min_r = 6 - 1 = 5`. We tested this offset. Failed.\n\nWhat if the output grid isn't just the canvas? What if it's a crop or view?\nNo, the output size perfectly matches the canvas size.\n\nCould it be related to the center or some other anchor point?\n\nLet's re-examine the first successful transformation: `input(3,7)` (Azure) maps to `output(2,6)` (Azure). How?\nCanvas TL: (6, 1). Stamp BBox TL: (1, 1).\nMaybe the mapping is relative to the *bounding box* of the stamps, but placed at a *specific location* in the output grid?\nMap `(in_r, in_c)` -> `(in_r - stamp_min_r, in_c - stamp_min_c)`?\nInput (3, 7) -> `(3-1, 7-1) = (2, 6)`. This matches `output(2, 6)`!\n\nLet's test this: **Hypothesis 4**\n1. Find canvas (r, c, h, w, color).\n2. Create output grid (h x w) filled with canvas color.\n3. Find bounding box of all non-white pixels *outside* the canvas (stamp_min_r, stamp_min_c, stamp_max_r, stamp_max_c).\n4. Iterate through input pixels `(in_r, in_c)` in the stamp bounding box.\n5. If `input_grid[in_r, in_c]` is non-white AND *not* part of the canvas rectangle:\n    a. Calculate target coordinates relative to the stamp bounding box TL: `target_r = in_r - stamp_min_r`, `target_c = in_c - stamp_min_c`.\n    b. If target coords `(target_r, target_c)` are within the output grid bounds (`0 <= target_r < h`, `0 <= target_c < w`):\n        c. Set `output_grid[target_r, target_c] = 8`.\n\nTesting Hypothesis 4 on Example 1:\n*   Canvas h=8, w=16. Output 8x16 filled with 1.\n*   Stamp BBox TL = (1, 1).\n*   Input `(1, 1)` Red(2). Is stamp. Target `(1-1, 1-1) = (0, 0)`. In bounds. `output(0, 0) = 8`. Expected: 1. Fail.\n*   Input `(3, 7)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(3-1, 7-1) = (2, 6)`. In bounds. `output(2, 6) = 8`. Expected: 8. Match!\n*   Input `(4, 13)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(4-1, 13-1) = (3, 12)`. In bounds. `output(3, 12) = 8`. Expected: 1. Fail.\n\nThis is exactly the logic the failed code implemented! I simulated it correctly before, and it produced the wrong output grid shown in the results. Why did my manual trace just now seem different? Let's re-trace `input(1,1)` Red(2).\n`in_r=1, in_c=1`. `stamp_min_r=1, stamp_min_c=1`. `target_r=0, target_c=0`. `output[0,0]=8`.\nThis *is* what the failed code produces (top-left 8). But the expected output top-left is 1.\n\nWhat is different between `input(3,7)` (maps correctly) and `input(1,1)` or `input(4,13)` (map incorrectly)?\n\nCould the definition of \"stamp pixel\" be wrong?\nMaybe it's *only* the azure (8) pixels outside the canvas?\nHypothesis 5: Like Hypothesis 4, but only map pixels where `input_grid[in_r, in_c] == 8`.\nTesting Hypothesis 5 on Example 1:\n*   Canvas h=8, w=16. Output 8x16 filled with 1. Stamp BBox TL = (1, 1).\n*   Input `(1, 1)` Red(2). Skip (not Azure).\n*   Input `(1, 2)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(1-1, 1-1) = (0, 1)`. In bounds. `output(0, 1) = 8`. Expected: 1. Fail.\n*   Input `(3, 7)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(3-1, 7-1) = (2, 6)`. In bounds. `output(2, 6) = 8`. Expected: 8. Match!\n*   Input `(4, 13)` Azure(8). Is stamp. Target `(4-1, 13-1) = (3, 12)`. In bounds. `output(3, 12) = 8`. Expected: 1. Fail.\n\nStill not right.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the \"Stamp Area\" isn't defined by *all* non-canvas, non-white pixels. What if it's only a specific object or set of objects?\nIn Ex 1, there are reddish shapes and bluish shapes above the canvas.\nIn Ex 2, reddish shapes and greenish shapes.\nIn Ex 3, reddish shapes and yellowish shapes.\n\nWhat if the task is to find the \"pattern\" defined by Azure(8) pixels located *outside* the main canvas?\nHypothesis 6:\n1. Find canvas (r, c, h, w, color).\n2. Create output grid (h x w) filled with canvas color.\n3. Find all Azure(8) pixels `(in_r, in_c)` in the input grid that are *not* part of the canvas rectangle.\n4. Find the bounding box of *these specific Azure pixels* (azure_min_r, azure_min_c, ...).\n5. Iterate through only these Azure pixels `(in_r, in_c)`.\n    a. Calculate target coordinates relative to the Azure bounding box TL: `target_r = in_r - azure_min_r`, `target_c = in_c - azure_min_c`.\n    b. If target coords `(target_r, target_c)` are within the output grid bounds (`0 <= target_r < h`, `0 <= target_c < w`):\n        c. Set `output_grid[target_r, target_c] = 8`.\n\nTesting Hypothesis 6 on Example 1:\n*   Canvas h=8, w=16. Output 8x16 filled with 1.\n*   Azure pixels outside canvas: (1,2), (1,8), (1,9), (1,12), (1,13), (2,1), (2,2), (2,8), (2,9), (2,12), (2,13), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7), (3,12), (3,"
