task_description: Stamp a pattern centered on each green pixel and draw horizontal red lines based on green pixel locations, with specific overwrite rules.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - grid_size: Variable (up to 30x30)

objects:
  - object: green_pixel
    color: 3 (green)
    property: location (row, column)
    role: trigger for pattern placement and line drawing

  - object: stamp_pattern
    size: 5x5 relative to center
    colors_used: [2 (red), 3 (green), 5 (gray), 8 (azure), 0 (white)]
    structure: Fixed spatial arrangement of colors relative to the center green pixel.
    property: centered_on: green_pixel location

  - object: horizontal_red_line
    color: 2 (red)
    property: row_index: derived from green_pixel row (r+2)
    property: length: spans the full width of the grid

actions:
  - action: find_green_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: list of coordinates (r, c) of all green pixels

  - action: place_stamp
    input: output_grid, center_coordinate (r, c)
    effect: Overwrites pixels in the output_grid with the stamp_pattern centered at (r, c). Records the locations of azure (8) pixels placed.

  - action: draw_red_line
    input: output_grid, row_index R, set_of_azure_pixels
    effect: Iterates through columns C of row R. If (R, C) is not in set_of_azure_pixels, sets output_grid[R, C] to red (2).

relationships:
  - relationship: one_to_one
    subject: green_pixel
    verb: triggers
    object: stamp_pattern placement (centered on green_pixel)
  - relationship: one_to_one
    subject: green_pixel at (r, c)
    verb: determines
    object: horizontal_red_line row index (r+2)
  - relationship: overwrite_priority
    subject: horizontal_red_line
    verb: does not overwrite
    object: azure (8) pixels originating from any stamp_pattern
