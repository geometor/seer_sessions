            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids are mostly white (0) with one or more isolated green (3) pixels.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids retain the original green pixels but add complex patterns around them. The background remains white where no patterns are added.\n3.  **Pattern:** A consistent, complex pattern appears centered around each original green pixel. This pattern seems to be a fixed \"stamp\".\n4.  **Stamp Details:** Let the green pixel be at `(r, c)`. The stamp affects a region roughly from `(r-2, c-2)` to `(r+2, c+2)`.\n    *   Row `r-2`: A horizontal line of gray (5) pixels from `c-2` to `c+2`.\n    *   Row `r-1`: Red (2) at `(r-1, c-2)`, gray (5) at `(r-1, c)`, red (2) at `(r-1, c+2)`. White (0) elsewhere in this row within the stamp's bounds.\n    *   Row `r`: Red (2) at `(r, c-2)`, the original green (3) at `(r, c)`, red (2) at `(r, c+2)`. White (0) elsewhere.\n    *   Row `r+1`: Red (2) at `(r+1, c-2)` and `(r+1, c+2)`. White (0) elsewhere.\n    *   Row `r+2`: A horizontal line of azure (8) pixels from `c-2` to `c+2`.\n5.  **Horizontal Lines:** In addition to the stamps, horizontal lines of red (2) pixels are drawn across the *entire width* of the grid. The row index for each red line seems related to the row index of a green pixel. Specifically, for a green pixel at `(r, c)`, a red line appears at row `r+2`.\n6.  **Interaction/Overlap:** When multiple green pixels exist (Example 1), multiple stamps are placed, and multiple red lines are drawn. The key observation is how the red lines interact with the stamps. The red line at `r+2` overwrites existing pixels *except* for the azure (8) pixels that are part of *any* stamp pattern located at that same row `r+2`.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
