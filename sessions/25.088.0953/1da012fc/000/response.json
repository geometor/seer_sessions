            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids containing pixels of different colors.\n2.  **Key Objects:**\n    *   **Frame:** A prominent rectangular object, consistently gray (5) in the examples, appears in both input and output. It seems to act as a container or reference area.\n    *   **Indicator Pixels:** Inside the gray frame, there are distinct, often single, non-background, non-frame colored pixels (e.g., red, green, yellow in train\\_1; red, yellow, magenta, green in train\\_2). These pixels remain unchanged in the output.\n    *   **Target Objects:** Outside the gray frame, there are several monochromatic objects (all azure (8) in train\\_1, all blue (1) in train\\_2). These objects *change color* in the output, but their shapes and positions remain the same.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the 'Target Objects'. The *new* color for each target object appears to be determined by one of the 'Indicator Pixels' inside the frame.\n4.  **Mapping Logic:** The mapping between target objects and indicator pixel colors seems based on order. When both the target objects (based on their top-left position) and the indicator pixels (based on their position) are sorted (primarily by row, then by column), the color of the i-th indicator pixel is assigned to the i-th target object. The number of target objects matches the number of indicator pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Verify they all share the same initial color. Store each target object (as a set of pixel coordinates) and the location of its top-leftmost pixel.\n6.  Sort the identified indicator pixels based on their location, primarily by row index (top-to-bottom) and secondarily by column index (left-to-right).

Sort the identified target objects based on the location of their top-leftmost pixel, primarily by row index (top-to-bottom) and secondarily by column index (left-to-right).
