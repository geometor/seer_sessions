The input grid typically contains a top row with some azure (8) pixels, a solid horizontal line of gray (5) pixels somewhere below the middle, and a row near the bottom containing a sequence of various colors. The output grid retains most of the input structure but adds vertical colored lines in the space above the gray line. The color and column position of these new lines are determined by the color sequence row near the bottom. The height of these new lines is determined by the count of azure pixels in the top row.\n\n*   **YAML:**\n    "
