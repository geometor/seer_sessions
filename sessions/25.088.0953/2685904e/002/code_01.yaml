grid_properties:
  - name: height_control_row
    description: The first row (index 0) of the input grid.
    properties: Contains azure (8) and white (0) pixels.
    role: Determines the height 'H' of the vertical lines to be drawn. H is the count of azure pixels in this row.
  - name: anchor_row
    description: The first row found (scanning top-to-bottom) that consists entirely of gray (5) pixels.
    properties: Index denoted as 'R_anchor'. All pixels are gray.
    role: Acts as a vertical reference point for drawing. Lines end just above this row.
  - name: source_row
    description: The last row found (scanning bottom-to-top) that contains at least one non-white (0) pixel.
    properties: Index denoted as 'R_source'. Contains various non-white pixels that are candidates for drawing.
    role: Provides the colors and column positions for potential drawing operations, and serves as the basis for the color filtering rule.
  - name: drawing_area
    description: The area of the grid above the anchor_row.
    properties: Initially mostly white (0), except for the height_control_row. Modified in the output.
    role: Location where vertical lines are drawn.

objects:
  - name: vertical_line
    description: A column segment of a single color.
    properties:
      - color: Determined by a pixel in the source_row.
      - column_index: Same as the column index of the determining pixel in the source_row.
      - height: Equal to 'H' (derived from height_control_row).
      - vertical_position: Extends upwards from row R_anchor - 1 for H rows (inclusive range: [R_anchor - H, R_anchor - 1]).

actions:
  - name: identify_parameters
    description: Extract control values from the input grid.
    steps:
      - Count azure (8) pixels in height_control_row to get height 'H'.
      - Find the row index 'R_anchor' of the anchor_row.
      - Find the row index 'R_source' of the source_row.
  - name: calculate_frequencies
    description: Determine how many times each non-white color appears in the source_row.
    inputs: source_row (at R_source)
    outputs: A map of {color: frequency}.
  - name: filter_colors
    description: Select which colors from the source_row will trigger drawing.
    inputs:
      - Color frequencies from calculate_frequencies.
      - Height 'H'.
    outputs: A set of 'selected_colors'.
    rule: A color 'C' is selected if its frequency in the source_row equals 'H'.
  - name: draw_lines
    description: Modify the output grid by drawing vertical lines based on filtered colors.
    inputs:
      - Input grid (as basis for output).
      - R_anchor, R_source, H.
      - selected_colors.
    process:
      - Iterate through each column 'c' from 0 to width-1.
      - Get the color 'C' at input_grid[R_source, c].
      - If 'C' is in selected_colors:
        - For each row 'r' from R_anchor - H to R_anchor - 1 (inclusive):
          - Set output_grid[r, c] = C.
      - Otherwise, the output grid retains the input grid's values in that column's drawing area.

output_generation:
  - Create a copy of the input grid.
  - Perform the 'draw_lines' action on the copy.
  - Return the modified grid.
