The height parameter `H` is derived from the count of azure (8) pixels in the first row (Row 0).\n2.  An \"anchor\" row (`R_anchor`), the first row composed entirely of gray (5) pixels, serves as a vertical reference.\n3.  A \"source\" row (`R_source`), the last row containing any non-white (0) pixel, provides the colors and column positions for potential drawing operations.\n4.  The drawing operation involves creating vertical lines of height `H` ending one row above the anchor row (`R_anchor - 1`).\n\nHowever, the code incorrectly assumed that *all* non-white colors found in the source row should be used to draw lines. The analysis of the failed examples reveals that a specific filtering condition is missing. By comparing the colors present in the source row (`R_source`) with the colors actually drawn in the expected outputs, and correlating this with the height parameter `H`, a new rule emerges: A color `C` from the source row is only used to draw a vertical line if the total number of times `C` appears in the source row is exactly equal to `H`.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is to modify the code to:\n1.  Calculate the frequency of each non-white color within the identified source row (`R_source`).\n2.  Compare these frequencies to the calculated height `H`.\n3.  Only proceed with drawing a vertical line in column `c` using color `C = input[R_source, c]` if `C` is non-white *and* its frequency in `R_source` equals `H`.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using code execution to verify the refined hypothesis:\n\n"
