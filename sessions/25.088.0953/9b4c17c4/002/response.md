**General Assessment**

The provided code correctly identifies the red objects (color 2) and can determine the background color (blue=1 or azure=8) and the horizontal extent of the contiguous background region containing each object. However, the core logic for determining the direction of movement was flawed. The previous code assumed objects move towards the *closest* horizontal boundary of their background region. The analysis of the failed examples reveals this is incorrect. The direction of movement appears to be fixed for each background color: objects in blue regions move right, and objects in azure regions move left, irrespective of their position within the region or proximity to boundaries. The task requires recalculating the movement based on this new rule.

**Metrics and Analysis**

The previous code failed on all examples because its core movement logic was incorrect.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Blue Region (Top, Cols 0-14): Contains Obj1 (C:3-4) and Obj2 (C:7-9).
        *   Expected: Both move Right (towards Col 14). Obj1 -> C:13-14, Obj2 -> C:12-14.
        *   Code: Obj1 moved Left (closer boundary), Obj2 moved Right (closer boundary). **Obj1 incorrect.**
    *   Azure Region (Bottom, Cols 0-14): Contains Obj3 (C:2) and Obj4 (C:7-9).
        *   Expected: Both move Left (towards Col 0). Obj3 -> C:0, Obj4 -> C:0-2.
        *   Code: Obj3 moved Left (closer boundary), Obj4 moved Right (closer boundary). **Obj4 incorrect.**
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Blue Region (Left, Cols 0-6): Contains Obj1 (C:2-3) and Obj2 (C:2-4).
        *   Expected: Both move Right (towards Col 6). Obj1 -> C:5-6, Obj2 -> C:4-6.
        *   Code: Obj1 moved Left (closer boundary), Obj2 moved Left (tied, chose left). **Both incorrect.**
    *   Azure Region (Right, Cols 7-12): Contains Obj3 (C:9-10) and Obj4 (C:8-9).
        *   Expected: Both move Left (towards Col 7). Obj3 -> C:7-8, Obj4 -> C:7-8.
        *   Code: Obj3 moved Left (tied, chose left), Obj4 moved Left (closer boundary). **Both correct** (coincidentally, as 'closer' matched 'left').
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Azure Region (Left, Cols 0-5): Contains three objects.
        *   Expected: All move Left (towards Col 0).
        *   Code: Moved based on proximity, resulting in some objects moving left and potentially others right if they were closer to the right boundary (Col 5). Errors observed confirm this mismatch.
    *   Blue Region (Right, Cols 6-13): Contains three objects.
        *   Expected: All move Right (towards Col 13).
        *   Code: Moved based on proximity. Errors observed confirm this mismatch.
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Azure Region (Top, Cols 0-10): Contains two objects.
        *   Expected: Both move Left (towards Col 0).
        *   Code: Moved based on proximity. Errors observed confirm this mismatch.
    *   Blue Region (Bottom, Cols 0-10): Contains two objects.
        *   Expected: Both move Right (towards Col 10).
        *   Code: Moved based on proximity. Errors observed confirm this mismatch.

**Conclusion:** The direction of movement is determined by the background color, not proximity. Blue background implies moving right; Azure background implies moving left.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Context:
  - The grid is composed of distinct background regions and objects within them.
  - Background regions are contiguous areas of either Blue (1) or Azure (8).
  - Objects are contiguous areas of Red (2).
  - Each red object resides entirely within one background region.

Objects:
  - type: background_region
    color: Blue (1) or Azure (8)
    properties:
      - contiguous_area
      - horizontal_boundaries: [min_column, max_column]
      - color
  - type: object
    color: Red (2)
    properties:
      - contiguous_area
      - location: set of (row, col) coordinates
      - horizontal_boundaries: [min_column, max_column]
      - parent_region: the background_region containing the object

Actions:
  - Identify all distinct background_regions (Blue and Azure).
  - For each background_region:
    - Determine its color and horizontal_boundaries [region_min_col, region_max_col].
    - Find all red objects located within this region.
    - Determine the movement direction based *only* on the region's background color:
      - If color is Blue (1), direction is Right.
      - If color is Azure (8), direction is Left.
    - For each red object within this region:
      - Get the object's horizontal_boundaries [object_min_col, object_max_col].
      - If direction is Right:
        - Calculate shift: region_max_col - object_max_col
      - If direction is Left:
        - Calculate shift: region_min_col - object_min_col (will be negative or zero)
      - Apply the calculated horizontal shift to all coordinates of the object.
  - Construct the output grid by placing the shifted objects onto the original background. Erase objects from their original positions.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct, contiguous background regions composed solely of Blue (1) pixels or Azure (8) pixels. Record the coordinates belonging to each region.
3.  Identify all distinct, contiguous objects composed of Red (2) pixels. Record the coordinates belonging to each object.
4.  For each identified red object:
    a.  Determine which background region it belongs to (e.g., by checking the color of a neighbor pixel or finding the region containing the object's coordinates).
    b.  Retrieve the color (Blue or Azure) and the minimum and maximum column indices (`region_min_col`, `region_max_col`) of that specific background region.
    c.  Find the minimum and maximum column indices occupied by the red object (`object_min_col`, `object_max_col`).
    d.  Determine the target horizontal shift based on the background color:
        i.  If the background region color is Blue (1), the object must move Right. Calculate the shift amount as `shift = region_max_col - object_max_col`.
        ii. If the background region color is Azure (8), the object must move Left. Calculate the shift amount as `shift = region_min_col - object_min_col`.
    e.  If the calculated `shift` is not zero:
        i.  First, erase the object from its original position in the output grid by setting the corresponding pixels to the background color determined in step 4b.
        ii. Then, draw the object in its new position in the output grid by adding the `shift` amount to the column coordinate of each pixel of the object and setting the color to Red (2).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
