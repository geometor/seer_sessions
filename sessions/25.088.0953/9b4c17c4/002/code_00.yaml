Context:
  - The grid is composed of distinct background regions and objects within them.
  - Background regions are contiguous areas of either Blue (1) or Azure (8).
  - Objects are contiguous areas of Red (2).
  - Each red object resides entirely within one background region.

Objects:
  - type: background_region
    color: Blue (1) or Azure (8)
    properties:
      - contiguous_area
      - horizontal_boundaries: [min_column, max_column]
      - color
  - type: object
    color: Red (2)
    properties:
      - contiguous_area
      - location: set of (row, col) coordinates
      - horizontal_boundaries: [min_column, max_column]
      - parent_region: the background_region containing the object

Actions:
  - Identify all distinct background_regions (Blue and Azure).
  - For each background_region:
    - Determine its color and horizontal_boundaries [region_min_col, region_max_col].
    - Find all red objects located within this region.
    - Determine the movement direction based *only* on the region's background color:
      - If color is Blue (1), direction is Right.
      - If color is Azure (8), direction is Left.
    - For each red object within this region:
      - Get the object's horizontal_boundaries [object_min_col, object_max_col].
      - If direction is Right:
        - Calculate shift: region_max_col - object_max_col
      - If direction is Left:
        - Calculate shift: region_min_col - object_min_col (will be negative or zero)
      - Apply the calculated horizontal shift to all coordinates of the object.
  - Construct the output grid by placing the shifted objects onto the original background. Erase objects from their original positions.
