            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code correctly identifies the red objects (color 2) and can determine the background color (blue=1 or azure=8) and the horizontal extent of the contiguous background region containing each object. However, the core logic for determining the direction of movement was flawed. The previous code assumed objects move towards the *closest* horizontal boundary of their background region. The analysis of the failed examples reveals this is incorrect. The direction of movement appears to be fixed for each background color: objects in blue regions move right, and objects in azure regions move left, irrespective of their position within the region or proximity to boundaries. The task requires recalculating the movement based on this new rule.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nThe previous code failed on all examples because its core movement logic was incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Blue Region (Top, Cols 0-14): Contains Obj1 (C:3-4) and Obj2 (C:7-9).\n        *   Expected: Both move Right (towards Col 14). Obj1 -> C:13-14, Obj2 -> C:12-14.\n        *   Code: Obj1 moved Left (closer boundary), Obj2 moved Right (closer boundary). **Obj1 incorrect.**\n    *   Azure Region (Bottom, Cols 0-14): Contains Obj3 (C:2) and Obj4 (C:7-9).\n        *   Expected: Both move Left (towards Col 0). Obj3 -> C:0, Obj4 -> C:0-2.\n        *   Code: Obj3 moved Left (closer boundary), Obj4 moved Right (closer boundary). **Obj4 incorrect.**\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Blue Region (Left, Cols 0-6): Contains Obj1 (C:2-3) and Obj2 (C:2-4).\n        *   Expected: Both move Right (towards Col 6). Obj1 -> C:5-6, Obj2 -> C:4-6.\n        *   Code: Obj1 moved Left (closer boundary), Obj2 moved Left (tied, chose left). **Both incorrect.**\n    *   Azure Region (Right, Cols 7-12): Contains Obj3 (C:9-10) and Obj4 (C:8-9).\n        *   Expected: Both move Left (towards Col 7). Obj3 -> C:7-8, Obj4 -> C:7-8.\n        *   Code: Obj3 moved Left (tied, chose left), Obj4 moved Left (closer boundary). **Both correct** (coincidentally, as 'closer' matched 'left').\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Azure Region (Left, Cols 0-5): Contains three objects.\n        *   Expected: All move Left (towards Col 0).\n        *   Code: Moved based on proximity, resulting in some objects moving left and potentially others right if they were closer to the right boundary (Col 5). Errors observed confirm this mismatch.\n    *   Blue Region (Right, Cols 6-13): Contains three objects.\n        *   Expected: All move Right (towards Col 13).\n        *   Code: Moved based on proximity. Errors observed confirm this mismatch.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Azure Region (Top, Cols 0-10): Contains two objects.\n        *   Expected: Both move Left (towards Col 0).\n        *   Code: Moved based on proximity. Errors observed confirm this mismatch.\n    *   Blue Region (Bottom, Cols 0-10): Contains two objects.\n        *   Expected: Both move Right (towards Col 10).\n        *   Code: Moved based on proximity. Errors observed confirm this mismatch.\n\n**Conclusion:** The direction of movement is determined by the background color, not proximity. Blue background implies moving right; Azure background implies moving left.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
