elements:
  - role: background
    colors: [1, 8] # blue, azure
    properties:
      - forms contiguous regions
      - static (do not move or change color)
  - role: object
    colors: [2] # red
    properties:
      - contiguous shapes (often rectangles)
      - exist within a single background region
      - mobile
actions:
  - name: horizontal_slide
    target: object (red pixels)
    constraints:
      - movement is purely horizontal
      - occurs within the boundaries of the object's background region
    trigger:
      - proximity to vertical boundaries of the region
    rule:
      - calculate distance from object's left edge to region's left boundary
      - calculate distance from object's right edge to region's right boundary
      - move object towards the closer boundary
      - stop when any part of the object touches the boundary
relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: object (red pixels)
    object: background region
    description: Each red object is fully contained within a region defined by a single background color (blue or azure).
  - type: boundary
    subject: background region
    object: grid edges or other background regions
    description: Background regions have vertical boundaries defined by the grid edges or transitions to regions of a different background color.
