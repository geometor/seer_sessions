            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure & Colors:** The input grids contain distinct regions defined by background colors, primarily blue (1) and azure (8). Within these regions, there are objects composed of red (2) pixels.\n2.  **Objects:** The red objects are typically rectangular shapes of varying sizes, sometimes just single pixels. They exist entirely within one of the background-colored regions.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the red objects horizontally within their respective background regions. The background regions themselves remain static.\n4.  **Movement Logic:** The direction and distance of movement seem determined by the object's proximity to the horizontal boundaries of its containing region. Objects slide towards the *nearest* vertical edge (either the grid's edge or the boundary between different background regions) until they touch that edge. They do not move vertically.\n5.  **Consistency:** This \"slide to nearest edge\" rule appears consistent across all four training examples, regardless of whether the regions are arranged top-bottom or left-right.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all distinct, contiguous objects composed of red (color 2) pixels in the input grid.\n3.  For each identified red object:\n    a.  Determine the background color (blue (1) or azure (8)) of the region immediately surrounding the object.\n    b.  Identify the full extent of this contiguous background region. Determine its leftmost column index (`region_min_col`) and rightmost column index (`region_max_col`).\n    c.  Determine the leftmost column index (`object_min_col`) and rightmost column index (`object_max_col`) occupied by the current red object.\n    d.  Calculate the distance to the left boundary: `dist_left = object_min_col - region_min_col`.\n    e.  Calculate the distance to the right boundary: `dist_right = region_max_col - object_max_col`.\n    f.  Compare the distances:\n        i.  If `dist_left <= dist_right`, the object needs to move left. The horizontal shift amount is `-dist_left`.\n        ii. If `dist_right < dist_left`, the object needs to move right. The horizontal shift amount is `+dist_right`.\n    g.  For every pixel belonging to the current red object at `(row, col)` in the input grid:\n        i.  Set the pixel at `(row, col)` in the *output* grid back to the determined background color.\n    h.  For every pixel belonging to the current red object at `(row, col)` in the input grid:\n        i.  Calculate the new column: `new_col = col + shift_amount`.\n        ii. Set the pixel at `(row, new_col)` in the *output* grid to red (color 2).\n4.  Return the final modified output grid."
