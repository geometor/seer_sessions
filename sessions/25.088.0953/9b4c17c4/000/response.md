Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure & Colors:** The input grids contain distinct regions defined by background colors, primarily blue (1) and azure (8). Within these regions, there are objects composed of red (2) pixels.
2.  **Objects:** The red objects are typically rectangular shapes of varying sizes, sometimes just single pixels. They exist entirely within one of the background-colored regions.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the red objects horizontally within their respective background regions. The background regions themselves remain static.
4.  **Movement Logic:** The direction and distance of movement seem determined by the object's proximity to the horizontal boundaries of its containing region. Objects slide towards the *nearest* vertical edge (either the grid's edge or the boundary between different background regions) until they touch that edge. They do not move vertically.
5.  **Consistency:** This "slide to nearest edge" rule appears consistent across all four training examples, regardless of whether the regions are arranged top-bottom or left-right.

**Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - role: background
    colors: [1, 8] # blue, azure
    properties:
      - forms contiguous regions
      - static (do not move or change color)
  - role: object
    colors: [2] # red
    properties:
      - contiguous shapes (often rectangles)
      - exist within a single background region
      - mobile
actions:
  - name: horizontal_slide
    target: object (red pixels)
    constraints:
      - movement is purely horizontal
      - occurs within the boundaries of the object's background region
    trigger:
      - proximity to vertical boundaries of the region
    rule:
      - calculate distance from object's left edge to region's left boundary
      - calculate distance from object's right edge to region's right boundary
      - move object towards the closer boundary
      - stop when any part of the object touches the boundary
relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: object (red pixels)
    object: background region
    description: Each red object is fully contained within a region defined by a single background color (blue or azure).
  - type: boundary
    subject: background region
    object: grid edges or other background regions
    description: Background regions have vertical boundaries defined by the grid edges or transitions to regions of a different background color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Identify all distinct, contiguous objects composed of red (color 2) pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each identified red object:
    a.  Determine the background color (blue (1) or azure (8)) of the region immediately surrounding the object.
    b.  Identify the full extent of this contiguous background region. Determine its leftmost column index (`region_min_col`) and rightmost column index (`region_max_col`).
    c.  Determine the leftmost column index (`object_min_col`) and rightmost column index (`object_max_col`) occupied by the current red object.
    d.  Calculate the distance to the left boundary: `dist_left = object_min_col - region_min_col`.
    e.  Calculate the distance to the right boundary: `dist_right = region_max_col - object_max_col`.
    f.  Compare the distances:
        i.  If `dist_left <= dist_right`, the object needs to move left. The horizontal shift amount is `-dist_left`.
        ii. If `dist_right < dist_left`, the object needs to move right. The horizontal shift amount is `+dist_right`.
    g.  For every pixel belonging to the current red object at `(row, col)` in the input grid:
        i.  Set the pixel at `(row, col)` in the *output* grid back to the determined background color.
    h.  For every pixel belonging to the current red object at `(row, col)` in the input grid:
        i.  Calculate the new column: `new_col = col + shift_amount`.
        ii. Set the pixel at `(row, new_col)` in the *output* grid to red (color 2).
4.  Return the final modified output grid.
