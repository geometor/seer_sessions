"""
Identifies a unique horizontal bar of four gray pixels ('5 5 5 5'). 
Based on the value 'V' of the pixel immediately to the right of this bar, 
it calculates the placement (start column and two row indices) for two new 
horizontal bars of five gray pixels ('5 5 5 5 5'). 
The output grid is a copy of the input grid with these two new gray bars added.

1. Find the unique horizontal sequence '5 5 5 5'. Let its start be (R, C).
2. Get the value 'V' of the pixel at (R, C+4).
3. Calculate the start column for the new bars: start_col = (C + 4) + floor(V / 2) - 2.
4. Determine the first row 'row1' based on V:
   - If V=4, row1 = R + 1.
   - If V=6, row1 = R + 5.
   - If V=8, row1 = R + 4.
5. Determine the second row 'row2' = row1 + 4.
6. Draw two gray bars of length 5 ('5 5 5 5 5') starting at (row1, start_col) and (row2, start_col).
