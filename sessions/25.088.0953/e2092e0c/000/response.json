            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Size:** All input and output grids are 15x15.\n2.  **Background:** The primary background color is white (0).\n3.  **Key Object:** In each input grid, there is exactly one prominent horizontal bar composed of four gray (5) pixels (`5 5 5 5`). In all training examples, this bar is located at row index 3, column indices 0 through 3.\n4.  **Trigger Pixel:** Immediately to the right of this gray bar (at row 3, column 4), there is a single non-white pixel. The color/value of this pixel varies between examples (yellow/4, magenta/6, azure/8).\n5.  **Output Changes:** The output grid is identical to the input grid except for the addition of two new horizontal gray bars.\n6.  **New Objects:** Two new horizontal bars, each composed of five gray (5) pixels (`5 5 5 5 5`), are added to the grid. The original four-pixel gray bar remains unchanged.\n7.  **Placement Pattern:**\n    *   The two new five-pixel gray bars are always placed horizontally.\n    *   Within a single example, both new bars start at the same column index. This starting column index varies between examples (4, 5, 6).\n    *   The two new bars are placed on different rows. The row indices vary between examples (rows 4&8, 8&12, 7&11).\n    *   The vertical distance between the two new bars is always 4 rows. (e.g., 8-4=4, 12-8=4, 11-7=4).\n8.  **Relationship:** The position (rows and starting column) of the two new gray bars seems determined by the properties (location and color/value) of the original four-pixel gray bar and the pixel immediately to its right.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
