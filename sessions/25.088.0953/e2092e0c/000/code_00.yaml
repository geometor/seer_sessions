task_description: Adds two horizontal gray bars based on an existing shorter gray bar and its right neighbor.

elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - size: 15x15 (constant across examples)
      - background_color: white (0)

  - element: source_object
    description: The trigger object in the input grid.
    properties:
      - shape: horizontal bar
      - color: gray (5)
      - length: 4 pixels
      - composition: sequence `5 5 5 5`
      - quantity: exactly one per input grid
      - location: (row R, col C) to (R, C+3). Observed at R=3, C=0 in examples.
      - persistence: remains unchanged in the output.

  - element: trigger_pixel
    description: The pixel influencing the placement of new objects.
    properties:
      - location: adjacent to the right end of the source_object, at (R, C+4). Observed at (3, 4).
      - value: V (variable, observed values 4, 6, 8). Determines placement rules.

  - element: generated_objects
    description: The objects added to create the output grid.
    properties:
      - quantity: 2
      - shape: horizontal bar
      - color: gray (5)
      - length: 5 pixels
      - composition: sequence `5 5 5 5 5`
      - placement: Determined by source_object location (R, C) and trigger_pixel value V.
        - Both start at `start_col = (C+4) + floor(V / 2) - 2`.
        - Located at rows `row1` and `row2`, where `row2 = row1 + 4`.
        - `row1` depends on V:
          - If V=4, `row1 = R + 1`.
          - If V=6, `row1 = R + 5`.
          - If V=8, `row1 = R + 4`.

relationships:
  - type: dependency
    from: generated_objects placement (start_col, row1, row2)
    to: source_object location (R, C) and trigger_pixel value (V)
  - type: spatial
    description: trigger_pixel is immediately right of source_object.
  - type: spatial
    description: generated_objects are placed below the source_object row.
  - type: spatial
    description: The two generated_objects are vertically separated by 4 rows and horizontally aligned (same start/end columns).

actions:
  - action: find
    target: horizontal bar `5 5 5 5` (source_object)
  - action: identify
    target: pixel to the right of source_object (trigger_pixel)
  - action: calculate
    inputs: source_object location (R, C), trigger_pixel value (V)
    outputs: placement parameters (start_col, row1, row2) for generated_objects
  - action: copy
    source: input grid
    target: output grid
  - action: draw
    target: two `5 5 5 5 5` bars at calculated positions on the output grid
