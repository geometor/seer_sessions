## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code failed because it made several incorrect assumptions based solely on the first example:
1.  It assumed only one sequence pattern exists in the last row, starting from the first non-white pixel. Examples 2 and 3 show multiple sequences can exist.
2.  It assumed the sequence is always placed immediately to the *right* of *any* non-white trigger pixel.
3.  It didn't recognize the mapping mechanism where the *color* of the trigger pixel determines *which* sequence from the last row should be used.
4.  It didn't implement the correct placement logic, which involves aligning the sequence based on the position of the trigger color within its sequence and potentially overwriting the original trigger pixel.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Identify Sequences:** Implement logic to find *all* distinct contiguous non-white sequences in the last row. Store each sequence and the set of colors it contains.
2.  **Identify Triggers:** Locate all non-white pixels in the grid *above* the last row.
3.  **Map Triggers to Sequences:** For each trigger pixel `(r, c)` with color `C`:
    *   Determine which sequence `S` from the last row contains color `C`.
    *   Find the index `idx` of the *first occurrence* of color `C` within sequence `S`.
4.  **Calculate Placement:** Determine the starting column `start_col = c - idx`.
5.  **Generate Output:** Create a copy of the input grid. For each trigger, write the corresponding sequence `S` onto the trigger's row `r`, starting at `start_col`, respecting grid boundaries (clipping) and overwriting existing pixels (including the trigger pixel itself). The last row of the grid remains unchanged in the final output.
