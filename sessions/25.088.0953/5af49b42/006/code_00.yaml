Input_Grid:
  Type: 2D array of integers (0-9 representing colors)
  Properties:
    - Height: Variable (1-30)
    - Width: Variable (1-30)
    - Last_Row: The final row of the grid.
    - Pixels_Above_Last_Row: All pixels in rows from 0 to Height-2.

Objects:
  - Name: Sequence
    Definition: A contiguous horizontal block of one or more non-white pixels located in the Last_Row.
    Properties:
      - Content: An ordered list of color values (integers 1-9).
      - Location: Defined by the start and end column index within the Last_Row.
      - Order: Sequences are identified from left to right within the Last_Row.
  - Name: Trigger_Pixel
    Definition: A single non-white pixel located in any row *above* the Last_Row.
    Properties:
      - Color: The integer value (1-9) of the pixel.
      - Location: Defined by its row and column index.

Relationships:
  - Mapping: Each unique color value present in any Sequence is mapped to two things:
      1. The *first* Sequence (ordered left-to-right) in which that color appears.
      2. The index (position, starting from 0) of that color's first occurrence within that specific Sequence.
    Example: If Last_Row has sequences S1=[1,2,1] and S2=[3,2], the map is {1:(S1,0), 2:(S1,1), 3:(S2,0)}. Color 1 maps to index 0 of S1; Color 2 maps to index 1 of S1 (its first appearance overall).

Actions:
  - Identify_Sequences: Scan the Last_Row from left to right to find all Sequences.
  - Build_Map: Create the Mapping based on the identified Sequences and the colors within them.
  - Identify_Triggers: Scan all Pixels_Above_Last_Row to find all Trigger_Pixels.
  - Transform:
    - For each Trigger_Pixel identified:
      - Look up its Color in the Mapping.
      - If the Color exists in the map:
        - Retrieve the associated Sequence (Content) and the color's index (Index_in_Sequence) from the Mapping.
        - Determine the target start column for pasting: `Paste_Start_Col = Trigger_Pixel.Location.Column - Index_in_Sequence`.
        - Paste the retrieved Sequence Content onto the Trigger_Pixel's row in the output grid, starting at Paste_Start_Col.
        - Pasting overwrites any existing pixels in that row segment.
        - If the paste extends beyond the grid boundaries (left or right), clip the sequence to fit within the grid width.
    - Copy the original Last_Row to the output grid's last row without modification.
    - All other pixels (white pixels above the last row, and any pixels not overwritten by pasting) retain their original color from the input grid.

Output_Grid:
  - A 2D array of the same dimensions as the Input_Grid, resulting from the Transform actions.
