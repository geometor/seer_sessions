"""
Transforms an input grid based on patterns found in its last row.

1. Analyzes the last row of the input grid to find all contiguous horizontal sequences of non-white pixels.
2. Creates a mapping from each unique non-white color found in these sequences to the first sequence it appears in (from left to right) and its index within that sequence.
3. Identifies all non-white 'trigger' pixels in the grid rows above the last row.
4. For each trigger pixel, retrieves the associated sequence and index from the map using the trigger's color.
5. Copies the retrieved sequence onto the trigger pixel's row in the output grid. The sequence is aligned such that the trigger pixel's original column corresponds to its color's position within the sequence.
6. The pasting overwrites existing pixels in the row. If sequences extend beyond grid boundaries, they are clipped.
7. The last row of the grid remains unchanged in the output.
