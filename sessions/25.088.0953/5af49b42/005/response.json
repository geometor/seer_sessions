Analyzes the last row of the input grid to find all contiguous horizontal sequences of non-white pixels.\n2. Creates a mapping from each unique non-white color found in these sequences to the first sequence it appears in (from left to right) and its index within that sequence.\n3. Identifies all non-white 'trigger' pixels in the grid rows above the last row.\n4. For each trigger pixel, retrieves the associated sequence and index from the map using the trigger's color.\n5. Copies the retrieved sequence onto the trigger pixel's row in the output grid. The sequence is aligned such that the trigger pixel's original column corresponds to its color's position within the sequence.\n6. The pasting overwrites existing pixels in the row. If sequences extend beyond grid boundaries, they are clipped.\n7. The last row of the grid remains unchanged in the output.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_sequences_and_mapping(grid: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[List[List[int]], Dict[int, Tuple[List[int], int]]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous sequences of non-white colors in the last row\n    and creates a mapping from each color within those sequences to the\n    sequence itself and the color's first index within that sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing:\n        - A list of all sequences found (each sequence is a list of ints).\n        - A dictionary mapping each color found in the sequences to a tuple:\n          (the sequence containing the color, the first index of the color in that sequence).\n          If a color appears in multiple sequences, it maps to the first sequence it appears in.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequences = []\n    color_to_sequence_map = {}\n    last_row = grid[-1, :]\n    width = grid.shape[1]\n    \n    current_sequence = []\n    in_sequence = False\n    \n    # Scan the last row to identify sequences\n    for c, color in enumerate(last_row):\n        if color != 0: # Non-white pixel (value 0 is white)\n            if not in_sequence:\n                # Start of a new sequence\n                in_sequence = True\n                current_sequence = [color]\n            else:\n                # Continue existing sequence\n                current_sequence.append(color)\n        else: # White pixel\n            if in_sequence:\n                # End of the current sequence\n                in_sequence = False\n                if current_sequence:\n                    sequences.append(current_sequence)\n                    # Update mapping for colors in this sequence\n                    # Only map a color the *first* time it's seen in a sequence\n                    for idx, seq_color in enumerate(current_sequence):\n                        if seq_color not in color_to_sequence_map:\n                             color_to_sequence_map[seq_color] = (current_sequence, idx)\n                    current_sequence = [] # Reset for next potential sequence\n\n    # Handle sequence ending at the right edge of the grid\n    if in_sequence and current_sequence:\n        sequences.append(current_sequence)\n        # Update mapping for colors in this sequence\n        for idx, seq_color in enumerate(current_sequence):\n            if seq_color not in color_to_sequence_map:\n                 color_to_sequence_map[seq_color] = (current_sequence, idx)\n\n    return sequences, color_to_sequence_map\n\ndef find_triggers(grid: np.ndarray) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all non-white pixels (triggers) in the grid, excluding the last row.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of tuples, where each tuple contains (row, column, color)\n        for a trigger pixel.\n    \"\"\"\n    triggers = []\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    # Iterate through rows, excluding the last one (index height - 1)\n    for r in range(height - 1):\n        for c in range(width):\n            color = grid[r, c]\n            if color != 0: # Non-white pixel\n                triggers.append((r, c, color))\n    return triggers\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to a numpy array for efficient processing\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input\n    output_array = np.copy(input_array)\n    height, width = input_array.shape\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze Last Row - Find sequences and build the color map\n    sequences, color_map = find_sequences_and_mapping(input_array)\n\n    # If no sequences are found in the last row, or the map is empty (no non-white colors in sequences),\n    # then no transformation can occur based on the rules.
