"""
Transforms an input grid based on patterns found in its last row and trigger pixels above it.

1. Analyzes the last row of the input grid to find all contiguous horizontal sequences of non-white pixels.
2. Creates a mapping from each unique non-white color found in these sequences to the first sequence it appears in (from left to right) and its index (first occurrence) within that sequence.
3. Identifies all non-white 'trigger' pixels in the grid rows above the last row.
4. Initializes an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
5. For each trigger pixel:
    a. Looks up the trigger pixel's color in the mapping.
    b. If found, retrieves the associated sequence and the color's index within that sequence.
    c. Calculates the starting column to paste the sequence in the trigger's row, aligning the sequence based on the trigger's column and the color's index within the sequence.
    d. Pastes the retrieved sequence onto the trigger pixel's row in the output grid, overwriting existing pixels. Pasting is clipped to the grid boundaries.
6. The last row of the grid remains unchanged in the output.
7. Returns the modified output grid.
