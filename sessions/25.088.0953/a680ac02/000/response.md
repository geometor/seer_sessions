*   **Perception:** The input grids contain multiple geometric shapes (objects) of various colors scattered on a white background. The objects relevant to the transformation appear to be 4x4 "hollow squares" or "frames" - that is, a 4x4 square where the border is a single color and the inner 2x2 area is white (color 0). Other objects, such as solid squares of the same or different sizes, are ignored. The task involves identifying these hollow squares, determining their relative positions in the input grid, and then arranging them contiguously in the output grid. The final arrangement (horizontal or vertical stacking) and the order of the shapes depend on their initial positions and potentially the number of shapes found.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct 4x4 subgrids that match the pattern of a "hollow square": a square with a 1-pixel thick border of a single non-white color and a 2x2 center filled with white (0). Record the color and the top-left row/column coordinates of each identified hollow square.
    2.  Determine the arrangement direction for the output grid:
        a.  If exactly two hollow squares were identified: Compare their top-left coordinates. Let the square with the smaller row index (or smaller column index if rows are equal) be `square1` and the other be `square2`. If the row index of `square2` is greater than the row index of `square1` plus 3 (i.e., `square2` starts on a row completely below `square1`), set the arrangement direction to 'Vertical'. Otherwise, set the arrangement direction to 'Horizontal'.
        b.  If the number of identified hollow squares is not two (i.e., zero, one, three, or more), set the arrangement direction to 'Horizontal'.
    3.  Sort the identified hollow squares based on the arrangement direction:
        a.  If the arrangement direction is 'Horizontal', sort the squares primarily by their column coordinate (ascending) and secondarily by their row coordinate (ascending).
        b.  If the arrangement direction is 'Vertical', sort the squares primarily by their row coordinate (ascending) and secondarily by their column coordinate (ascending).
    4.  Construct the output grid:
        a.  If the arrangement direction is 'Horizontal', create a new grid with height 4 and width equal to 4 times the number of identified squares. Place the sorted squares side-by-side horizontally in the determined order.
        b.  If the arrangement direction is 'Vertical', create a new grid with width 4 and height equal to 4 times the number of identified squares. Place the sorted squares stacked vertically in the determined order.
    5.  Return the constructed grid as the output.
