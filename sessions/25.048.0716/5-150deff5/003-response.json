A border cell is defined as a cell of color 5 that is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a cell *not* of color 5. Change these border cells to color 8 (azure).\n\n3.  **Fill Inner Cells:** Fill all the other cells (inner cells) of the original color 5 area that are *not* part of the border, but are not adjacent to color 0, with color 2 (red).\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\nThe transformation extracts the object formed by color 5. The border of the object is turned into color 8, while the other cells of the object that are not adjacent to color 0 are filled with color 2.\n\nThe Python code provided in the first round accurately captures this rule and correctly transforms the example input. It works by identifying all cells with color 5, determines which are border/outline cells by checking for neighbors not colored 5. The color is changed for these outline cells. The inner cells get a different color.\n"
