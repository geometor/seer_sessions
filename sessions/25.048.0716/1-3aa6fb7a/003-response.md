Okay, let's analyze the second example of the transformation.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
      shape: "Scattered azure colored shapes, some single cells, and some 2x1 or 1x2."
  dimensions: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
      shape: "Same as input."
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
      shape: "Three 1x1 blue colored dots."
  dimensions: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains multiple azure (color 8) objects, some single cells, and some appearing as 2x1 or 1x2 blocks.

2.  **Detect Changes**: Similar to the first example, Blue dots are added to the output.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**

    *   Copy all azure (color 8) objects from the input grid to the output grid.
    *   Identify white cells (color 0) directly to the right or below the single-cell azure blocks that aren't part of a bigger shape. Transform the identified white cells to the color blue (color 1)

**Elaboration of the transformation rule:**

The transformation rule observed in the first example holds. Azure objects are copied, and blue cells are placed adjacent to single azure blocks that are not parts of a 2x1 or a 1x2 block. The code already developed explains correctly how to go from input to output.
