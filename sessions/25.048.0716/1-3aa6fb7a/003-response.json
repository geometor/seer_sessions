Transform the identified white cells to the color blue (color 1)\n\n**Elaboration of the transformation rule:**\n\nThe transformation rule observed in the first example holds. Azure objects are copied, and blue cells are placed adjacent to single azure blocks that are not parts of a 2x1 or a 1x2 block. The code already developed explains correctly how to go from input to output.\n"
