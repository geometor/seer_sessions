Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml

  size: 9x9
  objects:
    red_object:
      color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: 1x1

      position: (6, 6)
      shape: 1x1
    background:
      color: 0 (white)

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** In the input grid, we have a single red pixel (object) at coordinates (3, 2) and a single blue pixel (object) at (6, 6). The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels (background, color 0).

2.  **Yellow Cross:** A yellow "cross" shape (color 4) appears, centered around the red pixel. Specifically, yellow pixels are placed one position above, one position below the red pixel.

3.  **Orange Cross:** An orange "cross" shape (color 7) appears, centered on the blue pixel. Specifically, orange pixels are placed one position to the left, right, above, and below the blue pixel.

4.  **Preservation:** The original red and blue pixels are preserved at their original locations.

**Natural language program summary**
A yellow cross centered on the red pixel and an orange cross centered on the blue pixel is added to the grid. The red and blue pixel are preserved.

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid has:
    *   An azure pixel at (0, 3).
    *   Two red pixels at (2, 6) and (7, 1).
    *   Two blue pixels at (3, 2) and (6, 6).

2.  **Yellow Crosses:** A yellow "cross" shape (color 4) appears centered around *each* of the red pixels. The yellow pixels are placed above and below the red pixel.

3.  **Orange Crosses:** An orange "cross" (color 7) is created around *each* of the blue pixels. Orange pixels are placed to the left, right, above and below of the blue pixel.

4.  **Preservation:** The original red, blue, and azure pixels remain at their original locations.

**Natural Language Program Summary:**

The rule from the previous example is applied to all instances of colors 1 and 2. Yellow crosses are added, centered on each red pixel, and orange crosses are centered on each blue pixel. All original red, blue, and azure pixels are kept. The azure object doesn't interact.

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid has:
    *   A red pixel at (2, 2).
    *   A blue pixel at (7, 3).
    *  A magenta pixel at (5,6)

2.  **Yellow Cross:** A yellow "cross" shape (color 4) appears centered around the red pixel. The yellow pixels are placed above, and below the red pixel.

3.  **Orange Cross:** An orange "cross" (color 7) is created around the blue pixel. Orange pixels are placed to the left, right, above and below of the blue pixel.

4. **Magenta Object:** The magenta object remains.

5.  **Preservation:** The original red, blue, and magenta pixels remain at their original locations.

**Natural Language Program Summary:**

The final program considers only pixels with color 1 and 2, ignoring any other pixel.
Yellow crosses are added, centered on each red pixel, and orange crosses are centered on each blue pixel. All original red, blue, and magenta pixels are kept. The magenta object doesn't interact.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
