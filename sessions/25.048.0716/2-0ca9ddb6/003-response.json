The yellow pixels are placed above and below the red pixel.\n\n3.  **Orange Crosses:** An orange \"cross\" (color 7) is created around *each* of the blue pixels. Orange pixels are placed to the left, right, above and below of the blue pixel.\n\n4.  **Preservation:** The original red, blue, and azure pixels remain at their original locations.\n\n**Natural Language Program Summary:**\n\nThe rule from the previous example is applied to all instances of colors 1 and 2. Yellow crosses are added, centered on each red pixel, and orange crosses are centered on each blue pixel. All original red, blue, and azure pixels are kept. The azure object doesn't interact.\n"
