Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Documentation**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors:
      3:  # Green
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]
      1:  # Blue
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]
      2:  # Red
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)]
  output_grid:
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors:
      4:  # Yellow
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]
      5:  # Gray
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]
      6:  # Magenta
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)]

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Object Identification**: The input grid consists of three columns, each filled with a single color. There exist three objects in the input. The first one comprises all cells of color 3 (green). The second object comprises cells of color 1 (blue), and the last object comprises cells of color 2 (red).

2.  **Color Mapping**:
    *   The green color (3) in the input is transformed to yellow (4) in the output.
    *   The blue color (1) in the input is transformed to gray (5) in the output.
    *   The red color (2) in the input is transformed to magenta (6) in the output.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    - Identify objects and their colors.
    - Transform each color in the object, changing 3 to 4, 1 to 5, and 2 to 6.
    - Output has the same shape and size than the input.

In essence, the transformation is a simple color substitution based on the given mapping, maintaining the grid's structure.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
