Okay, let's analyze this third transformation.

**YAML Documentation**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors:
      5:  # Gray
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]
      8:  # Azure
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]
      6:  # Magenta
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)]
  output_grid:
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors:
      1:  # Blue
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]
      9:  # Maroon
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]
      2:  # Red
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Object Identification**: Similar to the previous examples, the input grid has three columns, each a distinct object of a single color: Gray (5), Azure (8), and Magenta (6).

2.  **Color Mapping**: This transformation uses a different mapping:
    *   Gray (5) becomes Blue (1).
    *   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9).
    *   Magenta (6) becomes Red (2).

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   Identify the three color objects.
    *   Apply the color transformation: 5 -> 1, 8 -> 9, and 6 -> 2.
    *   Preserve the grid structure.

The core concept remains color substitution, but with a new mapping.  The spatial arrangement and object definition are consistent with the prior examples.
