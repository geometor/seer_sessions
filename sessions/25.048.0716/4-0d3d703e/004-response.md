```python
"""
The transformation rule is a color substitution based on a consistent mapping,
independent of the object's position or shape within the grid. The mapping is:

- 3 (Green) -> 4 (Yellow)
- 1 (Blue)  -> 5 (Gray)
- 2 (Red)   -> 6 (Magenta)
- 8 (Azure) -> 9 (Maroon)

The grid structure (dimensions and object shapes) is preserved. The
transformation acts uniformly on all cells of a given color.

This can be combined in these two rules
- If Green, Blue, or Red, increase its value by one.
- Other colors remain unchanged (First example).
    - If Red, Green, or Azure, increase its value by one considering that
    - Red becomes Magenta and Azure becomes Maroon.
