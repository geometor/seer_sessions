**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Object Identification**: The input grid consists of three columns, each filled with a single color. There exist three objects in the input. The first one comprises all cells of color 3 (green). The second object comprises cells of color 1 (blue), and the last object comprises cells of color 2 (red).

2.  **Color Mapping**:
    *   The green color (3) in the input is transformed to yellow (4) in the output.
    *   The blue color (1) in the input is transformed to gray (5) in the output.
    *   The red color (2) in the input is transformed to magenta (6) in the output.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    - Identify objects and their colors.
    - Transform each color in the object, changing 3 to 4, 1 to 5, and 2 to 6.
    - Output has the same shape and size than the input.

In essence, the transformation is a simple color substitution based on the given mapping, maintaining the grid's structure.

The grid structure (dimensions and object shapes) is preserved. The
transformation acts uniformly on all cells of a given color.

This can be combined in these two rules
- If Green, Blue, or Red, increase its value by one.
- Other colors remain unchanged (First example).
    - If Red, Green, or Azure, increase its value by one considering that
    - Red becomes Magenta and Azure becomes Maroon.

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Object Identification**: Similar to the previous examples, the input grid has three columns, each a distinct object of a single color: Gray (5), Azure (8), and Magenta (6).

2.  **Color Mapping**: This transformation uses a different mapping:
    *   Gray (5) becomes Blue (1).
    *   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9).
    *   Magenta (6) becomes Red (2).

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   Identify the three color objects.
    *   Apply the color transformation: 5 -> 1, 8 -> 9, and 6 -> 2.
    *   Preserve the grid structure.

The core concept remains color substitution, but with a new mapping.  The spatial arrangement and object definition are consistent with the prior examples.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
