Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 6x6
  objects:
    yellow_squares:
      count: 3
      positions: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (5,0)]
    orange_squares:
      count: 2
      positions: [(4,2), (5,2)]
    azure_squares:
      count: 2
      positions: [ (1,3), (4,3)]
    maroon_square:
      count: 1
      position: [(0, 5)]
    white_squares:
      count: 28
      positions: Other cells

output_grid:
  size: 6x6
  objects:
    yellow_squares:
      count: 3
      positions: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (5,0)]
    orange_squares:
      count: 2
      positions: [(4,2), (5,2)]
    azure_squares:
      count: 2
      positions: [(4,3), (5,3)]
    maroon_square:
      count: 1
      position: [(5, 5)]
    white_squares:
     count: 28
     positions: Other cells
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify non-white objects:** Locate all colored squares in the input grid.

2.  **Move Objects to the Bottom Row if the row index is less than the number of rows -1**: For each colored object, its new coordinates are calculated as (rows-1, x\_input) if the row index is less than the number of rows-1. This moves the object at row *x*, column *y* in the input to row 5, column *y* in the output if x < number of rows -1. Otherwise colored cells are note moved.

3.  **Clear the original positions**: All other cells that are not updated in the output are turned to white (0).

**Summary of the transformation rule**

The transformation rule involves taking non-white cells on the input grid and moving them to the last row of the output grid if the row index is less than number of rows-1, keeping their original column position. Otherwise the coloured cells remain in place. All other cells turn white.
