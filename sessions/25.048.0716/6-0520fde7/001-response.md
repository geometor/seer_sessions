Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [3, 7]
  objects:
    blue_objects:
      count: 4
      positions: [[0,0], [1,1], [1,5], [1,6], [2,0]]
    grey_objects:
      count: 3
      positions: [[0,3], [1,3], [2,3]]
    white_objects:
      count: 10
      positions: Remaining cells
output_grid:
  dimensions: [3, 3]
  objects:
    red_object:
      count: 1
      position: [1, 1]
    white_objects:
      count: 8
      positions: Remaining cells
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify the Core:** The output grid is a 3x3 square. This suggests we're focusing on a 3x3 region within the input grid.

2.  **Locate the Reference:** Locate the gray object (color 5) in the middle row (row index 1) of input grid.

3. **Define the boundary:** Using the location of this gray object as the central point to create a new 3x3 output grid.

4.  **Change the central color:** Transform the color of central point to red (color 2).

5.  **Blank other cells:** Change all surrounding cells within the 3x3 boundary to white (color 0).
