"""
1. Identify Azure Objects: Locate all contiguous blocks (objects) of azure (color 8) pixels within the input grid.
2. Object Categorization: For the set of azure object, classify by shape. Specifically look for 1x2 azure objects.
3. Find the split target: Of the 1x2 azure objects, identify the one that is the most lower-right within the image.
   It can be described as having the largest row index, and within any ties, having the largest column index.
4. Preserve and split: All azure colored objects are preserved except for the split target. The split target
   object is separated into two individual 1x1 objects.
5. Recolor split pixels: The two pixels of the object are recolored. The first pixel (most to the left) of the
   original lower-rightmost object is changed to blue (color 1). The second pixel is kept as its original color,
   azure (color 8).
6. Background Preservation: All other pixels in the grid that are not part of the identified azure objects remain
   unchanged (implicitly, they are color 0, white).

Okay, here's an analysis of the transformation, focusing on objects, properties, and actions, and building a natural language program description:

**Observations and Context**

1.  **Object of Interest:** The primary objects involved in the transformation are contiguous blocks of azure (color 8) pixels.

2.  **Shape Matters:** Within the azure objects, the shape 1x2 (horizontal domino) is significant.

3.  **Positional Importance:**  The *lower-rightmost* 1x2 azure object is the target of the transformation. "Lower-rightmost" is determined by prioritizing the row index (lower = larger row index) and then the column index (rightmost = larger column index).

4.  **Transformation Action:** The transformation involves splitting the target 1x2 azure object into two 1x1 azure objects.

5. **Color Change** The left pixel of the target object changes to blue (color 1) and the other stays azure.

6.  **Preservation:** All other azure objects *not* meeting the "lower-rightmost 1x2" criteria are preserved unchanged. All non-azure pixels also stay the same.

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step natural language program describing the transformation:

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Find all contiguous groups of azure (color 8) pixels. These are our initial objects.

2.  **Filter by Shape:** From these azure objects, select only those with a 1x2 shape (1 row, 2 columns).

3.  **Find the Target:** Among the 1x2 azure objects, locate the one that is the *lower-rightmost*. This is done by:
    *   Comparing row indices (higher index is lower).
    *   If row indices are equal, compare column indices (higher index is more to the right).

4.  **Split and Recolor:** Split the lower-rightmost 1x2 object into two individual pixels. The left pixel of the now separated pair is recolored blue (color 1) and the right one remains color 8.

5.  **Preserve the Rest:** All other azure objects (those that are not 1x2, or are 1x2 but not the lower-rightmost) are kept as they are in the input.  All other non-azure pixels are implicitly color 0 (white).

**Summary of Errors in Previous Code**
The program was correctly described, and the code was close to correct. The issue occurs within the "Split and Recolor" step. The original code does not account for preserving the input, only copying azure objects and operating on the target.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
