Object Categorization: For the set of azure object, classify by shape. Specifically look for 1x2 azure objects.\n3. Find the split target: Of the 1x2 azure objects, identify the one that is the most lower-right within the image.\n   It can be described as having the largest row index, and within any ties, having the largest column index.\n4. Preserve and split: All azure colored objects are preserved except for the split target. The split target\n   object is separated into two individual 1x1 objects.\n5. Recolor split pixels: The two pixels of the object are recolored. The first pixel (most to the left) of the\n   original lower-rightmost object is changed to blue (color 1). The second pixel is kept as its original color,\n   azure (color 8).\n6. Background Preservation: All other pixels in the grid that are not part of the identified azure objects remain\n   unchanged (implicitly, they are color 0, white).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous blocks (objects) of a specified color in the grid.\n    Returns a list of bounding box coordinates, each as (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    def dfs(row, col, current_object):\n        \"\"\"Depth-First Search helper to find contiguous pixels.\"\"\"\n        if (row < 0 or row >= grid.shape[0] or col < 0 or col >= grid.shape[1] or\n                visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != color):\n            return\n\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        current_object.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, current_object)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, current_object)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, current_object)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, current_object)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[row, col] == color and not visited[row, col]:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(row, col, current_object)\n                if current_object:\n                    min_row, min_col = np.min(current_object, axis=0)\n                    max_row, max_col = np.max(current_object, axis=0)\n                    objects.append((min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col))\n\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    azure_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 8)\n\n    # Find the lower-rightmost 1x2 azure object\n    lower_right_object = None\n    for obj in azure_objects:\n        min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col = obj\n        if max_row - min_row == 0 and max_col - min_col == 1:  # Check for 1x2 shape\n            if lower_right_object is None:\n                lower_right_object = obj\n            else:  # Find the most lower-right object\n                if min_row > lower_right_object[0]:\n                    lower_right_object = obj\n                elif min_row == lower_right_object[0] and min_col > lower_right_object[1]:\n                    lower_right_object = obj\n\n    # Copy all objects except the lower-rightmost 1x2 object\n    for obj in azure_objects:\n        if obj != lower_right_object:\n            min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col = obj\n            for r in range(min_row, max_row + 1):\n                for c in range(min_col, max_col + 1):\n                    output_grid[r, c] = input_grid[r,c]\n\n    # Split and change the object\n    if lower_right_object is not None:\n        min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col = lower_right_object\n        output_grid[min_row, min_col] = 1  # Change first pixel to blue\n        output_grid[max_row, max_col] = 8  # Keep second pixel azure\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
