All non-azure pixels also stay the same.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nHere's a step-by-step natural language program describing the transformation:\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Find all contiguous groups of azure (color 8) pixels. These are our initial objects.\n\n2.  **Filter by Shape:** From these azure objects, select only those with a 1x2 shape (1 row, 2 columns).\n\n3.  **Find the Target:** Among the 1x2 azure objects, locate the one that is the *lower-rightmost*. This is done by:\n    *   Comparing row indices (higher index is lower).\n    *   If row indices are equal, compare column indices (higher index is more to the right).\n\n4.  **Split and Recolor:** Split the lower-rightmost 1x2 object into two individual pixels. The left pixel of the now separated pair is recolored blue (color 1) and the right one remains color 8.\n\n5.  **Preserve the Rest:** All other azure objects (those that are not 1x2, or are 1x2 but not the lower-rightmost) are kept as they are in the input.  All other non-azure pixels are implicitly color 0 (white).\n\n**Summary of Errors in Previous Code**\nThe program was correctly described, and the code was close to correct. The issue occurs within the \"Split and Recolor\" step. The original code does not account for preserving the input, only copying azure objects and operating on the target.\n"
