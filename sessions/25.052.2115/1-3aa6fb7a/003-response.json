            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and refine the natural language program description. The previous code and description have some inaccuracies, as evidenced by the failed test cases.\n\nHere's a revised breakdown of the transformation, focusing on object properties and actions:\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks (objects) of azure (color 8) pixels within the input grid.\n\n2.  **Object Categorization** For the set of azure object, classify by shape. Specifically look for 1x2 azure objects.\n\n3.  **Find the split target**. Of the 1x2 azure objects, identify the one that is the most lower-right within the image. It can be describe as having the largest row index, and within any ties, having the largest column index.\n\n4. **Preserve and split** All azure colored objects are preserved except for the split target. The split target object, is separated into two individual 1x1 objects.\n\n5.  **Recolor split pixels**. The two pixels of the object are recolored. The first pixel (most to the left) of the original lower-rightmost object is changed to blue (color 1). The second pixel is kept as its original color, azure (color 8).\n\n6.  **Background Preservation:** All other pixels in the grid that are not part of the identified azure objects remain unchanged (implicitly, they are color 0, white).\n\n**Key Improvements and Clarifications:**\n\n*   **Focus on Lower-Rightmost *1x2* Object:** The previous description missed the crucial detail that it has to have 1x2 shape, and not, say, a 2x2. The program explicitly states this shape constraint.\n*   **Precise Splitting and Recoloring:** The updated description clarifies that the lower-rightmost 1x2 object is split, and *how* the recoloring occurs (first pixel becomes blue).\n*   **Object properties matter**: shape and position\n\nThis refined natural language program provides a more accurate and complete description of the transformation rule, ready to be implemented in the coding phase.\n"
