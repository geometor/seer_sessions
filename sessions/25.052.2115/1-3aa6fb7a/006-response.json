Filter by Shape: From these azure objects, select only those with a 1x2 shape (1 row, 2 columns).\n3. Find the Target: Among the 1x2 azure objects, locate the one that is the *lower-rightmost*.\n   - Compare row indices (higher index is lower).\n   - If row indices are equal, compare column indices (higher index is more to the right).\n4. Split and Recolor: Split the lower-rightmost 1x2 object into two individual pixels. The left pixel is recolored blue (color 1) and the right pixel is kept azure (color 8).\n5. Preserve the Rest: All other azure objects (those that are not 1x2, or are 1x2 but not the lower-rightmost) are kept as they are in the input. All other non-azure pixels stay the same.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous blocks (objects) of a specified color in the grid.\n    Returns a list of bounding box coordinates, each as (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    def dfs(row, col, current_object):\n        \"\"\"Depth-First Search helper to find contiguous pixels.\"\"\"\n        if (row < 0 or row >= grid.shape[0] or col < 0 or col >= grid.shape[1] or\n                visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != color):\n            return\n\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        current_object.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, current_object)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, current_object)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, current_object)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, current_object)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[row, col] == color and not visited[row, col]:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(row, col, current_object)\n                if current_object:\n                    min_row, min_col = np.min(current_object, axis=0)\n                    max_row, max_col = np.max(current_object, axis=0)\n                    objects.append((min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col))\n\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid) # Start with a copy of the input\n    azure_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 8)\n\n    # Find the lower-rightmost 1x2 azure object\n    lower_right_object = None\n    for obj in azure_objects:\n        min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col = obj\n        if max_row - min_row == 0 and max_col - min_col == 1:  # Check for 1x2 shape\n            if lower_right_object is None:\n                lower_right_object = obj\n            else:  # Find the most lower-right object\n                if min_row > lower_right_object[0]:\n                    lower_right_object = obj\n                elif min_row == lower_right_object[0] and min_col > lower_right_object[1]:\n                    lower_right_object = obj\n\n    # Split and change the object\n    if lower_right_object is not None:\n        min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col = lower_right_object\n        output_grid[min_row, min_col] = 1  # Change first pixel to blue\n        #output_grid[max_row, max_col] = 8 #Second pixel is already azure (no change needed because of the np.copy)\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
