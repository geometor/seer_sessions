Okay, let's analyze the second example. The core concept seems consistent: manipulating azure objects and changing some pixels to blue. Here's the updated analysis:



```yaml
facts:
  input_grid_size: 7x7
  output_grid_size: 7x7
  colors_present_input: [0, 8]  # white, azure
  colors_present_output: [0, 1, 8]  # white, blue, azure
  objects_input:
    - shape: rectangle
      color: azure
      size: 2x2
      position: (0, 4)
    - shape: rectangle
      color: azure
      size: 1x1
      position: (1, 5)
    - shape: rectangle
      color: azure
      size: 2x1
      position: (2, 2)
    - shape: rectangle
      color: azure
      size: 2x2
      position: (3,2)
    - shape: rectangle
      color: azure
      size: 1x1
      position: (5,5)
    - shape: rectangle
      color: azure
      size: 1x2
      position: (6,3)
    - shape: rectangle
      color: azure
      size: 2x2
      position: (6,3)

  objects_output:
    - shape: rectangle
      color: azure
      size: 2x2
      position: (0, 4)
    - shape: rectangle # changed
      color: azure
      size: 1x1
      position: (0, 5) # first pixel of prev. object
    - shape: rectangle # changed
      color: blue
      size: 1x1
      position: (1, 4) # second pixel of prev. object.
    - shape: rectangle
      color: azure
      size: 2x1
      position: (2, 2)
     - shape: rectangle # changed
      color: blue
      size: 1x1
      position: (2,3)  # second pixel of prev. object.
    - shape: rectangle
      color: azure
      size: 2x2
      position: (3,2)

    - shape: rectangle  # changed
      color: blue
      size: 1x1
      position: (5, 4)  #first pixel of prev. object.
    - shape: rectangle  # changed
      color: azure
      size: 1x1
      position: (5, 5)   #second pixel of prev. object

    - shape: rectangle
      color: azure
      size: 2x2
      position: (6,3)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks (objects) of azure (8) pixels in the input.

2.  **Preserve 2x2 objects.** If the shape of azure object is 2x2, copy it into the output grid in exactly the same locations and shapes

3.  **Split 1x2 or 2x1 object into single pixels**: Divide the 1x2 or 2x1 object into two objects of size 1 x 1.

4.  **Change to blue**: Change the color of the left pixel to blue (1) for the 1x2 shape. Change the color of the top pixel to blue (1) for the 2x1 shape.

5. **Recolor and Split other 1x1 azure objects**: For the 1x1 objects, check their 4-way neighborhood.
    - If it has a neighbour on its left or on its top, it becomes blue.
    - If it hasn't, it stays azure.

6.  **Output Grid**: The result is placed in the output grid, keeping all other cells as white (0).

The previous python code needs to be updated to generalize the detection, splitting, and recoloring. It is not just about finding most lower right object, it is required to handle all 1x2 and 2x1 object.
It needs also to handle the 1x1 objects.



```python
import numpy as np

                    max_row, max_col = np.max(current_object, axis=0)
                    objects.append((min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col))

    return objects

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the described rule."""
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    azure_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 8)

    for obj in azure_objects:
      min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col = obj
      height = max_row - min_row + 1
      width = max_col - min_col + 1

        for r in range(min_row, max_row+1):

            output_grid[r,c] = 8

        else:
          output_grid[min_row, min_col] = 8
    return output_grid
```
