**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the objects:** The objects are cells in a 7x7 grid. Each cell has a numerical value (0, 1, or 8).
2. **Identify the predicate:** We are interested in cells that have a value of 0 and their neighbors.
3. **Describe the transformation:** For every cell in the input grid:
    - Check if the cell's value is 0.
    - If it is 0, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the *input* grid.
    - If any of these neighbors has a value of 8, then change the value of the current cell in the *output* grid to 1.
    - If the cell's value is not 0, or if none of its neighbors are 8, keep the cell's original value in the *output* grid.

**In simpler terms:**

For each empty cell (value 0) in the input grid, if any of its adjacent cells (up, down, left, or right) in the input grid is an '8', then fill this empty cell with '1' in the output grid. Otherwise, leave the cell as it is. Cells with values other than 0 are unchanged in the output.
**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again
