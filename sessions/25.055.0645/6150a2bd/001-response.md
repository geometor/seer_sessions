Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example and provide my observations, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The transformation appears to involve a rotation of the grid. The colors/values within the grid are preserved, but their positions change.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color_coded: true

actions:
  - type: rotation
    direction: counter-clockwise
    degrees: 90

relationships:
  - element_positions: change according to rotation
  - element_values: preserved during rotation
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The values of the grid elements (representing colors) are maintained, but their positions within the grid are updated based on the rotation.
