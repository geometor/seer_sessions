            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis of a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation was partially correct. It worked for the first training example. However, the subsequent tests show it doesn't hold for all cases. This suggests the transformation rule is more complex or context-dependent than initially assumed. The strategy should be to:\n\n1.  **Carefully examine the failures:** Analyze *why* the rotation failed in specific cases. Are there additional operations besides rotation? Are there conditions that determine when rotation happens?\n2.  **Identify consistent patterns:** Look for elements that *are* consistent across all input-output pairs, even the ones the current code fails on.\n3.  **Refine the description:** Update the natural language program to reflect the more nuanced rule, incorporating any conditions or additional steps.\n4.  **Object-Oriented Thinking:** Consider objects and properties explicitly.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code_execution where needed - shown inline for brevity):**\n\nI cannot execute the code here - so I'll have to make educated guesses and document. In the next phase I'll review the execution results and update.\n\n*   **Example 1:** (Correct)\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid.\n    *   Output: 3x3 grid, rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n    *   Observation: Rotation works as expected.\n\n*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid\n    *   Output: 5x5 grid. it looks like a 180-degree rotation.\n    *   Observation: Simple 90-degree CCW rotation is wrong.\n\n*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect)\n    *   Input: 11x11 grid\n    *   Output: 11x11 grid. A 270-degree rotation, or 90-degree clockwise\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  input:\n    grid_size: 3x3\n    objects:\n      - type: grid\n        properties: []\n  output:\n    grid_size: 3x3\n    objects:\n      - type: grid\n        properties: []\n  transformation:\n    type: rotation\n    details: 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n\nexample_2:\n  input:\n    grid_size: 5x5\n    objects:\n      - type: grid\n        properties: []\n  output:\n    grid_size: 5x5\n     objects:\n      - type: grid\n        properties: []\n  transformation:\n    type: rotation\n    details: 180 degrees counter-clockwise\n\nexample_3:\n  input:\n    grid_size: 11x11\n     objects:\n      - type: grid\n        properties: []\n  output:\n    grid_size: 11x11\n     objects:\n      - type: grid\n        properties: []\n  transformation:\n    type: rotation\n    details: 270 degrees counter-clockwise (or 90 degrees clockwise)\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe input grid is rotated counter-clockwise. The degree of rotation appears to be dependent on the example. Example 1 is a 90-degree rotation, example 2 is a 180-degree rotation, and example 3 is a 270-degree rotation.\n"
