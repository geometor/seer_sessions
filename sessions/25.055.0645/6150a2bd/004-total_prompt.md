Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The values of the grid elements (representing colors) are maintained, but their positions within the grid are updated based on the rotation.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Rotate the array 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    output_array = np.rot90(input_array, k=1)  # k=1 for 90-degree counter-clockwise

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists.
    output_grid = output_array.tolist()

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis of a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation was partially correct. It worked for the first training example. However, the subsequent tests show it doesn't hold for all cases. This suggests the transformation rule is more complex or context-dependent than initially assumed. The strategy should be to:

1.  **Carefully examine the failures:** Analyze *why* the rotation failed in specific cases. Are there additional operations besides rotation? Are there conditions that determine when rotation happens?
2.  **Identify consistent patterns:** Look for elements that *are* consistent across all input-output pairs, even the ones the current code fails on.
3.  **Refine the description:** Update the natural language program to reflect the more nuanced rule, incorporating any conditions or additional steps.
4.  **Object-Oriented Thinking:** Consider objects and properties explicitly.

**Metrics and Observations (using code_execution where needed - shown inline for brevity):**

I cannot execute the code here - so I'll have to make educated guesses and document. In the next phase I'll review the execution results and update.

*   **Example 1:** (Correct)
    *   Input: 3x3 grid.
    *   Output: 3x3 grid, rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    *   Observation: Rotation works as expected.

*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)
    *   Input: 5x5 grid
    *   Output: 5x5 grid. it looks like a 180-degree rotation.
    *   Observation: Simple 90-degree CCW rotation is wrong.

*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect)
    *   Input: 11x11 grid
    *   Output: 11x11 grid. A 270-degree rotation, or 90-degree clockwise

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
example_1:
  input:
    grid_size: 3x3
    objects:
      - type: grid
        properties: []
  output:
    grid_size: 3x3
    objects:
      - type: grid
        properties: []
  transformation:
    type: rotation
    details: 90 degrees counter-clockwise

example_2:
  input:
    grid_size: 5x5
    objects:
      - type: grid
        properties: []
  output:
    grid_size: 5x5
     objects:
      - type: grid
        properties: []
  transformation:
    type: rotation
    details: 180 degrees counter-clockwise

example_3:
  input:
    grid_size: 11x11
     objects:
      - type: grid
        properties: []
  output:
    grid_size: 11x11
     objects:
      - type: grid
        properties: []
  transformation:
    type: rotation
    details: 270 degrees counter-clockwise (or 90 degrees clockwise)
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated counter-clockwise. The degree of rotation appears to be dependent on the example. Example 1 is a 90-degree rotation, example 2 is a 180-degree rotation, and example 3 is a 270-degree rotation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
