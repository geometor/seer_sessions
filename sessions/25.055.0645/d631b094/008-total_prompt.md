## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 2 0
2 0 0
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x73226F237760>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x64 at 0x73226F236650>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid. The grid contains cells with values of 0 (white) and 2 (red).
*   **Output:** A 1x3 grid (a single row). All cells in the output are 2 (red).
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve collapsing or summarizing the input grid into a single row, retaining only the red cells (value 2) and discarding the white cells (value 0). It is extracting all of the 2s and creating a 1-d array.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 2
        color: red
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x3
    elements:
      - value: 2
        color: red
  - action: extract_red
    description: Extracts all red cells (value 2) from the input grid.
  - action: create_row
    description: Creates a single-row grid from the extracted red cells.
  - relationship: input_to_output
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid by extracting red cells and forming a single row.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all cells in the input grid that have the value 2 (red cells).
2.  **Extract** all red cells.
3.  Create a single row, and add the extracted red values to the row.
4. Discard any cells of value 0.

Essentially, the transformation extracts all red pixels and creates a 1xN grid where each value is 2 and N is the original number of 2's found.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
