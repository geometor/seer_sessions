## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 8 0
8 8 0
8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x73226F5CF3A0>

**output:**
```
8 8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x64 at 0x73226F5CF5B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 1x4 grid. The input grid contains pixels of color 0 (white) and color 8 (azure). The output grid contains only pixels of color 8 (azure). The number of azure pixels in the input equals the number of azure pixels of the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x3 grid.
  - observation: Output is a 1x4 grid.
  - object: Input grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - colors: [0, 8]
  - object: Output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 1x4
      - colors: [8]
  - relationship: Number of azure (8) pixels in input equals number of azure pixels in output.
  - action: Count azure pixels in input.
  - action: Create a 1xN grid where N is the count of azure pixels.
  - action: Fill the 1xN grid with color 8 (azure).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of azure (color 8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Construct:** Create a new output grid with dimensions 1 x N, where N is the count of azure pixels from step 1.
3.  **Fill:** Fill every pixel of the output grid with the color 8 (azure).

Essentially, the program extracts all the azure pixels from the input and creates a new 1D horizontal array containing only azure pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
