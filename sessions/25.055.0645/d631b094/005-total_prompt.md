Train Set Results:
Okay, here's an analysis of the provided code and results, along with a strategy for moving forward:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a misunderstanding of the very first example. The assumption was that a solid block of blue was the target, when in reality, the task involves identifying *azure* and replacing it with a single row of blue that is the length of the *count* of the azure squares. The code incorrectly identifies, counts, and replaces *black* squares. All examples happen to "pass" because there are three black pixels in every input and the output is always three blue pixels. Because every input generates an output of `[[1, 1, 1]]`, it just *looks* correct.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Gather Metrics:** I will use `code_execution` to confirm the counts of azure pixels in each input grid, and to confirm the dimensions of the grids. This ensures that this aspect of problem is consistent across all examples, training or test.
2.  **Refine Observations:** Create a YAML block that correctly identifies the objects, their properties, and actions.
3. **Rewrite Program:** Use the updated understanding to develop a new natural language program.

**Metrics Gathering (via Code Execution)**

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
