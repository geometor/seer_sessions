In other words, wherever a blue line has blank space on either side, it is extended, but if blue meets another blue pixel, then it isn't expanded on that side.\n3.  **Fill Bounded Areas:** Fill the areas that are boundaried by original blue lines and extended parts of the lines (from Step 2) with blue color.\n\nThis program describes how the blue lines seem to act as boundaries, and how the filling operation respects those boundaries, and how those boundaries are extended.\n"
