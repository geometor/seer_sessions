# Example

**input:**
```
0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 4 4 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x320 at 0x795F8581F370>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 4 4 0 1 1 0
0 2 2 0 4 4 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing colored squares. The colors are represented by digits (0-9). The primary colors observed are red (2), blue (1), and yellow (4). The background is white (0). The transformation seems to involve some form of rearrangement or shifting of colored blocks.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: square
    properties:
      color: [red, blue, yellow, white]
      size: [2x2, 1x1]
      position: [row, column]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [5x10]

actions:
  - type: shift
    properties:
        direction: [vertical, horizontal]
        magnitude: [number of cells]
  - type: reorder
    properties:
        order: [ relative positions within row]
relationships:
  - adjacency: objects can be adjacent
  - containment: grid contains objects
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the 2x2 colored squares (red, yellow, and blue) within the input grid.

2.  **Vertical Shift (Red):** The red square in the input grid shifts down by one row in the output grid, maintaining its original X coordinates (columns).

3.  **Vertical Shift(Yellow/Blue):** The yellow 2x2 square and the blue 2x2 squares swap their vertical position. This could also describe a rotation of these two objects

4. **Relative ordering within rows**: The colored objects are ordered by their leftmost edge, from left to right.

In summary, the transformation moves each colored object vertically, and within each row, maintains the original left-to-right order of the objects based on their leftmost position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
