  - task: 014
  - objects:
      - description: Contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color.
        properties:
          - color: Defined by the pixel value (0-9).
          - shape: Determined by the arrangement of pixels.
          - adjacency: Vertically adjacent blocks of the same color are significant.
  - actions:
      - merge: Vertically adjacent objects of the same color combine into one.
      - shift: All merged objects consolidate to the left of a row.
      - eliminate: If colored tiles do not have vertical adjacency, they may be eliminated.
      - remove_top_row: apply a padding of 0 to the grid to maintain the same number of input rows.
  - transformation_summary: |
    1. Merge and remove vertically adjacent objects by moving them to the top, and stacking them.
    2. Add background color to empty spots on the top row to keep the same height.
