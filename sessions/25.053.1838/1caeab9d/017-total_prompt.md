"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid to identify contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color. Each contiguous block is an object.
2.  **Merge Vertically Adjacent Objects:**
    *   Iterate through the grid, from top to bottom.
    *   For each column, identify vertically adjacent pixels that have the same color.
    *   Merge vertically adjacent pixels of the same color into a single object that occupies the rows of all merged pixels. Other tiles of different colors should be eliminated.
    *   Consolidate all merged objects to the left side of the row.
3.  **Maintain Grid Height:** Add an empty row to the top of the grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
