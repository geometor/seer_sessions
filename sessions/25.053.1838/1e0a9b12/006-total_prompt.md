Here's an assessment of the provided information and a strategy for resolving the errors, along with the requested deliverables:

**General Assessment:**

The code correctly identifies and extracts non-zero pixels. It also correctly sorts them by column and then row. However, the placement logic is flawed. It assumes there will always be enough space in the last row to accommodate all non-zero pixels. The `IndexError` in each example indicates that the code attempts to write beyond the bounds of the output grid's last row because it doesn't check the length of the `non_zero_pixels`. The core problem is an assumption of the code that the last row will be large enough, which will need to be addressed with changes in the sorting algorithm.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Count Non-zero Pixels:** Before placing pixels, determine the total number of non-zero pixels.
2.  **Dynamic Output Grid (if needed):** The current setup does not do this, but depending on the task, there could be a requirement to handle it.
3.  **Corrected Placement:** Ensure the code, during its placement in the bottom row, accounts for the size of the grid.

**Metrics and Reports:**

To provide the information, lets use the code to compute and display the error conditions.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify and Count:** Locate all non-zero pixels within the input grid and count them.
2.  **Collect**: Gather these non-zero pixels and store them, preserving their original value and their original input grid coordinates.
3.  **Sort**: Sort the collected pixels based first on the original input column and then the original input row, in ascending order for both.
4. **Place**: Starting at the bottom left most cell, place the sorted pixels into the last row of the output grid by iterating through all columns on that last row.
5.  **Fill**: Fill all the other cells in the output grid with the value 0.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
