Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial strategy of finding a bounding box, cropping, and rotating works for the first example but fails for the subsequent ones. The errors indicate two main issues:

1.  **Missing Color:** The code doesn't handle cases where the target color (red, represented by '2') is absent in the input grid, which happens in Examples 2 and 3 (blue object - 1 and azure object - 8). This leads to `None` values being returned by `get_bounding_box`, causing errors during the cropping stage.
2.  **Incorrect Object Selection:** The code assumes the target object is always red. This assumption is wrong, as seen in the other examples. We need a more general way to identify the object to be cropped and rotated.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Handle Missing Colors:** Modify `get_bounding_box` to return a default value (e.g., empty grid or specific coordinates) when the target color isn't found. This will prevent errors.
2. **Dynamic Object Detection:** Select an object that can vary in color by iterating the colors, skipping black (0).
3.  **Rotation:** The rotation needs to be clockwise by 90 degree.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** Contains a red object.
    *   **Expected Output:** Rotated red object.
    *   **Transformed Output:** Incorrect rotation and position.
    *   **Issues:** The transformed image is not correct (pixels are not in the correct positions)
*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** Contains a blue object (color 1).
    *   **Expected Output:** Rotated blue object.
    *  **Error:** runtime - cannot perform the rotation if the color to find
       the bounding box is provided

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:** Contains an azure object (color 8).
    *   **Expected Output:** Rotated azure object.
    *  **Error:** runtime - cannot perform the rotation if the color to find
       the bounding box is provided

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
examples:
  - id: 1
    object_color: red  # Initial assumption, needs to be generalized
    action: rotate_clockwise_90
    object_shape: irregular
    object_selection: bounding_box
  - id: 2
    object_color: blue
    action: rotate_clockwise_90
    object_shape: irregular
    object_selection: bounding_box
  - id: 3
    object_color: azure
    action: rotate_clockwise_90
    object_shape: irregular
    object_selection: bounding_box

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Object:** Find a non-black object within the input grid. Determine its color.
2.  **Bounding Box:** Define a bounding box around the identified object.
3.  **Crop:** Extract the section of the grid defined by the bounding box.
4.  **Rotate:** Rotate the cropped section clockwise by 90 degrees.
5.  **Output:** Return the rotated section.
