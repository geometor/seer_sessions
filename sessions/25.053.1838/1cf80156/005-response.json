            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting Python code correctly identify a key aspect of the transformation: finding a non-black object, creating a bounding box, and cropping. However, the rotation logic is consistently failing to match the expected output. The generated outputs are rotated, but not in the way the examples demonstrate. The core issue seems to be the direction and possibly the origin point of the rotation. It appears we need to perform more advanced analysis.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Rotation:** Carefully analyze the input and expected output pairs to determine the *precise* nature of the rotation. Is it always clockwise? Is the center of rotation the center of the bounding box, or some other point? The images of the transformed results are very helpful for this purpose.\n2.  **Object Identification** Ensure the target color identification is correct and working as expected.\n3.  **Orientation** Use the image of the failed result to help to see how the rotation should be done.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations and potential issues:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (12, 12)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Transformed Output Shape: (4,4)\n    *   Target Color: Red (2)\n    *   Observation: The transformed output is rotated 90 degrees clockwise relative to the expected output. The red object in the lower left corner of the input appears rotated to the lower right.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (12, 12)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 3)\n    *   Transformed Output Shape: (3,5)\n    *   Target Color: Blue (1)\n    *   Observation: The transformed output has swapped width and height compared to the expected output, indicating a -90-degree or 270-degree rotation.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (12, 12)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 5)\n    *   Transformed Output Shape: (5,3)\n    *   Target Color: Azure (8)\n    *   Observation: Again, width and height are swapped, indicating a -90 degree or 270-degree rotation, the inverse of the currently coded 90-degree rotation.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task_id: 004-py\n  - example_1:\n      input_object:\n        color: 2\n        shape_type: rectangle-like\n        bounding_box: [[2, 5], [4, 6]]  # [min_row, max_row], [min_col, max_col]\n      transformation:\n        type: rotation\n        rotation_type: clockwise\n        degrees: -90\n      output_object:\n          bounding_box: [[0,3], [0,3]]\n  - example_2:\n      input_object:\n        color: 1\n        shape_type: irregular\n        bounding_box: [[1, 5], [2, 4]]\n      transformation:\n        type: rotation\n        rotation_type: clockwise\n        degrees: -90\n      output_object:\n          bounding_box: [[0,4], [0,2]] #estimated\n  - example_3:\n      input_object:\n        color: 8\n        shape_type: rectangle-like\n        bounding_box: [[3, 5], [3, 7]]\n      transformation:\n         type: rotation\n         rotation_type: clockwise\n         degrees: -90\n      output_object:\n          bounding_box: [[0,4], [0,2]]\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Target Object:** Find the first contiguous non-black object (a block of pixels of the same color) within the input grid. Note its color.\n2.  **Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangular bounding box that encloses the target object.\n3.  **Crop:** Extract the section of the input grid defined by the bounding box.\n4.  **Rotate:** Rotate the cropped section *counter-clockwise* by 90 degrees (or 270 degrees clockwise).\n5.  **Output:** Return the rotated section as the output grid.\n"
