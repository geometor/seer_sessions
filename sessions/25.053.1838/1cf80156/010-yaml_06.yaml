task: extract_nonzero_subgrid
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [list of integers, varies per example]
      - shape: [rows, cols]
  - name: nonzero_subgrid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [same as input_grid, but without 0]
      - shape: [rows', cols'] #derived from bounding box
    description: |
        The smallest rectangular subgrid containing all
        non-zero pixels in the input_grid.
actions:
  - name: find_bounding_box
    input: input_grid
    output: [top, left, bottom, right] #coordinates
    description: |
      Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices
      containing non-zero pixels.
  - name: extract_subgrid
    input:
      - input_grid
      - bounding_box
    output: nonzero_subgrid
    description: |
