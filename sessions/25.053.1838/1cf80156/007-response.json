The input grid contains a connected shape made of blue (1) pixels against a background of white (0) pixels. This shape resembles a stylized, downward-pointing arrow or triangle. The output grid appears to be a cropped and possibly rotated/reflected version of the blue shape in the input, with the surrounding white pixels removed.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This constitutes the \"shape\".\n2.  **Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangular bounding box that completely encloses the shape.\n3.  **Crop:** Extract the portion of the grid within the bounding box, removing all surrounding rows and columns containing only white (0) pixels.\n4.  **Orientation?**: a transformation is performed, best described as selecting a minimal set of rows and columns that fully enclose the extracted shape.\n\nThe transformation's essence is extracting the core shape, removing the extraneous background, and reorienting the extracted portion.\n"
