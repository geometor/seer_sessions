"""
1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the connected region of non-zero pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Bounding shape:** identify the smallest rectangle that fits the object.
3. **Area Calculation**: calculate the area of that rectangle
4.  **Construct Transformed Shape:** Starting from the top-left corner, form the square with the closest area by expanding 1 unit in each direction (up, down, right, left)
5.  **Color Transformation:** All original colors of the object change to the most frequent color of the original object, in this case yellow (4).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
