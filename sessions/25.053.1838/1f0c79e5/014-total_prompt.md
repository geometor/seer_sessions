Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, broken down into perceptions, a YAML fact block, and a natural language program.

**Perception:**

The input grid contains a small 2x2 square of magenta (6) and red (2) pixels near the center. The output grid seems to be a mirrored and rotated version of this square, but expanded and using only the magenta (6) color. The transformation inverts the 2x2 block, placing the '6' values on the opposite, and expands outwards, it also rotates the output so it fills the corner.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: initial_shape
    type: rectangle
    dimensions: 2x2
    colors: [magenta, red]
    position: near_center

  - object: transformed_shape
    type: rectangle
    dimensions: 9x9 # expanded to fill output grid
    color: magenta
    position: fills_grid_from_corner

  - action: inversion
    description: The colors of original 2x2 grid are inverted

  - action: fill
    description: output grid is filled with new color
    details: original shape in the corner

  - relationship: mirroring
    description: 2x2 group seems to be rotating and expanding around the original grid.

  - relationship: color_change
    description: only magenta remains, red is replaced with magenta

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the 2x2 block of pixels near the center of the input grid with 2 magenta (6), and 2 red (2) pixels.
2. **Inversion** select the original square and invert the colors, the red (2) becomes magenta (6).
3.  **Expansion:** Expand the magenta color to fill the grid, starting from the
    bottom left corner.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
