facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    size: 9x9
    description: Contains a central cluster of non-zero pixels.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    size: 9x9
    description: Contains a pattern of orange pixels ('7') and white pixels ('0').
  - object: central_cluster
    type: object
    location: input_grid
    colors: [2, 7] # red, orange
    description: The non-zero pixels in the input grid.
  - action: transformation
    type: grid_to_grid
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Transforms the input grid into the output grid based on a rule.
  - relationship: spatial_influence
    description: The position and values of the central_cluster in the input_grid likely determine the pattern in the output_grid.
  - pattern: output pattern is a mirrored, rotated version of the input pixels
