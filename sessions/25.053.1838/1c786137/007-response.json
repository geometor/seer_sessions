The input grid contains a variety of colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a condensed representation, possibly focusing on specific features or regions within the input.  The input contains distinct regions of color, notably a large block of '4' (yellow) on the left, surrounded by various other colors. The output grid is significantly smaller and doesn't retain the entire structure of the input. The output seems to capture pixels from the upper left section of each object.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Consider each of these blocks as a separate object.\n\n2. **Object Representation**: Extract the object in the top, left-most, corner of the input grid.\n\n3.  **Object Truncation and Sampling**: select the top-left 3x3 sub-grid of the input grid, and transform each of its 3 columns to 5 rows to create the output grid by the following sub-steps:\n   * For column 1: Keep, the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, and 13th element.\n   * For column 2: Keep, the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, and 13th element.\n   * For column 3: Keep, the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 9th, and 10th element.\n\n4. **Output Formation:** Arrange the truncated columns side-by-side to create output grid.\n"
