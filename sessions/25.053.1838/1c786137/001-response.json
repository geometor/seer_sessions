The input grid appears to contain various colors, while the output grid also contains a subset of those colors. The core operation seems to be a selection or extraction of a specific region from the input, potentially based on a recognizable shape, and some form of reduction or downscaling. The black borders in the images provide a visual aid and highlight important areas. The output grid appears to resemble a much smaller and roughly central section of the full image, keeping only cells which were inside a large shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
