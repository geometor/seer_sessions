```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1024x832 at 0x795F8581EEF0>

**output:**
```
3 3 0
9 3 9
6 6 0
9 0 0
6 3 9
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger, more complex grid (input) into a smaller, simpler grid (output). The input grid contains a variety of colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a condensed representation, possibly focusing on specific features or regions within the input.  The input contains distinct regions of color, notably a large block of '4' (yellow) on the left, surrounded by various other colors. The output grid is significantly smaller and doesn't retain the entire structure of the input. The output seems to capture pixels from the upper left section of each object.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 13 x 17
      - colors: [0, 6, 9, 3, 4]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5 x 3
      - colors: [0, 3, 6, 9]
  - name: yellow_region
    type: object
    properties:
      - color: 4
      - shape: roughly rectangular
      - location: left side of input_grid
  - name: pixel_selection
    type: process
    description: "Selection of specific pixels from input to construct the output grid"

actions:
  - type: condensation
    description: Reducing the input grid to a smaller output grid.
  - type: feature_extraction
    description: Possibly selecting representative pixels or summarizing regions.

relationships:
  - input_grid:contains:yellow_region
  - output_grid:represents:input_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify distinct objects:** In the input grid, locate contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color. Consider each of these blocks as a separate object.

2. **Object Representation**: Extract the object in the top, left-most, corner of the input grid.

3.  **Object Truncation and Sampling**: select the top-left 3x3 sub-grid of the input grid, and transform each of its 3 columns to 5 rows to create the output grid by the following sub-steps:
   * For column 1: Keep, the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, and 13th element.
   * For column 2: Keep, the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, and 13th element.
   * For column 3: Keep, the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 9th, and 10th element.

4. **Output Formation:** Arrange the truncated columns side-by-side to create output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
