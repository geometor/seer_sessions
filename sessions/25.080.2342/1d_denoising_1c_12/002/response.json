It then removes all other instances of that color, leaving only the largest block and the background (color 0).  The problem is that the examples clearly show that the intended behavior is to remove *all* pixels of colors that are not part of the largest contiguous non-zero color block.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Dimensions:** Confirm that all examples are indeed 1D grids (single rows).\n2.  **Identify Largest Block:** The current `find_largest_contiguous_block` function seems correct for finding the largest block within a single row.\n3.  **Revised Transformation Logic:** Instead of preserving only the largest block of the *same* color, we need to:\n    *   Find the largest contiguous block (as the code already does).\n    *   Identify the color of that block.\n    *   Remove *all pixels* in the grid which aren't 0, that do not match the target color.\n    *   Return the largest contiguous block.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (using code execution):**\nBecause this code works on 1D grids, it simplifies the testing.\n\n"
