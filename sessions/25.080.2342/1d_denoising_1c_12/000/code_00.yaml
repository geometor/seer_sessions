facts:
  - object: grid
    description: one dimensional array of pixels represented by integers
    properties:
      - width: 32
      - height: 1
  - object: color_block
    description: contiguous set of pixels with same value
  - observation: In all examples, there's one long continuous sequence of the same color, and some individual instances of the same color.
  - observation: Only colors other than 0 are affected.
  - observation: color blocks of color 0 are unchanged
  - action: remove
    description: isolated pixels of the target color are removed
  - action: preserve
    description: the largest contiguous block of the target color is kept
  - relationship:
      type: spatial
      description: relative positions - isolated vs contiguous
