  - task_id: 1c11f8e4
  - description: Remove runs of non-zero digits that are bounded by zeros.
  - objects:
      - type: grid
        description: 1D array of digits.
      - type: digit
        values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        description: Represents colors. 0 is special for boundary condition.
      - type: run
        description: Contiguous sequence of the same non-zero digit.
        properties:
          - start_index: Integer. Index of the first digit in the run.
          - end_index: Integer. Index of the last digit in the run.
          - digit_value: Integer. The value of the digit in the run.
  - actions:
      - name: identify_runs
        input: grid
        output: list of runs
        description: Find all runs in the grid.
      - name: check_boundaries
        input: run, grid
        output: boolean
        description: Determine if the run is bounded by zeros at both ends within grid boundaries.
      - name: remove_run
        input: grid, run
        output: grid
        description: Remove the specified run from the grid.
  - transformation_rule: |
    1. Identify all runs of non-zero digits in the input grid.
    2. For each run, check if it's bounded by zeros (or the edge of the grid).
    3. If a run is bounded by zeros, remove the entire run from the grid.
    4. The resulting grid is the output.
