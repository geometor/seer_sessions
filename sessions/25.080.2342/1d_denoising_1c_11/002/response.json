            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple \"remove digits surrounded by zeros\" rule. This works for some cases but fails to capture the more nuanced pattern in the provided examples. The core issue is that the code only considers *immediate* neighbors. The actual rule appears to involve removing digits within *runs* of zeros. The expected outputs show that entire sequences (runs) of a color bordered by zeros are removed. We need to shift from a local, neighbor-based approach to a run-based approach.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Run-Based Removal:** Analyze the examples to confirm that the rule involves removing entire runs of non-zero digits that are bounded by zeros. We'll check lengths of runs and confirm if any partial runs remain.\n2.  **Identify Edge Cases:** Pay close attention to what happens at the very beginning and end of the input sequence. Are leading or trailing non-zero digits treated differently?\n3.  **Develop Revised Program:**  Re-describe the transformation using run-based logic in the natural language program.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Evidence (using code execution where necessary):**\n\nI will manually analyze the examples since code execution isn't directly applicable to determining the \"rule\". I'll focus on characterizing the runs and boundary conditions.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n    *   Expected Output: `3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n    *   Observation: A run of one '3' between zeros is removed. A run of a single '3' surrounded by zeros is removed.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n    *   Expected Output: `0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n    *    Observation: Single '7's surrounded by runs of 0s are removed.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `0 0 4 0 0 0 0 4 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0`\n    *   Expected Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n    *   Observation: Single '4's surrounded by zeros are removed. The long sequence of 4s is kept.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
