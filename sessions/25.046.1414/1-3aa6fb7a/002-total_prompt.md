Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Two separate L-shaped structures, one mirrored.
      position:
        - Top-left corner at (1,1).
        - Bottom-right corner at (4,5)
      count: 2

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Two L-shaped structures, same as input.
      position:
        - Top-left corner at (1,1).
        - Bottom-right corner at (4,5)
        
      count: 2
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single pixel
      position:
        - (1,2)
        - (4,4)

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid. In this case, there are two L-shaped objects.

2.  **Preserve:** Copy those objects to the output grid without changes.

3.  **Change**: Find every azure object that is adjacent with only one cell in its x or y axis to a blue cell.

**Elaboration and Key Insights**

*   The core transformation is to add blue cell to the azure objects.
*   The positions of the new blue cells in the output are the cells near the azure cells.

This natural language program captures the essence of the transformation observed between the input and output grids.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    expected_output = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    print()
    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
