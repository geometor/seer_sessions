Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Two separate L-shaped structures, one mirrored.
      position:
        - Top-left corner at (1,1).
        - Bottom-right corner at (4,5)
      count: 2

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Two L-shaped structures, same as input.
      position:
        - Top-left corner at (1,1).
        - Bottom-right corner at (4,5)
        
      count: 2
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single pixel
      position:
        - (1,2)
        - (4,4)

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid. In this case, there are two L-shaped objects.

2.  **Preserve:** Copy those objects to the output grid without changes.

3.  **Change**: Find every azure object that is adjacent with only one cell in its x or y axis to a blue cell.

**Elaboration and Key Insights**

*   The core transformation is to add blue cell to the azure objects.
*   The positions of the new blue cells in the output are the cells near the azure cells.

This natural language program captures the essence of the transformation observed between the input and output grids.

Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Scattered L and line shapes, various orientations.
      position:
        - Top-right corner.
        - Middle-left.
        - Bottom-right.
      count: 3 groups

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Same as input.
      position: Same as input
      count: 3 groups
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single pixel
      position: Adjacent to azure pixels, where the azure pixel has only one azure neighbor.
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.

2.  **Preserve:** Copy all azure objects to the output grid without changing their positions or shapes.

3.  **Change:** For each azure (color 8) pixel, count the number of adjacent azure pixels (horizontally and vertically, not diagonally). If an azure pixel has exactly one adjacent azure pixel, and the neighboring position in the direction opposite to it is 0, add a blue pixel(color 1) at the empty(color 0) available position.

**Elaboration and Key Insights**

*   The core transformation is the addition of blue pixels adjacent to specific azure pixels.
*   The rule for adding blue pixels is based on the number of adjacent azure pixels: only azure pixels with exactly one azure neighbor receive an adjacent blue pixel, and only when available.
* The previous implementation is consistent with the new example.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
