**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation process begins by examining the input grid for a specific pattern: a column where all cells are of color gray (color 5). If such a column is found anywhere in the input grid, the transformation rule is triggered. This rule dictates the generation of a fixed 3x3 output grid.  In this output grid, the central cell (at row index 1, column index 1, using zero-based indexing) is set to red (color 2), and all other cells within this 3x3 grid are set to white (color 0). The presence of the gray column in the input grid serves as a condition to initiate this transformation, but its position or any other attributes do not further influence the resultant 3x3 output grid, which always remains the same once triggered.

**YAML Block:**

```yaml
task_context: "ARC-AGI grid puzzle transformation"
input_observations:
  grid_dimensions: "3x7"
  colors_present: [0, 1, 5]
  objects:
    gray_column:
      predicate: "exists"
      color: 5
      location: "column index 3"
      property: "all cells in column are gray"
    blue_objects:
      predicate: "exists"
      color: 1
      description: "scattered blue cells in different rows"
    white_objects:
      predicate: "exists"
      color: 0
      description: "white background regions"
output_observations:
  grid_dimensions: "3x3"
  colors_present: [0, 2]
  objects:
    red_center:
      predicate: "exists"
      color: 2
      location: "center cell (1,1)"
    white_background:
      predicate: "exists"
      color: 0
      description: "all cells except the center are white"
transformation_rule:
  condition: "input grid contains a column where all cells are gray (color 5)"
  action: "create a 3x3 output grid with a red center (color 2) and white background (color 0)"
  steps:
    - step_1: "Check for the existence of a gray column in the input grid."
    - step_2: "If a gray column is found, create a 3x3 grid."
    - step_3: "Fill the 3x3 grid with color 0 (white)."
    - step_4: "Set the center cell (1,1) of the 3x3 grid to color 2 (red)."
    - step_5: "Output the resulting 3x3 grid."
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
