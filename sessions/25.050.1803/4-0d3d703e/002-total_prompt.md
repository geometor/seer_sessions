**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a simple color replacement. For each cell in the input grid, perform the following color mapping: change color 3 (green) to color 4 (yellow), color 1 (blue) to color 5 (gray), and color 2 (red) to color 6 (magenta).  In essence, each distinct color present in the input grid is replaced by a new, distinct color in the output grid.
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
