observations:
  - input_grid: |
      - The input grid is 8x10.
      - Contains digits '0' and '5'.
      - The digit '5' forms several distinct shapes, including horizontal lines and vertical segments.
  - output_grid: |
      - The output grid is also 8x10.
      - Contains digits '0', '8', and '2'.
      - The digit '8' replaces some of the '5's, and '2' replaces others, based on their shape and position.

transformation_rules:
  - rule: |
      Replace specific shapes formed by '5' with '8' or '2'. L-shaped structures and horizontal lines of '5' are replaced by '8', while isolated or other specific patterns are replaced by '2'. The rule distinguishes between different configurations of '5's to determine the replacement.
