Any empty spaces created at the top of the columns in the output grid are filled with white color (0).\n\n**Step-by-step transformation:**\n\n1. **Column-wise Processing:** The transformation is applied independently to each column of the input grid.\n2. **Identify Non-Zero Objects:** For each column, identify all the cells that are not white (color 0).\n3. **Preserve Vertical Order:** Note the order of these non-zero objects from top to bottom within the column.\n4. **Move to Bottom:** In the output grid, for the same column index, place these non-zero objects in the bottom-most rows, maintaining the same vertical order identified in step 3.\n5. **Fill with White:** Fill all the rows above the placed non-zero objects in the output column with white color (0).\n6. **Repeat for All Columns:** Repeat steps 2-5 for every column in the input grid.\n\nThis process results in an output grid where all the colored objects from each input column are stacked at the bottom of the corresponding output column, with any remaining space at the top of the columns filled with white."
