Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
      shape: Two separate L-shaped objects.
  dimensions: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
      shape:  Two separate L-shaped objects. Same as input.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: Two single-cell objects.
  dimensions: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).
2.  **Preservation:** The two azure L-shaped structures from the input are kept unchanged in the output.
3. **Change Detection:** Now we look for changes:
    *   The cell at (1, 2) is now a blue cell. In the input it was a white cell (color 0).
    *   The cell at (4, 4) is now a blue cell. In the input it was a white cell (color 0).
4. **Find the changed cells**: Check the cells that are to the immediate right (neighbor) of the top left corner of the azure objects. If those cells has color 0 (white), change those cells to have color 1 (blue).

**Step-by-step description in simple terms**:

The rule seems to change the color of cells to the right the top-left-corner of color 8 (azure) "L" shapes.
- The cell to the right of the uppermost-leftmost azure cell, is changed to blue.
- The cell to the right of the other L-shape uppermost-leftmost azure cell is changed to blue.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
