Same as input.\n    - color: 1 (blue)\n      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]\n      shape: Three single-cell objects.\n  dimensions: 7x7\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify three distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).\n2.  **Preservation:** The three azure L-shaped structures from the input are kept unchanged in the output.\n3. **Change Detection:** Now we look for changes:\n    *   The cell at (1, 4) is now a blue cell. In the input it was a white cell (color 0).\n    *   The cell at (2, 3) is now a blue cell. In the input it was a white cell (color 0).\n    *   The cell at (5, 3) is now a blue cell. In the input it was a white cell (color 0).\n4. **Find the changed cells**: Check the cells that are to the immediate left (neighbor) of the top right corner of the azure objects. If those cells has color 0 (white), change those cells to have color 1 (blue).\n\n**Step-by-step description in simple terms**:\n\nThe rule seems to change the color of cells to the *left* the top-*right*-corner of color 8 (azure) \"L\" shapes.\n\n- The cell to the left of the uppermost-rightmost azure cell of each L-shape, is changed to blue.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule preserves three L-shaped azure objects and changes the color of the cells immediately to the left of their top-right corners from white (0) to blue (1).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds connected regions of the specified color and returns a list of their coordinates.\n    Uses a simple flood-fill algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    def flood_fill(r, c, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not is_valid(r, c) or grid[r, c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            flood_fill(r + dr, c + dc, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_object = []\n                flood_fill(r, c, current_object)\n                objects.append(current_object)\n\n    return objects\ndef get_top_right(obj):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gets the top-right coordinate of an object.\n    \"\"\"\n    min_row = float('inf')\n    max_col = float('-inf')\n\n    for r, c in obj:\n        if r < min_row:\n            min_row = r\n        if c > max_col:\n          max_col = c\n    return min_row,max_col\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the rule:\n    1.  Identify azure (color 8) L-shaped objects.\n    2.  Preserve their structure.\n    3. Change to blue the cells to the left of the top-right-corner\n    of each object, from white (color 0)\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    azure_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 8)\n\n    # Iterate through the azure objects\n    for obj in azure_objects:\n      #find top-right corner\n      top_right_r, top_right_c = get_top_right(obj)\n      #check if the cell to the left exists and it is color 0\n      if top_right_c - 1 >= 0  and output_grid[top_right_r,top_right_c - 1] == 0:\n        output_grid[top_right_r, top_right_c - 1] = 1\n    return output_grid\n```\n\n**Evaluation and Refinement**\n\nThe first example had to do with the top-left corner.\n\nI've changed now `get_top_left` to `get_top_right` and `min_col` to `max_col`, because this time we must look at the top-right corner.\nAlso, I have changed  `if top_left_c + 1 < output_grid.shape[1] and output_grid[top_left_r,top_left_c + 1] == 0:` to `if top_right_c - 1 >= 0  and output_grid[top_right_r,top_right_c - 1] == 0:` because now we check if the cell at the *left* exists, not at the right.\n"
