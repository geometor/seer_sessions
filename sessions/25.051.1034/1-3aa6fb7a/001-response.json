In this case, we have two such objects: a vertical line and a horizontal line.\n\n2.  **Preserve Objects:** The azure objects are unchanged between input and output.\n\n3. **Introduce New Color:** For each of the two original azure objects, add a blue (color 1) pixel. The blue pixel should be put to the right of the bottom of the Object 1. The blue pixel should be put on the left of the top pixel of Object 2.\n\n**Elaboration**\nThe main rule is to add specific colored pixels to identified objects in specific positions.\n"
