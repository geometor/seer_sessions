In this case, there are two 2x1 vertical lines of azure color.\n\n2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** These azure objects remain unchanged in their position and shape in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Introduce Blue Pixels:**\n    *   The top-most cell immediately to the right of the top pixel of an azure line is changed to blue (color code 1).\n    *   The bottom-most cell immediately to the left of the bottom pixel of an azure line is changed to blue (color code 1).\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n```\n1. Copy all the 8-colored (azure) pixels from the input grid to the output grid, with no changes.\n2. Select the first 8-colored object on the left. Paint color 1 the cell beside the topmost 8-colored cell.\n3. Select the last 8-colored object on the right. Paint color 1 the cell beside the bottom-most 8-colored cell.\n4. All other cells remain 0-colored (white).\n```\n"
