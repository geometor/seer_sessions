## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x384 at 0x75AD93DE84D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 8 0 8 8 0 8
0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8
0 0 0 8 8 0 0 8 8
0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are azure (8), yellow (4), and white (0). The input contains two distinct colored regions: an azure region at the top and a yellow region at the bottom. The transformation seems to selectively modify the azure region.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [6, 9] # 6 rows, 9 columns
      colors: [0, 4, 8]
  - type: region
    properties:
      color: 8  # Azure
      shape: irregular
      location: top
  - type: region
    properties:
      color: 4  # Yellow
      shape: irregular
      location: bottom
actions:
  - type: modify
    target: region
    properties:
      color: 8
      rule: extend_right_selectively
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: [region_8, region_4]
    description: above/below
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate the distinct azure (8) and yellow (4) regions within the input grid.
2.  **Focus on Azure Region:** Consider only the azure region for modification.
3. **Conditional right extension**
    *   If in the azure region, an azure pixel is not on the far right edge of the grid, examine the pixel to the direct right.
    *   If the pixel on the direct right is white, change it to azure.

In simpler terms, the azure color expands to the right, filling white cells directly adjacent to azure cells, but the other region is unaffected.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
