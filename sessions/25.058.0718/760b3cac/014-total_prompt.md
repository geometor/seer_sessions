## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x384 at 0x75AD93DAB7D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0
8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 2D array of digits (0-9), representing colors.
*   **Output Grid:** A 2D array with the same dimensions as the input, but with some digits changed.
*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same color. In this specific example, we see azure (8) and yellow (4) objects. White (0) is the background.
*   **Transformations:** The azure (8) object seems to be undergoing some change, while the yellow (4) object is unchanged. The primary change appears to be in the top left azure object.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - shape: irregular
      - initial_position: top-left, center-right
    actions:
      - modified: true
      - type: horizontal mirroring of top shape

  - color: yellow (4)
    properties:
      - shape: irregular
      - position: bottom-center
    actions:
      - modified: false

  - color: white (0)
      properties:
       - role: background
       - modified: false
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels.
2.  **Target Object:** Find the azure object at the top.
3. **Mirror:** Reflect the first three rows, containing azure, horizontally.
4.  **Preserve:** All other objects and the background remain unchanged.
5. **Output:** combine the mirrored and the un-mirrored parts.

Essentially the transformation rule seemes to be mirroring the top azure object.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
