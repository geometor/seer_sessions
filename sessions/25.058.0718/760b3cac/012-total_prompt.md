Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, and it performs a region-expansion of azure (8) pixels, primarily to the right and down, constrained by yellow (4) pixels. However, the results on the other training examples reveal that this approach is incomplete or incorrect. The strategy to improve is to:

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine where the generated output differs from the expected output in each example. This will pinpoint the specific aspects of the transformation that the current code fails to capture.
2.  **Identify Corrected Rules:** Based on the mismatches, deduce the *actual* rules governing the transformation. This might involve realizing it's not just simple expansion, or there are other colors/shapes playing crucial roles.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language description to reflect the corrected rules in a clear, concise way.
4.  **Consider all examples:** the updated program must account for *all* examples, not just the first one.

**Metrics and Observations**

To get detailed metrics, I'll construct observation reports for each example pair.

**Example 0**

*   **Input Grid:** 15x15, azure(8), yellow(4), white(0)
*   **Output Grid:** 15x15, azure(8), yellow(4), white(0)
*  The generated output matches the expected output

**Example 1**

*   **Input Grid:** 11x11, azure(8), yellow(4), white(0)
*   **Output Grid:** 11x11, azure(8), yellow(4), white(0)
*   The generated output does not match the expected output. The azure expands downwards to create a rectangle, it should expand on all sides.

**Example 2**

*   **Input Grid:** 19x19, azure(8), yellow(4), white(0)
*   **Output Grid:** 19x19, azure(8), yellow(4), white(0)
*   The generated output does not match the expected output. The azure should expand on all sides, including diagonally to create the largest possible rectangle.

**Example 3**

*   **Input Grid:** 13x11, azure(8), yellow(4), white(0)
*   **Output Grid:** 13x11, azure(8), yellow(4), white(0)
*   The generated output does not match the expected output. There is a single isolated azure, it should expand in all directions to fill the available space.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 0
    objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: irregular
        action: expand to fill available space, maintaining rectangular form, constrained by yellow
      - color: yellow (4)
        shape: irregular
        action: remain unchanged

  - example_id: 1
    objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: irregular
        action: expand to fill available space, maintaining rectangular form, constrained by yellow
      - color: yellow (4)
        shape: irregular
        action: remain unchanged

  - example_id: 2
    objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: irregular
        action: expand to fill available space, maintaining rectangular form, constrained by yellow
      - color: yellow (4)
        shape: irregular
        action: remain unchanged

  - example_id: 3
    objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: single pixel
        action: expand to fill available space, maintaining rectangular form
      - color: yellow (4)
        shape: none
        action: none
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels and yellow (4) pixels.
2.  **Azure Expansion:** For each azure region:
    *   Expand the azure region in all directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) to the maximum extent possible, filling any white (0) pixels.
    * The expansion of the azure areas are constrained by yellow pixels.
    * The expansion will always maintain a rectangular shape.
3.  **Yellow Remains:** Yellow regions remain unchanged.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
