The grids contain single-digit integers (0, 4, and 8) representing different colors (white, yellow, and azure, respectively).  The non-zero digits appear to form distinct objects. The transformation seems to affect only the azure (8) objects, while the yellow (4) object remains unchanged. The azure objects in the top rows are modified.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Consider each block a separate object.\n2.  **Preserve Yellow:** The yellow (4) object, and the white (0) background are invariant. Do not modify its position or shape.\n3. **Transform Azure:** Modify the azure (8) object.\n4. **Left align and extend.** Move all azure pixels to the left, occupying column one if available.\n5. **Fill three rows** If necessary continue adding the azure (8) pixels in columns to the right. Extend/Fill the first three rows of the grid completely.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule can be summarized as: \"Preserve the yellow object, move all azure pixels to the left, and fill the first three rows.\"\n"
