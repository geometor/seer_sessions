            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code have a fundamental flaw in how they handle the replacement of non-zero values with '3'. The code seems to *sometimes* replace non-zero values correctly, but there's inconsistency. It initializes the `output_grid` with all 3s, but then incorrectly overwrites those values in some cases. This is likely a simple logic problem. The strategy will be to adjust the code to correctly fill the region above the yellow line.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the discrepancies:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 5)\n    *   Issue: The code does not accurately convert all non-zero values above the yellow line to '3'. It keeps the top row of the input, then selectively converts cells to 3's.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 5)\n    *   Issue: Similar to example 1. Some values were missed in the conversion to all 3s, and some 0 values got missed.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 5)\n    *   Issue: Similar error, the initial row of zeros and non-zeros is copied, and some cells aren't getting converted to 3.\n*  **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Shape: (9,5)\n    *    Output Shape: (4,5)\n    *    Issue: Similar issue with incorrect 3 value filling.\n\nThe core issue is how the copy mechanism.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

If a pixel is '0' (white), set the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to '0' (white). All other cells in the output should remain 3.\n5.  **Ignore Below Separator**: The part of the input grid below the separator line has no effect on the output.\n\n"
