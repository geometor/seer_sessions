            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was a good first attempt, focusing on row reordering based on the first and second elements. However, it's clear from the test results that the logic is incomplete and needs significant adjustments. The code correctly identifies rows starting with `6` for special treatment, but it doesn't handle the reordering and filtering logic accurately for all cases. The expected outputs show a more complex pattern of row manipulation, involving sorting based on multiple criteria and conditional row removal. The code is also removing a row that starts with a 2, and that rule is not consistent between the test cases.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I need to meticulously examine each input-output pair to understand the precise rules governing row movement and removal. This will involve not just the first element, but potentially other elements in the row and even the overall row structure.\n2.  **Refine Conditions:** The current conditions for moving and removing rows (`move_starts`, `remove_starts`) are overly simplistic. I need to determine the *exact* conditions that dictate these actions. This will likely involve a more complex set of rules than just checking the first element.\n3.  **Multi-Level Sorting:** The sorting based on the second element is a good start, but it might not be sufficient. I'll need to consider if sorting is based on other elements or combinations of elements, and in what order.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** I'll adjust the natural language program and the code iteratively, testing against each example after each change, to ensure I'm converging towards the correct transformation logic.\n5. **Consider Objectness:** The prompt talked about identifying objects, I will look for contigous groups of the same number and how those move as a whole.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analyze Examples (using code execution):**\n\nI'll use `numpy` to analyze the grids, determine row lengths, unique values in each row, and how these relate to the output.\n\n"
