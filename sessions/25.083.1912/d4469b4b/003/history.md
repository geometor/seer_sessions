The transformation extracts a simplified representation of the input grid. It reduces any input grid to a 3x3 output grid. If the input grid contains any non-zero values, the output grid will have a "cross" pattern: the center row and center column are filled with gray (5), and the remaining cells are white (0). If the input grid contains only zeros, the output grid will be all zeros.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program was too simplistic. It correctly identified the 3x3 output and the "cross" pattern, but it failed to account for variations in the position of the non-zero elements within the input grid. The core issue is that the current program always creates a cross centered at (1,1) in the output, regardless of the input's structure. The results reveal inconsistencies in the "cross" orientation; it appears to be aligned to the bottom and right, instead of always centered.

**Strategy:**
The natural language program must be adjusted to reflect that the position of the cross (or part of the cross) is variable and aligned to the edges of the output grid.

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**

Since there's no computation, I am skipping the code block.

**Example Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the discrepancies:

*   **Example 1:** Matches perfectly. The initial program works for this case.
*   **Example 2:** The output is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The "cross" is anchored in the top left.
*   **Example 3:** The "cross" section is in the bottom right corner, while the code creates cross in the center
*   **Example 4:** Matches perfectly.
*   **Example 5:** The "cross" section is in the bottom right corner
*   **Example 6:** The output is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
*   **Example 7:** The output is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: "e16e5b12"
  - input_grid_size: variable
  - output_grid_size: "3x3"
  - output_color_palette: [0, 5] # White and Gray
  - input_contains_non_zero: "Presence of non-zero values triggers the transformation."
  - output_pattern_if_non_zero: "A 'cross-like' or part of 'cross' shape using gray (5)."
  - output_pattern_position: "Anchored at edges of 3x3. Could be top-left, bottom right, bottom-left or top-right."
  - output_pattern_if_all_zero: "If the input grid is all zeros, the output grid is also all zeros."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** An input grid of arbitrary dimensions containing integer values from 0 to 9.
2.  **Output:** A 3x3 output grid.
3.  **Zero Check:** If all cells in the input grid are 0, the output grid is filled entirely with 0s (white).
4.  **Non-Zero Transformation:** If the input grid contains any non-zero values:
    *   The output grid will contain gray pixels that, together, create a cross or section of cross.
    *   The placement of the cross/cross section within output is anchored on an output edge.
    *    If the non-zero cells of input are in the top and left of the grid, the cross section is created in the top left of the output grid, i.e., the cells (0,1) (1,0) (1,1) are 5.
        *  If the non-zero cells of input are in the bottom and right of the grid, the cross section is created in the bottom right of the output grid, i.e. the cells (2,1) (1,2) (1,1) are 5.
5. All other output cells will be set to 0.
