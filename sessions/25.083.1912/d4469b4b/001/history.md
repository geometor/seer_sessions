Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs are rectangular grids of varying sizes, filled with single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   The outputs are smaller, rectangular grids, also filled with integers, seemingly derived from the input grids.
*   The output grids consistently use only '0' and '5', representing white and gray.
*   There's a noticeable reduction in dimensions from input to output. The output appears to capture some essence of the input in a condensed form.
*   The non-zero values in the input grid do not seem to be directly present in the output, it transforms into gray (5).
*   The position and arrangement of the input non-zero values seem to influence the output structure.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: fixed (3 x 3)
      - values: integers (0, 5)
  - relationship: input_to_output_size_reduction
    description: Output grid is consistently smaller than the input grid.
  - relationship: value_transformation
    description: Non-zero values in input grid are transformed to 5 (gray) in the output grid. Zero values remain unchanged or become 5.
  - action: pattern_extraction
    description: The output grid seems to extract a central pattern or "core" from the input grid.
  - observation: output_shape
    description: The output grid is always 3x3, filled with white(0) and gray(5).
  - observation: input_non_zero_effect
    description: Input grids containing non-zero numbers gives a "cross" pattern of gray(5) in the ouput grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Regions:** Examine the input grid and locate regions containing non-zero values.

2.  **Reduce to 3x3 output:** Reduce the pattern to a 3 x 3 grid, filled with 0 initially.

3.  **Fill Gray Cross:** if non-zero value were presents in input, set up a "cross" in the output, which composed of the center row and center column filled with 5. If there is no non-zero, returns all zeros 3 x 3 grid.
    *   The middle row is all gray (5).
    *   The middle column is all gray (5).
    *   Remaining cells stay white(0).

In summary, the transformation extracts a simplified representation, by creating a 3x3 "cross" pattern of gray pixels, if there is any non-zero values in input. It provides an abstraction of the presence and rough location of non-zero elements in the input.
