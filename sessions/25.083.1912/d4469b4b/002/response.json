            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was too simplistic. It correctly identified the 3x3 output and the \"cross\" pattern, but it failed to account for variations in the position of the non-zero elements within the input grid. The core issue is that the current program always creates a cross centered at (1,1) in the output, regardless of the input's structure. The results reveal inconsistencies in the \"cross\" orientation; it appears to be aligned to the bottom and right, instead of always centered.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe natural language program must be adjusted to reflect that the position of the cross (or part of the cross) is variable and aligned to the edges of the output grid.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**\n\nSince there's no computation, I am skipping the code block.\n\n**Example Analysis:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the discrepancies:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Matches perfectly. The initial program works for this case.\n*   **Example 2:** The output is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The \"cross\" is anchored in the top left.\n*   **Example 3:** The \"cross\" section is in the bottom right corner, while the code creates cross in the center\n*   **Example 4:** Matches perfectly.\n*   **Example 5:** The \"cross\" section is in the bottom right corner\n*   **Example 6:** The output is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n*   **Example 7:** The output is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
