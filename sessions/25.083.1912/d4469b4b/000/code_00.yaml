facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: fixed (3 x 3)
      - values: integers (0, 5)
  - relationship: input_to_output_size_reduction
    description: Output grid is consistently smaller than the input grid.
  - relationship: value_transformation
    description: Non-zero values in input grid are transformed to 5 (gray) in the output grid. Zero values remain unchanged or become 5.
  - action: pattern_extraction
    description: The output grid seems to extract a central pattern or "core" from the input grid.
  - observation: output_shape
    description: The output grid is always 3x3, filled with white(0) and gray(5).
  - observation: input_non_zero_effect
    description: Input grids containing non-zero numbers gives a "cross" pattern of gray(5) in the ouput grid.
