Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The code generally follows the initial natural language program, but there are consistent errors in the placement of the transformed slice within the output grid and handling of colors other than maroon. It identifies the blue vertical line and extracts a 3-column slice. It does replace maroon (9) with azure (8), but also sets other colors. The primary issue appears to be incorrect pixel placement and secondary condition on color substitution.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Pixel positioning**: Review and debug the code logic related to output grid
    population, the transformed slice needs to overwrite from 0, 1, 2.
2.  **Color Substitution:** Need to consider the additional constraint on which
    pixels to maintain.

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**

I need to confirm my assumptions by inspecting the grids, use this information
to refine the rules in the next phase

I will iterate through each example, printing relevant details about the
input, expected output, and actual output.
This will help to reveal issues in the natural language program.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: variable height and width

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: height matches input_grid, width is 3

  - name: blue_line
    type: object
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape: vertical line (all pixels in a column have the same color)
      - location: column index

  - name: slice
    type: object
    properties:
      - shape: 3 columns wide, height matches the height of blue_line
      - location: centered on blue_line (one column to the left, blue_line column, one column to the right)

actions:
  - name: find_blue_line
    input: input_grid
    output: blue_line location (column index)

  - name: define_slice
    input: blue_line location, input_grid dimensions
    output: slice boundaries (start and end column indices)

  - name: extract_slice
    input: input_grid, slice boundaries
    output: slice (3-column subgrid)

  - name: transform_slice
    input: slice
    actions:
      - replace maroon (9) with azure (8) where there is a vertical blue line in original grid
      - all other pixels are set to 0

  - name: create_output
    input: input_grid height
    output: output_grid (initialized with all white (0))

  - name: copy_slice_to_output
    input: transformed_slice, output_grid
    output: updated output_grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find the Vertical Blue Line:** Scan the input grid to locate a column that consists entirely of blue pixels (color code 1). This column is the "blue line". If no such line is found, the input is returned unchanged.
2.  **Define the Slice:** Create a three-column slice centered around the blue line. The slice includes the column to the left of the blue line, the blue line itself, and the column to the right of the blue line. The slice's height is the same as the input grid's height. Adjust slice boundaries if they exceed the input grid's dimensions (e.g., if the blue line is at the edge).
3. **Create output**: Initialize output grid which is the same height as the input grid with a width of 3, filled with white (0)
4.  **Extract Slice:** Extract the defined slice from the input grid.
5.  **Transform Slice:** Within the *extracted slice*,
    *   If there is a vertical blue line, replace any maroon (9) with azure (8)
    *   Set other pixels (not the blue line and not the replaced pixels) to white (0)
6.  **Populate Output:** Copy the *transformed slice* to the output grid starting at column 0.
