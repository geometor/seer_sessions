1.  **Find the Vertical Blue Line:** Scan the input grid to locate a column that consists entirely of blue pixels (color code 1). This column is the "blue line". If no such line is found, the input is returned unchanged.
2.  **Define the Slice:** Create a three-column slice centered around the blue line. The slice includes the column to the left of the blue line, the blue line itself, and the column to the right of the blue line. The slice's height is the same as the input grid's height. Adjust slice boundaries if they exceed the input grid's dimensions (e.g., if the blue line is at the edge).
3. **Create output**: Initialize output grid which is the same height as the input grid with a width of 3, filled with white (0)
4.  **Extract Slice:** Extract the defined slice from the input grid.
5.  **Transform Slice:** Within the *extracted slice*,
    *   If there is a vertical blue line, replace any maroon (9) with azure (8)
    *   Set other pixels (not the blue line and not the replaced pixels) to white (0)
6.  **Populate Output:** Copy the *transformed slice* to the output grid starting at column 0.
