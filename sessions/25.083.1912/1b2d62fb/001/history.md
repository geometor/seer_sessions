Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 2D array of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The dimensions vary between examples.
*   **Output Grid:** Another 2D array of single-digit integers, with different dimensions than the input. It appears to be a subset of information extracted from the input, with a color change.
*   **Consistent Element:** In all input grids, there's a vertical line of '1's (blue). This line seems crucial to the transformation.
*    **Color Change:** In all output, the value `9` in the input seems to change to `8` for the ouput.
* **Output Shape:** the output is always 3 columns wide, the height is variable and related to the input height.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: Contains a vertical line of '1's.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: Seems to be derived from the input grid, focusing on the area around the vertical line of '1's.
      - shape: always 3 columns
  - action: color_substitution
    description: '9' in the input becomes '8' in the output, other colors are kept as `0` in a 3 wide column window, centered on column `1`.
  - relationship:
    subject: output_grid
    predicate: is_derived_from
    object: input_grid
    details: The output grid extracts a 3-column slice around the vertical line of '1's in the input grid and perform the color substitution.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate:** Find the vertical line of '1's (blue) in the input grid.
2.  **Define Output Area**: construct the ouput from the columns to the immediate left and right of the vertical line, for a total of three columns.
3.  **Extract, Color Substitute and Copy**:
    *    every value of `9` on input becomes `8` on output
    *    copy the slice defined in step 2 to the output, performing the color substitution
    *    all other values become `0`

Essentially, the transformation isolates a three-column-wide section of the input grid, centered on the vertical blue line. Within this section, all '9's (maroon) are changed to '8's (azure), and every other value (other than the `1`s) are changed to '0' (white). The vertical blue line is discarded.
