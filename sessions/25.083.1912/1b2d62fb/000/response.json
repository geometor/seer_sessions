The dimensions vary between examples.\n*   **Output Grid:** Another 2D array of single-digit integers, with different dimensions than the input. It appears to be a subset of information extracted from the input, with a color change.\n*   **Consistent Element:** In all input grids, there's a vertical line of '1's (blue). This line seems crucial to the transformation.\n*    **Color Change:** In all output, the value `9` in the input seems to change to `8` for the ouput.\n* **Output Shape:** the output is always 3 columns wide, the height is variable and related to the input height.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
