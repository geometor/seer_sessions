            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, and it correctly identified the core concept: finding a vertical blue line, extracting a three-column slice around it, and performing color substitutions. However, the code doesn't accurately handle the color substitution and placement of the transformed slice within the output grid, leading to mismatches in most examples. The positioning of the output appears to be slightly incorrect. The slice needs to align to the right-hand-side.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Assumptions:** Double-check the initial assumptions about object identification (vertical blue line) and the transformation (3-column slice, color substitution).\n2.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Examine the pixel differences between the expected and transformed outputs. Identify patterns in the errors. Specifically note placement and values.\n3.  **Refine Color Substitution:** The current logic replaces *everything* other than maroon with white. It needs to be more nuanced.\n4.  **Adjust Slice Placement:** Investigate the copy operation. It seems there's an issue in how the transformed slice is being placed in the output.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**\n\nLet's compute detailed pixel differences to quantify the errors better. Since I am a text based agent. I do not have direct access to compute the pixel differences but will rely on the textual information.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

If no such line is found. Return the original grid unchanged.\n2.  **Define Slice Boundaries:** Calculate the start and end column indices for a three-column slice. The slice should include the column with the blue line, one column to its left, and one column to its right. Ensure the slice boundaries stay within the input grid's dimensions.\n3.  **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid with the same height as the input grid and a fixed width of 3.
