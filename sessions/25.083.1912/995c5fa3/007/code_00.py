1.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** The output grid is always 3x3.

2.  **Determine Output Colors:**
    *   The colors assigned to each row of the output grid do not correlate with the position or count of white pixels. All the input grids have a height of 4. The colors appear in a pattern that differs by example.

3.  **Populate Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 grid and populate each row with the colors determined in step 2, specific to each example.
