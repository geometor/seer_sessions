Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grids appear to be composed primarily of gray (5) and white (0) pixels. The output grids are smaller and consist of various colors (e.g., azure (8), red (2), yellow (4), green(3)). There seems to be a relationship between the positions of the white (0) pixels in the input and the generated colored pixels in the output. The gray pixels seem to acts a background and dont appear directly relevant. It seems that the white pixels might be grouped, and then the groups might be transformed/enumerated to make the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 4x14, 4x14)
      - colors: [gray, white]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x3, 3x3)
      - colors: [azure, red, yellow, green]
  - type: pixel_group
    properties:
       -color: white

actions:
  - name: group_white_pixels
    description: Identify contiguous groups of white pixels in the input grid.
  - name: transform_to_color
    description: Convert each white pixel group into a specific color in the output grid.
  - name: arrange_output
    description: arrange output colors in the same relative position as they appear in input

relationships:
  - input_grid_contains: pixel_groups
  - pixel_group_maps_to: output_pixel_color
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify White Pixel Groups:** Scan the input grid and identify contiguous groups of white (0) pixels. Contiguous means adjacent horizontally or vertically. Each distinct group of white pixels will later map to an colored pixel in the output.

2.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** The output grid's height is equal to the number of rows where white pixels occur in the input. The output grid's width is always 3.

3.  **Map and Transform:** Create a 3xN output grid, where N is the number of distinct rows from input that contain white pixels.

4.  **Assign a color:** Assign each row with white pixels in the input grid to a corresponding row in the output grid, starting with first row containing white pixels to the first row in the output grid.
    -   row 1 = 8 (azure) if white is present, 2(red) if not present
    -   row 2 = 2 (red), 4 (yellow), 3 (green)
    -   row 3 = 4 (yellow), 2(red)
    -   row 4 = 3 (green)

5. **Populate output:** all cells in a row in the output grid use the same color.
