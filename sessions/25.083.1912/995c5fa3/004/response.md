Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example and has several errors when applied to the other examples. The primary issue seems to be the color mapping and the conditions under which colors are assigned. The special case handling of `input_grid.shape == (4, 14)` seems overly specific and doesn't generalize. The core idea of identifying rows with white pixels is correct, but the logic for assigning colors to output rows based on the *order* of white-containing rows in the input needs correction. Also the order is wrong in almost all cases.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Color Mapping:** The current color mapping is incorrect and inconsistent across examples. We need to determine the *correct* mapping, possibly by considering the *number* of white pixels or other contextual clues within each row, not only index.
2.  **Generalize Conditions:** Remove the overly specific `(4, 14)` shape check. The rules should apply based on more general properties, like "all rows contain white" or "not all rows contain white," and the order/counts of white pixels within those rows.
3.  **Verify Row Ordering:** Ensure that the relationship between the input rows containing white and the output rows is correctly captured. It is not a simple 1:1 index mapping.

**Gather Metrics and Example Analysis:**

Let's use code execution to get some metrics.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input Rows with White:** Scan the input grid to identify all rows containing at least one white (0) pixel. Record the indices of these rows and the number of white pixels in each.

2.  **Determine Output Grid Size:**
    *   The output grid's width is always 3.
    *   The output grid's height is always 3.

3.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid of size 3x3, filled initially with zeros.

4.  **Map Colors to Output Rows:**
    * All examples have white pixels in every row.
    * Iterate through the *indices* of the rows that contain white pixels (which will always be 0, 1, 2, and 3 because every row contains at least one white pixel). The color assigned to each output row is determined by looking at all examples and seems to be consistent, and unrelated to the number of white pixels.:

    - Row with white index `0` corresponds to output row index 0.
    - Row with white index `1` corresponds to output row index 1.
    - Row with white index `2` corresponds to output row index 2.

    - output row 0 gets color 2 (red).
    - output row 1 gets color 8 (azure).
    - output row 2 gets color 3 (green).

5.  **Populate Output Rows:** For each output row, set all its cells to the mapped color.

Key Changes and Observations:

*   The output height is consistently 3, regardless of the number of input rows with white.
*   The `output_color_mapping` has been determined to be fixed, but the rationale is not in any of the provided data.
*   The white counts do not directly determine the output - the position is the determining factor.
