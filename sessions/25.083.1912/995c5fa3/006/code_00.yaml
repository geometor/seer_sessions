observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - height: varies (but is consistently 4 across provided examples)
      - width: varies
      - contains_white: True (all rows in all examples contain white pixels)

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - height: constant (3)
      - width: constant (3)
      - colors: vary, not directly related to the order of white pixels in the input
    transformation:
      - rule: "Output grid is always 3x3. The color of each output row appears to relate to the example number in some way.  Input grids all have the same height (4)"
