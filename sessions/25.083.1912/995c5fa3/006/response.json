            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of identifying rows with white pixels and mapping them to output rows with fixed colors was partially correct but flawed. While the output size (3x3) is consistently correct, and some examples use colors that are in the current color map, the mapping between input rows and output colors is incorrect and inconsistent across all examples. The initial assumption that the *order* of rows containing white pixels dictates the output color is wrong. There's a more complex relationship at play. It seems like the examples are actually selecting colors independent of the white pixels.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Discard White Pixel Focus:** The presence of white pixels seems to be a distractor. The core logic doesn't depend on *where* the white pixels are, or their count within a row. We need to shift our focus.\n2.  **Analyze Color Mapping Directly:** We must analyze the input-output pairs to discern a direct mapping between some characteristic of the *input* and the colors used in the *output*.\n3. **Consider input grid features:** Since the presence of white is universal and therefore not helpful, we should consider other features of the input grids, for example, size.\n4. **Re-examine Examples**: Look at the color mapping in *all* examples, looking for a different pattern.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution to verify claims):**\n\n"
