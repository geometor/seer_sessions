            "text": "Okay, here's an analysis of the situation and a plan to address the errors, along with the requested deliverables.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and generated code were based on the first training example. The errors encountered in subsequent examples reveal that the initial assumptions were too narrow and didn't account for variations in the input grids, specifically when approaching the boundaries (edges) of those grids.\n\nThe errors \"could not broadcast input array from shape (2,1) into shape (1,2)\" and similar indicate problems in the way subgrids are extracted and placed in the output, especially with the 1x2 and 2x1 subgrids instead of 2x2.\n\nThe core issue stems from how the code handles cases where a full 2x2 subgrid cannot be extracted because the yellow anchor point is too close to the edges of the input grid. The initial attempt to handle edge cases was insufficient, and it is producing dimension mismatches.\n\nThe strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Analyze each example:** Use code execution to inspect the input grids, focusing on the location of the yellow pixel and the dimensions of the input grid.\n2.  **Refine Subgrid Extraction:** Improve the logic for extracting subgrids, ensuring correct handling for all edge cases, including top, bottom, left and right boundaries. The original assumption about the yellow pixel always has enough pixels for 2x2 is incorrect, so the code must be more robust.\n3.  **Refine Placement Logic:** Ensure the placement of the (potentially rotated) subgrids into the output grid aligns with the dimensions of the subgrid.\n\n**Data Gathering and Metrics (using Code Execution)**\n\nI'll use a `tool_code` block to analyze each example input, focusing on the yellow pixel's location, the input grid dimensions, and the subgrid extraction dimensions.\n\n"
