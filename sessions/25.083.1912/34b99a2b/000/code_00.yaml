        properties:
          - "Variable dimensions."
          - "Common colors: 0, 8, 4, 5."
          - "Color 4 always located in the 5th column."
  - output_grids:
      - description: "2D arrays of digits, primarily 0 and 2."
        properties:
          - "Consistent 4 columns."
          - "Predominant colors: 0 and 2."

        details:
          - "Position of '2' in output seems related to specific pattern/object in input."
          - "The color 4 (yellow) acts like an anchor, and is transformed into
            the right most edge of the red (color 2) in the output"
