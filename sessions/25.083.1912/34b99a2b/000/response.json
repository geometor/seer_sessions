Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits, representing colors.\n*   The input grids have varying sizes, but seem to share common colors (0, 8, 4, 5).\n*    The output grids also share dimensions (4 columns)\n*   The output grids predominantly feature the color '2' (red) and '0' (white/background).\n*   There's a noticeable spatial relationship change between input and output. It seems like a specific pattern or object in the input determines the placement of '2's in the output.\n*   Color 4 (yellow) is always in the 5th column of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The number of rows is the same as in the input grid\n\n3.  **Populate with Red:** The output grid will be constructed with color red\n    (value 2) up to and including the \"anchor\" column from the input.\n\n4. **Remainder is background:** All other cells in the output should have a\n   value of 0 (color white or background).\n\nIn summary, The output grid takes on the number of rows from the input, and the\nnumber of columns is 4.
