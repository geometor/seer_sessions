            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to address the errors:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe errors \"could not broadcast input array from shape (x,y) into shape (a,b)\" indicate a shape mismatch during the subgrid placement phase. This happens when `output_grid[sub_r_start:sub_r_start + rotated_subgrid.shape[0], 0:rotated_subgrid.shape[1]] = rotated_subgrid` tries to assign a `rotated_subgrid` of one shape into a slice of `output_grid` that has a different, incompatible shape. The errors show this is consistently happening and the shape (2,1) is being assigned to shape (1,1). This seems to indicate that the subgrids in all the examples provided is a 2x1 array and the row the yellow pixel is found is always r, not r and r+1.\n\nMy strategy is as follows:\n\n1.  **Inspect all examples:** I need to examine *all* the training input/output pairs, not just rely on the error messages from the initial code. I'll use a `tool_code` block to print the shapes of the input grids, locate the yellow pixels, and determine the dimensions of the extracted subgrids.\n2.  **Analyze Placement Logic:** I'll carefully re-examine the placement logic in the natural language program and the corresponding code. The goal is to understand precisely *why* the shapes are mismatched. It is likely that the row placement needs to be changed from `sub_r_start:sub_r_start + rotated_subgrid.shape[0]` to `r:r + 1`.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed analysis, I'll rewrite the natural language program to correctly describe the subgrid extraction, rotation (if any), and *precise* placement rules. I will be extra cautious about edge cases.\n4.  **Update Code:** I will use this analysis and adjust the code.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**\n\n"
