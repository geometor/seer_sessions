The output grid appears to be a condensed version of the input grid, specifically focusing on the rightmost two columns.  The shapes and colors in the input are somewhat maintained in the output but are cropped/extracted. The empty space (0, or white) seems to remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
