Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on discerning the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 2D grid. The output grid appears to be a condensed version of the input grid, specifically focusing on the rightmost two columns.  The shapes and colors in the input are somewhat maintained in the output but are cropped/extracted. The empty space (0, or white) seems to remain unchanged.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9)
      properties:
        - height: variable
        - width: variable
        - color: determined by integer value

  - columns:
      type: sub-section of grid
      properties:
        - position: relative to grid (rightmost)
        - count: two
        - content: integers

transformations:
  - extraction:
      input: rightmost two columns of the input grid
      output: new grid
      details: maintains relative positions of pixels from the selected columns

relationships:
   - input grid contains columns
   - output grid is composed of extracted columns

invariants:
   - zeros (white space) is consistent between the input and output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify**: Locate the two rightmost columns in the input grid.
2.  **Extract**: Create a new grid consisting of the two rightmost columns as the input grid's, preserving their original vertical order and cell values, i.e. colors.
3.   The new, generated, grid has as height the height of the input grid.
4.  **Output**: Return the new grid which represents a cropped section of the original input grid.

Essentially, the transformation is a simple extraction of the two rightmost columns of the input grid, presented as the output grid.
