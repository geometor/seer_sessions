Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program was too simplistic. It assumed the transformation was simply extracting the last two columns. The results show this is incorrect. The transformed output has the correct dimensions, but the pixel values are wrong in most cases. This indicates a misunderstanding of the relationship between the input and output grids. The order of columns in the output appears to be flipped compared to a simple copy, and the pixel values are not a direct map.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Column Order:** Investigate if the output columns are a reordered version of the last two input columns (e.g., swapped).
2.  **Pixel Mapping:** Determine the relationship between the pixel values in the input and output. It's unlikely to be a simple substitution cipher across the entire color range. It is more likely the mapping rule will be based on relative position, and/or localized to color.
3.  **Object Recognition**: Attempt to understand if the task involves recognizing and transforming shapes, rather than applying a generic rule to all columns.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's use code execution to analyze color distributions and column swapping. We will start by loading the data.

Okay, straight column swapping is also ruled out. It's clear that the program misinterprets some key aspect of the transformation. Let's revisit the expected outputs provided and compare the last two columns of the input with the expected output, looking for a pattern in how individual pixel values change.

**Example 1:**

Input last two columns:


```
8 6
8 8
0 0
5 5
4 4
0 0
3 3
3 7
```


Expected Output:


```
6 8
8 8
0 0
5 4
5 4
0 0
3 8
7 3
```


Observations:

*   The `8`s in the first column become `6` or remain `8`.
*   The top `6` becomes an `8`.
*    `5` stays the same
*   `4` stays the same
* `3` maps to `8` or to itself
* `7` becomes `3`
**Example 2:**

Input last two columns:


```
2 4
2 4
0 0
3 3
2 2
0 0
8 3
8 3
0 0
9 9
7 9
```


Expected Output:


```
4 2
4 2
0 0
3 3
3 2
0 0
3 8
3 8
0 0
9 9
9 7
```


Observations:

*   The `2`s in the first column all become `4`. The `2`s in the second column remain `2`
*    The `3`s either stay or move
*    The bottom `9` becomes a `7`

Let's create the facts and the natural language program

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
  - name: columns
    type: list
    description: the last two columns of the input grid

properties:
  - name: width
    type: integer
    object: input_grid
    description: The number of columns in the grid.
  - name: height
    type: integer
    object: input_grid
    description: The number of rows in the grid.
 - name: last_two_columns
    type: subgrid
    object: input_grid
    description: select the last two columns

actions:
  - name: extract
    description: Select the two rightmost columns of the input grid.
  - name: create output
    description: Use a mapping based on position to create the output columns
  - name: swap
    description: swap columns within the output

mapping_rules:
    example_1:
        8: [6, 8] # First column 8 -> 6, second column 8 -> 8
        6: [8] # First column -> second
        5: [5]
        4: [4]
        3: [3,8]
        7: [3]
        0: [0]
    example_2:
      2: [4, 2] # First column: 2 -> 4. Second Column: 2 -> 2
      3: [3, 3]
      0: [0]
      8: [3]
      9: [9, 7] # First Column: 9-> 9 Second: -> 7
      7: [9]

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Extract:** Select the last two columns of the input grid.
2.  **Create Output:** Create an output grid with the same number of rows as the input grid and two columns.
3. **Mapping Rules:** Use the mapping rules derived from each of the examples. Apply the rule by looking up the original number in each column and finding its mapping.
4.  The new columns are created from these rules
