The core issue is that the `mapping_rules` dictionary is incomplete and contains errors, especially revealed in Example 2. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine where the transformed output deviates from the expected output in *both* examples. This will pinpoint the incorrect or missing mapping rules.\n2.  **Refine Mapping Rules:** Correct the `mapping_rules` based on *all* available examples. The rules must consistently transform the input to the output. No default mapping is needed, as there is always a mapping.\n3.  **Re-evaluate:** After updating the rules, conceptually re-run the transformation to ensure the logic is sound.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a more detailed look at each example, focusing on identifying correct/incorrect mappings:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    *   Input Columns: `8 6`, `8 8`, `0 0`, `5 5`, `4 4`, `0 0`, `3 3`, `3 7`\n    *   Expected Output: `6 8`, `8 8`, `0 0`, `4 5`, `4 5`, `0 0`, `8 8`, `8 3`\n    *   Transformed Output: `3 8`, `3 8`, `0 0`, `5 5`, `4 4`, `0 0`, `8 3`, `8 9`\n    *   Mismatches and Inferred Rules:\n        *   `8 6` -> `3 8` (Incorrect: First col 8 should map to 3, and 6 should be mapped to 8)\n        *   `8 8` -> `3 8` (Incorrect: First col 8 should map to 3.)\n        *   `5 5` -> `5 5`\n        *   `4 4` -> `4 4` (Pixel Off)\n        *   `3 3` -> `8 3` (Pixel Off)\n        *   `3 7` -> `8 9` (Partially correct/incorrect)\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    *   Input Columns: `2 4`, `2 4`, `0 0`, `3 3`, `2 2`, `0 0`, `8 3`, `8 3`, `0 0`, `9 9`, `7 9`\n    *   Expected Output: `5 8`, `5 8`, `0 0`, `2 3`, `2 3`, `0 0`, `3 3`, `8 8`, `0 0`, `9 9`, `9 7`\n    *   Transformed output: `4 4`, `4 4`, `0 0`, `8 3`, `4 2`, `0 0`, `3 3`, `3 3`, `0 0`, `9 7`, `3 7`\n    *   Mismatches and Inferred rules:\n        *   `2 4` -> `4 4`  Incorrect: The first col should map to 4, and the second col should be mapped to 2\n        *   `3 3` -> `8, 3`: Incorrect First col should map to 3.\n        *    `2 2` -> `4 2`: The first col should map to 4.\n        *    `8 3` -> `3 3`:\n        *    `9 9` ->`9 7`:\n        *    `7 9` -> `3 7`:\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
