Here's a breakdown of the results, analysis, and updated natural language program:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code, while conceptually on the right track by extracting the two rightmost columns, fails to accurately remap the pixel values in both examples. The core issue is that the `mapping_rules` dictionary is incomplete and contains errors, especially revealed in Example 2. The strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine where the transformed output deviates from the expected output in *both* examples. This will pinpoint the incorrect or missing mapping rules.
2.  **Refine Mapping Rules:** Correct the `mapping_rules` based on *all* available examples. The rules must consistently transform the input to the output. No default mapping is needed, as there is always a mapping.
3.  **Re-evaluate:** After updating the rules, conceptually re-run the transformation to ensure the logic is sound.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a more detailed look at each example, focusing on identifying correct/incorrect mappings:

*   **Example 1:**

    *   Input Columns: `8 6`, `8 8`, `0 0`, `5 5`, `4 4`, `0 0`, `3 3`, `3 7`
    *   Expected Output: `6 8`, `8 8`, `0 0`, `4 5`, `4 5`, `0 0`, `8 8`, `8 3`
    *   Transformed Output: `3 8`, `3 8`, `0 0`, `5 5`, `4 4`, `0 0`, `8 3`, `8 9`
    *   Mismatches and Inferred Rules:
        *   `8 6` -> `3 8` (Incorrect: First col 8 should map to 3, and 6 should be mapped to 8)
        *   `8 8` -> `3 8` (Incorrect: First col 8 should map to 3.)
        *   `5 5` -> `5 5`
        *   `4 4` -> `4 4` (Pixel Off)
        *   `3 3` -> `8 3` (Pixel Off)
        *   `3 7` -> `8 9` (Partially correct/incorrect)
*   **Example 2:**

    *   Input Columns: `2 4`, `2 4`, `0 0`, `3 3`, `2 2`, `0 0`, `8 3`, `8 3`, `0 0`, `9 9`, `7 9`
    *   Expected Output: `5 8`, `5 8`, `0 0`, `2 3`, `2 3`, `0 0`, `3 3`, `8 8`, `0 0`, `9 9`, `9 7`
    *   Transformed output: `4 4`, `4 4`, `0 0`, `8 3`, `4 2`, `0 0`, `3 3`, `3 3`, `0 0`, `9 7`, `3 7`
    *   Mismatches and Inferred rules:
        *   `2 4` -> `4 4`  Incorrect: The first col should map to 4, and the second col should be mapped to 2
        *   `3 3` -> `8, 3`: Incorrect First col should map to 3.
        *    `2 2` -> `4 2`: The first col should map to 4.
        *    `8 3` -> `3 3`:
        *    `9 9` ->`9 7`:
        *    `7 9` -> `3 7`:

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Extract:** Take the two rightmost columns from the input grid.
2.  **Remap:** Transform these two columns to create the output grid. The transformation rule depends on the **original pixel value** AND its **column index** (0 for the leftmost of the two, 1 for the rightmost). Apply this mapping:
    *   If the original value is 0: The new value is 0, regardless of column.
    *   If the original value is 2:
        If it is in column 0, it maps to 4.
        If it is in column 1, it maps to 2.

    *   If the original value is 3:

         If it is in column 0, it maps to 8.

         If it is in column 1, it maps to 3.

    *    If the original value is 4:
         The output is always 4

    *   If the original value is 5:
         The output is always 5

    *   If the original value is 6:
        If it is in column 0, it maps to 3.
        If it is in column 1, it maps to 8.

    *   If original value is 7:
         If it is in column 0, it maps to 9.

         If it is in column 1, it maps to 7.

    *   If the original value is 8:

         If it is in column 0, it maps to 3.

         If it is in column 1, it maps to 8.

    *   If the original value is 9:

         If it is in column 0, it maps to 9.

         If it is in column 1, it maps to 7.
