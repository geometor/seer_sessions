      - color: integer value (1-9)

  - name: frame
    description: A rectangle of the seed_color along the edges of the grid.
    properties:
        - color: seed_pixel.color

  - name: inner_pixels

    properties:
        - color:  0 or seed_pixel.color

actions:
  - name: find_seed
    description: Locate the non-zero pixel in the input grid.

  - name: draw_frame
    description: Set the perimeter of the output grid to the seed pixel's color.

  - name:  fill_inner_pixels
    description:  set non-frame pixels to 0 or the seed color
        - set the seed_pixel in the output grid to 0
        - set pixels adjacent to the seed pixel to 0
        - set the remaining inner pixels to the same color as the seed pixel
