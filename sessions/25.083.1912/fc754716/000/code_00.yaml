facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain a single non-zero pixel, acting as a "seed".
  - observation: |
      Output grids maintain the original dimensions of the input grids.
  - observation: |
     The single non-zero pixel is replaced by the value `0`.
  - observation: |
      Output grids have a rectangular frame of the seed color, one pixel thick, filling the outer edges.
  - observation: |
      The seed color's location is always on the center of the frame.
  - observation: |
      All the `0` in the original input are replaced by the seed color except the immediate neighbors of the `0` replacing the original seed color.
  - object: Seed pixel
    properties:
      color: Non-zero value in the input grid.
      location: Center of the input grid.
    actions:
      - Replaced by '0'.
  - object: Output frame
    properties:
      color: Same as the seed pixel's original color.
      shape: Rectangular, one pixel thick.
      size: Matches the dimensions of the input grid.
    actions:
      - Fills the entire outer edge of the output grid.
