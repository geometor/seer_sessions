            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were partially correct. It correctly identified the interaction between green (3) and red (2) pixels and the change of green to azure (8). However, it failed to correctly and consistently change the red (2) pixels to black (0) in all cases, as evidenced by Example 3. The strategy to resolve this involves revisiting the logic that handles the red pixel transformation. It seems the original approach attempted to change red pixels in a separate loop after processing green pixels. This has proven to be not robust, leading to incorrect results.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe core issue is the order of operations and handling of state changes. We need to change both the green AND the red pixels within the *same* iteration, not sequentially in two separate passes, since red pixels only need to be changed if an *adjacent* green pixel changes. The previous approach had a flaw that prevents all appropriate red cells from being changed. It will be better to make the changes to both the green and red pixels at the same time.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using visual inspection, since tool use not necessary for simple counts):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 6x7 grid\n    *   Output: 6x7 grid\n    *   Transformation: Correct.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid\n    *   Output: 3x3 grid\n    *   Transformation: Correct.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 7x7 grid\n    *   Output: 7x7 grid\n    *   Transformation: **Incorrect**. Two red pixels that should have been changed to black were not. This is also a case where a green pixel changed to azure is adjacent to other green pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If any of the adjacent pixels is red (2), change the current green pixel to azure (8) and the red pixel to black (0).\n4. If the current pixel is *not* green, it is unchanged.\n5.
