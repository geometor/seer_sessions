facts:
  - observation: Input grids are rectangular and consist of alternating red (2) and white (0) pixels.
  - observation: Input grids have two rows and variable number of columns.
  - observation: Output grids are rectangular, taller, and have 7 columns.
  - observation: Output grids contain white (0), red (2), and green (3) pixels.
  - observation: The top-left pixel of the output grid is always white (0).
  - observation: The output grid always has a single green (3) pixel in the top row, fourth position.
  - observation: The red (2) pixels in the output grid form a vertical pattern, expanding downwards from positions that align with some red pixels in the input.
  - observation: The number of red shapes are related to the size of the input.
  - relation: The output height changes between examples.
  - relation: The placement of the single '3' pixel in the first row is consistent.
