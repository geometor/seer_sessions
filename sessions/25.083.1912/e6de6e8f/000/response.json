            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a rectangular grid of colored pixels (represented by digits) into another grid of different dimensions and color arrangements. The input grids consistently show a pattern of alternating red (2) and white/blank (0) pixels. The output grids exhibit more complexity, with larger dimensions, the introduction of green (3) pixels, and varying arrangements of red (2) pixels. It's noticeable the the upper left corner is always zero and the upper 3 is always present. There seems to be an expansion of the original grid, with strategic placement of '2's and a single '3'.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
