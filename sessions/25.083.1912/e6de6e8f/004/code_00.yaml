objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - height: variable (4 in all examples)
      - width: variable (9, 8, 7 in examples)
      - colors: contains 0 (white) and 2 (red)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - height: variable, depends on input, formula: output_height = input_width * 2 - (input_width - x_last_red) + 1 - 3, where x_last_red is the rightmost red pixel's x-coordinate in input
      - width: constant (7)
      - colors: contains 0 (white), 2 (red), and 3 (green)
  - name: red_stripe
    type: object
    properties:
      - color: 2 (red)
      - shape: vertical line
      - x_position: same as red pixels in input_grid
      - start_y: 3
      - end_y: varies, needs recalculation
  - name: green_pixel
    type: object
    properties:
      - color: 3 (green)
      - position: (0, 3) # row 0, column 3

  - name: place_green_pixel
    description: Places a single green pixel at a fixed position.
  - name: place_red_stripes
    description: Places vertical red stripes based on the x-coordinates of red pixels in the input grid, but height calculation is incorrect.
