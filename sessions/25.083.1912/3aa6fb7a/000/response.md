Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary focus seems to be on the interaction or modification of specific colored objects within the grid, particularly involving color '8' (azure) and the introduction of color '1' (blue). The size of the grid remains constant between input and output.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - object_types:
      - type: azure_objects
        color: 8
        description: Contiguous blocks of '8' pixels.
      - type: blue_insertions
        color: 1
        description: Single '1' pixels appearing in the output grid.
  - relationships:
      - relation: adjacency
        description: '1' pixels are placed adjacent to '8' pixels.
      - relation: spatial
        description: The relative positions of '8' pixels remain mostly consistent between input and output.
  - actions:
      - action: insertion
        description:  '1' (blue) pixels are inserted into the grid.
        rule: |
            Insert a '1' to the left of an azure object if there is a '0'.
            Insert a '1' above an azure object if there is a '0'.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify**: Locate all azure (8) colored objects within the input grid.
2.  **Check Left**: For each azure object, moving left to right, and top to bottom, check the cell immediately to its left.
3. **Insert (Left)**: If the cell to the left is a '0', change it to a '1'.
4.  **Check Above**: Then for each azure object, check the cell immediately above it.
5. **Insert (Above):** If the cell above is a '0', change it to '1'.
6.  **Preserve**: All other cells in the grid remain unchanged.

Essentially, the transformation rule inserts blue (1) pixels to the immediate left, and above of existing azure (8) colored objects, provided those positions were previously occupied by white pixels (0).
