facts:
  - observation: All input grids have dimensions 8x8.
  - observation: All output grids have dimensions 3x6.
  - observation: Output grids seem to be a condensed representation of the input grids.
  - observation: "Every other" row and column selection is a recurring theme, but needs precise definition.
  - observation: Non-zero values in the input are the primary components of the output.
  - observation: Example 1 contains the color 2 (red).
