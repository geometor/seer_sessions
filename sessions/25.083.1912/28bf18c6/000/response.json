It is not a simple rotation.\n*   **Color Preservation:** While the positions change, the colors present in the input generally appear in the output.\n*   **Output Size:** The output grid is smaller than the input grid in all examples. It appears to be roughly half the height and width, skipping every other row and column. It is selecting some subset of the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Fill the output grid starting from the top-left.\n\nAnother simpler, alternate version, that describes the same actions\n\n1.
