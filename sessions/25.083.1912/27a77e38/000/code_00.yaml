facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Most rows remain unchanged.
  - observation: Changes are isolated to the last row.
  - observation: A single pixel on the last row becomes non-zero; others stay zero.
  - target_pixel: The non-zero pixel's color on the last row in the output.
  - hypothesis: Find the same color pixel in rows above on input.
  - location: if input width is odd then non-zero pixel is at `width // 2`, else it is at or near `width // 2`.
