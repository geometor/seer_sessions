            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple observation from the first example, assuming that the output grid's structure is directly derived from the first row of the input, pulling color blocks separated by zeros. However, the subsequent examples reveal inconsistencies with this assumption. The sizes and content of the output grids don't always match the widths of the color blocks in the first row. Some examples suggest a relationship to additional rows. The current approach frequently produces incorrect output sizes and inaccurate pixel arrangements. The key issue is relying *solely* on the first row and ignoring the information of the other input rows.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze All Rows:** We need to examine all rows of the input grid, not just the first one, to determine the output's structure and content. It is highly probable that the arrangement of the colored blocks throughout the entire input is the source of truth for how to construct the output.\n\n2.  **Re-evaluate Width Determination:** The current width calculation, based on the first row's color blocks, is flawed. We need to find another way to determine the correct output width that considers the entire grid and the other rows. It looks like there may be a relationship of the output width and the input width.\n\n3.  **Re-evaluate Height Determination:** The current approach hard codes the height to 3. Based on the test cases, this appears to be a constant.\n\n4. **Improve the natural language program**: rewrite it to be more concise and\n   precise.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using Code Execution):**\n\nI'll use a code block to gather some metrics and then create the YAML & Natural Language Program.\n\n"
