Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger rectangular grid (input) into a smaller rectangular grid (output). The input grids appear to be divided into roughly four quadrants or sections by a '0' (white) border, and two of the quadrants are filled, while two are not, and contain only white.
The transformation seems to select one of the colored blocks, preserve it, transpose it, and stack it with the alternating colored blocks with 0 (white) in betweeen. The output grid consistently has a height of 3 and removes the '0' (white) separators columns and rows, keeping only the relevant colored blocks.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        - dimensions: variable (MxN)
        - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
        - structure: appears sectioned, possibly by '0' values
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        - dimensions: fixed height (3) x variable width
        - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
        - structure: derived from a selection and combination of colors from different regions of the input_grid

actions:
  - selection:
      description: Identifying and extracting specific color blocks from the input_grid.
  - combination: putting alternating colors with white, in rows.

relationships:
  - input_output_size: output_grid is smaller than input_grid
  - element_correspondence: colors in output_grid are present in input_grid
  - transformation_rule: colors are extracted, with rows of white in between.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Blocks:** Examine the input grid. Note the distinct colored blocks separated/surrounded by '0' (white) pixels.
2.  **Get First Column and Transpose:** Get the first occurring color block. Transpose to fit in three rows.
3.  **Stack Alternating Colors with White:** In order, add a row of the transposed color, add a row of '0', and repeat for the remaining colors found.
