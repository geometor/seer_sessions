observations:
  - object: color_block
    description: Contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels with the same non-zero color.
    properties:
      color: Integer value (1-9) representing the color.
      length: Number of pixels in the block.
      start_position: (row, col) index of the first pixel in the block.

  - object: input_grid
    description: 2D array of color values.
    properties:
      height: Number of rows.
      width: Number of columns.

  - object: output_grid
    description: 2D array of color values, always with a height of 3.
    properties:
      height: Always 3.
      width: Varies, seems related to most common input block length, but not always equal.

transformations:
  - action: identify_blocks
    description: Find all color blocks in each row of the input grid.

  - action: determine_output_width
    description: Determine the output grid's width. Related to the most frequent block length in the input, but needs clarification. It IS NOT simply the most common block length in all cases.
    
  - action: populate_output_rows
    description:  Fill the output grid rows.  The first row seems to use a block from input, and so does the second. The third row is filled with zeros. The logic to select which blocks is unclear.

  - action: select_output_blocks
    description: Selects blocks of a specific width to use in constructing the output rows, handling partial/incomplete blocks.
