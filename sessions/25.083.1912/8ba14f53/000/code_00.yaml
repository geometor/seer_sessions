objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        - dimensions: variable (MxN)
        - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
        - structure: appears sectioned, possibly by '0' values
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        - dimensions: fixed height (3) x variable width
        - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
        - structure: derived from a selection and combination of colors from different regions of the input_grid

actions:
  - selection:
      description: Identifying and extracting specific color blocks from the input_grid.
  - combination: putting alternating colors with white, in rows.

relationships:
  - input_output_size: output_grid is smaller than input_grid
  - element_correspondence: colors in output_grid are present in input_grid
  - transformation_rule: colors are extracted, with rows of white in between.
