facts:
  - task: "Extract alternating color blocks and represent them in a condensed format."
  - input_grid:
    - property: "2D array of integers (0-9)"
    - property: "Represents colors in a grid"
  - output_grid:
    - property: "2D array of integers (0-9)"
    - property: "3 rows always"
    - property: "Width is determined by the longest continuous horizontal block of a single color, bordered by '0's"
  - objects:
    - name: "Color Block"
      - property: "Contiguous horizontal sequence of the same non-zero color, surrounded by zeros or the edge of input"
      - action: "Extracted from the input grid"
      - action: "Used to determine output width and content of a row"
    - name: "Zero Row"
      - property: "Row filled with zeros (0)"
      - action: "Inserted between color block rows in output"
  - transformation:
    - step: "Identify the distinct color blocks in the input grid's first row"
    - step: "Find the width of each color block"
    - step: "The output grid always contains 3 rows"
    - step: "Output row 1 is filled with color block 1"
    - step: "Output row 2 is filled with color block 2"
    - step: "Output row 3 is filled with all 0"
