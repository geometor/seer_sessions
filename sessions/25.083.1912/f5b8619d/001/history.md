Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input grids are smaller than the output grids.
*   The output grids appear to be an expansion of the input grids.
*   The input grids contain a few non-zero pixels, while the rest are zero (white).
*   The non-zero pixels in the input grid seem to be "seeds" for changes in the output grid.
*   The output grid uses '8' (azure) where there are only 0's.
*   There appears to be a pattern involving creating a 2x2 square made of the value in original grid in output grid and filling surrounding 8's.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: Contains seed pixels for transformation.
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: Expanded version of the input grid, with added '8' (azure) pixels.
  - relationship: expansion
    description: The output grid is an expanded version of the input grid with the multiple calculated by taking the shape and multiplying height and width by (input.height * 2, input.width * 3)
  - action: fill
    description: '8' (azure) pixels are filled in where the original grid are '0' (white). The non-zero value in input creates 2x2 block.
  - pattern: two_by_two
    description: Non zero pixels are present in 2x2 blocks in output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is larger than the input grid. The new dimensions are (input.height \* 2, input.width \* 3).
2.  **Expansion and Filling:** For each pixel in the input grid.
    *   If the input is a non-zero color, create 2x2 square in the output, starting at position (row\*2, col\*3).
    *   If the input pixel is '0' (white), leave corresponding block empty.
3. **Filling the gaps:** Iterate through new grid and if a value is 0 replace it by 8.
