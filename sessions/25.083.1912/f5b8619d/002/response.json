            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improving the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were based on a limited understanding of the transformation, primarily derived from the first training example. The subsequent tests reveal inconsistencies and errors, especially in how the expansion and filling of the output grid are handled. The core issues are:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Expansion Logic:** The code expands non-zero pixels into 2x2 blocks, but it doesn't correctly position these blocks within the output grid, leading to incorrect dimensions and misplaced pixels. Specifically the expansion should result in non-overlapping blocks, but current rule results in overlap.\n2.  **Incorrect Filling Logic:** The code intends to fill the remaining areas with '8' (azure), but seems to be misinterpreting the checkerboard and expansion rule. This is dependent on a correct expansion.\n3. **Size mismatch**: The output grid sizes do not match the expected sizes.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Revisit Expansion:** We need to carefully analyze how each input pixel's position maps to the output grid's blocks. The expansion factors (2x in height and 3x in width initially, but this could be wrong) need to be verified and the block placement logic corrected. It seems there is an issue with the horizontal placement as well.\n2.  **Revisit Filling:** Once expansion is correct, the filling logic needs to be revisited. The goal is likely a checkerboard or similar patterned fill of the remaining cells.\n3. **Iterative testing**: Apply changes and test against all provided examples after each change.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's gather some metrics using `numpy` to get a more precise understanding of the discrepancies.\n\n"
