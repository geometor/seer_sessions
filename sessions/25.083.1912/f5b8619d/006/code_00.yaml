facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: twice the input_grid dimensions (height * 2, width * 2)
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - action: expand_pixels
    description: Each pixel in input_grid is potentially transformed into a 2x2 block in output_grid.
    details:
      - Non-zero pixels are involved.
      - Zero pixels also have a transformation rule, that is not simply replacement.

  - action: fill_pixels
    description: The transformation takes place in a 2x2 grid, some cells of which will have the same color, other cells will be value 8.

  - pattern: output_grid shows a checkboard
    details: the checkboard is created from the pixels of input_grid, and azure (8).
