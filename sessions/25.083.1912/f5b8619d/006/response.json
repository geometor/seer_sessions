            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of doubling the dimensions and expanding non-zero pixels into 2x2 blocks was partially correct. However, the filling of remaining cells with '8' (azure) is not universally accurate. The placement and repetition of the original non-zero pixels is also incorrect. It looks like a pattern of 2x2 expansion and alternating fill is needed, but the existing logic isn't handling the interleaving correctly. The strategy should be to revise the pixel expansion and filling logic to properly interleave expanded pixels and fill pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's break down each example and pinpoint specific issues.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Output Shape: (12, 12)\n    *   Issue: Incorrect expansion of the '5' (gray) pixels. They appear as solid 2x2 blocks without the azure interleaving. Also looks like expansion is happening, incorrectly, even on zero value inputs.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Issue: Similar to Example 1, the '2' (red) pixels expand into 2x2 blocks, but the surrounding '8' (azure) filling isn't interleaved correctly. Also the zeros are not handled correctly.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *    Issue: Zero expansion and incorrect interleaving.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
