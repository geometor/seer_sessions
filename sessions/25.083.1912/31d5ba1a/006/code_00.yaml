    description: >-
      Maroon and yellow pixels in the input_grid are considered for translation.  Their
      row coordinate is divided by 2 (integer division). The column coordinate stays the same.
      If the translated position in the *expected output* is magenta, the corresponding pixel in the
      output_grid is set to magenta. Otherwise it is set to white.
