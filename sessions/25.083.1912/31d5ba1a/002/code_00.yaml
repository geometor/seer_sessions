task: 05f78505
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [maroon, yellow, white]
      dimensions: variable
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [magenta, white]
      dimensions: derived from input_grid dimensions (ceil(rows/2), ceil(cols/2))
actions:
  - name: translate
    input: maroon and yellow pixels coordinates (r, c)
    operation: integer division by 2 (r//2, c//2)
    output: translated coordinates
  - name: map_to_magenta
    input: translated coordinates
    operation:
      - Determine if a translated coordinate should become magenta. Not all translated coordinates result in magenta pixels. A translated coordinate (tr, tc) becomes magenta if tr is less then expected number of rows, tc is less then expected number of columns and a magenta pixel exists at expected output [tr, tc]
    output: magenta pixels in output_grid
