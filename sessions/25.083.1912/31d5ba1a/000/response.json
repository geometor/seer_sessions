The colors in the input grid seem to be specific to maroon (9), white(0), and yellow(4). The output grid consistently uses magenta (6) and white (0). There's a clear reduction in size from input to output. The specific positions of the maroons and yellows in the input seem to dictate the placement of magentas in the output. The relationship isn't a one-to-one mapping of colors, but rather a spatial relationship or pattern.\n\n**YAML Block of Facts:**\n\n"

X-coordinate increases to the right, and Y-coordinate increases downwards.\n\n3.  **Translate and Combine coordinates:** For each target pixel (maroon or yellow): record x and y coordinates. Take the original X, Y coordinate pairs, and create a new set of pairs by using integer division by two `// 2`. This compresses into half the values\n\n4. **Build Output Grid:** Create a new, smaller output grid. The dimensions of the new grid are approximately input grid original height and width integer divided by 2.\n\n5.  **Populate Output Grid:** Iterate through the translated coordinate pairs. For each unique (x, y) pair from step 3, set the pixel at the corresponding (x, y) location in the *output* grid to magenta (6).\n\n6. **Fill Remaining Pixels:** Any remaining pixels in the output grid that were not set to magenta in the previous step should be set to white (0).\n"
