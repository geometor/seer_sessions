Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 vertical and horizontal rectangles.
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells.
      shape: Background

output_grid:
    objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 vertical and horizontal rectangles.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: Two 1x1 squares.
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells.
      shape: Background
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid. In this case, there are two separate azure objects.

2.  **Change corner to blue**: If a corner piece of the object exists, change it to blue.

3.  **Preserve Other Azure Cells:** All other azure cells that are not corner cells remain unchanged.

4. **Preserve background**: All white cells remain unchanged.

**Natural Language Program**
```
1. Find all separate azure (color 8) objects.
2. Locate the corner cells of the identified regions.
3. For each corner cell, change its color to blue (color 1).
4. Keep all other cells, both other azure colored and all the background, the same color.
```

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
