Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Description of Input Grid**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: 8 (azure)
    positions:
      - [0, 4]
      - [0, 5]
      - [1, 5]
      - [2, 2]
      - [3, 2]
      - [3, 3]
      - [5, 4]
      - [6, 4]
      - [6, 3]
    shape: "Three separate azure colored components. One is a 2x1 horizontal shape. Another component is L shaped composed by 3 pixels. The last one is an inverted L shape."
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** The input grid contains three distinct azure (color 8) objects.

2.  **Change to Blue the Top-Right Pixel of Azure Objects:** It seems that the input changed to blue (color 1) the top-right pixel of each separated object.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule is the same as the previous example: Find every separated figure colored in azure. Find the top-right pixel of this object. Convert this pixel to blue.

The provided Python code should correctly transform the input to the output following the discovered rule.
