Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Input Grid**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: 8 (azure)
    positions:
      - [1, 1]
      - [2, 1]
      - [2, 2]
      - [3, 4]
      - [3, 5]
      - [4, 5]
    shape: "Two separate azure colored components. One is a 2x1 vertical shape next to another 1x1 square (or another 2x1 vertical shape, when considering it next to the square). Another component is a shape with two azure colored pixels placed one above the other making a 2x1 vertical line."

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** The input grid contains two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is on the left made of 3 pixels. One is on the right made of 3 pixels.

2.  **Change to Blue the Top-Right Pixel of Azure Objects:**
    It seems that the input changed to blue (color 1) the top-right pixel of each object.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule can be summarized as: Find every separated figure colored in azure. Find the top-right pixel of this object. Convert this pixel to blue.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
