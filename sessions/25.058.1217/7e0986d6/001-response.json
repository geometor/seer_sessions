The transformation seems to involve selectively removing certain colors based on their surroundings or overall pattern. The key seems to be identifying and removing specific colors, while leaving others untouched. The transformation is not a simple global color swap, but is context-dependent. In particular non-zero colors that do not touch any zero values, are removed.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
