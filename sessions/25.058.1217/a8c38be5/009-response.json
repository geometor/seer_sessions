The digits range from 0 to 9.  The input grid appears to have scattered single-color objects or regions, many of which are composed of the digit 5 (gray). The output grid seems to be a condensed, reshaped version of the input grid. It has a rectangular shape and seems to be composed of objects taken from the input. It also contains gray pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider each of these regions as an individual object.\n2. **Sort Objects** Create a list of the identified objects.\n3.  **Arrange Objects:** Starting from the top-left corner and, going left to right then top to bottom, placing each identified object next to each other. The objects keeps its relative rotation, however they are now aligned in a tight rectangular grid.\n4.  **Fill Background:** Fill all remaining pixels in the new grid with the color gray (5).\n5. **Reshape.** Create a boundary with a width and height that contains the objects and the padding\n\nEssentially, the transformation takes the non-gray objects from the input, arranges them, and places them on a gray background, forming a new rectangular grid.\n"
