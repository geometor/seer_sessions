facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Output grids seem to be a compressed or cropped version of the input.
  - observation: "0" represents the background (white) and is absent in the output except when included as part of an object.
  - observation: Non-zero values represent colored objects.
  - observation: Objects are contiguous blocks of the same color.
  - observation: objects are 3x3 blocks, maybe larger, maybe 1xN
  - object_property: objects can consist of multiple colors
  - observation: the number of objects in the input equals the number of objects in the output
  - observation: Object colors in the output match their corresponding colors in the input.
  - observation: object position transforms from the input to output
  - action: objects are extracted, and the grid is down sized, removing all background pixels
  - relation: Output grid size is determined by the bounding box of the combined collection of all the identified non-zero objects
  - relation: Each object in the output has a corresponding object in the input
  - relation: The output grid maintains the spatial relationships of the objects, just without the blank space, and without the concept of "background"
