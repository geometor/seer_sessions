Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on identifying the core transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements**

The task involves transforming input grids to output grids. The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The most prominent feature is the presence of isolated "objects" within the grids, where an object seems to be defined as a contiguous block of non-zero pixels. The background is consistently filled with '0' (white). The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids, seem only to include objects, and contain only gray and the colored object pixels from the input.

**YAML Fact Documentation**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Output grids seem to be a compressed or cropped version of the input.
  - observation: "0" represents the background (white) and is absent in the output except when included as part of an object.
  - observation: Non-zero values represent colored objects.
  - observation: Objects are contiguous blocks of the same color.
  - observation: objects are 3x3 blocks, maybe larger, maybe 1xN
  - object_property: objects can consist of multiple colors
  - observation: the number of objects in the input equals the number of objects in the output
  - observation: Object colors in the output match their corresponding colors in the input.
  - observation: object position transforms from the input to output
  - action: objects are extracted, and the grid is down sized, removing all background pixels
  - relation: Output grid size is determined by the bounding box of the combined collection of all the identified non-zero objects
  - relation: Each object in the output has a corresponding object in the input
  - relation: The output grid maintains the spatial relationships of the objects, just without the blank space, and without the concept of "background"

```



**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid to identify all contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels. Consider each of these blocks as a separate object.
2.  **Record Object:** for each object, remember its color(s)
3.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices that encompass *all* identified objects. This defines the dimensions of the output grid.
4. **Translate Object positions:** for the output grid, position the objects relative to each other, removing any blank spaces.
5.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the dimensions determined in step 3. Fill the grid with only the colored object's pixels in their translated position, effectively cropping out all of the original background spaces.
