Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of digits, representing colored pixels. The digits range from 0 to 9.  The input grid appears to have scattered single-color objects or regions, many of which are composed of the digit 5 (gray). The output grid seems to be a condensed, reshaped version of the input grid. It has a rectangular shape and seems to be composed of objects taken from the input. It also contains gray pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: colored_regions
    type: contiguous_pixels
    properties:
      color: varies (0-9)
      shape: irregular in input, rectangular in output
      size: varies
    actions:
      - moved
      - reshaped
  - name: background
    type: contiguous_pixels
    properties:
      color: 5 (gray)
      shape: filled input, surrounds objects in output
      size: large
    actions:
      - compressed

relationships:
  - type: object_containment
    description: Input grid contains multiple colored regions and a gray background.
  - type: spatial
    description: Colored regions are scattered in the input and more organized/compacted in output
  - type: transformation
    description:  The transformation rearranges colored regions into rectangle and fills the background with grey pixels.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Identify all contiguous regions of non-gray (non-5) pixels in the input grid. Consider each of these regions as an individual object.
2. **Sort Objects** Create a list of the identified objects.
3.  **Arrange Objects:** Starting from the top-left corner and, going left to right then top to bottom, placing each identified object next to each other. The objects keeps its relative rotation, however they are now aligned in a tight rectangular grid.
4.  **Fill Background:** Fill all remaining pixels in the new grid with the color gray (5).
5. **Reshape.** Create a boundary with a width and height that contains the objects and the padding

Essentially, the transformation takes the non-gray objects from the input, arranges them, and places them on a gray background, forming a new rectangular grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
