The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The most prominent feature is the presence of isolated \"objects\" within the grids, where an object seems to be defined as a contiguous block of non-zero pixels. The background is consistently filled with '0' (white). The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids, seem only to include objects, and contain only gray and the colored object pixels from the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

Consider each of these blocks as a separate object.\n2.  **Record Object:** for each object, remember its color(s)\n3.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices that encompass *all* identified objects. This defines the dimensions of the output grid.\n4. **Translate Object positions:** for the output grid, position the objects relative to each other, removing any blank spaces.\n5.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the dimensions determined in step 3. Fill the grid with only the colored object's pixels in their translated position, effectively cropping out all of the original background spaces.\n\n"
