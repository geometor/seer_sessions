facts:
  - observation: |
      Orange pixels (value 7) are sometimes mirrored across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
  - condition: |
      Mirroring of orange pixels appears to be dependent on the presence of other non-zero, non-orange pixels.  If NO other colors besides orange and black, there is no mirroring.
  - object_interaction: |
      Orange pixels interact with the diagonal based on the presence of other colors.
  - color_handling: |
      Only orange pixels (7) are potentially modified. All other colors remain unchanged.
