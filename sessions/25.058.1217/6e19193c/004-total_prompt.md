Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, mostly black (0) with some orange (7) pixels. The orange pixels appear to be moving and changing in number. The overall grid size seems consistent (10x10). The core operation appears to relate to the arrangement and possibly quantity of the orange pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 10
      columns: 10
      cells: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - 0 (black)
        - 7 (orange)
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: movement/rearrangement
    description: Orange pixels seem to shift positions.
  - type: change_in_quantity
    description: increase of orange pixels

relationships:
    - orange pixels with adjacent pixels
    - orange pixel position relative to entire grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all orange (7) pixels in the input grid.
2. **Mirror**: create new pixels as a reflection across the diagonal axis running top-left to bottom right
3. **Combine:** Combine the original orange pixels with the newly created mirrored pixels,
4.  **Output:**  produce the resulting grid, ensuring pixels are in their new locations.

In essence, the transformation mirrors the orange pixels across the main diagonal.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
