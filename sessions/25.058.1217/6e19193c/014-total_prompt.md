"""
The transformation rule involves identifying maroon (9) pixel clusters in the input grid and reflecting them across either the horizontal or vertical centerline of the grid, depending on the cluster's position and shape. The original maroon clusters are preserved. The background pixels (non-maroon) are also copied directly from the input to the output.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, which led to an oversimplified transformation rule. The core idea of reflecting maroon clusters is valid, but the conditions for choosing the reflection axis (horizontal or vertical) are insufficient and incorrect in some cases. The code sometimes reflects over the wrong axis, or reflects clusters it shouldn't.

The strategy to resolve these issues is as follows:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine the input and output grids for each training example.  Pay close attention to how the maroon clusters are transformed (or not transformed).
2.  **Identify Incorrect Assumptions:** Based on the analysis, pinpoint the specific assumptions in the current natural language program and code that are causing errors.
3.  **Refine the Reflection Rule:** Develop a more robust and accurate rule for determining *when* and *how* to reflect the maroon clusters. This might involve considering the cluster's position relative to the grid's center, its shape, and possibly its size. It is critical to determine what is *not* transformed.
4. **Update Program:** Update the natural language description.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**

I need to programmatically analyze the discrepancies between the expected outputs and the actual outputs of the `transform` function. Here's a breakdown of the process, followed by the results.
I will use numpy to compare and report.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(task):
    results = []
    for example in task['train']:
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        expected_output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        predicted_output_grid = transform(input_grid.copy())

        # calculate the difference
        diff = predicted_output_grid != expected_output_grid
        num_diffs = np.sum(diff)

        results.append({
            'input_shape': input_grid.shape,
            'output_shape': expected_output_grid.shape,
            'predicted_output_shape': predicted_output_grid.shape,
            'same_shape': expected_output_grid.shape == predicted_output_grid.shape,
            'differences': num_diffs,
            'diff_positions': np.argwhere(diff).tolist(),

        })
    return results

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: maroon_pixel
    properties:
      color: maroon (9)
      shape: single pixel or cluster
      location: varies
    actions:
      - description: Maroon pixels on the edge are sometimes reflected to the opposite edge.
        conditions:
          - The maroon pixel is a single pixel and on the edge of the grid.
  - object: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
    actions:
      - description: remains unchanged
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Maroon Pixels:** Locate all maroon (9) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Edge Check and Reflect:** If a maroon pixel is a single pixel, and is on the edge of the grid, then reflect that pixel to the opposite edge of its row or column.
3.  **Preserve Background:** All non-maroon (background) pixels remain unchanged.
4. If a cluster is not along the edge, do not change.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
