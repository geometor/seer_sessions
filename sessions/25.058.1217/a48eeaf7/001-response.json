The primary colors observed are white (0), gray (5), and red (2).  The grids are 10x10. The key difference between the input and output grids appears to be the rearrangement of the gray (5) pixels, seemingly in relation to the position of the red (2) pixels. The gray pixels are moving, but the red pixels remain in place.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
