Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10).
*   The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors.
*   Most of the grid cells are '0' (white).
*   There are isolated colored pixels and a 2x2 block of '2' (red) pixels.
*   The '5' (gray) pixels seem to move, and their final positions seem to relate to the 2x2 red block.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: gray_pixels
    type: pixel
    color: gray (5)
    initial_positions: [(0,3), (3,8), (7,7)]
    final_positions: [(2,3), (3,5), (5,5)]
  - id: red_block
    type: block
    color: red (2)
    dimensions: 2x2
    initial_position: (3,3)
    final_position: (3,3) # Stays the same

actions:
  - type: move
    agent: gray_pixels
    target: red_block # Implied, see natural language program

relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: gray_pixels
    object2: red_block
    description: Gray pixels reposition relative to the red block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all gray (5) pixels and the 2x2 red (2) block in the input grid.
2.  **Red Block as Anchor:** Consider the top-left corner of the 2x2 red block as an anchor point.
3. **Relative shift of grey pixels:**
    The grey pixels are moved in a way that the occupy the locations that complete a 4x4 square together with the red block.

In other words, the gray pixels move to form a larger square together with the red block, filling the missing parts of the 4x4 matrix.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
