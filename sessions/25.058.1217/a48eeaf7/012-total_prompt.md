Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example, which involved moving gray pixels diagonally adjacent to a 2x2 red square. The code successfully identifies the red square and attempts to move the gray pixels closer. However, the existing logic seems overly verbose and doesn't generalize well to other examples.

The strategy for improvement involves these steps:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Examine each input/output pair, noting the exact movements of gray pixels relative to the red square (if present). We'll pay close attention to edge cases and scenarios where the red square might not be present.
2.  **Refine Movement Logic:** The current code's movement logic is complex and specific. We need a more general rule for how gray pixels move, likely involving relative position to the red square, and possibly other factors we haven't identified yet.
3.  **Consider Other Objects:** Are there other objects beside the gray pixels and 2x2 red square?
4.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Based on the refined analysis, formulate a concise and accurate natural language description of the transformation.
5.  **Iterative Refinement:** This is an iterative process. We'll likely need to repeat these steps as we test the code on more examples.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**
Here are examples:

```python
import numpy as np

def find_red_square(grid):
    # Find the top-left corner coordinates of the red square
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for r in range(rows - 1):
        for c in range(cols - 1):
            if grid[r, c] == 2 and grid[r+1, c] == 2 and grid[r, c+1] == 2 and grid[r+1, c+1] == 2:
                return (r, c)  # Return top-left corner
    return None

def find_gray_pixels(grid):
    # Find coordinates of all gray pixels
    return np.argwhere(grid == 5)

def calculate_accuracy(predicted_output, expected_output):
     return np.all(predicted_output == expected_output)
    
def report(task_name, input_grid, predicted_output, expected_output):

    gray_pixels = find_gray_pixels(input_grid)    
    
    print(f"{red_square=}")
    print(f"{gray_pixels=}")

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
- objects:
    - name: gray_pixel
      color: gray (5)
      instances: varies
      properties:
        - movable: true
        - movement_rule: "move one step closer to the center of the grid, either horizontally or vertically, only if a red square is present"

    - name: red_square
      color: red (2)
      instances: 0 or 1
      properties:
        - size: 2x2
        - movable: false
        - role: "reference point for gray pixel movement"
        
    - name: background
      color: azure (8)
      properties:
        - movable: false

- actions:
    - name: move_gray_pixel
      agent: gray_pixel
      condition: "if a red_square is present"
      precondition:
        - gray_pixel_exists
      postcondition:
        - "gray_pixel is one step closer to the center of the image along either horizontal or vertical"
        - "gray_pixel color remains gray (5)"

- task_goal: "reposition gray pixels based on red square presence and location"

- constraints:
    - "gray pixels move only one step"
    - "gray pixels change either row or column, but not both simultaneously"
    - "if no red square, no transformations occur"

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all gray (5) pixels and check for the presence of a 2x2 red (2) square.
2.  **Conditional Transformation:**
    *   If a red square is present, move each gray pixel one step closer to the center of the entire grid.
    *   The movement must be exclusively horizontal or vertical – never diagonal.  Gray pixels will only move in one direction.
    *   The choice of movement is decided by reducing either the horizontal or vertical distance to center, prioritizing the larger change.
3.  **No Red Square, No Change:** If no red square is found, the output grid is identical to the input grid.

**Key Improvements and Insights**

*   **Center-Based Movement:** The core change is shifting from movement relative to the red square to movement towards the *center of the grid*, conditioned on the *presence* of the red square.
*   **Simplified Movement Rule:** The one-step horizontal *or* vertical movement replaces the previous, more complicated logic.
*    **Handles No Red Square:** The program now explicitly states the behavior when no red square is found.
*   **No Diagonal Movement:** Gray pixels only move horizontally or vertically to get one step closer to the center of the image.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
