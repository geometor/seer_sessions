            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, focusing on identifying a 2x2 red block and moving a single gray pixel adjacent to it. However, the execution on the full training set reveals that this rule is too specific and doesn't generalize to all cases. The primary issue is that the position of the grey pixel is not always one above and to the left. It is dependent on the orientation of the red pixels and the available adjacent space. The code also doesn't account for red blocks not being present, nor for red shapes that are not 2x2, as shown by the different results. The concept of removing the original grey pixel if one moves is working correctly.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** The core assumption about the gray pixel's target position relative to the red block is incorrect. We need to generalize the rule for finding the target position.\n2.  **Broaden Object Recognition:** Consider that the red \"object\" may not always be a 2x2 block.\n3.  **Conditional Logic:** Improve the handling of cases where no red block is found, no grey pixel, and target position is already occupied.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using the provided results):**\n\n*   **Example 0 (Correct):**\n    *   Input has a 2x2 red block and a gray pixel.\n    *   Gray pixel is moved correctly to a position diagonally adjacent to the top-left of the red block.\n    *   Other grey pixels are removed.\n*   **Example 1 (Incorrect):**\n    *   Input has four red pixels in a vertical line, and a grey pixel.\n    *   The code moves the grey pixel to -1,-1 (because of how `find_block` works) and then fails to move the pixel because it goes out of bounds.\n    *   Other grey pixels are removed.\n*    **Example 2 (Incorrect):**\n    *  Input has a 2x2 block of red and two grey pixels.\n    *  The code moves the grey correctly to position above and left.\n    *   Other grey pixels are removed.\n*    **Example 3 (Incorrect):**\n    * Input has four red pixels in a horizontal line, and a grey pixel.\n    *   The code moves the grey pixel to -1,-1 (because of how `find_block` works) and then fails to move the pixel because it goes out of bounds.\n    *   Other grey pixels are removed.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object_types:\n    - name: red_object\n      properties:\n        - color: red\n        - shape: variable # Can be a 2x2 block, vertical line, or horizontal line.\n    - name: gray_pixel\n      properties:\n        - color: gray\n        - count: variable  # one or more\n  - actions:\n    - name: move_gray_pixel\n      description: >\n        Moves a single gray pixel to a position adjacent to the red object.\n        The target location may be on any side, and must be empty.\n      preconditions:\n        - A red object exists.\n        - At least one gray pixel exists.\n        - An open space exists adjacent to the red object.\n      postconditions:\n        - One gray pixel is adjacent to the red object.\n        - Other gray pixels are removed.\n  - context:\n      - task_goal: Relocate a single gray pixel based on the presence and shape of a red object.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Red Object:** Find any contiguous red shape (not just a 2x2 block).\n2.  **Identify Gray Pixels:** Find all gray pixels.\n3.  **Determine Target Position:**\n    *   If a red object exists, find an empty (black/0) cell that is *directly* adjacent (up, down, left, or right, *not* diagonal) to any part of the red object.\n    *   Prioritize positions that maintain the closest proximity to the original grey pixel position.\n4.  **Move Gray Pixel (if possible):**\n    *   If a gray pixel and a valid, empty target position exist, move *one* gray pixel to the target position.\n    *   Clear the cell of origin of any moved grey pixel.\n5.  **Remove other Grey:**\n    *   Remove all other grey pixels from the grid.\n6. **No Change if No Target**\n    *  If a valid target position can not be found, the grid should remain unchanged.\n\nThis revised natural language program provides a more generalized rule that should account for the variations observed in the training examples. The key improvements are considering different shapes for the red object and defining the target position as any adjacent empty cell, removing the restriction to only cells above and to the left.\n"
