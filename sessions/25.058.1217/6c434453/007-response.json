The transformation seems to depend more on local patterns.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Create the output grid with all white first.\n\n2. Iterate input pixels.\n    * If the pixel is blue(1)\n    *   If this blue pixel forms part of the 1x3 or 3x1 blue block then paint this pixel to red, otherwise, if there are no adjacent blue pixels, keep the pixel blue.\n    *    If this blue pixel creates a corner on 3x3 block, paint the corner to red.\n\n3. If the pixel is white(0). Check its neighbors.\n    *   If the white pixel is next to a blue pixel vertically, or horizontally. Copy the blue pixel to output.\n    *   If the white pixel is next to a red pixel vertically, or horizontally. Copy the red pixel to output.\n    *   If the white pixel is next to both red and blue, perform the above check twice, in that order.\n\nThis program aims to capture the observed changes, specifically focusing on the neighborhood of each pixel. The key idea is that the blue pixels in certain configurations are changing to red and blue outlines contiguous areas that were blue on the input.\n"
