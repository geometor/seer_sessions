Okay, let's analyze this input-output example pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both 10x10 grids.
*   The input grid contains pixels of color blue (1) and white (0).
*   The output grid contains pixels of color blue (1), red (2), and white (0).
*   It appears that some blue (1) pixels in the input are changing to red (2) in the output, while others remain blue.
*   White (0) pixels in the input may remain the same or change to blue or red.
* It seems there is no straightforward geometric transformation (rotation, reflection, etc.). The transformation seems to depend more on local patterns.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    input_colors: [white, blue]
    output_colors: [white, blue, red]

observations:
  - blue_to_red: Some input blue pixels become red in the output.
  - blue_to_blue: Some input blue pixels remain blue in the output.
  - white_to_white: some input white pixels remain as white.
  - white_to_blue: some input white pixels change to blue.
  - white_to_red: some input white pixels change to red
  - locality: The transformation of a pixel seems to depend on its neighbors.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the output grid being a copy of the input grid.

2.  **Blue Pixel Transformation:**
    *   Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
    *   If a pixel in input is blue (1):
        *   If the blue pixel is part of a contiguous 3x1 or 1x3 block of blue pixels change to red (2), while preserving the outline of the blue blocks.
        *   If the blue pixel is on a corner created by contiguous 3x3 block of blue pixels, change the corner pixel to red(2)
    *   If a pixel is not part of contiguous block, remain the pixel as blue

3.  **White Pixel Transformation:**
    * If a pixel in input is white(0):
         *   If there is adjacent blue pixel to current pixel, maintain the current pixel value
        *   If the white pixel is adjacent to red(2), and above steps, the current pixel will change to red if its adjacent red pixels in horizonally or vertically contiguous.
        *  otherwise, do nothing

Let's refine the natural language program to be more explicit and testable.

1. Create the output grid with all white first.

2. Iterate input pixels.
    * If the pixel is blue(1)
    *   If this blue pixel forms part of the 1x3 or 3x1 blue block then paint this pixel to red, otherwise, if there are no adjacent blue pixels, keep the pixel blue.
    *    If this blue pixel creates a corner on 3x3 block, paint the corner to red.

3. If the pixel is white(0). Check its neighbors.
    *   If the white pixel is next to a blue pixel vertically, or horizontally. Copy the blue pixel to output.
    *   If the white pixel is next to a red pixel vertically, or horizontally. Copy the red pixel to output.
    *   If the white pixel is next to both red and blue, perform the above check twice, in that order.

This program aims to capture the observed changes, specifically focusing on the neighborhood of each pixel. The key idea is that the blue pixels in certain configurations are changing to red and blue outlines contiguous areas that were blue on the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
