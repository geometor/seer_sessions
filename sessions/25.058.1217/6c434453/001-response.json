The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of blue (1) pixels with red (2) pixels, and in other cases blue pixels remain unchanged. The shape and arrangement of the blue pixels appear to be crucial, with certain configurations being replaced and others not. There isn't an obvious geometric transformation like rotation or mirroring, but rather a pattern-based substitution.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"
