Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0).

2.  **Blue to Red Transformation:** Iterate through each pixel of the *input* grid.
    *   If a pixel is blue (1):
        *   If it's part of a 1x3 or 3x1 blue block (excluding isolated blues and 2-blocks), change it to red (2) in the *output* grid.
        *   If it is the corner of a 3x3 blue block, change it to red (2) in the *output* grid.
        *   Otherwise, keep the pixel blue (1) in the *output* grid.

3.  **White Pixel Propagation:** Iterate through each pixel of the *input* grid.
    *   If a pixel is white (0):
        *   Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).
        *   If a neighbor is red (2) in the *output* grid, change the current pixel to red (2) in the *output* grid.
        *   Otherwise, if a neighbor is blue (1) in the *input* grid, change the current pixel to blue (1) in the *output* grid.

4. **Return Output:** The output grid now contains the final transformed image.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
