objects:
  - name: blue_shapes
    type: contiguous_regions
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - shape: irregular
      - size: varies

  - name: red_shapes
    type: contiguous_regions
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - shape: potentially derived from blue_shapes
      - size: potentially derived from blue_shapes

  - name: background
    type: region
    color: white (0)
    properties:
        - shape: fills remaining space

actions:
  - name: transform
    input: blue_shapes
    output: red_shapes
    description:  Blue shapes are either replaced by or transformed into red shapes, but not all blue becomes red

  - name: remain
    input: background
    output: background
    description: White background stays mostly the same.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The red shapes in the output appear to occupy locations related to the blue shapes' original positions in the input. It is almost like the top left blue cluster "moves" down one and left one and becomes red, the middle-left cluster "moves" up one and right one and becomes red.
