Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10).
*   The input grid contains two colors: white (0) and blue (1).
*   The output grid contains three colors: white (0), blue (1), and red (2).
*   The blue regions in the input seem to be related to the red regions in the output.
*   The white regions seem to remain largely unchanged, except where red replaces blue or near where red exists.
*   It seems some blue object have moved, expanded, or otherwise become red.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_shapes
    type: contiguous_regions
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - shape: irregular
      - size: varies

  - name: red_shapes
    type: contiguous_regions
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - shape: potentially derived from blue_shapes
      - size: potentially derived from blue_shapes

  - name: background
    type: region
    color: white (0)
    properties:
        - shape: fills remaining space

actions:
  - name: transform
    input: blue_shapes
    output: red_shapes
    description:  Blue shapes are either replaced by or transformed into red shapes, but not all blue becomes red

  - name: remain
    input: background
    output: background
    description: White background stays mostly the same.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The red shapes in the output appear to occupy locations related to the blue shapes' original positions in the input. It is almost like the top left blue cluster "moves" down one and left one and becomes red, the middle-left cluster "moves" up one and right one and becomes red.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all contiguous blue (1) regions (objects) in the input grid.
2.  **Locate** two distinct groups:
    * Group 1: the blue shapes in the top left corner
    * Group 2: the three blue lines next to each other on the left
3. **Transform as follows:**
     *  Group 1: shift the blue object down one row and left one column and change the color to red.
     * Group 2: Shift the blue object up one row and to the right one column, change the color to red.
4. All other pixels are unchanged.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
