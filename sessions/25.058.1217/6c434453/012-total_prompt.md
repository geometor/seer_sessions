Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0).

2.  **Blue to Red Transformation:** Iterate through each pixel of the *input* grid.
    *   If a pixel is blue (1):
        *   If it's part of a 1x3 or 3x1 blue block (excluding isolated blues and 2-blocks), change it to red (2) in the *output* grid.
        *   If it is the corner of a 3x3 blue block, change it to red (2) in the *output* grid.
        *   Otherwise, keep the pixel blue (1) in the *output* grid.

3.  **White Pixel Propagation:** Iterate through each pixel of the *input* grid.
    *   If a pixel is white (0):
        *   Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).
        *   If a neighbor is red (2) in the *output* grid, change the current pixel to red (2) in the *output* grid.
        *   Otherwise, if a neighbor is blue (1) in the *input* grid, change the current pixel to blue (1) in the *output* grid.

4. **Return Output:** The output grid now contains the final transformed image.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a revised natural language program and strategy.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, and as expected, it doesn't generalize perfectly to all cases. The core idea of identifying blue blocks and propagating colors is partially correct, but there are clear discrepancies. The main issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Blue Block Identification:** The `check_blue_block` function only considers 1x3 or 3x1 blocks. It misses other configurations where blue pixels should turn red.
2.  **3x3 Corner Detection:** The `check_3x3_corner` attempts to locate blue squares, but the logic may be off.
3. **Overly Aggressive Red Propagation:** It seems like red is propagating too far in some cases. The rules for when a white pixel becomes red need refinement. Specifically, the existing condition to turn white pixels that neighbor a red pixel red is incorrect.
4. **Incorrect Blue Propagation** The algorithm is propagating blue into white areas that should not be blue.

The strategy to address these issues is as follows:

1.  **Refine Blue Block Detection:** We need a more robust way to identify blue regions that should become red. This might involve checking for connected components of blue pixels rather than just simple horizontal/vertical lines.
2.  **Revisit Propagation Rules:** Carefully examine the examples to determine the *exact* conditions under which white pixels turn red or blue. The current prioritization of red propagation is likely incorrect.
3.  **Consider All Examples:** Ensure the updated natural language program and code account for *all* provided training examples, not just the first one.

**Example and Result Metrics**

To understand the errors better, I'll use code execution to gather specific metrics for each example. I'll focus on:

*   Input and Output shapes
*   Number of blue and red pixels in the input and output
*   Differences between the expected output and the generated output.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: BlueBlock
    color: blue
    shape: rectangle # could be any rectangular arrangement of blue pixels
    properties:
      - contiguous: true # pixels must be adjacent (up, down, left, right)
  - name: RedBlock
    color: red
    shape: rectangle
    properties:
        - contiguous: true

actions:
  - name: TransformBlueToRed
    input: BlueBlock
    output: RedBlock
    rule: "If there are one or more contiguous blue pixels, change all of them to red."

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Blue Blocks:** Find all contiguous regions of blue pixels. Contiguous means connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
2.  **Transform:** Change all blue pixels within the identified blue blocks to red.
3.  **Output:** The output grid is the result of the transformation. All blue pixels are replaced by red, all other input colors remain the same.

The critical simplification here is realizing that *any* connected group of blue pixels, regardless of its shape, turns red. The previous program was too focused on specific shapes (1x3, 3x1, 3x3 corners). This simplified rule covers all the observed cases.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
