```python
"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:

1. Create the output grid with all white first.

2. Iterate input pixels.
    * If the pixel is blue(1)
    *   If this blue pixel forms part of the 1x3 or 3x1 blue block then paint this pixel to red, otherwise, if there are no adjacent blue pixels, keep the pixel blue.
    *    If this blue pixel creates a corner on 3x3 block, paint the corner to red.

3. If the pixel is white(0). Check its neighbors.
    *   If the white pixel is next to a blue pixel vertically, or horizontally. Copy the blue pixel to output.
    *   If the white pixel is next to a red pixel vertically, or horizontally. Copy the red pixel to output.
    *   If the white pixel is next to both red and blue, perform the above check twice, in that order.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and observations.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example, and it seems to capture some, but not all, of the transformation rules. The errors in the subsequent examples reveal that the logic for handling white pixels adjacent to both blue and red pixels needs improvement. Specifically, the order of copying matters, and the initial attempt to iterate twice has some overlaps that create an incorrect outcome.

The overall strategy will be:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Examine each input/output/predicted output carefully, noting discrepancies and identifying the specific conditions causing the errors.
2.  **Refine Conditions:** Improve the conditional checks in the `transform` function, mainly in the sections handling the white pixels and propagation of colors, to correctly implement precedence of red and blue filling.
3. **Prioritize Red**: It looks like red pixels are placed and should not be overwritten, but blue pixels can be replaced.

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including metrics and observations:

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_metrics(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_output_grid):
    """Calculates pixel-wise accuracy, error count, and identifies error locations."""
    correct_pixels = np.sum(output_grid == predicted_output_grid)
    total_pixels = output_grid.size
    accuracy = correct_pixels / total_pixels
    error_count = total_pixels - correct_pixels
    error_locations = np.where(output_grid != predicted_output_grid)
    return accuracy, error_count, error_locations

def analyze_example(example_number, input_grid, output_grid, predicted_output_grid):

    accuracy, error_count, error_locations = calculate_metrics(
        input_grid, output_grid, predicted_output_grid
    )
    print(f"--- Example {example_number} ---")
    print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
    print(f"Error Count: {error_count}")
    print(f"Error Locations (row, col):")
    if error_count >0:
        for r, c in zip(*error_locations):
            print(f"  ({r}, {c}) - Expected: {output_grid[r, c]}, Predicted: {predicted_output_grid[r, c]}")
    else:
        print("  None")

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0).

2.  **Blue to Red Transformation:** Iterate through each pixel of the *input* grid.
    *   If a pixel is blue (1):
        *   If it's part of a 1x3 or 3x1 blue block (excluding isolated blues and 2-blocks), change it to red (2) in the *output* grid.
        *   If it is the corner of a 3x3 blue block, change it to red (2) in the *output* grid.
        *   Otherwise, keep the pixel blue (1) in the *output* grid.

3.  **White Pixel Propagation:** Iterate through each pixel of the *input* grid.
    *   If a pixel is white (0):
        *   Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).
        *   If a neighbor is red (2) in the *output* grid, change the current pixel to red (2) in the *output* grid.
        *   Otherwise, if a neighbor is blue (1) in the *input* grid, change the current pixel to blue (1) in the *output* grid.

4. **Return Output:** The output grid now contains the final transformed image.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
