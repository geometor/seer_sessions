The input grid contains several distinct colored \"objects,\" which appear to be rectangular blocks of uniform color. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, extracting and rearranging these colored blocks. The colors in the output are the same as those in the input, and the relative shapes formed by same-color groups of pixels seems important. Empty areas (value 0, white) in the input grid do not appear in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Treat each of these blocks as a separate object.\n2. **Extract Objects:** For each identified object, record its color and dimensions. Discard any surrounding white pixels (value 0).\n3. **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an empty output grid (the example provided is 4x4, it is not clear if this should be determined or is constant - more examples would be needed to make a determination).\n4. **Arrange Objects:** Place each extracted object within the output grid as 1 x N or Nx1 blocks, where N is the number of non-zero pixels in each object, maintaining the color. Specifically, it appears the objects are rotated to fit within the output and oriented horizontally (1xN).\n5. **Order Objects:** It appears from the given example, the order is Azure, Red, Green, and then Blue. More examples are needed to confirm.\n\nThe program appears to extract colored rectangular objects from the input grid, convert all shapes to horizontal or vertical bars based on the input, and position them in the output grid, preserving their colors. It seems to ignore white cells in the input grid.\n\nI hypothesize that the dimensions and layout in the output have some relationship to the input, specifically that vertical blocks become horizontal, and the number of non-zero pixels are the same.\n"
