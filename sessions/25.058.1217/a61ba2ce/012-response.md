Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation logic:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial strategy, based on the first example, was to identify objects of certain colors (1, 8, 4, 2) and place them into quadrants of a 4x4 output grid based on their color. The relative position of pixels within each object was maintained in the output. This approach worked for the first example but failed for the second and third.

The primary reason for failure is that the rule is too specific and doesn't generalize. The second example contains colors other than the predefined ones, and the dimensions and structure of the input vary considerably. The third example is an extreme case - input grid is a solid, single-color.

The strategy needs to shift from *quadrant placement* to *object identification, color prioritization, and minimal bounding box extraction*. We should focus on creating a bounding box around the *significant* colors, then extract it. We also need to determine what colors are *significant* in each example.

**Metrics and Observations**

To gather more specific information, I will use a code execution. I will evaluate properties of each of the examples

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of non-zero pixels in the input grid.
2. **Determine Significant Colors:** The output grid will contain a subset of colors in the input
    grid. Significant colors appear to be, in order of priority, are:
        Example 1: 1, 8, 4, 2
        Example 2: 1, 8, 4
        Example 3: 7
3. **Create Combined Bounding Box:** For each significant colors, find all pixels with that color
    in the input grid. Create one combined bounding box for all pixels of all significant colors.
4.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Extract the rectangular region defined by the combined bounding box from the input grid.
5.  **Output:** The extracted sub-grid is the output. If no significant colors found - return an empty grid? (need clarification on edge case)

**Refinements and Questions:**

*   **Color Priority:** I've listed the apparent significant colors, but is there a consistent rule for determining this? Should we assume it varies per task?
* **Empty Grids** What to return if no object of the colors listed?
* **Object Interaction:** There's no object interaction in these examples, just extraction.
* **Output Size** Is is always necessary to find all objects or just one of each color?

This revised program should handle all three examples correctly. It's more general and focuses on identifying and extracting relevant parts of the input grid based on color significance.
