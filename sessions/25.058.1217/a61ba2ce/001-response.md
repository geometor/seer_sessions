Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a large, mostly empty grid (filled with 0s, representing white) containing a few isolated colored 2x1, 1x2, or 2x2 blocks into a smaller 4x4 grid. The output grid seems to represent a condensed or summarized version of the input, retaining only the colored blocks and their spatial arrangement relative *to each other*. The empty space (white pixels) within and around each colored block in the input grid is discarded in the output grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: colored_blocks
    properties:
      - color: varies (blue, red, green, yellow, azure)
      - shape: 2x1, 1x2, or 2x2 rectangles
      - location: original (x, y) coordinates in input grid
    actions:
      - moved: spatially translated to new relative positions
      - resized: maintain shape, discard surrounding empty space.
    relationships:
      - relative_position: spatial arrangement maintained in output
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: large, mostly empty (13x13)
      - background: white (0)
    actions:
      - condensed: transformed into a smaller (4x4) grid.
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
       - dimensions: 4x4
       - content: contains only the colored blocks, re-arranged spatially
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Blocks:** Scan the input grid and identify all contiguous blocks of non-zero (non-white) pixels. Each of these blocks represents an "object". Record the color, shape (2x1, 1x2 or 2x2), and top-left corner coordinates of each block.

2.  **Determine Relative Positions:** Analyze the spatial relationships between the identified colored blocks. Determine minimal bounding box containing all blocks.

3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 4x4 output grid initialized with all zeros (white).

4.  **Place Blocks:** For each identified colored block:
        Place the colored block's pixels into the output grid, start at the upper-left corner, and arranging them in rows, then filling remaining spaces with '0', and respecting the observed ordering.

5. **Order of blocks**: Iterate through the input grid and output the colored blocks in the order that you encounter them.

In essence, the transformation extracts the colored blocks from the input grid, removes the surrounding empty space, and places them in a new, smaller grid, maintaining their relative spatial arrangement and order of appearance in the input.
