        - color: 8
          shape: line
          dimensions: 1x6
          size: 6
        - color: 2
          shape: line
          dimensions: 1x3
          size: 3
        - color: 3
          shape: line
          dimensions: 1x3
          size: 3
        - color: 1
          shape: line
          dimensions: 1x2
          size: 2
      output_grid_dimensions: 4x8
      transformation: Objects are transformed into horizontal lines of the same color and size (number of pixels), stacked vertically.
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: 4
          shape: rectangle
          dimensions: 4x4
          size: 16
        - color: 3
          shape: rectangle
          dimensions: 3x3
          size: 9
      output_objects:
        - color: 4
          shape: line
          dimensions: 1x8
          size: 8
        - color: 3
          shape: line
          dimensions: 1x6
          size: 6
      output_grid_dimensions: 2x10
      transformation: Objects are transformed into horizontal lines. The length of the output lines is proportional to, but not the same as, the input size. It is the square root of the size, times two. The two lines are placed in a vertical stack.

      input_objects:
        - color: 6
          shape: rectangle
          dimensions: 3x3

        - color: 7
          shape: rectangle
          dimensions: 6x1
          size: 6
      output_objects:
        - color: 6
          shape: line
          dimensions: 1x9
          size: 9
        - color: 7
          shape: line
          dimensions: 1x6
          size: 6
      output_grid_dimensions: 2x16
      transformation: Objects are transformed into horizontal lines of the same size (number of pixels). The lines are stacked vertically.
