**Perception of the Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of 2D grids containing numerical values representing colors. The primary change seems to be related to the location and color of specific vertical lines. Gray (5) pixels are transformed in some way to form blue(1) and red(2) vertical lines.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - width: 9
      - height: 9
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - name: vertical_line_gray
    type: contiguous block of pixels
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - orientation: vertical
      - length: variable
      - position: (x, y) coordinates

  - name: vertical_line_blue
    type: contiguous block of pixels
    properties:
       -color: blue(1)
       -orientation: vertical
       - length: determined by gray line, keeps x position.
       -position: (x,y)

  - name: vertical_line_red
    type: contiguous block of pixels
       - color: red (2)
       - orientation: vertical
       - length: always 2, keep x of gray line.
       - position: (x, y) coordinates, always at the bottom, below the blue.

actions:
  - name: identify_gray_lines
    description: Locate all vertical lines of gray (5) pixels.

  - name: transform_gray_to_blue
    description: Change the color of a gray line to blue (1), maintaining the same vertical position and length.

  - name: transform_gray_to_red
    description: Add red line of length two, keeping x, but set y to bottom of grid, maintaining same x.

relationships:
   - gray lines in input relate to blue and red in output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Lines:** Scan the input grid to locate all contiguous vertical lines composed entirely of gray (5) pixels.
2.  **Transform to Blue:** For each identified gray line, change all of its pixels to blue (1). Maintain the line's original x-coordinate (column) and length.
3.  **Create Red Line:** For each identified gray vertical line, find the bottom of the grid with gray line x, and create a red (2) line segment of two pixels, keeping the same original x-coordinate.

In essence, the transformation replaces each gray vertical line with a blue vertical line of the same length and position and a red line segment of length=2 at the bottom, keeping x.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
