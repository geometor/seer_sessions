Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 9x9 grid containing the values 0 (white) and 5 (gray).  The gray pixels form a pattern: a vertical line in the center and some scattered gray pixels to the left of it.
*   **Output Grid:** A 9x9 grid containing 0 (white), 1 (blue), and 2 (red). The blue pixels form a vertical line in the same center location as the gray line in the input. The scattered gray pixels on the left in the input are consolidated at their y positions as a solid area of red, down to the bottom.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: [9, 9]
    values: [0, 5]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: [9, 9]
    values: [0, 1, 2]
  - name: gray_line
    type: line
    color: gray
    orientation: vertical
    location: center_column
    input_grid: true
  - name: blue_line
    type: line
    color: blue
    orientation: vertical
    location: center_column
      output_grid: true
  - name: scattered_gray_pixels
    type: pixels
    color: gray
    input_grid: true
    left_of: gray_line
  - name: red_area
    type: area
    color: red
    output_grid: true
    y_positions_from: scattered_gray_pixels

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    object: gray_line
    new_color: blue
  - name: consolidate
    object: scattered_gray_pixels
    new_form: red_area, y_positions, down to bottom

relationships:
  - gray_line: { same_location: blue_line }
  - scattered_gray_pixels: { consolidated,y_positions: red_area }
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Find the vertical line of gray (5) pixels in the center column of the input grid.
2.  **Replace:** In the output grid, change the color of this center line from gray (5) to blue (1), keeping the same location and length.
3.  **Identify Left:** Identify all other gray pixels to the left of the center line.
4. **Consolidate and Transform**: Take x=2, and create a red (2) area starting at the y position of each gray area, and extend it all the way down to the bottom of the grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
