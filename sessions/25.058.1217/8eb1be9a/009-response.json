The input appears to have a horizontal band of red pixels in the middle, with some alternating white pixels. The output expands this pattern, replicating the red and white pattern vertically throughout the entire grid, while keeping the solid red line in its original rows.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Ensure the central solid red line remains.\n4. **Maintain the original red band:** The central rows stay all red (2).\n5. **Expand the alternating pattern:** rows above and below are filled with the alternating pattern.\n\nEssentially, the transformation takes the pattern of red and white pixels *within* the central red band, keeps the center solid band, and propagates the red/white portions of the pattern vertically to fill the rest of the grid.\n"
