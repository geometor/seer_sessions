The input grid contains horizontal lines, and some of the lines appear to be reflected into multiple lines in the output. There is a pattern of colored pixels (azure and red) within a background of white (0) pixels. The crucial aspect seems to be the vertical duplication of certain rows.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
