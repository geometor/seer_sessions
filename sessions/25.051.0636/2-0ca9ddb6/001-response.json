The positions of the centers of these L shapes are one unit above the red cell color.\n\n3.  **Orange/Brown Marks:** An orange cross shape is formed around and including the initial blue cell.\n\n4. **Complete Description** For any single red cell, two yellow cells are placed horizontally symetrically one unit above. And for any single blue cell, a cross of orange color is placed centered on that blue cell.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation involves adding a mirrored L-shape made of yellow color above each initial red cell, and an orange cross centered on the blue cell.\n"
