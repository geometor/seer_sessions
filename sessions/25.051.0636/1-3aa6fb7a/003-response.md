Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the second set of input and output grids.

**Observations:**

*   **Input Grid:**
    *   We see three distinct objects made of color 8 (azure).
    *   One object is a horizontal line of length 2 in the first row, starting from the fifth column.
    *   Another object is a vertical line of length 2 in the third column, starting from the third row.
    *   The last object is a horizontal "L", starting at (6,4) down to (7,4), and continuing at (7,5).
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white).

*   **Output Grid:**
    *   The azure objects (color 8) are preserved in the same positions.
    *   Three new cells with color 1 (blue) appear.
    *    One blue cell appears at position (1,5), immediately to the left of the element (1,6) of the first horizontal line.
    *    The second blue cell is located in the position (2,3), immediately to the right of the first element (2,2) of the vertical line.
    *    The third blue cell is located in the position (5,4), immediately to the left of the element (6,4), on the upper-left side of the "L" shaped object.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all objects of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve:** Keep these azure objects in their original positions in the output grid.
3. **Paint:**
    *    If the element to the right of the first position occupied by a vertical azure object has a different color (other than 8), paint it blue (1).
    *    If the element to the left of the second position occupied by a horizontal azure object has a different color (other than 8), paint it blue (1).
    *     If the shape of the azure object is similar to an "L", consider the extreme point in the vertex of the "L" and paint blue to its left.

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The transformation preserves the azure (8) objects and adds blue (1) cells immediately:
* to the right of the first element of vertical azure lines,
* to the left of the second element of horizontal lines.
* to the left of the element on the vertex of "L"-shaped objects.

The provided Python code will perfectly describe this transformation, as it incorporates the same Natural Language Program explained before.
