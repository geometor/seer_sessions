## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and develop a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same for each example pair.
*   The input grid seems to be rotated and possibly inverted to create the output grid. The colors are maintained during the transformation.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: |
  The task involves transforming a 2D grid of colored pixels into another 2D grid of the same dimensions.
  The transformation appears to be a rotation and/or reflection of the grid, preserving the colors of the pixels.
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x cols)
      - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input_grid
      - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
relationships:
  - type: spatial_transformation
    between: input_grid and output_grid
    description: |
      The output_grid is a transformed version of the input_grid.
      The transformation involves a 90-degree clockwise rotation,
      followed by taking the transpose, (or, equivalently, a reflection along the main diagonal)
      Pixels retain their original colors.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate:** Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2.  **Transpose**: compute the transpose of the rotated grid. The element at row *i*, column *j* is moved to row *j*, column *i*

Another, equivalent, way to perform the transform is to reflect the input across the main diagonal of the image from the upper-left to the lower-right.

The colors of the pixels in the original grid are preserved in the transformed grid.
