task_description: |
  The task involves transforming a 2D grid of colored pixels into another 2D grid of the same dimensions.
  The transformation appears to be a rotation and/or reflection of the grid, preserving the colors of the pixels.
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x cols)
      - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input_grid
      - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
relationships:
  - type: spatial_transformation
    between: input_grid and output_grid
    description: |
      The output_grid is a transformed version of the input_grid.
      The transformation involves a 90-degree clockwise rotation,
      followed by taking the transpose, (or, equivalently, a reflection along the main diagonal)
      Pixels retain their original colors.
