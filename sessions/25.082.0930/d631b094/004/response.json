However, the mapping between the count and the output dimensions is incorrect, as evidenced by Example 4. The code needs to adjust the dimension-mapping logic. The code works perfectly for the first three examples but fails on the forth example.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Example 4:** Carefully examine the input and expected output of Example 4 to understand the correct relationship between the non-black color count and output dimensions.\n2.  **Metrics Gathering:** Although not strictly necessary, as we can visually deduce the error, I will print some details from each pair.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Revise the natural language program to reflect the corrected mapping.\n4.  **Fact YAML and program update**\n\n**Metrics Gathering (Example 4):**\n\n"
