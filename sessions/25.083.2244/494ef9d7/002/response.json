            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code were too simplistic. The idea of swapping pixels within a row was a good starting point, but the condition for swapping (`if input_grid[obj1['row']][obj1['col']] == output_grid[obj1['row']][obj2['col']] and input_grid[obj2['row']][obj2['col']] == output_grid[obj1['row']][obj1['col']]`) is incorrect and doesn't capture the actual transformation logic. It seems to only swap if the pixel values *already* match the swapped values in the *output* grid, making it extremely unlikely that it will modify anything.  The code correctly copies the grid initially. The core issue is the swapping logic, which clearly does not capture the transformation rule of the task. A more sophisticated method is needed to detect *which* pixels to swap based on the patterns seen across all examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** We need to correctly identify \"objects.\"  In this context, objects can simply be non-zero pixels and their coordinates (as the current `find_objects` function does).\n2.  **Relationship Analysis:**  We need to move beyond simple pairwise comparisons. We must examine *all* examples to determine the *rule* that governs which pixels are swapped and which ones are not. It's likely a conditional swap based on relative positions and possibly even colors.\n3.  **Refine Swap Condition:** Replace the existing swap condition with a rule-based condition determined from analyzing all training examples.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using hypothetical `tool_code` - will be expanded in the next iteration):**\n\nI will outline the kinds of analysis that needs to be performed, though the current response system does not support the python tool execution. The reports are deduced by manually inspecting the input/output/expected output.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Swapped Pairs: (2, 7) -> (7, 2) [indices (2,7)], (5,7) -> (7,5)[indices (5,8)]\n    *   Unchanged Pixels: All other non-zero pixels.\n    *   Rows Affected: Row 2 and 7, and 4 and 8.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Swapped Pairs: (0, 1) and (0,2) -> (0,2) and (0,1).\n    *   Unchanged Pixels: All other non-zero pixels.\n    *   Rows Affected: Row 0.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Swapped Pairs: (1, 5) -> (5, 1), which is 4 and 7 in the given grid.\n    *   Unchanged Pixels: All other non-zero pixels.\n    *   Rows Affected: Row 1.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Swapped Pairs: (1, 2) -> (2, 1), which is 1 and 8, and (3,4) -> (4,3), which is 4 and 7\n    *   Unchanged Pixels: All other non-zero pixels.\n    *   Rows Affected: Row 1 and 3.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

A swap occurs based on these conditions between objects at `(row, col1)` and `(row, col2)` where `col1 < col2`:\n      *   If there are two objects in the given row, and their column positions relative to each other switch in output, the swap is performed between objects at position `(row, col1)` and `(row, col2)`.\n      *   If there are more than two objects, find the matching pair which needs to be swapped based on the relative change in the column indices.\n\n4.  **Output:** Create an output grid, initially a copy of the input grid. Perform the identified swaps on the output grid. Pixels not involved in a swap remain in their original positions.\n\nThe most crucial update here is the \"Conditional Swap\" section.
