"""
The input grid contains one or more colored (non-black) pixels. These pixels are replicated in the output grid, maintaining their original color. The replication follows a specific pattern: the original pixel position is maintained, and a second copy is placed halfway across the output grid horizontally. If the output grid is taller than wide, additional copies are made below the originals. Azure (8) pixels are added to fill in a specific pattern, primarily in the even-numbered rows and columns, forming a border-like structure. The output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code performs reasonably well, capturing the core concept of doubling the grid size and replicating colored pixels. However, there are errors in the placement of the replicated pixels and the application of the azure (8) border. The code sometimes misses replicating pixels in the correct second location and incorrectly places azure pixels. The strategy will be to:

1.  **Verify and correct pixel replication logic:** Ensure the replicated pixels are placed at the correct offset (half the width of the *output* grid) and replicated correctly on additional rows when the output is taller.
2.  **Refine azure border logic:** The current logic places azure pixels only at even row and column indices. Examine the examples carefully to determine the precise rule for azure pixel placement. It's not a simple even/even rule.

**Gather Metrics and Information**

I'll use manual inspection and analysis to understand and describe the errors, no need to calculate exact coordinate differences right now. I will create a YAML block and a natural language program after analyzing the examples and the results, then move on to coding.

**Example Analysis**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 5x3, Output: 10x6. Two yellow (4) pixels.
    *   Error: Incorrect azure placement and incorrect secondary yellow placement
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 3x4, Output: 6x8. Two magenta (6) pixels.
    *   Error: Incorrect azure placement and incorrect secondary magenta placement
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 4x4, Output: 8x8. One red (2) pixel.
    *   Correct.
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: 2x4, Output: 4x8. One gray (5) pixel.
    *    Correct

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - dimensions: [rows, cols]

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - dimensions: [2 * input_rows, 2 * input_cols]

  - name: colored_pixel

      - color: non-zero
      - original_location: [row, col]  # In input_grid
      - replicated_locations: [[row, col + output_cols / 2], [row+ input_rows, col], [row + input_rows, col + output_cols/2]] #potential locations

  - name: azure_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: 8
      - location: [row, col]

actions:
  - name: replicate_grid
    description: Double the dimensions of the input grid to create the output grid.

  - name: replicate_colored_pixels
    description:  Copy non-black pixels to their original location and a horizontally offset location in output. Copy to additional rows if output is taller.

  - name: add_azure_border
    description: Fill specific empty cells with azure (8) pixels, seemingly creating an irregular border.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double Grid Size:** The output grid's dimensions are twice the input grid's dimensions (rows and columns).

2.  **Replicate Colored Pixels:** Any colored (non-black) pixel in the input grid is copied to the output grid.
    *   The pixel's original row and column position is maintained in the output grid.
    *    A second copy of the pixel is placed in the same row, but its new column is the original column plus half the *output* grid's width.
    *   If output grid is taller than wide (more rows than input grid), additional copies are made:
        *   The row is increased of the amount of the input rows.
        *   Both locations are replicated in the additional rows.

3.  **Add Azure Border:** After replicating pixels, fill some of the remaining empty (black, value 0) cells in the output grid with azure (value 8) pixels. The azure pixels appear to form an irregular border, not strictly on even rows and columns. Azure is placed in the first column and first row only if the cell is still black, and is placed intermittently throughout.

Based on the examples, there seems to be a pattern.
In even columns, the azure appears every other row starting from 0.
In odd columns the pattern is not obvious.
