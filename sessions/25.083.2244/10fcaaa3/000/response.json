There's an introduction of azure (8) pixels in a seemingly patterned way around and between the original color.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve two main actions:\n    1.  Replicating the input colored pixel multiple times in the output, maintaining its original color.\n    2.  Adding azure (8) pixels, possibly as a border or fill around the replicated colored pixels.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts**\n\n"

The column count appears double the input column count, based on the observed padding and replication pattern.\n\n"
