Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements of the Task**

*   **Input Grids:** The input grids appear to be smaller and contain a single non-zero colored pixel (object) amongst a background of black (0) pixels.
*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are larger, generally, and seem to expand upon or replicate the input grid's colored pixel. There's an introduction of azure (8) pixels in a seemingly patterned way around and between the original color.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve two main actions:
    1.  Replicating the input colored pixel multiple times in the output, maintaining its original color.
    2.  Adding azure (8) pixels, possibly as a border or fill around the replicated colored pixels.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: colored_pixel
    properties:
      color: varies (yellow, magenta, red, grey) # non-black
      shape: single pixel
    actions:
      - replicated: "The colored pixel from the input is copied multiple times in the output."
    relationships:
      - to_background: "The colored pixel is surrounded by black (0) pixels in the input."
      - to_azure: "Azure (8) pixels appear to be added around or adjacent to the replicated colored pixels in the output."
  - object: azure_pixel
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      shape: single_pixel
    actions:
     - added: "Azure pixels are not present in the input, but introduced in the output according to a pattern"
    relationships:
      - to_colored_pixel: " forms a border/filler around and between replications of the colored_pixel"
  - grid: input_grid
    properties:
      size: variable, smaller
      content: "Contains a single colored pixel and black background."
  - grid: output_grid
    properties:
      size: variable, larger
      content: "Contains replicated colored pixels and introduced azure pixels."
  - transformation_rule: replication_and_bordering
    description: "The input colored pixel is replicated, and azure pixels are added to create a pattern"

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the colored pixel:** Find the single non-black pixel in the input grid. Note its color.
2.  **Replicate with Padding:** In the output grid:
    *   The colored pixel will be copied in several locations
    *   The replication will be in the same columns as the input
    *   The rows increase with padding of rows of all azure, and mixed rows with azure in the column of the padding.
3.  **Add Azure Borders:** All odd rows will have azure in all odd columns.
4.  **Output Dimensions**: Output rows will be double the input rows + any additional padding. The column count appears double the input column count, based on the observed padding and replication pattern.
