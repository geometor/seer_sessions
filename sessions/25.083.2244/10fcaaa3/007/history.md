The input grid contains one or more colored (non-black) pixels. These pixels are replicated in the output grid, maintaining their original color. The replication follows a specific pattern: the original pixel position is maintained, and a second copy is placed halfway across the output grid horizontally. If the output grid is taller than wide, additional copies are made below the originals. Azure (8) pixels are added to fill in a specific pattern, primarily in the even-numbered rows and columns, forming a border-like structure. The output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code captures some key aspects of the transformation: doubling the grid size, replicating colored pixels, and attempting to add an azure border. However, the azure border logic is incorrect, and the replication logic doesn't fully match all examples. The main issues are the inconsistent placement of the azure pixels and the handling of the additional copies of colored pixels. The strategy will be to correct the azure border logic based on all examples and adjust the replication logic.

**Gather Metrics:**

I'll use code execution to check the input and output grid sizes and confirm observations.



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

# Input and Expected Output Grids from the examples
example_data = [
    {
        "input": np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0]]),

    expected_shape = example["expected"].shape
    print(f"Example {i+1}: Input Shape: {input_shape}, Expected Output Shape: {expected_shape}")

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: variable (rows, cols)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: (2 * input_rows, 2 * input_cols)

  - name: colored_pixels
    type: list of tuples
    properties:
      - elements: (row, col, color) - coordinates and color of non-black pixels

actions:
  - name: replicate_pixels
    description: Copy colored pixels from input to output grid.
    rules:
      - Maintain original position.
      - Create a second copy horizontally offset by half the output grid width.

  - name: add_azure_border
    description: Fill specific cells in the output grid with azure (8).
    rules:
      - If a cell in output is empty (value is 0), fill the pixel if the row or
        column is even, and under certain conditions the row + column mod 2 = 0
        is also a condition.
      - Reviewing the patterns, the correct rule appears to be that every other
        column and row is checked to ensure we don't fill a pixel that
        contains a value copied over from the input

  - name: double_grid_size
    description: The output grid's dimensions are twice the input grid's dimensions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double Grid Size:** Create an output grid with dimensions double that of the input grid (twice the rows and twice the columns).

2.  **Identify Colored Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are not black (0). Note their coordinates (row, column) and color value.

3.  **Replicate Colored Pixels:** For each colored pixel:
    *   Copy the pixel to the same position in the output grid.
    *   Copy the pixel to a second location in the output grid. This second location is horizontally offset by half the width of the *output* grid.

4. **Vertical Replication (Conditional):**
   - if output grid is taller than wide, replicate color pixels vertically by
     input.height

5.  **Add Azure Border:** Iterate through every cell of the output grid.
    - if the cell is empty (value is 0)
      - Fill it with azure (8) under these conditions:
        - If the current column index is even, then if the row is even, fill
        - If the current column index is odd, don't fill the current cell.

The prior natural language description was mostly accurate, but didn't
adequately account for filling empty space. The current rule for adding Azure
is more accurate and describes the examples better. The rule for vertical replication was added to better cover example 1.
