1. Find the Mirroring Axis: Identify the row index of the horizontal line composed entirely of yellow (color 4) pixels. This line serves as the axis of symmetry.

2. Localized Mirrored Color Shift:
    * Iterate through each column of the grid.
    * If a pixel above the yellow line is color 1 change the colors below.
    * Color 1 above is replace with color 7.
    * If color 1 is directly below the yellow line changes to color 3.
    * If color 1 is two rows below the yellow line changes to color 2.
    * If Color 1 is three rows below the yellow line changes to color 6.
    * Do not mirror any colors other than color 1.
