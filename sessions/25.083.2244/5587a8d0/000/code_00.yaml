facts:
  - observation: Input grids are rectangular and contain various colors.
  - observation: Output grids are rectangular and contain a subset of colors from the input, or have colors that are related or derived in some way from colors found in the input grid.
  - observation: Output grid dimensions are smaller than input grid dimensions.
  - object: input_grid, type: grid, description: The original grid of pixels.
  - object: output_grid, type: grid, description: The transformed grid of pixels.
  - object: border, type: color, description: A color that consistently frames an inner part of the image in the input grid. In train_1, this color is 7, train_2 the border color is 7, and in train_3 the border color is 7.
  - object: core, type: subgrid, description: The central region of the input grid, defined by the border.
  - action: extract_core, description: Isolates the core subgrid from the input grid.
  - action: transform_colors, description: Maps colors from the input core to new colors in the output core.
  - relationship: border_defines_core, description: The border color defines the boundary of the core subgrid.
  - relationship: core_transforms_to_output, description: The core subgrid, after color transformation, becomes the output grid.
  - transformation: train_1, input_border: 7, output_border: 4, core_color_change: 4 -> 6.
  - transformation: train_2, input_border: 7, output_border: 1, core_color_change: 8 -> 8, 5 -> 5, 1-> 8.
  - transformation: train_3, input_border: 7, output_border: 8, core_color_change: 8->0, 3 ->3, 9 -> 3, 7->0.
