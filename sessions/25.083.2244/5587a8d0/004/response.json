            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy to refine the natural language program and address the observed errors:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code attempted a reasonable approach: identifying a border, extracting a core, and transforming the core's colors based on a mapping. However, the results clearly show that this approach is too simplistic and doesn't generalize across the examples. The core extraction and color mapping logic are not robust enough. Specifically, the sizes are often incorrect and the colors are incorrectly mapped.\n\nThe key strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate Border Identification:** The current border identification assumes a single, uniform border. The examples show this isn't always true (e.g., Example 3 has a partial border of 0s inside a border of 7s). We need a more flexible way to define \"border.\"\n2.  **Improve Core Extraction:** Related to border identification, core extraction needs to handle cases where the border isn't a simple frame. It might involve identifying connected components or looking for patterns rather than just rows/columns of the same color.\n3.  **Refine Color Mapping:** The color mapping is currently very specific to each example and hardcoded. We need to derive a more general rule or algorithm for how colors are transformed, possibly based on relative positions, adjacency, or other properties. The output border color rule is flawed.\n4. **Size is a critical error:** The output dimensions are sometimes calculated wrong.\n5. **Focus on relationships:** The relationships between input and output colors is critical to solve this task\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution when possible):**\n\nLet's analyze each example in more detail. I'll use `tool_code` to print the input, expected, and received grids, their shape and their flattened color representation for easy diff-ing.\n\n"

In Example 3, this is the region of 0s.\n\n4.  **Identify the \"Core\".** The core is the region enclosed by the outer border and any inner border.\n\n5.  **Determine Output Grid Size.** The output dimensions will match the dimensions of the combined \"core\" and inner border (if any).\n\n6.  **Transform Colors in the core based on these rules:**\n\n    *   **Example 1:** If input border color is 7 and core colors are 4 and 6: Change 4 to 6, remove 7s, and change outer border 7s to 4s.\n    *   **Example 2:** If input border color is 7 and core colors are 1, 8, and 5: Change 8 to 8, 5 to 5, 1 to 8, and 7 to 1\n    *   **Example 3:** If input border is 7, and core colors are 8, 3, 9, and an inner border of 0 is present, then: Change 7 to 8. Internal colors transform according to rule: 8->0, 9->3, 3 is unchanged, and inner border 0 remains.\n\n7.  **Construct Output Grid.** Create a new grid with the determined output dimensions. Fill the border with the output border color. Fill the core area with the transformed core colors, aligning it with the original core's position.\n\n8.  **Inner Border Preservation**: Inner borders, are *not* transformed.\n\nThe most critical update is handling the *inner border* concept and using that in the mapping and output construction. The core transformation rules are still very example-specific, and we haven't found a generalizable pattern for the color changes themselves. The output grid size logic is clarified to account for the presence of inner borders.\n"
