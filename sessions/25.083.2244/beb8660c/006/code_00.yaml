facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain horizontal line segments of varying lengths and colors.
      Each segment consists of one or more adjacent pixels of the same non-zero color.
  - object: Horizontal line segment
    properties:
      - color: Integer (1-9) representing the color of the segment.
      - length: Integer representing the number of pixels in the segment.
      - row_index: Integer representing the row in the input grid where the segment starts.
      - x_offset: Integer representing the column in the input grid where the segment starts.
  - action: Reorder and stack
    description: |
      The horizontal line segments are extracted from the input grid.
      They are then placed in the output grid, starting from the bottom row and
      working upwards. The original x-offset of each segment is preserved.
      If stacking the reordered segments exceeds the original input grid height,
      the output grid is enlarged vertically *from the top*.  The output
      maintains each segment's internal integrity (color and length).
  - constraint: |
      The output grid size should match the expected output size.
