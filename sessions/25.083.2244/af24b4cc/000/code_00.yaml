objects:
  - type: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x10
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - description: Contains multiple colored regions, separated by 0 (white)
  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x5
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - description: Smaller grid containing a selection of colors from the input_grid.
  - type: color_blocks
    properties:
      - colors: various (1-9)
      - shape: contiguous blocks of the same color
      - location: input grid row, and range of cols
    behavior:
      - input grid blocks are selected and some transferred to output grid

relationships:
  - type: selection
    description: Specific colored pixels from the input grid are selected.
  - type: arrangement
    description: Selected pixels are arranged in a specific order and size within the output grid.
  - type: reduction
    description: The overall grid size is reduced, and many of the input grid blocks are removed.

actions:
  - select_columns: Four specific columns from the input_grid are selected.
  - extract_pixels: A single pixel from each selected column (from specific row) is extracted.
  - position: Each pixel is moved to the output grid at a specific row and column, overwriting anything already there.
