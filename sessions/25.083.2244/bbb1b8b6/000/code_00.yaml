facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - characteristic_column_1:  Always present, vertical, color blue (1), leftmost side
      - characteristic_column_2:  Always present, vertical, color gray (5), position varies
      - transform_region:  region to the right of the gray (5) pixels

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - width: 4
      - characteristic_column_1: Always present, vertical, color blue(1), leftmost side
      - content: derived from a transformation of the input_grid

  - actions:
    - name: transform_region
      description: The region to the right of the gray column in the input is extracted.
    - name: move_and_map
      description:  Move the transformed region to the output grid next to the left blue pixels
    - name: set_width
      description: The output width is always 4

  - relationships:
    - input_grid to output_grid: transformation based on color region extraction, moving, and mapping
    - transform_region location: always located to the right of the gray (5) vertical line.
