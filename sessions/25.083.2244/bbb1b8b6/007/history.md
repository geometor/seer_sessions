```python
"""
1.  **Find Key Lines:** Identify the leftmost vertical blue line (color 1) and the leftmost vertical gray line (color 5) within the input grid. Note their x-coordinates. If a blue line is not found, record its position as -1.

2.  **Extract Transform Region:** Extract the rectangular region of the input grid located immediately to the right of the gray line. This is the "transform region."

3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid with the same height as the input grid and a fixed width of 4.

4.  **Copy Transform Region to output:**
    *   If a blue line *was* found at x=0 of input:
        *    Copy up to 4 columns from the "transform region" to the output grid, *starting at column 1* of the output grid.
    *  If a blue line *was not* found at x = 0 of input:
        *   Copy up to 4 columns from the "transform region" to the output grid, *starting at column 0*.

5.  **Fill Remaining Columns:** If the copied transform region did not fill 4 columns:
     *  If blue line *was* at x = 0:
          *   Repeat the columns *between* the blue and gray line.
          *   If no columns are between the blue and gray lines, repeat the blue line.
     *   If a blue line exists, but *was not* at x=0:
          *   Repeat the columns *between* the blue and gray lines.
     *   If no blue line exists, do not fill.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and subsequently the code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and resulting code were too narrowly focused on the first training example. The code fails to correctly transform the majority of the provided examples. The core issue revolves around an incorrect assumption about how to determine where the output will take color information, it isn't just to the right of the gray. Also, the fill logic needs work. The most glaring error across all failing examples is that the output often starts with black (0) when it should start with other colors present in the input at the beginning of a row. It seems there are two separate operations that combine for the overall output.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine all Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* provided input/output pairs, not just the first one. Look for common patterns and operations across *all* of them.
2.  **Object Identification and Actions:** Focus on clearly identifying the "objects" (in this case, likely contiguous regions of color or specific lines) and how they are manipulated (copied, moved, repeated, etc.).
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to be a *general* rule that applies to *all* examples, not just a specific case. It might be necessary to break down the transformation into smaller, more modular steps.
4.  **YAML Fact Base:** Create a YAML-formatted fact base that captures key observations in a structured way.
5. Re-code.

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (using `tool_code`):**

Since I can't directly execute code and analyze outputs here (as I'm in a "dreamer" role), I would normally use tool execution to get metrics on color usage. However, the provided output includes helpful metrics. The most important points are:

*   **Consistent Size:** The output grid *always* has a height equal to the input grid's height and a width of 4. This is consistent.
*   **Inconsistent Color Palette/Count:** The color palette and counts are frequently incorrect. This points to problems with the object selection and copying/filling logic.
* **Pixel Off Count:** Every example has double digit pixel counts off. This is expected at this stage.

**YAML Fact Base:**

  - observations:
      - example_1: "output takes data on right side of gray, repeats columns between blue and gray on left"
      - example_2: "output takes data on right side of gray, repeats columns between blue and gray on left"
      - example_3: "output takes data on right side of gray, repeats columns between blue and gray on left"
      - example_4: "output takes data on the right side of gray, and takes data on the left side of gray"
      - example_5: "output takes data on the right side of gray, repeats columns between blue and gray on left"
      - example_6: "output takes data on the right side of gray, repeats columns between blue and gray on left"
      - example_7: "output takes data on the right side of gray, and takes data on the left side of gray. Includes a blue line on the edge."
```


**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Key Lines:** Locate the leftmost vertical blue line (color 1) and the leftmost vertical gray line (color 5) in the input grid. Note their x-coordinates. If the blue line isn't found, its position is considered -1.

2.  **Output Grid Initialization:** Create an output grid with the same height as the input grid and a width of 4.

3.  **Copy Transform Region:**
    *   Locate the section to the right of the gray line.
    *    If a blue line *was* found at x=0 of input:
        *    Copy up to 4 columns from the transform region to the output grid, *starting at column 1* of the output grid.
    *   If a blue line *was not* found at x = 0 of input:
        *    Copy up to 4 columns from the transform region to the output grid, *starting at column 0*.

4.  **Fill Remaining Columns (if any):**
    *   If the blue line was found at x=0:
        *   If there are columns *between* the blue and gray lines, repeat those columns to fill the remaining space in the output grid.
        *   If there are *no* columns between the blue and gray lines, repeat the blue line itself.

    * If the blue line exists, but *was not* at x=0:
        *    If there are columns *between* the blue and gray lines, repeat those columns to fill the remaining space in the output grid.

    *   If no blue line was found, do not fill.
