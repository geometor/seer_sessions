The transformation seems to selectively add a '4' (yellow) pixel in the output grid based on the arrangement of other colored pixels in the input grid. The most obvious change occurs in the last row. It seems like objects composed of adjacent pixels of non-zero value are important.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
