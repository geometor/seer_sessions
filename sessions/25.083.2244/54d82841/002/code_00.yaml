facts:
  - task: "Place a yellow pixel at the bottom of a vertical line of same-colored pixels."
  - objects:
      - description: "Vertical lines of pixels of the same color"
        properties:
          - color: "Determined by the pixel values (1-9)"
          - length: "Number of contiguous pixels in the vertical line"
          - start_row: "Row index of the top-most pixel"
          - end_row: "Row index of the bottom-most pixel (excluding the added yellow pixel)"
          - column: "Column index of the line"
  - actions:
    - description: "Place a yellow pixel (value 4) at the bottom of the grid."
      preconditions:
        - "A vertical line object exists directly above the target position."
        - "The target position is the last row of the output grid."
      postconditions:
        - "A yellow pixel is added to the grid at the specified location."
  - constraints:
      - "Only one yellow pixel is added per vertical line object, even if the object spans multiple rows."
      - "Yellow pixel placement must be at the last row index of the grid."
      - "The yellow pixel is only placed if the object above is a vertical line of a single, consistent color."
