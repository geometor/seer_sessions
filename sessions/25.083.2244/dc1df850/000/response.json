Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of varying sizes.\n*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color.\n*   The transformation seems to involve adding, changing, or moving some colored pixels based on their original positions and colors.\n*   The color blue (1) seems to play an important role. I see it added in all the examples.\n*   There appears to be a concept of an \"object\", based on our objectness priors.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
