Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment:**

The initial strategy of surrounding non-white pixels with a 3x3 square of blue pixels was partially correct. However, the code over-generates blue pixels, extending them even when the original non-white pixels are close to each other or near the edges, leading to extra blue pixels and shape mismatches. The code does correctly identify locations, but it needs better handling of shape and it connects nearby objects by extending the surrounding blue pixels. Example 3 works because only a single, isolated object is present.

**Strategy for Improvement:**

The improved natural language program and the code need to refine the "surrounding" logic. Instead of blindly creating a 3x3 blue square around *every* non-white pixel, It should recognize that the intent is to produce 3 x 3 block of blue, with the source non-white pixel at the center, *only* if the non-white pixel can support one, i.e. there are pixels above, below and at either side.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's analyze each example individually using code execution to get precise information:

**Example 1:**

**Example 3:**

Example 3 is already reported as correct, so no additional tool use is necessary.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - description: "Non-white pixels in the input grid are identified."
    objects:
      - name: non_white_pixel
        properties:
          color: "Not white (0)"
          shape: "Single pixel"
  - description: "A 3x3 block centered on the source pixel with value 1(blue) replaces non-white pixels, when possible"
    objects:
      - name: "blue_block"
        properties:
            color: "Blue (1)"
            shape: "3x3 square, centered around source pixel"
  - description: if a pixel is on the edge and cannot support a 3 x 3, the source pixel is unchanged
    action: replace
      

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Iterate through the input grid and find pixels that are not white (color value not equal to 0).
2.  **Conditional 3x3 Block Replacement:** For each target pixel found:
    *   Check that the identified pixel is not located on the edge, such that a 3 x 3 block cannot be created.
    *   If not on an edge, replace the 3 x 3 area centered on the target pixel with blue (1)
    *   Otherwise, copy the value from the input
3.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.
