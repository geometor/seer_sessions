"""
The transformation rule involves identifying non-white pixels in the input grid. If a non-white pixel is not on an edge,
it's replaced by a 3x3 block of blue (1) pixels centered on the original pixel's location. If the pixel IS on an edge
and a 3x3 block cannot be placed, the original value is copied unchanged.
