Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and try to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of varying sizes.
*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color.
*   The transformation seems to involve adding, changing, or moving some colored pixels based on their original positions and colors.
*   The color blue (1) seems to play an important role. I see it added in all the examples.
*   There appears to be a concept of an "object", based on our objectness priors.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain various colored pixels, with '0' (white) being the most common.
  - objects:
    - Single-color pixels are considered individual objects
    - There are no multi-pixel objects
  - properties:
      - color: Each pixel has a color, represented by a digit (0-9).
      - position: Each pixel has a row and column position in the grid.
  - actions:
      - Added: Some pixels, particularly blue ones (color 1), are added around existing pixels.
  - relationships:
      - proximity: The addition of blue pixels seems related to the proximity of non-white pixels.
      - clustering: Blue pixels are added in a clustering fashion.
  - constraints:
      - output_dimensions: the dimension of the output grid is the same as the dimension of the input grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **Identify** "target pixels", any input pixel that is not white (0).
3.  For each target pixel:

    *   If it is not white, add blue pixels around it.
    *   If it is not adjacent (8-connected) to a blue pixel.
        *   Make it adjacent to the target pixel by filling in white pixels
        *   Fill any remaining spaces around the target pixel and the added blue pixels to form a 3x3 square, centered on the target pixel.
4.  **Preserve** the original non-white pixels in their original locations in the output grid.
5. Output pixels that do not meet the criteria for adding blue remain unchanged.

I will keep this information for the next coding phase.
