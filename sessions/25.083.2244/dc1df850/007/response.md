1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Scan the input grid to identify all "target pixels," which are any pixels with a non-white color (value not equal to 0).

2.  **Conditional 3x3 Expansion:** For *each* target pixel:
    *   **Boundary Check:** Determine if a 3x3 block, centered on the target pixel, can be placed entirely within the grid boundaries.
    *   **Expansion:** If the 3x3 block fits within the bounds, perform the following steps:
        1.  Create a 3x3 block of blue (value 1) pixels.
        2.  Place this blue block on the output grid, centered at the target pixel's original location.
        3.  Replace the center pixel of the newly placed 3 x 3 block (i.e. original target pixel location) with the original color of the target pixel.
    * **No Expansion:** If the 3x3 block would extend beyond the grid boundaries, *retain the original pixel value unchanged at that location*.

3. **Preserve other non-white pixels:** Ensure existing non-white values are kept and only replaced by blue within a 3x3 block.
