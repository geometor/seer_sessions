1.  **Identify all objects:** Find all contiguous regions of non-zero pixels. Each region is an object, identified by its color.
2.  **Identify the target object:** The target object's color is the only color that is present in both in the input and output grids.
3. **Construct Output**: Create a new grid containing only the pixels where the target object was present in the input grid.
4. **Remove empty rows and columns**: Remove all rows and columns of the output grid that contain only 0's (black pixels).
