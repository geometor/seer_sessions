The transformation appears to involve isolating a contiguous block of non-zero pixels and potentially cropping or adjusting its shape and values. The background (value 0) is consistently removed, and the output grid dimensions are smaller than the input grid dimensions, containing only the extracted object. The extracted shape doesn't appear consistently. Sometimes, the shape in input is mirrored in output, but most of the time it is not.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
