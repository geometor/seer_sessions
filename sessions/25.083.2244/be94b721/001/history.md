Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perceiving the transformation logic and creating a structured description:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves identifying a specific object within the input grid and extracting a transformed version of it to the output grid. The transformation appears to involve isolating a contiguous block of non-zero pixels and potentially cropping or adjusting its shape and values. The background (value 0) is consistently removed, and the output grid dimensions are smaller than the input grid dimensions, containing only the extracted object. The extracted shape doesn't appear consistently. Sometimes, the shape in input is mirrored in output, but most of the time it is not.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Output grids contain a single connected object.
  - observation: The background color (0) is always removed.
  - observation: The extracted object is non-zero pixels in input.
  - observation: In train_1, the azure object is selected and reshaped.
  - observation: In train_2, the yellow object is selected.
  - observation: In train_3, the red object is selected and reshaped.
  - observation: In train_4, the red object is selected and reshaped.
  - hypothesis: The transformation selects a single object based on its color and may reshape.
  - hypothesis: If an object of same color appears multiple times, the rightmost object is selected.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Object:** Scan the input grid to find the rightmost object.
    The color can be decided by getting the color that are not black/background.
    It should be positioned at the right of any other color.

2. **Extract:** Create an output by printing the selected pixels on a black background.
    Reshape by counting row and columns of the selected object.

3.  **Output:** The resulting cropped and potentially reshaped object is the output.
