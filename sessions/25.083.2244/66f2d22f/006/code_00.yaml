facts:
  - description: "The output grid is always 4x7."
    type: "grid_size"
    value: [4, 7]

  - description: "The output grid is initialized with all white pixels (0)."
    type: "initialization"
    value: 0

  - description: "A diagonal line of gray (5) pixels is created in the output grid."
    type: "object"
    color: 5
    shape: "diagonal"

  - description: "The diagonal's characteristics depend on the relative positions of green and red pixels in the input grid."
    type: "rule"

  - description: "In Example 1, the diagonal starts near the right edge and extends downwards and to the left."
    type: "observation"
    example: 1

  - description: "In Example 2, the diagonal seems to wrap around the grid, appearing in two parts."
    type: "observation"
    example: 2

  - description: "In Example 3, the diagonal also appears to wrap and has elements extending in multiple directions."
     type: "observation"
     example: 3

  - description: "In Example 4, the diagonal appears to have a negative slope component and a 'wrapping' behavior."
    type: "observation"
    example: 4
  - description: "If a red pixel in the input coincides with the location of a gray pixel in the output diagonal, the red pixel is replaced with gray in the output."
    type: "conditional_replacement"
    condition: "overlap"
    input_color: 2
    output_color: 5
