            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the azure (8) line as a separator and attempts to extract colored pixels above and below it. However, it fails to accurately reconstruct the output grid. The primary issues are:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Column-wise Extraction:** The `extract_colored_columns` function only captures the *existence* of colored pixels in a column, not their spatial relationship within the column. It discards the relative positions, leading to all pixels from a column being placed at incorrect position.\n2.  **Incorrect Output Grid Construction:** The code attempts to populate the output grid by adding the elements of the column one after the other. There are the following errors:\n     a. It misinterprets how colors from different columns should be combined and placed. It stacks pixels from top section and then stacks pixels form bottom section without considering how columns should map.\n     b. It doesn't correctly handle the concatenation of top and bottom sections, particularly with respect to spacing/padding between columns.\n     c. The sizes of the output array are not computed correctly.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Revised Column Extraction:** Instead of simply storing colored pixels, we need to preserve their original row indices *relative to the section (top/bottom)*. This will allow us to reconstruct the spatial arrangement.\n2.  **Improved Grid Construction:** The output grid should be built by carefully merging the processed top and bottom sections. Instead of just concatenating we need to align based on colored columns.\n3.  **Accurate Size Calculation**: Compute the size of the output array by looking and top and bottom arrays and identifying the bounding box of colored objects.\n4. **YAML and Natural Language program**: Update the documentation.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection - code execution is not strictly necessary for this level of observation):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 9x9\n    *   Expected Output: 6x6\n    *   Actual Output: 35x6.\n    *   Observations: The code is missing the 2's in the first output row, the arrangement is wrong and the dimensions are completely wrong\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 9x9\n    *   Expected Output: 6x6\n    *   Actual Output: 40x6.\n        *   Observations: The code is missing the 2's and 4's in the first and third rows of the correct output. the arrangement is wrong and the dimensions are completely wrong.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 9x9\n    *   Expected Output: 6x6\n    *   Actual Output: 17 x 6\n        *   Observations: The code is missing the 2's and 4's in the first row of the output, the arrangement is wrong and the dimensions are completely wrong\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
