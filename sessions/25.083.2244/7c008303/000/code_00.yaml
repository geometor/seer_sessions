facts:
  - observation: "Input grids are larger than output grids."
  - observation: "A horizontal line of azure (8) pixels spans the entire width of each input grid."
  - observation: "This azure line divides the input grid into two distinct regions: above and below."
  - observation: "The output grid seems to be a compressed composite of specific regions from the input."
  - observation: "Colors in the output grid are the same as the input grid."
  - observation: "Colors seem to maintain their relative positions from the input, but whitespace is changed and some color blocks are ignored"
  - observation: "The columns in the input containing color values above the azure line are compressed, ignoring the azure and white cells and taking the color values and repeating them, if multiples"
  - observation: "The columns in the input containing color values below the azure line are compressed, ignoring the azure and white cells and taking the color values and repeating them, if multiples"
  - observation: "The top portion of the output grid contains the top of the input grid and the lower portion of the output grid is the bottom of the input grid"
  - observation: "The rows in the input grid above and below the azure line correspond in number to the rows in the output grid."
