The most prominent element is the change in color of specific 'azure' (8) pixels in the input grid. The spatial arrangement of the azure pixels and their surrounding context seems crucial to determining the new color in the output grid. There's no obvious global operation (like rotation, reflection, or simple color substitution). Instead, the transformation is local and context-dependent. Different azure colored clusters are changing into other colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
