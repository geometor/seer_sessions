            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the first coding attempt and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the core concept: finding azure (8) colored clusters and modifying specific pixels within them. However, it fails to accurately determine the \"extrema\" pixels within *all* clusters, leading to incorrect color transformations. The primary issue is that the `get_cluster_extrema` function simply finds the min/max row and min/max col, which are indeed the top-left, bottom-left, top-right and bottom-right pixels, but it doesn't handle the case where a cluster stretches and there are multiple min/max rows and cols. It doesn't account for cases where clusters can cause incorrect identification of these pixels.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Refine Extrema Identification:** The `get_cluster_extrema` function needs to be improved. Instead of directly using `min(rows)`, `max(rows)`, `min(cols)`, and `max(cols)`, it needs to find all pixels corresponding to the min/max row and find the min/max column among those to deal with non-rectangular, and diagonal shapes. The same is true for min/max columns, check multiple instances of them.\n\n2.  **Test-Driven Refinement:** We'll focus on correcting the issues revealed by the test examples, particularly addressing the discrepancies in pixel color transformations. We can iteratively adjust the `get_cluster_extrema` logic and use the existing test cases as immediate validation.\n\n**Metrics and Observations per Example (using visual inspection since code execution is limited to computation, not grid comparisons)**\n\n*Example 1*\n\n*   Input Shape: 7x7\n*   Expected Output Shape: 7x7\n*   Transformed Output Shape: 7x7\n*   Number of Azure Clusters (Expected): 2\n*   Number of Azure Clusters Identified (Actual): 2\n*   Issues:  The corners are not correctly selected\n\n*Example 2*\n\n*   Input Shape: 7x7\n*   Expected Output Shape: 7x7\n*   Transformed Output Shape: 7x7\n*   Number of Azure Clusters (Expected): 2\n*   Number of Azure Clusters Identified (Actual): 2\n*   Issues: The corners are not correctly selected\n\n*Example 3*\n\n*   Input Shape: 7x7\n*   Expected Output Shape: 7x7\n*   Transformed Output Shape: 7x7\n*   Number of Azure Clusters (Expected): 1\n*   Number of Azure Clusters Identified (Actual): 1\n*    Issues: The corners are not correctly selected\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
