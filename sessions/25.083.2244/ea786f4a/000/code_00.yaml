objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - values: single digit integers (0-9)
    observations:
      - Contains a single '0' pixel.
      - The rest of the pixels share the same color.

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input_grid
      - values: single digit integers (0-9)
    observations:
      - Contains pixels of the same color as input_grid, forming a '+' shape.
      - The center of the '+' is aligned with the '0' pixel in the input_grid.
      - All other pixels are '0'.

actions:
  - name: locate_center
    input: input_grid
    output: (row, col) coordinates of the '0' pixel
    description: Finds the row and column index of the single '0' pixel within the input grid.

  - name: create_cross
    input: input_grid, (row, col)
    output: output_grid
    description: Generates the output grid by preserving the input color only in the row and column that intersect at the input (row, col), setting all other pixels to '0'.

relationships:
  - input_grid and output_grid have the same dimensions.
  - The '0' pixel in input_grid determines the center of the '+' shape in output_grid.
