"""
The input grid contains objects composed of connected gray (5) pixels. These objects can be lines (straight or diagonal) or potentially other shapes.
The transformation rule changes some gray pixels to green (3) based on their connectivity to other gray pixels. Specifically, a gray pixel is changed to green if it has two gray neighbors that are diagonally positioned relative to each other (e.g., top-left and bottom-right, or top-right and bottom-left).
