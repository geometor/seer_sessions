Both grids seem to contain single-digit integers representing colors. The predominant colors are black (0) and gray (5), with green (3) appearing in the output grids. The positions of the gray (5) pixels mostly remain consistent between input and output, while some gray (5) pixels are replaced with green(3). It's crucial to identify the rule determining *which* gray pixels change to green.  A spatial relationship or pattern likely governs this transformation.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Initialize all cells in output grid to match the values in the input grid.\n2.  **Gray to Green Transformation:** For each grey (5) pixel in the *input* grid, perform a check:\n   * If, the gray pixel in the first column is changed to green.\n   * If gray pixel are in a diagonal direction, we change the the pixel in the other direction.\n   * If the first condition is not true, and the second conditions are met, change to color to green (3).\n3.  **Output:** The output grid now represents the transformed state.\n\nEssentially, the program copies the input grid, then selectively changes gray (5) pixels to green (3) based on their relationship to other gray pixels on the input grid.\n"
