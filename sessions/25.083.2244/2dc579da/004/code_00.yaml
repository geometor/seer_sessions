example1:
  input:
    objects:
      - shape: rectangle
        color: 4
        width: 7
        height: 3
      - shape: horizontal_line
        color: 2
        width: 7
        height: 1
    action: extract sub-grid above horizontal line
  output:
     objects:
      - shape: rectangle
        color: [4, 1]
        width: 3 # width of initial contiguous block of color 4
        height: 3

example2:
  input:
    objects:
      - shape: rectangle
        color: [8, 3]
        width: 5
        height: 2
      - shape: horizontal_line
        color: 3
        width: 5
        height: 1
    action: extract sub-grid above horizontal line
  output:
     objects:
      - shape: rectangle
        color: [8, 4]  # Note: the lower left most color *below* the line is included
        width: 2 # contiguous block of 8 at top of grid
        height: 2 # number of rows above line + the row below that has at least one cell adjacent to the line

example3:
  input:
    objects:
      - shape: rectangle
        color: [3, 8, 1]
        width: 11
        height: 5
      - shape: horizontal_line
        color: 1
        width: 11
        height: 1
    action: extract sub-grid above horizontal line
  output:
    objects:
      - shape: rectangle
        color: [3, 8]
        width: 5 # contiguous block of 3 at top of grid
        height: 5
