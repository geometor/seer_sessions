            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on observations from the first training example, focusing on preserving the '7's within each column. The results across the three examples show that this assumption holds. However, the transformation and reordering of the non-'7' elements are incorrect. The code currently just places the original non-'7' values back in their original order, which doesn't match the expected outputs. We need to discern a pattern in how these non-'7' elements are transformed and reordered *within each column*. The core challenge is to figure out the permutation logic applied to the non-'7' elements in each column, independently.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Column-wise Operations:** Reinforce the understanding that the transformation happens independently within each column.\n2.  **Analyze Non-7 Permutations:** For each example, and within each column, compare the order of non-'7' elements in the input and the expected output. Identify if there's a consistent sorting, shifting, or other permutation rule.\n3.  **Consider Input/Output Value Mapping:** Examine if the transformation involves a mapping between input and output values (e.g., 0 becomes 5, 1 becomes 8, etc.). Check if this mapping is consistent across columns and examples.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Start with the simplest possible permutation rules (like sorting) and test them. If simple rules fail, look for more complex patterns.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Analyze Examples:**\n\nI need to programmatically extract the non-'7' elements and their indices for each column in both the input and expected output grids. This will facilitate a direct comparison.\n\n"
