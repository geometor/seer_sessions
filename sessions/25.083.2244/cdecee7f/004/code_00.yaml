  - task: "Reorder non-zero pixels"
  - objects:
    - type: "pixel"
      properties:
        - color: "integer value (0-9)"
        - position: "(row, column) in original grid"
    - type: "grid"
      properties:
        - dimensions: "(rows, columns)"
        - content: "2D array of pixels"
  - actions:
    - name: "extract"
      description: "Identify and isolate non-zero pixels from the input grid."
    - name: "sort"
      description: "Order pixels based on their original position (row-major)."
    - name: "rearrange"
      description: "Place sorted pixels into a new grid based on specific rule."
      details: "The rearrangement rule involves sorting the non zero pixels by row and column and placing them into a new grid where the pixels are filled in from left to right and top to bottom, preserving the original relative positions as closely as possible within the constraints of the smaller, reshaped grid."
