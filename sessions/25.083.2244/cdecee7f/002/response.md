Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, and while it correctly extracts and sorts non-zero pixels, it doesn't arrange them in the expected output order. The core issue is the arrangement logic after sorting. The current code simply fills the output grid row by row. The examples show a consistent pattern, that's not row-major, it's more complex than that. My strategy is:

1.  **Analyze Pixel Order:** Carefully examine how the pixels are reordered in *all* examples, not just the first. Pay very close attention to the input coordinates and output positions. There appears to be a consistent spatial rearrangement that is maintained across all the examples.
2.  **Refine Arrangement Logic:** Instead of directly filling the `output_grid` row by row based on sorting, implement the identified spatial transformation rule.

**Gather Metrics and Observations**

I need to systematically analyze the input and output coordinates of the non-zero pixels. I'll use a `tool_code` block to compute the mapping. This is important as it's something I need to accurately model, and using python is best suited for this.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_pixel_movement(input_grid, output_grid):
    """Analyzes the movement of non-zero pixels."""
    input_pixels = []
    output_pixels = []
    for r in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for c in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            if input_grid[r, c] != 0:
                input_pixels.append(((r, c), input_grid[r, c]))
    for r in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for c in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            if output_grid[r, c] != 0:
                output_pixels.append(((r, c), output_grid[r, c]))

    # sort the input pixels for later comparison
    input_pixels = sorted(input_pixels, key=lambda item: (item[0][0], item[0][1]))
    # sort output pixels by color value to align with how input is processed.
    output_pixels = sorted(output_pixels, key=lambda item: item[1])
    
    movements = []

    for i_pix, o_pix in zip(input_pixels, output_pixels):
        movements.append((i_pix[1], i_pix[0], o_pix[0]))
    
    return movements

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Extract:** Identify all pixels in the input grid with a value other than 0. These are the "non-zero pixels."
2.  **Sort** Sort the pixels by their original position (row, col), this will act as a tie-breaker.
3. **Calculate Output Dimensions:** Count the number of non-zero pixels (`n`). Calculate the dimensions of the output grid to be as close to a square as possible.  The number of columns is the ceiling of the square root of `n`, and the number of rows is the ceiling of `n` divided by the number of columns.
4.  **Transform and Place:**  Iterate through the *sorted* non-zero pixels. Determine their new position in the output grid based on a specific transformation derived from input and output examples (See detailed analysis below) and fill output grid sequentially as a square.
5. **Fill Output Grid:** The sorted and transformed pixel values are then placed into a new grid of calculated dimensions. Fill remaining cells of grid with `0`.

**Detailed analysis of spatial transformation (from tool output)**

The transformation appears to apply a consistent rule to convert between the original location and the transformed location.

Based on the observed movements, it appears there is a spiral or diagonal like fill.

The method for placement is still unclear. It does not match a straightforward spiral, diagonal or row/column fill.

It appears we sort first, and place based on a calculated output size.
The placement in example 1 is:


```
3  4  2
9  6  8
5  x  x
```


The placement in example 2 is:


```
6 1 9
8 7 3
x x x
```


the placement in example 3 is:

```
9  5  3
3  1  1
2  4  5
```


I suspect a rotation or reflection.
