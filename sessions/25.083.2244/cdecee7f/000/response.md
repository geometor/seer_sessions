Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger, sparse grid (input) into a smaller, dense grid (output). The input grids primarily consist of 'white' (0) pixels, with a few scattered pixels of other colors. The output grid seems to be constructed from these non-white pixels, arranged in a specific order. The dimensions of the output grid are significantly smaller than the input.  It appears the relative positions of colored pixels might get changed. There's no obvious rotation or mirroring.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: large (rows x columns)
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - characteristic: mostly 0 (white), sparse non-zero pixels

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: smaller (rows x columns)
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - characteristic: dense, contains non-zero pixels from input_grid

  - name: non_zero_pixel
    type: element
    properties:
      - value: integer (1-9)
      - location: (row, column) in input_grid

actions:
  - name: extract
    description: Identify and isolate non-zero pixels from the input_grid.
  - name: arrange
    description: Position the extracted pixels into the output_grid.
  - name: compact
    description: Reduce grid dimensions to form a smaller, denser grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid *contains* many non_zero_pixels.
  - output_grid *is_formed_from* extracted non_zero_pixels.
  - output_grid *is_smaller_than* input_grid
  - action:extract *operates_on* input_grid
  - action: arrange *produces* output_grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Extraction:** Scan the input grid and identify all pixels with a value other than 0 (white).  Record the value (color) and original location (row, column) of each of these non-zero pixels.

2. **Ordering:** Sort extracted pixels using these rules:
      - First by input grid row position, ascending (top to bottom)
      - Then, for pixels within the same row, sort by their input grid column, ascending (left to right)
      - If on different rows, sort by column descending

3. **Construction:** Create a new, smaller output grid.
   - iterate through extracted pixel ordered list
   - fill output grid from top left with ordered list
   - arrange the sorted pixels into the output grid, filling it row by row, from left to right.
   - if row is full, start new row below
   - continue until list is finished

4.  **Padding:** (Implicit from the examples, although it doesn't happen in all cases)
    - if any output row is shorter than the longest row, pad it to right with zero

5. **Dimensioning:** The output grid dimensions will be automatically determined by the number of extracted pixels and the arrangement process. The final dimensions are such that all extracted pixels fit compactly, with minimal empty space.

The core logic seems to be extracting non-zero pixels, ordering them based on their original positions, and then arranging them compactly into a new grid.
