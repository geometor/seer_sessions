The input grids primarily consist of 'white' (0) pixels, with a few scattered pixels of other colors. The output grid seems to be constructed from these non-white pixels, arranged in a specific order. The dimensions of the output grid are significantly smaller than the input.  It appears the relative positions of colored pixels might get changed. There's no obvious rotation or mirroring.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

Record the value (color) and original location (row, column) of each of these non-zero pixels.\n\n2. **Ordering:** Sort extracted pixels using these rules:\n      - First by input grid row position, ascending (top to bottom)\n      - Then, for pixels within the same row, sort by their input grid column, ascending (left to right)\n      - If on different rows, sort by column descending\n\n3. **Construction:** Create a new, smaller output grid.\n   - iterate through extracted pixel ordered list\n   - fill output grid from top left with ordered list\n   - arrange the sorted pixels into the output grid, filling it row by row, from left to right.\n   - if row is full, start new row below\n   - continue until list is finished\n\n4.  **Padding:** (Implicit from the examples, although it doesn't happen in all cases)\n    - if any output row is shorter than the longest row, pad it to right with zero\n\n5. **Dimensioning:** The output grid dimensions will be automatically determined by the number of extracted pixels and the arrangement process. The final dimensions are such that all extracted pixels fit compactly, with minimal empty space.\n\nThe core logic seems to be extracting non-zero pixels, ordering them based on their original positions, and then arranging them compactly into a new grid.\n"
