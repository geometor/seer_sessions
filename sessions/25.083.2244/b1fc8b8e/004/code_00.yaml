observations:
  - task: "Create a simplified, bordered representation of the input."
  - input_output_relationship: "The output grid appears to be a 5x5 subgrid derived from the input grid"
  - size_consistency: "Output dimensions are consistently 5x5, Input dimension is consistently 6x6."
  - border: "the output grid has a repeating border"
  - colors: "The input grids use colors 0 and 8. Output grid uses colors 0 and 8"
  - color_mapping: "Colors in the input are preserved, but their positions change"
  - object_center: "The output grid has a black center"
  - input_shape: "Input has a solid or partially solid shape composed of color 8"
  - output_shape: "Output extracts the outer edge of the shape of the input, but leaves out corners and inverts the shape"
  - color_invariance: "Colors 0 and 8 are present in both input and output."
