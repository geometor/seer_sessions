      - object_id: input_grid
        shape: (8, 8)
        colors: [3, 7] # green, orange

        colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9] # all except 7
        notes: the output grid is always different, a full grid, the same as example two
    actions:
      - action_type: map_color
        agent: last_color # use the last appearing color in the input to map
