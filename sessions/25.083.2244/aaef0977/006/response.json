            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and formulate a plan to improve the transformation logic.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach uses a `grid_map` dictionary, keyed by the *last* unique color in the input grid, to determine the output pixel values. This approach worked perfectly for the first example, where the input grid contained both 7 (orange) and 3 (green). However, the first example shows that the output is the '7' grid from grid_map. The second example has an input with colors 7 and 5 and in the output color 5 is not in the output. From grid_map, the '7' entry would be used.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe current strategy is failing in the general case because it relies on the \"last\" color. Example 2 shows that although there is a 5 present in the Input, the corresponding grid from `grid_map` is not used, instead the grid for the last color, 7, is used. We need to use all colors, not just the last.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on aspects relevant to the transformation:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** 8x8 grid, colors present: [7, 3]\n*   **Output:** 8x8 grid, Matches grid\\_map\\[7]\n*    **grid\\_map selection:** Based on last color (7)\n*   **Result:** Perfect match.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** 8x8 grid, colors present: [7, 5]\n*    **Expected output:** 8 x 8 does not match any entries in grid\\_map.\n*    **grid\\_map selection:** should depend on the last color (5), but the transformed output is the grid for 7.\n*   **Result:** Mismatch. Suggests the logic needs to incorporate all of the colors not just the last.\n\nFact YAML:\n"
