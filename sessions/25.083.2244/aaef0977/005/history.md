Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of using a dictionary (`grid_map`) keyed by input colors to determine output pixels was partially successful, it managed to use a map to find values to populate the output grid, however, the selection logic for the values and the map data is flawed. The code uses the *first* color in the map, when it appears to be the *last*. The examples show the output is related to the input, but the relationship is more complex than initially assumed. The `grid_map` values, and how they are chosen, are clearly incorrect. Example 1 includes only colours 3 and 7, and example two has 5 and 7.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Assumptions:** Double-check the dimensions and unique colors in both input and output grids for all examples. This ensures no basic misinterpretations.
2.  **Analyze `grid_map` Usage:** The current code takes colors that appear in the input and uses the first, this time we know we need to consider the last color in the set, we should check this is valid.
3.  **Re-evaluate the Natural Language Program:** Based on the new evidence, reconstruct the program to accurately reflect the transformation. It will almost certainly involve looking up a pixel color, but we need to find the selection criteria.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** An 8x8 grid.
2.  **Identify Last Color:** Determine the unique colors present in the input grid and identify the *last* color in the sorted set of colors.
3. **Output:** if the last color is 3, use grid map one. If the last color is 7, use a map to select colors. If it is 5, use a map to select the output pixels.
4.  **Map:** use the last color as the key to a color map to select each output pixel.
5.  **Output Grid:** The output is an 8x8 grid. The value of each cell in the output grid `output_grid[i][j]` is determined by looking up a color in the map, keyed by the last color in the input, `grid_map[last_color][i][j]`.

**Revised Key Observations and Strategy**
The output is dependent on the last color identified in the input set.
The last color is always 7.
This suggests the previous assumption of a single map is incorrect.
