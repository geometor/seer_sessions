These lines can be either horizontal or vertical. The transformation involves replacing the cells *between* the endpoints of these lines with the color red (value 2).  Crucially, only cells *between* the line endpoints are changed. If a line consists of a single pixel, it's not modified. The background color white (value 0) does not form lines, so it doesn't trigger the transformation.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
