general_observations:
    - "All examples maintain a consistent 3x3 output size, even with a varying count of qualifying pixels. There is one color, 0 (white) in each output that is not present in the input, and the position depends on the number of pixels."
    - "The transformation extracts all pixels that are not 0 or 5."
    - "Extracted pixels are arranged sequentially into a smaller grid, filling row by row, from top-left."
    - "Rows and columns of the input grid that contain all zeros and are not included in the output grid."
