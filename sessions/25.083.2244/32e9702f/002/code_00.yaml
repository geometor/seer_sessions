facts:
  - description: "Zero pixels are always transformed to gray (5)."
    examples: [1, 2, 3]
  - description: "Non-zero pixels adjacent to a zero pixel (horizontally or vertically) are transformed to gray (5)."
    examples: [1, 2, 3]
  - description: "Non-zero pixels *not* adjacent to a zero pixel remain unchanged."

  - objects:
      - name: "Non-zero color blocks"
        properties:
          - color: "Varies (3, 4, or 7 in the examples)"
          - shape: "Contiguous blocks of the same color"
        transformations:
          - "Pixels at the edge adjacent to zeros become gray."
          - "Interior pixels remain the same color."
      - name: "Zero color background"
        properties:
