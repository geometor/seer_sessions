In some cases, the entire grid is a single object. In others, there are multiple objects.\n*   **Background:** The color '0' (white) often acts as a background, but not always (see train\\_2).\n*   **Changes:** The transformation seems to involve changing some, but not all, of the '0' pixels to '5' (gray). The non-zero pixels sometimes remain, and are sometimes changed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
