facts:
  - description: "Identify distinct objects in the input grid."
    details: "Each object is a contiguous block of non-zero pixels of the same color."
  - description: "Objects with same shape are considered as one pattern."
    details: "In each example, objects in input with same color and shape are arranged to create the output grid."
  - description: "Output grid combines transformed pattern."
    details: "The transformation rule is based on combining identified patterns."
  - example_1:
    - input:
      - object_1: {color: 4, shape: [[4, 0], [4, 4]]}
      - object_2: {color: 6, shape: [[6, 6, 6], [0, 6, 6], [0, 0, 6]]}
    - output: { combined_shape: [[6, 6, 6], [4, 6, 6], [4, 4, 6]]}
