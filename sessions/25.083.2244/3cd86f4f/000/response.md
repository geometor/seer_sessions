Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming an input grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into an output grid. The primary visual change appears to be the addition of a border of '0' (white) pixels around the original input grid. The size of the output grid grows relative to the input, expanding outwards. The original input grid is present and unchanged within the center of the output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - shape: variable (rows, cols)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - shape: (input_rows + y_border, input_cols + x_border)

  - name: border
    type: frame
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - thickness: variable

actions:
  - name: add_border
    description: Surrounds the input grid with a border of '0's.

relationships:
  - input_grid is contained within output_grid
  - output_grid dimensions are larger than input_grid dimensions

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Input Dimensions:** Get the number of rows and columns of the `input_grid`.
2.  **Calculate Output Dimensions**:
    *   The output grid should be at least 3x3.
    *   Iteratively add columns to the left and to the right,
        until the input grid is different from the central part of the current
        output.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, larger grid (`output_grid`) filled entirely with '0' (white) pixels, based on calculated output dimensions.
4.  **Embed Input:** Copy the `input_grid` into the center of the `output_grid`.
5. **Return:** return output grid.
