"""
The transformation rule is to prepend a variable number of columns filled with 0 (white) to the input array.
The output grid has the same number of rows as the input grid. The output grid's number of columns is 
determined by adding a variable number of columns to the left of the input. No padding is added to the rows,
top, bottom, or right of the array.
