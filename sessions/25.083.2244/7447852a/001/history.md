Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors observed are red (2) and white (0) in the input, with the addition of yellow (4) in the output. The transformation seems to involve a directional expansion or "filling" operation, specifically originating from red (2) pixels. The expansion appears to be bounded by other red pixels or the edge of the grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - red (2)
        - white (0)
        - yellow (4)
      position: [row, col]  # Row and column index
    behavior:
      - static: red
      - replaced: white becomes yellow

relations:
    - type: adjacency
      description:  Pixels are adjacent horizontally and vertically, and sometimes diagonally.
    - type: containment
      description: The grid contains all pixels.

actions:
  - type: fill
    agent: red pixel
    target: white pixel
    direction: horizontal and vertical, possibly combined
    condition: white pixel is between two red pixels on a row or a column.
    result: white pixel becomes yellow.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value '2' (red) within the input grid. These act as "source" pixels.

2.  **Horizontal and Vertical Scan for Filling** For each white (0) pixel, check its neighbors:
    * Check each row of the input grid for 3 values in this pattern: `2 0 2`.
    * If the pattern `2 0 2` exists, then the output grid at the location of `0` will be `4`.
    * Check each column of the input grid for 3 values in this pattern: `2 0 2`.
    * If the pattern `2 0 2` exists, then the output grid at the location of `0` will be `4`.

3. **Fill the output grid.** Construct the output grid such that every occurrence of 2 0 2 is replaced with 2 4 2, both across each row and down each column.

In essence, the transformation identifies enclosed '0's between '2's, either horizontally or vertically, and replaces the '0' with a '4'. The source '2' pixels do not change, they trigger the fill.
