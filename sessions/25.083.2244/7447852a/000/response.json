The primary colors observed are red (2) and white (0) in the input, with the addition of yellow (4) in the output. The transformation seems to involve a directional expansion or \"filling\" operation, specifically originating from red (2) pixels. The expansion appears to be bounded by other red pixels or the edge of the grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
