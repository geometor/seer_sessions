Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** The input consists of a rectangular grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. There are distinct objects formed by contiguous blocks of the same color.\n*   **Output:** The output is also a rectangular grid of single-digit integers. It appears to be an expanded version of the input, with a specific pattern of repetition and arrangement of the input colors. The output grid seems to be generated by inverting, mirroring, or repeating the input.\n*    The dimensions are different\n*    The objects of the same color are adjacent to each other, there are no gaps\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
