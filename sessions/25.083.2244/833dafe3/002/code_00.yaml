facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid is always a square, and its dimensions are double the dimensions of the input grid.
      Specifically, if the input is H x W, the output is (2*H) x (2*W).

  - example_1:
      input_colors: {0: 6, 3: 4, 4: 3, 6: 3} # color: count
      output_colors: {0: 24, 3: 16, 4: 12, 6: 12} # color: count
      input_shape: (4, 4)
      output_shape: (8, 8)
      relationship: |
          Each color count in the output is a multiple of its count in the input. The shape expands by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.
          The input grid appears to be replicated four times in a 2x2 arrangement to construct the output.
          The replication is such that it forms a 2x2 layout of the input.
          The center of the output grid is a 2x2 input replicate.
  - example_2:
      input_colors: {0: 3, 2: 1, 3: 3, 4: 2}
      output_colors: {0: 12, 2: 4, 3: 12, 4: 8}
      input_shape: (3, 3)
      output_shape: (6, 6)

  - general_rule: |
      The input grid is replicated four times to form a 2x2 grid in the output, forming a larger square.
