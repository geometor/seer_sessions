"""
The transformation involves downsampling the input grid to produce a smaller output grid. 
The process can be described as follows:

1.  Determine Output Dimensions: The dimensions of the output grid are determined based on training examples.
2.  Calculate Step Sizes: calculate a row_step and col_step that most closely divides the input by the desired output.
3.  Determine Starting Points: There appears to be multiple valid starting points. We must determine which starting points 
    reproduce the expected output grid based on calculated step sizes.
4.  Sample Pixels: Starting from a specific `row_start` and `col_start` indices in the input grid, select pixels at intervals 
    defined by `row_step` and `col_step`. These selected pixels form the output grid. The selection continues until `row_end` 
    and `col_end` are reached, or the boundaries of the input grid are encountered.

For example 1: The output grid consists of every pixel. The starting points are at row 1 and column 1 and steps are 1.
For example 2: The output grid samples pixels with both row and column step equal to 3. Start row and start column is at index 0.
