facts:
  - observation: Input and output are 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9).
  - observation: Integers represent colors.
  - observation: Output grid is smaller than input grid in both dimensions.
  - observation: Colors in the output grid are present in the input grid.
  - observation: Colors may appear multiple times in different areas of the grids
  - observation: "train_1" input is 6x6, output is 4x4.
  - observation: "train_1" output is created taking pixels from a sub-area of the input skipping the first and last row/column.
  - observation: "train_2" input is 16x16, output is 6x6.
  - observation: "train_2" seems to skip some rows/cols in the input to create the output
  - hypothesis: The transformation involves a specific sampling or downscaling of the input grid, retaining some original colors.
  - hypothesis: There will likely be consistent spacing or intervals used
