The output grid is always 9x9. The input grid appears to be replicated, tiled, or otherwise incorporated into the output grid in a specific pattern. Sometimes, black (0) padding is added to fill the rest of the 9x9 output grid.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves expanding the input grid into a larger, fixed-size (9x9) output grid. The rule for how the input grid is placed/expanded into the output grid varies between the different examples, but the output dimensions stay constant.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The input is either tiled to take up all of the space, only the top rows, or placed in the center and then tiled.\n"
