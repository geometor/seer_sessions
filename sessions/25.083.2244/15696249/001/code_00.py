"""
The transformation takes the input grid and places it into a 9 x 9 output grid, 
filling the rest with 0. The placement rule varies between examples:
1. Top-left corner, replicated three times horizontally and vertically.
2. Top-left corner, replicated three times vertically.
3. Top-left corner, replicated three times vertically.
4. Center (row 4, column 4), replicated three times horizontally and vertically.
