1.  **Copy First Row:** Copy the first row of the input grid directly to the first row of the output grid.

2.  **Transform Second Row:**
    *   Analyze the first row of the *input grid* and identify "runs" of consecutive pixels with the same color. Represent each run as a tuple: `(color, length)`.
    *   Initialize the second row of the output grid to all 7's.
    *   Iterate through the runs identified in the first row of the input.
        *   For the *first* input run: output a single pixel of color '7'.
        *   For subsequent input runs (index `i` > 0): output a run in the second row of the output grid, where:
           * The *length* of this run is determined by the length of the *previous* (i-1) run in the first row of the input.
           * The *color* of this run is the color of the *current* (i) run in the first row of the input.

3.  **Copy Remaining Rows (if any):** Copy any remaining rows (rows 3 and beyond) from the input grid directly to the output grid without modification.
