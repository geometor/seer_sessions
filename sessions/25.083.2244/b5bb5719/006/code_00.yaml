  - name: transform_row_2
    input: runs_row_1, output_grid
    description: >
      Transforms the second row of the output grid based on the runs in the
      first row of the input grid. The transformation starts by placing 7. The
      color of the following runs are from the current input run color. The
      length of a run in row two corresponds to the length of the preceding run in row one.
