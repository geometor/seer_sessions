1.  **Copy** the first row of the input grid directly to the first row of the output grid.
2.  **Transform Row 2**:
    *   Examine the runs of colors in the first row of the *input grid*, represented as (color, length) tuples.
    *   Initialize the second row of the output grid with the same values as the second row of the input grid (all 7's in the examples provided).
    *   Iterate through the identified runs in the first row. For each run, iterate a number of elements equal to the previous run's length minus 1.
    *   If current index > 0:
    *       If the next run color is different than the current run, the element in output_grid[1][index] = the color of the current run.
    *       else the color of the next run is the same as current run - output_grid[1][index] remains the color of the previous run.
3.  **Copy Remaining Rows**: Copy all rows from the input grid to the output grid, besides row 2, without changes.
