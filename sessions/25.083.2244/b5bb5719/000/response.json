Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits, representing colors.\n*   The top row of the input grid appears to remain unchanged in the output grid.\n*   The bottom rows of the input grid are all 7s (orange) and also remain unchanged.\n*   Changes are happening only in the second row of the input grid.\n*   It appears we are \"shifting\" color values on row 2 of the input to generate row 2 of the output.\n*   The transformation seems to involve a complex, local modification of the second row of the input based on the first row.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
