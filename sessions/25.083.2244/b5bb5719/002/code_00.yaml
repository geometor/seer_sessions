objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable (same as input_grid)
      columns: variable (same as input_grid)
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - name: first_row
    type: 1D array
    properties:
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors), derived from input_grid[0]
      runs: list of tuples (color, length)

actions:
  - name: copy_row
    description: Copy a row from the input_grid to the output_grid.
    parameters:
      row_index: integer

  - name: transform_row_2
    description:  The transformation of the second row. Elements of the second row of output are based on runs of colors in the first row. The transformation starts with an initial value (7). Then, moving along the row, when a run of a certain length in row 1 ends, the subsequent element in row 2 is assigned to the next color of that run, and so on until all runs from the top row have been considered. When no more runs exist in the first row, and there are more elements in row 2 to transform, the last value is copied to the rest of the row.
    parameters:
        first_row: 1D array
        second_row_input: 1D array
  - name: copy_other_rows
    description: all other rows, besides row 2, are copied unchanged
    parameters: []
