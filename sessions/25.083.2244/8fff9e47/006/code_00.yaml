example1:
  input_shape: (6, 4)
  output_shape: (12, 12)
  height_ratio: 2.0
  width_ratio: 3.0
  input_colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]
  output_colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]
  transformation: |
    The input grid is divided into two sections.
    The top half of the input grid is used to create the top half of the output grid.
    The bottom half of the input grid is used to create the bottom half of the output grid.

    The top section of the output grid is formed by repeating elements in each row, and the
    number of repetitions increases. The first row is generated by taking the first row of
    the top section of the input and repeating elements.
    The pattern appears to take the top left 3x2 subgrid and expands by the width and height
    ratio and fills the top-left section of the output.

    The bottom half is similar, taking the bottom half of the input grid as a source.
    The pattern takes the bottom left subgrid of 3 x 2 and expands by the width and height
    ratio, and fills the bottom-left section of the output.

example2:
  input_shape: (4, 6)
  output_shape: (12, 12)
  height_ratio: 3.0
  width_ratio: 2.0
  input_colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9]
  output_colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9]
  transformation: |
     The input grid is divided into two sections.
     The height and width ratio are swapped compared to example 1.

     The left half of the input grid is used to create the top half of the output grid.
     The right half of the input grid is used to create the bottom half of the output grid.
     The top left 2x3 subgrid appears to be used to create the top section of the output grid by expanding
     with the width and height ratio.
     The bottom left 2x3 subgrid appears to be used to create the bottom section of the output grid by expanding
     with the width and height ratio.
