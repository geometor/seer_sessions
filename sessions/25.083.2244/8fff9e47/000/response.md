Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits, representing colors.
*   The output grids are significantly larger than the input grids, suggesting some form of expansion or replication.
*   The digits in the input grid seem to be present in the output grid, but their positions and frequencies are altered.
*   The output grids have a distinct structure: a large top-left section composed of two mirrored input grids, and a bottom-right section which seems to be some kind of inflation.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output are 2D grids.
  - observation: Output grid is larger than the input grid.
  - observation: Input grid digits appear in the output grid.
  - observation: Output grid has some sort of reflected structure.
  - property: Input grid height and width can vary.
  - property: Digits 0-9 represent different colors.
  - action: Input grid appears to get mirrored.
  - action: Input grid is somewhere expanded
  - relationship: Output grid size is related to input grid size, specifically output is double the input size.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Mirror the Input**: Create two mirrored copies of the input grid. The first, the original and, the second, a copy which is mirrored vertically.
2.  **Create Top Left Quadrant.** Stack the original on top of the mirrored copy to form the top-left quadrant.
3.  **Inflate the Input**: Take each number from the input, find its position, and generate a square with equal width and height.
4.  **Create Bottom Right Quadrant**: Place these inflated squares along the bottom right.

Essentially, the transformation involves taking the input grid, mirroring it vertically and stacking it. Mirror it horizontally to create the top right. Then it involves creating a larger grid by taking each number from the input grid, inflating it into an equal height and width square and placing each square along the bottom and right, starting the next square where the previous one ended.
