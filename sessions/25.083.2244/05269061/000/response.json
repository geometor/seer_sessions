            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to understand the transformation rule:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid of the same dimensions. The input grids seem to have a \"seed\" pattern of non-zero values, often in the top-left corner, which then expands or replicates to fill the entire output grid. The zeros in the input grid seem to act as placeholders, being replaced by the repeating pattern. There's a strong sense of symmetry and repetition in the output grids. The core pattern, derived from the input, is maintained and propagated.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This sequence forms the repeating unit.\n2. **Expand Horizontally:**  Repeat the core pattern horizontally across each row of the output grid. If the pattern is shorter than the row length, continue repeating it until the row is filled.\n3. **Expand Vertically:** Repeat the pattern established in each row vertically down the columns. If the pattern height is less than grid, then continue repeating rows until grid is filled. In essence, the entire input pattern, including original zeros, is replicated.\n4.  **Replace Zeros:** The zeros of the original input, are replaced by elements of repeating sequence.\n\nIn Summary: The transformation takes a seed sequence of non-zero numbers from the input grid and replicates it both horizontally and vertically to fill the entire output grid, replacing the initial zeros in the process. The replication maintains the order and arrangement of the seed sequence.\n"
