objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same in input and output
      - cells: contain single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
      - pattern: a core sequence of non-zero numbers in the input, often starting from the top-left.
    actions:
      - expansion:  The core pattern replicates to fill the entire output grid.
      - replacement: Zero values in the input are replaced by elements of the repeating pattern.

relationships:
  - input_grid: Contains the seed pattern.
  - output_grid:  A fully expanded version of the seed pattern, maintaining symmetry and repetition.
  - pattern_elements: Non-zero numbers in the input grid form the repeating sequence.
