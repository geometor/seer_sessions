Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program was based on a simple observation: yellow pixels stay, and azure pixels move. The results show this is partially correct, but the movement rule for azure pixels is far more complex than initially thought. The current logic fails to correctly handle various configurations of azure pixels, particularly regarding their connectivity and position relative to the edges of the grid. We need a more sophisticated understanding of when azure pixels should be grouped, their connection, and the direction and magnitude of their move. The errors across the three examples confirm this. The strategy will be to carefully examine the input/output pairs, focusing on the *differences* and the precise arrangements of azure (8) pixels.

**Metrics and Observations (per example):**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on what went wrong and the specific arrangement of azure pixels.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** Azure pixels are in various arrangements: isolated, connected horizontally, and connected vertically. Yellow pixels form a separate shape.
*   **Expected Output:** Isolated azure pixels seem to be duplicated on their line. Connected azure pixels (horizontally) are extended to the right edge.
*   **Actual Output:** fails to reproduce this pattern. Isolated are moved to left.
*   **Discrepancy:** The program doesn't handle the duplication or the extension to edge based on connectivity.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** Similar to example 1, but with a different arrangement of isolated and connected azure pixels.
*   **Expected Output:** Similar principles as in example 1, but adapted to the different layout. Isolated azure pixels are duplicated to the left, one connected group is extended to the left.
*   **Actual Output:** moved to the extreme left or mirrored, not matching the expected transformation.
*   **Discrepancy:** Reinforces the issue with connected vs. isolated pixel movement and indicates dependency with initial position (left or right).

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** More variations in azure pixel configurations.
*   **Expected Output:** Connected pixels move to left.
*   **Actual Output:** moves isolated and connected pixel in the same way
*   **Discrepancy:** Confirms dependency on connectivity.

**YAML Fact Extraction:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: yellow_pixels
    color: 4
    behavior: stationary
    description: "Yellow pixels remain in their original positions."

  - object: azure_pixels
    color: 8
    behavior: dynamic
    rules:
      - condition: "isolated"
        action: "duplicated within its row. If starts at column 0, adds a copy to its right. If there is an azure pixel to its right (but not adjacent), two pixels are placed to the left."
      - condition: "horizontally_connected"
        action: "expands to the nearest edge of the grid, keeping relative position (left,right)"
    description: "Azure pixels move based on their connectivity and initial location."

  - grid:
    property: fixed_size
    description: "The grid dimensions remain constant between input and output."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve Yellow:** All yellow (4) pixels in the input grid remain in the exact same positions in the output grid.

2.  **Assess Azure Connectivity:** For each azure (8) pixel in the input grid:
    *   Determine if it is "isolated" or "horizontally connected." An isolated azure pixel has no immediate horizontal neighbors (left or right) of the same color. A horizontally connected azure pixel has at least one horizontal neighbor of the same color.

3.  **Move Azure Pixels:**
    *   **Isolated Azure Pixels:**
        * If in the first column(0), duplicate it to it's right.
        * If it has an azure pixel in it's row, but not connected, add two copies of it on the left.
    *   **Horizontally Connected Azure Pixels:** Expand the connected group of azure pixels to the nearest border, preserving their relative positions(left or right).

4. **Grid Dimensions:** The overall dimensions (width and height) of the grid do not change during the transformation.
