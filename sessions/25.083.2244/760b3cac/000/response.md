Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids have the same dimensions (6x9 in the examples). The grids contain single-digit integers (0, 4, and 8), representing different colors.  The primary colors involved seem to be azure (8) and yellow (4), with white (0) as the background. The core operation appears to be some form of selective modification or movement of the azure (8) pixels, while the yellow (4) pixels remain unchanged. The change of azure positions seems to depend on its initial position.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 6x9
      elements: [0, 4, 8]  # Values representing colors
    role: input

  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 6x9
      elements: [0, 4, 8]
    role: output

  - type: pixel_group
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      shape: variable #can be a single pixel or line of pixels
    role: moving_object

  - type: pixel_group
    properties:
      color: yellow (4)
      shape: variable
    role: static_object

actions:
  - name: move_azure
    agent: pixel_group (azure)
    parameters:
      direction: conditional # Depends on initial arrangement
      distance: conditional

relationships:
  - subject: azure pixels
    relation: change position
    object: output grid
  - subject: yellow pixels
    relation: remain stationary
    object: output grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8) and yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Static Yellow:** The yellow (4) pixels maintain their exact positions in the output grid. Copy them directly.
3.  **Conditional Azure Movement:** The core logic affects azure pixels, we can split azure pixels in 2 categories, isolated and connected. An isolated azure pixel has less than 2 adjacent azure pixels.
4.  **Transformation Rule:** For isolated azure (8) pixels check if is possible put it at left, otherwise put it at right. The connected azure pixels is mirrored vertically.
