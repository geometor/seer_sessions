objects:
  - color: yellow
    behavior: static  # Yellow pixels do not change position.
    properties:
      value: 4

  - color: azure
    behavior: dynamic  # Azure pixels change position based on rules.
    properties:
      value: 8
      connectivity:
        - isolated  # Not adjacent to any other azure pixel.
        - horizontal # Adjacent to another azure pixel in the same row.
    actions:
      - shift_left: |
          If an isolated azure pixel is not in the first column, it is moved to the first column of its row.
          If other isolated azure pixels exist in the row, they are duplicated at the right of first azure position
      - duplicate_right:  |
          If an isolated azure pixel IS in the first column, another is added in the next position.
      - expand_connected: |
          Horizontally connected azure pixels are expanded.
          If the connection goes from one extreme, keep expanding until all connected pixels are in the limit
          If not, expand at the beginning of the array
