The transformation rule is as follows:

1. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
2. Check if the current pixel is yellow (4).
3. If a yellow(4) pixel is:
   -  at an even column and even row, change to magenta (6)
   -  at an even column and odd row, change to magenta (6) only if the column index is NOT a multiple of 4.
4. Keep any pixel that is not yellow as its original value.
5. The output grid retains the same dimensions (rows and columns) as the input grid.
