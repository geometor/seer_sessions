"""
1.  **Iterate:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Yellow Pixels:** If a pixel is yellow (color value 4), determine if it should be transformed based on its row and column index.
3.  **Conditional Transformation (Row-Specific Rules):**
    *   **Row 0:** If the yellow pixel's column index is a multiple of 6 (0, 6, 12, etc.), change it to magenta (6).
    *   **Row 1:** If the yellow pixel's column index is a multiple of 3 (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. ), change it to magenta.
    *   **Row 2:** If the yellow pixel's column index is 3 or 9, change it to magenta (6).
    *   **Repeating Pattern**: These row specific rules then repeat for subsequent rows. Row 3 follows rules of Row 0. Row 4 follows rules of Row 1. Row 5 follows rules of Row 2.
4.  **Preserve Other Colors:** If a pixel is not yellow, its color remains unchanged.
5.  **Output:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, with pixel colors determined by the above rules.
