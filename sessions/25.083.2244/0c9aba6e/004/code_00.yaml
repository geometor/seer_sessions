observations:
  - task: "Identify and transform 'L' shapes"
  - objects:
      - name: "L shape"
        properties:
          - color: magenta (6)
          - shape: "Three connected pixels forming a right angle (L)"
          - size: 3 pixels
      - name: "separator line"
        properties:
          - color: orange (7)
          - shape: "Horizontal line across the entire width"
      - name: "transformed L shape"
        properties:
          - color: azure (8)
          - shape: "Matches the original L shape"
  - actions:
      - name: "Find separator"
        description: "Locate the horizontal line of orange pixels."
      - name: "Identify L shapes"
        description: "Find all L-shaped groups of magenta pixels below the separator line."
      - name: "Transform L shapes"
        description: "Change the color of the identified L shapes to azure, keeping the same output"
  - context:
      - "The transformation only applies to the part of the grid *below* the separator line."
      - "If no separator line exists, no transformation is performed."
      - "Output should reflect a copy of the bottom half of the input with replacement, not a new grid"
