Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** Both examples show a 5x5 grid with a distinct pattern. The outer border is a single color, and the interior is filled with another color, forming a smaller square within the larger one.
*   **Output:** The output grids are significantly larger (10x10) and more complex. They appear to be a patterned combination of the original input grid and some newly introduced elements. The most noticeable new element is a cross shape of the color '2' in the first example, and of color '8' in the second, along with the other colors from the original input grids.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: 5x5
      border_color: [2 in example 1, 9 in example 2]
      inner_color: [3 in example 1, 8 in example 2]
      center_color: [5 in example 1, 2 in example 2]

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: 10x10
      pattern: "complex, repeating"
      colors: "includes input colors and new color (2 in the second plane)"

actions:
  - type: expand
    description: "Input grid is expanded in size."

  - type: replicate_and_add_plane
    description: The input colors are used and another plane is generated.

relationships:
  - input_to_output: "Input grid is transformed into a larger, patterned output grid."
  - colors: "Some colors from input persist in output; a new cross shaped object is formed."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of size 10x10.

2.  **Input Replication:** create a 5 x 2 block, the first column being the original input and the second one being filled by value 2 in example 1 and 9 in example 2.

3.  **Cross Creation:** Create another block of 5 x 2 where the first column is filled by the color corresponding to the center color in the input.

4. **Block combination**: combine the two previous blocks.

5.  **Output Construction:** fill the rest of the cells to get a 10 x 10 grid.
