            "text": "Okay, here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the errors in the generated code.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code was based on a limited understanding of the transformation, focusing primarily on the first training example. The results from testing on both examples reveal significant discrepancies. The code fails to correctly reproduce the output grids, missing key elements of the transformation logic. The primary issue seems to be an incorrect reconstruction of the output grid, with many misplaced or missing pixels, especially in the added columns and rows. The strategy should be to:\n\n1.  **Re-examine the transformation:** Carefully analyze the input-output pairs of both examples to identify the *complete* set of rules governing the transformation.\n2.  **Identify Misconceptions:** Pinpoint the specific assumptions in the current code that are incorrect. For example, the assumption about hardcoded values for plane2 (5 in example 1 and 2 in example 2) and how the planes were constructed and used to construct the output grid.\n3.  **Refine the Algorithm:** Rewrite the natural language program to reflect a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the transformation.\n4.  **Revise the code**: Update the function by focusing first on identifying the correct \"building blocks\" (planes) and then construct the correct sequence of operations on those planes.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n\nLet's use code execution to verify some basic assumptions and gather more information. I want to check a basic assumption of what values are in the plane.\n\n"
