Okay, let's analyze the provided information and devise a strategy to improve the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example and correctly identified the border, inner, and center colors. The strategy of constructing "planes" (sub-grids) and arranging them is a reasonable approach. However, the code fails to accurately reproduce the bottom half of the output grid in both examples. The "Pixels Off," "Color Palette Correct," and "Color Count Correct" metrics all indicate significant discrepancies, particularly in the bottom half. The core issue is the incorrect reconstruction logic for rows 5-9 of the output grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze both examples, focusing on the relationship between the input and output grids, especially how the bottom half of the output is derived.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for consistent patterns in how colors and shapes from the input grid are replicated or transformed in the output grid. Pay very close attention to the arrangement of the center, border and inner colors.
3. **Refine Bottom-Half Logic**: The primary focus will be modifying the code that constructs `output_grid[5:10, :]` to accurately reflect the observed pattern. The logic for the top half is correct.
4. **Verify and Validate:** Use the provided results to continuously check assumptions and adjust logic accordingly. It's useful to see the partially correct construction of the top half.

**Gather Metrics:**

Let's use the `get_colors` function to ensure color identification is correct for both examples.


``` python
import numpy as np

def get_colors(input_grid):
    border_color = input_grid[0, 0]
    center_color = input_grid[2, 2]
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(5):
            if input_grid[i,j] != border_color and input_grid[i, j] != center_color:
                inner_color = input_grid[i,j]
                return border_color, inner_color, center_color
    return border_color, None, center_color

# Example 1 Input
input_grid1 = np.array([
    [2, 3, 3, 3, 2],
    [3, 3, 5, 3, 3],
    [3, 5, 5, 5, 3],
    [3, 3, 5, 3, 3],
    [2, 3, 3, 3, 2]
])

# Example 2 Input
input_grid2 = np.array([
    [9, 8, 8, 8, 9],
    [8, 8, 2, 8, 8],
    [8, 2, 2, 2, 8],
    [8, 8, 2, 8, 8],
    [9, 8, 8, 8, 9]
])

border_color1, inner_color1, center_color1 = get_colors(input_grid1)
border_color2, inner_color2, center_color2 = get_colors(input_grid2)

print(f"Example 1: Border={border_color1}, Inner={inner_color1}, Center={center_color1}")
print(f"Example 2: Border={border_color2}, Inner={inner_color2}, Center={center_color2}")


```
```
Example 1: Border=2, Inner=3, Center=5
Example 2: Border=9, Inner=8, Center=2

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colors:** Determine the border color (top-left pixel), inner color (any pixel different from border and center), and center color (pixel at the center of the input grid).
2.  **Construct Top Half:**
    *   Create four planes: `plane1` (original input grid), `plane2` (5x1 border color), `plane3` (5x1 inner color), and `plane4` (5x1 center color).
    *   Place `plane1` in the top-left corner of the output grid (0:5, 0:5).
    *   Place `plane2` to the immediate right of `plane1` (0:5, 5:6) and three columns to its right [0:5, 8:9].
    *  Place `plane4` to the immediate right of first `plane2` [0:5, 6:7] and to the immediate right of the second `plane2` [0:5, 9:10].
    *   Place `plane3` between the two `plane2` and `plane4` placements [0:5, 7:8].
3.  **Construct Bottom Half:** The bottom half (rows 5-9) of the 10x10 output grid follows a specific pattern based on the three identified colors (border, inner, center):
    * Create a repeating sequence based on example 1: 2, 5, 3, 2, 5 and example 2: 9, 2, 8, 9, 2. The first value of the repeating sequence corresponds to the border color, the second one to the center color, and the third to the inner color.
    * Create a horizontal mirrored pattern based on this sequence starting at position [5,0] down to [9,0] , up to [9,4].
    * Starting from [5,5] to [8,5] the inner color is replicated. The inner color is also placed at positions [7,6] and [8,6], and [8,7].
    * Starting at [9,5] the sequence is changed to: center, border, border, border, center.
