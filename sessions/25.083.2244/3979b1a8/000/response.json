The outer border is a single color, and the interior is filled with another color, forming a smaller square within the larger one.\n*   **Output:** The output grids are significantly larger (10x10) and more complex. They appear to be a patterned combination of the original input grid and some newly introduced elements. The most noticeable new element is a cross shape of the color '2' in the first example, and of color '8' in the second, along with the other colors from the original input grids.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
