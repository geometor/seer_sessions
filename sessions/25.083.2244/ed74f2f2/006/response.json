            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe current implementation uses a lookup table (`lookup`) within the `get_output_column` function. This approach is rigid and relies on having seen the exact 3x3 subgrid pattern before. It performs well on examples 2 and 6, where the lookup table had an exact match. It got part of the output correct for the other examples because the central section of the input grid was 5, and the lookup did contain one or more correct output columns for the example 3x3 subgrids.\n\nHowever it failed for example 1, 3, 4 and 5 because the outputs in the lookup table don't correspond to the correct output. My strategy is:\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully review all training examples to identify a more general rule that doesn't depend solely on exact 3x3 subgrid matches.  The current lookup table approach is too brittle.  We need a rule based on properties of the subgrids, not the entire subgrid itself.\n2.  **Focus on Subgrid Properties:** Instead of memorizing entire subgrids, look for properties *within* each subgrid that determine the output column. These properties could include:\n    *   The presence/absence of specific colors.\n    *   The *count* of specific colors.\n    *   The *positions* of specific colors (top row, middle row, bottom row, etc.).\n    *   Relationships *between* colors within a subgrid.\n3.  **Hypothesis Generation and Testing:** Formulate several hypotheses about the transformation rule.  Use Python code to extract the necessary subgrid properties and test these hypotheses against the examples.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Start with the simplest possible rules and gradually increase complexity as needed to match the examples. The best approach is to get something working for ALL examples then improve that, rather than something that works perfectly for some, and not at all for others.\n5. **Update Natural Language Program, Code, and Facts**: As the testing refines the natural language program, I'll document it accurately, as well as any discovered facts.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis**\n\nI'll start by manually inspecting the examples to come up with a better rule.\n\n"
