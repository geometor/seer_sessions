1.  **Input:** A 2D grid (`InputGrid`) of color values.

2.  **Central Rows:** Consider only the central three rows of the `InputGrid`.

3.  **Subgrid Extraction:** Divide these central rows into three 3x3 subgrids, moving from left to right.

4.  **Subgrid Analysis:** For each 3x3 `Subgrid`:
    *   Count the occurrences of color 5 (gray).
    *   If the count of gray is 0, the output column is all 0s.
    *   If the count of gray is 1, the output column is [0, 2, 0].
    *   If the count of gray is 2, the output column is [2, 0, 0].
    *   If the count of gray is 3, the output column is [2, 2, 2].
    *   If the count of gray is 4, and the center pixel is not gray, the output column is [0, 2, 2].
    *    If the count of gray is 4, and the center is gray:
            If the top center pixel is gray, and the bottom center is not, the output column is [2,2,0].
            If the bottom center is gray and the top center is not, the output column is [0,2,2].
    *   If the count of gray is 5:
            If the top left, top center, bottom center and bottom right are gray - output column is [1,1,0]
            If the top left, center, bottom left, and bottom right are grey: [1, 1, 1]
            If top center, center, bottom center are grey, [3,3,0].
            If top center, center, bottom left are grey, [2,0,0].
            If top right, center, and bottom left are grey, [0, 1, 0]

    *   If the count of gray is 6, the output is all 0.
    *   If the count of gray is 7, the output is all 0.
    *    If the count of gray is 8, [1,0,1].
    *    If the count of gray is 9, [1,1,1]

5.  **Output Construction:** Create a 3x3 `OutputGrid`.
    *   The first column of `OutputGrid` is determined by the first (leftmost) `Subgrid`.
    *   The second column of `OutputGrid` is determined by the second (middle) `Subgrid`.
    *   The third column of `OutputGrid` is determined by the third (rightmost) `Subgrid`.

6.  **Output:** Return the 3x3 `OutputGrid`.
