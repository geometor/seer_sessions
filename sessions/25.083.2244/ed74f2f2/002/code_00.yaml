facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - rows: integer, between 1 and 30
      - columns: integer, between 1 and 30
      - cells: integer values representing colors (0-9)

  - object: subgrid
    description: 3x3 section of the input grid
    properties:
      - location:  left, center, or right (corresponding to columns 0, 1, 2 of output)
      - gray_count: Number of gray pixels (value 5) within the subgrid

  - action: transform
    description: Creates a 3x3 output grid based on gray pixel counts in input subgrids.
    rules:
      - rule_1: |
        If subgrid is in the left section (section 0), a row in the output at that location is assigned based on the gray_count:
          2 gray pixels give the values [0,2,0].
          3 gray pixels give the values [x,x,x] - not clear.
          4 gray pixels give a value based on the row, [1,1,1], [3,3,3], [1,0,1], or [2,0,0]
      - rule_2: |
         If the subgrid is in the center location (section 1), then a row is assigned based on gray_count:
          2 gray pixels give the value [2,2,2]
          3 gray pixels give the value [0,1,0] or [0,2,0]
          4 gray pixels give [0,1,1] or [2,0,0].
      - rule_3:  |
          If subgrid is in the right section (section 2), a row in the output at that location is assigned based on the gray_count:
          2 gray pixels give the value [0,2,0].
          3 gray pixels give the values [3,3,0].
          4 gray pixels give the value [1,1,0], [1,1,1], or [0,2,0]
