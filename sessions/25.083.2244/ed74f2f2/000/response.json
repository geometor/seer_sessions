            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input Grids:** The input grids are consistently 9x5 (width x height) and predominantly contain the value '0' (white), with patterns formed by '5' (gray). The gray pixels appear to be the active elements, while the white pixels act as background.\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are consistently 3x3. The values in output grids are mostly in the range 0-3, with a few exceptional occurrences of `1`s in train_1 and train_3.\n*   **Spatial Relationship:** The output grid seems to represent a condensed or abstracted version of the input grid. There's no simple 1:1 mapping of input cells to output cells. It is likely related to the gray area in the input.\n*    **Object Recognition:** The gray ('5') pixels in the input form distinct shapes or clusters. These shapes are not simple geometric primitives (like squares or lines) but vary in configuration.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Focus on the central 3 rows.\n\n2.  **Divide into 3x3 Sections:** Conceptually divide the central area of the input grid (rows 2-4, columns 2-10) into three 3x3 blocks.\n\n3.  **Count Foreground Pixels and Assign Output:** Within each of these 3x3 sections, count the occurrences of the foreground color (gray, '5').\n\n    *   If an input 3x3 block on the *left* of the overall grid pattern contains exactly one gray pixel, the corresponding output pixel in the output 3x3 representation is `1`.\n    *   If an input 3x3 block on the *left* of the overall grid pattern contains exactly three gray pixels, the corresponding output pixel in the output 3x3 representation is `3`.\n    *    If an input 3x3 section in the *center* of the overall grid pattern contains two gray pixels, the output pixel is `2`.\n\n4. **Fill the Output Grid**: Create the output, any region not matching the above is zero.\n\nIn Summary, the number of grey pixels in the three inner rows and their location within a conceptually divided 3x3 area seems to determine the output grid, where we count '5' pixels in each 3x3 block of the input and set an output value based on the rules above, for each of the blocks in order.\n"
