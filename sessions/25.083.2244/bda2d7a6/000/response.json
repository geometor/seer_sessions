            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output pairs and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program description:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Objects:** The core objects are rectangular grids of pixels. Each pixel has a single color value (0-9). Within each grid, there appear to be larger rectangular regions of uniform color, forming a kind of \"border\" and an \"inner rectangle.\" The border is always one pixel thick.\n*   **Transformations:** It appears the transformation inverts the roles of the border and the inner rectangle. The color of the border in the input becomes the color of the inner rectangle in the output, and the *innermost* color of the input's inner rectangle becomes the color of the output's border.\n* **Relationship:** The key relationship seems to be the spatial containment of the inner rectangle within the border. The colors \"swap\" roles based on the position.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
