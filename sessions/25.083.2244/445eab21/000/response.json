The background is consistently black (0).  The object of interest appears to be defined by the largest connected component (contiguous block) of a single, non-zero color in the top half of the input grid.  The output is always a 2x2 grid of the identified object's color. The bottom half of the input grid contains a different, potentially distracting object, which is ignored.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
