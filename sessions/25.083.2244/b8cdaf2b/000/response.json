Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to focus on modifying a specific object in the input grid, specifically the object defined by contiguous pixels of the largest-valued color, and copying its border one row/column up, mirroring the pixels on the border. The copied pixels take the colors of the border pixels. Other parts of the grid seem to stay the same. The examples seem to use different colors to represent the border.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
