facts:
  - object1:
      description: The lowest row of the input grid containing non-zero values.
      properties:
        colors: A set of the distinct colors present in object1.
        coordinates: The row and column indices of each pixel in object1.
  - object2:
      description: Pixels above object 1, that do not share any colors with object 1
      properties:
        colors: A set of the distinct colors present in object2.
        coordinates: The row and column indices of each pixel in object2.
        connected_to_object1: True if any pixel in object2 is directly above a pixel in object1.
  - transformation:
      description: Copy a pattern of colors from object1 to object2.
      rules:
        - If a pixel in object2 is directly above a pixel in object1, and are the same colors, then change the Object 2 pixel to the object 1 color
        - The color of object 1 on the edges is propagated up into the object 2 connected color
        - Any section of object 2 connected above and between the two object 1 edge colors, is filled in with alternating colors from object 1.
