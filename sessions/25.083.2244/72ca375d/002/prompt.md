"""
1. Identify Shapes: Scan the input grid and identify all distinct rectangular regions of non-zero pixels. Each region is considered a separate "shape," characterized by its color, position, width, and height.
2. Select Shape: Choose *one* of the identified shapes based on a specific criteria.
    - Example 1 selects the yellow (4) object
    - Example 2 selects the magenta (6) object
    - Example 3 selects the gray (5) object
3. Extract Shape: Create a new, smaller grid. Copy the selected shape from the input grid onto this new grid.
4. Remove Zeros: Remove rows and columns of 0's from the output grid.
