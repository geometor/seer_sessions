The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid.
The transformation appears to be a reversal of the order of cells, and some shifting.
1.  Reverse and Shift: Create the output grid by putting input cells in reverse order, bottom right cell be the same as input grid's upper left cell.
2.  Shift each row to the right until non-white (0) cells are right aligned

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of reversing and right-shifting non-zero elements was partially successful. Example 1 worked perfectly, but Examples 2 and 3 failed. The primary issue seems to be with how the reversal and shifting are implemented. It appears the `np.flip` function flips the entire array, which is not always the intended outcome. It doesn't accurately model the expected shift. A row-by-row shift to the right is indeed needed, but the global flip isn't always correct. We may want to consider maintaining the original shapes.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Examples in Detail:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example to pinpoint the exact discrepancies. I will create a tool to identify the row and columns differences in the arrays.
2.  **Refine the Reversal/Shift Logic:** Instead of a global flip, consider reversing the order of elements *within* each row, followed by the right-shift.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to accurately reflect the refined logic, ensuring it covers all observed cases.

**Gather Metrics and Analyze Examples:**

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task: reverse_and_shift_rows
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: variable rows and columns

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: same as input_grid

actions:
  - name: reverse_within_row
    description: Reverse the order of elements within each row, considering only non-zero elements.
    input: row (1D array)
    output: reversed_row (1D array)

  - name: shift_right
    description: Shift non-zero elements to the rightmost positions within each row.
    input: row (1D array)
    output: shifted_row (1D array)

  - name: combine
    description: create the output by shifting then reversing elements within each row
    input: input grid
    output: output grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros (white).
2.  **Row-wise Processing:** For each row in the input grid:
    a. **Identify Non-Zero Elements**: Extract the non-zero elements, preserving their original order.
    b. **Reverse Sub-row**: Reverse only the order of the non-zero elements extracted from the current row.
    c. **Right-Shift:** Create a new row for the output grid. Place the reversed non-zero elements to the rightmost positions of this new row. Fill the remaining positions (if any) with zeros.
    d. **Assign:** Copy this newly constructed row to the corresponding row in the output grid.
3. **Output:** The `output_grid` now contains the transformed data. Return this grid.

Essentially, the transformation reverses *only the non-zero elements* of each row and then right-aligns them. The previous implementation incorrectly flipped the entire array. The core concept is right, but the execution was flawed.
