Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both rectangular grids of varying dimensions.
*   **Colors:** Each cell in the grid contains a single digit (0-9), representing a color.
*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects. However, in these examples, single pixels of different colors also seem to act as independent objects.
*    **Spatial Arrangement**: in some cases the input grid pixels appear in reverse order in the output grid
*   **Mirroring**: The output is the reverse of the input, and can be generated by rotating the input 180 degrees and shifting.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_description: |
  The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid.
  The transformation appears to be a rotation, and some shifting.

objects:
  - name: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
    possible_actions:
      - move: Change position within the grid.

transformation_properties:
  - type: reverse order (rotate 180)
  - type: shift

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Reverse and Shift**. Create the output grid by putting input cells in reverse order. So that, in the output grid, the bottom right cell will be the same as the input grid's upper left cell.
2. Shift each row to the right until the cell colors other than white (0) are right aligned
