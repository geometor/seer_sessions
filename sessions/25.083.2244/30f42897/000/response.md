Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the underlying transformation logic. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Objects:** The primary objects are rectangular grids (2D arrays) filled with single-digit integers (0-9), each representing a color. Within the grids, we can identify contiguous blocks of the same color as distinct objects.
*   **Relationships:** The spatial relationships between pixels (adjacency, position) are crucial. We observe changes in these relationships between the input and output grids. The examples demonstrate a mirrored, diagonal symettry.
*   **Transformations:** The transformation involves a patterned modification of the input grid to produce the output grid. Certain pixels change their color values based on their position and potentially the values of neighboring pixels. It seems the program will try to "mirror" some sections of image.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - observation: mirroring_changes
    description: Pixel values are mirrored to other locations within the grids.
  - observation: diagonal_influence
    description: There may be mirroring based on a diagonal line that runs from top left to bottom right.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:**
    Treat the entire input grid as the main object.

2.  **Diagonal Reflection.**
    The input undergoes reflection along a diagonal axis, with the choice of diagonal depending on the layout of non-8 colors in the input grid.

3.  **Determine Diagonal:**
    *   If non-8 values are present along bottom edge, mirror along a diagonal from top left.
        *   Pixels change their color to that of the pixel in the mirrored position.

    *    If non-8 values are present along the top edge and/or the right edge.
        * mirror along a diagonal from top right.
        *   Pixels change their color to that of the pixel in the mirrored position.

4.   **Construct Output:**
     The final result is the constructed grid where colors have been changed based on diagoanl reflection.
