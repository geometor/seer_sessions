            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the underlying transformation logic. Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n*   **Objects:** The primary objects are rectangular grids (2D arrays) filled with single-digit integers (0-9), each representing a color. Within the grids, we can identify contiguous blocks of the same color as distinct objects.\n*   **Relationships:** The spatial relationships between pixels (adjacency, position) are crucial. We observe changes in these relationships between the input and output grids. The examples demonstrate a mirrored, diagonal symettry.\n*   **Transformations:** The transformation involves a patterned modification of the input grid to produce the output grid. Certain pixels change their color values based on their position and potentially the values of neighboring pixels. It seems the program will try to \"mirror\" some sections of image.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
