This subgrid appears to be defined by the largest contiguous block of non-zero pixels *excluding* any black (0) pixels on the edges. The output grid's dimensions and content are determined by this specific block. There appears to be some flexibility about which subgrid to extract.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
