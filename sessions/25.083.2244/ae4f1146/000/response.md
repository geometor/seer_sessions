Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to discern the transformation logic:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grids:** Larger grids (9x9 in the examples) containing various colored pixels, predominantly black (0), azure (8), and blue (1).
*   **Output Grids:** Smaller grids (3x3) containing only azure (8) and blue (1) pixels.
*   **Spatial Relationship:** The output grid seems to represent a specific *pattern* or *motif* found within the input grid, specifically a 3x3 block.
*   **Object of Interest:** The 3 x 3 pattern of azure (8) and blue (1). The object seems to rotate within the input but maintains it's relative shape in all the examples.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [0, 1, 8]
      shape: 9x9
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [1, 8]
      shape: 3x3
  - name: target_pattern
    type: pattern
    properties:
      colors: [1,8]
      shape: 3x3
      description: "A 3x3 block of azure and blue pixels."

actions:
  - name: locate
    description: "Find the target_pattern within the input_grid."
  - name: extract
    description: "Extract the 3x3 target_pattern from input_grid to create the output_grid."

relationships:
  - description: "The output_grid is a sub-grid of the input_grid, representing a specific pattern (target_pattern)."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate:** Scan the input grid to identify a 3x3 sub-grid (the *target pattern*) that consists only of azure (8) and blue (1) pixels. There will be only *one* instance.
2.  **Extract:** Once the 3x3 pattern is located, extract it precisely, cell by cell.
3. **Form Output** Use the extracted 3x3 area makes up the output grid.

In simple terms, find the unique 3x3 block of only azure and blue in the large grid, and that block *is* the output.
