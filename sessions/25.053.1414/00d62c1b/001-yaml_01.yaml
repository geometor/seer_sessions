facts:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
    properties:
      - dimensions: height and width are equal, and constant across input/output.
      - values: integers in the range 0-9.
  - type: object
    description: contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: integer value representing the color.
      - location: row and column indices in the grid.
  - type: transformation
    description: modification of the grid based on specific rules.
    actions:
      - identify: find all pixels with the value '3'.
      - modify: change the color of pixels that are direct horizontal or vertical neighbors (not diagonal) to '3', by updating the to value '4'.
      - preserve: keeps the original pixels that were '3' as '3'.
    constraints:
      - spatial: only directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) pixels are affected, not diagonals.
