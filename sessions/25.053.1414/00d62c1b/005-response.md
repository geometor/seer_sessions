Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program and supporting information.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a simple premise: change the color of non-green pixels adjacent to green pixels to yellow. However, the test results across multiple examples reveal a critical flaw: the "chain reaction" effect.  The code modifies pixels to yellow, and *then* those newly-yellow pixels also trigger changes in *their* neighbors. This cascading effect leads to an over-application of the yellow color, significantly deviating from the expected outputs.

The core strategy to fix this is to prevent the "chain reaction". We need to ensure that only the *original* input grid is used to determine which pixels should change. We can implement this using different approaches such as creating a copy, using an auxiliary data structure like a set to store the coordinates to turn yellow, or creating a set of coordinates of added yellows in each iteration of the green pixels.

**Metrics and Observations (per example)**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including specific observations and metrics gathered using my prior knowledge and analysis of the images provided:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Observation:** The transformed output has extra yellow pixels. The yellow spreads outwards from the green, two cells horizontally and vertically, rather than just one.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   `pixels_off`: 10
        *   size/color palette are correct.
        * counts of the number of pixels per color are incorrect.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Observation:** Similar to Example 1, the yellow color propagates excessively.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   `pixels_off`: 25
        * size/color palette are correct.
        * counts of the number of pixels per color are incorrect.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Observation:**  Yellow extends beyond the immediate neighbors of the green pixels.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   `pixels_off`: 29
        * size/color palette are correct.
        * counts of the number of pixels per color are incorrect.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   **Observation:**  Excessive yellow propagation, especially noticeable around clusters of green pixels.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   `pixels_off`: 34
        * size/color palette are correct.
        * counts of the number of pixels per color are incorrect.

*   **Example 5:**
    *   **Observation:** This largest example demonstrates the flaw most dramatically.  Large areas are incorrectly turned yellow.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   `pixels_off`: 101
        * size/color palette are correct.
        * counts of the number of pixels per color are incorrect.

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
observations:
  - task_id: '004'
  - object_types:
    - pixel:
        properties:
          color: [0, 3, 4] # white, green, yellow
          position: [row, col]
        actions:
          change_color:
            condition: "adjacent to green pixel in the original input grid"
            from: "[any color other than green]"
            to: "yellow"
  - transformation_rules:
      - "Iterate through each pixel of the input grid."
      - "Identify green pixels (color value 3)."
      - "For each green pixel, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right)."
      - "If a neighbor's original color is not green, change it to yellow (color value 4) in the output grid"
      - "Green pixels retain original value."
      - "Pixels not adjacent to a green pixel in original grid are unchanged"

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Copy Input:** Create a copy of the input grid. This copy will serve as the reference for the original state.
2.  **Find Green Pixels:** In the *original* grid (the copy), locate all pixels with a color value of '3' (green).
3.  **Iterate:** For *each* green pixel found in the original grid:
    *   **Check Neighbors:** Examine its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right - not diagonal) *in the original grid*.
    *   **Conditional Change:** For *each* neighboring pixel in the original input grid:
        *   If the neighboring pixel's color *in the original grid* is *not* '3' (green), change the corresponding pixel's color in the *output* grid to '4' (yellow).
4.  **Preserve Greens:** The green pixels that initiated the checks should remain green in the output grid.
5.  **Output:** The final output is the modified grid, where only non-green pixels directly adjacent to green pixels in the *original* input grid have been changed to yellow. All other pixels should retain their original colors from the input.
