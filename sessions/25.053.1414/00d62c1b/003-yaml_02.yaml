summary: |
    The task involves changing the color of pixels adjacent to green pixels.
    Only pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, right, not diagonal) to
    green pixels should be changed.  The change is to yellow, and
    only if the adjacent pixel *wasn't* green originally. Green pixels remain unchanged.
