            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of expanding a shape defined by green (3) pixels and changing adjacent non-green pixels to yellow (4). However, the results clearly show a major flaw: the expansion isn't limited to the \"inside\" of the shape, and it incorrectly fills the entire grid with yellow (4) except for the initial green pixels. The code is adding *all* neighbors to the shape, instead of only adding inside neighbors.\n\nThe core issue is that the code doesn't correctly distinguish between \"inside\" and \"outside\" pixels relative to the initial green shape. The `while` loop continues adding neighbors indiscriminately, leading to the whole grid filled. We need to refine how the code handles expansion so it expands the initial green area one layer at a time to only include empty areas surrounded by the initial shape, filling those inside areas with yellow.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\nHere's a breakdown of the metrics for each example (summarized from provided results):\n\n| Example | Match | Pixels Off | Size Correct | Palette Correct | Pixel Counts Correct | Notes                                                                                 |\n|---------|-------|------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1       | False | 28         | True         | True            | False                | Fills entire grid except for initial green.                                         |\n| 2       | False | 84         | True         | True            | False                | Same as above. More complex green shape, more errors.                               |\n| 3       | False | 69         | True         | True            | False                | Same as above.                                                                        |\n| 4       | False | 65         | True         | True            | False                | Same as above.                                                                        |\n| 5       | False | 302        | True         | True            | False                | Same as above, large input, many errors.                                               |\n\nThe consistent \"Pixels Off\" count, coupled with \"Size Correct\" and \"Palette Correct\" being true, confirms that the issue is specifically with *which* pixels are being colored, not with the overall dimensions or the colors used.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: 014\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    initial_shape:\n      color: green\n      pixels: [(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3)]\n    transformation:\n      action: fill_inside\n      fill_color: yellow\n      boundary_color: green\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    initial_shape:\n      color: green\n      pixels: [(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)]\n    transformation:\n      action: fill_inside\n      fill_color: yellow\n      boundary_color: green\n\n  - example_id: 3\n    initial_shape:\n      color: green\n      pixels: [(0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 6), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 7), (8, 8)]\n    transformation:\n      action: fill_inside\n      fill_color: yellow\n      boundary_color: green\n\n  - example_id: 4\n    initial_shape:\n      color: green\n      pixels: [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 7), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 8), (9, 4)]\n    transformation:\n      action: fill_inside\n      fill_color: yellow\n      boundary_color: green\n  - example_id: 5\n    initial_shape:\n      color: green\n      pixels: [(1,8),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(2,7),(2,9),(2,10),(3,8),(3,10),(4,8),(4,9),(4,10),(4,11),(4,12),(4,13),(4,14),(4,15),(5,8),(6,4),(6,8),(7,8),(8,8),(9,1),(9,8),(9,9),(9,10),(9,11),(9,12),(9,13),(9,14),(9,15),(11,8),(11,9),(11,10),(12,6),(12,7),(12,9),(12,10),(12,13),(13,7),(13,9),(13,10),(13,15),(14,7),(14,8),(14,9),(14,10),(14,12),(14,14),(14,15),(14,16),(15,10),(16,12),(16,13),(16,14)]\n    transformation:\n      action: fill_inside\n      fill_color: yellow\n      boundary_color: green\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Initial Shape:** Locate all pixels with the color green (value 3) in the input grid. These pixels define the initial shape.\n\n2.  **Identify Inside Pixels:** Define \"inside pixels\" as any non-green pixels that are completely surrounded by the initial green shape. *Completely Surrounded* means that any path from this pixel to the outside edge of the grid must cross a green pixel.\n\n3.  **Fill Inside Pixels:** Change the color of all identified \"inside pixels\" to yellow (value 4).\n\n4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid. The output grid should have the same dimensions as the input grid. Only the \"inside pixels\" should have changed from their original color to yellow. All other pixels, including the initial green shape and any pixels outside the shape, should remain their original colors.\n"
