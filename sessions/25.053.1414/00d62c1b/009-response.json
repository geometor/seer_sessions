            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial approach of identifying \"L-shapes\" of green pixels and changing the top-right pixel to yellow was partially correct in concept but flawed in its implementation. The `find_l_shape_target` function doesn't correctly identify the intended pixel, and the definition of an \"L-shape\" is too restrictive. The provided examples demonstrate a more complex pattern where multiple green pixels, often in 2x2 blocks or larger, need to be considered. We're not simply looking for isolated L-shapes, but rather identifying *multiple* potential targets within contiguous green areas based on local configurations. Also, multiple target pixels can exist within a connected object. The critical error is the L-shape function, which doesn't find the correct pixels to change, and does not identify multiple targets.\n\nThe strategy will involve:\n1.  **Improving Target Identification:** Refining the criteria for identifying which green pixel(s) should become yellow. We need to look at the 2x2 neighborhood of each green pixel.\n2.  **Multiple Targets:** Accounting for the possibility of multiple target pixels within a single green cluster and in the overall grid.\n3. **Review and Rewrite of Natural Language Program:** Describing the process in a very clear and easy to understand way.\n\n**Example Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on why the previous code failed:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code failed to identify the two \"top-right\" pixels of the two 2x2 green blocks.\n*   **Example 2:** Similar to Example 1, the \"top-right\" pixel of a 2x2 green block at `(4,6)` was not converted to yellow. It also incorrectly colored the green at `(5,3)`\n*   **Example 3:** Many target pixels were missed. The entire central area should have been converted.\n*   **Example 4:** Similar to previous cases, missed multiple targets within the green areas.\n*   **Example 5:** Demonstrated that a large number of pixels needed to be changed.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: green_cluster\n    type: contiguous_pixels\n    color: green\n    properties:\n      - shape: varies (can be 2x2, L-shaped, or larger)\n      - size: varies\n      - contains_target: boolean # Indicates if the cluster has pixel(s) to be changed\n\nactions:\n  - name: identify_target\n    input: green_cluster\n    description: Find green pixels within a cluster that meet specific criteria based on neighbor pixels.\n    criteria: |\n      A green pixel is a target if it has adjacent green neighbors\n      to the south, and west, and southwest.\n\n  - name: change_color\n    input: target_pixel\n    description: Change the color of the target pixel.\n    old_color: green\n    new_color: yellow\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Green Clusters:** Locate all contiguous blocks (clusters) of green (3) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Identify Target Pixels within Clusters:**\n    *   For each green pixel within a cluster, examine its neighbors.\n    *   If a green pixel has green neighbors directly below (south), to its left (west) and diagonal down and to its left (southwest), it is a target pixel.\n3.  **Transform Target Pixels:** Change the color of all identified target pixels from green (3) to yellow (4).\n4.  The output grid is the same size as the input grid and all non-target pixels are the same as in the input.\n\n"
