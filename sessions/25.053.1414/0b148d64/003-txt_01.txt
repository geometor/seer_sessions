*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Two main objects: one red, one becomes green.
    *   Output: The green object and some of the nearby white. The original red is removed.
    *   Result: `match: False` (Failure). The code incorrectly focused on the red object.
    *   metrics:
        ```
        pixels_off: None
        size_correct: False
        color_palette_correct: False
        correct_pixel_counts: False
        ```

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Multiple objects of various colors, including a yellow region in lower-left.
    *   Output: Cropped region with yellow and a small amount of white and black pixels.
    *   Result: `match: ERROR` (Failure). No red object exists, causing an error in the `min()` function within `crop_grid`, operating on an empty `coords` list.
    *   metrics:
        ```
        pixels_off: None
        size_correct: None
        color_palette_correct: None
        correct_pixel_counts: None
