The output grid seems to be a cropped and filtered version of the input, consisting only of the green (3) and white (0) pixels from a specific area in the lower-right portion of the input.  The red (2) areas are eliminated, effectively acting as a mask or boundary.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Note the boundary positions (top and left) of this region.\n2.  **Crop:** Define a rectangular cropping area. The top-left corner of this rectangle is the minimum x, y position of the green region, i.e., a pixel with value 3. The dimensions of the cropped region are calculated by the size of the green region itself.\n3.  **Filter:** Within the cropped region, retain only the green (3) and white (0) pixels. Remove all red (2) pixels.\n4.  **Output:** The resulting filtered and cropped region is the output.\n\nIn essence, the transformation isolates the green region, removes the red pixels, and creates a minimal bounding box surrounding all the green components.\n"
