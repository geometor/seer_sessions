Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grid appears to be composed of three primary colored regions: azure (8), white (0), and red (2). The output grid seems to be a cropped and filtered version of the input. Specifically, it appears to isolate the large red (2) region in the bottom-left of the input grid, removing a significant border of surrounding azure and white pixels, the output grid includes the lower left corner. The shape is not changed

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with values representing colors.
    properties:
      colors: [0, 2, 8]
      color_names: [white, red, azure]

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    description: A smaller 2D array of pixels.
    properties:
      colors: [0, 2]
      color_names: [white, red]

  - relationship: cropping
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    description: The output grid is a cropped version of the input grid.

  - relationship: filtering
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    description: output grid contains red shape from input grid

  - object: red_region
    type: shape
    description: large contiguous block of red pixels
    properties:
        color: 2
        location: bottom-left
        corner: lower-left

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Region:** Locate the largest contiguous region of red (2) pixels in the input grid. Note its position relative to the edges of the grid (lower-left).

2. **Crop:** Remove all rows and columns that contain only azure (8) pixels to isolate the large red area with some of the surrounding white area.

3. **Filter:**  After the cropping operation, eliminate all azure (8) pixels that remains. The output contains only red (2) and white (0) pixels.

4. **Output:** the transformed grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
