The primary colors observed are white (0), yellow (4), and blue (1). The transformation seems to involve replicating rows containing non-zero values and potentially stacking these replicated rows based on a specific pattern. The input grid contains single rows of yellow and blue, while the output consists of multiple, stacked rows of yellow and blue.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Identify rows that contain a non-zero value (in this case, rows with yellow (4) and blue (1)).\n\n2.  **Replicate Rows:** For each identified target row:\n    *   Replicate the row *n* times. *n* is determined for each input row. The yellow row appears to be replicated 4 times per stack, and the blue 4 times as well. There appear to be a total of 3 stacks for the yellow, and 2 for the blue\n\n3.  **Stack Replicated Rows:** Create \"stacks\" of the replicated rows.\n\n4. **Arrange Stacked Rows:** order the stacks according to the order they were found.\n\n5. **Assemble Output Grid:** the final output is obtained by combining the identified stacks.\n"
