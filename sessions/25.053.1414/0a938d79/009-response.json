            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a flawed understanding of the transformation rule, focusing solely on alternating patterns of 1 and 3. The test results clearly demonstrate this isn't the correct logic. The core issue is that the code doesn't correctly identify *all* non-zero values and replicate them across their respective rows. It also incorrectly handles some colors. Example 1's error demonstrates it does not replicate colors other than 1 and 3. Example 3 has additional rows that should be considered. Example 4 shows additional colors, shows alternating color rows and shows that zero rows should be maintained.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct the Core Logic:** The fundamental error is not replicating *all* non-zero colors across the row. The code needs to be revised to iterate through each cell, and if a cell has a non-zero value, it should fill the *entire rest of the row* with that same value.\n2.  **Zero Rows:** Explicitly handle rows that are all zeros. These rows should remain unchanged in the output. Previous code did not handle zero row preservation.\n3. **Eliminate Alternation**: Alternation logic is not supported.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary of observations based on all examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The original code failed to replicate colors 2 and 8, and filled zeros instead of performing any replication.\n*   **Example 2:** The code only replicated values 3, and missed replicating color 1.\n*   **Example 3:** The code failed to copy color 2, and did not copy color 3 across the rest of its row. The transformation created additional copies and extended to areas where there was all zeros.\n*   **Example 4:** The code failed to replicate colors entirely, it also copied colors to rows that contained only zeros. It also attempted an alternating pattern which is incorrect.\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      The input grids contain various colors represented by integers 0-9.\n  - observation: |\n      The output grids show a horizontal replication of non-zero colors.\n  - observation: |\n      If a row contains a non-zero value, that value is replicated across the entire row to the right.\n  - observation: |\n     Rows containing only zeros in the input remain all zeros in the output.\n  - object: rows\n    properties:\n      contains_non_zero: boolean\n    actions:\n      replicate_non_zero: |\n        If a row contains a non-zero value, replicate that value to all cells to its right within that row.\n      preserve_zeros: |\n        If a row contains only zeros, it remains unchanged in the output.\n  - object: cells\n    properties:\n        value: integer (0-9) representing color.\n        is_zero: boolean (true if value is 0, false otherwise)\n    actions:\n       replicate_value: |\n          If the cell's value isn't 0, its value overwrites all cells to its right in the row.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.\n2.  **Check** if the current row contains *any* non-zero values.\n3.  **If the row contains only zeros:** Leave the row unchanged in the output grid.\n4.  **If the row contains a non-zero value:**\n    *   Iterate through each cell in that row.\n    *   If a cell has a non-zero value, replicate that value across the *remaining* part of the row (to the right).\n\nThis revised program addresses all observed errors: it replicates *all* non-zero colors, handles zero-only rows correctly, and performs replication across the entire row, as seen in the expected outputs. The alternating color scheme has been removed.\n"
