1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0). In this case, find the red pixel (value 2) and the green pixel (value 3).
2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each identified pixel, expand its color horizontally to fill the entire row.
3.  **Vertical Repetition:** Duplicate each expanded row vertically. Alternate rows with orignal locations for red and green, so one row of red, then a row of white, the next a row of green and a row of white, etc, throughout the entire grid. If lines of different colors are on top of each other, they will overwrite each other in the order red and green pixels.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of horizontal expansion and vertical repetition was partially correct but failed to capture the core logic of alternating rows and combining information from multiple non-white pixels correctly. The code also seems to have trouble with the concept of interleaving different colors based on original position, and instead only shows one of the non-white pixel colors. The results consistently fail because the combination or mixing of multiple colored rows is not happening as described in the expected output, especially in example 1.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Correct Alternation:** The current alternation logic is flawed. It only considers a mod 2 relationship to the orignal row, but we must instead maintain the original row of each colored pixel, and copy to the other locations.
2.  **Multiple Non-White Pixels:** Handle multiple non-white pixels correctly by applying the fill, and making use of all the non-white colored pixels, as shown in example 1.
3. **Interleaving Rows:** Fill to the correct locations, by alternating pixels based on their row.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on discrepancies:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** Two non-white pixels: red (2) at (0, 5) and azure (8) at (9, 7).
    *   **Expected Output:** Alternating rows of red and azure, starting with the red pixel's row, across the whole row, and propagating down.
    *   **Actual Output:** Only red and azure colors exist. Only complete rows of these colors and not alternating positions of these colors in the expected positions.
    *   **Discrepancy:** Missed the row combining aspect and proper color and location interleaving.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** Two non-white pixels: blue (1) at (0, 5) and green (3) at (6, 8).
    *   **Expected:** Interleaved rows of blue and green pixels across the same row, then duplicated.
    *   **Actual:** The output shows mostly only lines of all green.
    *   **Discrepancy:** Incorrect color interleaving. Blue is completely absent.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:** Two non-white pixels: red (2) at (5, 0) and green (3) at (7, 8).
    *   **Expected:** Interleaved rows, where there are complete rows of red, complete rows of green, and alternating rows, which combine into all green.
    *   **Actual:** The transformed output shows only the green lines.
    *   **Discrepancy:** The output does not represent the interleaving of colors.

*    **Example 4:**
    *  **Input:**: Two non-white pixels: yellow (4) at row 7 and blue (1) at row 11.
    * **Expected**: Filled alternating lines, including the alternating lines.
    * **Actual**: The transformed output only has blue lines.
    *   **Discrepancy:** The output does not represent the interleaving of colors.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-White Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0). Note their color and original row and column.
2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each non-white pixel, create a full row of pixels with its color, starting with the original coordinates.
3.  **Vertical Interleaving:** Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input. For each row in the output, find the original rows of all non-white pixels in the input. Populate the new row by horizontally expanding the color of any matching pixels in the input. If multiple pixels can be expanded into a grid location, prioritize them in their numeric order, so lower color numbers are overwritten by higher color numbers.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
