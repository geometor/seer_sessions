observations:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: 2
          position: [0, 5]
        - color: 8
          position: [9, 7]
      output_objects:
        - description: Alternating pattern of 2 and 8 across all rows.
          details: The output rows consist of '0 0 0 0 0 2 0 8' repeated.

  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: 1
          position: [0, 5]
        - color: 3
          position: [6, 8]
      output_objects:
      - description: alternating pattern based on initial location, no propagation
        details: 'output alternates every other non-zero'

  - example_3:
      input_objects:
          - color: 2
            position: [5,0]
          - color: 3
            position: [7, 8]
      output_objects:
          - color: 2,
            rows: [5,9,13,17,21]
          - color: 3,
            rows: [7, 11, 15, 19]
      notes: |-
        Rows with leading non-zero values propagate that color.
        Additional rows added that appear to repeat existing transformed rows.

  - example_4:
    input_objects:
          - color: 4
            position: [7,0]
          - color: 1
            position: [11, 0]
    output_objects:
          - color: 4,
            rows: [7, 15, 23]
          - color: 1,
            rows: [11, 19]
    notes: |-
       Rows with leading non-zero values propagate that color.
       Additional rows are appended that repeat a previous transformed row

general:
    - All-zero rows remain unchanged.
    - pattern: The input grid is copied and modified, then the modified grid is duplicated to the final size.
    - object interaction: a single color interacts with the row
    - operation: fill row starting at the object
