facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain various colors represented by integers 0-9.
  - observation: |
      The output grids show a horizontal replication of non-zero colors.
  - observation: |
      If a row contains a non-zero value, that value is replicated across the entire row to the right.
  - observation: |
     Rows containing only zeros in the input remain all zeros in the output.
  - object: rows
    properties:
      contains_non_zero: boolean
    actions:
      replicate_non_zero: |
        If a row contains a non-zero value, replicate that value to all cells to its right within that row.
      preserve_zeros: |
        If a row contains only zeros, it remains unchanged in the output.
  - object: cells
    properties:
        value: integer (0-9) representing color.
        is_zero: boolean (true if value is 0, false otherwise)
    actions:
       replicate_value: |
          If the cell's value isn't 0, its value overwrites all cells to its right in the row.
