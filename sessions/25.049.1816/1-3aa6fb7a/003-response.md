Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in this second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3),(6,4)]
      shape: Three L-shapes
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3),(6,4)]
      shape: Three L-shapes
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
      shape: single pixels
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three "L" shaped objects of color 8 (azure) and a background of color 0 (white).

2.  **Locate Change:** Observe the differences between the input and output. The azure objects are identical. Three single blue pixels are added.

3.  **Describe the change:** Locate the corners of the azure L-shapes. Paint these corners with blue.

**Step-by-step transformation:**

1.  Find the azure (8) colored objects in the grid.
2.  Find the corners of the three L-shapes.  The coordinates are (1, 4), (2, 3), and (5,3).
3.  Paint the corner cells of the azure shapes to blue (1).
4. Keep other azure pixels.
5.  Keep other grid colors.

This natural language program describes the observed transformation, including object properties, actions, and the overall rule. The key is to identify the L-shapes, find their corners, and change only the color of those corner pixels.
