Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
      shape: Two L-shapes
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
      shape: Two L-shapes
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
      shape: single pixels
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of two "L" shaped objects of color 8 (azure) and a background of color 0 (white).

2.  **Locate Change:** Observe the differences between the input and output. The azure objects have moved. The output grid contains a single pixel.

3. **Describe the change**: Locate the corners of the azure L-shapes. Paint azure with blue.

**Step-by-step transformation:**
1. Find the azure (8) colored objects in the grid.
2. Find the corners of the two L-shapes. The coordinates are (1, 2) and (5,5).
3. Paint the corner cells of the azure shapes to blue (1).
4. Keep other azure pixels.
5. Keep other grid colors.

This natural language program describes the observed transformation concisely and completely, capturing object properties, actions, and the overall rule.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
