One is positioned at top-left corner and is formed by the cells (1, 1), (2, 1), (2,2). The other is located at the grid center-right and is formed by cells (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4).\n\n2.  **Place a Blue Pixel:** For each separated azure object, find the cell next to the object: place a single blue pixel (color 1) adjacent to each azure region.\n    - For the top-left azure object, a blue pixel is placed just on its right, in cell (1,2).\n    - For the center-right object, a blue pixel is placed just on its left, in cell (5,4).\n\n3. **No change for the rest:** Azure objects remain and the rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule is: Find all azure areas. For each distinct azure region, place a single blue pixel adjacent to it. The direction seems to be the opposite of the 'direction' of the azure object.\n"
