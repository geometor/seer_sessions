"""
1.  **Iterate through Columns:** Process the grid column by column.
2.  **Iterate through Rows (Top to Bottom):** Within each column, examine each cell from top to bottom.
3.  **Identify Yellow Pixels:** If a cell contains a yellow pixel (color 4):
    *   **Initiate Fall:** Begin a "falling" process for this yellow pixel.
    *   **Check Cell Below:** Check the cell directly below the current yellow pixel.
        *   **If White:** If the cell below is white (0), replace the white pixel with a yellow pixel (4). Move the "current yellow pixel" position to this new cell (one row down).
        *   **If Not White or Bottom:** If the cell below is not white (any color other than 0) *or* if the current yellow pixel is on the bottom row, stop the "falling" process for this pixel.
    *   **Repeat "Check Cell Below":** Continue checking and moving the yellow pixel down until a non-white cell or the bottom row is reached.
4. **Preserve other pixels:** All the pixels that are not of color 0 (white) or 4 (yellow) remain unchanged.
