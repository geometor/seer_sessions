The input and output grids have different dimensions in some cases, and sometimes they are the same size. The primary color involved appears to be '4' (yellow), with '1' (blue) and '7' (orange) playing secondary roles.  The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple mirroring, rotation, or direct color substitution. Instead, it looks like specific regions or patterns within the input grid are being selected or modified to create the output grid. The number of rows/columns relating to '7' seems key.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
