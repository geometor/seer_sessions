objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: large (input)
      - dimensions: small (output)
      - cells: colored pixels (0-9)

  - type: pixel_group
    properties:
      - color: single color value
      - shape: contiguous or non-contiguous regions
      - spatial_relationship: adjacent or non-adjacent

actions:
  - condense: map a larger grid to a smaller grid
  - represent: preserve key colors and spatial relationships
  - ignore: omit certain colors (background)

relationships:
  - input_grid_to_output_grid: many-to-one mapping of pixels
  - pixel_group_to_output_representation: spatial arrangement is a factor
