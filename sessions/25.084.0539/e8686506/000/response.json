The smaller grid seems to be a condensed representation of the larger grid, focusing on specific colors and their spatial relationships, possibly ignoring others (like the background color). It appears that spatially separated regions of the same color in the input may be represented as a connected (or at least adjacent) region in the output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Note areas where pixels of the same color are clustered together or form distinct shapes.\n\n3.  **Create Condensed Representation:**\n    *   Create a new, smaller output grid.\n    *   Traverse input grid in reading order (left to right, top to bottom), examining a window of variable size.\n    *    If the colors within the window, excluding the background color are the same, put the color into the output.\n    *   The color that appears earliest is prioritized, and later color occurrences that are the same are added.\n\n4.  **Output Grid:** The final output grid will be a smaller representation, capturing these relationships and color distributions. Essentially, each non-background color \"region\" in the input, even if discontinuous, gets reduced to a section in the output, and the positioning of colors will affect the order. The background color gets ignored.\n"
