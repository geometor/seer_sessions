Here's a breakdown of my thought process and the resulting Python code:

**Thought Process:**

1.  **Understanding the Rule:** The core rule is to identify '8's at the "corners" of connected '8' shapes and replace them with '1's. All other 8 should remain unchanged.

2.  **Corner Definition:** A corner '8' is defined as one that has zeros on its diagonal neighbors (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), or be bordered.

3.  **Implementation Strategy:**
    *   Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
    *   Check if the cell contains an '8'.
    *   If it's an '8', check its diagonal neighbors.
    *   If the diagonal neighbors conditions are met, it is a corner. Change this 8 to a 1 in the output grid.

4. **Edge Cases:** Ensure the code correctly handles '8's at the edges and corners of the entire grid (consider them as valid "corners" too).

**Python Code:**


```python
"""
The transformation identifies the number `8`s that are positioned in the corner of the shape they define,
and changes it to `1`. All other 8s are unchanged.

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all instances of the number `8` within the input grid.
2.  **Predicate - Check corners:** For each `8`, check if it's at corner, meaning, it's surrounded,
    from it's top-left, top-right, bottom-right and bottom-left by 0 or, in alternative,
    it is in contact with the border of the image.
3.  **Action - Replace:** If the conditions are met, perform these actions, change the corner `8` by a `1`.
4.  **Output Result**: maintain the other 8s in the grid
