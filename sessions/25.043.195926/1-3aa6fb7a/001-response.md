Okay, here's my attempt to describe the transformation from the input to the output grid:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all instances of the number `8` within the input grid.

2.  **Predicate - Check corners:** For each `8`, check if it's at corner, meaning, it's surrounded, from it's top-left, top-right, bottom-right and bottom-left by 0 or, in alternative, it is in contact with the border of the image.

3.  **Action - Replace:** If the conditions are met, perform these actions, change the corner `8` by a `1`.
4. **Output Result**: maintain the other 8s in the grid

**In simpler terms:**

The transformation identifies the number `8`s that are positioned in the corner of the shape they define, and changes it to `1`. All other 8s are unchanged.
