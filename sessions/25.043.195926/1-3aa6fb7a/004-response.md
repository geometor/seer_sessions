Here's the breakdown of the task and the solution:

**Task Overview:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numbers (represented as a 2D array or list of lists in Python).  The transformation rule needs to be inferred by observing the provided input and output grids (input_file_0.jpeg and input_file_1.jpeg). The goal is to write a Python function `transform(input_grid)` that correctly applies this rule to produce the output grid when given the input grid.

**Image Analysis and Rule Extraction:**

1.  **Visual Inspection:** I examined `input_file_0.jpeg` (input) and `input_file_1.jpeg` (output). The grids contain `0`s and `8`s. The `8`s are highlighted in blue in the input image and some are changed to `1` and highlighted in blue in output.

2.  **Identifying the Change:** The key difference between the input and output is the change of some `8`s to `1`s. The task is to identify *which* `8`s are changed.

3.  **Formulating the Rule:** By observing the input and the output, it becomes apparent that only the `8` values at the "corners" of groups of connected `8`s are changed to `1`. An `8` is determined to be at a corner if the cells diagonally adjacent to it are `0` or if it lies on the edge of the grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all instances of the digit `8` within the input grid.

2.  **Predicate - Check Corners:** For each `8`, determine if it's a "corner" `8`. An `8` is considered a corner if, for *each* of its diagonal directions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), *either* the diagonally adjacent cell is a `0` *or* the `8` is on the edge/border of the grid in that diagonal direction.

3.  **Action - Replace:** If an `8` is determined to be a corner `8`, replace it with a `1` in the output grid.

4.  **Output Result:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that all corner `8`s have been replaced with `1`s. All other digits remain unchanged.

**Python Code:**
