Okay, let's analyze the second example provided.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)]
      shape: Three separate L-shapes.

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)]
      shape: Three separate L-shapes.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
      shape: Single pixels replacing corners.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all azure (color 8) colored objects in the input grid. In this case, there are three distinct L-shaped objects.

2.  **Corner Detection:** Locate the interior corner of each "L" by finding a singular azure pixel that adjacent with two other azure pixels.

3. **Color Change:** Change each of those singular azure pixel to blue (color 1).

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

This transformation is consistent with the previous one. It identifies all the azure L-shaped objects and changes their interior corner pixels to blue.  All other pixels remain unchanged. The provided Python code should correctly handle this example as well.
