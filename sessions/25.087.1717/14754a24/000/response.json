In the output, a new color, red (2), appears.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes between input and output grids are localized. Only certain gray (5) pixels are modified. All other pixels retain their original color and position.\n4.  **Pattern of Change:** The gray (5) pixels that change to red (2) are always adjacent (sharing an edge, not just a corner) to yellow (4) pixels.\n5.  **Condition for Change:** Observing the locations where gray pixels change to red, it appears the condition is that the gray pixel must be orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to exactly *two* yellow (4) pixels. Gray pixels adjacent to zero, one, three, or four yellow pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
