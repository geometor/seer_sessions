The output grids introduce a third color: red (2).\n2.  **Grid Structure:** The grids are relatively large (18x18 in the examples) and contain scattered patterns of gray pixels on a white background. There doesn't appear to be a single large, dominant object.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing *some* of the white (0) pixels in the input grid to red (2) pixels in the output grid. The gray (5) pixels remain unchanged in their positions and color.\n4.  **Pattern Identification:** Comparing the input and output grids reveals that the change from white (0) to red (2) occurs specifically where a 2x2 square block of white pixels exists in the input. Every instance of such a 2x2 white block in the input corresponds to a 2x2 red block in the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through each possible top-left corner position (row `r`, column `c`) for a 2x2 block within the input grid. This means iterating `r` from 0 to `height - 2` and `c` from 0 to `width - 2`.\n3.  At each position (`r`, `c`), check if the pixel at (`r`, `c`), (`r+1`, `c`), (`r`, `c+1`), and (`r+1`, `c+1`) in the input grid are all white (0).\n4.  If all four pixels form a 2x2 white block, then update the corresponding four pixels at (`r`, `c`), (`r+1`, `c`), (`r`, `c+1`), and (`r+1`, `c+1`) in the *output* grid to red (2).\n5.  After checking all possible top-left corners, the final output grid contains the transformed result."
