Context:
  Input_Grid:
    Type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
    Colors_Present: [white (0), gray (5)]
    Structure: Background (white) with scattered gray patterns.
  Output_Grid:
    Type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
    Colors_Present: [white (0), gray (5), red (2)]
    Derivation: Modified version of Input_Grid.

Transformation:
  Action: Color Replacement
  Target_Object: 
    Name: White Block
    Shape: 2x2 square
    Composition: Four adjacent white (0) pixels.
    Location: Found within the Input_Grid.
  Rule:
    Condition: If a 2x2 block of white (0) pixels exists in the Input_Grid starting at position (row, col).
    Result: The corresponding four pixels at positions (row, col), (row+1, col), (row, col+1), and (row+1, col+1) in the Output_Grid are changed to red (2).
  Non_Target_Pixels:
    Rule: All pixels in the Input_Grid that are not part of a 2x2 white block remain unchanged in the Output_Grid. This includes gray (5) pixels and white (0) pixels not forming a 2x2 square with other white pixels.
