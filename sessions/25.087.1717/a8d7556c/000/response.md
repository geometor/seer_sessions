Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output grids consist primarily of two colors: white (0) and gray (5). The output grids introduce a third color: red (2).
2.  **Grid Structure:** The grids are relatively large (18x18 in the examples) and contain scattered patterns of gray pixels on a white background. There doesn't appear to be a single large, dominant object.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing *some* of the white (0) pixels in the input grid to red (2) pixels in the output grid. The gray (5) pixels remain unchanged in their positions and color.
4.  **Pattern Identification:** Comparing the input and output grids reveals that the change from white (0) to red (2) occurs specifically where a 2x2 square block of white pixels exists in the input. Every instance of such a 2x2 white block in the input corresponds to a 2x2 red block in the output.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Context:
  Input_Grid:
    Type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
    Colors_Present: [white (0), gray (5)]
    Structure: Background (white) with scattered gray patterns.
  Output_Grid:
    Type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
    Colors_Present: [white (0), gray (5), red (2)]
    Derivation: Modified version of Input_Grid.

Transformation:
  Action: Color Replacement
  Target_Object: 
    Name: White Block
    Shape: 2x2 square
    Composition: Four adjacent white (0) pixels.
    Location: Found within the Input_Grid.
  Rule:
    Condition: If a 2x2 block of white (0) pixels exists in the Input_Grid starting at position (row, col).
    Result: The corresponding four pixels at positions (row, col), (row+1, col), (row, col+1), and (row+1, col+1) in the Output_Grid are changed to red (2).
  Non_Target_Pixels:
    Rule: All pixels in the Input_Grid that are not part of a 2x2 white block remain unchanged in the Output_Grid. This includes gray (5) pixels and white (0) pixels not forming a 2x2 square with other white pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each possible top-left corner position (row `r`, column `c`) for a 2x2 block within the input grid. This means iterating `r` from 0 to `height - 2` and `c` from 0 to `width - 2`.
3.  At each position (`r`, `c`), check if the pixel at (`r`, `c`), (`r+1`, `c`), (`r`, `c+1`), and (`r+1`, `c+1`) in the input grid are all white (0).
4.  If all four pixels form a 2x2 white block, then update the corresponding four pixels at (`r`, `c`), (`r+1`, `c`), (`r`, `c+1`), and (`r+1`, `c+1`) in the *output* grid to red (2).
5.  After checking all possible top-left corners, the final output grid contains the transformed result.
