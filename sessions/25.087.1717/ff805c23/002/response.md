Okay, the programmatic search failed. This is unexpected. Let me re-check the expected outputs visually against the inputs.

**Example 1:**
Input:

```
...
[0 8 8 0 8 8 | 6 6 6 6 6 | 6 6 6 6 6 | 6 6 6 8 8 0 8 8 0] Row 6
[8 0 8 0 0 0 | 6 6 0 6 6 | 6 6 6 6 0 | 6 6 0 0 0 8 0 8] Row 7
[8 8 8 0 8 8 | 6 0 0 6 0 | 6 6 0 6 0 | 0 6 8 8 0 8 8 8] Row 8
[0 0 0 8 0 8 | 6 6 6 6 6 | 6 6 6 6 6 | 6 6 8 0 8 0 0 0] Row 9
[8 0 8 0 0 8 | 6 6 0 6 6 | 6 6 6 6 0 | 6 6 8 0 0 8 0 8] Row 10
...
[8 0 8 0 0 8 | 1 1 1 1 1 | 6 6 6 6 0 | 6 6 8 0 0 8 0 8] Row 13
[0 0 0 8 0 8 | 1 1 1 1 1 | 6 6 6 6 6 | 6 6 8 0 8 0 0 0] Row 14
[8 8 8 0 8 8 | 1 1 1 1 1 | 6 6 0 6 0 | 0 6 8 8 0 8 8 8] Row 15
[8 0 8 0 0 0 | 6 6 0 6 6 | 6 6 6 6 0 | 6 6 0 0 0 8 0 8] Row 16
[0 8 8 0 8 8 | 6 6 6 6 6 | 6 6 6 6 6 | 6 6 8 8 0 8 8 0] Row 17
... Columns ..... | 6 7 8 9 10| 11 12 13 14 15| 16 17 ...
```

Expected Output:

```
6 6 6 6 6
6 6 6 6 6
6 6 0 6 6
6 6 6 6 6
6 0 0 6 0
```

Let's try matching this visually again.
Look at input rows 13-17, columns 11-15:

```
6 6 6 6 0  <- Row 13
6 6 6 6 6  <- Row 14
6 6 0 6 0  <- Row 15
6 6 6 6 0  <- Row 16
6 6 6 6 6  <- Row 17
```

This is close but not identical to the expected output. The last element of row 13, 15, 16 are different. Why did the code search fail? Ah, maybe I copied the expected output incorrectly in the code block. Let me re-verify the expected output from the prompt display.

Okay, I see the issue. The website where the task might originate displays grids, and copying them might miss some nuances or slight differences. I will trust the programmatic search result: the *exact* 5x5 expected output grid does not appear contiguously within the input grid.

This implies the transformation is NOT simply extracting a subgrid.

Let's re-evaluate. What *is* happening?

**Observations:**
*   All inputs are 24x24. All outputs are 5x5.
*   There's often a central block of a distinct color in the input (Blue=1 in Ex1, Red=2 in Ex2, Gray=5 in Ex3).
*   There's often a 5x5 block of Blue=1 near the center in the input (Ex1: Rows 11-15, Cols 6-10; Ex3: Rows 15-19, Cols 10-14). Example 2 does *not* have a 5x5 block of Blue=1. It has Blue=1 in the top right corner (Rows 0-4, Cols 18-22).
*   The incorrect output generated by the previous code (extracting `Input[11:16, 10:15]`) always seems related to the area *near* the blue=1 block in examples 1 and 3.
    *   Ex 1: Incorrect output `[[1,0,0,6,6],[1,0,0,6,6],[1,6,6,6,6],[1,6,6,6,6],[1,6,6,0,6]]` vs Expected `[[6,6,6,6,6],[6,6,6,6,6],[6,6,0,6,6],[6,6,6,6,6],[6,0,0,6,0]]`. There's a relationship involving blue (1) and magenta (6).
    *   Ex 3: Incorrect output `[[5,0,0,5,5],[5,0,0,5,5],[0,5,5,0,5],[5,5,5,5,5],[1,1,1,1,1]]` vs Expected `[[0,5,5,0,5],[0,5,5,0,0],[5,5,5,5,0],[0,0,0,0,5],[0,0,0,0,5]]`. Related to gray (5) and blue (1).

**Hypothesis Revision:**

Could the blue (1) 5x5 block act as a "key" or "mask"?

*   **Hypothesis A:** Find the 5x5 blue block. Extract the 5x5 block from the *same position* in a different "layer" or pattern within the input? The input grids seem composed of different patterned regions.
    *   Ex 1: Blue block at (11, 6). The Magenta/White pattern seems to be centered around (11, 11) or slightly offset. Let's check Input[11:16, 11:16]. `[[0,0,6,6,6],[0,0,6,6,6],[6,6,6,6,0],[6,6,6,6,6],[6,6,0,6,0]]`. Still not matching. What about Input[13:18, 11:16]? `[[6,6,6,6,0],[6,6,6,6,6],[6,6,0,6,0],[6,6,6,0,6],[6,6,6,6,6]]`. Still no exact match.
    *   Ex 3: Blue block at (15, 10). Let's check Input[15:20, 10:15]. `[[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]`. This is the incorrect output! The code *was* extracting Input[11:16, 10:15]. Let's check that location again: `[[5,0,0,5,5],[5,0,0,5,5],[0,5,5,0,5],[5,5,5,5,5],[1,1,1,1,1]]`. This *was* the output produced by the previous code. So the location was fixed, but the comparison failed. Let me re-check the failed output from the prompt for Ex3.
    Ah, I see. The prompt shows:
    Transformed Output (Ex 3): `[[5,0,0,5,5],[5,0,0,5,5],[0,5,5,0,5],[5,5,5,5,5],[1,1,1,1,1]]`
    Expected Output (Ex 3): `[[0,5,5,0,5],[0,5,5,0,0],[5,5,5,5,0],[0,0,0,0,5],[0,0,0,0,5]]`
    These are indeed different. So the fixed location `[11:16, 10:15]` is definitely wrong.

Let's go back to the location finding. Maybe the location *is* determined by the blue block, but the transformation is more complex.

Where is the blue (1) 5x5 block?
*   Ex 1: Top-left at (11, 6).
*   Ex 2: No 5x5 blue block. There is a 5x5 blue block in the *output* pattern area (top-right). Input[0:5, 18:23] = `[[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]`.
*   Ex 3: Top-left at (15, 10).

Now, where are the *expected* outputs located if we search again? I need to be extremely careful copying the expected outputs.

Let's try the search again with corrected expected outputs.
