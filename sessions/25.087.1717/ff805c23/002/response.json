Ah, maybe I copied the expected output incorrectly in the code block. Let me re-verify the expected output from the prompt display.\n\nOkay, I see the issue. The website where the task might originate displays grids, and copying them might miss some nuances or slight differences. I will trust the programmatic search result: the *exact* 5x5 expected output grid does not appear contiguously within the input grid.\n\nThis implies the transformation is NOT simply extracting a subgrid.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. What *is* happening?\n\n**Observations:**\n*   All inputs are 24x24. All outputs are 5x5.\n*   There's often a central block of a distinct color in the input (Blue=1 in Ex1, Red=2 in Ex2, Gray=5 in Ex3).\n*   There's often a 5x5 block of Blue=1 near the center in the input (Ex1: Rows 11-15, Cols 6-10; Ex3: Rows 15-19, Cols 10-14). Example 2 does *not* have a 5x5 block of Blue=1. It has Blue=1 in the top right corner (Rows 0-4, Cols 18-22).\n*   The incorrect output generated by the previous code (extracting `Input[11:16, 10:15]`) always seems related to the area *near* the blue=1 block in examples 1 and 3.\n    *   Ex 1: Incorrect output `[[1,0,0,6,6],[1,0,0,6,6],[1,6,6,6,6],[1,6,6,6,6],[1,6,6,0,6]]` vs Expected `[[6,6,6,6,6],[6,6,6,6,6],[6,6,0,6,6],[6,6,6,6,6],[6,0,0,6,0]]`. There's a relationship involving blue (1) and magenta (6).\n    *   Ex 3: Incorrect output `[[5,0,0,5,5],[5,0,0,5,5],[0,5,5,0,5],[5,5,5,5,5],[1,1,1,1,1]]` vs Expected `[[0,5,5,0,5],[0,5,5,0,0],[5,5,5,5,0],[0,0,0,0,5],[0,0,0,0,5]]`. Related to gray (5) and blue (1).\n\n**Hypothesis Revision:**\n\nCould the blue (1) 5x5 block act as a \"key\" or \"mask\"?\n\n*   **Hypothesis A:** Find the 5x5 blue block. Extract the 5x5 block from the *same position* in a different \"layer\" or pattern within the input? The input grids seem composed of different patterned regions.\n    *   Ex 1: Blue block at (11, 6). The Magenta/White pattern seems to be centered around (11, 11) or slightly offset. Let's check Input[11:16, 11:16]. `[[0,0,6,6,6],[0,0,6,6,6],[6,6,6,6,0],[6,6,6,6,6],[6,6,0,6,0]]`. Still not matching. What about Input[13:18, 11:16]? `[[6,6,6,6,0],[6,6,6,6,6],[6,6,0,6,0],[6,6,6,0,6],[6,6,6,6,6]]`. Still no exact match.\n    *   Ex 3: Blue block at (15, 10). Let's check Input[15:20, 10:15]. `[[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]`. This is the incorrect output! The code *was* extracting Input[11:16, 10:15]. Let's check that location again: `[[5,0,0,5,5],[5,0,0,5,5],[0,5,5,0,5],[5,5,5,5,5],[1,1,1,1,1]]`. This *was* the output produced by the previous code. So the location was fixed, but the comparison failed. Let me re-check the failed output from the prompt for Ex3.\n    Ah, I see. The prompt shows:\n    Transformed Output (Ex 3): `[[5,0,0,5,5],[5,0,0,5,5],[0,5,5,0,5],[5,5,5,5,5],[1,1,1,1,1]]`\n    Expected Output (Ex 3): `[[0,5,5,0,5],[0,5,5,0,0],[5,5,5,5,0],[0,0,0,0,5],[0,0,0,0,5]]`\n    These are indeed different. So the fixed location `[11:16, 10:15]` is definitely wrong.\n\nLet's go back to the location finding. Maybe the location *is* determined by the blue block, but the transformation is more complex.\n\nWhere is the blue (1) 5x5 block?\n*   Ex 1: Top-left at (11, 6).\n*   Ex 2: No 5x5 blue block. There is a 5x5 blue block in the *output* pattern area (top-right). Input[0:5, 18:23] = `[[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]`.\n*   Ex 3: Top-left at (15, 10).\n\nNow, where are the *expected* outputs located if we search again? I need to be extremely careful copying the expected outputs.\n\nLet's try the search again with corrected expected outputs.\n\n"
