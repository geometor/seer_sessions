            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully identified the core mechanism for Example 2: locating a grid of 3x3 hollow gray templates and a separate \"key\" region, then using the colors from the key region (mapped positionally) to replace the gray pixels of the corresponding templates.\n\nHowever, the code failed on Example 1 because the method for identifying the \"key\" region was flawed. The previous logic identified *all* non-gray, non-background pixels outside the templates and calculated their overall bounding box. In Example 1, this bounding box (5x4) did not match the dimensions of the template grid (4x4), causing the transformation to abort. Example 2 worked because the bounding box of *all* such pixels happened to match the template grid dimensions (3x5).\n\nThe strategy for resolving the error is to revise the definition and identification of the \"key\" region. Instead of using the bounding box of *all* potential key pixels, the new approach should:\n1.  Determine the dimensions (height `tr`, width `tc`) of the template grid.\n2.  Find the single, top-leftmost pixel in the input grid that is neither background (0) nor gray (5) and is not part of any template's gray pixels. This pixel serves as the anchor `(key_min_r, key_min_c)` for the key region.\n3.  Define the key region as the subgrid of size `tr` x `tc` starting at the anchor `(key_min_r, key_min_c)`.\n4.  Proceed with mapping colors from this correctly defined key region to the template grid. This removes the need for the explicit dimension validation step, as the key region is now constructed to match the template grid size.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's gather metrics based on the proposed revised logic.\n\n"

For each template found, record the set of coordinates for its 8 gray border pixels and the coordinate of its top-left corner.\n3.  **Handle No Templates:** If no template instances are found, return the initial output grid (the unchanged copy of the input).\n4.  **Determine Template Grid Structure:**\n    a.  Collect the top-left corner coordinates of all found template instances.\n    b.  Determine the sorted list of unique row indices and unique column indices from these corners.\n    c.  The number of unique rows is the template grid height (`tr`).\n    d.  The number of unique columns is the template grid width (`tc`).\n    e.  Create a mapping (e.g., a dictionary) where keys are logical grid indices `(r_idx, c_idx)` (from `(0,0)` to `(tr-1, tc-1)`) and values are the corresponding template objects found at that logical position in the grid.\n5.  **Identify Key Region Anchor:**\n    a.  Create a set containing the coordinates of all gray pixels belonging to *any* identified template instance.\n    b.  Scan the input grid row by row, column by column, to find the first pixel `(r, c)` that meets all the following criteria:\n        i.  Its color is not background (0).\n        ii. Its color is not gray (5).\n        iii. Its coordinate `(r, c)` is not in the set of template pixels identified in step 5a.\n    c.  Record the coordinate `(r, c)` of this first matching pixel as the key region anchor `(key_min_r, key_min_c)`.\n6.  **Handle No Anchor:** If no anchor pixel is found (meaning there are no non-background, non-gray pixels outside the templates), return the initial output grid.\n7.  **Apply Transformation:** Iterate through each logical position `(r_idx, c_idx)` of the template grid (from `(0, 0)` up to `(tr-1, tc-1)`).\n    a.  Check if a template instance exists at this logical position using the mapping created in step 4e.\n    b.  If a template exists at `(r_idx, c_idx)`:\n        i.  Calculate the corresponding source coordinate within the key region in the original input grid: `src_r = key_min_r + r_idx`, `src_c = key_min_c + c_idx`.\n        ii. Retrieve the replacement color from the *original input grid* at `(src_r, src_c)`. Handle potential out-of-bounds access if `src_r` or `src_c` fall outside the input grid dimensions (though this shouldn't happen if an anchor was found correctly).\n        iii. Retrieve the set of 8 gray pixel coordinates associated with the current template instance `(r_idx, c_idx)`.\n        iv. For each coordinate `(px_r, px_c)` in this set, update the color of the pixel at `(px_r, px_c)` in the *output grid* to the retrieved replacement color.\n8.  **Return Result:** Return the modified output grid."
