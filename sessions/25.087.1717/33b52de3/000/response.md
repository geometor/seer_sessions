Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels. The overall size and background color (white) remain consistent.
2.  **Key Components in Input:**
    *   **Template Area:** A distinct region containing multiple instances of a repeating pattern. In both examples, this pattern is a 3x3 hollow square made of gray (5) pixels, arranged in a larger grid formation with white (0) pixels separating them.
    *   **Key/Palette Area:** Another distinct region containing a compact block of various colored pixels (blue, azure, yellow in train\_1; red, blue, green in train\_2). This area is separate from the template area.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the template patterns (the gray squares). The original gray color is replaced by a new color.
4.  **Color Source:** The new colors used to replace the gray in the output correspond directly to the colors found in the key/palette area of the input.
5.  **Mapping Logic:** The position of each gray template pattern within its grid structure dictates which color from the key/palette area is used for replacement. If the gray patterns form an N x M grid, the color for the pattern at row `i`, column `j` (within the template grid) is taken from the key/palette pattern at its corresponding relative position `(i, j)`.
6.  **Invariant Elements:** The background pixels (white) and the pixels within the key/palette area remain unchanged in the output.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: background
      - color: white (0)
      - structure: 2D array of pixels
  - object: template_pattern
    properties:
      - shape: 3x3 hollow square
      - color: gray (5)
      - role: placeholder to be recolored
  - object: template_grid
    properties:
      - composition: multiple instances of template_pattern
      - arrangement: regular grid with white pixel separators
      - location: distinct area within the main grid (e.g., upper-right, upper-middle)
  - object: key_pattern
    properties:
      - shape: rectangular block of various colors
      - role: source of replacement colors
      - location: distinct area, separate from template_grid (e.g., middle-left, bottom-left)
      - structure: defines the color mapping based on position

actions:
  - name: identify
    parameters:
      - target: template_pattern (gray 3x3 hollow square)
      - target: template_grid (grid of gray patterns)
      - target: key_pattern (separate block of colors)
  - name: map_color
    parameters:
      - source: key_pattern
      - target: template_pattern instance within template_grid
      - mechanism: relative position matching (row, col index within template_grid maps to row, col index within key_pattern)
  - name: replace_color
    parameters:
      - target: pixels of each template_pattern instance
      - old_color: gray (5)
      - new_color: color determined by map_color action

relationships:
  - type: positional_mapping
    source: key_pattern
    target: template_grid
    details: The color of a pixel at relative position (r, c) within the key_pattern determines the color that replaces the gray pixels in the template_pattern instance located at relative position (r, c) within the template_grid.
  - type: invariance
    elements:
      - background pixels
      - key_pattern pixels
    details: These elements are copied directly from input to output without modification.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the "key pattern" object: Locate a contiguous rectangular block of non-white pixels that is spatially separated from other major structures. Note its dimensions (height `kh`, width `kw`) and top-left corner coordinates (`kr`, `kc`).
3.  Identify the "template pattern" object: Recognize the repeating shape and color used as a placeholder (e.g., the 3x3 hollow gray square). Note its color (e.g., gray=5).
4.  Identify the "template grid" structure: Locate all instances of the template pattern in the input grid. Determine the grid dimensions of this structure (number of rows `tr`, number of columns `tc`) by observing how the template patterns are arranged. Ensure `tr` equals `kh` and `tc` equals `kw`.
5.  Iterate through each position `(r, c)` within the template grid, where `r` ranges from 0 to `tr-1` and `c` ranges from 0 to `tc-1`.
6.  For each position `(r, c)`:
    a.  Determine the location (coordinates) of the corresponding template pattern instance in the input grid.
    b.  Retrieve the target replacement color from the key pattern at relative coordinates `(r, c)` within the key pattern object (i.e., input\_grid[`kr + r`][`kc + c`]).
    c.  Find all pixels belonging to the template pattern instance identified in step 6a that have the original template color (gray=5).
    d.  In the output grid, change the color of these specific pixels (identified in step 6c) to the target replacement color (retrieved in step 6b).
7.  Return the modified output grid.
