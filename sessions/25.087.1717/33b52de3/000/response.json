            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels. The overall size and background color (white) remain consistent.\n2.  **Key Components in Input:**\n    *   **Template Area:** A distinct region containing multiple instances of a repeating pattern. In both examples, this pattern is a 3x3 hollow square made of gray (5) pixels, arranged in a larger grid formation with white (0) pixels separating them.\n    *   **Key/Palette Area:** Another distinct region containing a compact block of various colored pixels (blue, azure, yellow in train\\_1; red, blue, green in train\\_2). This area is separate from the template area.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the template patterns (the gray squares). The original gray color is replaced by a new color.\n4.  **Color Source:** The new colors used to replace the gray in the output correspond directly to the colors found in the key/palette area of the input.\n5.  **Mapping Logic:** The position of each gray template pattern within its grid structure dictates which color from the key/palette area is used for replacement. If the gray patterns form an N x M grid, the color for the pattern at row `i`, column `j` (within the template grid) is taken from the key/palette pattern at its corresponding relative position `(i, j)`.\n6.  **Invariant Elements:** The background pixels (white) and the pixels within the key/palette area remain unchanged in the output.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Identify the \"key pattern\" object: Locate a contiguous rectangular block of non-white pixels that is spatially separated from other major structures. Note its dimensions (height `kh`, width `kw`) and top-left corner coordinates (`kr`, `kc`).\n3.  Identify the \"template pattern\" object: Recognize the repeating shape and color used as a placeholder (e.g., the 3x3 hollow gray square). Note its color (e.g., gray=5).\n4.  Identify the \"template grid\" structure: Locate all instances of the template pattern in the input grid. Determine the grid dimensions of this structure (number of rows `tr`, number of columns `tc`) by observing how the template patterns are arranged. Ensure `tr` equals `kh` and `tc` equals `kw`.\n5.  Iterate through each position `(r, c)` within the template grid, where `r` ranges from 0 to `tr-1` and `c` ranges from 0 to `tc-1`.\n6.  For each position `(r, c)`:\n    a.  Determine the location (coordinates) of the corresponding template pattern instance in the input grid.\n    b.  Retrieve the target replacement color from the key pattern at relative coordinates `(r, c)` within the key pattern object (i.e., input\\_grid[`kr + r`][`kc + c`]).\n    c.  Find all pixels belonging to the template pattern instance identified in step 6a that have the original template color (gray=5).\n    d.
