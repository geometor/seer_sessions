task_description: Replace pixels within repeating template patterns using colors from a key pattern based on relative grid positions.

definitions:
  - object: background
    pixels: Color 0 (white).
  - object: template_pattern
    description: A specific 3x3 hollow square shape made of gray (5) pixels.
    properties: [shape(3x3, hollow_square), color(gray)]
  - object: template_grid
    description: A grid arrangement of multiple template_pattern instances.
    properties: [rows(tr), cols(tc), derived_from(template_pattern locations)]
  - object: key_pattern
    description: A contiguous rectangular block of non-background, non-gray pixels.
    properties: [shape(rectangle), height(tr), width(tc), colors(various), location(spatially_separate_from_template_grid)]
    constraints: Its dimensions (height, width) must match the template_grid dimensions (tr, tc).

transformation:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify all instances of the 'template_pattern' (3x3 hollow gray squares) in the input grid.
  - step: 2
    action: Determine the dimensions ('tr' rows, 'tc' columns) of the 'template_grid' based on the relative row and column positions of the identified template_patterns.
  - step: 3
    action: Identify potential 'key_pattern' objects.
    details: Find all contiguous blocks of non-background (0) and non-gray (5) pixels.
  - step: 4
    action: Select the correct 'key_pattern' from the potential candidates.
    details: Choose the candidate object whose height matches 'tr' and whose width matches 'tc'. Record its top-left corner (key_r, key_c).
  - step: 5
    action: Create an output grid, initially a copy of the input grid.
  - step: 6
    action: Iterate through the conceptual 'template_grid' positions (row_index from 0 to tr-1, col_index from 0 to tc-1).
  - step: 7
    action: For each (row_index, col_index), find the corresponding 'template_pattern' instance in the input grid.
  - step: 8
    action: Determine the replacement color from the 'key_pattern' block in the *input* grid at the relative position (key_r + row_index, key_c + col_index).
  - step: 9
    action: In the output grid, change the color of all gray (5) pixels belonging to the current 'template_pattern' instance to the replacement color found in step 8.
  - step: 10
    action: Return the modified output grid.
