Transformation Rule:

1.  **Identify Template Patterns:** Scan the input grid to find all occurrences of the specific template pattern: a 3x3 hollow square composed entirely of gray (5) pixels. Record the location (top-left corner) and pixels of each found template instance. If no templates are found, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  **Determine Template Grid Dimensions:** Analyze the top-left corner coordinates of the found template instances. Identify the unique row coordinates and unique column coordinates. The number of unique rows is the template grid height (`tr`), and the number of unique columns is the template grid width (`tc`). Create a mapping from template grid indices `(r_idx, c_idx)` (where `0 <= r_idx < tr`, `0 <= c_idx < tc`) to the corresponding template pattern instance based on its original top-left corner matching the sorted unique rows/cols.
3.  **Isolate Potential Key Pixels:** Create a temporary copy of the input grid. In this temporary grid, set the color of all pixels belonging to any identified template pattern instance to background (0).
4.  **Identify Key Pattern Object:** Find all distinct contiguous objects in the temporary grid consisting of any non-background color (i.e., colors 1-9). Gray pixels (5) should not form part of these objects as they were either part of templates (now 0) or potentially other gray structures which are ignored here.
5.  **Select the Key Pattern:** From the objects found in step 4, identify the *single* object whose bounding box height is exactly `tr` and whose bounding box width is exactly `tc`. If no such object or multiple such objects exist, return the input grid unchanged. Record the top-left corner `(key_r, key_c)` of this identified key pattern object's bounding box.
6.  **Prepare Output:** Create the output grid as a copy of the original input grid.
7.  **Apply Transformation:** Iterate through each template grid index `(r_idx, c_idx)` from `(0, 0)` up to `(tr-1, tc-1)`.
    a.  Retrieve the specific template pattern instance corresponding to `(r_idx, c_idx)` using the mapping created in step 2. If no template exists at this grid index, skip.
    b.  Get the replacement color from the *original input grid* at the location `(key_r + r_idx, key_c + c_idx)`.
    c.  For every pixel `(px_r, px_c)` that belongs to the current template pattern instance (which will have the color gray (5) in the output grid initially), update its color in the *output grid* to the replacement color obtained in step 7b.
8.  **Return Result:** Return the modified output grid.

Hold on, the metrics calculation indicates that `find_template_objects` found *zero* templates in Example 1. This contradicts my earlier assumption and the visual inspection. Let's re-examine `find_template_objects` and Example 1's input.

The `find_template_objects` logic searches for *contiguous* gray objects and then checks if they match the 3x3 hollow shape.

**Example 1 Input Structure:**

```
... 5 5 5 ... 5 5 5 ...
... 0 5 0 ... 0 5 0 ...
... 5 5 5 ... 5 5 5 ...
```

This is the hollow 3x3 gray square. My `find_template_objects` function should have found these. Let's re-run the check specifically for templates on Example 1, perhaps with some debug prints inside the function (although I can't add prints in the `tool_code` directly).

Maybe the issue is in the `find_template_objects` BFS logic or the way `visited` is handled?
The BFS explores connected gray pixels. If it hits a non-gray pixel, it flags `is_potential_template = False`. It correctly identifies the bounds. It checks `bbox_h == 3 and bbox_w == 3`. It calculates `expected_pixels` for a hollow square based on the bounds. It compares `current_component_pixels` with `expected_pixels`.

Could the `visited` array be causing issues if multiple template searches start near each other? The BFS marks visited gray pixels. If another search starts on a gray pixel already visited by a previous BFS (even if that BFS determined it wasn't a template), it won't start. This seems correct.

Let's reconsider the `is_potential_template` logic. It's set to `False` if `grid[row, col] != gray` during the BFS *or* if a connected neighbor is non-gray and non-zero. Is it possible that some gray pixels that *are* part of a template are adjacent to non-gray, non-zero pixels (like the key pixels in Example 1)?

Looking at Example 1:
Template at (1, 6) to (3, 8):

```
5 5 5
0 5 0
5 5 5
```

All pixels are gray or background(0). Neighbors are mostly 0.
Template at (1, 10) to (3, 12): Same.
Template at (5, 6) to (7, 8):

```
5 5 5
0 5 0
5 5 5
```

Pixel (5, 6) is adjacent to key pixel (5, 5) [color 1]. Pixel (6, 6) is adjacent to key pixel (6, 5) [color 1]. Pixel (7, 6) is adjacent to background (7, 5) [color 0].
Pixel (5, 8) is adjacent to background (5, 9) [color 0]. Pixel (6, 8) is adjacent to background (6, 9) [color 0]. Pixel (7, 8) is adjacent to background (7, 9) [color 0].
The logic `elif neighbor_color != 0:` would trigger `is_potential_template = False` if the BFS explores from a pixel like (5, 6) and checks its left neighbor (5, 5).

**Revised `find_template_objects` strategy:**
The check for `is_potential_template` based on non-gray neighbors might be too strict. A template should only consist of gray pixels itself, but it *can* be adjacent to other colors. The check should focus only on the pixels *within* the component found by the BFS. If *any* pixel added to `current_component_pixels` is not gray, *then* it's not a valid template component. Adjacency to outside non-gray colors shouldn't invalidate it.

Let's try simulating the refined check:
1. Start BFS from a gray pixel `(r, c)`.
2. Only add *gray* neighbors to the queue. Mark them visited.
3. Collect all visited gray pixels in `current_component_pixels`.
4. Track `min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c` for these gray pixels.
5. After the BFS (for the gray component) finishes, check if the component size is 3x3.
6. If 3x3, check if `current_component_pixels` exactly matches the hollow square pattern based on the bounds.
7. If all checks pass, it's a template.

Let's re-run the metrics calculation with this understanding (modifying the function mentally, as I can't edit the `tool_code` function after execution). The previous `find_template_objects` code *already* mostly did this, but the `is_potential_template` flag might have been tripped incorrectly. Let's look closely at the code provided for `find_template_objects`:


```python
# ... BFS setup ...
while component_q:
    row, col = component_q.popleft()
    # If a non-gray pixel somehow got into the queue (shouldn't happen if we only add gray neighbors)
    # Or if the *starting* pixel wasn't gray (handled by outer loop check)
    if grid[row,col] != gray:
         is_potential_template = False # This seems okay

    current_component_pixels.add((row, col))
    # ... update bounds ...

    # Explore neighbors (4-connectivity)
    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
        if 0 <= nr < h and 0 <= nc < w and not visited[nr, nc]:
            neighbor_color = grid[nr,nc]
            if neighbor_color == gray: # ONLY add gray neighbors to queue
                visited[nr, nc] = True
                component_q.append((nr, nc))
            # This 'elif' might be the problem
            elif neighbor_color != 0: # Check non-background, non-gray connection
                 is_potential_template = False # <<<<< PROBLEM: Adjacent non-gray pixel disqualifies template
```

Yes, the `elif neighbor_color != 0: is_potential_template = False` line is the likely culprit. It incorrectly disqualifies a purely gray component just because it touches a non-gray, non-background pixel. Removing this `elif` block should fix the template finding.

Let's assume the template finding works correctly now. The metrics for Example 1 *should* be:
- `ex1_template_count`: 16
- `ex1_template_grid_dims`: (4, 4)
- `ex1_key_pixel_count`: 16 (The colored pixels 1, 8, 4)
- `ex1_key_bbox_topleft`: (3, 1)
- `ex1_key_bbox_dims`: (4, 4) (From (3,1) to (6,4))
- `ex1_dims_match`: True
- `ex1_old_logic_match`: False (Because the key pixels are not one contiguous object)

The metrics for Example 2 remain the same and correct.

So, the original assessment that the failure was due to the key pattern not being a single contiguous object holds, but it was preceded by a failure to even *find* the templates in Example 1 due to a bug in `find_template_objects`.

**Final Strategy Confirmation:**
1.  Fix `find_template_objects` by removing the check that disqualifies templates adjacent to non-gray colors.
2.  Identify all template instances using the fixed function.
3.  Determine template grid dimensions (`tr`, `tc`) and the mapping from grid index to template instance.
4.  Find *all* pixels in the input grid that are: a) not background (0), b) not gray (5), and c) not part of any identified template instance. These are the "key source pixels".
5.  Calculate the bounding box (`key_min_r`, `key_min_c`, `key_max_r`, `key_max_c`) encompassing *all* key source pixels.
6.  Calculate the height (`key_h`) and width (`key_w`) of this bounding box.
7.  If `key_h != tr` or `key_w != tc`, the pattern doesn't match; return the input grid unchanged.
8.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
9.  Iterate through template grid indices `(r_idx, c_idx)` from `(0,0)` to `(tr-1, tc-1)`.
10. If a template instance exists at `(r_idx, c_idx)`:
    a. Determine the corresponding source coordinate in the original input grid: `(src_r, src_c) = (key_min_r + r_idx, key_min_c + c_idx)`.
    b. Get the replacement color from `input_grid[src_r, src_c]`.
    c. For each pixel `(px_r, px_c)` belonging to this template instance, set `output_grid[px_r, px_c]` to the replacement color.
11. Return the output grid.

This revised strategy correctly identifies templates and uses the bounding box of all non-template, non-gray, non-background pixels to define the key grid, reading colors directly from the original input grid based on relative position.Okay, let's break down the analysis and refine the approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code successfully solved Example 2 but failed on Example 1. The failure report showed that the transformed output for Example 1 was identical to the input, meaning the transformation logic was not applied.

*   **Initial Hypothesis & Correction:** My initial thought was that the failure was solely due to Example 1 having a non-contiguous "key" pattern, which the `find_contiguous_objects` logic wouldn't select. However, the metrics calculated using the provided `find_template_objects` function revealed a deeper issue: **zero templates were detected in Example 1**.
*   **Root Cause:** Analysis of the `find_template_objects` function showed a flaw: it incorrectly disqualified a potential template object if any of its constituent gray pixels were adjacent to a non-gray, non-background pixel (colors 1-4, 6-9). This occurred in Example 1 where the key pixels are adjacent to some template pixels. This check needs to be removed; adjacency should not invalidate a template composed purely of gray pixels in the correct hollow 3x3 shape.
*   **Revised Strategy:**
    1.  Correct the `find_template_objects` function to reliably identify all 3x3 hollow gray squares, regardless of adjacent pixels.
    2.  Implement the transformation logic based on the *bounding box* of *all* relevant "key source" pixels (non-template, non-gray, non-background), rather than requiring a single contiguous key object.
    3.  Ensure the dimensions of the template grid arrangement match the dimensions of the key source pixels' bounding box.
    4.  Map colors from the original input grid locations corresponding to the key source bounding box onto the template pixels.

**Metrics Gathering**

Based on the re-evaluation (assuming a corrected `find_template_objects`):

*   **Example 1 (Failure Case):**
    *   Input Grid Size: 23x23
    *   Templates Found (Expected): 16 (arranged in a 4x4 grid)
    *   Template Grid Dimensions (`tr`, `tc`): (4, 4)
    *   Key Source Pixels (Colors 1, 8, 4 outside templates): 16 pixels
    *   Key Source Bounding Box Top-Left: (3, 1)
    *   Key Source Bounding Box Dimensions: (4, 4) (rows 3-6, cols 1-4)
    *   Dimensions Match (`tr`==`key_h`, `tc`==`key_w`): True
    *   Failure Reason (Original Code): Incorrect `find_template_objects` (found 0 templates). Even if templates were found, the old key finding logic (`find_contiguous_objects` searching for a single `tr`x`tc` object) would have failed because the key pixels are not contiguous.
    *   Expected Output vs. Input: Gray template pixels are replaced by colors from the 4x4 key region.

*   **Example 2 (Success Case):**
    *   Input Grid Size: 23x23
    *   Templates Found: 15 (arranged in a 3x5 grid)
    *   Template Grid Dimensions (`tr`, `tc`): (3, 5)
    *   Key Source Pixels (Colors 1, 2, 3 outside templates): 15 pixels
    *   Key Source Bounding Box Top-Left: (19, 1)
    *   Key Source Bounding Box Dimensions: (3, 5) (rows 19-21, cols 1-5)
    *   Dimensions Match (`tr`==`key_h`, `tc`==`key_w`): True
    *   Success Reason (Original Code): `find_template_objects` worked (templates weren't adjacent to problematic colors), *and* the key source pixels formed a single contiguous object matching the required dimensions.
    *   Expected Output vs. Input: Gray template pixels are replaced by colors from the 3x5 key region.

    output: modified_output_grid
    details: Iterate through the template grid (r_idx, c_idx). For each corresponding template instance, find the source color in the original input_grid at (key_min_r + r_idx, key_min_c + c_idx) and replace the gray pixels of the template instance in the output_grid with this source color.

edge_cases:
  - condition: No templates found.
    action: Return the input grid unchanged.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Templates:** Scan the input grid to find all instances of the template pattern: a 3x3 hollow square made entirely of gray pixels. Record the set of pixels belonging to each template instance. If no templates are found, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  **Determine Template Grid Structure:** Analyze the locations (e.g., top-left corners) of the found template instances. Determine the number of unique rows (`tr`) and unique columns (`tc`) these templates occupy, effectively defining the dimensions of a "template grid". Create a mapping to easily access the specific template instance corresponding to each logical grid position `(r_idx, c_idx)`, where `0 <= r_idx < tr` and `0 <= c_idx < tc`.
3.  **Identify Key Source Pixels:** Create a set of all pixels in the input grid that meet three criteria: (a) are not background color (0), (b) are not gray color (5), and (c) are not part of any pixel set belonging to the templates identified in step 1. If no such pixels are found, return the input grid unchanged.
4.  **Determine Key Source Bounding Box:** Calculate the minimum bounding box that encloses all the key source pixels identified in step 3. Record its top-left corner `(key_min_r, key_min_c)`, its height `key_h`, and its width `key_w`.
5.  **Validate Dimensions:** Check if the template grid height `tr` is equal to the key source bounding box height `key_h`, AND if the template grid width `tc` is equal to the key source bounding box width `key_w`. If these dimensions do not match, return the input grid unchanged.
6.  **Prepare Output Grid:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
7.  **Apply Transformation:** Iterate through each logical position `(r_idx, c_idx)` of the template grid (from `(0, 0)` to `(tr-1, tc-1)`).
    a.  Check if a template instance exists at this logical position using the mapping from step 2.
    b.  If a template exists:
        i.  Determine the corresponding source coordinate within the key region: `src_r = key_min_r + r_idx`, `src_c = key_min_c + c_idx`.
        ii. Retrieve the replacement color from the *original input grid* at `(src_r, src_c)`.
        iii. For every pixel `(px_r, px_c)` belonging to the current template instance (identified in step 1), update its color in the *output grid* to the retrieved replacement color.
8.  **Return Result:** Return the modified output grid.
