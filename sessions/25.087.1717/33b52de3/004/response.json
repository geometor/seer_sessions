Let's re-run the check specifically for templates on Example 1, perhaps with some debug prints inside the function (although I can't add prints in the `tool_code` directly).\n\nMaybe the issue is in the `find_template_objects` BFS logic or the way `visited` is handled?\nThe BFS explores connected gray pixels. If it hits a non-gray pixel, it flags `is_potential_template = False`. It correctly identifies the bounds. It checks `bbox_h == 3 and bbox_w == 3`. It calculates `expected_pixels` for a hollow square based on the bounds. It compares `current_component_pixels` with `expected_pixels`.\n\nCould the `visited` array be causing issues if multiple template searches start near each other? The BFS marks visited gray pixels. If another search starts on a gray pixel already visited by a previous BFS (even if that BFS determined it wasn't a template), it won't start. This seems correct.\n\nLet's reconsider the `is_potential_template` logic. It's set to `False` if `grid[row, col] != gray` during the BFS *or* if a connected neighbor is non-gray and non-zero. Is it possible that some gray pixels that *are* part of a template are adjacent to non-gray, non-zero pixels (like the key pixels in Example 1)?\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nTemplate at (1, 6) to (3, 8):\n"

Pixel (7, 8) is adjacent to background (7, 9) [color 0].\nThe logic `elif neighbor_color != 0:` would trigger `is_potential_template = False` if the BFS explores from a pixel like (5, 6) and checks its left neighbor (5, 5).\n\n**Revised `find_template_objects` strategy:**\nThe check for `is_potential_template` based on non-gray neighbors might be too strict. A template should only consist of gray pixels itself, but it *can* be adjacent to other colors. The check should focus only on the pixels *within* the component found by the BFS. If *any* pixel added to `current_component_pixels` is not gray, *then* it's not a valid template component. Adjacency to outside non-gray colors shouldn't invalidate it.\n\nLet's try simulating the refined check:\n1. Start BFS from a gray pixel `(r, c)`.\n2. Only add *gray* neighbors to the queue. Mark them visited.\n3. Collect all visited gray pixels in `current_component_pixels`.\n4. Track `min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c` for these gray pixels.\n5. After the BFS (for the gray component) finishes, check if the component size is 3x3.\n6. If 3x3, check if `current_component_pixels` exactly matches the hollow square pattern based on the bounds.\n7. If all checks pass, it's a template.\n\nLet's re-run the metrics calculation with this understanding (modifying the function mentally, as I can't edit the `tool_code` function after execution). The previous `find_template_objects` code *already* mostly did this, but the `is_potential_template` flag might have been tripped incorrectly. Let's look closely at the code provided for `find_template_objects`:\n\n"

            "text": "\nYes, the `elif neighbor_color != 0: is_potential_template = False` line is the likely culprit. It incorrectly disqualifies a purely gray component just because it touches a non-gray, non-background pixel. Removing this `elif` block should fix the template finding.\n\nLet's assume the template finding works correctly now. The metrics for Example 1 *should* be:\n- `ex1_template_count`: 16\n- `ex1_template_grid_dims`: (4, 4)\n- `ex1_key_pixel_count`: 16 (The colored pixels 1, 8, 4)\n- `ex1_key_bbox_topleft`: (3, 1)\n- `ex1_key_bbox_dims`: (4, 4) (From (3,1) to (6,4))\n- `ex1_dims_match`: True\n- `ex1_old_logic_match`: False (Because the key pixels are not one contiguous object)\n\nThe metrics for Example 2 remain the same and correct.\n\nSo, the original assessment that the failure was due to the key pattern not being a single contiguous object holds, but it was preceded by a failure to even *find* the templates in Example 1 due to a bug in `find_template_objects`.\n\n**Final Strategy Confirmation:**\n1.  Fix `find_template_objects` by removing the check that disqualifies templates adjacent to non-gray colors.\n2.  Identify all template instances using the fixed function.\n3.  Determine template grid dimensions (`tr`, `tc`) and the mapping from grid index to template instance.\n4.  Find *all* pixels in the input grid that are: a) not background (0), b) not gray (5), and c) not part of any identified template instance. These are the \"key source pixels\".\n5.  Calculate the bounding box (`key_min_r`, `key_min_c`, `key_max_r`, `key_max_c`) encompassing *all* key source pixels.\n6.  Calculate the height (`key_h`) and width (`key_w`) of this bounding box.\n7.  If `key_h != tr` or `key_w != tc`, the pattern doesn't match; return the input grid unchanged.\n8.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n9.  Iterate through template grid indices `(r_idx, c_idx)` from `(0,0)` to `(tr-1, tc-1)`.\n10. If a template instance exists at `(r_idx, c_idx)`:\n    a. Determine the corresponding source coordinate in the original input grid: `(src_r, src_c) = (key_min_r + r_idx, key_min_c + c_idx)`.\n    b. Get the replacement color from `input_grid[src_r, src_c]`.\n    c. For each pixel `(px_r, px_c)` belonging to this template instance, set `output_grid[px_r, px_c]` to the replacement color.\n11. Return the output grid.\n\nThis revised strategy correctly identifies templates and uses the bounding box of all non-template, non-gray, non-background pixels to define the key grid, reading colors directly from the original input grid based on relative position.Okay, let's break down the analysis and refine the approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code successfully solved Example 2 but failed on Example 1. The failure report showed that the transformed output for Example 1 was identical to the input, meaning the transformation logic was not applied.\n\n*   **Initial Hypothesis & Correction:** My initial thought was that the failure was solely due to Example 1 having a non-contiguous \"key\" pattern, which the `find_contiguous_objects` logic wouldn't select. However, the metrics calculated using the provided `find_template_objects` function revealed a deeper issue: **zero templates were detected in Example 1**.\n*   **Root Cause:** Analysis of the `find_template_objects` function showed a flaw: it incorrectly disqualified a potential template object if any of its constituent gray pixels were adjacent to a non-gray, non-background pixel (colors 1-4, 6-9). This occurred in Example 1 where the key pixels are adjacent to some template pixels. This check needs to be removed; adjacency should not invalidate a template composed purely of gray pixels in the correct hollow 3x3 shape.\n*   **Revised Strategy:**\n    1.  Correct the `find_template_objects` function to reliably identify all 3x3 hollow gray squares, regardless of adjacent pixels.\n    2.  Implement the transformation logic based on the *bounding box* of *all* relevant \"key source\" pixels (non-template, non-gray, non-background), rather than requiring a single contiguous key object.\n    3.  Ensure the dimensions of the template grid arrangement match the dimensions of the key source pixels' bounding box.\n    4.  Map colors from the original input grid locations corresponding to the key source bounding box onto the template pixels.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nBased on the re-evaluation (assuming a corrected `find_template_objects`):\n\n*   **Example 1 (Failure Case):**\n    *   Input Grid Size: 23x23\n    *   Templates Found (Expected): 16 (arranged in a 4x4 grid)\n    *   Template Grid Dimensions (`tr`, `tc`): (4, 4)\n    *   Key Source Pixels (Colors 1, 8, 4 outside templates): 16 pixels\n    *   Key Source Bounding Box Top-Left: (3, 1)\n    *   Key Source Bounding Box Dimensions: (4, 4) (rows 3-6, cols 1-4)\n    *   Dimensions Match (`tr`==`key_h`, `tc`==`key_w`): True\n    *   Failure Reason (Original Code): Incorrect `find_template_objects` (found 0 templates). Even if templates were found, the old key finding logic (`find_contiguous_objects` searching for a single `tr`x`tc` object) would have failed because the key pixels are not contiguous.\n    *   Expected Output vs. Input: Gray template pixels are replaced by colors from the 4x4 key region.\n\n*   **Example 2 (Success Case):**\n    *   Input Grid Size: 23x23\n    *   Templates Found: 15 (arranged in a 3x5 grid)\n    *   Template Grid Dimensions (`tr`, `tc`): (3, 5)\n    *   Key Source Pixels (Colors 1, 2, 3 outside templates): 15 pixels\n    *   Key Source Bounding Box Top-Left: (19, 1)\n    *   Key Source Bounding Box Dimensions: (3, 5) (rows 19-21, cols 1-5)\n    *   Dimensions Match (`tr`==`key_h`, `tc`==`key_w`): True\n    *   Success Reason (Original Code): `find_template_objects` worked (templates weren't adjacent to problematic colors), *and* the key source pixels formed a single contiguous object matching the required dimensions.\n    *   Expected Output vs. Input: Gray template pixels are replaced by colors from the 3x5 key region.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet**\n\n"
