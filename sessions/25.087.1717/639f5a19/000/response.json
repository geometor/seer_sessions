The output grids retain the white background but replace the azure blocks with patterns composed of five colors: magenta (6), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4). The pattern within each replaced block seems determined by the pixel's position relative to the block's boundaries and center. Specifically, there appears to be a border region (2 pixels thick) and a central region. The border color depends on which side (top, bottom, left, right) it belongs to and whether it's in the first or second half (vertically or horizontally) of that side. The central area is filled with yellow. The transformation is applied independently to each azure block found in the input.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Identify all distinct, contiguous rectangular blocks composed solely of azure pixels (8).\n    3.  For each identified azure block:\n        a.  Determine its bounding box: top row (`r0`), leftmost column (`c0`), height (`H`), and width (`W`).\n        b.  Calculate the horizontal midpoint index: `mid_h = H // 2`.\n        c.  Calculate the vertical midpoint index: `mid_w = W // 2`.\n        d.  Define the border thickness: `T = 2`.\n        e.  Iterate through each pixel within the block's bounding box, using global coordinates (`row`, `col`) where `r0 <= row < r0 + H` and `c0 <= col < c0 + W`.\n        f.  Calculate the local coordinates relative to the block's top-left corner: `r = row - r0`, `c = col - c0`.\n        g.  Determine the output color for the pixel at (`row`, `col`) based on its local coordinates (`r`, `c`):\n            i.  If `r < T` (pixel is in the top border rows): Set the output pixel color to magenta (6) if `c < mid_w`, otherwise set it to blue (1).\n            ii. Else if `r >= H - T` (pixel is in the bottom border rows): Set the output pixel color to red (2) if `c < mid_w`, otherwise set it to green (3).\n            iii. Else if `c < T` (pixel is in the left border columns, excluding already handled top/bottom border rows): Set the output pixel color to magenta (6) if `r < mid_h`, otherwise set it to red (2).\n            iv. Else if `c >= W - T` (pixel is in the right border columns, excluding already handled top/bottom border rows): Set the output pixel color to blue (1) if `r < mid_h`, otherwise set it to green (3).\n            v.
