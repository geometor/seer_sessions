The output grid retains the original input grid's content but adds new horizontal patterns below the original orange row. These new patterns are copies of the orange pattern from the input row, placed two rows below the previous pattern (original or copy). The colors of these copies alternate: the first copy below the original orange row uses magenta (6) instead of orange (7), the next copy uses orange (7), the next magenta (6), and so on. The number of copies generated seems to depend on the row index of the original orange pattern in the input.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
