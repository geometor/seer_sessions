        *   The geometric center is roughly (9.35, 9.3). Let's check the pixel at (9, 9). It's white (0). Let's check (9, 10) -> 7 (Orange).
        *   Maybe the center pixel of the output is the color of the pixel at or nearest to the geometric center of the input's non-white pixels. In this case, (9, 9) is white, the nearest non-white are (8, 8)=3, (8, 9)=3, (9, 7)=1, (9, 10)=7, (10, 6)=5, (10, 7)=1, (10, 10)=7. There are multiple closest points. How to choose?
        *   Let's check train_2.
            *   Input: 12x12. Colors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8.
            *   Output: 9x9. Colors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8. Structure: Nested frames. Center=3, Layer1=2, Layer2=4, Layer3=1, Layer4=8.
            *   Geometric center of input non-white pixels?

        *   The geometric center is (6.15, 4.61). The pixel at (6, 4) is Red (2). The pixel at (6, 5) is Yellow (4). The center of the output is Green (3). This approach doesn't work.
        *   Let's reconsider the structure: Nested frames. The colors seem ordered.
        *   Train_1: Center=7(Orange), L1=1(Blue), L2=3(Green), L3=2(Red), L4=5(Gray). Order: 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5.
        *   Train_2: Center=3(Green), L1=2(Red), L2=4(Yellow), L3=1(Blue), L4=8(Azure). Order: 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 8.
        *   Train_3:
            *   Input: 25x25. Colors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9.
            *   Output: 11x11. Colors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9. Structure: Nested frames. Center=5(Gray), L1=7(Orange), L2=9(Maroon), L3=3(Green), L4=4(Yellow), L5=2(Red). Order: 5 -> 7 -> 9 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2.
        *   Is there a property of the input objects that determines this order?
            *   Size? Let's count pixels of each color in the input.
            *   Train_1:
                *   1 (Blue): 18
                *   2 (Red): 21
                *   3 (Green): 18
                *   5 (Gray): 16
                *   7 (Orange): 32
                *   Order: 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5. Sizes: 32 -> 18 -> 18 -> 21 -> 16. Not size order.
            *   Train_2:
                *   1 (Blue): 17
                *   2 (Red): 10
                *   3 (Green): 10
                *   4 (Yellow): 11
                *   8 (Azure): 19
                *   Order: 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 8. Sizes: 10 -> 10 -> 11 -> 17 -> 19. Mostly size order, but 3 and 2 are tied and 3 is center.
            *   Train_3:
                *   2 (Red): 19
                *   3 (Green): 11
                *   4 (Yellow): 25
                *   5 (Gray): 35
                *   7 (Orange): 16
                *   9 (Maroon): 20
                *   Order: 5 -> 7 -> 9 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2. Sizes: 35 -> 16 -> 20 -> 11 -> 25 -> 19. No obvious correlation with size.
        *   What about the position? Average position (centroid) of each color object?
            *   Train_1: Colors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7. Order: 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5.
            *   Train_2: Colors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8. Order: 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 8.
            *   Train_3: Colors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9. Order: 5 -> 7 -> 9 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2.
        *   Maybe it relates to the **innermost** color found when "zooming out" from a central point? Which point?
        *   Let's reconsider the geometric center.
            *   Train_1: Center (9.35, 9.3). Nearest colors: Green(3), Blue(1), Orange(7), Gray(5).
            *   Train_2: Center (6.15, 4.61). Nearest colors: Red(2), Yellow(4).
            *   Train_3: Geometric center?

        *   Geometric center is (13.4, 9.4). This point (13, 9) is white (0). Nearest non-white: (12, 9)=0, (13, 8)=0, (13, 10)=0, (14, 9)=9. Also (12,8)=0, (12,10)=0, (14,8)=9, (14,10)=9. Nearest is Maroon (9) at (14, 9), (14, 8), (14, 10).
        *   The center of the output is Gray (5). This geometric center approach doesn't seem to work for identifying the central color.

        *   Let's rethink the core idea. We create a nested structure of colors. The order of colors and the size of the output grid must be determined from the input.
        *   Output sizes: 9x9, 9x9, 11x11.
        *   Number of unique non-white colors in input: 5, 5, 6.
        *   Output dimension seems related to the number of unique colors `N`. Output size is `(2*N - 1) x (2*N - 1)`.
            *   Train_1: N=5. Size = 2*5 - 1 = 9. Matches 9x9.
            *   Train_2: N=5. Size = 2*5 - 1 = 9. Matches 9x9.
            *   Train_3: N=6. Size = 2*6 - 1 = 11. Matches 11x11.
        *   This looks promising! The output grid size is determined by the number of unique non-white colors in the input.

        *   Now, how is the *order* of colors determined for the nested frames?
            *   Train_1: Order: 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5. Colors: {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
            *   Train_2: Order: 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 8. Colors: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
            *   Train_3: Order: 5 -> 7 -> 9 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2. Colors: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
        *   Is it related to the *minimum* row index where the color first appears?
            *   Train_1: 1(row 3), 2(row 6), 3(row 4), 5(row 6), 7(row 9). Order by min row: 1 -> 3 -> 2/5 -> 7. Doesn't match.
        *   Is it related to the *minimum* column index?
            *   Train_1: 1(col 7), 2(col 0), 3(col 4), 5(col 8), 7(col 10). Order by min col: 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7. Doesn't match.
        *   Is it related to the *total count*? (Checked earlier, no).
        *   Is it related to the color *value* itself?
            *   Train_1: Values: {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}. Order: 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5. No obvious relation.
            *   Train_2: Values: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}. Order: 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 8. No obvious relation.
            *   Train_3: Values: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}. Order: 5 -> 7 -> 9 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2. No obvious relation.

        *   What if the order is determined by examining the input grid in a specific way, perhaps spiraling inwards or outwards from the center?
        *   Let's assume the geometric center again.
            *   Train_1: (9.35, 9.3). Start spiral search outwards. Colors encountered: 1, 3, 7, 5, 2 (roughly). Order: 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 5 -> 2? Doesn't match 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5.
            *   Train_2: (6.15, 4.61). Start spiral search outwards. Colors encountered: 2, 4, 3, 1, 8 (roughly). Order: 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 8? Doesn't match 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 8.
            *   Train_3: (13.4, 9.4). Start spiral search outwards. Colors encountered: 9, 7, 5, 3, 4, 2 (roughly). Order: 9 -> 7 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2? Doesn't match 5 -> 7 -> 9 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2.

        *   Let's reconsider the relationship between colors. In the input, some colored objects touch or overlap.
        *   Maybe the order is determined by which color is "most central" or "most surrounded"?
        *   In Train_1, the Orange (7) object is quite large but somewhat to the bottom right. The Blue (1) line is central vertically. Green (3) is top-leftish. Red (2) is left. Gray (5) is scattered but has parts near the center.
        *   In Train_2, Green (3) is top-left. Red (2) is near center-left. Yellow (4) is center-right. Blue (1) is left border and near center-right. Azure (8) is bottom border and center-bottom.
        *   In Train_3, Gray (5) is quite central. Orange (7) is bottom right. Maroon (9) is bottom center. Green (3) is bottom left. Yellow (4) is top-ish and center-right. Red (2) is top-left and scattered.

        *   This feels like we need to find a "center" color, and then order the remaining colors based on some property relative to that center color or relative to the overall structure.
        *   What if the center color is the one whose bounding box center is closest to the overall geometric center of all non-white pixels?
            *   Train_1: Overall center (9.35, 9.3).
                *   BBox Centers (approx): Red(2)@(7.5, 3), Green(3)@(6, 7), Blue(1)@(8, 7), Gray(5)@(?,?), Orange(7)@(13.5, 13.5).
                *   Distances to (9.35, 9.3): Red(6.7), Green(4.1), Blue(2.5), Orange(5.3). Blue (1) is closest. Output center is Orange (7). Doesn't work.
            *   Train_2: Overall center (6.15, 4.61).
                *   BBox Centers (approx): Green(3)@(2, 3), Red(2)@(5.5, 5.5), Yellow(4)@(7.5, 7), Blue(1)@(?,?), Azure(8)@(9.5, 5.5).
                *   Distances to (6.15, 4.61): Green(4.4), Red(1.0), Yellow(2.8), Azure(3.5). Red (2) is closest. Output center is Green (3). Doesn't work.
            *   Train_3: Overall center (13.4, 9.4).
                *   BBox Centers (approx): Red(2)@(?,?), Green(3)@(19, 4), Yellow(4)@(?,?), Gray(5)@(13.5, 10), Orange(7)@(18.5, 16), Maroon(9)@(17.5, 10).
                *   Distances to (13.4, 9.4): Green(7.8), Gray(0.7), Orange(7.9), Maroon(4.2). Gray (5) is closest. Output center is Gray (5). This one works!

        *   Let's re-evaluate Train_1 and Train_2 BBoxes and centers more carefully.
        *   Train_1: Colors {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}. Overall center (9.35, 9.3). Output center: 7.
            *   Let's find the centroid of each color object.
