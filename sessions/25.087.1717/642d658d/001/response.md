"""
Identify specific 3-pixel patterns centered around a yellow (4) pixel in the input grid. 
The patterns are either horizontal (C-4-C) or vertical (C above 4, 4 above C), 
where C is a color other than white (0) or yellow (4). Count the occurrences of each 
flanking color C across all identified patterns. Determine the color(s) C that appear 
most frequently. If there is a tie for the most frequent color, select the color with 
the smallest numerical value among the tied colors. The final output is this single 
numerical color value.
