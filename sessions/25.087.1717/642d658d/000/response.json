Scattered within the grid are specific 3-pixel patterns. These patterns consist of a central yellow pixel (4) flanked horizontally or vertically by two identical pixels of another color (C). The task is to identify these `C-4-C` (horizontal) or `C / 4 / C` (vertical) patterns, count the frequency of each color `C` involved, and determine the output color based on these frequencies. The output is not a grid but a single number representing a color.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
