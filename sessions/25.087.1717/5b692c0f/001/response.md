"""
Fill internal white (0) pixels in colored shapes based on neighbor counts.

A white pixel changes color if it has 4 or more neighbors (including diagonals) 
of a single non-white, non-yellow (4) color. The white pixel adopts the color 
of the neighbors that met the count threshold. Yellow pixels and other existing 
non-white pixels remain unchanged.
