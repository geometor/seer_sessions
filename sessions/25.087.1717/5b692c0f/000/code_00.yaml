task_description: Fill internal holes in colored shapes based on neighbor counts.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9).
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    role: The default empty space. Remains unchanged.
  - element: shape_pixels
    color: Variable (e.g., green(3), blue(1), red(2))
    role: Form the main structure of objects. Remain unchanged.
  - element: marker_pixels
    color: yellow (4)
    role: Appear within shapes, seem inert in the transformation (neither change nor cause change). Remain unchanged.
  - element: hole_pixels
    color: white (0)
    role: Located within or adjacent to shapes. These are the candidates for transformation.

transformation:
  action: Conditional Color Change (Filling)
  target: white (0) pixels
  condition: A white pixel changes color if it has 4 or more neighbors (including diagonals) of a single non-white, non-yellow color.
  result: The white pixel adopts the color of the neighbors that met the count threshold.
  constraints:
    - Only white pixels can change.
    - Yellow (4) pixels do not change and do not count as neighbors for the filling condition.
    - Other colored pixels (e.g., green, blue, red) do not change.
    - The process considers each white pixel independently based on its neighbors in the *input* grid.

relationships:
  - relationship: Adjacency
    description: The 8 neighboring pixels (including diagonals) are checked for each white pixel.
  - relationship: Thresholding
    description: A count threshold (>= 4) determines if a white pixel changes color.
  - relationship: Color Dominance
    description: The filling color is determined by the single non-white, non-yellow color that meets the neighbor threshold. (Implicitly assumes no ambiguity where multiple colors meet the threshold for the same white pixel in these examples).
