Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels represented by numbers 0-9 (colors). The grid size varies between examples.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0, background), green (3) and yellow (4) in the first example, and white (0), blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4) in the second example.
3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct shapes or patterns on the white background. These shapes contain internal "holes" represented by white pixels. Yellow pixels appear embedded within the main colored shapes (green, blue, red).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a "filling" process. Some white pixels within or near the colored shapes in the input are changed to a non-white color in the output. The original non-white pixels (green, blue, red, yellow) seem to remain in their positions.
5.  **Rule Discovery:** By comparing input and output grids, specifically focusing on the white pixels that change color, a pattern emerges. A white pixel changes color if it is sufficiently "surrounded" by pixels of a *single* specific color (excluding yellow). In both examples, the threshold seems to be having 4 or more neighbors (including diagonals) of that specific color. Yellow pixels act neither as a fill color nor do they seem to contribute to the neighbor count for filling. The color used for filling is the one that meets the neighbor count threshold (green in example 1, blue or red in example 2).

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill internal holes in colored shapes based on neighbor counts.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9).
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    role: The default empty space. Remains unchanged.
  - element: shape_pixels
    color: Variable (e.g., green(3), blue(1), red(2))
    role: Form the main structure of objects. Remain unchanged.
  - element: marker_pixels
    color: yellow (4)
    role: Appear within shapes, seem inert in the transformation (neither change nor cause change). Remain unchanged.
  - element: hole_pixels
    color: white (0)
    role: Located within or adjacent to shapes. These are the candidates for transformation.

transformation:
  action: Conditional Color Change (Filling)
  target: white (0) pixels
  condition: A white pixel changes color if it has 4 or more neighbors (including diagonals) of a single non-white, non-yellow color.
  result: The white pixel adopts the color of the neighbors that met the count threshold.
  constraints:
    - Only white pixels can change.
    - Yellow (4) pixels do not change and do not count as neighbors for the filling condition.
    - Other colored pixels (e.g., green, blue, red) do not change.
    - The process considers each white pixel independently based on its neighbors in the *input* grid.

relationships:
  - relationship: Adjacency
    description: The 8 neighboring pixels (including diagonals) are checked for each white pixel.
  - relationship: Thresholding
    description: A count threshold (>= 4) determines if a white pixel changes color.
  - relationship: Color Dominance
    description: The filling color is determined by the single non-white, non-yellow color that meets the neighbor threshold. (Implicitly assumes no ambiguity where multiple colors meet the threshold for the same white pixel in these examples).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid using its row and column index.
3.  If the current pixel in the input grid is white (0):
    a.  Initialize counts for each potential fill color (e.g., blue, red, green, etc., excluding white and yellow) found among the neighbors to zero.
    b.  Examine the 8 neighboring pixels (including diagonals) around the current white pixel in the input grid. Be careful to handle boundary conditions (pixels at the edge of the grid have fewer neighbors).
    c.  For each neighbor:
        i.  If the neighbor is not white (0) and not yellow (4), increment the count for that neighbor's color.
    d.  After checking all neighbors, determine if any single color count is 4 or greater.
    e.  If a color count meets or exceeds the threshold of 4, change the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to that color. (Based on the examples, it appears only one color will meet this threshold for any given white pixel).
4.  If the current pixel in the input grid is not white (0), its value is already copied to the output grid and remains unchanged.
5.  After iterating through all pixels, return the modified output grid.
