            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels represented by numbers 0-9 (colors). The grid size varies between examples.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0, background), green (3) and yellow (4) in the first example, and white (0), blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4) in the second example.\n3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct shapes or patterns on the white background. These shapes contain internal \"holes\" represented by white pixels. Yellow pixels appear embedded within the main colored shapes (green, blue, red).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a \"filling\" process. Some white pixels within or near the colored shapes in the input are changed to a non-white color in the output. The original non-white pixels (green, blue, red, yellow) seem to remain in their positions.\n5.  **Rule Discovery:** By comparing input and output grids, specifically focusing on the white pixels that change color, a pattern emerges. A white pixel changes color if it is sufficiently \"surrounded\" by pixels of a *single* specific color (excluding yellow). In both examples, the threshold seems to be having 4 or more neighbors (including diagonals) of that specific color. Yellow pixels act neither as a fill color nor do they seem to contribute to the neighbor count for filling. The color used for filling is the one that meets the neighbor count threshold (green in example 1, blue or red in example 2).\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
