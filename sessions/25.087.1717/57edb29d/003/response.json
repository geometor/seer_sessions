Identify the border color (Yellow/4) and the background color (White/0).\n2. Find all connected components (objects) within the input grid that consist of colors other than the border color.\n3. Determine which of these objects are fully enclosed by the border color. An object is enclosed if none of its pixels touch the grid boundary, and all pixels immediately adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the object's pixels are either part of the object itself or are the border color.\n4. Collect the color, coordinates, and bounding box (min/max row/col) of each enclosed object.\n5. Examine the colors of all the identified enclosed objects.\n6. Selection Rule:\n    a. If the color Blue (1) is *not* present among the colors of the enclosed objects, select the enclosed object whose color is Azure (8).\n    b. If the color Blue (1) *is* present among the colors of the enclosed objects, select the object whose bounding box top-left corner (min_row, min_col) has the minimum row index, and then the minimum column index in case of a tie in row index.\n7. Take the selected object's color and coordinates.\n8. Create the output grid: its dimensions should match the dimensions of the selected object's bounding box. Initialize this grid with the background color (White/0).\n9. Map the pixels from the selected object's coordinates onto the output grid, preserving their color and relative positions within the bounding box. The pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid (which belongs to the selected object) should be placed at `(r - min_row, c - min_col)` in the output grid, where `min_row` and `min_col` are from the object's bounding box.\n\"\"\"\n\nBORDER_COLOR = 4\nBACKGROUND_COLOR = 0\nBLUE = 1\nAZURE = 8\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all connected components (objects) of non-border colors.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, each representing an object with keys:\n              'color': The color of the object.\n              'coords': A set of (row, col) tuples for the object's pixels.\n              'bbox': A tuple (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c) for the bounding box.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            #
