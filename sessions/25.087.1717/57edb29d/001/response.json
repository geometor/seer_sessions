Identify the border color, which is consistently yellow (4) in the examples.\n2. Find all connected components (objects) consisting of non-border colors within the input grid.\n3. For each component found, determine if it is fully enclosed by the border color. An object is considered enclosed if every neighboring pixel of every pixel in the object is either part of the object itself or is the border color. Objects touching the grid edge are not considered enclosed.\n4. For each enclosed object:\n    a. Determine its bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).\n    b. Identify its 'inner color', defined as the color of the pixel at the top-left corner of its bounding box (input_grid[min_row, min_col]).\n    c. Extract the rectangular subgrid corresponding to the object's content, defined by its bounding box.\n5. Count the occurrences of each 'inner color' among all identified enclosed objects.\n6. Find the 'inner color' that occurs exactly once (the unique inner color).\n7. The output grid is the extracted content (subgrid) of the object associated with this unique inner color.\n8. If no unique inner color is found (e.g., no objects, no enclosed objects, or all enclosed objects have inner colors that appear multiple times), the transformation is undefined based on the examples (an error might be raised, or a default grid returned).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef is_enclosed_by_border(grid, component_coords, border_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a component is fully enclosed by the border color.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n        component_coords (set): A set of (row, col) tuples representing the component.\n        border_color (int): The color value representing the border.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the component is enclosed, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    #
