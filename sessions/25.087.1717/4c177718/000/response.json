It always matches one of the objects in the top half (specifically, the leftmost object in all examples).\n    *   The middle object from the top half of the input grid is always discarded. In the examples, this object is always red (color 2).\n    *   The two objects kept for the output are the leftmost object (the one matching the key) and the rightmost object from the top half.\n    *   The vertical stacking order of the two kept objects in the output depends on the shape of the discarded middle object from the input's top half. If the discarded object is a \"Plus\" shape, the leftmost object is placed on top. If the discarded object is a \"T\" shape, the rightmost object is placed on top.\n    *   The output grid is sized minimally to contain the two stacked objects with one row of white padding above, between, and below them. The objects appear horizontally centered.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "

Divide the input grid into two sections: the area above the gray line (top half) and the area below the gray line (bottom half).\n    3.  Identify the distinct colored objects in the top half.

Identify the single distinct colored object in the bottom half (the \"Key Object\"). Note its shape and color.\n    5.  Verify that the Key Object from the bottom half has the same shape and color as the Leftmost object from the top half. Designate the Leftmost object as the \"Matched Object\".\n    6.
