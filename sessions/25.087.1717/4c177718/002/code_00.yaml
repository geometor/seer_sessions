Input Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Variable, but consistently 15x15 in examples.
    - Content:
      - Background: White (0)
      - Separator: A single horizontal line of Gray (5) pixels dividing the grid.
      - Top Region: Contains 3 distinct colored objects (non-White, non-Gray), horizontally arranged (Left, Middle, Right).
      - Bottom Region: Contains 1 distinct colored object (Key Object).
Objects:
  - Left Object (Top Region):
    - Role: Candidate for matching the Key Object.
    - Properties: Variable shape and color.
  - Middle Object (Top Region):
    - Role: Discarded Object, determines stacking order.
    - Properties: Always Red (2) in examples. Shape is either 'Plus' or 'T'.
  - Right Object (Top Region):
    - Role: Other Object, involved in stacking and determines vertical padding.
    - Properties: Variable shape and color (Green, Yellow, Magenta, Orange in examples).
  - Key Object (Bottom Region):
    - Role: Used to identify the 'Matched Object' in the top region.
    - Properties: Variable shape and color, identical to one of the top objects (always the Left Object in examples).
Transformation:
  Actions:
    - Find Gray line separator.
    - Identify the 4 objects (Key, Left, Middle, Right).
    - Match Key Object with Left Object -> Identify 'Matched Object'.
    - Identify Middle Object -> 'Discarded Object'.
    - Identify Right Object -> 'Other Object'.
    - Determine Shape of Discarded Object ('Plus' or 'T').
    - Determine Stacking Order:
      - If Discarded is 'Plus': Stack Matched on top, Other on bottom.
      - If Discarded is 'T': Stack Other on top, Matched on bottom.
    - Determine Output Grid Dimensions:
      - Width: Same as Input Grid Width.
      - Height: Fixed at 9.
    - Determine Vertical Placement (Padding):
      - Total vertical padding is 3 rows (Output Height 9 - Object Heights 3+3).
      - Top Padding (`P_top`) depends on Discarded Object Shape and Other Object Color:
        - Plus & Orange(7): `P_top = 3`
        - Plus & Magenta(6): `P_top = 1`
        - T & Yellow(4): `P_top = 0`
        - T & Green(3): `P_top = 2`
      - Bottom Padding (`P_bottom`) = 3 - `P_top`.
    - Construct Output Grid:
      - Create a 9xInputWidth grid initialized with White (0).
      - Place the top stacked object, horizontally centered, starting at row `P_top`.
      - Place the bottom stacked object, horizontally centered, starting immediately below the top one (row `P_top` + height of top object).
Output Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Height is 9, Width matches Input Width.
    - Content:
      - Background: White (0).
      - Two objects (Matched and Other) stacked vertically with no space between them.
      - Stacked pair is horizontally centered.
      - Vertical placement varies based on the padding rules derived from Discarded shape and Other color.
