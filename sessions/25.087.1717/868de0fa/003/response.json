A region is considered enclosed if the BFS, starting from a pixel within the region, only encounters blue pixels (1) at its immediate boundary and does not reach the grid edge.\nIf a white region is enclosed:\n  - It checks the neighbors (8-connectivity) of all the blue pixels forming the immediate boundary of the enclosed region.\n  - If any of these boundary blue pixels has a neighbor (that is not part of the enclosed white region itself) with a color other than white (0) or blue (1), the enclosed white region is filled with red (2).\n  - Otherwise (if all neighbors of the boundary blue pixels are either white (0), blue (1), or part of the enclosed white region), the enclosed white region is filled with orange (7).\nPixels that are not part of such an enclosed and filled white region remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fills enclosed white regions within blue loops based on boundary adjacency.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: The transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid_np)\n    height, width = input_grid_np.shape\n    visited_white = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=bool) #
