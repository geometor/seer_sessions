            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation logic.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code successfully identifies contiguous white regions enclosed entirely by blue pixels and correctly avoids filling regions that touch the grid boundary or are not enclosed solely by blue. The core structure involving BFS for region identification seems sound.\n\nHowever, the code consistently fails in determining the correct fill color (Orange vs. Red) for these enclosed regions across multiple examples. It incorrectly filled Orange regions with Red (Example 1) and Red regions with Orange (Examples 2, 3, 4, 5). This points to a specific flaw in the condition used to differentiate between the two fill scenarios, likely related to how the neighbors of the boundary blue pixels are examined.\n\nThe strategy is to re-evaluate the condition that determines whether an enclosed white region is filled with Red (2) or Orange (7), focusing on the relationship between the boundary blue pixels and any adjacent blue pixels *outside* the immediate boundary.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's examine the discrepancies:\n\n*   **Example 1 (Bottom-left region):** Expected Orange (7), Actual Red (2). The code found an 'external' blue neighbor for a boundary blue pixel using 8-way adjacency (specifically, pixel (5,5) is diagonal to boundary pixel (6,4)). The expected Orange suggests this diagonal external neighbor should *not* trigger the Red fill.\n*   **Example 2 (Right region):** Expected Red (2), Actual Orange (7). The code failed to find an 'external' blue neighbor condition. However, boundary pixel (1,4) has orthogonal blue neighbors (0,4) and (0,5) which are not part of the immediate boundary set. The expected Red suggests these *should* trigger the Red fill.\n*   **Example 3 (Middle, Right, Bottom-right regions):** Expected Red (2), Actual Orange (7). Similar to Example 2, the code missed the condition. Orthogonal external blue neighbors exist for boundary pixels in each case (e.g., (1,8) for boundary (2,8); (3,8) for boundary (4,8); (12,8) for boundary (13,8)).\n*   **Example 4 (Bottom region):** Expected Red (2), Actual Orange (7). Again, the code missed the condition. Boundary pixel (10,7) has an orthogonal external blue neighbor (9,7).\n*   **Example 5 (Top-left region):** Expected Red (2), Actual Orange (7). Code missed the condition. Boundary pixel (1,1) has an orthogonal external blue neighbor (0,1).\n\n**Conclusion from Analysis:** The determining factor for the fill color appears to be the presence of an *orthogonally* adjacent blue neighbor to a boundary blue pixel, where this neighbor is *not* part of the immediate boundary set itself. The previous code used 8-way adjacency (including diagonals) for this check, leading to the errors.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
