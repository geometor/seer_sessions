task_description: Fill enclosed white regions within blue loops with either orange or red based on boundary conditions.

input_features:
  - object: Grid containing pixels of different colors (white=0, blue=1, etc.).
  - property: Grids have varying dimensions.
  - object: Contiguous regions of white pixels (color 0).
  - object: Contiguous loops or boundaries of blue pixels (color 1).

transformations:
  - action: identify_regions
    target: white pixels (0)
    condition: contiguous area not touching the grid boundary.
    algorithm: Breadth-First Search (BFS) or similar flood fill.
  - action: check_boundary
    target: identified white regions
    condition: The region must be immediately and completely surrounded only by blue pixels (1). Check all 8 neighbors of region pixels.
    result: region_is_enclosed_by_blue (boolean)
  - action: determine_fill_color
    target: enclosed white regions confirmed in the previous step
    condition_red: At least one blue pixel on the immediate boundary of the white region has an *orthogonally* adjacent blue pixel that is *not* part of the same immediate boundary set.
    condition_orange: No boundary blue pixel satisfies the condition for red.
    output_color_1: red (2)
    output_color_2: orange (7)
  - action: fill_region
    target: enclosed white regions
    color: determined fill color (red or orange)
    result: Updated grid with filled regions.

output_features:
  - object: Grid with the same dimensions as the input.
  - property: Previously enclosed white regions are now filled with either orange (7) or red (2).
  - property: All other pixels remain unchanged.

constants:
  - white: 0
  - blue: 1
  - red: 2
  - orange: 7
