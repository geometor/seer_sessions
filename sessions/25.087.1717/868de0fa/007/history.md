"""
Identifies contiguous regions of white pixels (0) in the input grid.
For each white region, it determines if it is fully enclosed by blue pixels (1) using a Breadth-First Search (BFS). A region is considered enclosed if the BFS, starting from a pixel within the region, only encounters blue pixels (1) at its immediate boundary and does not reach the grid edge.
If a white region is enclosed:
  - It examines the neighbors (8-connectivity) of all the blue pixels forming the immediate boundary of the enclosed region (let's call this set B).
  - If any blue pixel in B has a neighbor that is also blue (1) but is *not* part of the set B itself (i.e., an 'external' blue neighbor), the enclosed white region is filled with red (2).
  - Otherwise (if all neighbors of the boundary blue pixels are either white (0), part of the enclosed white region, part of the boundary set B, or non-blue colors), the enclosed white region is filled with orange (7).
Pixels that are not part of such an enclosed and filled white region remain unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation logic.

**General Assessment**

The provided code successfully identifies contiguous white regions enclosed entirely by blue pixels and correctly avoids filling regions that touch the grid boundary or are not enclosed solely by blue. The core structure involving BFS for region identification seems sound.

However, the code consistently fails in determining the correct fill color (Orange vs. Red) for these enclosed regions across multiple examples. It incorrectly filled Orange regions with Red (Example 1) and Red regions with Orange (Examples 2, 3, 4, 5). This points to a specific flaw in the condition used to differentiate between the two fill scenarios, likely related to how the neighbors of the boundary blue pixels are examined.

The strategy is to re-evaluate the condition that determines whether an enclosed white region is filled with Red (2) or Orange (7), focusing on the relationship between the boundary blue pixels and any adjacent blue pixels *outside* the immediate boundary.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Let's examine the discrepancies:

*   **Example 1 (Bottom-left region):** Expected Orange (7), Actual Red (2). The code found an 'external' blue neighbor for a boundary blue pixel using 8-way adjacency (specifically, pixel (5,5) is diagonal to boundary pixel (6,4)). The expected Orange suggests this diagonal external neighbor should *not* trigger the Red fill.
*   **Example 2 (Right region):** Expected Red (2), Actual Orange (7). The code failed to find an 'external' blue neighbor condition. However, boundary pixel (1,4) has orthogonal blue neighbors (0,4) and (0,5) which are not part of the immediate boundary set. The expected Red suggests these *should* trigger the Red fill.
*   **Example 3 (Middle, Right, Bottom-right regions):** Expected Red (2), Actual Orange (7). Similar to Example 2, the code missed the condition. Orthogonal external blue neighbors exist for boundary pixels in each case (e.g., (1,8) for boundary (2,8); (3,8) for boundary (4,8); (12,8) for boundary (13,8)).
*   **Example 4 (Bottom region):** Expected Red (2), Actual Orange (7). Again, the code missed the condition. Boundary pixel (10,7) has an orthogonal external blue neighbor (9,7).
*   **Example 5 (Top-left region):** Expected Red (2), Actual Orange (7). Code missed the condition. Boundary pixel (1,1) has an orthogonal external blue neighbor (0,1).

**Conclusion from Analysis:** The determining factor for the fill color appears to be the presence of an *orthogonally* adjacent blue neighbor to a boundary blue pixel, where this neighbor is *not* part of the immediate boundary set itself. The previous code used 8-way adjacency (including diagonals) for this check, leading to the errors.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Fill enclosed white regions within blue loops with either orange or red based on boundary conditions.

input_features:
  - object: Grid containing pixels of different colors (white=0, blue=1, etc.).
  - property: Grids have varying dimensions.
  - object: Contiguous regions of white pixels (color 0).
  - object: Contiguous loops or boundaries of blue pixels (color 1).

transformations:
  - action: identify_regions
    target: white pixels (0)
    condition: contiguous area not touching the grid boundary.
    algorithm: Breadth-First Search (BFS) or similar flood fill.
  - action: check_boundary
    target: identified white regions
    condition: The region must be immediately and completely surrounded only by blue pixels (1). Check all 8 neighbors of region pixels.
    result: region_is_enclosed_by_blue (boolean)
  - action: determine_fill_color
    target: enclosed white regions confirmed in the previous step
    condition_red: At least one blue pixel on the immediate boundary of the white region has an *orthogonally* adjacent blue pixel that is *not* part of the same immediate boundary set.
    condition_orange: No boundary blue pixel satisfies the condition for red.
    output_color_1: red (2)
    output_color_2: orange (7)
  - action: fill_region
    target: enclosed white regions
    color: determined fill color (red or orange)
    result: Updated grid with filled regions.

output_features:
  - object: Grid with the same dimensions as the input.
  - property: Previously enclosed white regions are now filled with either orange (7) or red (2).
  - property: All other pixels remain unchanged.

constants:
  - white: 0
  - blue: 1
  - red: 2
  - orange: 7
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Keep track of white pixels that have already been visited as part of a region search.
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
4.  If a pixel is white (0) and has not been visited yet:
    a.  Start a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from this pixel to find the extent of the contiguous white region it belongs to.
    b.  During the BFS, mark all encountered white pixels within the region as visited.
    c.  Keep track of all pixels belonging to this white region.
    d.  Keep track of all unique blue (1) pixels that are adjacent (using 8-way connectivity: includes diagonals) to any pixel in the white region. These form the "immediate boundary set".
    e.  Track if the BFS encounters the grid edge (meaning the white region touches the boundary) or encounters any non-white, non-blue pixel at its immediate border.
    f.  If the BFS completes *without* hitting the grid edge AND *only* encountered blue pixels at its immediate border (meaning it's fully enclosed by blue):
        i.   Assume the fill color will be Orange (7).
        ii.  Iterate through each blue pixel (`B`) in the "immediate boundary set".
        iii. For each boundary blue pixel `B`, check its *orthogonal* neighbors (up, down, left, right).
        iv.  If any orthogonal neighbor is also blue (1) AND this neighboring blue pixel is *not* part of the "immediate boundary set" identified in step 4d:
            1.  Change the fill color to Red (2).
            2.  Stop checking neighbors for this region (the condition for Red is met).
        v.   After checking all boundary blue pixels (or stopping early if Red was chosen), fill all pixels belonging to the current white region (identified in step 4c) with the determined fill color (Red or Orange) in the output grid.
5.  Once all pixels in the input grid have been processed, return the modified output grid.
