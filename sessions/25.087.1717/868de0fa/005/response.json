A region is considered enclosed if the BFS, starting from a pixel within the region, only encounters blue pixels (1) at its immediate boundary and does not reach the grid edge.\nIf a white region is enclosed:\n  - It examines the neighbors (8-connectivity) of all the blue pixels forming the immediate boundary of the enclosed region (let's call this set B).\n  - If any blue pixel in B has a neighbor that is also blue (1) but is *not* part of the set B itself (i.e., an 'external' blue neighbor), the enclosed white region is filled with red (2).\n  - Otherwise (if all neighbors of the boundary blue pixels are either white (0), part of the enclosed white region, part of the boundary set B, or non-blue colors), the enclosed white region is filled with orange (7).\nPixels that are not part of such an enclosed and filled white region remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fills enclosed white regions within blue loops based on the adjacency \n    of boundary blue pixels to other 'external' blue pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: The transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid_np)\n    height, width = input_grid_np.shape\n    visited_white = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=bool) #
