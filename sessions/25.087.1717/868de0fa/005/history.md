"""
Identifies contiguous regions of white pixels (0) in the input grid.
For each white region, it determines if it is fully enclosed by blue pixels (1) using a Breadth-First Search (BFS). A region is considered enclosed if the BFS, starting from a pixel within the region, only encounters blue pixels (1) at its immediate boundary and does not reach the grid edge.
If a white region is enclosed:
  - It checks the neighbors (8-connectivity) of all the blue pixels forming the immediate boundary of the enclosed region.
  - If any of these boundary blue pixels has a neighbor (that is not part of the enclosed white region itself) with a color other than white (0) or blue (1), the enclosed white region is filled with red (2).
  - Otherwise (if all neighbors of the boundary blue pixels are either white (0), blue (1), or part of the enclosed white region), the enclosed white region is filled with orange (7).
Pixels that are not part of such an enclosed and filled white region remain unchanged.

## General Assessment

The provided code correctly identifies contiguous white regions enclosed by blue pixels. It uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find these regions and their immediate blue boundaries. However, the logic for deciding the fill color (red vs. orange) is flawed, leading to incorrect outputs in all examples where a red fill is expected.

The code currently fills with red (2) if any boundary blue pixel has a neighbor (not part of the enclosed white region) with a color other than white (0) or blue (1). Otherwise, it fills with orange (7).

The analysis of the examples suggests a different rule: The fill color depends on whether the blue pixels forming the *immediate* boundary of the white region are adjacent to *other* blue pixels that are *not* part of that same immediate boundary. If such an "external" adjacent blue pixel exists, the fill color is red (2); otherwise, it is orange (7).

The strategy is to refine the condition for choosing the fill color based on this revised understanding of the boundary interactions.

## Metrics and Observations

*   **Commonality:** In all examples, the task involves identifying white (0) areas completely enclosed by blue (1) pixels without touching the grid edges.
*   **Transformation:** These enclosed white areas are filled with either orange (7) or red (2). All other pixels remain unchanged.
*   **Error Pattern:** The code consistently fails to produce the red (2) fill color, instead defaulting to orange (7) in those cases. This occurs in Examples 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The orange (7) fill is produced correctly when expected.
*   **Enclosed Regions:** White areas touching the grid border or not fully enclosed by blue are never filled.
*   **Fill Color Condition:**
    *   **Orange (7):** The expected output shows orange fill when the blue pixels forming the immediate boundary of the white region are only adjacent (8-connectivity) to white pixels (0), the enclosed white region's pixels, or *other blue pixels belonging to the same immediate boundary*.
    *   **Red (2):** The expected output shows red fill when at least one of the blue pixels forming the immediate boundary of the white region is adjacent (8-connectivity) to *another blue pixel (1) that is NOT part of that same immediate boundary set*.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid to find potential white (0) regions that haven't been processed yet.
3.  For each unprocessed white pixel found, perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from that pixel:
    a.  Identify all connected white pixels belonging to the same region. Keep track of these `region_pixels`. Mark them as processed to avoid redundant checks.
    b.  During the BFS, identify all blue (1) pixels that are immediate neighbors (8-connectivity) of the `region_pixels`. Store these as the `boundary_blue_pixels` set.
    c.  Keep track if the BFS encounters any pixel that is neither white (0) nor blue (1) neighboring the region, or if the region touches the grid boundary. If either occurs, this region is not a candidate for filling; stop processing this region and continue searching for other white regions.
4.  If the BFS completes and the region was found to be entirely bordered only by blue (1) pixels and did not touch the grid boundary:
    a.  Initialize the `fill_color` to orange (7).
    b.  Set a flag `found_external_blue_neighbor` to false.
    c.  Iterate through each `blue_pixel` in the `boundary_blue_pixels` set.
    d.  For each `blue_pixel`, examine its 8 neighbors (`neighbor_coord`).
    e.  Check if the `neighbor_coord` is within the grid bounds.
    f.  Check if the pixel at `neighbor_coord` in the input grid has the color blue (1).
    g.  If the neighbor is blue (1) AND its coordinate `neighbor_coord` is *not* present in the `boundary_blue_pixels` set:
        i.  Set the `fill_color` to red (2).
        ii. Set `found_external_blue_neighbor` to true.
        iii. Break the inner loops (checking neighbors for the current `blue_pixel` and checking subsequent `blue_pixels` in the boundary set), as the condition for red fill is met.
    h.  If `found_external_blue_neighbor` becomes true, break the outer loop iterating through `boundary_blue_pixels`.
    i.  After checking all boundary blue pixels (or breaking early), fill the identified `region_pixels` in the output grid with the determined `fill_color` (which will be either orange (7) or red (2)).
5.  After iterating through all starting pixels in the grid, return the modified output grid.
