task_type: conditional_filling
components:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - cells: pixels with colors (0-9)
  - object: white_region
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - contiguity: connected pixels (8-connectivity)
      - state: potentially enclosed
  - object: blue_loop
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape: forms a closed loop around a white region
      - role: boundary
    relationships:
      - relation: encloses
        target: white_region
      - relation: adjacency
        target: other_blue_pixels (pixels with color blue(1) not part of this specific loop boundary)
  - object: filled_region
    properties:
      - color: orange (7) or red (2)
      - location: replaces an enclosed white_region
actions:
  - name: find_enclosed_regions
    inputs: grid
    outputs: list of enclosed white_regions and their corresponding blue_loop boundaries
    condition: white_region is contiguous, color is white(0), does not touch grid edge, and all immediate neighbors outside the region are blue(1).
  - name: determine_fill_color
    inputs: blue_loop boundary pixels (set B), grid
    outputs: fill_color (red or orange)
    condition:
      - check_neighbors: For each pixel p in B, examine its 8 neighbors n.
      - check_external_blue: If any neighbor n has color blue(1) AND n is NOT in B:
          - result: fill_color is red(2)
      - default: If the above condition is never met for any p in B:
          - result: fill_color is orange(7)
  - name: fill_region
    inputs: grid, enclosed white_region, fill_color
    outputs: modified_grid
    action: Change the color of all pixels in the enclosed white_region to fill_color.
