They contain multiple scattered pixels or small objects of various colors (red in example 1; blue and gray in example 2). Crucially, each input grid also contains one larger, more complex object of a single color (yellow in example 1, green in example 2).\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are much smaller than the inputs. They precisely match the shape and color of the single larger, complex object identified in the corresponding input grid. The output grid's dimensions are the minimal bounding box required to contain this object. Pixels within the bounding box that were not part of the object in the input are represented by the background color (white, 0) in the output.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying the largest contiguous non-background object in the input grid, determining its minimal bounding box, and extracting that region (including the object and any background pixels within the box) as the output grid. The scattered smaller objects and pixels are ignored.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Let's call this the 'target object'.\n  - L1_Object_Properties:\n      - Target Object Color (Example 1): yellow (4)\n      - Target Object Color (Example 2): green (3)\n      - Target Object Size (Example 1): 6 pixels\n      - Target Object Size (Example 2): 12 pixels\n      - Other Objects: Smaller, scattered, different colors (red in Ex1; blue, gray in Ex2).\n  - L2_Action_Extraction:\n      - The task isolates the target object.\n      - It determines the minimal bounding box containing the target object.\n  - L2_Relationship_Input_Output:\n      - The output grid's content is a cropped section of the input grid defined by the target object's bounding box.\n      - The output grid's dimensions match the dimensions of the target object's bounding box.\n      - All pixels within the bounding box are copied from the input to the output, preserving their original colors (including background pixels if they fall within the box but are not part of the target object itself).\n  - L3_Rule_Inference: The rule is to find the largest contiguous non-background object, extract its bounding box from the input, and present this extracted subgrid as the output.\n```"
