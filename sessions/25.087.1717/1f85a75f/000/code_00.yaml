facts:
  - L0_Observation: The input grid contains pixels of multiple colors against a white background (0).
  - L1_Object_Identification:
      - The input contains several distinct objects (contiguous blocks of the same non-white color).
      - One object is significantly larger (in terms of pixel count) than all other non-white objects. Let's call this the 'target object'.
  - L1_Object_Properties:
      - Target Object Color (Example 1): yellow (4)
      - Target Object Color (Example 2): green (3)
      - Target Object Size (Example 1): 6 pixels
      - Target Object Size (Example 2): 12 pixels
      - Other Objects: Smaller, scattered, different colors (red in Ex1; blue, gray in Ex2).
  - L2_Action_Extraction:
      - The task isolates the target object.
      - It determines the minimal bounding box containing the target object.
  - L2_Relationship_Input_Output:
      - The output grid's content is a cropped section of the input grid defined by the target object's bounding box.
      - The output grid's dimensions match the dimensions of the target object's bounding box.
      - All pixels within the bounding box are copied from the input to the output, preserving their original colors (including background pixels if they fall within the box but are not part of the target object itself).
  - L3_Rule_Inference: The rule is to find the largest contiguous non-background object, extract its bounding box from the input, and present this extracted subgrid as the output.
