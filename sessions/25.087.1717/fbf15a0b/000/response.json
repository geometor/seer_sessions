All examples feature exactly two gray pixels.\n3.  **Gray Pixel Alignment:** The relative positions of the gray pixels determine the cropping logic.\n    *   If the gray pixels are vertically aligned (share the same column index), cropping occurs along the rows (top is removed).\n    *   If the gray pixels are horizontally aligned (share the same row index), cropping occurs along the columns (left is removed).\n4.  **Crop Starting Point:** The starting row or column index for the output subgrid is determined by the absolute difference between the row coordinates (if vertically aligned) or column coordinates (if horizontally aligned) of the gray pixels.\n5.  **Crop Size:** The size of the output grid along the cropped dimension (height if rows were cropped, width if columns were cropped) is exactly half the size of the input grid's corresponding dimension (using integer division). The other dimension remains unchanged.\n6.  **Content Preservation:** The pixel values (colors) within the selected subgrid remain unchanged from the input to the output. The gray pixels themselves are not included in the output unless they happen to fall within the calculated subgrid boundaries (which doesn't occur in the final extracted regions shown in the examples).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
