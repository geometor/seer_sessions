**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Relationship:** The task transforms an input grid into a smaller output grid by cropping.
2.  **Key Element:** Gray pixels (color 5) in the input grid serve as crucial markers or instructions for the transformation. All examples feature exactly two gray pixels.
3.  **Gray Pixel Alignment:** The relative positions of the gray pixels determine the cropping logic.
    *   If the gray pixels are vertically aligned (share the same column index), cropping occurs along the rows (top is removed).
    *   If the gray pixels are horizontally aligned (share the same row index), cropping occurs along the columns (left is removed).
4.  **Crop Starting Point:** The starting row or column index for the output subgrid is determined by the absolute difference between the row coordinates (if vertically aligned) or column coordinates (if horizontally aligned) of the gray pixels.
5.  **Crop Size:** The size of the output grid along the cropped dimension (height if rows were cropped, width if columns were cropped) is exactly half the size of the input grid's corresponding dimension (using integer division). The other dimension remains unchanged.
6.  **Content Preservation:** The pixel values (colors) within the selected subgrid remain unchanged from the input to the output. The gray pixels themselves are not included in the output unless they happen to fall within the calculated subgrid boundaries (which doesn't occur in the final extracted regions shown in the examples).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: cropping
input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9)
  - marker_pixels:
      color: 5 (gray)

      role: define crop parameters
output_features:
  - grid: cropped subgrid of the input
cropping_logic:
  - condition: gray pixels share the same column index `c`
    parameters:
      - row_coords: set of row indices `r` for gray pixels at `(r, c)`
      - start_row: max(row_coords) - min(row_coords)
      - output_height: input_height // 2
      - start_col: 0
      - output_width: input_width
    action: extract subgrid from input using rows `start_row` to `start_row + output_height - 1` and all columns.
  - condition: gray pixels share the same row index `r`
    parameters:
      - col_coords: set of column indices `c` for gray pixels at `(r, c)`
      - start_col: max(col_coords) - min(col_coords)
      - output_width: input_width // 2
      - start_row: 0
      - output_height: input_height
    action: extract subgrid from input using columns `start_col` to `start_col + output_width - 1` and all rows.
assumptions:
  - Integer division is used for halving dimensions.
  - There will always be exactly two gray pixels.
  - The two gray pixels will always be aligned either vertically or horizontally.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the coordinates (row, column) of all gray pixels (color 5) in the input grid. Store these coordinates.
2.  Check if the column coordinates of the gray pixels are the same.
3.  **If the column coordinates are the same:**
    a.  Find the minimum and maximum row coordinates among the gray pixels.
    b.  Calculate the starting row index for the output grid by subtracting the minimum row coordinate from the maximum row coordinate.
    c.  Calculate the required number of rows for the output grid by taking the integer division of the input grid's height by 2.
    d.  Extract the subgrid from the input grid starting at the calculated `start_row`, including the calculated `output_height` number of rows, and keeping all original columns.
4.  **If the column coordinates are not the same (which implies the row coordinates must be the same based on the examples):**
    a.  Find the minimum and maximum column coordinates among the gray pixels.
    b.  Calculate the starting column index for the output grid by subtracting the minimum column coordinate from the maximum column coordinate.
    c.  Calculate the required number of columns for the output grid by taking the integer division of the input grid's width by 2.
    d.  Extract the subgrid from the input grid starting at the calculated `start_col`, including the calculated `output_width` number of columns, and keeping all original rows.
5.  Return the extracted subgrid as the output.
