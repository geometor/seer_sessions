            "text": "Okay, let's refine the understanding of the transformation based on the provided examples and results.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding Python code correctly identified the core concept of using reflections based on the grid's center axes. However, the implementation assumed that a *frame* or *perimeter* should be drawn using the original pixel and its reflections as corners. The comparison between the `Transformed Output` and the `Expected Output` across all examples reveals that this is incorrect. The transformed outputs consistently have far more colored pixels than the expected outputs, forming filled rectangles or thick frames instead of the sparse patterns seen in the solutions.\n\nThe strategy is to re-examine the relationship between each non-white input pixel and its corresponding contribution to the output grid, focusing specifically on the *location* of the output pixels generated by a single input pixel. The expected outputs exhibit clear point symmetry (reflection across both horizontal and vertical centerlines). It appears that instead of drawing a frame, only specific points related to the reflections are being colored.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\nLet's analyze the pattern for a single non-white pixel in Example 1:\n\n*   **Input:** 19x19 grid.\n*   **Pixel:** Green (3) at `(r, c) = (1, 17)`.\n*   **Grid dimensions:** `H=19`, `W=19`.\n*   **Vertical reflection row:** `r_v = H - 1 - r = 19 - 1 - 1 = 17`.\n*   **Horizontal reflection column:** `c_h = W - 1 - c = 19 - 1 - 17 = 1`.\n*   **Four key points:**\n    *   Original: `(r, c) = (1, 17)`\n    *   Vertical Reflection: `(r_v, c) = (17, 17)`\n    *   Horizontal Reflection: `(r, c_h) = (1, 1)`\n    *   Diagonal Reflection: `(r_v, c_h) = (17, 1)`\n*   **Expected Output for this pixel:** Green (3) pixels appear *only* at these four coordinates: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 17)`, `(17, 1)`, and `(17, 17)`.\n*   **Transformed Output for this pixel (Current Code):** Green (3) pixels form a rectangular frame defined by corners `(1, 1)` and `(17, 17)`. This frame includes many pixels not present in the expected output.\n\nThis observation holds true for all other non-white pixels across all three examples. The transformation maps *each* non-white input pixel to *four* specific output pixels corresponding to its original position and its reflections across the grid's center axes.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
