Okay, let's refine the understanding of the transformation based on the provided examples and results.

## General Assessment

The initial natural language program and the corresponding Python code correctly identified the core concept of using reflections based on the grid's center axes. However, the implementation assumed that a *frame* or *perimeter* should be drawn using the original pixel and its reflections as corners. The comparison between the `Transformed Output` and the `Expected Output` across all examples reveals that this is incorrect. The transformed outputs consistently have far more colored pixels than the expected outputs, forming filled rectangles or thick frames instead of the sparse patterns seen in the solutions.

The strategy is to re-examine the relationship between each non-white input pixel and its corresponding contribution to the output grid, focusing specifically on the *location* of the output pixels generated by a single input pixel. The expected outputs exhibit clear point symmetry (reflection across both horizontal and vertical centerlines). It appears that instead of drawing a frame, only specific points related to the reflections are being colored.

## Metrics and Observations

Let's analyze the pattern for a single non-white pixel in Example 1:

*   **Input:** 19x19 grid.
*   **Pixel:** Green (3) at `(r, c) = (1, 17)`.
*   **Grid dimensions:** `H=19`, `W=19`.
*   **Vertical reflection row:** `r_v = H - 1 - r = 19 - 1 - 1 = 17`.
*   **Horizontal reflection column:** `c_h = W - 1 - c = 19 - 1 - 17 = 1`.
*   **Four key points:**
    *   Original: `(r, c) = (1, 17)`
    *   Vertical Reflection: `(r_v, c) = (17, 17)`
    *   Horizontal Reflection: `(r, c_h) = (1, 1)`
    *   Diagonal Reflection: `(r_v, c_h) = (17, 1)`
*   **Expected Output for this pixel:** Green (3) pixels appear *only* at these four coordinates: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 17)`, `(17, 1)`, and `(17, 17)`.
*   **Transformed Output for this pixel (Current Code):** Green (3) pixels form a rectangular frame defined by corners `(1, 1)` and `(17, 17)`. This frame includes many pixels not present in the expected output.

This observation holds true for all other non-white pixels across all three examples. The transformation maps *each* non-white input pixel to *four* specific output pixels corresponding to its original position and its reflections across the grid's center axes.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - dimensions: height (H) and width (W) vary per example, but are consistent between input and output for a given example.
    - symmetry_axes: horizontal centerline (between rows floor((H-1)/2) and ceil((H-1)/2)), vertical centerline (between columns floor((W-1)/2) and ceil((W-1)/2)).
  input_objects:
    - type: individual pixels
    - properties:
        - color: non-white (1-9)
        - position: row (r), column (c)
  output_objects:
    - type: individual pixels derived from input pixels
    - properties:
        - color: same as the generating input pixel
        - position: determined by reflections
transformation:
  action: reflection and placement
  details:
    - For each non-white input pixel at (r, c) with color C:
      - Calculate reflection coordinates:
        - vertical_reflection_row: r_v = H - 1 - r
        - horizontal_reflection_col: c_h = W - 1 - c
      - Identify four target output positions:
        - P1: (r, c)  # Original
        - P2: (r_v, c) # Vertical Reflection
        - P3: (r, c_h) # Horizontal Reflection
        - P4: (r_v, c_h) # Diagonal Reflection
      - Place color C at positions P1, P2, P3, P4 in the output grid.
  overlap_rule:
    - If multiple input pixels map to the same output position, the color from the input pixel processed later (typically based on row-major iteration order) overwrites the previous color.
  output_initialization:
    - The output grid starts as a blank grid (all white, 0) with the same dimensions as the input grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initializing all its pixels to the background color (white, 0).
2.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the grid.
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid, using its row index `r` (from 0 to H-1) and column index `c` (from 0 to W-1).
4.  If the color `C` of the input pixel at `(r, c)` is not white (i.e., `C != 0`):
    a.  Calculate the row index `r_v` corresponding to the reflection across the horizontal center axis: `r_v = H - 1 - r`.
    b.  Calculate the column index `c_h` corresponding to the reflection across the vertical center axis: `c_h = W - 1 - c`.
    c.  Set the pixel color in the output grid at the original location `(r, c)` to `C`.
    d.  Set the pixel color in the output grid at the vertically reflected location `(r_v, c)` to `C`.
    e.  Set the pixel color in the output grid at the horizontally reflected location `(r, c_h)` to `C`.
    f.  Set the pixel color in the output grid at the diagonally reflected location `(r_v, c_h)` to `C`.
5.  After iterating through all input pixels, the resulting output grid represents the final transformation. Note that if multiple input pixels cause a color to be placed at the same output location, the color from the last processed input pixel mapping to that location will prevail.
