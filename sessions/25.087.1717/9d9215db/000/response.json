            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Size:** All examples use a 19x19 grid for both input and output.\n2.  **Background:** The background color is consistently white (0).\n3.  **Input Content:** The input grids contain a few scattered, non-white pixels. These pixels seem to be located primarily in one quadrant in each example (top-right in train_1, top-left in train_2 and train_3).\n4.  **Output Content:** The output grids contain the original pixels from the input, plus additional pixels of the same colors. These new pixels complete a pattern that exhibits four-way symmetry (reflection across the central horizontal and vertical axes).\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be taking each non-white pixel in the input and adding its symmetrical counterparts in the other three quadrants relative to the grid's center. If a pixel at (row, col) exists, then pixels of the same color are added (or ensured to exist) at:\n    *   (row, width - 1 - col)  -- Horizontal reflection\n    *   (height - 1 - row, col) -- Vertical reflection\n    *   (height - 1 - row, width - 1 - col) -- Diagonal (180-degree rotation) reflection\n6.  **Objectness:** Individual pixels of non-white colors can be considered the primary objects.\n7.  **Geometry:** The transformation relies on geometric reflection across the grid's center lines.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
