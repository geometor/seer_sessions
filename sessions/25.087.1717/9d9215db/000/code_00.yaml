Grid_Properties:
  - Size: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - Background_Color: White (0) is the predominant background color.

Objects:
  - Type: Individual non-white pixels.
  - Properties:
      - Color: The specific color value (1-9).
      - Position: (row, column) coordinates within the grid.

Relationships:
  - Symmetry: Pixels in the output grid exhibit four-way symmetry (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal reflections) relative to the center of the grid.
  - Input_Output_Mapping: Every non-white pixel present in the input grid is also present in the output grid at the same location and with the same color.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - Calculate_Reflections: For each non-white pixel at (r, c) with color 'C', determine the coordinates of its three symmetrical reflections:
      - Horizontal: (r, width - 1 - c)
      - Vertical: (height - 1 - r, c)
      - Diagonal: (height - 1 - r, width - 1 - c)
  - Populate_Output: Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid. Then, for every identified non-white pixel and its calculated reflections, ensure a pixel of color 'C' exists at those coordinates in the output grid.
