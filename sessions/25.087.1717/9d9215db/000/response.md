Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Size:** All examples use a 19x19 grid for both input and output.
2.  **Background:** The background color is consistently white (0).
3.  **Input Content:** The input grids contain a few scattered, non-white pixels. These pixels seem to be located primarily in one quadrant in each example (top-right in train_1, top-left in train_2 and train_3).
4.  **Output Content:** The output grids contain the original pixels from the input, plus additional pixels of the same colors. These new pixels complete a pattern that exhibits four-way symmetry (reflection across the central horizontal and vertical axes).
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be taking each non-white pixel in the input and adding its symmetrical counterparts in the other three quadrants relative to the grid's center. If a pixel at (row, col) exists, then pixels of the same color are added (or ensured to exist) at:
    *   (row, width - 1 - col)  -- Horizontal reflection
    *   (height - 1 - row, col) -- Vertical reflection
    *   (height - 1 - row, width - 1 - col) -- Diagonal (180-degree rotation) reflection
6.  **Objectness:** Individual pixels of non-white colors can be considered the primary objects.
7.  **Geometry:** The transformation relies on geometric reflection across the grid's center lines.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - Size: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - Background_Color: White (0) is the predominant background color.

Objects:
  - Type: Individual non-white pixels.
  - Properties:
      - Color: The specific color value (1-9).
      - Position: (row, column) coordinates within the grid.

Relationships:
  - Symmetry: Pixels in the output grid exhibit four-way symmetry (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal reflections) relative to the center of the grid.
  - Input_Output_Mapping: Every non-white pixel present in the input grid is also present in the output grid at the same location and with the same color.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - Calculate_Reflections: For each non-white pixel at (r, c) with color 'C', determine the coordinates of its three symmetrical reflections:
      - Horizontal: (r, width - 1 - c)
      - Vertical: (height - 1 - r, c)
      - Diagonal: (height - 1 - r, width - 1 - c)
  - Populate_Output: Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid. Then, for every identified non-white pixel and its calculated reflections, ensure a pixel of color 'C' exists at those coordinates in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Get the dimensions (height H, width W) of the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid at coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) from `r=0` to `H-1` and `c=0` to `W-1`.
4.  If the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the input grid is not white (color is not 0):
    a.  Let the color of this pixel be `C`.
    b.  Calculate the coordinates for the horizontal reflection: (`r_h`, `c_h`) = (`r`, `W - 1 - c`).
    c.  Calculate the coordinates for the vertical reflection: (`r_v`, `c_v`) = (`H - 1 - r`, `c`).
    d.  Calculate the coordinates for the diagonal reflection: (`r_d`, `c_d`) = (`H - 1 - r`, `W - 1 - c`).
    e.  Set the pixel at (`r_h`, `c_h`) in the output grid to color `C`.
    f.  Set the pixel at (`r_v`, `c_v`) in the output grid to color `C`.
    g.  Set the pixel at (`r_d`, `c_d`) in the output grid to color `C`.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
