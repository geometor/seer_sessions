Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n2. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.\n3. If the pixel at (r, c) has a non-white color C:\n    a. Calculate the coordinates of its reflections:\n        - Vertical reflection row: r_v = height - 1 - r\n        - Horizontal reflection column: c_h = width - 1 - c\n    b. Draw four lines of color C onto the output grid:\n        i.   A horizontal line at row `r` connecting columns `c` and `c_h`.\n        ii.  A horizontal line at row `r_v` connecting columns `c` and `c_h`.\n        iii. A vertical line at column `c` connecting rows `r` and `r_v`.\n        iv.  A vertical line at column `c_h` connecting rows `r` and `r_v`.\n4. The final output grid is the result of drawing all these lines. Subsequent drawing operations overwrite previous pixel values at the same location if colors differ, but in this specific task, lines of the same color originating from different input pixels might overlap.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by drawing horizontal and vertical lines \n    connecting each non-white pixel with its reflections.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): A 2D list representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: A 2D list representing the transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Get the dimensions of the grid\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n    \n    # Initialize the output grid with white (0)\n    output_np = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Get the color of the current pixel\n            color = input_np[r, c]\n            \n            # Check if the current pixel is non-white\n            if color != 0:\n                # Calculate the coordinates for the reflections\n                r_v = height - 1 - r  # Vertical reflection row\n                c_h = width - 1 - c   # Horizontal reflection column\n                \n                # Determine start and end columns/rows for line drawing\n                c_start = min(c, c_h)\n                c_end = max(c, c_h)\n                r_start = min(r, r_v)\n                r_end = max(r, r_v)\n\n                # Draw horizontal line at original row r\n                output_np[r, c_start:c_end+1] = color\n                \n                # Draw horizontal line at vertically reflected row r_v\n                output_np[r_v, c_start:c_end+1] = color\n                \n                # Draw vertical line at original column c\n                output_np[r_start:r_end+1, c] = color\n                \n                # Draw vertical line at horizontally reflected column c_h\n                output_np[r_start:r_end+1, c_h] = color\n                \n    # Convert the final numpy array back to a list of lists\n    output_grid = output_np.tolist()\n    \n    return output_grid\n```"
