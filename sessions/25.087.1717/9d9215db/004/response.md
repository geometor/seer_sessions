**General Assessment**

The previous code correctly identified the core mechanism of reflecting non-white pixels across the horizontal and vertical centers of the grid. However, it incorrectly implemented the drawing step. Instead of drawing only the perimeter (frame) of the rectangle defined by a point and its reflections, the code filled the entire rectangle. This resulted in significantly more colored pixels in the transformed output compared to the expected output, leading to large pixel mismatch counts and visual differences. The strategy is to modify the drawing logic to create only the frame.

*Note on Corner Match (Transformed) Ex1:* One corner match failed because the filled rectangle from one input pixel overwrote the corner of another frame. This overlap issue needs careful handling when drawing frames. The pixel `(3, 5)` should be blue (`1`) according to the frame from `(3, 13)`, but it gets overwritten by yellow (`4`) from the filled rectangle originating from `(3, 15)`. If frames were drawn correctly, this might still be an issue if frames overlap. The rule for overlapping colors needs clarification, but usually, later drawing operations overwrite earlier ones.

**Note on Calculated Frame Pixels:** The `calculated_frame_non_white_pixels` matches the `transformed_output_non_white_pixels` in the failed code's output. This is because my calculation also used a simple overlay approach where later frames overwrite earlier ones at shared pixels, similar to how the incorrect fill logic worked. The key difference is the number of pixels *intended* to be drawn for each input point (frame vs. fill). The final pixel count depends on overlaps. The *expected* pixel counts (28, 36, 40) are much smaller, indicating frames are drawn, not fills.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at position (row `r`, column `c`).
3.  If the input pixel at (`r`, `c`) has a non-white color `C`:
    a.  Determine the grid's height `H` and width `W`.
    b.  Calculate the coordinates of its reflections:
        i.  Horizontal reflection column: `c_h = W - 1 - c`
        ii. Vertical reflection row: `r_v = H - 1 - r`
    c.  Define the four corner points of the reflection rectangle: `(r, c)`, `(r, c_h)`, `(r_v, c)`, and `(r_v, c_h)`.
    d.  Draw the rectangular frame defined by these four corners onto the output grid using color `C`. This involves drawing four lines:
        i.  A horizontal line at row `r` between columns `c` and `c_h` (inclusive).
        ii. A horizontal line at row `r_v` between columns `c` and `c_h` (inclusive).
        iii. A vertical line at column `c` between rows `r` and `r_v` (inclusive).
        iv. A vertical line at column `c_h` between rows `r` and `r_v` (inclusive).
    e.  Ensure that pixels drawn for subsequent frames overwrite any pixels previously drawn at the same location.
4.  Return the completed output grid.**General Assessment**

The previous code correctly identified the reflection mechanism but misinterpreted the drawing operation. Instead of drawing the *outline* (frame) of the rectangle formed by a non-white pixel and its reflections, the code filled the *entire* rectangle. This fundamental difference explains the significant discrepancies (large `Pixels Off` counts) between the `Transformed Output` and the `Expected Output` in all examples.

The strategy moving forward is to adjust the implementation to draw only the four lines constituting the perimeter of the reflection rectangle for each non-white input pixel.

**Metrics**

The analysis confirms the discrepancy arises from filling versus framing:

*The `Calculated Frame Pixels` matching the `Transformed Output Non-white Pixels` indicates that the overlap pattern produced by the incorrect fill logic happens to cover the same number of unique pixels as drawing overlapping frames with simple overwriting would. The crucial difference remains the *pattern* and *total area* covered compared to the expected output.*

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid having the same dimensions as the input grid, setting all its pixels to the background color (white, 0).
2.  For each pixel in the input grid located at coordinates (`r`, `c`):
3.  Check if the pixel's color `C` is non-white (not 0).
4.  If the pixel is non-white:
    a.  Get the height `H` and width `W` of the grid.
    b.  Calculate the coordinates of the vertically reflected row `r_v = H - 1 - r` and the horizontally reflected column `c_h = W - 1 - c`.
    c.  Determine the minimum and maximum row indices: `r_min = min(r, r_v)` and `r_max = max(r, r_v)`.
    d.  Determine the minimum and maximum column indices: `c_min = min(c, c_h)` and `c_max = max(c, c_h)`.
    e.  Draw the rectangular frame onto the output grid using color `C`:
        i.  Draw a horizontal line from (`r_min`, `c_min`) to (`r_min`, `c_max`).
        ii. Draw a horizontal line from (`r_max`, `c_min`) to (`r_max`, `c_max`).
        iii. Draw a vertical line from (`r_min`, `c_min`) to (`r_max`, `c_min`).
        iv. Draw a vertical line from (`r_min`, `c_max`) to (`r_max`, `c_max`).
    f.  Pixels painted during this step overwrite any previous colors at the same coordinates in the output grid.
