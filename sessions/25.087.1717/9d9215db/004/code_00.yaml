task_description: Generate a symmetrical pattern by drawing rectangular frames based on reflections of non-white input pixels.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - background_color: White (0) is the background color.
objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
      - color: An integer from 0-9, where 0 is white. Non-white pixels are the primary actors.
actions:
  - name: Initialize Output Grid
    details: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
  - name: Identify Non-White Pixels
    details: Iterate through the input grid to find all pixels with color != 0.
  - name: Calculate Reflections
    inputs: A non-white pixel at (r, c) with color C in a grid of height H and width W.
    outputs: Four key points:
      - Original: P_orig = (r, c)
      - Horizontal Reflection: P_h = (r, W - 1 - c)
      - Vertical Reflection: P_v = (H - 1 - r, c)
      - Diagonal Reflection: P_d = (H - 1 - r, W - 1 - c)
    details: These four points define the corners of a rectangle.
  - name: Draw Rectangular Frame
    inputs: The four corner points (P_orig, P_h, P_v, P_d) and the color C.
    outputs: Modified output grid.
    details: Draw four lines of color C on the output grid connecting the corners to form the perimeter of the rectangle:
      - Line 1: Horizontal between P_orig and P_h (at row r).
      - Line 2: Horizontal between P_v and P_d (at row H-1-r).
      - Line 3: Vertical between P_orig and P_v (at column c).
      - Line 4: Vertical between P_h and P_d (at column W-1-c).
    overlap_rule: If multiple frames are drawn, pixels drawn later overwrite previously drawn pixels at the same location.
final_output: The output grid after all frames for non-white input pixels have been drawn.
