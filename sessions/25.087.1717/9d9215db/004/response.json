            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core mechanism of reflecting non-white pixels across the horizontal and vertical centers of the grid. However, it incorrectly implemented the drawing step. Instead of drawing only the perimeter (frame) of the rectangle defined by a point and its reflections, the code filled the entire rectangle. This resulted in significantly more colored pixels in the transformed output compared to the expected output, leading to large pixel mismatch counts and visual differences. The strategy is to modify the drawing logic to create only the frame.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n| Metric                            | Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3 |\n| :-------------------------------- | :-------- | :-------- | :-------- |\n| Input Shape                       | (19, 19)  | (19, 19)  | (19, 19)  |\n| Non-white Input Pixels            | 4         | 4         | 5         |\n| Expected Output Non-white Pixels  | 28        | 36        | 40        |\n| Transformed Output Non-white Pixels | 152       | 120       | 152       |\n| Mismatched Pixels                 | 134       | 84        | 112       |\n| Corner Match (Expected)           | All True  | All True  | All True  |\n| Corner Match (Transformed)        | Mostly True* | All True  | All True  |\n| Calculated Frame Pixels**         | 152       | 120       | 152       |\n\n*Note on Corner Match (Transformed) Ex1:* One corner match failed because the filled rectangle from one input pixel overwrote the corner of another frame. This overlap issue needs careful handling when drawing frames. The pixel `(3, 5)` should be blue (`1`) according to the frame from `(3, 13)`, but it gets overwritten by yellow (`4`) from the filled rectangle originating from `(3, 15)`. If frames were drawn correctly, this might still be an issue if frames overlap. The rule for overlapping colors needs clarification, but usually, later drawing operations overwrite earlier ones.\n\n**Note on Calculated Frame Pixels:** The `calculated_frame_non_white_pixels` matches the `transformed_output_non_white_pixels` in the failed code's output. This is because my calculation also used a simple overlay approach where later frames overwrite earlier ones at shared pixels, similar to how the incorrect fill logic worked. The key difference is the number of pixels *intended* to be drawn for each input point (frame vs. fill). The final pixel count depends on overlaps. The *expected* pixel counts (28, 36, 40) are much smaller, indicating frames are drawn, not fills.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Instead of drawing the *outline* (frame) of the rectangle formed by a non-white pixel and its reflections, the code filled the *entire* rectangle. This fundamental difference explains the significant discrepancies (large `Pixels Off` counts) between the `Transformed Output` and the `Expected Output` in all examples.\n\nThe strategy moving forward is to adjust the implementation to draw only the four lines constituting the perimeter of the reflection rectangle for each non-white input pixel.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe analysis confirms the discrepancy arises from filling versus framing:\n\n| Metric                            | Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3 | Notes                                                                                                    |\n| :-------------------------------- | :-------- | :-------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Input Shape                       | (19, 19)  | (19, 19)  | (19, 19)  | Consistent dimensions.                                                                                   |\n| Non-white Input Pixels            | 4         | 4         | 5         | The number of objects triggering the transformation.                                                     |\n| Expected Output Non-white Pixels  | 28        | 36        | 40        | Represents the target pixel count for correctly drawn frames, accounting for overlaps.                     |\n| Transformed Output Non-white Pixels | 152       | 120       | 152       | Represents the pixel count from the incorrect filled-rectangle logic, accounting for overlaps.           |\n| Mismatched Pixels                 | 134       | 84        | 112       | High counts directly resulting from the frame vs. fill difference.                                        |\n| Corner Match (Expected)           | All True  | All True  | All True  | Confirms the expected output uses the reflection points as corners.                                     |\n| Calculated Frame Pixels*          | 152       | 120       | 152       | Number of pixels *if* frames were drawn without considering expected output overlaps (matches current code). |\n\n*The `Calculated Frame Pixels` matching the `Transformed Output Non-white Pixels` indicates that the overlap pattern produced by the incorrect fill logic happens to cover the same number of unique pixels as drawing overlapping frames with simple overwriting would.
