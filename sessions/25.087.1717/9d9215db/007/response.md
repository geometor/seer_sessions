"""
Transforms an input grid by creating a symmetrical pattern in the output grid based on the non-white pixels of the input.

The transformation maps each non-white input pixel to four specific output pixels: 
its original position, its reflection across the horizontal center axis, its 
reflection across the vertical center axis, and its reflection across both axes 
(diagonal reflection through the center). The output pixels retain the color of 
the original input pixel.

1. Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, 
   initializing all its pixels to the background color (white, 0).
2. Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the grid.
3. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid, using its row index `r` 
   (from 0 to H-1) and column index `c` (from 0 to W-1).
4. If the color `C` of the input pixel at `(r, c)` is not white (i.e., `C != 0`):
    a. Calculate the row index `r_v` corresponding to the reflection across 
       the horizontal center axis: `r_v = H - 1 - r`.
    b. Calculate the column index `c_h` corresponding to the reflection across 
       the vertical center axis: `c_h = W - 1 - c`.
    c. Set the pixel color in the output grid at the original location `(r, c)` to `C`.
    d. Set the pixel color in the output grid at the vertically reflected location `(r_v, c)` to `C`.
    e. Set the pixel color in the output grid at the horizontally reflected location `(r, c_h)` to `C`.
    f. Set the pixel color in the output grid at the diagonally reflected location `(r_v, c_h)` to `C`.
5. If multiple input pixels map to the same output location, the color from the 
   last processed input pixel mapping to that location will overwrite previous colors.
6. The final output grid contains the combined result of placing colors at all 
   calculated reflection points for every non-white input pixel.
