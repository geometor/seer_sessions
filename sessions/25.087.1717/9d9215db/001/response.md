"""
The transformation takes an input grid and generates an output grid of the same dimensions.
It identifies all non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid. 
For each non-white pixel at position (r, c) with color C, it ensures that pixels of color C exist at four positions in the output grid:
1. The original position: (r, c)
2. The horizontal reflection across the vertical center line: (r, width - 1 - c)
3. The vertical reflection across the horizontal center line: (height - 1 - r, c)
4. The diagonal reflection (180-degree rotation) through the center: (height - 1 - r, width - 1 - c)
The output grid is effectively the input grid overlaid with its horizontal, vertical, and diagonal reflections.
