"""
The transformation rule operates based on the adjacency and properties of objects (contiguous blocks of non-background color):

1.  **Single Pixel Expansion:** If two single pixels (1x1 objects) of different colors (A and B) are adjacent (sharing an edge or corner):
    a.  Identify the pixel with the *higher color index*. Let this be the 'expanding pixel' and the other be the 'static pixel'.
    b.  The expanding pixel's color paints a 3x3 cross shape centered at its original position.
    c.  Crucially, this painting only affects background (color 0) cells within the 3x3 cross area. The static pixel and any other non-background pixels remain untouched by this specific expansion.
    d.  Both pixels are considered 'processed' and cannot participate in further rules.

2.  **Adjacent Square Transformation:** If two solid square objects (X and Y) of the *same size* (NxN) but potentially different colors are adjacent along a full edge:
    a.  A new (3N)x(3N) area is defined, conceptually centered where square Y was located (specifically, the top-left of the 3N area is N units above and N units left of Y's top-left corner).
    b.  This (3N)x(3N) area in the output grid is filled entirely with the color of square X.
    c.  Square Y (its original color and NxN size) is then painted back into the central NxN block of this area (its original position).
    d.  Determine the relative position of X with respect to Y (Above, Below, Left, Right).
    e.  The NxN block within the (3N)x(3N) area that is in the *opposite* direction from the center relative to X's position is filled with the background color (0). (e.g., If X was Above Y, the block Below Y's original position within the 3N area is cleared).
    f.  Both squares X and Y are considered 'processed'. Note that X is effectively removed or overwritten by the new pattern.

3.  **Default Copy:** The output grid starts as a copy of the input. Objects not participating in Rule 1 or Rule 2 remain unchanged.

Priority: Rule 1 transformations are identified and applied first. Then, Rule 2 transformations are identified and applied to the *remaining* unprocessed objects.
