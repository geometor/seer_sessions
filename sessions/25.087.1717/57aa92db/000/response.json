            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The grid size varies slightly between examples but seems consistent within each example pair.\n2.  **Background:** The background is consistently white (0).\n3.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects made of contiguous blocks of non-white pixels. These objects vary in color and shape (single pixels, squares, crosses, U-shapes).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems localized and conditional, focusing on pairs of adjacent objects. Some objects remain unchanged, while others trigger specific modifications based on their properties and adjacency relationship.\n5.  **Key Patterns Observed:**\n    *   **Single Pixel Adjacency:** When two single pixels of different colors are adjacent, one color (let's call its object 'Y') expands into a 3x3 cross shape, while the other pixel ('X') remains unchanged. (Seen in train_2, train_3).\n    *   **Same-Size Square Adjacency:** When two solid squares of the *same size* (NxN) but potentially different colors (X and Y) are adjacent along an edge, a larger (3N x 3N) structure is created. This structure uses the color of one square (X), contains the other square (Y) in its center, and has a blank (white) NxN block placed in a position relative to the center that mirrors the original position of X relative to Y. The original square X is effectively replaced by this new structure. (Seen in train_1, train_3, train_4).\n    *   **No Change:** Objects that don't fit these adjacency patterns (like the blue 'U' in train_1, the azure cross in train_2, or pairs where shapes/sizes don't match the rules) are copied directly from input to output without modification.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet**\n\n"
