Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The grid size varies slightly between examples but seems consistent within each example pair.
2.  **Background:** The background is consistently white (0).
3.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects made of contiguous blocks of non-white pixels. These objects vary in color and shape (single pixels, squares, crosses, U-shapes).
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems localized and conditional, focusing on pairs of adjacent objects. Some objects remain unchanged, while others trigger specific modifications based on their properties and adjacency relationship.
5.  **Key Patterns Observed:**
    *   **Single Pixel Adjacency:** When two single pixels of different colors are adjacent, one color (let's call its object 'Y') expands into a 3x3 cross shape, while the other pixel ('X') remains unchanged. (Seen in train_2, train_3).
    *   **Same-Size Square Adjacency:** When two solid squares of the *same size* (NxN) but potentially different colors (X and Y) are adjacent along an edge, a larger (3N x 3N) structure is created. This structure uses the color of one square (X), contains the other square (Y) in its center, and has a blank (white) NxN block placed in a position relative to the center that mirrors the original position of X relative to Y. The original square X is effectively replaced by this new structure. (Seen in train_1, train_3, train_4).
    *   **No Change:** Objects that don't fit these adjacency patterns (like the blue 'U' in train_1, the azure cross in train_2, or pairs where shapes/sizes don't match the rules) are copied directly from input to output without modification.

**YAML Fact Sheet**


```yaml
task_description: Apply transformations based on adjacency rules between pairs of objects.

object_types:
  - single_pixel: A 1x1 object of a non-white color.
  - square: An NxN solid block of a non-white color.
  - other: Any other shape (e.g., cross, U-shape).

relationships:
  - adjacency: Objects sharing an edge or corner.
  - edge_adjacency: Objects sharing a full edge (not just a corner).
  - relative_position: Direction of one object relative to another (Above, Below, Left, Right).

rules:
  - rule_name: Single Pixel Expansion
    condition:
      - object_A is a single_pixel of color C_A.
      - object_B is a single_pixel of color C_B.
      - object_A and object_B are adjacent.
    action:
      - object_A remains unchanged in the output.
      - object_B is replaced by a 3x3 cross shape (center + 4 orthogonal neighbors) of color C_B, centered at object_B's original location.
    applies_to_examples: [train_2, train_3]

  - rule_name: Adjacent Square Transformation
    condition:
      - object_X is a square of size NxN and color C_X.
      - object_Y is a square of size NxN (same N) and color C_Y.
      - object_X and object_Y have edge_adjacency.
    action:
      - Determine the relative_position of X to Y (e.g., Above, Left).
      - Define a target area A of size (3N)x(3N), centered such that object_Y occupies the exact central NxN block of A.
      - Fill area A with C_X.
      - Place object_Y (color C_Y, size NxN) back into the central NxN block of A.
      - Identify the NxN block within A that is in the opposite relative position from the center block compared to X's original position relative to Y (e.g., if X was Above Y, target the block Below Y).
      - Fill the identified "opposite" NxN block with white (0).
      - This pattern overwrites the corresponding region in the output grid, replacing object_X.
    applies_to_examples: [train_1, train_3, train_4]

  - rule_name: Default Copy
    condition: An object does not participate as A, B, X, or Y in the above rules.
    action: Copy the object unchanged from input to output.
    applies_to_examples: [train_1, train_2, train_3, train_4]

grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0).
  - boundaries: Transformations must respect grid boundaries.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct, non-white objects in the input grid, noting their color, location, shape, and size (especially if they are single pixels or squares).
3.  Find all pairs of single pixels (object A, object B) that are adjacent. For each such pair found:
    a.  In the output grid, expand object B into a 3x3 cross shape of its color, centered at its original position. Leave object A as it is.
    b.  Mark both A and B as processed to prevent re-processing under other rules or pairings.
4.  Find all pairs of same-size square objects (object X size NxN, object Y size NxN) that share a full edge. For each such pair found that hasn't already been processed:
    a.  Determine the relative position of X to Y (Above, Below, Left, or Right).
    b.  Calculate the region for a new (3N)x(3N) area centered on object Y's location.
    c.  In the output grid, fill this (3N)x(3N) area with the color of X.
    d.  Draw object Y (its color and NxN size) in the central NxN block of this area.
    e.  Determine the NxN block within the (3N)x(3N) area that is diagonally opposite the original position of X relative to Y's center block (e.g., if X was Above Y, blank the block Below Y; if X was Left of Y, blank the block Right of Y).
    f.  Fill this "opposite" NxN block with white (0).
    g.  Mark both X and Y as processed.
5.  Ensure all modifications stay within the grid boundaries.
6.  Return the modified output grid. Any objects not marked as processed remain as they were in the initial copy.
