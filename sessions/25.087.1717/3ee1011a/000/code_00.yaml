Input:
  - type: grid
  - background_color: white (0)
  - elements:
      - type: object
      - properties:
          - color: non-white (1-9)
          - shape: contiguous pixels of the same color (lines, rectangles, single pixels)
          - location: position within the grid
          - bounding_box: minimal rectangle enclosing all pixels of the object's color
          - bounding_box_area: height * width of the bounding box

Output:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      - shape: square
      - size: Determined by the number of unique input colors (n) and the minimum bounding_box_area (min_area) among input objects.
          - if min_area == 1: size = 2n - 1
          - if min_area > 1: size = 2n
      - composition: Concentric square frames/layers of color.
      - colors: Uses the unique non-white colors from the input.

Transformation:
  - action: identify_colors
    - input: input grid
    - output: set of unique non-white colors (C)
  - action: find_bounding_boxes
    - input: input grid, set of unique colors (C)
    - output: mapping from each color c in C to its minimal bounding_box and bounding_box_area
  - action: sort_colors
    - input: mapping of colors to bounding_box_areas
    - output: list of colors sorted by descending bounding_box_area (Sorted_C)
  - action: determine_output_size
    - input: number of unique colors (n), minimum bounding_box_area (min_area)
    - output: grid size (s)
  - action: construct_output_grid
    - input: grid size (s), sorted list of colors (Sorted_C)
    - process: Create an s x s grid. Fill concentric layers starting from the outside (layer 0) with colors from Sorted_C[0] to Sorted_C[n-1]. Layer k uses color Sorted_C[k]. The innermost region (layer n-1) uses Sorted_C[n-1].
    - output: output grid

Relationships:
  - The order of colors in the output layers is determined by the descending order of the bounding box areas of the corresponding objects in the input.
  - The size of the output grid depends on the number of unique colors and whether the object with the smallest bounding box area is a single pixel (area 1) or larger.
