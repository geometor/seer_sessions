            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Composition**: The input grids contain a white background (color 0) and several distinct \"objects\". Each object is a contiguous shape (lines, rectangles, or single pixels) of a single non-white color.\n2.  **Output Composition**: The output grids are always square and smaller than the input grids. They consist of concentric square frames or layers of color, filling the entire output grid. The colors used in the output are precisely the non-white colors present in the input.\n3.  **Color Mapping**: The specific non-white colors from the input objects are directly used to color the layers in the output grid.\n4.  **Object Properties**: The key properties of the input objects seem to be their color and their spatial extent, specifically the area of their minimal bounding box.\n5.  **Transformation**: The transformation involves:\n    *   Identifying all unique non-white colors and their corresponding objects in the input.\n    *   Calculating the area of the minimal bounding box for each unique color's object(s).\n    *   Sorting the colors based on these bounding box areas in descending order. This order determines the layering of colors in the output, from the outermost frame to the innermost region.\n    *   Determining the size of the output square grid based on the number of unique colors (`n`) and the area of the object with the *smallest* bounding box (`min_area`). If `min_area` is 1, the size is `(2n - 1) x (2n - 1)`. If `min_area` is greater than 1, the size is `2n x 2n`.\n    *   Constructing the output grid by drawing concentric frames using the sorted colors, starting with the color corresponding to the largest bounding box area for the outermost frame and ending with the color corresponding to the smallest bounding box area for the center region.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
