Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Composition**: The input grids contain a white background (color 0) and several distinct "objects". Each object is a contiguous shape (lines, rectangles, or single pixels) of a single non-white color.
2.  **Output Composition**: The output grids are always square and smaller than the input grids. They consist of concentric square frames or layers of color, filling the entire output grid. The colors used in the output are precisely the non-white colors present in the input.
3.  **Color Mapping**: The specific non-white colors from the input objects are directly used to color the layers in the output grid.
4.  **Object Properties**: The key properties of the input objects seem to be their color and their spatial extent, specifically the area of their minimal bounding box.
5.  **Transformation**: The transformation involves:
    *   Identifying all unique non-white colors and their corresponding objects in the input.
    *   Calculating the area of the minimal bounding box for each unique color's object(s).
    *   Sorting the colors based on these bounding box areas in descending order. This order determines the layering of colors in the output, from the outermost frame to the innermost region.
    *   Determining the size of the output square grid based on the number of unique colors (`n`) and the area of the object with the *smallest* bounding box (`min_area`). If `min_area` is 1, the size is `(2n - 1) x (2n - 1)`. If `min_area` is greater than 1, the size is `2n x 2n`.
    *   Constructing the output grid by drawing concentric frames using the sorted colors, starting with the color corresponding to the largest bounding box area for the outermost frame and ending with the color corresponding to the smallest bounding box area for the center region.

## Facts


```yaml
Input:
  - type: grid
  - background_color: white (0)
  - elements:
      - type: object
      - properties:
          - color: non-white (1-9)
          - shape: contiguous pixels of the same color (lines, rectangles, single pixels)
          - location: position within the grid
          - bounding_box: minimal rectangle enclosing all pixels of the object's color
          - bounding_box_area: height * width of the bounding box

Output:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      - shape: square
      - size: Determined by the number of unique input colors (n) and the minimum bounding_box_area (min_area) among input objects.
          - if min_area == 1: size = 2n - 1
          - if min_area > 1: size = 2n
      - composition: Concentric square frames/layers of color.
      - colors: Uses the unique non-white colors from the input.

Transformation:
  - action: identify_colors
    - input: input grid
    - output: set of unique non-white colors (C)
  - action: find_bounding_boxes
    - input: input grid, set of unique colors (C)
    - output: mapping from each color c in C to its minimal bounding_box and bounding_box_area
  - action: sort_colors
    - input: mapping of colors to bounding_box_areas
    - output: list of colors sorted by descending bounding_box_area (Sorted_C)
  - action: determine_output_size
    - input: number of unique colors (n), minimum bounding_box_area (min_area)
    - output: grid size (s)
  - action: construct_output_grid
    - input: grid size (s), sorted list of colors (Sorted_C)
    - process: Create an s x s grid. Fill concentric layers starting from the outside (layer 0) with colors from Sorted_C[0] to Sorted_C[n-1]. Layer k uses color Sorted_C[k]. The innermost region (layer n-1) uses Sorted_C[n-1].
    - output: output grid

Relationships:
  - The order of colors in the output layers is determined by the descending order of the bounding box areas of the corresponding objects in the input.
  - The size of the output grid depends on the number of unique colors and whether the object with the smallest bounding box area is a single pixel (area 1) or larger.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid to identify all unique non-white pixel colors present. Let `n` be the count of these unique colors.
2.  For each unique non-white color identified:
    *   Find all pixels in the input grid that have this color.
    *   Determine the minimal bounding box that encloses all these pixels.
    *   Calculate the area of this bounding box (height multiplied by width).
    *   Store the color and its associated bounding box area.
3.  Sort the unique colors based on their associated bounding box areas in descending order (largest area first). Let this sorted list of colors be `[color_1, color_2, ..., color_n]`.
4.  Identify the smallest bounding box area among all the unique colors (this will be the area associated with `color_n`). Let this be `min_area`.
5.  Calculate the side length `s` for the square output grid:
    *   If `min_area` is equal to 1, then `s = (2 * n) - 1`.
    *   If `min_area` is greater than 1, then `s = 2 * n`.
6.  Create a new square grid of size `s x s`.
7.  Fill the grid with concentric layers of color, starting from the outermost layer and moving inwards:
    *   The outermost layer (layer 0, the border pixels from index 0 to `s-1`) is filled with `color_1`.
    *   The next layer inwards (layer 1, the border pixels from index 1 to `s-2`) is filled with `color_2`.
    *   Continue this process for subsequent layers `k`, filling the border pixels from index `k` to `s-1-k` with `color_(k+1)`.
    *   The final central region (layer `n-1`) will be filled with `color_n`. If `s` is odd, this region is a single pixel. If `s` is even, this region is a 2x2 square.
