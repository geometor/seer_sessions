Identifies a 3x3 subgrid structure within the input grid. The structure is defined by horizontal and vertical lines of a single, non-background color (the 'separator color').\n2.  Extracts the pattern 'C' from the central subgrid (at index 1, 1).\n3.  Identifies the single primary color 'P' present within pattern C, excluding the background color (assumed to be 0) and the separator color. This color 'P' acts as the 'trigger color'.\n4.  If the central subgrid C does not contain exactly one such primary color P (e.g., it's empty, contains only background/separator, or multiple colors), the function returns the original input grid unchanged.\n5.  Creates a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n6.  Iterates through the subgrids in the top two rows of the 3x3 structure (row indices 0 and 1).\n7.  For each subgrid at index (r, c) in these top two rows, it examines the subgrid directly below it, at index (r+1, c).\n8.  If any pixel within the subgrid below (r+1, c) matches the trigger color P, the content of the current subgrid (r, c) in the output grid is replaced entirely by the central pattern C.\n9.  If the subgrid below (r+1, c) does not contain the trigger color P, the content of the current subgrid (r, c) remains unchanged in the output grid.\n10. Subgrids in the bottom row (row index 2) are never modified.\n11. Returns the potentially modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_grid_structure(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the separator color, subgrid dimensions, and boundaries.\n    Assumes a 3x3 grid separated by single-pixel lines of a uniform color.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (separator_color, subgrid_h, subgrid_w, boundaries, background_color)\n               boundaries is a 3x3 list of tuples (r_start, r_end, c_start, c_end).\n               Returns (None, -1, -1, None, -1) if structure is not found or invalid.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    separator_color = -1\n    separator_rows = []\n    separator_cols = []\n    background_color = 0 # Standard ARC background\n\n    # Find potential separator color and rows by checking for monochromatic rows\n    # not matching the background color.\n    for r in range(rows):\n        unique_colors = np.unique(grid[r, :])\n        if len(unique_colors) == 1 and unique_colors[0] != background_color:\n            # Assign the first such color found as the potential separator color\n            if separator_color == -1:\n                separator_color = unique_colors[0]\n            # If the row color matches the potential separator color, add its index\n            if unique_colors[0] == separator_color:\n                 separator_rows.append(r)\n\n    # If no separator color found from rows, or separator color is invalid, fail.\n    if separator_color == -1:\n        return None, -1, -1, None, background_color\n\n    # Find potential separator columns matching the determined separator color\n    for c in range(cols):\n        unique_colors = np.unique(grid[:, c])\n        if len(unique_colors) == 1 and unique_colors[0] == separator_color:\n             separator_cols.append(c)\n\n    # Expect exactly 2 separator rows and 2 separator columns for a 3x3 grid\n    if len(separator_rows) != 2 or len(separator_cols) != 2:\n        return None, -1, -1, None, background_color\n\n    # Determine subgrid dimensions from the first separator lines\n    subgrid_h = separator_rows[0]\n    subgrid_w = separator_cols[0]\n    \n    # Check for positive dimensions\n    if subgrid_h <= 0 or subgrid_w <= 0:\n         return None, -1, -1, None, background_color\n\n    # Verify that the second separator lines are positioned correctly for uniform subgrids\n    if separator_rows[1] != 2 * subgrid_h + 1 or separator_cols[1] != 2 * subgrid_w + 1:\n        return None, -1, -1, None, background_color\n\n    # Verify overall grid dimensions match the structure\n    expected_rows = 3 * subgrid_h + 2\n    expected_cols = 3 * subgrid_w + 2\n    if rows != expected_rows or cols != expected_cols:\n         return None, -1, -1, None, background_color\n\n    # Calculate subgrid boundaries (top-left inclusive, bottom-right exclusive)\n    boundaries = [[(0, 0, 0, 0) for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    for r_idx in range(3):\n        r_start = r_idx * (subgrid_h + 1)\n        r_end = r_start + subgrid_h\n        for c_idx in range(3):\n            c_start = c_idx * (subgrid_w + 1)\n            c_end = c_start + subgrid_w\n            boundaries[r_idx][c_idx] = (r_start, r_end, c_start, c_end)\n\n    return separator_color, subgrid_h, subgrid_w, boundaries, background_color\n\n\ndef _get_subgrid(grid, boundaries):\n    \"\"\"Extracts a subgrid view from the main grid based on boundaries.\"\"\"\n    r_start, r_end, c_start, c_end = boundaries\n    return grid[r_start:r_end, c_start:c_end]\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the conditional subgrid replacement transformation.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of list of int): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of list of int: The transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to numpy array for efficient processing\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    # Create a copy to modify, preserving the original input\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n\n    # Step 1: Identify the grid structure (separator, dimensions, boundaries)\n    separator_color, subgrid_h, subgrid_w, boundaries, background_color = _find_grid_structure(grid)\n\n    # If structure is invalid or not found, return the original grid\n    if boundaries is None:\n        # print(\"Warning: Could not determine grid structure.
