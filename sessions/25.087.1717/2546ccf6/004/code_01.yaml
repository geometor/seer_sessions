task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  structure: 3x3 grid of subgrids separated by lines
  separator_lines:
    color: uniform, non-background (most frequent non-background color)
    thickness: 1 pixel
    completeness:
      horizontal: typically complete (single color)
      vertical: may contain background pixels alongside the separator color
  subgrids:
    size: uniform height (H) and width (W) determined by separators
    content: variable patterns of colors, including background
  padding: input grid may contain background padding outside the core 3x3 structure
transformation:
  trigger:
    source: central subgrid (1, 1)
    determination: identify the unique non-background, non-separator color (P) within the central subgrid
    condition: requires exactly one such color P to exist; otherwise, no transformation occurs.
  action: conditional replacement of subgrids
  scope: affects subgrids in the top two rows (row indices 0 and 1)
  rule: for each subgrid S at position (r, c) where r is 0 or 1:
    condition: examine the subgrid SB directly below S in the input grid, at position (r+1, c).
    check: determine if the trigger color P exists anywhere within SB.
    outcome_true: if P is found in SB, replace the content of S in the output grid with the content of SB from the input grid.
    outcome_false: if P is not found in SB, the content of S in the output grid remains unchanged from the input grid.
  unaffected: subgrids in the bottom row (row index 2) are never modified.
output: a grid of the same dimensions as the input, potentially modified according to the rule.
