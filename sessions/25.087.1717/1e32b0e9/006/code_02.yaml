task_structure:
  grid_size: [17, 17]
  background_color: 0 # white
  dividers:
    type: Grid lines
    location:
      rows: [5, 11] # 0-indexed
      columns: [5, 11] # 0-indexed
    properties:
      - Solid lines (one pixel thick)
      - Consistent color per example (defines divider_color)
  sections:
    count: 9
    layout: 3x3 grid formed by dividers
    indices: # Row/Column ranges (exclusive of dividers)
      - Rows: [0-4, 6-10, 12-16]
      - Cols: [0-4, 6-10, 12-16]
    size: [5, 5] # Each section's dimensions
    content: Can contain background, object_color pixels, or only background
objects:
  - type: Object pixels
    properties:
      - Single color per example (defines object_color)
      - Distinct from background_color and divider_color
      - Found only within the 5x5 sections (not on divider lines)
      - Presence within a section triggers a transformation
    identity: Preserved in the output grid (color and position)
  - type: Divider lines
    properties:
      - Single color per example (divider_color)
      - Form the static grid structure
    identity: Preserved in the output grid (color and position)
actions:
  - name: Identify Colors and Structure
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: divider_color, object_color, background_color
    description: >
      Verify grid is 17x17. Identify background_color (0).
      Determine divider_color from consistent color at rows 5, 11 and columns 5, 11.
      Identify object_color as the unique color within the 5x5 sections that is not background_color or divider_color.
  - name: Process Sections Conditionally
    inputs: input_grid, output_grid (initially a copy), divider_color, object_color, background_color
    outputs: modified output_grid
    description: >
      Iterate through the 9 section locations defined by row/column indices [0-4, 6-10, 12-16].
      For each section location:
        1. Check the corresponding 5x5 area in the input_grid.
        2. If any pixel in that input area equals object_color:
           a. Identify the corresponding 5x5 area in the output_grid.
           b. For every pixel within this output area that equals background_color (0), change its value to divider_color.
        3. If no pixel in the input area equals object_color, make no changes to the output_grid section.
