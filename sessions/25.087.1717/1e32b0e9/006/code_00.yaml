task_structure:
  grid_size: [17, 17] # Consistent across examples
  background_color: 0 # Consistent white background
  dividers:
    type: Grid lines
    location:
      rows: [5, 11] # 0-indexed
      columns: [5, 11] # 0-indexed
    properties:
      - Solid lines (one pixel thick)
      - Consistent color per example (divider_color)
  sections:
    count: 9
    layout: 3x3 grid formed by dividers
    size: [5, 5] # Each section's dimensions
    content: Can contain background, object_color pixels, or be empty (only background)
objects:
  - type: Main object pixels
    properties:
      - Single color per example (object_color)
      - Distinct from background_color and divider_color
      - Can appear as disconnected shapes within one or more sections
      - Location determines section transformation
    identity: Preserved in the output grid
  - type: Divider lines
    properties:
      - Single color per example (divider_color)
      - Form the grid structure
    identity: Preserved in the output grid
actions:
  - name: Identify colors
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: divider_color, object_color
    description: Determine the divider color from lines at rows/cols 5 & 11, and the unique non-background, non-divider color within the 5x5 sections.
  - name: Process sections
    inputs: input_grid, divider_color, object_color
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Iterate through each 5x5 section.
  - name: Conditional fill
    scope: Within each section processing
    condition: If the section in the input_grid contains any pixel of object_color.
    action: In the output_grid's corresponding section, change all pixels with background_color (0) to divider_color.
    effect: Fills the background of sections containing objects, leaves other sections and non-background pixels untouched.
