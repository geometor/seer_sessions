## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids consistently feature a structure defined by two horizontal lines and two vertical lines of a single, non-white color (let's call this the "divider color"). In the examples, these colors are red (2), azure (8), and blue (1). These lines divide the grid into nine distinct rectangular sections (a 3x3 arrangement of sections).
2.  **Divider Lines:** The divider lines are always located at the 6th and 12th rows (index 5 and 11) and the 6th and 12th columns (index 5 and 11). These lines remain unchanged between the input and output.
3.  **Sections:** The nine sections are the areas bounded by the divider lines and the grid edges.
4.  **Content Objects:** Within some of these sections in the input grid, there are distinct shapes or pixels of another non-white color (let's call this the "object color"). In the examples, these are blue (1), red (2), and green (3) respectively. These object pixels also remain unchanged in the output.
5.  **Background:** The default background color within the sections is white (0).
6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the background color (white pixels) within certain sections. A section's background is filled with the "divider color" *if and only if* that section contains at least one pixel of the "object color" in the input grid. Sections containing only white pixels (besides the bounding divider lines) remain unchanged.

transformation:
  type: Conditional background fill within sections
  condition: A section must contain at least one pixel of 'object_color' in the input.
  action: If the condition is met for a section, change all 'background_color' (white, 0) pixels within that section to the 'divider_color'.
  scope: Applies independently to each of the 9 sections.
  invariant_pixels: Pixels matching 'divider_color' or 'object_color' are never changed.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Grid Structure:** Determine the color of the horizontal and vertical divider lines ("divider\_color"). These lines define nine distinct rectangular sections within the grid.
2.  **Identify Object Color:** Determine the primary color ("object\_color") used for shapes/pixels within the sections, excluding the background (white, 0) and the "divider\_color".
3.  **Iterate Through Sections:** Examine each of the nine sections independently.
4.  **Check for Object Presence:** For the current section, check if it contains any pixels of the "object\_color".
5.  **Apply Conditional Fill:**
    *   **If** the section contains at least one pixel of the "object\_color": Change all pixels within that section that are currently background color (white, 0) to the "divider\_color".
    *   **Else** (the section contains only background color or divider color pixels): Leave the section unchanged.
6.  **Output:** The resulting grid, with modified section backgrounds where applicable, is the output. The original divider lines and object color pixels remain untouched.
