Identify the 'object_color': Find the color used for shapes/pixels within the sections, which is neither the background (white, 0) nor the 'divider_color'.\n3. Iterate through each of the 9 sections.\n4. For each section, check if it contains any pixel of the 'object_color'.\n5. If a section contains the 'object_color', change all background (white, 0) pixels within that section to the 'divider_color'.\n6. Otherwise, leave the section unchanged.\n7.
