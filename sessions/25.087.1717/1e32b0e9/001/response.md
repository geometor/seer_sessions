Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the grid structure: The grid is divided into 9 sections by two horizontal and two vertical lines of a single 'divider_color' (located at rows/columns 5 and 11).
2. Identify the 'object_color': Find the color used for shapes/pixels within the sections, which is neither the background (white, 0) nor the 'divider_color'.
3. Iterate through each of the 9 sections.
4. For each section, check if it contains any pixel of the 'object_color'.
5. If a section contains the 'object_color', change all background (white, 0) pixels within that section to the 'divider_color'.
6. Otherwise, leave the section unchanged.
7. The divider lines and object pixels themselves remain unmodified.
