task_description: Fill background of grid sections based on content.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: 17x17 (consistent across examples)
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - structure: Divided into 9 sections by divider lines.
  - divider_lines:
      - type: horizontal
      - location: row 5 and row 11
      - type: vertical
      - location: column 5 and column 11
      - color: Varies per example (e.g., Red, Azure, Blue), but consistent within an example.
  - sections:
      - definition: 9 rectangular areas defined by the divider lines (excluding the lines themselves).
      - coordinates:
          - Top-Left: rows 0-4, cols 0-4
          - Top-Center: rows 0-4, cols 6-10
          - Top-Right: rows 0-4, cols 12-16
          - Mid-Left: rows 6-10, cols 0-4
          - Mid-Center: rows 6-10, cols 6-10
          - Mid-Right: rows 6-10, cols 12-16
          - Bottom-Left: rows 12-16, cols 0-4
          - Bottom-Center: rows 12-16, cols 6-10
          - Bottom-Right: rows 12-16, cols 12-16

object_properties:
  - role: Content indicator within sections.
  - color: Varies per example (e.g., Blue, Red, Green), distinct from background and divider colors.
  - representation: One or more pixels of the object color within a section.

actions:
  - 1: Identify the divider color from the divider lines.
  - 2: Identify the object color (pixels within sections that are not background or divider color).
  - 3: Iterate through each of the 9 defined sections in the input grid.
  - 4: Check if the current section contains at least one pixel of the object color.
  - 5: Conditional Fill:
      - IF the section contains the object color:
          - THEN change all background pixels (color 0) within that section to the divider color in the output grid.
      - ELSE (the section does not contain the object color):
          - THEN leave the section unchanged from the input grid.
  - 6: Preserve original pixels: Divider lines and object color pixels are never modified.

output: A new grid reflecting the conditional background fills in the relevant sections.
