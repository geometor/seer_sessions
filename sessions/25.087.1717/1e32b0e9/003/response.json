Identify the solid horizontal lines at row 5 and row 11, and the solid vertical lines at column 5 and column 11. Determine the single color used for these divider lines (the `divider_color`). Note the background color is white (0).\n2.  **Identify Object Color:** Scan the grid *excluding* the divider lines. Find the color present that is neither the background color (0) nor the `divider_color`. This is the `object_color`.\n3.  **Define Sections:** Mentally (or actually) divide the grid into nine 5x5 sections based on the divider lines (rows 0-4, 6-10, 12-16 and columns 0-4, 6-10, 12-16).\n4.  **Process Sections:** Iterate through each of the nine sections.\n5.  **Check for Object:** For the current section, determine if any pixel within its boundaries has the `object_color`.\n6.  **Apply Transformation:** Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    *   If the current section *contains* the `object_color`: Find all pixels within this section in the output grid that are currently the background color (0) and change their color to the `divider_color`.\n    *   If the current section *does not contain* the `object_color`: Make no changes to this section in the output grid.\n7.  **Final Output:** The resulting modified grid is the final output. The divider lines and the original object pixels remain unchanged throughout the process.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_colors_and_dividers(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the divider color and the object color in the grid.\n    Assumes dividers are at fixed positions (row/col 5 and 11) and are consistent.\n    Assumes a single object color exists besides white (0) and the divider color within sections.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid as a NumPy array.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (divider_color, object_color)\n               Returns None for object_color if it cannot be determined.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Determine divider color from a known divider pixel\n    # Assuming the grid is at least 6x1, row 5 exists.\n    divider_color = grid[5, 0]\n\n    object_color = None\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # Define section boundaries (excluding divider lines themselves)\n    # Section row ranges: 0-4, 6-10, 12-(rows-1)\n    # Section col ranges: 0-4, 6-10, 12-(cols-1)\n    section_row_ranges = [(0, 5), (6, 11), (12, rows)]\n    section_col_ranges = [(0, 5), (6, 11), (12, cols)]\n\n    # Search within sections for the object color\n    found_object_color = False\n    for r_start, r_end in section_row_ranges:\n        if found_object_color:\n            break\n        for c_start, c_end in section_col_ranges:\n            if found_object_color:\n                break\n            # Extract the current section from the input grid\n            section = grid[r_start:r_end, c_start:c_end]\n            # Find unique colors in this section\n            unique_in_section = np.unique(section)\n            for color in unique_in_section:\n                # Check if the color is neither background nor divider\n                if color != 0 and color != divider_color:\n                    object_color = color\n                    found_object_color = True # Stop searching once found\n                    break # Exit inner color loop\n\n    # Basic check if object color was found (it should be based on examples)\n    if object_color is None:\n         print(f\"Warning: Could not find a distinct object color (Divider: {divider_color}).\")\n         # Optionally, implement a fallback or raise an error if needed.\n         # For this task, we expect an object color to exist.\n\n    return divider_color, object_color\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the conditional background fill transformation based on object presence in sections.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to numpy array for efficient processing\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    # Create a copy to modify for the output\n    output_grid_np = np.copy(input_grid_np)\n    rows, cols = input_grid_np.shape\n\n    # 1. & 2.
