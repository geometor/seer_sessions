In the examples, these colors are red (2), azure (8), and blue (1). These lines divide the grid into nine distinct rectangular sections (a 3x3 arrangement of sections).\n2.  **Divider Lines:** The divider lines are always located at the 6th and 12th rows (index 5 and 11) and the 6th and 12th columns (index 5 and 11). These lines remain unchanged between the input and output.\n3.  **Sections:** The nine sections are the areas bounded by the divider lines and the grid edges.\n4.  **Content Objects:** Within some of these sections in the input grid, there are distinct shapes or pixels of another non-white color (let's call this the \"object color\"). In the examples, these are blue (1), red (2), and green (3) respectively. These object pixels also remain unchanged in the output.\n5.  **Background:** The default background color within the sections is white (0).\n6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the background color (white pixels) within certain sections. A section's background is filled with the \"divider color\" *if and only if* that section contains at least one pixel of the \"object color\" in the input grid. Sections containing only white pixels (besides the bounding divider lines) remain unchanged.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
