grid_properties:
  size: 17x17
structure:
  dividers:
    type: Grid lines
    orientation: [horizontal, vertical]
    count: 2 each
    position:
      horizontal: [row 5, row 11]
      vertical: [column 5, column 11]
    color: 'divider_color' (variable per example: red(2), azure(8), blue(1))
    role: Defines 9 sections
  sections:
    layout: 3x3 grid of rectangles
    boundaries: Defined by dividers and grid edges
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: divider_lines
    properties:
      color: divider_color
      position: Fixed (rows 5, 11; cols 5, 11)
      persistence: Unchanged in output
  - type: content_shapes
    properties:
      color: 'object_color' (variable per example: blue(1), red(2), green(3))
      location: Within one or more sections
      persistence: Unchanged in output
transformation:
  type: Conditional background fill within sections
  condition: A section must contain at least one pixel of 'object_color' in the input.
  action: If the condition is met for a section, change all 'background_color' (white, 0) pixels within that section to the 'divider_color'.
  scope: Applies independently to each of the 9 sections.
  invariant_pixels: Pixels matching 'divider_color' or 'object_color' are never changed.
