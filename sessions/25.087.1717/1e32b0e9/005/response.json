Identify the solid horizontal lines at row 5 and row 11, and the solid vertical lines at column 5 and column 11. Determine the single color used for these divider lines (the `divider_color`). Note the background color is white (0).\n2.  **Identify Object Color:** Scan the grid *excluding* the divider lines. Find the color present that is neither the background color (0) nor the `divider_color`. This is the `object_color`.\n3.  **Define Sections:** Mentally (or actually) divide the grid into nine 5x5 sections based on the divider lines (rows 0-4, 6-10, 12-16 and columns 0-4, 6-10, 12-16).\n4.  **Process Sections:** Iterate through each of the nine sections.\n5.  **Check for Object:** For the current section, determine if any pixel within its boundaries in the *input* grid has the `object_color`.\n6.  **Apply Transformation:** Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    *   If the current section in the *input* grid *contains* the `object_color`: Find all pixels within this section in the *output* grid that are currently the background color (0) and change their color to the `divider_color`. Leave other pixels (object pixels, divider pixels already copied) unchanged within this section.\n    *   If the current section in the *input* grid *does not contain* the `object_color`: Make no changes to this section in the output grid (it remains identical to the input section).\n7.  **Final Output:** The resulting modified grid is the final output. The divider lines and the original object pixels remain unchanged throughout the process.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_colors_and_dividers(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the divider color and the object color in the grid.\n    Assumes dividers are at fixed positions (row/col 5 and 11) and are consistent.\n    Assumes a single object color exists besides white (0) and the divider color within sections.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid as a NumPy array.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (divider_color, object_color)\n               Returns None for object_color if it cannot be determined.\n               Returns None for divider_color if structure is not as expected.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    background_color = 0\n\n    # Basic check for expected grid size\n    if rows != 17 or cols != 17:\n        print(f\"Warning: Grid dimensions ({rows}x{cols}) are not the expected 17x17.\")\n        # Attempt to proceed if possible, but might fail later\n        # For this specific task based on examples, we expect 17x17\n        # If the structure is different, this logic won't work.\n        # A more robust solution would dynamically find dividers.\n        # Here, we'll assume fixed dividers based on the problem's pattern.\n        # Set divider lines based on typical structure\n        divider_rows = [5, 11]\n        divider_cols = [5, 11]\n        if not (rows > max(divider_rows) and cols > max(divider_cols)):\n             print(\"Error: Grid too small for expected dividers.\")\n             return None, None # Cannot determine colors\n    else:\n        divider_rows = [5, 11]\n        divider_cols = [5, 11]\n\n\n    # 1.
