The provided code implemented this initial hypothesis directly.\n\nAnalysis of Example 3 shows:\n- The input grid contains multiple 3x3 squares of white pixels.\n- The previous code correctly identified these white squares.\n- However, the *expected output* only transforms *some* of these white squares into blue squares.\n- Specifically, where 3x3 white squares overlap in the input, only the one whose top-left corner appears earliest in a standard top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan is transformed in the expected output. The previous code transformed all identified 3x3 white squares, leading to incorrect extra blue pixels in the overlapping region for Example 3.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the transformation rule to account for this overlapping behavior. The rule should prioritize the transformation based on the position of the top-left corner of the 3x3 white square.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's examine Example 3 in detail to confirm the overlapping pattern and the expected behavior.\n\n"
