It checks if any pixel within the corresponding 3x3 area in the *output grid* has already been changed to blue (1) by a previous step (indicating an overlap with a higher-priority square).\n2. If the input 3x3 subgrid is all white AND the corresponding output 3x3 area contains NO blue pixels, then the 3x3 area in the output grid is filled with blue (1) pixels.\nOtherwise, the area is left unchanged. Pixels outside of any transformed 3x3 area remain identical to the input grid. This process ensures that in cases of overlapping 3x3 white squares in the input, only the one encountered first during the scan (top-most, then left-most) gets transformed.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies 3x3 blocks of white (0) pixels in the input grid.
