Okay, let's break down the transformation in this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct, non-white objects scattered across a white background. Additionally, in the bottom-left corner, there are pairs of vertically adjacent colored pixels (e.g., green above blue, yellow above red in `train_1`; azure above green, blue above red in `train_2`). These pairs appear separate from the main objects.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the original non-white objects in their exact positions and colors. However, the areas *around* these objects, specifically within their bounding boxes, are filled with new colors. The white background outside these filled bounding boxes remains white.
3.  **Transformation Clues:** The corner pixel pairs seem to act as a legend or key. The top color in a pair corresponds to the color of an object type found elsewhere in the grid. The bottom color in the pair corresponds to the color used to fill the background *within the bounding box* of objects of that type.
4.  **Object Identification:** The task involves identifying distinct objects (contiguous blocks of the same non-white color).
5.  **Bounding Box:** For each identified object, its minimal bounding box seems important.
6.  **Filling Logic:** The transformation fills the white pixels (0) *only* within the bounding box of each identified object. The fill color is determined by the mapping provided by the corner pixel pairs. The original object pixels are not changed.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels.
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Default background color.
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous blocks of a single non-white color. Multiple objects of potentially different colors can exist in the input.
    properties:
      - color: Non-white (1-9)
      - shape: Varies (e.g., '3' shape, 'H' shape, 'cross' shape)
      - location: Scattered across the grid.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing the object.
  - type: marker_pair
    description: Vertically adjacent non-white pixels located in the bottom-left corner of the input grid. Each pair defines a color mapping.
    properties:
      - top_pixel_color: Represents the color of an object type present in the grid.
      - bottom_pixel_color: Represents the target fill color for the background within the bounding box of objects with the top_pixel_color.
      - location: Fixed area, typically columns 0-1, rows near the bottom.

actions:
  - name: identify_marker_pairs
    description: Locate the vertical color pairs in the bottom-left corner of the input grid.
  - name: create_color_map
    description: Build a mapping where the top color of each marker pair maps to its corresponding bottom color.
  - name: identify_objects
    description: Find all distinct, contiguous non-white objects in the input grid.
  - name: determine_bounding_box
    description: For each identified object, calculate its minimal bounding box (min/max row and column).
  - name: fill_background_in_box
    description: For each object, iterate through all pixels within its bounding box. If a pixel is white (0) in the input grid, change its color in the output grid to the target fill color associated with the object's original color (using the map derived from the markers).
  - name: preserve_objects
    description: Ensure that the original non-white pixels of the objects remain unchanged in the output grid.

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    description: The marker pairs establish a direct mapping between an object's color and the color used to fill the background within its bounding box.
  - type: containment
    description: The fill action is constrained to occur only within the bounding box of each identified object.

output_goal:
  - description: Modify the input grid by filling the white background pixels within the bounding box of each object, using the color specified by the marker pairs corresponding to the object's color. Original object pixels must be preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  **Identify Color Mapping:** Scan the bottom-left corner (specifically columns 0 and 1, checking rows from bottom to top) of the *input* grid to find vertical pairs of non-white pixels. For each pair found, store a mapping where the color of the top pixel maps to the color of the bottom pixel.
3.  **Identify Objects and Bounding Boxes:** Find all distinct objects (contiguous areas of the same non-white color) in the *input* grid. For each object:
    *   Determine its color.
    *   Calculate its minimal bounding box (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column).
4.  **Apply Fill:** For each identified object:
    *   Retrieve the target fill color using the object's color and the mapping created in step 2.
    *   Iterate through every grid cell within the object's bounding box (from minimum row to maximum row, and minimum column to maximum column).
    *   For each cell within the bounding box, check its color in the *original input* grid.
    *   If the cell's color in the *input* grid is white (0), change the color of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to the target fill color.
    *   If the cell's color in the *input* grid is not white, leave the corresponding cell in the *output* grid unchanged (preserving the original object).
5.  **Return Output:** The modified grid is the final output.
