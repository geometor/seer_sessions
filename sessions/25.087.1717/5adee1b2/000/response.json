            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation in this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct, non-white objects scattered across a white background. Additionally, in the bottom-left corner, there are pairs of vertically adjacent colored pixels (e.g., green above blue, yellow above red in `train_1`; azure above green, blue above red in `train_2`). These pairs appear separate from the main objects.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the original non-white objects in their exact positions and colors. However, the areas *around* these objects, specifically within their bounding boxes, are filled with new colors. The white background outside these filled bounding boxes remains white.\n3.  **Transformation Clues:** The corner pixel pairs seem to act as a legend or key. The top color in a pair corresponds to the color of an object type found elsewhere in the grid. The bottom color in the pair corresponds to the color used to fill the background *within the bounding box* of objects of that type.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The task involves identifying distinct objects (contiguous blocks of the same non-white color).\n5.  **Bounding Box:** For each identified object, its minimal bounding box seems important.\n6.  **Filling Logic:** The transformation fills the white pixels (0) *only* within the bounding box of each identified object. The fill color is determined by the mapping provided by the corner pixel pairs. The original object pixels are not changed.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
