elements:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels.
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Default background color.
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous blocks of a single non-white color. Multiple objects of potentially different colors can exist in the input.
    properties:
      - color: Non-white (1-9)
      - shape: Varies (e.g., '3' shape, 'H' shape, 'cross' shape)
      - location: Scattered across the grid.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing the object.
  - type: marker_pair
    description: Vertically adjacent non-white pixels located in the bottom-left corner of the input grid. Each pair defines a color mapping.
    properties:
      - top_pixel_color: Represents the color of an object type present in the grid.
      - bottom_pixel_color: Represents the target fill color for the background within the bounding box of objects with the top_pixel_color.
      - location: Fixed area, typically columns 0-1, rows near the bottom.

actions:
  - name: identify_marker_pairs
    description: Locate the vertical color pairs in the bottom-left corner of the input grid.
  - name: create_color_map
    description: Build a mapping where the top color of each marker pair maps to its corresponding bottom color.
  - name: identify_objects
    description: Find all distinct, contiguous non-white objects in the input grid.
  - name: determine_bounding_box
    description: For each identified object, calculate its minimal bounding box (min/max row and column).
  - name: fill_background_in_box
    description: For each object, iterate through all pixels within its bounding box. If a pixel is white (0) in the input grid, change its color in the output grid to the target fill color associated with the object's original color (using the map derived from the markers).
  - name: preserve_objects
    description: Ensure that the original non-white pixels of the objects remain unchanged in the output grid.

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    description: The marker pairs establish a direct mapping between an object's color and the color used to fill the background within its bounding box.
  - type: containment
    description: The fill action is constrained to occur only within the bounding box of each identified object.

output_goal:
  - description: Modify the input grid by filling the white background pixels within the bounding box of each object, using the color specified by the marker pairs corresponding to the object's color. Original object pixels must be preserved.
