            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding of the transformation.\n\n**1. General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code attempted to identify objects, find marker pairs (interpreted as vertical pairs in the bottom-left) to create a color map, calculate bounding boxes for each object, and fill the white background within those boxes using the mapped color.\n\nThe results show this logic failed significantly on both examples. The transformed outputs did not match the expected outputs. Key issues observed:\n\n*   **Incorrect Color Mapping:** The transformed output suggests the code incorrectly determined the fill colors. Instead of using the color indicated by the markers, it seems to have used the object's own color for filling, likely due to an incorrect interpretation of the marker pairs. The previous code's `find_marker_pairs` function identified `3->3` and `4->4` in Example 1, and `8->8`, `1->1` in Example 2, based on its flawed logic.\n*   **Filling Logic:** Although the code intended to fill only white pixels within the bounding box, the visual difference between transformed and expected outputs is stark, primarily driven by the incorrect fill color.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Re-examine the marker pair definition. The consistent structure in the bottom-left corner across examples (e.g., `3 1` / `3 1` and `4 2` / `4 2` in Ex1; `8 3` / `8 3` and `1 2` / `1 2` in Ex2) strongly suggests a *horizontal* relationship defines the mapping. The color in column `c` likely maps to the color in column `c+1` within these marker blocks.\n2.  Verify this new marker logic against both examples.\n3.  Confirm the object identification, bounding box calculation, and background filling (only white pixels) logic remain appropriate once the correct color map is derived.\n4.  Update the facts and natural language program accordingly.\n\n**2. Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's use code execution to analyze the examples with the revised marker logic hypothesis (horizontal pairs in the first two columns, bottom-up).\n\n"
