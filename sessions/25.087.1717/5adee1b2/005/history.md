"""
Identifies distinct non-white objects in the input grid.
Determines a color mapping from special marker pairs (horizontal non-white pixels) 
typically found in the bottom-left corner (columns 0 and 1): the color in column 0
maps to the color in column 1.
For each object found:
  Calculates its minimal bounding box.
  Finds the target fill color using the object's color and the derived color mapping.
  Fills all white (0) pixels within the object's minimal bounding box in the 
  output grid with the target fill color.
  Preserves the original non-white pixels of the object.
The background outside any object's bounding box remains white. Pixels belonging
to objects whose color does not appear as a key in the marker pairs are left
untouched, and their bounding boxes are not filled.

## General Assessment

The previous code successfully identified the marker pairs in the bottom-left corner to establish a color mapping and correctly identified the distinct non-white objects in the input grid. However, the transformed outputs deviate significantly from the expected outputs. The core issue lies in the interpretation of how the bounding box of each object should be filled. The previous code filled only the *white* (0) background pixels within the bounding box, preserving the original object pixels. The expected outputs indicate a different filling strategy: the *entire* area of the minimal bounding box should be filled with the target color derived from the marker map, and *then* the original non-white pixels of the object should be restored (overwritten) onto this filled rectangle.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to modify the filling logic:
1.  Identify the object and its color.
2.  Find the corresponding target fill color using the marker map.
3.  Determine the minimal bounding box of the object.
4.  Fill the entire rectangular area defined by the bounding box with the target fill color.
5.  Iterate through the original pixels of the object and overwrite the corresponding pixels within the filled bounding box with the object's original color.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze the examples provided:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** Contains green (3) and yellow (4) objects.
*   **Marker Pairs:** (3, 1) and (4, 2) located in rows 15-19, columns 0-1.
*   **Color Map Derived:** {3: 1 (blue), 4: 2 (red)}
*   **Objects:**
    *   Object 1: Green (3), BBox approx. (rows 2-6, cols 3-7)
    *   Object 2: Yellow (4), BBox approx. (rows 2-6, cols 12-16)
    *   Object 3: Yellow (4), BBox approx. (rows 11-15, cols 8-12)
*   **Expected Output Behavior:**
    *   Object 1 BBox is filled entirely with blue (1), then original green (3) pixels are restored.
    *   Object 2 BBox is filled entirely with red (2), then original yellow (4) pixels are restored.
    *   Object 3 BBox is filled entirely with red (2), then original yellow (4) pixels are restored.
*   **Previous Code Behavior:** Filled only white (0) pixels within each BBox with the mapped color (1 or 2). This resulted in the original object pixels surrounded by the mapped color, but other non-white background pixels within the BBox (if any existed, though not in this specific example's input) would have been preserved, and the overall filled area was smaller than the full BBox rectangle shown in the expected output.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** Contains azure (8) and blue (1) objects.
*   **Marker Pairs:** (8, 3) and (1, 2) located in rows 15-19, columns 0-1.
*   **Color Map Derived:** {8: 3 (green), 1: 2 (red)}
*   **Objects:**
    *   Object 1: Azure (8), BBox approx. (rows 1-6, cols 3-7)
    *   Object 2: Azure (8), BBox approx. (rows 1-5, cols 12-16)
    *   Object 3: Blue (1), BBox approx. (rows 8-12, cols 10-14)
    *   Object 4: Blue (1), BBox approx. (rows 15-19, cols 7-11)
*   **Expected Output Behavior:**
    *   Object 1 BBox is filled entirely with green (3), then original azure (8) pixels are restored.
    *   Object 2 BBox is filled entirely with green (3), then original azure (8) pixels are restored.
    *   Object 3 BBox is filled entirely with red (2), then original blue (1) pixels are restored.
    *   Object 4 BBox is filled entirely with red (2), then original blue (1) pixels are restored.
*   **Previous Code Behavior:** Filled only white (0) pixels within each BBox with the mapped color (3 or 2). Again, this doesn't match the expected output where the entire rectangular BBox area is filled first.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_name: c5c7b716
description: Fill the bounding box of each identified object with a color determined by a mapping found in the bottom-left corner, then restore the original object pixels.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  background_color: 0 (white)
  max_size: 30x30

components:
  - role: marker_pairs
    location: bottom-left corner (typically columns 0 and 1, searching bottom-up)
    structure: horizontal pairs of non-white pixels (color_A, color_B)
    properties: defines a color mapping rule: color_A maps to color_B. Only the first occurrence of color_A (from bottom) defines the mapping.
    action: read these pairs to create a dictionary `color_map = {color_A: color_B, ...}`.

  - role: objects
    identification: contiguous areas of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: the specific non-white color of the object's pixels.
      - shape: the specific arrangement of the object's pixels.
      - location: the set of coordinates occupied by the object's pixels.
      - minimal_bounding_box: the smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of the object.
    action: identify all distinct objects in the input grid.

transformation:
  condition: applies only to objects whose color exists as a key in the `color_map` derived from the marker pairs.
  steps:
    - Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    - Identify marker pairs and create the `color_map`.
    - Find all distinct non-white objects.
    - For each identified object:
      - Get the object's color (`object_color`).
      - Check if `object_color` is in `color_map`.
      - If yes:
        - Get the target fill color: `fill_color = color_map[object_color]`.
        - Calculate the object's minimal bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
        - Fill the entire rectangular region in the output grid defined by the bounding box coordinates with `fill_color`.
        - Iterate through all pixels belonging to the original object. For each pixel at (r, c) with `object_color` in the input grid, set the output grid pixel at (r, c) back to `object_color`.
      - If no: leave the object and its surrounding area unchanged from the initial copy.
  output: the modified grid after processing all applicable objects.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  **Find Color Map:** Scan the input grid starting from the bottom row upwards, specifically looking at columns 0 and 1. For each row, if both `grid[row, 0]` and `grid[row, 1]` are non-white colors (not 0), record a mapping rule: the color at `grid[row, 0]` maps to the color at `grid[row, 1]`. Store these mappings (e.g., in a dictionary). If a color from column 0 already has a mapping, ignore subsequent pairs involving that same color (prioritize the lowest row).
3.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct connected areas (objects) of non-white pixels in the input grid. For each object, record its color and the set of coordinates it occupies.
4.  **Process Each Object:** Iterate through each identified object.
    a.  Let the object's color be `object_color`. Check if this `object_color` exists as a key in the color map created in step 2.
    b.  **If a mapping exists:**
        i.  Determine the target fill color (`fill_color`) using the map: `fill_color = map[object_color]`.
        ii. Calculate the minimal bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing all the object's pixels) defined by its minimum and maximum row and column coordinates.
        iii. In the **output grid**, fill the entire rectangular area defined by the bounding box with the `fill_color`.
        iv. Iterate through the original coordinates of the object's pixels found in step 3. For each original pixel coordinate `(r, c)` belonging to this object, set the pixel at `output_grid[r, c]` back to the `object_color`.
    c.  **If no mapping exists:** Do nothing further for this object; its pixels remain as they were in the initial copy of the input grid.
5.  **Finalize:** The resulting output grid contains the filled bounding boxes overlaid with the original objects for all mapped colors.
