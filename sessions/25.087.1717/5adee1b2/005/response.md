"""
Fill the bounding box of each identified object with a color determined by a 
mapping found in the bottom-left corner, then restore the original object pixels.

1. **Find Color Map:** Scan the input grid starting from the bottom row upwards, 
   specifically looking at columns 0 and 1. For each row, if both grid[row, 0] 
   and grid[row, 1] are non-white colors (not 0), record a mapping rule: the 
   color at grid[row, 0] maps to the color at grid[row, 1]. Store these 
   mappings (e.g., in a dictionary). If a color from column 0 already has a 
   mapping, ignore subsequent pairs involving that same color (prioritize the 
   lowest row).
2. **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct connected areas (objects) of non-white 
   pixels in the input grid using Breadth-First Search (BFS). For each object, 
   record its color and the set of coordinates it occupies.
3. **Process Each Object:** Iterate through each identified object.
   a. Let the object's color be `object_color`. Check if this `object_color` 
      exists as a key in the color map created in step 1.
   b. **If a mapping exists:**
      i. Determine the target fill color (`fill_color`) using the map: 
         `fill_color = map[object_color]`.
     ii. Calculate the minimal bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing 
         all the object's pixels) defined by its minimum and maximum row and 
         column coordinates.
    iii. In the **output grid**, fill the entire rectangular area defined by the 
         bounding box with the `fill_color`.
     iv. Iterate through the original coordinates of the object's pixels found 
         in step 2. For each original pixel coordinate (r, c) belonging to 
         this object, set the pixel at `output_grid[r, c]` back to the 
         `object_color`.
   c. **If no mapping exists:** Do nothing further for this object; its pixels 
      remain as they were in the initial copy of the input grid.
4. **Finalize:** The resulting output grid contains the filled bounding boxes 
   overlaid with the original objects for all mapped colors.
