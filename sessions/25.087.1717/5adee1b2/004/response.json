            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully identified the marker pairs in the bottom-left corner to establish a color mapping and correctly identified the distinct non-white objects in the input grid. However, the transformed outputs deviate significantly from the expected outputs. The core issue lies in the interpretation of how the bounding box of each object should be filled. The previous code filled only the *white* (0) background pixels within the bounding box, preserving the original object pixels. The expected outputs indicate a different filling strategy: the *entire* area of the minimal bounding box should be filled with the target color derived from the marker map, and *then* the original non-white pixels of the object should be restored (overwritten) onto this filled rectangle.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is to modify the filling logic:\n1.  Identify the object and its color.\n2.  Find the corresponding target fill color using the marker map.\n3.  Determine the minimal bounding box of the object.\n4.  Fill the entire rectangular area defined by the bounding box with the target fill color.\n5.  Iterate through the original pixels of the object and overwrite the corresponding pixels within the filled bounding box with the object's original color.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the examples provided:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** Contains green (3) and yellow (4) objects.\n*   **Marker Pairs:** (3, 1) and (4, 2) located in rows 15-19, columns 0-1.\n*   **Color Map Derived:** {3: 1 (blue), 4: 2 (red)}\n*   **Objects:**\n    *   Object 1: Green (3), BBox approx. (rows 2-6, cols 3-7)\n    *   Object 2: Yellow (4), BBox approx. (rows 2-6, cols 12-16)\n    *   Object 3: Yellow (4), BBox approx. (rows 11-15, cols 8-12)\n*   **Expected Output Behavior:**\n    *   Object 1 BBox is filled entirely with blue (1), then original green (3) pixels are restored.\n    *   Object 2 BBox is filled entirely with red (2), then original yellow (4) pixels are restored.\n    *   Object 3 BBox is filled entirely with red (2), then original yellow (4) pixels are restored.\n*   **Previous Code Behavior:** Filled only white (0) pixels within each BBox with the mapped color (1 or 2). This resulted in the original object pixels surrounded by the mapped color, but other non-white background pixels within the BBox (if any existed, though not in this specific example's input) would have been preserved, and the overall filled area was smaller than the full BBox rectangle shown in the expected output.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** Contains azure (8) and blue (1) objects.\n*   **Marker Pairs:** (8, 3) and (1, 2) located in rows 15-19, columns 0-1.\n*   **Color Map Derived:** {8: 3 (green), 1: 2 (red)}\n*   **Objects:**\n    *   Object 1: Azure (8), BBox approx. (rows 1-6, cols 3-7)\n    *   Object 2: Azure (8), BBox approx. (rows 1-5, cols 12-16)\n    *   Object 3: Blue (1), BBox approx. (rows 8-12, cols 10-14)\n    *   Object 4: Blue (1), BBox approx. (rows 15-19, cols 7-11)\n*   **Expected Output Behavior:**\n    *   Object 1 BBox is filled entirely with green (3), then original azure (8) pixels are restored.\n    *   Object 2 BBox is filled entirely with green (3), then original azure (8) pixels are restored.\n    *   Object 3 BBox is filled entirely with red (2), then original blue (1) pixels are restored.\n    *   Object 4 BBox is filled entirely with red (2), then original blue (1) pixels are restored.\n*   **Previous Code Behavior:** Filled only white (0) pixels within each BBox with the mapped color (3 or 2). Again, this doesn't match the expected output where the entire rectangular BBox area is filled first.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

For each row, if both `grid[row, 0]` and `grid[row, 1]` are non-white colors (not 0), record a mapping rule: the color at `grid[row, 0]` maps to the color at `grid[row, 1]`. Store these mappings (e.g., in a dictionary). If a color from column 0 already has a mapping, ignore subsequent pairs involving that same color (prioritize the lowest row).\n3.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct connected areas (objects) of non-white pixels in the input grid. For each object, record its color and the set of coordinates it occupies.\n4.  **Process Each Object:** Iterate through each identified object.\n    a.  Let the object's color be `object_color`.
