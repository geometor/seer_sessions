The bounding box detection and marker identification seem correct and match the manual analysis. The revised hypothesis holds across all examples.

Now, structure the response.## General Assessment

The previous code failed because the logic for drawing lines based on marker positions was incorrect. The original hypothesis involved drawing lines *from* the central red rectangle *towards* the markers, spanning the rectangle's height/width. The analysis of the expected outputs reveals a different pattern:

1.  Lines are drawn *along* the row or column of the marker.
2.  Lines extend *from the grid edge* inwards *towards* the red rectangle, stopping at its boundary.
3.  Lines only fill white (0) pixels.
4.  A marker's position relative to the rectangle's bounding box (Above, Below, Left, Right) determines which edge the line extends from and its orientation (vertical or horizontal).
5.  These position checks (Above/Below vs. Left/Right) appear to be independent. A marker located diagonally relative to the rectangle (e.g., Above and Left) might trigger *both* a vertical line segment *and* a horizontal line segment.

The strategy is to implement this revised logic, ensuring that the line drawing correctly handles the boundaries and only modifies white pixels.

## Metrics

Metrics gathered using code execution confirm the initial manual analysis:

**Example 1:**
*   Input Grid Size: 20x15
*   Largest Red Rectangle BBox: `min_r=5`, `max_r=9`, `min_c=4`, `max_c=8`
*   Markers (Green=3):
    *   (1, 4) - Above & Left
    *   (1, 8) - Above & Inside Column Range
    *   (3, 6) - Above & Inside Column Range
    *   (5, 12) - Inside Row Range & Right
    *   (7, 1) - Inside Row Range & Left
    *   (8, 13) - Inside Row Range & Right
    *   (13, 8) - Below & Inside Column Range
    *   (16, 5) - Below & Inside Column Range
*   Previous Code Failure: Incorrect line drawing logic resulted in 83 pixels off.

**Example 2:**
*   Input Grid Size: 21x25
*   Largest Red Rectangle BBox: `min_r=1`, `max_r=8`, `min_c=2`, `max_c=9`
*   Markers (Azure=8):
    *   (1, 21) - Inside Row Range & Right
    *   (2, 19) - Inside Row Range & Right
    *   (4, 15) - Inside Row Range & Right

**Example 3:**
*   Input Grid Size: 20x17
*   Largest Red Rectangle BBox: `min_r=4`, `max_r=9`, `min_c=5`, `max_c=10`
*   Markers (Yellow=4):
    *   (1, 6) - Above & Inside Column Range
    *   (1, 10) - Above & Inside Column Range
    *   (4, 2) - Inside Row Range & Left
    *   (7, 1) - Inside Row Range & Left
    *   (8, 2) - Inside Row Range & Left
    *   (9, 14) - Inside Row Range & Right
    *   (13, 5) - Below & Inside Column Range
    *   (14, 9) - Below & Inside Column Range
*   Previous Code Failure: Incorrect line drawing logic resulted in 97 pixels off.

The consistent failure pattern across examples confirms the need to revise the core line-drawing mechanism based on the marker's position relative to the rectangle's bounding box.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: The task involves drawing red lines onto a white background based on the positions of "marker" pixels relative to the largest solid red rectangle in the input grid.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - object_color: 2 (red)
  - marker_colors: Any color other than white (0) or red (2). Examples use green (3), azure (8), yellow (4).

objects:
  - type: Red Rectangle
    properties:
      - color: 2 (red)
      - shape: Solid rectangle (must be filled, no holes)
      - role: Reference object, defines boundaries for line drawing.
      - selection: The largest connected solid red rectangle by area (pixel count).
      - attributes: Bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
  - type: Marker Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Not white (0) and not red (2)
      - shape: Single pixel
      - role: Control points for initiating line drawing.
      - attributes: Position (row, column).

actions:
  - name: Identify Objects
    steps:
      - Find all connected components of red (2) pixels.
      - Verify each component is a solid rectangle.
      - Select the largest valid red rectangle component.
      - Determine its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
      - Find all pixels that are not white (0) or red (2), designate them as markers.
  - name: Draw Lines from Markers
    condition: For each marker pixel at (marker_row, marker_col):
    steps:
      - Check position relative to the red rectangle's bounding box.
      - If marker_row < min_r (Marker is Above):
          Draw a vertical red (2) line segment in column marker_col.
          The line extends from row 0 up to (but not including) min_r.
          Only change pixels if their current color is white (0).
      - If marker_row > max_r (Marker is Below):
          Draw a vertical red (2) line segment in column marker_col.
          The line extends from row max_r + 1 down to the bottom edge of the grid.
          Only change pixels if their current color is white (0).
      - If marker_col < min_c (Marker is Left):
          Draw a horizontal red (2) line segment in row marker_row.
          The line extends from column 0 up to (but not including) min_c.
          Only change pixels if their current color is white (0).
      - If marker_col > max_c (Marker is Right):
          Draw a horizontal red (2) line segment in row marker_row.
          The line extends from column max_c + 1 across to the right edge of the grid.
          Only change pixels if their current color is white (0).
    notes:
      - The four positional checks (Above, Below, Left, Right) are independent. A single marker can trigger multiple line segments if it meets multiple conditions (e.g., a marker above and to the left of the rectangle).
      - Lines stop at the boundary of the red rectangle; they do not enter or cross it.
      - Lines only overwrite the background color (white). Existing markers or parts of the red rectangle are not overwritten.

output: The final grid is the input grid modified by the drawn red lines. If no valid red rectangle is found, the output is identical to the input.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid. Define the background color as white (0) and the primary object color as red (2).
2.  **Identify Red Rectangle:**
    a. Find all connected components of red pixels in the input grid.
    b. For each component, verify if it forms a solid, filled rectangle.
    c. Select the component that forms the largest solid red rectangle (based on pixel count).
    d. If no such red rectangle is found, return the original input grid unchanged.
    e. Determine the bounding box coordinates of the largest red rectangle: `min_row`, `max_row`, `min_col`, `max_col`.
3.  **Identify Markers:** Find the coordinates (`marker_row`, `marker_col`) of all pixels in the input grid whose color is neither white (0) nor red (2).
4.  **Draw Lines:** Iterate through each identified marker pixel:
    a. Let the marker's position be (`mr`, `mc`).
    b. **Check Above:** If `mr < min_row`, draw a vertical red (2) line segment in the output grid in column `mc` from row 0 up to `min_row - 1`. Only change pixels that are currently white (0).
    c. **Check Below:** If `mr > max_row`, draw a vertical red (2) line segment in the output grid in column `mc` from row `max_row + 1` down to the last row of the grid. Only change pixels that are currently white (0).
    d. **Check Left:** If `mc < min_col`, draw a horizontal red (2) line segment in the output grid in row `mr` from column 0 up to `min_col - 1`. Only change pixels that are currently white (0).
    e. **Check Right:** If `mc > max_col`, draw a horizontal red (2) line segment in the output grid in row `mr` from column `max_col + 1` across to the last column of the grid. Only change pixels that are currently white (0).
    *Note: These four checks (a-d) are performed independently for each marker.*
5.  **Return Output:** Return the modified output grid.
