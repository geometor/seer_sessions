task_description: The task involves drawing red lines onto a white background based on the positions of "marker" pixels relative to the largest solid red rectangle in the input grid.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - object_color: 2 (red)
  - marker_colors: Any color other than white (0) or red (2). Examples use green (3), azure (8), yellow (4).

objects:
  - type: Red Rectangle
    properties:
      - color: 2 (red)
      - shape: Solid rectangle (must be filled, no holes)
      - role: Reference object, defines boundaries for line drawing.
      - selection: The largest connected solid red rectangle by area (pixel count).
      - attributes: Bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
  - type: Marker Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Not white (0) and not red (2)
      - shape: Single pixel
      - role: Control points for initiating line drawing.
      - attributes: Position (row, column).

actions:
  - name: Identify Objects
    steps:
      - Find all connected components of red (2) pixels.
      - Verify each component is a solid rectangle.
      - Select the largest valid red rectangle component.
      - Determine its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
      - Find all pixels that are not white (0) or red (2), designate them as markers.
  - name: Draw Lines from Markers
    condition: For each marker pixel at (marker_row, marker_col):
    steps:
      - Check position relative to the red rectangle's bounding box.
      - If marker_row < min_r (Marker is Above):
          Draw a vertical red (2) line segment in column marker_col.
          The line extends from row 0 up to (but not including) min_r.
          Only change pixels if their current color is white (0).
      - If marker_row > max_r (Marker is Below):
          Draw a vertical red (2) line segment in column marker_col.
          The line extends from row max_r + 1 down to the bottom edge of the grid.
          Only change pixels if their current color is white (0).
      - If marker_col < min_c (Marker is Left):
          Draw a horizontal red (2) line segment in row marker_row.
          The line extends from column 0 up to (but not including) min_c.
          Only change pixels if their current color is white (0).
      - If marker_col > max_c (Marker is Right):
          Draw a horizontal red (2) line segment in row marker_row.
          The line extends from column max_c + 1 across to the right edge of the grid.
          Only change pixels if their current color is white (0).
    notes:
      - The four positional checks (Above, Below, Left, Right) are independent. A single marker can trigger multiple line segments if it meets multiple conditions (e.g., a marker above and to the left of the rectangle).
      - Lines stop at the boundary of the red rectangle; they do not enter or cross it.
      - Lines only overwrite the background color (white). Existing markers or parts of the red rectangle are not overwritten.

output: The final grid is the input grid modified by the drawn red lines. If no valid red rectangle is found, the output is identical to the input.
