            "text": "The bounding box detection and marker identification seem correct and match the manual analysis. The revised hypothesis holds across all examples.\n\nNow, structure the response.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because the logic for drawing lines based on marker positions was incorrect. The original hypothesis involved drawing lines *from* the central red rectangle *towards* the markers, spanning the rectangle's height/width. The analysis of the expected outputs reveals a different pattern:\n\n1.  Lines are drawn *along* the row or column of the marker.\n2.  Lines extend *from the grid edge* inwards *towards* the red rectangle, stopping at its boundary.\n3.  Lines only fill white (0) pixels.\n4.  A marker's position relative to the rectangle's bounding box (Above, Below, Left, Right) determines which edge the line extends from and its orientation (vertical or horizontal).\n5.  These position checks (Above/Below vs. Left/Right) appear to be independent. A marker located diagonally relative to the rectangle (e.g., Above and Left) might trigger *both* a vertical line segment *and* a horizontal line segment.\n\nThe strategy is to implement this revised logic, ensuring that the line drawing correctly handles the boundaries and only modifies white pixels.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics gathered using code execution confirm the initial manual analysis:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 20x15\n*   Largest Red Rectangle BBox: `min_r=5`, `max_r=9`, `min_c=4`, `max_c=8`\n*   Markers (Green=3):\n    *   (1, 4) - Above & Left\n    *   (1, 8) - Above & Inside Column Range\n    *   (3, 6) - Above & Inside Column Range\n    *   (5, 12) - Inside Row Range & Right\n    *   (7, 1) - Inside Row Range & Left\n    *   (8, 13) - Inside Row Range & Right\n    *   (13, 8) - Below & Inside Column Range\n    *   (16, 5) - Below & Inside Column Range\n*   Previous Code Failure: Incorrect line drawing logic resulted in 83 pixels off.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 21x25\n*   Largest Red Rectangle BBox: `min_r=1`, `max_r=8`, `min_c=2`, `max_c=9`\n*   Markers (Azure=8):\n    *   (1, 21) - Inside Row Range & Right\n    *   (2, 19) - Inside Row Range & Right\n    *   (4, 15) - Inside Row Range & Right\n    *   (7, 18) - Inside Row Range & Right\n    *   (12, 3) - Below & Inside Column Range\n    *   (13, 9) - Below & Inside Column Range\n    *   (15, 5) - Below & Inside Column Range\n    *   (17, 8) - Below & Inside Column Range\n*   Previous Code Failure: Incorrect line drawing logic resulted in 172 pixels off.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 20x17\n*   Largest Red Rectangle BBox: `min_r=4`, `max_r=9`, `min_c=5`, `max_c=10`\n*   Markers (Yellow=4):\n    *   (1, 6) - Above & Inside Column Range\n    *   (1, 10) - Above & Inside Column Range\n    *   (4, 2) - Inside Row Range & Left\n    *   (7, 1) - Inside Row Range & Left\n    *   (8, 2) - Inside Row Range & Left\n    *   (9, 14) - Inside Row Range & Right\n    *   (13, 5) - Below & Inside Column Range\n    *   (14, 9) - Below & Inside Column Range\n*   Previous Code Failure: Incorrect line drawing logic resulted in 97 pixels off.\n\nThe consistent failure pattern across examples confirms the need to revise the core line-drawing mechanism based on the marker's position relative to the rectangle's bounding box.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
