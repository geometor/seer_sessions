Context:
  Grid: Represents a 2D space.
  Colors: White (0) is background. Red (2) forms the main object. Green (3), Azure (8), Yellow (4) act as markers.

Input_Objects:
  - Type: Background
    Color: White (0)
  - Type: Rectangle
    Color: Red (2)
    Property: Largest connected component of Red pixels. Assumed to be rectangular.
    Attributes:
      - Bounding_Box: (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
      - Internal_Rows_Near_Edge: min_row + 1, max_row - 1
      - Internal_Cols_Near_Edge: min_col + 1, max_col - 1
  - Type: Markers
    Color: Any non-White, non-Red pixel (e.g., Green, Azure, Yellow)
    Property: Usually single pixels.
    Attributes:
      - Position: (row, col)
      - Relative_Position: Location (Above, Below, Left, Right) with respect to the Red Rectangle's bounding box.

Output_Objects:
  - Type: All Input_Objects (preserved)
  - Type: Added_Fill
    Color: Red (2)
    Property: Forms horizontal or vertical lines.
    Generation: Triggered by Markers based on their Relative_Position to the Red Rectangle.

Relationships_Actions:
  - Action: Find the largest connected Red (2) component (the Rectangle).
  - Action: Calculate the Rectangle's Bounding_Box.
  - Action: Identify all Marker pixels and their Positions.
  - Action: For each Marker:
      - Determine its Relative_Position to the Rectangle.
      - If Above: Add vertical Red lines in columns (Internal_Cols_Near_Edge) extending from the top grid edge (row 0) down to the row just above the Rectangle (min_row - 1).
      - If Below: Add vertical Red lines in columns (Internal_Cols_Near_Edge) extending from the row just below the Rectangle (max_row + 1) down to the bottom grid edge.
      - If Left: Add horizontal Red lines in rows (Internal_Rows_Near_Edge) extending from the left grid edge (col 0) across to the column just left of the Rectangle (min_col - 1).
      - If Right: Add horizontal Red lines in rows (Internal_Rows_Near_Edge) extending from the column just right of the Rectangle (max_col + 1) across to the right grid edge.
  - Constraint: Assumes Rectangle width and height are at least 3 pixels for distinct Internal_Rows/Cols_Near_Edge.
  - Constraint: Added Red pixels overwrite existing White pixels but do not change the Rectangle or Markers.
