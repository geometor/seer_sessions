            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Composition:** The input grids consist of a white background (0), a single prominent, solid red (2) rectangular object, and several scattered single pixels of other colors (green (3), azure (8), or yellow (4)). These single pixels act as \"markers\".\n2.  **Output Grid Composition:** The output grids retain all the elements from the input grid in their original positions (the red rectangle and the marker pixels). Additionally, new red (2) pixels are added.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The added red pixels form straight lines (rows or columns) that connect the regions around the marker pixels to the central red rectangle.\n4.  **Line Generation Logic:**\n    *   The lines appear to be generated based on the position of each marker pixel relative to the main red rectangle.\n    *   If a marker is above or below the rectangle, vertical red lines are drawn.\n    *   If a marker is to the left or right of the rectangle, horizontal red lines are drawn.\n    *   The specific rows/columns chosen for these lines seem related to the *internal* structure of the red rectangle, specifically the rows/columns just inside its top/bottom and left/right edges.\n    *   These lines extend from the edge of the grid towards the boundary of the red rectangle.\n5.  **Object Identification:** The core of the task involves identifying the largest red rectangle and the positions of all marker pixels.\n6.  **Coordinate System:** The transformation relies heavily on the row and column coordinates of the rectangle's boundaries and the marker pixels.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
