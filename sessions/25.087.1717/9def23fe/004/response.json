            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code attempts to implement a transformation rule based on identifying a central red rectangle and non-white/non-red \"marker\" pixels. Red lines are drawn extending from the rectangle's boundaries towards the markers. However, the results show significant discrepancies between the transformed output and the expected output for all three training examples.\n\nThe primary issue seems to be the logic for drawing horizontal lines for markers located to the left or right of the red rectangle. The current code draws these lines only on two specific internal rows (`min_row + 1` and `max_row - 1`). The expected outputs, however, show horizontal lines being drawn on *all* rows spanned by the original red rectangle's height (from `min_row` to `max_row`). The logic for vertical lines (for markers above or below) appears largely correct, extending vertically in the marker's column up to the rectangle's horizontal boundary.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the natural language program and subsequent code to correctly implement the drawing of horizontal lines across the full height of the identified red rectangle's original position.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's verify the red rectangle's bounding box and marker positions for each example.\n\n**Example 1:**\n"
