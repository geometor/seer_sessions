**General Assessment**

The provided code attempts to implement a transformation rule based on identifying a central red rectangle and non-white/non-red "marker" pixels. Red lines are drawn extending from the rectangle's boundaries towards the markers. However, the results show significant discrepancies between the transformed output and the expected output for all three training examples.

The primary issue seems to be the logic for drawing horizontal lines for markers located to the left or right of the red rectangle. The current code draws these lines only on two specific internal rows (`min_row + 1` and `max_row - 1`). The expected outputs, however, show horizontal lines being drawn on *all* rows spanned by the original red rectangle's height (from `min_row` to `max_row`). The logic for vertical lines (for markers above or below) appears largely correct, extending vertically in the marker's column up to the rectangle's horizontal boundary.

The strategy is to revise the natural language program and subsequent code to correctly implement the drawing of horizontal lines across the full height of the identified red rectangle's original position.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's verify the red rectangle's bounding box and marker positions for each example.

The metrics confirm the identification of the red rectangle and markers in each example. The bounding boxes are correctly identified.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: "Identify the largest connected red (2) rectangular object and any 'marker' pixels (non-white (0), non-red (2)). Draw red lines extending from the rectangle's boundaries towards the markers. Vertical lines extend from markers above/below the rectangle. Horizontal lines extend from markers left/right of the rectangle."

objects:
  - type: grid
    description: The input and output are 2D arrays of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - type: rectangle
    color: red (2)
    property: largest connected rectangular block of red pixels.
    role: central reference object.
    attributes:
      - bounding_box: (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
  - type: marker
    color: any color except white (0) and red (2)
    property: single pixel locations.
    role: triggers for drawing lines.
    attributes:
      - position: (row, col)
      - relative_position: (Above, Below, Left, Right) relative to the red rectangle's bounding box.
  - type: line
    color: red (2)
    role: drawn elements in the output grid.
    property: can be vertical or horizontal.

actions:
  - action: find_largest_red_rectangle
    input: input grid
    output: bounding box (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c) of the largest red rectangle.
  - action: find_markers
    input: input grid
    output: list of marker positions (row, col) and their colors.
  - action: draw_lines
    input: output grid (copy of input), red rectangle bbox, marker positions
    output: modified output grid
    condition: only draw on white (0) pixels.
    details:
      - if marker is Above (marker_row < min_r):
          draw vertical red line in marker_col from row 0 to min_r - 1.
      - if marker is Below (marker_row > max_r):
          draw vertical red line in marker_col from row max_r + 1 to grid_height - 1.
      - if marker is Left (marker_col < min_c):
          draw horizontal red lines for **each row** `r` from `min_r` to `max_r`, extending from column 0 to min_c - 1.
      - if marker is Right (marker_col > max_c):
          draw horizontal red lines for **each row** `r` from `min_r` to `max_r`, extending from column max_c + 1 to grid_width - 1.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the largest connected red (2) object that forms a solid rectangle in the input grid. Determine its bounding box coordinates: `min_row`, `min_col`, `max_row`, `max_col`. If no such rectangle is found, return the original grid.
3.  Identify all "marker" pixels in the input grid. A marker pixel is any pixel whose color is neither white (0) nor red (2). Record the position (`marker_row`, `marker_col`) of each marker.
4.  Iterate through each identified marker pixel:
    a.  Determine the marker's position relative to the red rectangle's bounding box.
    b.  **If the marker is Above** the rectangle (`marker_row < min_row`):
        Draw a vertical red (2) line in the output grid in column `marker_col`. This line should extend from row 0 down to `min_row - 1`. Only change pixels if their current color is white (0).
    c.  **If the marker is Below** the rectangle (`marker_row > max_row`):
        Draw a vertical red (2) line in the output grid in column `marker_col`. This line should extend from row `max_row + 1` down to the bottom edge of the grid. Only change pixels if their current color is white (0).
    d.  **If the marker is Left** of the rectangle (`marker_col < min_col`):
        For each row `r` from `min_row` to `max_row` (inclusive), draw a horizontal red (2) line in the output grid. This line should be in row `r` and extend from column 0 across to `min_col - 1`. Only change pixels if their current color is white (0).
    e.  **If the marker is Right** of the rectangle (`marker_col > max_col`):
        For each row `r` from `min_row` to `max_row` (inclusive), draw a horizontal red (2) line in the output grid. This line should be in row `r` and extend from column `max_col + 1` across to the right edge of the grid. Only change pixels if their current color is white (0).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
