Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the largest connected red (2) rectangular object in the input grid and determine its bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
2. Calculate the coordinates of two key internal rows (min_row + 1, max_row - 1) and two key internal columns (min_col + 1, max_col - 1) of this rectangle. Assume the rectangle is at least 3x3.
3. Identify all "marker" pixels, which are any pixels that are not white (0) and not red (2).
4. For each marker pixel:
    a. Determine its position relative to the red rectangle (Above, Below, Left, or Right).
    b. If the marker is Above the rectangle, draw vertical red (2) lines in the two key internal columns, extending from the top edge of the grid (row 0) down to the row just above the rectangle (min_row - 1).
    c. If the marker is Below the rectangle, draw vertical red (2) lines in the two key internal columns, extending from the row just below the rectangle (max_row + 1) down to the bottom edge of the grid.
    d. If the marker is Left of the rectangle, draw horizontal red (2) lines in the two key internal rows, extending from the left edge of the grid (col 0) across to the column just left of the rectangle (min_col - 1).
    e. If the marker is Right of the rectangle, draw horizontal red (2) lines in the two key internal rows, extending from the column just right of the rectangle (max_col + 1) across to the right edge of the grid.
5. The output grid is the input grid with these added red lines. Original pixels (markers and the red rectangle) remain unchanged. Added red lines overwrite any background (white 0) pixels in their path.

The code execution confirms the bounding boxes, key internal rows/columns (where applicable), and marker positions relative to the rectangle, aligning with the manual analysis and supporting the **Second Revised Logic Hypothesis**. The detail about only overwriting background pixels is also crucial.

One refinement to the hypothesis/program: In Example 3, the red rectangle is 6x6. BBox (4, 5) to (9, 10). min_row=4, max_row=9, min_col=5, max_col=10. Key internal rows are 5 and 8. Key internal columns are 6 and 9 (not 10 as I wrote in the scratchpad). The code output `Key Internal Columns: 6, 9` is correct. My manual calculation was slightly off there, but the principle holds.

The logic seems solid now. It addresses the specific placement of lines based on marker location and rectangle internal structure, which was the key failure point of the previous attempt.Okay, let's break down the task based on the failed attempt and the examples.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code attempt correctly identified the core components: a central red rectangle and marker pixels of other colors. It also correctly deduced that the markers' positions relative to the rectangle dictate where new red lines are drawn.

However, the previous code failed because it made an incorrect assumption about *where* the red lines should be drawn. It assumed lines should always be drawn along the *internal grid lines* (one pixel inside the border) of the red rectangle, extending outwards.

The actual pattern, revealed by comparing the `Expected Output` and `Transformed Output` across all examples, is more nuanced:

1.  **Vertical Lines (Above/Below Markers):** These lines are drawn in the *same column as the marker*, extending vertically from the grid edge *towards* the rectangle's boundary.
2.  **Horizontal Lines (Left/Right Markers):** These lines are drawn in the *key internal rows* of the rectangle (min\_row + 1 and max\_row - 1), extending horizontally from the grid edge *towards* the rectangle's boundary.
3.  **Overwriting:** The new red lines only overwrite background (white, 0) pixels. Existing pixels (markers, the original red rectangle) are preserved.

The strategy is to implement this refined logic, ensuring the correct rows/columns are used for line drawing based on the marker's relative position and handling the background-only overwriting.

## Metrics Gathering (Code Analysis Output)

The code execution provided the following key details for each example:

**Example 1:**
*   Grid Shape: 20x15
*   Red Rectangle BBox: (5, 4) to (9, 8) [Dimensions: 5x5]
*   Key Internal Rows: 6, 8
*   Markers & Positions:
    *   (1, 4, color 3): Above
    *   (1, 8, color 3): Above
    *   (3, 6, color 3): Above
    *   (5, 12, color 3): Right
    *   (7, 1, color 3): Left
    *   (8, 13, color 3): Right
    *   (13, 8, color 3): Below
    *   (16, 5, color 3): Below

**Example 2:**
*   Grid Shape: 21x25
*   Red Rectangle BBox: (1, 2) to (8, 9) [Dimensions: 8x8]
*   Key Internal Rows: 2, 7
*   Markers & Positions:
    *   (1, 21, color 8): Right
    *   (2, 19, color 8): Right
    *   (4, 15, color 8): Right
    *   (7, 18, color 8): Right
    *   (12, 3, color 8): Below
    *   (13, 9, color 8): Below
    *   (15, 5, color 8): Below
    *   (17, 8, color 8): Below

**Example 3:**
*   Grid Shape: 20x17
*   Red Rectangle BBox: (4, 5) to (9, 10) [Dimensions: 6x6]
*   Key Internal Rows: 5, 8
*   Markers & Positions:
    *   (1, 6, color 4): Above
    *   (1, 10, color 4): Above
    *   (4, 2, color 4): Left
    *   (7, 1, color 4): Left
    *   (8, 2, color 4): Left
    *   (9, 14, color 4): Right
    *   (13, 5, color 4): Below
    *   (14, 9, color 4): Below

This data confirms the object identification (red rectangle, markers) and their relative spatial relationships (Above, Below, Left, Right), which are crucial for the transformation logic. It also confirms the applicability of "key internal rows" as the rectangle is always at least 3x3 in the examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  **Identify Red Rectangle:** Find the largest connected component of red (2) pixels that forms a solid rectangle. Determine its bounding box (min\_row, min\_col, max\_row, max\_col). Assume such a rectangle exists and is at least 3x3.
3.  **Identify Key Rows:** Calculate the two key internal rows of the rectangle: `key_row_top = min_row + 1` and `key_row_bottom = max_row - 1`.
4.  **Identify Markers:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are neither white (0) nor red (2). These are the marker pixels.
5.  **Process Markers and Draw Lines:** Iterate through each marker pixel found:
    *   Get the marker's coordinates: `(marker_row, marker_col)`.
    *   Determine the marker's position relative to the red rectangle's bounding box.
    *   **If the marker is Above** the rectangle (`marker_row < min_row`): Draw a vertical red (2) line in column `marker_col` from row 0 down to `min_row - 1`. Only change pixels in the output grid if they are currently white (0).
    *   **If the marker is Below** the rectangle (`marker_row > max_row`): Draw a vertical red (2) line in column `marker_col` from row `max_row + 1` down to the bottom edge of the grid. Only change pixels in the output grid if they are currently white (0).
    *   **If the marker is Left** of the rectangle (`marker_col < min_col`): Draw two horizontal red (2) lines, one in row `key_row_top` and one in row `key_row_bottom`, both extending from column 0 across to `min_col - 1`. Only change pixels in the output grid if they are currently white (0).
    *   **If the marker is Right** of the rectangle (`marker_col > max_col`): Draw two horizontal red (2) lines, one in row `key_row_top` and one in row `key_row_bottom`, both extending from column `max_col + 1` across to the right edge of the grid. Only change pixels in the output grid if they are currently white (0).
6.  **Return Output:** The final modified grid is the result.
