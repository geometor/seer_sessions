            "text": "The code execution confirms the bounding boxes, key internal rows/columns (where applicable), and marker positions relative to the rectangle, aligning with the manual analysis and supporting the **Second Revised Logic Hypothesis**. The detail about only overwriting background pixels is also crucial.\n\nOne refinement to the hypothesis/program: In Example 3, the red rectangle is 6x6. BBox (4, 5) to (9, 10). min_row=4, max_row=9, min_col=5, max_col=10. Key internal rows are 5 and 8. Key internal columns are 6 and 9 (not 10 as I wrote in the scratchpad). The code output `Key Internal Columns: 6, 9` is correct. My manual calculation was slightly off there, but the principle holds.\n\nThe logic seems solid now. It addresses the specific placement of lines based on marker location and rectangle internal structure, which was the key failure point of the previous attempt.Okay, let's break down the task based on the failed attempt and the examples.\n\n## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code attempt correctly identified the core components: a central red rectangle and marker pixels of other colors. It also correctly deduced that the markers' positions relative to the rectangle dictate where new red lines are drawn.\n\nHowever, the previous code failed because it made an incorrect assumption about *where* the red lines should be drawn. It assumed lines should always be drawn along the *internal grid lines* (one pixel inside the border) of the red rectangle, extending outwards.\n\nThe actual pattern, revealed by comparing the `Expected Output` and `Transformed Output` across all examples, is more nuanced:\n\n1.  **Vertical Lines (Above/Below Markers):** These lines are drawn in the *same column as the marker*, extending vertically from the grid edge *towards* the rectangle's boundary.\n2.  **Horizontal Lines (Left/Right Markers):** These lines are drawn in the *key internal rows* of the rectangle (min\\_row + 1 and max\\_row - 1), extending horizontally from the grid edge *towards* the rectangle's boundary.\n3.  **Overwriting:** The new red lines only overwrite background (white, 0) pixels. Existing pixels (markers, the original red rectangle) are preserved.\n\nThe strategy is to implement this refined logic, ensuring the correct rows/columns are used for line drawing based on the marker's relative position and handling the background-only overwriting.\n\n## Metrics Gathering (Code Analysis Output)\n\nThe code execution provided the following key details for each example:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Grid Shape: 20x15\n*   Red Rectangle BBox: (5, 4) to (9, 8) [Dimensions: 5x5]\n*   Key Internal Rows: 6, 8\n*   Markers & Positions:\n    *   (1, 4, color 3): Above\n    *   (1, 8, color 3): Above\n    *   (3, 6, color 3): Above\n    *   (5, 12, color 3): Right\n    *   (7, 1, color 3): Left\n    *   (8, 13, color 3): Right\n    *   (13, 8, color 3): Below\n    *   (16, 5, color 3): Below\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Grid Shape: 21x25\n*   Red Rectangle BBox: (1, 2) to (8, 9) [Dimensions: 8x8]\n*   Key Internal Rows: 2, 7\n*   Markers & Positions:\n    *   (1, 21, color 8): Right\n    *   (2, 19, color 8): Right\n    *   (4, 15, color 8): Right\n    *   (7, 18, color 8): Right\n    *   (12, 3, color 8): Below\n    *   (13, 9, color 8): Below\n    *   (15, 5, color 8): Below\n    *   (17, 8, color 8): Below\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Grid Shape: 20x17\n*   Red Rectangle BBox: (4, 5) to (9, 10) [Dimensions: 6x6]\n*   Key Internal Rows: 5, 8\n*   Markers & Positions:\n    *   (1, 6, color 4): Above\n    *   (1, 10, color 4): Above\n    *   (4, 2, color 4): Left\n    *   (7, 1, color 4): Left\n    *   (8, 2, color 4): Left\n    *   (9, 14, color 4): Right\n    *   (13, 5, color 4): Below\n    *   (14, 9, color 4): Below\n\nThis data confirms the object identification (red rectangle, markers) and their relative spatial relationships (Above, Below, Left, Right), which are crucial for the transformation logic. It also confirms the applicability of \"key internal rows\" as the rectangle is always at least 3x3 in the examples.\n\n## YAML Fact Documentation\n\n"
