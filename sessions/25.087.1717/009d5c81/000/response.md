Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Background:** The grids consistently use white (0) as the background color, which remains unchanged in the output.
2.  **Input Objects:** Each input grid contains exactly two distinct non-background objects:
    *   An object composed of azure (8) pixels, located generally in the upper part of the grid. Its shape varies across examples.
    *   An object composed of blue (1) pixels, located generally in the lower part of the grid. Its shape also varies.
3.  **Output Objects:** Each output grid contains only *one* non-background object.
    *   This object occupies the exact same position and has the exact same shape as the *azure* object from the input.
    *   The color of this object in the output is *not* azure (8). It changes based on the input.
    *   The *blue* object from the input is completely absent in the output (replaced by the white background).
4.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation involves removing the blue object and recoloring the azure object. The key is determining the rule for the new color.
5.  **Color Rule Clue:** The color change applied to the azure object seems dependent on properties of the *removed* blue object. Let's examine the blue objects and the resulting colors:
    *   Example 1: Blue object has 6 pixels, contains one internal hole -> Azure becomes Orange (7).
    *   Example 2: Blue object has 6 pixels, no internal holes -> Azure becomes Green (3).
    *   Example 3: Blue object has 5 pixels, no internal holes -> Azure becomes Red (2).
    *   Example 4: Blue object has 6 pixels, no internal holes -> Azure becomes Green (3).
    *   Example 5: Blue object has 5 pixels, no internal holes -> Azure becomes Red (2).

**Facts (YAML Block):**


```yaml
task_description: Recolor an azure object based on properties of a blue object, then remove the blue object.
background_color: white (0)

input_elements:
  - element: primary_object
    color: azure (8)
    location: variable, generally upper grid
    shape: variable
  - element: secondary_object
    color: blue (1)
    location: variable, generally lower grid
    shape: variable
    properties:
      - pixel_count: Number of blue pixels (N).
      - internal_holes: Presence of white (0) pixels completely surrounded (4-connectivity) by blue pixels (H=1 if present, H=0 if absent).

output_elements:
  - element: transformed_object
    source: primary_object (azure)
    location: same as primary_object
    shape: same as primary_object
    color: target_color (determined by secondary_object properties)
  - element: removed_object
    source: secondary_object (blue)
    status: Removed (pixels set to white 0)

color_mapping_rule:
  description: The target_color for the transformed_object is determined by the pixel_count (N) and internal_holes (H) of the secondary_object (blue).
  conditions:
    - condition: N=5 and H=0
      target_color: red (2)
    - condition: N=6 and H=0
      target_color: green (3)
    - condition: N=6 and H=1
      target_color: orange (7)

grid_properties:
  size: variable
  background: remains white (0)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all connected pixels with the color blue (1). This constitutes the 'blue object'.
3.  Count the number of pixels (`N`) in the blue object.
4.  Determine if the blue object has any internal 'holes'. A hole is defined as a white (0) pixel where all four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) are blue (1) pixels. Set a flag `H` to 1 if at least one hole exists, otherwise set `H` to 0.
5.  Determine the `target_color` based on the values of `N` and `H`:
    *   If `N` is 5 and `H` is 0, set `target_color` to red (2).
    *   If `N` is 6 and `H` is 0, set `target_color` to green (3).
    *   If `N` is 6 and `H` is 1, set `target_color` to orange (7).
6.  Iterate through all pixels in the input grid:
    *   If a pixel belongs to the blue object (color is 1), change its color to white (0) in the output grid.
    *   If a pixel has the color azure (8), change its color to the determined `target_color` in the output grid.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
