            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Background:** The grids consistently use white (0) as the background color, which remains unchanged in the output.\n2.  **Input Objects:** Each input grid contains exactly two distinct non-background objects:\n    *   An object composed of azure (8) pixels, located generally in the upper part of the grid. Its shape varies across examples.\n    *   An object composed of blue (1) pixels, located generally in the lower part of the grid. Its shape also varies.\n3.  **Output Objects:** Each output grid contains only *one* non-background object.\n    *   This object occupies the exact same position and has the exact same shape as the *azure* object from the input.\n    *   The color of this object in the output is *not* azure (8). It changes based on the input.\n    *   The *blue* object from the input is completely absent in the output (replaced by the white background).\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation involves removing the blue object and recoloring the azure object. The key is determining the rule for the new color.\n5.  **Color Rule Clue:** The color change applied to the azure object seems dependent on properties of the *removed* blue object. Let's examine the blue objects and the resulting colors:\n    *   Example 1: Blue object has 6 pixels, contains one internal hole -> Azure becomes Orange (7).\n    *   Example 2: Blue object has 6 pixels, no internal holes -> Azure becomes Green (3).\n    *   Example 3: Blue object has 5 pixels, no internal holes -> Azure becomes Red (2).\n    *   Example 4: Blue object has 6 pixels, no internal holes -> Azure becomes Green (3).\n    *   Example 5: Blue object has 5 pixels, no internal holes -> Azure becomes Red (2).\n\n**Facts (YAML Block):**\n\n"
