task_description: Recolor an azure object based on properties of a blue object, then remove the blue object.
background_color: white (0)

input_elements:
  - element: primary_object
    color: azure (8)
    location: variable, generally upper grid
    shape: variable
  - element: secondary_object
    color: blue (1)
    location: variable, generally lower grid
    shape: variable
    properties:
      - pixel_count: Number of blue pixels (N).
      - internal_holes: Presence of white (0) pixels completely surrounded (4-connectivity) by blue pixels (H=1 if present, H=0 if absent).

output_elements:
  - element: transformed_object
    source: primary_object (azure)
    location: same as primary_object
    shape: same as primary_object
    color: target_color (determined by secondary_object properties)
  - element: removed_object
    source: secondary_object (blue)
    status: Removed (pixels set to white 0)

color_mapping_rule:
  description: The target_color for the transformed_object is determined by the pixel_count (N) and internal_holes (H) of the secondary_object (blue).
  conditions:
    - condition: N=5 and H=0
      target_color: red (2)
    - condition: N=6 and H=0
      target_color: green (3)
    - condition: N=6 and H=1
      target_color: orange (7)

grid_properties:
  size: variable
  background: remains white (0)
