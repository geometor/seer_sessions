Task: Add colored lines based on 3x3 blocks.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
  - Objects:
    - Pixels: Individual cells with a color value.
    - Background: Pixels with color 0 (white).
    - Blocks_3x3: Contiguous 3x3 areas where all 9 pixels have the same non-white color.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Modified version of the input grid.

Transformations:
  - Identify: Locate all unique 3x3 blocks of a single non-white color in the input grid.
  - Properties_Extraction: For each identified 3x3 block:
    - Extract its color (C).
    - Determine its center coordinates (R_center, L_center).
  - Actions:
    - Create a copy of the input grid.
    - For each identified block:
      - Fill_Column: Iterate through the column index L_center. For each row r, if the pixel (r, L_center) in the copied grid is white (0), change its color to C.
      - Fill_Row: Iterate through the row index R_center. For each column l, if the pixel (R_center, l) in the copied grid is white (0), change its color to C.
  - Ordering/Precedence: Row fills are applied after column fills (or conceptually have higher priority). If a white pixel is at the intersection of a column fill and a row fill, it takes the color of the row fill.

Relationships:
  - Each 3x3 block in the input uniquely determines one row fill and one column fill in the output.
  - The color of the fill lines matches the color of the triggering 3x3 block.
  - The position of the fill lines is determined by the center of the triggering 3x3 block.
  - Fill lines only modify background pixels (color 0).
