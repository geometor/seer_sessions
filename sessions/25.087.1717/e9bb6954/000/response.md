Okay, let's analyze the provided examples (`train_1` to `train_4`) to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels (0-9). The grid dimensions vary between examples.
2.  **Core Transformation:** The primary transformation involves adding lines (rows and columns) of specific colors to the grid. The original pixels and objects seem largely preserved, with the new lines primarily filling in the white (0) background pixels.
3.  **Trigger Identification:** The addition of these lines seems linked to the presence of solid `3x3` squares of a single non-white color in the input grid.
4.  **Line Placement:** For each `3x3` square of color `C` found in the input:
    *   A horizontal line (row) of color `C` is added.
    *   A vertical line (column) of color `C` is added.
    *   The specific row and column indices correspond to the *center* coordinates of the `3x3` square. If a `3x3` square's top-left corner is at `(R, L)`, its center is at `(R+1, L+1)`. The row fill happens at index `R+1`, and the column fill happens at index `L+1`.
5.  **Overwriting Rules:**
    *   The added lines only overwrite pixels that were originally white (0).
    *   Existing non-white pixels from the input grid are generally preserved.
    *   At intersections where a white pixel could be overwritten by both a row fill (color `C_row`) and a column fill (color `C_col`), the color of the **row fill** (`C_row`) takes precedence.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Add colored lines based on 3x3 blocks.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
  - Objects:
    - Pixels: Individual cells with a color value.
    - Background: Pixels with color 0 (white).
    - Blocks_3x3: Contiguous 3x3 areas where all 9 pixels have the same non-white color.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Modified version of the input grid.

Transformations:
  - Identify: Locate all unique 3x3 blocks of a single non-white color in the input grid.
  - Properties_Extraction: For each identified 3x3 block:
    - Extract its color (C).
    - Determine its center coordinates (R_center, L_center).
  - Actions:
    - Create a copy of the input grid.
    - For each identified block:
      - Fill_Column: Iterate through the column index L_center. For each row r, if the pixel (r, L_center) in the copied grid is white (0), change its color to C.
      - Fill_Row: Iterate through the row index R_center. For each column l, if the pixel (R_center, l) in the copied grid is white (0), change its color to C.
  - Ordering/Precedence: Row fills are applied after column fills (or conceptually have higher priority). If a white pixel is at the intersection of a column fill and a row fill, it takes the color of the row fill.

Relationships:
  - Each 3x3 block in the input uniquely determines one row fill and one column fill in the output.
  - The color of the fill lines matches the color of the triggering 3x3 block.
  - The position of the fill lines is determined by the center of the triggering 3x3 block.
  - Fill lines only modify background pixels (color 0).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a working copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find all instances of solid `3x3` squares composed of a single non-white color.
3.  For each `3x3` square found:
    a.  Note its color, `C`.
    b.  Calculate the row index, `R_center`, and column index, `L_center`, of the center pixel of the `3x3` square.
    c.  Store the triplet (`C`, `R_center`, `L_center`).
4.  Process Column Fills: Iterate through the stored triplets (`C`, `R_center`, `L_center`). For each triplet, iterate through all rows `r` of the working grid. If the pixel at `(r, L_center)` is currently white (0), change its color to `C`.
5.  Process Row Fills: Iterate through the stored triplets (`C`, `R_center`, `L_center`). For each triplet, iterate through all columns `l` of the working grid. If the pixel at `(R_center, l)` is currently white (0), change its color to `C`. (This step naturally handles intersection precedence, as any pixel changed in step 4 that is also targeted here will be overwritten by the row color).
6.  Return the modified working grid as the output.
