In the provided example (`train_1`), there are two such shapes, appearing somewhat like offset plus signs or diamonds.\n3.  **Transformation:** The output grid preserves the original azure shapes in their exact positions.\n4.  **Added Elements:** New pixels, specifically yellow ones (color 4), appear in the output grid.\n5.  **Placement of Added Elements:** The yellow pixels are located in positions immediately surrounding the azure shapes. They occupy cells that were originally white (0) in the input grid and are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one azure (8) pixel. It looks like an 8-connected boundary or \"aura\" around the azure objects is colored yellow.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
