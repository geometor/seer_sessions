definitions:
  - background_color: white # Color 0
  - primary_object_color: azure # Color 8
  - added_object_color: yellow # Color 4
input_grid:
  - contains: background_color
  - contains: primary_objects (composed of primary_object_color)
output_grid:
  - maintains: background_color (where not adjacent to primary_objects)
  - maintains: primary_objects (identical position and color as input)
  - adds: added_objects (composed of added_object_color)
transformation_rules:
  - rule: Identify all cells containing the background_color in the input grid.
  - rule: For each identified background cell, check its 8 neighbors (including diagonals).
  - rule: If any neighbor contains the primary_object_color, change the color of the identified background cell to the added_object_color in the output grid.
  - rule: Cells containing the primary_object_color remain unchanged.
  - rule: Background cells not adjacent (8-connectivity) to any primary_object_color remain unchanged.
grid_properties:
  - dimension_preservation: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
