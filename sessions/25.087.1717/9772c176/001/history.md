**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Background:** The grid predominantly consists of a white background (color 0).
2.  **Primary Objects:** The input contains distinct shapes composed of azure pixels (color 8). In the provided example (`train_1`), there are two such shapes, appearing somewhat like offset plus signs or diamonds.
3.  **Transformation:** The output grid preserves the original azure shapes in their exact positions.
4.  **Added Elements:** New pixels, specifically yellow ones (color 4), appear in the output grid.
5.  **Placement of Added Elements:** The yellow pixels are located in positions immediately surrounding the azure shapes. They occupy cells that were originally white (0) in the input grid and are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one azure (8) pixel. It looks like an 8-connected boundary or "aura" around the azure objects is colored yellow.

**Facts:**


```yaml
definitions:
  - background_color: white # Color 0
  - primary_object_color: azure # Color 8
  - added_object_color: yellow # Color 4
input_grid:
  - contains: background_color
  - contains: primary_objects (composed of primary_object_color)
output_grid:
  - maintains: background_color (where not adjacent to primary_objects)
  - maintains: primary_objects (identical position and color as input)
  - adds: added_objects (composed of added_object_color)
transformation_rules:
  - rule: Identify all cells containing the background_color in the input grid.
  - rule: For each identified background cell, check its 8 neighbors (including diagonals).
  - rule: If any neighbor contains the primary_object_color, change the color of the identified background cell to the added_object_color in the output grid.
  - rule: Cells containing the primary_object_color remain unchanged.
  - rule: Background cells not adjacent (8-connectivity) to any primary_object_color remain unchanged.
grid_properties:
  - dimension_preservation: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell `(row, col)` of the input grid.
3.  Check if the color of the cell `input[row][col]` is white (0).
4.  If the cell is white, check all 8 neighboring cells (including diagonals) relative to `(row, col)` in the input grid.
5.  If any of these neighbors has the color azure (8), then set the color of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid `output[row][col]` to yellow (4).
6.  If the cell `input[row][col]` is not white, or if it is white but none of its 8 neighbors are azure, the cell `output[row][col]` retains its original color from the input grid.
7.  After checking all cells, the final `output` grid represents the result.
