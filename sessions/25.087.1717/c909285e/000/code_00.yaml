task_type: extraction
components:
  - role: input_grid
    description: A large 2D grid containing patterns and lines.
  - role: output_grid
    description: A smaller 2D grid which is a subgrid of the input.
  - role: frame
    description: A rectangular border within the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: A single, solid color that forms the entire border (top, bottom, left, right edges). This color varies between examples (red, green, magenta).
      - location: Defines the top-left and bottom-right corners of the subgrid to be extracted.
      - contiguity: The frame pixels are contiguous along each edge.
      - uniqueness: In each example, there appears to be only one such frame formed by a single color enclosing a varied internal pattern.
actions:
  - name: find_frame
    description: Scan the input grid to locate the unique rectangular frame formed by a single color.
    input: input_grid
    output: frame_color, frame_location (top, left, bottom, right coordinates)
  - name: extract_subgrid
    description: Extract the rectangular region from the input grid defined by the frame's location.
    input: input_grid, frame_location
    output: output_grid
relationship:
  - type: identity
    description: The output_grid is identical to the subgrid identified and extracted from the input_grid based on the discovered frame.
