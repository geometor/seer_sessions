Additionally, new patterns with the *exact same 3x3 shape* appear, but these new patterns are colored azure (8).\n3.  **Pattern Placement:** The placement of the new azure patterns seems related to the positions of the original blue patterns. Specifically, if we consider the set of unique row coordinates (R) and unique column coordinates (C) where the top-left corner of a blue pattern exists in the input, the new azure patterns appear at coordinates (r, c) such that r is in R, c is in C, but no blue pattern started at (r, c) in the input.\n4.  **Consistency:** This relationship holds for both examples. The process essentially \"completes the grid\" formed by the unique rows and columns occupied by the input patterns. Positions already occupied by a blue pattern remain blue; the newly filled positions get the azure pattern.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
