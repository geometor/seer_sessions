facts:
  - object:
      type: pattern
      shape: 3x3 hollow square # [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
      color: blue (1)
      role: source
  - object:
      type: pattern
      shape: 3x3 hollow square # [[8,8,8],[8,0,8],[8,8,8]]
      color: azure (8)
      role: derived
  - property:
      name: location
      description: Top-left coordinate (row, column) of each pattern instance.
  - relationship:
      type: positional_derivation
      description: >
        The locations of the derived azure patterns are determined by the
        Cartesian product of the unique row indices and unique column indices
        of the source blue patterns' locations.
  - action:
      name: identify_patterns
      input: input grid
      output: set of top-left coordinates for all blue source patterns, S_input = {(r_i, c_i)}.
  - action:
      name: determine_coordinates
      input: set S_input
      output: >
        Set of unique row indices R = {r_i} and set of unique column indices C = {c_i}.
  - action:
      name: calculate_target_coordinates
      input: sets R and C
      output: Set of all possible coordinate pairs P = R x C = {(r, c) | r in R, c in C}.
  - action:
      name: identify_new_pattern_coordinates
      input: sets P and S_input
      output: Set of coordinates for new azure patterns, S_new = P - S_input.
  - action:
      name: generate_output
      steps:
        - Copy the input grid to create the output grid.
        - For each coordinate (r, c) in S_new:
          - Draw the derived azure pattern shape with its top-left corner at (r, c) onto the output grid.
