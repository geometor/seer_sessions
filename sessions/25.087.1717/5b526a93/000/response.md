Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple instances of a specific 3x3 pattern made of blue (1) pixels against a white (0) background. This pattern is a hollow square or frame:
    
```
    1 1 1
    1 0 1
    1 1 1
    ```

2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain all the original blue patterns from the input. Additionally, new patterns with the *exact same 3x3 shape* appear, but these new patterns are colored azure (8).
3.  **Pattern Placement:** The placement of the new azure patterns seems related to the positions of the original blue patterns. Specifically, if we consider the set of unique row coordinates (R) and unique column coordinates (C) where the top-left corner of a blue pattern exists in the input, the new azure patterns appear at coordinates (r, c) such that r is in R, c is in C, but no blue pattern started at (r, c) in the input.
4.  **Consistency:** This relationship holds for both examples. The process essentially "completes the grid" formed by the unique rows and columns occupied by the input patterns. Positions already occupied by a blue pattern remain blue; the newly filled positions get the azure pattern.

**Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - object:
      type: pattern
      shape: 3x3 hollow square # [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
      color: blue (1)
      role: source
  - object:
      type: pattern
      shape: 3x3 hollow square # [[8,8,8],[8,0,8],[8,8,8]]
      color: azure (8)
      role: derived
  - property:
      name: location
      description: Top-left coordinate (row, column) of each pattern instance.
  - relationship:
      type: positional_derivation
      description: >
        The locations of the derived azure patterns are determined by the
        Cartesian product of the unique row indices and unique column indices
        of the source blue patterns' locations.
  - action:
      name: identify_patterns
      input: input grid
      output: set of top-left coordinates for all blue source patterns, S_input = {(r_i, c_i)}.
  - action:
      name: determine_coordinates
      input: set S_input
      output: >
        Set of unique row indices R = {r_i} and set of unique column indices C = {c_i}.
  - action:
      name: calculate_target_coordinates
      input: sets R and C
      output: Set of all possible coordinate pairs P = R x C = {(r, c) | r in R, c in C}.
  - action:
      name: identify_new_pattern_coordinates
      input: sets P and S_input
      output: Set of coordinates for new azure patterns, S_new = P - S_input.
  - action:
      name: generate_output
      steps:
        - Copy the input grid to create the output grid.
        - For each coordinate (r, c) in S_new:
          - Draw the derived azure pattern shape with its top-left corner at (r, c) onto the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all occurrences of the 3x3 blue (1) hollow square pattern (where the center is white (0)) in the input grid.
2.  Record the top-left row and column coordinates for each found blue pattern.
3.  Create a set of all unique row coordinates (R) and a set of all unique column coordinates (C) from the recorded locations.
4.  Generate all possible coordinate pairs (r, c) by taking the Cartesian product of the set R and set C. This represents the potential locations for patterns in a complete grid based on the input rows and columns.
5.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
6.  For each coordinate pair (r, c) generated in step 4:
    *   Check if a blue pattern already exists with its top-left corner at (r, c) in the original input grid.
    *   If no blue pattern exists at (r, c) in the input, draw the 3x3 hollow square pattern using azure (8) color (leaving the center white (0)) onto the output grid, starting at position (r, c).
7.  The resulting grid is the final output.
