These lines, along with the yellow line, seem to form a static frame.\n    *   In the input grid, there is a distinct object or pattern composed of various colors located entirely to the *left* of the vertical yellow line.\n    *   In the output grid, the original object on the left remains unchanged. Additionally, a *new* object appears on the *right* side of the vertical yellow line.\n    *   This new object on the right is a horizontal reflection (mirror image) of the object on the left, using the yellow line as the axis of reflection. All other elements (background, yellow line, azure lines, left object) remain in their original positions.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Check if the pixel's color is *not* the background color (orange 7) and *not* part of the horizontal frame lines (azure 8). (Checking against frame colors might be redundant if the object never overlaps the frame, but it's safer).\n        b.  If it meets the criteria (i.e., it's part of the object to be reflected), calculate the horizontal distance from the axis: `distance = axis_col - col`.\n        c.  Calculate the corresponding column index for the reflection on the right side: `reflected_col = axis_col + distance`.\n        d.  Set the color of the pixel at `(row, reflected_col)` in the *output* grid to be the same as the color of the input pixel at `(row, col)`.\n    5.  The resulting output grid contains the original input elements plus the newly created reflection on the right side."
