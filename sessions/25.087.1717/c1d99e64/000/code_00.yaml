task_description: Identify rows and columns composed entirely of white pixels and change all pixels within those rows/columns to red.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - Represents a 2D space.
      - Composed of pixels with color values (0-9).
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - Has a color value.
      - Located at a specific row and column index.
  - type: row
    properties:
      - A horizontal sequence of pixels in the grid.
      - Can be identified by its row index.
  - type: column
    properties:
      - A vertical sequence of pixels in the grid.
      - Can be identified by its column index.

constants:
  - color: white
    value: 0
  - color: red
    value: 2

relationships:
  - A row is composed entirely of white pixels if every pixel in that row has the color value 0.
  - A column is composed entirely of white pixels if every pixel in that column has the color value 0.

actions:
  - identify: Find all rows in the input grid that are composed entirely of white pixels.
  - identify: Find all columns in the input grid that are composed entirely of white pixels.
  - modify: Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - modify: For each identified all-white row, change the color of all pixels in that row (in the output grid copy) to red (2).
  - modify: For each identified all-white column, change the color of all pixels in that column (in the output grid copy) to red (2).
