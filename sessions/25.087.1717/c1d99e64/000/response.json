The output grids introduce red (2) while retaining the original dominant color and some white pixels.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation involves changing certain pixels to red (2). The key observation is that entire rows or entire columns are being modified.\n4.  **Condition for Change:** By comparing input and output grids across examples, it becomes clear that if a row or a column in the input grid consists *entirely* of white (0) pixels, then all pixels in that specific row or column are changed to red (2) in the output grid.\n5.  **Overlap:** If a pixel belongs to both an all-white row and an all-white column, it is changed to red (2).\n6.  **Unaffected Pixels:** Pixels in rows or columns that are not entirely white retain their original color from the input grid, unless they fall within an all-white column or row, respectively.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
