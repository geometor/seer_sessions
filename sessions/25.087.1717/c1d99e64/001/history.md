**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example consists of an input grid and a corresponding output grid of the same dimensions.
2.  **Colors:** The input grids use white (0) and one other dominant color (azure (8) in example 1, blue (1) in example 2, green (3) in example 3). The output grids introduce red (2) while retaining the original dominant color and some white pixels.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation involves changing certain pixels to red (2). The key observation is that entire rows or entire columns are being modified.
4.  **Condition for Change:** By comparing input and output grids across examples, it becomes clear that if a row or a column in the input grid consists *entirely* of white (0) pixels, then all pixels in that specific row or column are changed to red (2) in the output grid.
5.  **Overlap:** If a pixel belongs to both an all-white row and an all-white column, it is changed to red (2).
6.  **Unaffected Pixels:** Pixels in rows or columns that are not entirely white retain their original color from the input grid, unless they fall within an all-white column or row, respectively.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify rows and columns composed entirely of white pixels and change all pixels within those rows/columns to red.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - Represents a 2D space.
      - Composed of pixels with color values (0-9).
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - Has a color value.
      - Located at a specific row and column index.
  - type: row
    properties:
      - A horizontal sequence of pixels in the grid.
      - Can be identified by its row index.
  - type: column
    properties:
      - A vertical sequence of pixels in the grid.
      - Can be identified by its column index.

constants:
  - color: white
    value: 0
  - color: red
    value: 2

relationships:
  - A row is composed entirely of white pixels if every pixel in that row has the color value 0.
  - A column is composed entirely of white pixels if every pixel in that column has the color value 0.

actions:
  - identify: Find all rows in the input grid that are composed entirely of white pixels.
  - identify: Find all columns in the input grid that are composed entirely of white pixels.
  - modify: Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - modify: For each identified all-white row, change the color of all pixels in that row (in the output grid copy) to red (2).
  - modify: For each identified all-white column, change the color of all pixels in that column (in the output grid copy) to red (2).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid:
    a.  Check if all pixels in the current row have the color white (0).
    b.  If they do, then for every pixel in that corresponding row in the *output* grid, change its color to red (2).
3.  Iterate through each column of the input grid:
    a.  Check if all pixels in the current column have the color white (0).
    b.  If they do, then for every pixel in that corresponding column in the *output* grid, change its color to red (2).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
