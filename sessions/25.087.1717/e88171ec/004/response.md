Hold on, my manual identification of squares in Example 3 was wrong. Let me re-examine the grid and the code output.

*   Input Grid (Example 3, relevant section around row 10-14, col 7-12):
    
```
    ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
    ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
    ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

    ... ... ... ... 0  0  0  0  3  3  3  3  0  3  3  3
    0 0 0 3 0 3 3 [0  0  0  0  0] 0  3  0  0  <- Row 10
    0 3 3 3 3 0 0 [0  0  0  0  0] 0  0  3  3  <- Row 11
    3 0 0 0 3 0 3 [0  0  0  0  0] 0  3  3  3  <- Row 12
    0 0 0 3 3 3 3 [0  0  0  0  0] 0  0  0  3  <- Row 13
    3 3 3 3 3 3 0 [0  0  0] 3  3  3  3  0  3  0
    0 0 0 3 3 0 0 [3  3  0] 3  3  0  0  3  3
                     ^  ^  ^  ^  ^
                     C7 C8 C9 C10 C11
    ```

*   The code output identifies three 4x4 white squares: `(10, 7)`, `(10, 8)`, `(10, 9)`. Let's check:
    *   `(10, 7)`: `grid[10:14, 7:11]` -> Correct, all zeros.
    *   `(10, 8)`: `grid[10:14, 8:12]` -> Correct, all zeros.
    *   `(10, 9)`: `grid[10:14, 9:13]` -> Correct, all zeros.
*   The *Expected* output wants the square at `(11, 8)` filled. Let's check `grid[11:15, 8:12]`:
    
```
    Row 11: 0 0 0 0
    Row 12: 0 0 0 0
    Row 13: 0 0 0 0
    Row 14: 0 0 0 3  <- Contains a 3!
    ```

    So, `(11, 8)` is *not* a 4x4 white square.
*   This invalidates Example 3 as a case for testing tie-breaking rules for the *largest* square, because the expected output doesn't fill one of the largest white squares.

**Revised Assessment:**

Examples 1 and 2 strongly suggest that the task is *not* to find the single largest white square. Example 3's expected output seems anomalous if the rule involves finding *any* purely white square, as the selected area isn't purely white in the input.

Let's reconsider Example 3's Expected Output: A 4x4 azure square at `(11, 8)`.
Look at the *Input* grid again in that area `(11, 8)` to `(14, 11)`.

```
11: 0 0 0 0
12: 0 0 0 0
13: 0 0 0 0
14: 0 0 0 3
```

And the output fills this with 8s:

```
11: 8 8 8 8
12: 8 8 8 8
13: 8 8 8 8
14: 8 8 8 8
```

This means the transformation filled an area that was *mostly* white but contained a non-white pixel (3). This changes everything.

**New Hypothesis:** The task might be to find the largest square area that is *almost* white (perhaps allowing one non-white cell?) and fill it with azure? Or maybe find the largest square that has the *most* white cells?

Let's test "most white cells" for Example 3:
*   Square (10, 7), size 4x4: 16 white cells.
*   Square (10, 8), size 4x4: 16 white cells.
*   Square (10, 9), size 4x4: 16 white cells.
*   Square (11, 8), size 4x4: 15 white cells, 1 non-white (3).

This doesn't fit either, as the expected output selects the square with *fewer* white cells than the others of the same size.

**Let's re-examine the relationship between Input and Expected Output systematically.**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has white squares of sizes 4x4, 3x3, 2x2, 1x1. Max size is 4x4.
    *   Output fills a 2x2 square at (4, 6).
    *   Input[4:6, 6:8] = [[0, 0], [0, 0]] (This is a white square).
    *   Why this 2x2 square? It's not the largest. Is it the largest *isolated* white square (not touching another white pixel outside its bounds)? No. Is it the top-leftmost? No. Bottom-rightmost? No. Is it the largest square containing only white pixels? Yes. Is it the largest among squares with a certain property?
    *   Let's check the squares found by the previous code again.
        *   4x4 at (3, 5)
        *   3x3 at (5, 5) and (11, 8)
        *   2x2 at (4, 6), (6,6), (10,8), (10,10), (11,8), (11,9), (11,10), (12,8), (12,9), (12,10), (13,8), (13,9), (13,10).
    *   Expected output picks (4, 6) size 2. The code picked (3, 5) size 4.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has white squares of sizes 5x5, 4x4, 3x3, 2x2, 1x1. Max size is 5x5.
    *   Output fills a 3x3 square at (5, 5).
    *   Input[5:8, 5:8] = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]] (This is a white square).
    *   Why this 3x3 square? It's not the largest.
    *   Squares found:
        *   5x5 at (5, 4)
        *   4x4 at (10, 8)
        *   3x3 at (5, 5), (16, 14)
    *   Expected output picks (5, 5) size 3. The code picked (5, 4) size 5.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input has white squares of sizes 4x4, 3x3, 2x2, 1x1. Max size is 4x4.
    *   Output fills a 4x4 area at (11, 8).
    *   Input[11:15, 8:12] = [[0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,3]]. This area is *not* a white square.
    *   Largest white squares found: (10, 7), (10, 8), (10, 9), all size 4x4.
    *   Expected output picks area (11, 8) size 4x4. The code picked (10, 9) size 4x4 using bottom-right tiebreak on row 10 squares. (Wait, the code output said `{'r': 10, 'c': 9, 'size': 4}` was chosen with bottom-right rule... Ah, because among `(10, 7), (10, 8), (10, 9)`, they all have the same row 10. So it goes to the column tie-break: max column is 9. So `(10, 9)` is correct for the code's logic).

**Contradiction:** Examples 1 & 2 require selecting a *smaller* white square than the maximum available. Example 3 requires selecting an area that *isn't* a white square, although it's the same size as the largest actual white squares.

**Is there a different definition of "object"?** What if the "object" isn't the white square itself, but something defined *by* the white squares?

Look at the locations:
*   Ex 1: Largest white 4x4@(3,5). Expected output fills 2x2@(4,6).
*   Ex 2: Largest white 5x5@(5,4). Expected output fills 3x3@(5,5).
*   Ex 3: Largest white 4x4@(10,7), (10,8), (10,9). Expected output fills 4x4 area @(11,8).

Maybe the rule involves finding *all* maximal white squares (squares not contained within a larger white square)?
*   Ex 1: Maximal white squares: 4x4@(3,5), 3x3@(11,8), potentially others?
*   Ex 2: Maximal white squares: 5x5@(5,4), 4x4@(10,8), 3x3@(16,14).
*   Ex 3: Maximal white squares: 4x4@(10,7), 4x4@(10,8), 4x4@(10,9).

This doesn't seem to lead anywhere directly.

**Alternative approach: Focus on the selected area in the output.**
What is special about the *location* and *size* chosen in the expected output?

*   Ex 1: Output 2x2 @ (4, 6). Input @ (4, 6) is white.
*   Ex 2: Output 3x3 @ (5, 5). Input @ (5, 5) is white.
*   Ex 3: Output 4x4 @ (11, 8). Input @ (11, 8) is *mostly* white (15/16).

Is it the largest square S such that S is contained entirely *within* the bounding box of *all* white pixels?
Let's find the bounding box of all white pixels for each example.

``` python
import numpy as np

def get_bounding_box(grid, color):
    pixels = np.argwhere(grid == color)
    if pixels.size == 0:

                subgrid = grid[r:r+size, c:c+size]
                if np.all(subgrid == 0):
                    white_squares.append({'r': r, 'c': c, 'size': size})

    max_white_size = 0
    if white_squares:
         max_white_size = max(s['size'] for s in white_squares)
    
    print(f"Max white square size found: {max_white_size}")
    largest_white_squares = [s for s in white_squares if s['size'] == max_white_size]
    print(f"Largest white squares ({max_white_size}x{max_white_size}): {largest_white_squares}")

    print(f"Expected output square: r={expected_r}, c={expected_c}, size={expected_size}")
    
    # Check if expected square is within the bounding box
    if bbox:
        is_within_bbox = (expected_r >= min_r and 
                          expected_c >= min_c and 
                          expected_r + expected_size - 1 <= max_r and 
                          expected_c + expected_size - 1 <= max_c)
        print(f"Is expected square within white bounding box? {is_within_bbox}")

    # Check if the expected output square is actually white in the input
    expected_subgrid = grid[expected_r:expected_r+expected_size, expected_c:expected_c+expected_size]
    is_all_white = np.all(expected_subgrid == 0)
    white_count = np.sum(expected_subgrid == 0)
    total_count = expected_subgrid.size
    print(f"Is expected square area all white in input? {is_all_white}. White pixels: {white_count}/{total_count}")

**Correction:** My manual analysis of Example 2's largest white square was slightly off. The code found two 5x5 squares: `(4, 4)` and `(5, 4)`.
**Correction:** My manual analysis of Example 3's expected square purity was also slightly off. It has 13 white pixels, not 15. `grid[11:15, 8:12]` is:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3]]
```

Ah, I see. `grid[10,7]` is the top-left of the first 4x4. `grid[10:14, 7:11]`. OK.
`grid[11:15, 8:12]`
Row 11, Col 8 is 0.
Row 14, Col 11 is 3.

Let's re-read the analysis code output:
Example 3:
Expected square area `(11, 8)` size 4.
Input Grid segment `grid[11:15, 8:12]`:

```
11: [0, 0, 0, 0]
12: [0, 0, 0, 0]
13: [0, 0, 0, 0]
14: [0, 0, 0, 3]
```

The code output says "White pixels: 13/16". This is wrong. It should be 15/16. Why did the code get that wrong?
Let me re-run just that check.

Okay, I misread the grid *again*. The previous tool output *was* correct. The subgrid is `grid[11:15, 8:12]`:

This makes Example 3 even stranger. The area filled contains *three* non-white pixels.

**Summary of Findings So Far:**

1.  The task is NOT simply "find the largest white square and fill it". (Examples 1, 2)
2.  The task is NOT simply "find the largest white square and fill it using bottom-right tie-breaking". (Examples 1, 2, 3)
3.  The area to be filled is NOT necessarily composed entirely of white pixels in the input. (Example 3)
4.  The size of the filled area can be smaller than the largest available white square (Ex 1, Ex 2) or the same size (Ex 3, comparing output size 4x4 to largest *white* square size 4x4).

**Let's reconsider the prompt's priors:** Objectness, Goal-directedness, Numbers & counting, Basic geometry & topology.

Perhaps we need to identify a different kind of object. What if we consider "hollow squares" or "frames"?
*   Ex 1: Input has lots of '2's (red). Is there a red frame? Not obviously.
*   Ex 2: Input has lots of '4's (yellow). Maybe a yellow frame defines the area?
*   Ex 3: Input has lots of '3's (green).

Let's look for the largest square frame of a single non-white color that *encloses* the area that gets filled.

*   **Ex 1:** Output is 2x2 @ (4, 6). Area is `grid[4:6, 6:8]`. Can we find a frame around this? A 4x4 frame? `grid[3:7, 5:9]`. The border pixels are not uniform.
*   **Ex 2:** Output is 3x3 @ (5, 5). Area is `grid[5:8, 5:8]`. Look for a frame, maybe 5x5? `grid[4:9, 4:9]`. The border is mostly yellow (4) but not exclusively.
*   **Ex 3:** Output is 4x4 @ (11, 8). Area is `grid[11:15, 8:12]`. Look for a frame, maybe 6x6? `grid[10:16, 7:13]`. The border is mostly green (3) but mixed with 0s.

This frame idea doesn't seem consistent.

**What if the rule is about maximizing white pixels within *some* square?**

Find the square subgrid (of any size, at any location) that contains the maximum number of white pixels. If there's a tie, apply a tie-breaking rule.

Let's recalculate for Example 1:
*   4x4 @ (3, 5): 16 white pixels.
*   5x5 @ (3, 5): `grid[3:8, 5:10]` -> Contains non-zeros. Count zeros.
*   Calculate white pixel counts for all possible squares. This is computationally intensive.

Maybe it's simpler. "Find the largest *empty* (all white) square S. Fill S with azure." This was the original interpretation that failed.

Let's revisit the failed examples and the *chosen* squares:
*   Ex 1: Largest white is 4x4 @ (3, 5). Chosen is 2x2 @ (4, 6).
*   Ex 2: Largest white are 5x5 @ (4, 4) and (5, 4). Chosen is 3x3 @ (5, 5).
*   Ex 3: Largest white are 4x4 @ (10, 7), (10, 8), (10, 9). Chosen *area* is 4x4 @ (11, 8), which is *not* white.

There *must* be a property that distinguishes the chosen square/area.

Consider the concept of "holes". White areas can be seen as holes in the non-white background.
*   Ex 1: The 4x4 hole @ (3,5) is the largest. The 2x2 hole @ (4,6) is chosen.
*   Ex 2: The 5x5 holes @ (4,4) and (5,4) are largest. The 3x3 hole @ (5,5) is chosen.
*   Ex 3: The 4x4 holes @ (10,7/8/9) are largest. The *area* @ (11,8) is chosen (not a pure hole).

Is it the white square with the highest "density" of non-white neighbors?
*   Ex 1: Square (4, 6) size 2. Neighbors: (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0, (4,5)=2, (4,8)=0, (5,5)=2, (5,8)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=0. Perimeter = 8. Non-white neighbors = 2. Density = 2/8.
    Square (3, 5) size 4. Perimeter = 16. Neighbors: (2,5)=0, (2,6)=2, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=2, (3,4)=0, (3,9)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,9)=2, (5,4)=2, (5,9)=0, (6,4)=0, (6,9)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=0, (7,8)=2. Non-white = 5. Density = 5/16.
    The chosen square (2/8 = 0.25) has lower density than the largest (5/16 = 0.3125).

Maybe it's the white square closest to the center of the grid?
*   Ex 1: Grid 15x15. Center ~ (7, 7).
    *   Dist( (4,6), (7,7) ) = sqrt((7-4)^2 + (7-6)^2) = sqrt(3^2+1^2) = sqrt(10) ~ 3.16
    *   Dist( (3,5), (7,7) ) = sqrt((7-3)^2 + (7-5)^2) = sqrt(4^2+2^2) = sqrt(20) ~ 4.47
    The chosen square is closer to the center.
*   Ex 2: Grid 19x19. Center ~ (9, 9).
    *   Dist( (5,5), (9,9) ) = sqrt((9-5)^2 + (9-5)^2) = sqrt(4^2+4^2) = sqrt(32) ~ 5.66
    *   Dist( (4,4), (9,9) ) = sqrt((9-4)^2 + (9-4)^2) = sqrt(5^2+5^2) = sqrt(50) ~ 7.07
    *   Dist( (5,4), (9,9) ) = sqrt((9-5)^2 + (9-4)^2) = sqrt(4^2+5^2) = sqrt(41) ~ 6.40
    The chosen square (5,5) is closest to the center among these.
*   Ex 3: Grid 16x16. Center ~ (7.5, 7.5).
    *   Dist( (11,8), (7.5, 7.5) ) = sqrt((11-7.5)^2 + (8-7.5)^2) = sqrt(3.5^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(12.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(12.5) ~ 3.54
    *   Dist( (10,7), (7.5, 7.5) ) = sqrt((10-7.5)^2 + (7-7.5)^2) = sqrt(2.5^2 + (-0.5)^2) = sqrt(6.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(6.5) ~ 2.55
    *   Dist( (10,8), (7.5, 7.5) ) = sqrt((10-7.5)^2 + (8-7.5)^2) = sqrt(2.5^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(6.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(6.5) ~ 2.55
    *   Dist( (10,9), (7.5, 7.5) ) = sqrt((10-7.5)^2 + (9-7.5)^2) = sqrt(2.5^2 + 1.5^2) = sqrt(6.25 + 2.25) = sqrt(8.5) ~ 2.92
    Here, the chosen area (11, 8) is *not* the closest to the center among the largest white squares or the chosen area itself.

**Let's reconsider Example 3.** The chosen area `(11, 8)` size 4x4 is *almost* white (13/16 white pixels). The largest *purely* white squares are `(10, 7)`, `(10, 8)`, `(10, 9)`, all size 4x4 (16/16 white pixels).

What if the rule is:
1. Find the maximum size `S` such that there exists at least one `S x S` square subgrid containing *only* white pixels.
2. Identify *all* `S x S` square subgrids (locations `(r, c)`) that contain *only* white pixels.
3. Apply a tie-breaking rule to select one `(r*, c*)` from this set.
4. Fill the selected square `(r*, c*)` of size `S x S` with azure.

This works for Examples 1 and 2 if the tie-breaking rule is different. Let's re-evaluate the tie-breaking based on this "largest purely white square" idea.

*   **Ex 1:** Max white size S=4. Only one such square: (3, 5). Rule requires filling (3, 5). Expected output fills (4, 6) size 2. -> This rule still fails for Ex 1.
*   **Ex 2:** Max white size S=5. Two such squares: (4, 4), (5, 4). Rule requires filling one of these. Expected output fills (5, 5) size 3. -> This rule still fails for Ex 2.
*   **Ex 3:** Max white size S=4. Three such squares: (10, 7), (10, 8), (10, 9). Rule requires filling one of these. Expected output fills area (11, 8) size 4, which isn't purely white. -> This rule fails dramatically for Ex 3.

**The fundamental assumption about finding a *white* square seems flawed due to Example 3.**

What if the task involves finding a specific *pattern* or *object* and the azure square is placed relative to it? No obvious recurring patterns jump out.

Let's look at the colors again.
Ex 1: Background Red (2). Fill 2x2 white area.
Ex 2: Background Yellow (4). Fill 3x3 white area.
Ex 3: Background Green (3). Fill 4x4 almost-white area.

Is the size of the square related to the background color? 2 -> 2x2? 4 -> 3x3? 3 -> 4x4? No obvious mapping.

Could it be related to the *number* of maximal white squares?
Ex 1: Max size 4x4. One square. Output 2x2.
Ex 2: Max size 5x5. Two squares. Output 3x3.
Ex 3: Max size 4x4. Three squares. Output 4x4.

Hypothesis:
1. Find the size `S_max` of the largest square(s) composed entirely of white pixels.
2. Count the number `N` of such largest white squares.
3. The size of the output azure square is `S_out = f(N)`?
    *   N=1 -> S_out=2
    *   N=2 -> S_out=3
    *   N=3 -> S_out=4
    *   This suggests `S_out = N + 1`.
4. Determine the location `(r, c)` for the output square of size `S_out`. How?
    *   Ex 1: N=1. Largest square is 4x4 @ (3, 5). Output is 2x2 @ (4, 6). Location seems related? Center of 4x4 is (3+4/2, 5+4/2) = (5, 7). Center of 2x2 is (4+2/2, 6+2/2) = (5, 7). They share the same center!
    *   Ex 2: N=2. Largest squares are 5x5 @ (4, 4) and (5, 4). Output is 3x3 @ (5, 5).
        *   Center of (4, 4) size 5 = (4+2.5, 4+2.5) = (6.5, 6.5)
        *   Center of (5, 4) size 5 = (5+2.5, 4+2.5) = (7.5, 6.5)
        *   Center of output (5, 5) size 3 = (5+1.5, 5+1.5) = (6.5, 6.5)
        The output square shares the center with the *top-leftmost* of the largest white squares.
    *   Ex 3: N=3. Largest squares are 4x4 @ (10, 7), (10, 8), (10, 9). Output is 4x4 @ (11, 8).
        *   Center of (10, 7) size 4 = (10+2, 7+2) = (12, 9)
        *   Center of (10, 8) size 4 = (10+2, 8+2) = (12, 10)
        *   Center of (10, 9) size 4 = (10+2, 9+2) = (12, 11)
        *   Center of output (11, 8) size 4 = (11+2, 8+2) = (13, 10)
        This doesn't align perfectly. The centers are (12, 9/10/11) and (13, 10). The output center is one row below the average row of the largest white squares, and its column matches the middle largest white square.

Let's refine the location rule based on Ex 1 & 2.
Rule attempt:
1. Find largest white square size `S_max`.
2. Find all locations `(r, c)` of `S_max` x `S_max` white squares. Let this set be `L`.
3. Count `N = |L|`.
4. Output square size `S_out = N + 1`.
5. Select the square `(r*, c*)` from `L` that is top-most, then left-most.
6. Calculate the center `(center_r, center_c)` of this selected square `(r*, c*)`. `center_r = r* + S_max / 2`, `center_c = c* + S_max / 2`.
7. Calculate the top-left corner `(R_out, C_out)` of the output square using its size `S_out` and the calculated center. `R_out = round(center_r - S_out / 2)`, `C_out = round(center_c - S_out / 2)`. (Need to be careful with rounding/integer conversion). Let's use floor: `R_out = floor(center_r - S_out / 2)`, `C_out = floor(center_c - S_out / 2)`. Or maybe `R_out = r* + floor((S_max - S_out)/2)`, `C_out = c* + floor((S_max - S_out)/2)`?

Let's test this refined hypothesis:

*   **Ex 1:**
    1. S_max = 4.
    2. L = {(3, 5)}.
    3. N = 1.
    4. S_out = 1 + 1 = 2.
    5. Select (r*, c*) = (3, 5).
    6. Center = (3 + 4/2, 5 + 4/2) = (5, 7).
    7. R_out = floor(5 - 2/2) = floor(4) = 4. C_out = floor(7 - 2/2) = floor(6) = 6.
    8. Fill 2x2 square at (4, 6). -> Matches Expected Output!

*   **Ex 2:**
    1. S_max = 5.
    2. L = {(4, 4), (5, 4)}.
    3. N = 2.
    4. S_out = 2 + 1 = 3.
    5. Select top-leftmost from L: (4, 4). So (r*, c*) = (4, 4).
    6. Center = (4 + 5/2, 4 + 5/2) = (6.5, 6.5).
    7. R_out = floor(6.5 - 3/2) = floor(6.5 - 1.5) = floor(5) = 5. C_out = floor(6.5 - 3/2) = floor(5) = 5.
    8. Fill 3x3 square at (5, 5). -> Matches Expected Output!

*   **Ex 3:**
    1. S_max = 4.
    2. L = {(10, 7), (10, 8), (10, 9)}.
    3. N = 3.
    4. S_out = 3 + 1 = 4.
    5. Select top-leftmost from L: (10, 7). So (r*, c*) = (10, 7).
    6. Center = (10 + 4/2, 7 + 4/2) = (12, 9).
    7. R_out = floor(12 - 4/2) = floor(10) = 10. C_out = floor(9 - 4/2) = floor(7) = 7.
    8. Fill 4x4 square at (10, 7). -> Does NOT Match Expected Output (11, 8).

**Hypothesis failed on Example 3's location.**

What was different about Example 3? The N=3 largest white squares were all on the same row (10). Maybe the tie-breaking for selecting `(r*, c*)` is different? Or maybe the centering calculation?

What if we average the centers of *all* largest white squares?
*   Ex 1: Avg Center = (5, 7). R_out=4, C_out=6. (Matches)
*   Ex 2: Centers are (6.5, 6.5) and (7.5, 6.5). Average = (7, 6.5).
    R_out = floor(7 - 3/2) = floor(5.5) = 5. C_out = floor(6.5 - 3/2) = floor(5) = 5.
    Fill 3x3 at (5, 5). (Matches)
*   Ex 3: Centers are (12, 9), (12, 10), (12, 11). Average = (12, 10).
    R_out = floor(12 - 4/2) = floor(10) = 10. C_out = floor(10 - 4/2) = floor(8) = 8.
    Fill 4x4 at (10, 8). -> Still does NOT match Expected Output (11, 8).

Maybe the rule for location is simpler: Take the top-left coordinate `(r*, c*)` of the top-leftmost largest white square, and calculate the output top-left `(R_out, C_out)` based on the size difference?
`R_out = r* + floor((S_max - S_out)/2)`
`C_out = c* + floor((S_max - S_out)/2)`

*   Ex 1: (r*, c*) = (3, 5). S_max=4, S_out=2.
    R_out = 3 + floor((4-2)/2) = 3 + floor(1) = 4.
    C_out = 5 + floor((4-2)/2) = 5 + floor(1) = 6.
    Fill 2x2 @ (4, 6). (Matches)
*   Ex 2: (r*, c*) = (4, 4). S_max=5, S_out=3.
    R_out = 4 + floor((5-3)/2) = 4 + floor(1) = 5.
    C_out = 4 + floor((5-3)/2) = 4 + floor(1) = 5.
    Fill 3x3 @ (5, 5). (Matches)
*   Ex 3: (r*, c*) = (10, 7). S_max=4, S_out=4.
    R_out = 10 + floor((4-4)/2) = 10 + floor(0) = 10.
    C_out = 7 + floor((4-4)/2) = 7 + floor(0) = 7.
    Fill 4x4 @ (10, 7). (Still doesn't match (11, 8))

There must be something fundamentally different about Example 3, or my hypothesis about N determining size is wrong.

What if the size S_out is fixed based on something else? No, it changes (2, 3, 4).

What if the selection of `(r*, c*)` uses a different tie-breaker?
Try bottom-right tie-breaker for `(r*, c*)`:
*   Ex 1: (r*, c*) = (3, 5). -> Same result: Fill 2x2 @ (4, 6). (Matches)
*   Ex 2: L = {(4, 4), (5, 4)}. Bottom-most is (5, 4). Right-most (among those with max r) is (5, 4). So (r*, c*) = (5, 4).
    S_max=5, S_out=3.
    R_out = 5 + floor((5-3)/2) = 5 + 1 = 6.
    C_out = 4 + floor((5-3)/2) = 4 + 1 = 5.
    Fill 3x3 @ (6, 5). -> Does NOT match Expected Output (5, 5).

Try bottom-left tie-breaker for `(r*, c*)`:
*   Ex 2: L = {(4, 4), (5, 4)}. Bottom-most is (5, 4). Left-most (among those with max r) is (5, 4). So (r*, c*) = (5, 4). -> Same fail as bottom-right.

Try top-right tie-breaker for `(r*, c*)`:
*   Ex 2: L = {(4, 4), (5, 4)}. Top-most is (4, 4). Right-most (among those with min r) is (4, 4). So (r*, c*) = (4, 4).
    S_max=5, S_out=3.
    R_out = 4 + floor((5-3)/2) = 5.
    C_out = 4 + floor((5-3)/2) = 5.
    Fill 3x3 @ (5, 5). (Matches!)

Let's re-test this hypothesis (top-right `(r*, c*)` selection, `S_out = N+1`, location relative offset) on all examples:

*   **Ex 1:**
    1. S_max=4, L={(3,5)}, N=1, S_out=2.
    2. Select top-right from L: (r*, c*) = (3, 5).
    3. R_out = 3 + floor((4-2)/2) = 4. C_out = 5 + floor((4-2)/2) = 6.
    4. Fill 2x2 @ (4, 6). (Matches)

*   **Ex 2:**
    1. S_max=5, L={(4,4), (5,4)}, N=2, S_out=3.
    2. Select top-right from L: (r*, c*) = (4, 4).
    3. R_out = 4 + floor((5-3)/2) = 5. C_out = 4 + floor((5-3)/2) = 5.
    4. Fill 3x3 @ (5, 5). (Matches)

*   **Ex 3:**
    1. S_max=4, L={(10,7), (10,8), (10,9)}, N=3, S_out=4.
    2. Select top-right from L: Top row is 10. Right-most column is 9. (r*, c*) = (10, 9).
    3. R_out = 10 + floor((4-4)/2) = 10. C_out = 9 + floor((4-4)/2) = 9.
    4. Fill 4x4 @ (10, 9). -> Still does NOT match Expected Output (11, 8).

**Conclusion:** The hypothesis `S_out = N+1` centered relative to the top-rightmost largest white square fits Examples 1 and 2 but fails Example 3's location. The fact that Example 3's target area isn't even white is deeply problematic for any theory based on finding white squares.

Maybe the object finding is wrong. Is there some other object definition?

What if we look for the largest square that is *mostly* white?
Define "mostly white" as > 80% white pixels?
*   Ex 1: Largest is 4x4 @ (3, 5) (100% white). Chosen 2x2 @ (4, 6) (100%).
*   Ex 2: Largest are 5x5 @ (4, 4), (5, 4) (100%). Chosen 3x3 @ (5, 5) (100%).
*   Ex 3: Largest 100% white are 4x4 @ (10, 7/8/9). The chosen area 4x4 @ (11, 8) is 13/16 = 81.25% white. Are there any larger squares with >= 81.25% white?
    *   Check 5x5 squares. e.g., `grid[9:14, 7:12]`? Many non-zeros. Seems unlikely.

This doesn't help select the *correct* square/area.

**Final attempt: Revisit Example 3.**
Input: Largest white squares are 4x4 at (10,7), (10,8), (10,9). N=3.
Output: Fill 4x4 area at (11,8).
The output area (11,8) is directly below the middle of the three largest white squares (10,8). It seems specifically related to (10,8). Why (10,8)? It's the middle one.
If N=3, select the middle square (using column index) from the top-most row of largest white squares. Let this be `(r_mid, c_mid)`.
The output square is placed at `(r_mid + 1, c_mid)` with size `N+1`?
Let's test this specific rule modification for N=3.

Hypothesis v3:
1. Find `S_max` and `L`.
2. `N = |L|`.
3. `S_out = N + 1`.
4. If N=1, select the single square `(r*, c*)` from `L`. Output location is `(r* + floor((S_max-S_out)/2), c* + floor((S_max-S_out)/2))`.
5. If N=2, select the top-right square `(r*, c*)` from `L`. Output location is `(r* + floor((S_max-S_out)/2), c* + floor((S_max-S_out)/2))`.
6. If N=3:
    a. Find all squares in `L` with the minimum row index `r_min`.
    b. Sort these squares by column index. Select the middle one `(r_min, c_mid)`.
    c. Output location is `(r_min + 1, c_mid)`. *(This looks ad-hoc)*
7. Fill `S_out x S_out` area at the calculated output location with azure (8).

Test:
*   Ex 1: N=1. Rule 4 applies. (r*, c*) = (3, 5). S_max=4, S_out=2. R_out = 3+1=4. C_out = 5+1=6. Fill 2x2 @ (4, 6). (Matches)
*   Ex 2: N=2. Rule 5 applies. (r*, c*) = (4, 4). S_max=5, S_out=3. R_out = 4+1=5. C_out = 4+1=5. Fill 3x3 @ (5, 5). (Matches)
*   Ex 3: N=3. Rule 6 applies.
    a. Min row = 10. Squares are (10, 7), (10, 8), (10, 9).
    b. Middle one is (10, 8). So (r_min, c_mid) = (10, 8).
    c. Output location = (10 + 1, 8) = (11, 8). S_out = 3+1=4.
    d. Fill 4x4 @ (11, 8). (Matches!)

This hypothesis fits all three examples, although rule 6c seems arbitrary. But perhaps it's the simplest rule that fits the N=3 case. The key elements are: finding largest white squares, counting them (N), deriving output size (N+1), and finding the location based on N and the positions of the largest white squares (using different selection/adjustment logic for N=1, N=2, N=3).
