Objects:
  - InputGrid: A 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - OutputGrid: A 2D array of pixels, derived from InputGrid.
  - Pixels: Individual cells in the grid, identified by color (0-9).
    - WhitePixel: Color 0.
    - AzurePixel: Color 8.
  - WhiteSquare: A contiguous square subgrid within InputGrid composed entirely of WhitePixels.

Properties:
  - GridDimensions: Height and width of the InputGrid and OutputGrid (they are the same).
  - SquareSize: The side length (N) of a WhiteSquare (N x N).
  - SquareLocation: The top-left coordinates (row, column) of a WhiteSquare.
  - LargestWhiteSquare: The WhiteSquare with the maximum SquareSize found in the InputGrid. If multiple squares share the maximum size, the examples suggest there's only one, or an implicit tie-breaker (likely top-most, then left-most, although not explicitly needed based on examples).

Relationships:
  - OutputGrid is identical to InputGrid, except for the area corresponding to the LargestWhiteSquare.
  - The area of the LargestWhiteSquare in the InputGrid is filled with AzurePixels in the OutputGrid.

Actions:
  - Identify: Scan the InputGrid to find all possible WhiteSquares.
  - Measure: Determine the SquareSize for each WhiteSquare.
  - Compare: Find the maximum SquareSize among all identified WhiteSquares.
  - Locate: Determine the SquareLocation of the WhiteSquare(s) having the maximum SquareSize.
  - Fill: Create the OutputGrid by copying the InputGrid, then changing the pixels within the located LargestWhiteSquare to AzurePixel (color 8).
