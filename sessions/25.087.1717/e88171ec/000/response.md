        *   Example 1: Most frequent color is red (2). Filled square is 2x2.
        *   Example 2: Most frequent color is yellow (4). Filled square is 3x3.
        *   Example 3: Most frequent color is green (3). Filled square is 4x4.
    *   There seems to be a pattern: `square_size = most_frequent_color + X`.
        *   Ex 1: 2 = 2 + X -> X = 0
        *   Ex 2: 3 = 4 + X -> X = -1
        *   Ex 3: 4 = 3 + X -> X = 1
        *   This doesn't seem consistent.
    *   Let's re-examine the square sizes: 2x2, 3x3, 4x4. These are sizes 2, 3, and 4.
    *   The corresponding most frequent colors are 2 (red), 4 (yellow), 3 (green).
    *   Perhaps the size is determined by the *value* of the most frequent non-background color?
        *   Ex 1: Color 2 -> Size 2x2.
        *   Ex 2: Color 4 -> Size 4x4? No, it's 3x3.
        *   Ex 3: Color 3 -> Size 3x3? No, it's 4x4.
    *   What if the size is related to the *number of distinct non-background colors*?
        *   Ex 1: 1 distinct color (red). Size 2x2.
        *   Ex 2: 2 distinct colors (yellow, gray). Size 3x3.
        *   Ex 3: 1 distinct color (green). Size 4x4? This doesn't work.
    *   Let's look at the filled shape again. Is it always a square?
        *   Ex 1: 2x2 white block filled with azure.
        *   Ex 2: 3x3 white block filled with azure.
        *   Ex 3: 4x4 white block filled with azure.
    *   The size of the square to be filled is `N x N`.
    *   Let's check the relationship between the most frequent color (MFC) value and N.
        *   Ex 1: MFC=2, N=2.
        *   Ex 2: MFC=4, N=3.
        *   Ex 3: MFC=3, N=4.
    *   This looks like a potential mapping or sequence:
        *   Color 2 -> Size 2
        *   Color 3 -> Size 4
        *   Color 4 -> Size 3
    *   Could it be related to the order of appearance in the training set? No, that's unlikely for ARC.
    *   Let's assume the rule is: Find the largest square block composed entirely of white (0) pixels. Let the size of this square be `S x S`.
        *   Ex 1: Input has white blocks. What's the largest white square? The filled area `(4:6, 6:8)` is 2x2. Are there larger ones? Let's check visually. Yes, there are larger rectangular white areas, but are there larger *square* white areas? Around `(3:7, 5:11)` there's a large block, but it contains non-white pixels. The 2x2 at `(4:6, 6:8)` looks like a candidate for the largest *purely white* square.
        *   Ex 2: Input has a 3x3 white square at `(5:8, 5:8)`. Are there larger? At `(4:11, 5:9)` there's a large white rectangle, including the 3x3 square. Visually, 3x3 seems the largest white *square*.
        *   Ex 3: Input has a 4x4 white square at `(11:13, 8:12)`. Are there larger? Visually, it seems this is the largest white *square*.
    *   Hypothesis: Find the largest square subgrid composed entirely of white pixels. Fill this square with azure (8) pixels.

*   **Uniqueness:** Is there only one largest white square? If multiple squares of the same maximum size exist, which one is chosen?
    *   In the examples, only one square is filled. It implies there's either only one largest square, or a tie-breaking rule (e.g., top-most, then left-most). Let's assume for now that there's a unique largest white square.

**Refined Hypothesis:**

1.  Identify all possible square subgrids within the input grid.
2.  Filter these squares to keep only those composed entirely of white (0) pixels.
3.  Find the maximum size (`N x N`) among these white squares.
4.  Identify the location (top-left corner coordinates) of the largest white square(s).
5.  If there's only one largest white square, fill its area in the output grid with azure (8) pixels. All other pixels remain unchanged from the input.
6.  (Assumption for now: There will be a unique largest white square in the test cases, or the examples would likely demonstrate a tie-breaker).

**Structuring the Deliverables:**

*   **Perception:** Describe the input/output grids, the colors involved, the core action (filling a shape), the shape (square), the color used for filling (azure), and the criteria for selecting the square (largest, composed of white pixels).
*   **Facts (YAML):**
    *   `Objects`: Input grid, Output grid, White pixel (0), Azure pixel (8), White square subgrids.
    *   `Properties`: Grid dimensions, Pixel color, Square size, Square location, Square composition (all white).
    *   `Relationships`: Output grid is derived from the input grid. Azure pixels in the output correspond to a specific white square in the input.
    *   `Actions`: Identify all square subgrids. Check if a square is all white. Find the maximum size of white squares. Locate the largest white square. Fill the located square area with azure. Copy other pixels.
*   **Natural Language Program:** Formulate the steps clearly based on the refined hypothesis.Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output:** The task takes a grid of pixels (colors 0-9) as input and produces a modified grid of the same dimensions as output.
2.  **Color Palette:** The input examples primarily use white (0) as the background and one or two dominant colors: red (2) in the first, yellow (4) and gray (5) in the second, and green (3) in the third. The output introduces azure (8).
3.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental change between input and output is the appearance of a solid block of azure (8) pixels in the output grid. This block replaces an area that was composed entirely of white (0) pixels in the input grid.
4.  **Shape:** The area being filled with azure (8) is always a square.
5.  **Location and Size:** The location and size of the azure square vary between examples.
    *   Example 1: A 2x2 azure square appears.
    *   Example 2: A 3x3 azure square appears.
    *   Example 3: A 4x4 azure square appears.
6.  **Identifying the Target Area:** The key seems to be identifying the *correct* square region of white (0) pixels in the input grid to fill. Observing the examples, the filled square corresponds to the largest possible square subgrid composed *exclusively* of white (0) pixels within the input grid.
7.  **Constancy:** All pixels *outside* this largest white square remain unchanged between the input and output grids.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - InputGrid: A 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - OutputGrid: A 2D array of pixels, derived from InputGrid.
  - Pixels: Individual cells in the grid, identified by color (0-9).
    - WhitePixel: Color 0.
    - AzurePixel: Color 8.
  - WhiteSquare: A contiguous square subgrid within InputGrid composed entirely of WhitePixels.

Properties:
  - GridDimensions: Height and width of the InputGrid and OutputGrid (they are the same).
  - SquareSize: The side length (N) of a WhiteSquare (N x N).
  - SquareLocation: The top-left coordinates (row, column) of a WhiteSquare.
  - LargestWhiteSquare: The WhiteSquare with the maximum SquareSize found in the InputGrid. If multiple squares share the maximum size, the examples suggest there's only one, or an implicit tie-breaker (likely top-most, then left-most, although not explicitly needed based on examples).

Relationships:
  - OutputGrid is identical to InputGrid, except for the area corresponding to the LargestWhiteSquare.
  - The area of the LargestWhiteSquare in the InputGrid is filled with AzurePixels in the OutputGrid.

Actions:
  - Identify: Scan the InputGrid to find all possible WhiteSquares.
  - Measure: Determine the SquareSize for each WhiteSquare.
  - Compare: Find the maximum SquareSize among all identified WhiteSquares.
  - Locate: Determine the SquareLocation of the WhiteSquare(s) having the maximum SquareSize.
  - Fill: Create the OutputGrid by copying the InputGrid, then changing the pixels within the located LargestWhiteSquare to AzurePixel (color 8).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Search the input grid to identify all possible square subgrids composed entirely of white (0) pixels.
3.  Determine the size (side length `N`) of each identified white square.
4.  Find the maximum size (`N_max`) among all the white squares found.
5.  Locate the specific white square(s) that have this maximum size (`N_max`). (Based on the examples, assume there is only one such largest square). Let its top-left corner be at `(row, col)`.
6.  Modify the output grid by replacing the `N_max` by `N_max` block of pixels starting at `(row, col)` with azure (8) pixels.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
