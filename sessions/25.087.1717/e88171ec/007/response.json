Identify the top-left coordinates `(r, c)` of all such `S_max x S_max` white squares. Let this set of coordinates be `L`.\n3.  Count the number of these largest white squares: `N = len(L)`.\n4.  If N is 0, return the input grid unchanged.\n5.  Determine the size of the output square to be filled with azure (8): `S_out = N + 1`.\n6.  Determine the top-left coordinate `(R_out, C_out)` for the output square based on the value of N:\n    a. If N = 1: Let `(r*, c*)` be the single coordinate in `L`. Calculate `R_out = r* + 1` and `C_out = c*`.\n    b. If N = 2: Sort `L` by row index (ascending), then by column index (ascending). Select the first coordinate `(r*, c*)`. Calculate `offset = floor((S_max - S_out) / 2)`. Calculate `R_out = r* + offset` and `C_out = c* + offset`.\n    c. If N = 3: Find all coordinates in `L` that have the minimum row index (`r_min`). Sort these coordinates by their column index (ascending). Select the middle coordinate `(r_min, c_mid)` (at index 1). The output coordinate is `(R_out, C_out) = (r_min + 1, c_mid)`.\n    d. If N > 3: (Assumption based on examples) Return the input grid unchanged.\n7.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n8.  Fill the `S_out x S_out` area starting at `(R_out, C_out)` in the output grid with azure (8), clipping to grid boundaries.\n9.  Return the modified grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_largest_white_squares(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the size of the largest square(s) of white pixels (0)\n    and the top-left coordinates of all such squares.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (max_size, list_of_coords) where max_size is the side length\n               of the largest white square(s), and list_of_coords contains\n               dict {'r': r, 'c': c} for each such square.
