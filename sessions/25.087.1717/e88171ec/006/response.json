This is a 3x3 square.\n\n    Why did the reported \"Transformed Output\" for Example 2 show `output_grid[8, 5:8]` also being filled with 8?\n    Possibility 1: The report's \"Transformed Output\" is incorrect (copied wrong?).\n    Possibility 2: The code execution environment produced that output, meaning `R_out` or `S_out` was different during execution.\n    Possibility 3: The `_find_largest_white_squares` function is wrong. Let's re-check its logic. It looks for *squares*. It checks `np.all(subgrid == 0)`. It finds size 5 squares at (4,4) and (5,4). `grid[4:9, 4:9]` and `grid[5:10, 4:9]`. That seems correct.\n    Possibility 4: The value of N was calculated incorrectly? No, `len([{'r': 4, 'c': 4}, {'r': 5, 'c': 4}])` is 2.\n    Possibility 5: The calculation `S_out = N + 1` is wrong? For N=2, S_out=3. Matches expected.\n    Possibility 6: The offset calculation or coordinate selection for N=2 is wrong? The code chose (r*,c*)=(4,4) and offset=1, giving (R,C)=(5,5). This matches the *expected* output's top-left corner.\n\n    Let's assume the reported \"Transformed Output\" for Example 2 is misleading/incorrect, and the code *should* have produced the correct output based on its logic. If so, the code logic for N=1 and N=2 appears correct in terms of placement *location* (top-left corner) and *size*, but the N=1 placement calculation seems different from what's needed for Example 1's expected output.\n\n    Revisiting N=1 Rule based on Example 1 Expected Output:\n    (r, c) = (3, 6), S_max = 4 -> (R_out, C_out) = (4, 6), S_out = 2.\n    Rule: `R_out = r + 1`, `C_out = c`.\n\n    Revisiting N=2 Rule based on Example 2 Expected Output:\n    L = [{'r': 4, 'c': 4}, {'r': 5, 'c': 4}], S_max = 5.\n    Select (r*, c*) = (4, 4) (top-most, using code's sort).\n    Output: (R_out, C_out) = (5, 5), S_out = 3.\n    Rule: `R_out = r* + 1` (4+1=5), `C_out = c* + 1` (4+1=5). This seems different from N=1.\n\n    Let's try the N=1 \"centering\" rule from the code again: `offset = floor((S_max - S_out) / 2)`. `R_out = r* + offset`, `C_out = c* + offset`.\n    Ex1: S_max=4, S_out=2. offset=1. (r*, c*)=(3, 6). -> (R, C) = (3+1, 6+1) = (4, 7). Expected (4, 6). Fails.\n    Ex2: S_max=5, S_out=3. offset=1. (r*, c*)=(4, 4). -> (R, C) = (4+1, 4+1) = (5, 5). Expected (5, 5). Matches.\n\n    This suggests the centering logic `offset = floor((S_max - S_out) / 2); R_out = r*+offset; C_out = c*+offset` works for N=2 but not N=1.\n\n    What is the rule for N=1 then, if it needs to get (4, 6) from (3, 6) with S_max=4, S_out=2?\n    (R_out, C_out) = (r* + 1, c* + 0)?\n    Or maybe the selected white square for N=1 was wrong? No, only one.\n\n    Let's reconsider Example 1. Is it possible S_max is actually 5?\n    Looking around (3,6):\n    "

The expected output IS a 4x4 azure square at (11, 8).\n        The Transformed Output (from report) IS ALSO a 4x4 azure square at (11, 8).\n        Why does the report say \"Match: False\", \"Pixels Off: 8\"? This is very confusing.\n\n        Let's assume the report's comparison result (\"Match: False\", \"Pixels Off: 8\") is WRONG for Example 3, just like the match status seemed wrong for Example 1.\n        Let's assume the code *did* produce the correct output for Example 3 based on its logic.\n\n        So, the N=3 logic seems correct:\n        Rule for N=3: Find white squares in min row (`r_min`). Sort by col. Select middle one `(r_min, c_mid)`. `R_out = r_min + 1`, `C_out = c_mid`.\n\n**Summary of Revised Rules:**\n*   Find largest white square size `S_max` and locations `L`.\n*   `N = len(L)`. If N=0, return input.\n*   `S_out = N + 1`.\n*   If N=1:\n    *   `(r*, c*) = L[0]`.\n    *   `R_out = r* + 1`.\n    *   `C_out = c*`.\n*   If N=2:\n    *   Sort L by row (asc), then col (desc is arbitrary, maybe asc?). Let's stick with the previous code's choice: row asc, col desc. Select the first `(r*, c*)`.\n    *   `offset = floor((S_max - S_out) / 2)`.\n    *   `R_out = r* + offset`.\n    *   `C_out = c* + offset`.\n*   If N=3:\n    *   Find squares in `min_r`. Sort by `col`. Select middle `(r_min, c_mid)`.\n    *   `R_out = r_min + 1`.\n    *   `C_out = c_mid`.\n*   Fill `S_out x S_out` square at `(R_out, C_out)` with azure (8).\n\n**Potential Issues / Refinements:**\n*   The N=2 sorting rule (row asc, col desc) was based on the previous attempt. Does row asc, col asc work just as well? In Ex2, L=[(4,4), (5,4)]. Row asc gives (4,4) first. Col doesn't matter. So it selects (4,4) either way. Let's make it simpler: sort by row (asc), then col (asc).\n*   The discrepancy between the reported results (Match=T/F, Pixels Off) and the actual outputs shown suggests an issue in the evaluation script or the reporting process used previously. I should proceed based on my analysis of the *expected* vs *calculated* outputs based on the revised rules.\n\n**Final Check of Rules:**\n*   Ex1: N=1. (r*,c*)=(3,6). S_max=4. S_out=2. Rule -> R=3+1=4, C=6. Fills [4:6, 6:8]. Correct.\n*   Ex2: N=2. L=[(4,4), (5,4)]. S_max=5. S_out=3. Sort -> (r*,c*)=(4,4). Rule -> offset=floor((5-3)/2)=1. R=4+1=5, C=4+1=5. Fills [5:8, 5:8]. Correct.\n*   Ex3: N=3. L=[(10,7), (10,8), (10,9)]. S_max=4. S_out=4. Sort/Select middle -> (r_min, c_mid)=(10, 8). Rule -> R=10+1=11, C=8. Fills [11:15, 8:12]. Correct.\n\nThe revised rules seem consistent with all three examples.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully implemented the core idea of finding the largest white squares but failed to generalize the placement logic for the output azure square across all examples.\n- Example 1: The report claimed a match, but detailed analysis suggests the code's centering logic `C_out = c* + offset` would have placed the square incorrectly compared to the expected output. The expected output requires a placement rule of `R_out = r* + 1`, `C_out = c*`.\n- Example 2: The report claimed a mismatch (\"Pixels Off: 3\"), but analysis of the code's logic (`offset = floor((S_max - S_out) / 2)`, `R_out = r* + offset`, `C_out = c* + offset`) correctly predicts the *expected* output's size and location. The reported \"Transformed Output\" likely contained an error or artifact.\n- Example 3: The report claimed a mismatch (\"Pixels Off: 8\"), but analysis shows the code's N=3 logic (`R_out = r_min + 1`, `C_out = c_mid`) correctly predicts the *expected* output's size and location. The reported comparison result seems incorrect.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the natural language program by defining distinct placement rules for N=1, N=2, and N=3 based on the successful logic derived from analyzing the expected outputs. We will trust the analysis of the *expected* outputs over the potentially flawed comparison results reported previously.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\n| Example | Input Size | S_max | L (Top-Left Coords)                    | N | S_out | (r*, c*) Selected | Expected (R_out, C_out) | Rule Derivation                                                                                                 |\n| :------ | :--------- | :---- | :------------------------------------- | :- | :---- | :---------------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | 15x15      | 4     | `[{'r': 3, 'c': 6}]`                    | 1 | 2     | (3, 6)            | (4, 6)                    | `R = r* + 1`, `C = c*`                                                                                          |\n| 2       | 19x19      | 5     | `[{'r': 4, 'c': 4}, {'r': 5, 'c': 4}]` | 2 | 3     | (4, 4) (Top-most) | (5, 5)                    | `offset = floor((5-3)/2) = 1`. `R = r* + offset = 4+1=5`, `C = c* + offset = 4+1=5`.
