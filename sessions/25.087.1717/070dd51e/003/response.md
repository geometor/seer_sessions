"""
Connect pairs of same-colored pixels in the input grid by drawing a straight 
line (horizontal or vertical) between them using their color. Lines are drawn 
first horizontally, then vertically, so that vertical lines overwrite 
horizontal lines at intersection points.

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid and group them by color, 
    storing their coordinates.
3.  Create two lists: one for pairs defining horizontal lines and one for 
    pairs defining vertical lines.
4.  Iterate through each color group:
    *   If a group contains exactly two pixels:
        *   Determine the coordinates (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) of the pair.
        *   If r1 == r2 (horizontal), add the pair (coordinates, color) to the 
            horizontal lines list.
        *   If c1 == c2 (vertical), add the pair (coordinates, color) to the 
            vertical lines list.
5.  Process the horizontal lines list:
    *   For each horizontal pair ((r1, c1), (r2, c2)) and its color:
        *   Fill the pixels on the output grid from (r1, min(c1, c2)) to 
            (r1, max(c1, c2)) inclusive with the pair's color.
6.  Process the vertical lines list:
    *   For each vertical pair ((r1, c1), (r2, c2)) and its color:
        *   Fill the pixels on the output grid from (min(r1, r2), c1) to 
            (max(r1, r2), c1) inclusive with the pair's color. This step 
            overwrites any color previously placed by horizontal lines at 
            intersection points.
7.  Return the final output grid.
