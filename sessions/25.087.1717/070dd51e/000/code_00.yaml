task_elements:
  - element: grid
    attributes: [input, output]
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
      contains_pixels: True
  - element: pixel
    attributes: [colored, background]
    properties:
      color: [yellow, green, orange, maroon, azure, red, magenta, gray]
      position: (row, column)
  - element: pixel_pair
    description: Two pixels of the same color in the input grid.
    properties:
      color: Same non-white color for both pixels.
      alignment: [horizontal, vertical]
      coordinates: [(r1, c1), (r2, c2)]
    relationships:
      horizontal: r1 == r2
      vertical: c1 == c2
actions:
  - action: find_pairs
    description: Identify pairs of pixels with the same non-white color in the input grid.
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [list_of_pixel_pairs]
  - action: determine_alignment
    description: For each pair, determine if they are aligned horizontally or vertically.
    inputs: [pixel_pair]
    outputs: [alignment_type]
  - action: fill_line
    description: Fill the pixels on the straight line segment between the paired pixels (inclusive) with their color.
    inputs: [pixel_pair, alignment_type, output_grid (initially copy of input)]
    outputs: [modified_output_grid]
    details:
      horizontal_fill: Change color of pixels at (r1, c) for c from min(c1, c2) to max(c1, c2).
      vertical_fill: Change color of pixels at (r, c1) for r from min(r1, r2) to max(r1, r2).
transformation_goal:
  Connect pairs of same-colored pixels in the input grid by drawing a straight line (horizontal or vertical) between them using their color.
