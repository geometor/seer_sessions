**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** Contains a white background (color 0) with sparsely placed single pixels of various colors.
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid retains the original colored pixels from the input. Additionally, lines are drawn connecting pairs of pixels of the same color.
3.  **Objects:** The primary objects are pairs of pixels sharing the same color.
4.  **Relationships:** The relationship between paired pixels is either horizontal (same row, different columns) or vertical (same column, different rows).
5.  **Action:** The action is to fill the straight line segment (horizontally or vertically) between the identified pairs of pixels with their corresponding color.

**YAML Facts:**

    properties:
      color: [yellow, green, orange, maroon, azure, red, magenta, gray]
      position: (row, column)
  - element: pixel_pair
    description: Two pixels of the same color in the input grid.
    properties:
      color: Same non-white color for both pixels.
      alignment: [horizontal, vertical]
      coordinates: [(r1, c1), (r2, c2)]
    relationships:
      horizontal: r1 == r2
      vertical: c1 == c2
actions:
  - action: find_pairs
    description: Identify pairs of pixels with the same non-white color in the input grid.
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [list_of_pixel_pairs]
  - action: determine_alignment
    description: For each pair, determine if they are aligned horizontally or vertically.
    inputs: [pixel_pair]
    outputs: [alignment_type]
  - action: fill_line
    description: Fill the pixels on the straight line segment between the paired pixels (inclusive) with their color.
    inputs: [pixel_pair, alignment_type, output_grid (initially copy of input)]
    outputs: [modified_output_grid]
    details:
      horizontal_fill: Change color of pixels at (r1, c) for c from min(c1, c2) to max(c1, c2).
      vertical_fill: Change color of pixels at (r, c1) for r from min(r1, r2) to max(r1, r2).
transformation_goal:
  Connect pairs of same-colored pixels in the input grid by drawing a straight line (horizontal or vertical) between them using their color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid and group them by their color.
3.  Iterate through each color group.
4.  If a color group contains exactly two pixels:
    a.  Let the coordinates of the two pixels be (r1, c1) and (r2, c2).
    b.  Check if the pixels are horizontally aligned (i.e., r1 equals r2). If they are, iterate through the columns from the minimum column index (min(c1, c2)) to the maximum column index (max(c1, c2)), inclusive. For each column index `c` in this range, set the color of the pixel at (r1, c) in the output grid to the color of the pair.
    c.  Check if the pixels are vertically aligned (i.e., c1 equals c2). If they are, iterate through the rows from the minimum row index (min(r1, r2)) to the maximum row index (max(r1, r2)), inclusive. For each row index `r` in this range, set the color of the pixel at (r, c1) in the output grid to the color of the pair.
5.  Return the final modified output grid.
