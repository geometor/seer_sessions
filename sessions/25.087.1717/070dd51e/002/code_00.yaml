task_description: Connect pairs of same-colored pixels with lines.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - size: variable (up to 30x30)

objects:
  - type: colored pixels (non-white)
  - structure: appear in pairs of the same color.

relationships:
  - each pair defines either a perfectly horizontal or a perfectly vertical alignment.

actions:
  - identify_pairs: Find all pairs of non-white pixels sharing the same color.
  - draw_lines: For each identified pair:
      - determine if the alignment is horizontal or vertical.
      - draw a straight line segment connecting the pair using their color.
      - start with a copy of the input grid.
  - handle_intersections:
      - rule: If a horizontal line and a vertical line cross, the pixel at the intersection point must take the color of the **vertical** line.

output:
  - The modified grid containing the original colored pixels plus the newly drawn lines, with intersections resolved according to the rule.
