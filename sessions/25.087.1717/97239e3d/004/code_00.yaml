task_context:
  grid_structure: Input and output grids have an underlying structure based on 4x4 cells. Cell boundaries occur at indices 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, ...
  background_color: White (0) is the primary background color.
  ignored_color: Azure (8) seems to be part of the grid structure/pattern but is ignored during the transformation (neither a marker nor filled).
  marker_colors: Any color other than White (0) or Azure (8) acts as a marker.

objects:
  - object: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel in the input grid whose color is not White (0) or Azure (8).
    properties:
      - location: (row, column) coordinates.
      - color: The specific color value (1-7, 9).
      - associated_cell: The 4x4 grid cell containing the marker pixel. The cell's top-left corner is (row // 4 * 4, col // 4 * 4).

actions:
  - action: identify_markers
    description: Scan the input grid to find all marker pixels.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list of marker pixels with their location and color.

  - action: determine_target_cell
    description: For each marker pixel, determine the 4x4 grid cell it belongs to.
    inputs: marker_pixel location (row, col)
    outputs: cell boundaries (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col), where min_row = row // 4 * 4, max_row = min_row + 3, min_col = col // 4 * 4, max_col = min_col + 3.

  - action: fill_cell
    description: For each identified target cell associated with a marker, fill the White (0) pixels within that cell in the output grid with the marker's color.
    inputs:
      - output_grid (initialized as a copy of input_grid)
      - target_cell_boundaries
      - marker_color
      - input_grid (to check for original white pixels)
    outputs: modified output_grid

process_flow:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Identify all marker pixels in the input grid.
  - step: For each marker pixel found:
      - Determine the 4x4 cell it resides in.
      - Iterate through all pixels within that 4x4 cell's boundaries.
      - If a pixel within the cell is White (0) in the *input* grid, change its color in the *output* grid to the marker's color.
  - step: Return the final output grid.
