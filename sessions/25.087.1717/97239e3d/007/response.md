"""
Transforms the input grid based on 'marker' pixels and a 4x4 grid structure.
1. Identify all 'marker' pixels (not white 0, not azure 8).
2. Group the locations of these markers by their color.
3. For each marker color group:
    a. Determine the 4x4 grid cells containing these markers.
    b. Find the bounding box of these *cells*.
    c. Convert the cell bounding box to a pixel bounding box region.
    d. Fill all pixels within this pixel bounding box in the output grid with the marker color, *only if* the corresponding pixel in the original input grid was white (0).
4. The output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid. Non-white pixels within the bounding box retain their original color.
