Data:
  - Grid Structure: Input and output grids are the same size. The input contains a visible structure of 4x4 cells separated or defined by white (0) and azure (8) pixels.
  - Objects:
      - Background: White (0) pixels.
      - Grid Lines/Separators: Azure (8) pixels, often forming partial 4x4 outlines.
      - Markers: Pixels with colors other than white (0) or azure (8). Multiple markers of the same color can exist.
Properties:
  - Marker Location: Each marker exists at a specific row and column (r, c).
  - Marker Cell: Each marker belongs to a conceptual 4x4 grid cell, determined by `cell_r = r // 4`, `cell_c = c // 4`.
  - Marker Color Group: Markers are grouped by their color.
  - Bounding Box: For each color group, there's a bounding box defined by the minimum and maximum row/column indices of the *cells* containing the markers of that color.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all marker pixels.
  - Group: Group markers by their color.
  - Calculate Bounding Box: For each color group, determine the bounding box of the 4x4 cells occupied by its markers. Convert cell indices to pixel indices for the final bounding box region (e.g., rows `min_cell_r * 4` to `(max_cell_r + 1) * 4`, cols `min_cell_c * 4` to `(max_cell_c + 1) * 4`, adjusting for grid boundaries).
  - Fill: Create the output grid by copying the input grid. Then, for each color group's calculated pixel bounding box, iterate through all pixels within that box. If a pixel `(r, c)` within the box corresponds to a white (0) pixel in the *original input grid*, change the color of that pixel in the *output grid* to the marker color of the group. This fill operation is done independently for each color group, potentially overwriting fills from other groups if their bounding boxes overlap, although no overlaps occur in the examples. The original non-white pixels within the box remain unchanged.
