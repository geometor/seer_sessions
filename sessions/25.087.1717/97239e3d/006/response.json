            "text": "The metrics confirm the hypothesis: find markers, group by color, determine the bounding box of the 4x4 *cells* containing the markers for each color, and fill the originally white pixels within that bounding box (clipped to grid dimensions) with the marker color. The number of white pixels calculated within these bounding boxes visually corresponds well with the filled areas in the expected outputs.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the concept of \"marker\" pixels (non-white, non-azure) and the significance of a 4x4 grid structure hinted at by the azure (8) pixels. However, it failed because it treated each marker independently, filling only the white pixels within the single 4x4 cell containing that marker.\n\nThe analysis of the failed examples reveals a more complex interaction:\n1.  Markers of the *same* color work together.\n2.  The area affected by a group of same-colored markers is determined by the bounding box of the 4x4 cells they occupy.\n3.  All pixels within this bounding box region that were *originally white (0)* are changed to the marker color in the output.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is to:\n1.  Identify all marker pixels and group them by color.\n2.  For each color group, determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the 4x4 *cells* containing these markers.\n3.  Calculate the pixel coordinates of the bounding box defined by these minimum/maximum cell indices.\n4.  Create the output grid (initially a copy of the input).\n5.  Iterate through each color group's bounding box. For every pixel `(r, c)` inside the box, if the corresponding pixel in the *original input grid* `input_grid[r, c]` was white (0), update the `output_grid[r, c]` to the marker color.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the `tool_code` execution:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid Shape: (17, 17)\n*   Markers:\n    *   Magenta (6): (1, 4) [Cell (0, 1)], (4, 16) [Cell (1, 4)]\n    *   Blue (1): (13, 8) [Cell (3, 2)], (16, 0) [Cell (4, 0)]\n*   Bounding Boxes (Pixel Coordinates):\n    *   Magenta (6): Rows 0-7, Cols 4-16 (ends at col index 16 as grid width is 17)\n    *   Blue (1): Rows 12-16 (ends at row index 16 as grid height is 17), Cols 0-11\n*   White Pixels to Fill:\n    *   Magenta (6): 54\n    *   Blue (1): 34\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid Shape: (17, 17)\n*   Markers:\n    *   Red (2): (0, 0) [Cell (0, 0)], (8, 12) [Cell (2, 3)]\n*   Bounding Boxes (Pixel Coordinates):\n    *   Red (2): Rows 0-11, Cols 0-15\n*   White Pixels to Fill:\n    *   Red (2): 94\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Grid Shape: (17, 17)\n*   Markers:\n    *   Orange (7): (0, 12) [Cell (0, 3)], (3, 16) [Cell (0, 4)]\n    *   Green (3): (8, 1) [Cell (2, 0)], (12, 11) [Cell (3, 2)]\n*   Bounding Boxes (Pixel Coordinates):\n    *   Orange (7): Rows 0-3, Cols 12-16\n    *   Green (3): Rows 8-15, Cols 0-11\n*   White Pixels to Fill:\n    *   Orange (7): 10\n    *   Green (3): 46\n\nThese metrics align with the visual inspection of the expected outputs and support the refined hypothesis.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

The input contains a visible structure of 4x4 cells separated or defined by white (0) and azure (8) pixels.\n  - Objects:\n      - Background: White (0) pixels.\n      - Grid Lines/Separators: Azure (8) pixels, often forming partial 4x4 outlines.\n      - Markers: Pixels with colors other than white (0) or azure (8). Multiple markers of the same color can exist.\nProperties:\n  - Marker Location: Each marker exists at a specific row and column (r, c).\n  - Marker Cell: Each marker belongs to a conceptual 4x4 grid cell, determined by `cell_r = r // 4`, `cell_c = c // 4`.\n  - Marker Color Group: Markers are grouped by their color.\n  - Bounding Box: For each color group, there's a bounding box defined by the minimum and maximum row/column indices of the *cells* containing the markers of that color.\nActions:\n  - Identify: Locate all marker pixels.\n  - Group: Group markers by their color.\n  - Calculate Bounding Box: For each color group, determine the bounding box of the 4x4 cells occupied by its markers. Convert cell indices to pixel indices for the final bounding box region (e.g., rows `min_cell_r * 4` to `(max_cell_r + 1) * 4`, cols `min_cell_c * 4` to `(max_cell_c + 1) * 4`, adjusting for grid boundaries).\n  - Fill: Create the output grid by copying the input grid. Then, for each color group's calculated pixel bounding box, iterate through all pixels within that box. If a pixel `(r, c)` within the box corresponds to a white (0) pixel in the *original input grid*, change the color of that pixel in the *output grid* to the marker color of the group. This fill operation is done independently for each color group, potentially overwriting fills from other groups if their bounding boxes overlap, although no overlaps occur in the examples. The original non-white pixels within the box remain unchanged.\n```"
