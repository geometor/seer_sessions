**General Assessment**

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying "marker" pixels (non-white, non-azure), calculating a bounding box encompassing all markers of the same color, expanding this box to align with a 4x4 grid structure, and then filling white pixels within the expanded box.

The results show that this approach is incorrect. The errors consistently involve filling larger areas than expected, particularly when multiple markers of the same color exist in different 4x4 grid cells. This suggests the bounding box expansion and subsequent filling logic is too broad. The core mistake seems to be aggregating all markers of a color into one bounding box calculation, rather than considering the effect of each marker individually within its local grid context.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to revise the transformation rule to focus on the *individual* 4x4 grid cell containing each marker pixel. Instead of expanding a bounding box, the rule should identify the specific 4x4 cell a marker resides in and fill the white pixels *only within that cell* with the marker's color.

**Gather Metrics**

Let's analyze the relationship between marker locations and the filled areas in the expected outputs, confirming the 4x4 cell structure. We'll use the concept of a grid divided into 4x4 cells, starting at indices (0,0), (0,4), (0,8), ..., (4,0), (4,4), etc.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Grid Size: 17x17
    *   Markers: Magenta (6) at (1, 4) and (4, 16); Blue (1) at (13, 8) and (16, 0).
    *   4x4 Cells containing markers:
        *   (1, 4) is in cell starting at (0, 4). Expected output fills white pixels in rows 0-3, cols 4-7 with Magenta.
        *   (4, 16) is in cell starting at (4, 16). Expected output fills white pixels in rows 4-7, cols 16-16 with Magenta.
        *   (13, 8) is in cell starting at (12, 8). Expected output fills white pixels in rows 12-15, cols 8-11 with Blue.
        *   (16, 0) is in cell starting at (16, 0). Expected output fills white pixels in rows 16-16, cols 0-3 with Blue.
    *   Code Output Mismatch: The code's bounding box for Magenta (rows 1-4, cols 4-16) expanded to (rows 0-4, cols 4-16), filling a large incorrect area. Similarly for Blue (rows 13-16, cols 0-8) expanded to (rows 12-16, cols 0-8). The error arises from combining markers into one bounding box before expansion/filling.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Grid Size: 17x17
    *   Markers: Red (2) at (0, 0) and (8, 12).
    *   4x4 Cells containing markers:
        *   (0, 0) is in cell starting at (0, 0). Expected output fills white pixels in rows 0-3, cols 0-3 with Red.
        *   (8, 12) is in cell starting at (8, 12). Expected output fills white pixels in rows 8-11, cols 12-15 with Red.
    *   Code Output Mismatch: The code's bounding box (rows 0-8, cols 0-12) expanded to (rows 0-8, cols 0-12), incorrectly filling the space between the two actual target cells.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Grid Size: 17x17
    *   Markers: Orange (7) at (0, 12) and (3, 16); Green (3) at (8, 1) and (12, 11).
    *   4x4 Cells containing markers:
        *   (0, 12) is in cell starting at (0, 12). Expected output fills white pixels in rows 0-3, cols 12-15 with Orange.
        *   (3, 16) is in cell starting at (0, 16). Expected output fills white pixels in rows 0-3, cols 16-16 with Orange.
        *   (8, 1) is in cell starting at (8, 0). Expected output fills white pixels in rows 8-11, cols 0-3 with Green.
        *   (12, 11) is in cell starting at (12, 8). Expected output fills white pixels in rows 12-15, cols 8-11 with Green.
    *   Code Output Mismatch: The code handled Orange correctly because both markers fell within the same expanded row range (0-3) and the columns (12-16) encompassed both target cells. However, for Green, the bounding box (rows 8-12, cols 1-11) expanded to (rows 8-12, cols 0-11), incorrectly filling cells between the two target Green cells.

**Observations:** The consistent pattern is that each marker pixel "activates" the 4x4 grid cell it belongs to. The transformation involves filling the white pixels *only within* that specific 4x4 cell with the marker's color. The azure (8) pixels act as dividers or structure but are not affected, nor are they markers. White (0) is the background color to be filled.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
task_context:
  grid_structure: Input and output grids have an underlying structure based on 4x4 cells. Cell boundaries occur at indices 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, ...
  background_color: White (0) is the primary background color.
  ignored_color: Azure (8) seems to be part of the grid structure/pattern but is ignored during the transformation (neither a marker nor filled).
  marker_colors: Any color other than White (0) or Azure (8) acts as a marker.

  - object: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel in the input grid whose color is not White (0) or Azure (8).
    properties:
      - location: (row, column) coordinates.
      - color: The specific color value (1-7, 9).
      - associated_cell: The 4x4 grid cell containing the marker pixel. The cell's top-left corner is (row // 4 * 4, col // 4 * 4).

  - action: fill_cell
    description: For each identified target cell associated with a marker, fill the White (0) pixels within that cell in the output grid with the marker's color.

      - target_cell_boundaries
      - marker_color
      - input_grid (to check for original white pixels)
    outputs: modified output_grid

process_flow:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Identify all marker pixels in the input grid.
  - step: For each marker pixel found:
      - Determine the 4x4 cell it resides in.
      - Iterate through all pixels within that 4x4 cell's boundaries.
      - If a pixel within the cell is White (0) in the *input* grid, change its color in the *output* grid to the marker's color.
  - step: Return the final output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.
3.  Check the color of the pixel `input_grid[r, c]`. If the color is White (0) or Azure (8), ignore it and continue to the next pixel.
4.  If the pixel's color is a "marker color" (any color other than White or Azure):
    a.  Identify the 4x4 grid cell that contains this pixel. The cell spans rows from `(r // 4) * 4` to `(r // 4) * 4 + 3` and columns from `(c // 4) * 4` to `(c // 4) * 4 + 3`. Let the marker color be `M`.
    b.  Iterate through all coordinates `(i, j)` within this identified 4x4 cell (i.e., `(r // 4) * 4 <= i <= (r // 4) * 4 + 3` and `(c // 4) * 4 <= j <= (c // 4) * 4 + 3`).
    c.  For each coordinate `(i, j)` within the cell, check if the pixel at `input_grid[i, j]` is White (0).
    d.  If `input_grid[i, j]` is White (0), update the corresponding pixel in the output grid: set `output_grid[i, j]` to the marker color `M`.
5.  After checking all pixels in the input grid, return the modified output grid.
