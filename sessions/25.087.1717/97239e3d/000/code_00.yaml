objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - structure_color: azure (8)
      - structure_pattern: repeating 3x3 blocks separated by white lines
      - marker_pixels:
          - color: non-white, non-azure (e.g., blue, red, magenta, green, orange)
          - location: typically on white lines/boundaries
rectangles:
  - definition_rule:
      - type: bounding_box
        condition: defined by two or more marker pixels of the same color
        details: uses min/max row and column of the marker pixels
      - type: single_marker_rule
        condition: defined by exactly one marker pixel of a given color (r, c)
        details: uses pixel (r, c) and grid structure (e.g., row 0 and first major column line <= c) to define corners. Example suggests rows=[0, r], cols=[first_positive_major_col, c] (where major cols are multiples of 4).
  - color: determined by the color of the defining marker pixel(s)
actions:
  - action: find_marker_pixels
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list of marker pixels with their colors and locations
  - action: group_markers_by_color
    inputs: list of marker pixels
    outputs: groups of marker pixels, one group per color
  - action: define_rectangles
    inputs: groups of marker pixels
    outputs: list of rectangles, each with associated color and row/column bounds
    rule: Apply bounding_box rule for groups >= 2 pixels, single_marker_rule for groups == 1 pixel.
  - action: fill_rectangles
    inputs: input_grid, list of rectangles
    outputs: output_grid
    rule: For each rectangle, iterate through its cells. If an input cell within the rectangle is white (0), change the corresponding output cell to the rectangle's color. Otherwise, keep the input cell's color.
relationships:
  - marker pixel color determines the fill color of the corresponding rectangle.
  - marker pixel location(s) determine the bounds of the corresponding rectangle.
  - only white pixels within the defined rectangles are affected by the transformation.
