            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids have a consistent background structure. They are predominantly filled with `white` (0) and `azure` (8). The `azure` pixels form repeating 3x3 block patterns (like hollow squares or the number 8) separated by single lines of `white` pixels. These white lines create a larger grid-like structure, often with divisions at indices that are multiples of 4 (e.g., rows/cols 4, 8, 12).\n2.  **Marker Pixels:** Each input grid contains a small number of 'marker' pixels with colors other than `white` (0) or `azure` (8). These marker pixels appear on the `white` background lines or grid boundaries. Examples use `magenta` (6), `blue` (1), `red` (2), `orange` (7), `green` (3).\n3.  **Output Transformation:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that certain rectangular areas have their `white` (0) pixels replaced by the color of the marker pixels. The original `azure` (8) pixels and the marker pixels themselves remain unchanged.\n4.  **Rectangle Definition:** The key transformation is the definition and coloring of these rectangles.\n    *   **Pairs of Markers:** If there are two (or more) marker pixels of the *same color*, they define the bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column) of the rectangle to be filled with that color. (See `train_1` blue, `train_2` red, `train_3` orange, `train_3` green).\n    *   **Single Markers:** If there is only *one* marker pixel of a given color, it defines a rectangle differently. In `train_1`, the single `magenta` (6) pixel at `(4, 16)` defines a rectangle spanning rows `[0, 4]` and columns `[4, 16]`. This suggests the single pixel `(r, c)` defines the bottom-right corner `(r, c)`, the top row is 0, and the left column is determined by a structural feature (here, column 4, which is the first major vertical grid line).\n5.  **Filling Rule:** Within the boundaries of a defined rectangle, only the pixels that were originally `white` (0) in the input grid are changed to the corresponding marker color in the output grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Record the color and `(row, column)` coordinates of each identified marker pixel.\n3.  **Group Markers:** Group the identified marker pixels based on their color.\n4.  **Define and Fill Rectangles (for each color group):**\n    a.  Select a color group (all marker pixels of a specific color `C`).\n    b.  **Determine Rectangle Bounds:**\n        i.  **If the group contains exactly one marker pixel at `(r, c)`:** Define the rectangle's row range as `[0, r]`. Determine the smallest positive major column index `first_pos_major_c` (which is 4 in the examples, assuming major columns are multiples of 4). Define the rectangle's column range as `[min(first_pos_major_c, c), max(first_pos_major_c, c)]`.\n        ii. **If the group contains two or more marker pixels:** Find the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`) among all marker pixels in this group. Define the rectangle's row range as `[min_r, max_r]` and column range as `[min_c, max_c]`.\n    c.  **Fill the Rectangle:** Iterate through every cell `(i, j)` within the determined row and column ranges. If the color of the cell `(i, j)` in the *original input grid* is `white` (0), update the color of the cell `(i, j)` in the *output grid* to the marker color `C`.\n5.  **Finalize:** After processing all color groups, return the modified output grid."
