```python

"""
Transforms the input grid based on identifying a specific pattern and drawing lines.

The transformation rule involves these steps:
1.  Identify two distinct non-white colors in the grid. One color ('shape_color') 
    forms a specific pattern around a central white pixel, and the other 
    ('filler_color') is scattered elsewhere.
2.  Locate the central white pixel (center_row, center_col) which has the 
    'shape_color' directly above it, to its left, and to its right. 
    Specifically, find (r, c) such that grid[r, c] == 0 and 
    grid[r-1, c] == grid[r, c-1] == grid[r, c+1] == shape_color.
3.  Change the color of the central pixel (center_row, center_col) in the output 
    grid to the 'filler_color'.
4.  Starting two rows below the central pixel (from row center_row + 2), draw two 
    vertical lines downwards to the bottom edge of the grid. These lines use the 
    'filler_color'.
5.  The columns for these vertical lines are determined by the columns immediately 
    to the left and right of the central pixel's column (center_col - 1 and 
    center_col + 1).
6.  All other pixels retain their original colors from the input grid.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the transformation.

## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified the core pattern (a white pixel with three neighbors of one color) and the two key colors involved ('shape\_color' and 'filler\_color') in all examples. However, the action performed based on this pattern was inaccurate. The code drew two vertical lines starting two rows below the pattern center, whereas the expected output shows a three-pixel-wide vertical stripe starting one row below the pattern center.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the pattern identification logic remains valid.
2.  Precisely describe the shape (a 3-wide vertical stripe) that needs to be drawn.
3.  Specify the exact starting row and columns for this stripe relative to the identified pattern center.
4.  Update the natural language program to reflect this revised transformation rule.

## Metrics and Analysis

Based on visual comparison between the `Expected Output` and `Transformed Output` for each example:

*   **Pattern Identification:** The code correctly located the central white pixel `(r, c)` and identified the `shape_color` (the color at `(r-1, c)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c+1)`) and the `filler_color` (the other non-white color) in all three examples.
    *   Example 1: Center (7, 7), Shape=Orange(7), Filler=Red(2)
    *   Example 2: Center (7, 9), Shape=Maroon(9), Filler=Azure(8)
    *   Example 3: Center (6, 12), Shape=Yellow(4), Filler=Green(3)
*   **Transformation Step 1 (Center Fill):** The code correctly changed the color of the central white pixel `(r, c)` to the `filler_color` in all examples. This matches the expected outputs.
*   **Transformation Step 2 (Drawing):** This is where the discrepancy lies.
    *   **Expected:** A vertical stripe using the `filler_color` is drawn starting from row `r+1` down to the bottom edge. This stripe occupies columns `c-1`, `c`, and `c+1`.
    *   **Actual (Code):** Two vertical lines using the `filler_color` were drawn starting from row `r+2` down to the bottom edge. These lines occupied columns `c-1` and `c+1` only.
    *   **Error Cause:** The code incorrectly calculated the starting row (`r+2` instead of `r+1`) and omitted the central column (`c`) from the drawing process. The number of differing pixels (`Pixels Off`) reflects the missing central column line and the incorrect starting row for the two side lines across all affected rows.

No specific code execution is required for further metrics at this point, as the error pattern is consistent and clear.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Identifies a specific T-shaped pattern and draws a vertical stripe below it.

grid_properties:
  - size: Variable (e.g., 20x20)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - num_colors: Exactly 3 colors present in input (white + 2 others).

objects:
  - object_type: pattern_anchor
    description: >
      A T-shaped structure pointing downwards, formed by a single color
      ('shape_color') surrounding a central white pixel.
    properties:
      - shape: T-shape (3 pixels of shape_color)
      - center: A white pixel (r, c)
      - components:
          - pixel at (r-1, c) is shape_color
          - pixel at (r, c-1) is shape_color
          - pixel at (r, c+1) is shape_color
  - object_type: filler_pixels
    description: >
      Scattered pixels of a second non-white color ('filler_color'). Their
      initial positions are irrelevant to the core transformation, except for
      identifying the filler_color itself.
  - object_type: generated_stripe
    description: A vertical stripe added to the output grid.
    properties:
      - color: filler_color
      - width: 3 pixels
      - location: Centered horizontally on the pattern_anchor's center column.
      - vertical_extent: Starts 1 row below the pattern_anchor's center row and extends to the bottom edge.

actions:
  - action: identify_pattern_and_colors
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs:
      - shape_color: The color forming the T-shape.
      - filler_color: The other non-white color present.
      - center_row: Row index of the central white pixel of the pattern.
      - center_col: Column index of the central white pixel of the pattern.
  - action: modify_grid
    inputs: input_grid, shape_color, filler_color, center_row, center_col
    outputs: output_grid
    steps:
      - 1: Create a copy of the input_grid.
      - 2: Change the color of the pixel at (center_row, center_col) to filler_color.
      - 3: Determine the stripe columns: [center_col - 1, center_col, center_col + 1].
      - 4: Determine the stripe start row: center_row + 1.
      - 5: For each row from start_row to the bottom edge of the grid:
           Set the pixels in the stripe columns to filler_color.
      - 6: Return the modified grid.

constraints:
  - Exactly two non-white colors must be present.
  - The T-shaped pattern must exist and be unique.
  - The pattern center is not on the grid edges (top, left, or right), allowing neighbors to be checked.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Key Elements:** Scan the input grid to find the two distinct non-white colors present. One color (`shape_color`) will form a specific pattern, and the other will be the `filler_color`. Also, locate the background color, which is white (0).
2.  **Locate Pattern Anchor:** Find the unique white pixel `(r, c)` such that the pixel directly above it `(r-1, c)`, the pixel to its left `(r, c-1)`, and the pixel to its right `(r, c+1)` are all of the `shape_color`. This white pixel `(r, c)` is the center of the pattern.
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
4.  **Fill Pattern Center:** In the output grid, change the color of the pattern's central pixel `(r, c)` from white to the `filler_color`.
5.  **Draw Vertical Stripe:**
    *   Define the columns for the stripe: `c-1`, `c`, and `c+1`.
    *   Define the starting row for the stripe: `r+1`.
    *   Iterate through each row from the `start_row` down to the last row of the grid.
    *   In each of these rows, change the color of the pixels in the three `stripe_columns` to the `filler_color`.
6.  **Final Output:** The modified grid is the final output.
