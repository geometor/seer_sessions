Identify two distinct non-white colors in the grid. One color ('shape_color') \n    forms a specific pattern around a central white pixel, and the other \n    ('filler_color') is scattered elsewhere.\n2.  Locate the central white pixel (center_row, center_col) which has the \n    'shape_color' directly above it, to its left, and to its right. \n    Specifically, find (r, c) such that grid[r, c] == 0 and \n    grid[r-1, c] == grid[r, c-1] == grid[r, c+1] == shape_color.\n3.  Change the color of the central pixel (center_row, center_col) in the output \n    grid to the 'filler_color'.\n4.  Starting two rows below the central pixel (from row center_row + 2), draw two \n    vertical lines downwards to the bottom edge of the grid. These lines use the \n    'filler_color'.\n5.  The columns for these vertical lines are determined by the columns immediately \n    to the left and right of the central pixel's column (center_col - 1 and \n    center_col + 1).\n6.
