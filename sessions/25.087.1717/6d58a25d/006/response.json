            "text": "Ah, my manual identification was slightly off. Let's re-evaluate based on the code's findings.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Shape color: orange (7)\n    *   Filler color: red (2)\n    *   Pattern center (r, c): (7, 7) (Input[7, 7] is white, Input[6, 7], Input[7, 6], Input[7, 8] are orange)\n    *   Expected Output vs Transformed Output:\n        *   Expected has a red line down column 7, starting from row 8.\n        *   Expected has red pixels at (8, 6) and (8, 8).\n        *   Transformed has a 3-wide red stripe (columns 6, 7, 8) starting from row 8.\n        *   Difference: Transformed incorrectly fills columns 6 and 8 from row 9 downwards.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Shape color: maroon (9)\n    *   Filler color: azure (8)\n    *   Pattern center (r, c): (7, 9) (Input[7, 9] is white, Input[6, 9], Input[7, 8], Input[7, 10] are maroon)\n    *   Expected Output vs Transformed Output:\n        *   Expected has an azure line down column 9, starting from row 8.\n        *   Expected has azure pixels at (8, 8) and (8, 10).\n        *   Transformed has a 3-wide azure stripe (columns 8, 9, 10) starting from row 8.\n        *   Difference: Transformed incorrectly fills columns 8 and 10 from row 9 downwards.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Shape color: yellow (4)\n    *   Filler color: green (3)\n    *   Pattern center (r, c): (6, 12) (Input[6, 12] is white, Input[5, 12], Input[6, 11], Input[6, 13] are yellow)\n    *   Expected Output vs Transformed Output:\n        *   Expected has a green line down column 12, starting from row 7.\n        *   Expected has green pixels at (7, 11) and (7, 13).\n        *   Transformed has a 3-wide green stripe (columns 11, 12, 13) starting from row 7.\n        *   Difference: Transformed incorrectly fills columns 11 and 13 from row 8 downwards.\n\nThe core issue is confirmed: the \"stripe\" drawing logic is wrong. It should be a single vertical line below the center pixel, plus two additional pixels in the row immediately below the center pixel (one to the left, one to the right).\n\n**Refined Logic:**\n\n1.  Find the two non-white colors. Identify the `shape_color` forming the T-pattern and the `filler_color`.\n2.  Locate the central white pixel (r, c) where grid[r-1, c], grid[r, c-1], and grid[r, c+1] are all `shape_color`.\n3.  Create a copy of the input grid.\n4.  Fill the central pixel (r, c) with `filler_color`.\n5.  Fill the pixel directly below the center (r+1, c) with `filler_color`.\n6.  Fill the pixels diagonally below the center (r+1, c-1) and (r+1, c+1) with `filler_color`, checking for grid boundaries.\n7.  From row r+2 down to the bottom of the grid, fill the pixel in the central column (row, c) with `filler_color`.Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully identified the core pattern: a T-shape made of one non-white color (`shape_color`) surrounding a central white pixel, with a second non-white color (`filler_color`) scattered elsewhere. It also correctly located the coordinates (r, c) of this central white pixel.\n\nHowever, the transformation applied below this central pixel was incorrect. The code drew a 3-pixel-wide vertical stripe using the `filler_color` starting from row `r+1` downwards. The expected output shows a different pattern:\n1.  The central pixel (r, c) is filled with the `filler_color`.\n2.  In the row immediately below the center (`r+1`), the pixels at `(r+1, c-1)`, `(r+1, c)`, and `(r+1, c+1)` are filled with the `filler_color` (forming a small horizontal line).\n3.  From row `r+2` downwards to the bottom edge, *only* the pixels in the central column `c` (i.e., `(row, c)` for `row >= r+2`) are filled with the `filler_color`.\n\nThe strategy is to adjust the drawing logic to match this observed pattern: fill the center, fill the three pixels below it in row `r+1`, and then fill only the single central column from `r+2` downwards.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Pattern Center (r, c) | Shape Color | Filler Color | Output Shape | Pixels Changed (Expected) | Pixels Changed (Transformed) | Incorrectly Filled Pixels | Correctly Filled Pixels |\n| :------ | :---------- | :-------------------- | :---------- | :----------- | :----------- | :------------------------ | :--------------------------- | :------------------------ | :---------------------- |\n| 1       | (20, 20)    | (7, 7)                | Orange (7)  | Red (2)      | (20, 20)     | 1 + 3 + 12 = 16           | 1 + (3 * 12) = 37            | 24                        | 13                      |\n| 2       | (20, 20)    | (7, 9)                | Maroon (9)  | Azure (8)    | (20, 20)     | 1 + 3 + 12 = 16           | 1 + (3 * 12) = 37            | 24                        | 13                      |\n| 3       | (20, 20)    | (6, 12)               | Yellow (4)  | Green (3)    | (20, 20)     | 1 + 3 + 13 = 17           | 1 + (3 * 13) = 40            | 26                        | 14                      |\n\n*   **Pattern Center (r, c)**: Row and column index of the central white pixel identified by the `find_pattern_center_and_colors` function.\n*   **Pixels Changed (Expected)**: Count calculated as: 1 (center pixel) + 3 (pixels in row r+1) + (grid\\_height - (r+2)) (pixels in center column below row r+1).\n*   **Pixels Changed (Transformed)**: Count calculated by the previous code: 1 (center pixel) + 3 * (grid\\_height - (r+1)) (3-wide stripe below center).\n*   **Incorrectly Filled Pixels**: The number of pixels colored by the transform function that should not have been, based on comparison with the expected output. These are the extra pixels in the side columns of the 3-wide stripe from row `r+2` downwards. Calculated as `2 * (grid_height - (r+2))`. Example 1: `2 * (20 - (7+2)) = 2 * 11 = 22`. Ah, the previous report said 36, 24, 25 pixels off. Let's re-check.\n    *   Example 1: Center (7,7). Expected changes: (7,7), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), and (9..19, 7). Total = 1 + 3 + 11 = 15. Previous code changed: (7,7) and (8..19, 6..8). Total = 1 + 12*3 = 37. Difference = 37 - 15 = 22 pixels. Why did the report say 36? Maybe it compared the input to the transformed output? Let's check pixels changed between input and transformed output vs input and expected output.\n        *   Input vs Expected (Ex1): Red=2, Orange=7. Center (7,7). Output adds Red at (7,7), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), and (9..19, 7). 15 pixels.\n        *   Input vs Transformed (Ex1): Output adds Red at (7,7), (8..19, 6), (8..19, 7), (8..19, 8). 1 + 12 + 12 + 12 = 37 pixels.\n        *   Expected vs Transformed (Ex1): Expected has Red at (7,7), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (9..19, 7). Transformed has Red at (7,7), (8..19, 6..8). Pixels different: Transformed has (9..19, 6) and (9..19, 8) which Expected doesn't (11+11=22). Expected has (8,6) and (8,8) which Transformed also has. Okay, the difference is 22 pixels. The initial report's \"Pixels Off\" count seems unreliable or calculated differently. Let's stick to the logic. The core error is the width of the stripe below row r+1.\n*   **Correctly Filled Pixels**: Pixels correctly changed by the previous transform compared to the expected output. Calculated as 1 (center) + 1 (pixel at r+1, c) + (grid\\_height - (r+2)) (pixels below r+1 in center column). Example 1: 1 + 1 + 11 = 13.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
