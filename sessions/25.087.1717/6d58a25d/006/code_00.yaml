task_description: Find a specific T-pattern and draw a shape below it using a secondary color.

grid_properties:
  - size: Variable (e.g., 20x20 in examples).
  - background_color: white (0).
  - number_of_colors: Always 3 (white + two other distinct colors).

objects:
  - object: T_shape
    description: A T-shaped pattern made of a single color ('shape_color').
    properties:
      - color: One of the two non-white colors ('shape_color').
      - structure: Consists of three pixels of 'shape_color' surrounding a central white pixel. Specifically, if the white pixel is at (r, c), the 'shape_color' pixels are at (r-1, c), (r, c-1), and (r, c+1).
      - role: Acts as an anchor point for the transformation.
  - object: filler_pixels
    description: Scattered pixels of the other non-white color ('filler_color').
    properties:
      - color: The non-white color that is not the 'shape_color'.
      - distribution: Appears sparsely in the input grid.
      - role: Provides the color used for drawing the new shape in the output.
  - object: output_shape
    description: A new shape drawn in the output grid using the 'filler_color'.
    properties:
      - color: The 'filler_color'.
      - location: Anchored relative to the central white pixel (r, c) of the T_shape.
      - structure:
          - A single pixel at the anchor location (r, c).
          - A horizontal 3-pixel line in the row below the anchor: (r+1, c-1), (r+1, c), (r+1, c+1). (Boundary checks needed for c-1, c+1).
          - A vertical 1-pixel wide line starting from row r+2 down to the bottom edge, aligned with the anchor column c: (row, c) for row >= r+2.

actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    description: Find the two distinct non-white colors present in the input grid.
  - action: locate_anchor
    description: Find the coordinates (r, c) of the white pixel that serves as the center of the T_shape pattern. This implicitly identifies the 'shape_color'.
  - action: determine_filler_color
    description: Identify the 'filler_color' as the non-white color that is not the 'shape_color'.
  - action: copy_grid
    description: Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - action: draw_output_shape
    description: Modify the output grid by coloring specific pixels relative to the anchor point (r, c) with the 'filler_color'.
    steps:
      - Fill pixel (r, c).
      - Fill pixels (r+1, c-1), (r+1, c), (r+1, c+1) (respecting boundaries).
      - Fill pixels (row, c) for all rows from r+2 to the bottom edge.

state_changes:
  - The output grid initially matches the input grid.
  - Specific pixels in the output grid are changed from their original color (often white, but could be the shape_color or filler_color if the pattern overlaps) to the 'filler_color', forming the 'output_shape'.
