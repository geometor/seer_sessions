"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying a specific T-shaped pattern and drawing a 3-pixel-wide vertical stripe below it.

The transformation rule involves these steps:
1.  Identify two distinct non-white colors in the grid. One color ('shape_color') 
    forms a specific T-shaped pattern around a central white pixel, and the other 
    ('filler_color') is scattered elsewhere.
2.  Locate the central white pixel (center_row, center_col) which has the 
    'shape_color' directly above it, to its left, and to its right. 
    Specifically, find (r, c) such that grid[r, c] == 0 and 
    grid[r-1, c] == grid[r, c-1] == grid[r, c+1] == shape_color.
3.  Change the color of the central pixel (center_row, center_col) in the output 
    grid to the 'filler_color'.
4.  Starting one row below the central pixel (from row center_row + 1), draw a 
    vertical stripe downwards to the bottom edge of the grid. This stripe uses the 
    'filler_color'.
5.  The columns for this vertical stripe are the column immediately to the left of 
    the central pixel's column, the central pixel's column itself, and the column 
    immediately to the right (center_col - 1, center_col, and center_col + 1).
6.  All other pixels retain their original colors from the input grid.
