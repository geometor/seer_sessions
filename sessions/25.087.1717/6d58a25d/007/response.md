"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying a specific T-shaped pattern and drawing a shape below it using a secondary color.

The transformation rule involves these steps:
1.  Identify two distinct non-white colors in the grid. One color ('shape_color') 
    forms a specific T-shaped pattern around a central white pixel, and the other 
    ('filler_color') is scattered elsewhere.
2.  Locate the central white pixel (anchor_row, anchor_col) which has the 
    'shape_color' directly above it, to its left, and to its right. 
    Specifically, find (r, c) such that grid[r, c] == 0 and 
    grid[r-1, c] == grid[r, c-1] == grid[r, c+1] == shape_color.
3.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4.  Modify the output grid by drawing a shape using the 'filler_color' relative 
    to the anchor point (anchor_row, anchor_col):
    a.  Color the anchor pixel (anchor_row, anchor_col).
    b.  Color the three pixels in the row directly below the anchor: 
        (anchor_row + 1, anchor_col - 1), (anchor_row + 1, anchor_col), and 
        (anchor_row + 1, anchor_col + 1). Perform boundary checks to ensure 
        these columns are valid.
    c.  Color the pixels in the same column as the anchor, starting from two rows 
        below the anchor (anchor_row + 2) down to the bottom edge of the grid:
        (row, anchor_col) for row >= anchor_row + 2.
5.  All other pixels retain their original colors from the input grid.
