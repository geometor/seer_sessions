"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying a specific T-shaped pattern and drawing a 3-pixel-wide vertical stripe below it.

The transformation rule involves these steps:
1.  Identify two distinct non-white colors in the grid. One color ('shape_color') 
    forms a specific T-shaped pattern around a central white pixel, and the other 
    ('filler_color') is scattered elsewhere.
2.  Locate the central white pixel (center_row, center_col) which has the 
    'shape_color' directly above it, to its left, and to its right. 
    Specifically, find (r, c) such that grid[r, c] == 0 and 
    grid[r-1, c] == grid[r, c-1] == grid[r, c+1] == shape_color.
3.  Change the color of the central pixel (center_row, center_col) in the output 
    grid to the 'filler_color'.
4.  Starting one row below the central pixel (from row center_row + 1), draw a 
    vertical stripe downwards to the bottom edge of the grid. This stripe uses the 
    'filler_color'.
5.  The columns for this vertical stripe are the column immediately to the left of 
    the central pixel's column, the central pixel's column itself, and the column 
    immediately to the right (center_col - 1, center_col, and center_col + 1).
6.  All other pixels retain their original colors from the input grid.

Ah, my manual identification was slightly off. Let's re-evaluate based on the code's findings.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Shape color: orange (7)
    *   Filler color: red (2)
    *   Pattern center (r, c): (7, 7) (Input[7, 7] is white, Input[6, 7], Input[7, 6], Input[7, 8] are orange)
    *   Expected Output vs Transformed Output:
        *   Expected has a red line down column 7, starting from row 8.
        *   Expected has red pixels at (8, 6) and (8, 8).
        *   Transformed has a 3-wide red stripe (columns 6, 7, 8) starting from row 8.
        *   Difference: Transformed incorrectly fills columns 6 and 8 from row 9 downwards.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Shape color: maroon (9)
    *   Filler color: azure (8)
    *   Pattern center (r, c): (7, 9) (Input[7, 9] is white, Input[6, 9], Input[7, 8], Input[7, 10] are maroon)
    *   Expected Output vs Transformed Output:
        *   Expected has an azure line down column 9, starting from row 8.
        *   Expected has azure pixels at (8, 8) and (8, 10).
        *   Transformed has a 3-wide azure stripe (columns 8, 9, 10) starting from row 8.
        *   Difference: Transformed incorrectly fills columns 8 and 10 from row 9 downwards.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Shape color: yellow (4)
    *   Filler color: green (3)
    *   Pattern center (r, c): (6, 12) (Input[6, 12] is white, Input[5, 12], Input[6, 11], Input[6, 13] are yellow)
    *   Expected Output vs Transformed Output:
        *   Expected has a green line down column 12, starting from row 7.
        *   Expected has green pixels at (7, 11) and (7, 13).
        *   Transformed has a 3-wide green stripe (columns 11, 12, 13) starting from row 7.
        *   Difference: Transformed incorrectly fills columns 11 and 13 from row 8 downwards.

The core issue is confirmed: the "stripe" drawing logic is wrong. It should be a single vertical line below the center pixel, plus two additional pixels in the row immediately below the center pixel (one to the left, one to the right).

**Refined Logic:**

1.  Find the two non-white colors. Identify the `shape_color` forming the T-pattern and the `filler_color`.
2.  Locate the central white pixel (r, c) where grid[r-1, c], grid[r, c-1], and grid[r, c+1] are all `shape_color`.
3.  Create a copy of the input grid.
4.  Fill the central pixel (r, c) with `filler_color`.
5.  Fill the pixel directly below the center (r+1, c) with `filler_color`.
6.  Fill the pixels diagonally below the center (r+1, c-1) and (r+1, c+1) with `filler_color`, checking for grid boundaries.
7.  From row r+2 down to the bottom of the grid, fill the pixel in the central column (row, c) with `filler_color`.Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.

## General Assessment

The previous code successfully identified the core pattern: a T-shape made of one non-white color (`shape_color`) surrounding a central white pixel, with a second non-white color (`filler_color`) scattered elsewhere. It also correctly located the coordinates (r, c) of this central white pixel.

However, the transformation applied below this central pixel was incorrect. The code drew a 3-pixel-wide vertical stripe using the `filler_color` starting from row `r+1` downwards. The expected output shows a different pattern:
1.  The central pixel (r, c) is filled with the `filler_color`.
2.  In the row immediately below the center (`r+1`), the pixels at `(r+1, c-1)`, `(r+1, c)`, and `(r+1, c+1)` are filled with the `filler_color` (forming a small horizontal line).
3.  From row `r+2` downwards to the bottom edge, *only* the pixels in the central column `c` (i.e., `(row, c)` for `row >= r+2`) are filled with the `filler_color`.

The strategy is to adjust the drawing logic to match this observed pattern: fill the center, fill the three pixels below it in row `r+1`, and then fill only the single central column from `r+2` downwards.

## Metrics

| Example | Input Shape | Pattern Center (r, c) | Shape Color | Filler Color | Output Shape | Pixels Changed (Expected) | Pixels Changed (Transformed) | Incorrectly Filled Pixels | Correctly Filled Pixels |
| :------ | :---------- | :-------------------- | :---------- | :----------- | :----------- | :------------------------ | :--------------------------- | :------------------------ | :---------------------- |
| 1       | (20, 20)    | (7, 7)                | Orange (7)  | Red (2)      | (20, 20)     | 1 + 3 + 12 = 16           | 1 + (3 * 12) = 37            | 24                        | 13                      |
| 2       | (20, 20)    | (7, 9)                | Maroon (9)  | Azure (8)    | (20, 20)     | 1 + 3 + 12 = 16           | 1 + (3 * 12) = 37            | 24                        | 13                      |
| 3       | (20, 20)    | (6, 12)               | Yellow (4)  | Green (3)    | (20, 20)     | 1 + 3 + 13 = 17           | 1 + (3 * 13) = 40            | 26                        | 14                      |

*   **Pattern Center (r, c)**: Row and column index of the central white pixel identified by the `find_pattern_center_and_colors` function.
*   **Pixels Changed (Expected)**: Count calculated as: 1 (center pixel) + 3 (pixels in row r+1) + (grid\_height - (r+2)) (pixels in center column below row r+1).
*   **Pixels Changed (Transformed)**: Count calculated by the previous code: 1 (center pixel) + 3 * (grid\_height - (r+1)) (3-wide stripe below center).
*   **Incorrectly Filled Pixels**: The number of pixels colored by the transform function that should not have been, based on comparison with the expected output. These are the extra pixels in the side columns of the 3-wide stripe from row `r+2` downwards. Calculated as `2 * (grid_height - (r+2))`. Example 1: `2 * (20 - (7+2)) = 2 * 11 = 22`. Ah, the previous report said 36, 24, 25 pixels off. Let's re-check.
    *   Example 1: Center (7,7). Expected changes: (7,7), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), and (9..19, 7). Total = 1 + 3 + 11 = 15. Previous code changed: (7,7) and (8..19, 6..8). Total = 1 + 12*3 = 37. Difference = 37 - 15 = 22 pixels. Why did the report say 36? Maybe it compared the input to the transformed output? Let's check pixels changed between input and transformed output vs input and expected output.
        *   Input vs Expected (Ex1): Red=2, Orange=7. Center (7,7). Output adds Red at (7,7), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), and (9..19, 7). 15 pixels.
        *   Input vs Transformed (Ex1): Output adds Red at (7,7), (8..19, 6), (8..19, 7), (8..19, 8). 1 + 12 + 12 + 12 = 37 pixels.
        *   Expected vs Transformed (Ex1): Expected has Red at (7,7), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (9..19, 7). Transformed has Red at (7,7), (8..19, 6..8). Pixels different: Transformed has (9..19, 6) and (9..19, 8) which Expected doesn't (11+11=22). Expected has (8,6) and (8,8) which Transformed also has. Okay, the difference is 22 pixels. The initial report's "Pixels Off" count seems unreliable or calculated differently. Let's stick to the logic. The core error is the width of the stripe below row r+1.
*   **Correctly Filled Pixels**: Pixels correctly changed by the previous transform compared to the expected output. Calculated as 1 (center) + 1 (pixel at r+1, c) + (grid\_height - (r+2)) (pixels below r+1 in center column). Example 1: 1 + 1 + 11 = 13.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the two distinct non-white colors present in the input grid.
3.  Search the grid for a specific "T-pattern anchor": a white pixel (color 0) located at `(r, c)` such that the pixel directly above it `(r-1, c)`, the pixel to its left `(r, c-1)`, and the pixel to its right `(r, c+1)` are all the *same* non-white color. This non-white color is the `shape_color`.
4.  Determine the `filler_color` which is the other non-white color present in the grid (i.e., not white and not the `shape_color`).
5.  Modify the output grid based on the anchor location `(r, c)` and the `filler_color`:
    a.  Change the color of the pixel at the anchor location `(r, c)` to the `filler_color`.
    b.  Change the color of the pixel directly below the anchor `(r+1, c)` to the `filler_color`.
    c.  If the column `c-1` is within the grid bounds, change the color of the pixel at `(r+1, c-1)` to the `filler_color`.
    d.  If the column `c+1` is within the grid bounds, change the color of the pixel at `(r+1, c+1)` to the `filler_color`.
    e.  For every row `row_idx` starting from `r+2` down to the last row of the grid, change the color of the pixel at `(row_idx, c)` to the `filler_color`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
