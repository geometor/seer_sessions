task_description: Identifies a specific T-shaped pattern and draws a vertical stripe below it.

grid_properties:
  - size: Variable (e.g., 20x20)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - num_colors: Exactly 3 colors present in input (white + 2 others).

objects:
  - object_type: pattern_anchor
    description: >
      A T-shaped structure pointing downwards, formed by a single color
      ('shape_color') surrounding a central white pixel.
    properties:
      - shape: T-shape (3 pixels of shape_color)
      - center: A white pixel (r, c)
      - components:
          - pixel at (r-1, c) is shape_color
          - pixel at (r, c-1) is shape_color
          - pixel at (r, c+1) is shape_color
  - object_type: filler_pixels
    description: >
      Scattered pixels of a second non-white color ('filler_color'). Their
      initial positions are irrelevant to the core transformation, except for
      identifying the filler_color itself.
  - object_type: generated_stripe
    description: A vertical stripe added to the output grid.
    properties:
      - color: filler_color
      - width: 3 pixels
      - location: Centered horizontally on the pattern_anchor's center column.
      - vertical_extent: Starts 1 row below the pattern_anchor's center row and extends to the bottom edge.

actions:
  - action: identify_pattern_and_colors
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs:
      - shape_color: The color forming the T-shape.
      - filler_color: The other non-white color present.
      - center_row: Row index of the central white pixel of the pattern.
      - center_col: Column index of the central white pixel of the pattern.
  - action: modify_grid
    inputs: input_grid, shape_color, filler_color, center_row, center_col
    outputs: output_grid
    steps:
      - 1: Create a copy of the input_grid.
      - 2: Change the color of the pixel at (center_row, center_col) to filler_color.
      - 3: Determine the stripe columns: [center_col - 1, center_col, center_col + 1].
      - 4: Determine the stripe start row: center_row + 1.
      - 5: For each row from start_row to the bottom edge of the grid:
           Set the pixels in the stripe columns to filler_color.
      - 6: Return the modified grid.

constraints:
  - Exactly two non-white colors must be present.
  - The T-shaped pattern must exist and be unique.
  - The pattern center is not on the grid edges (top, left, or right), allowing neighbors to be checked.
