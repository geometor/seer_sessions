            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the transformation.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core pattern (a white pixel with three neighbors of one color) and the two key colors involved ('shape\\_color' and 'filler\\_color') in all examples. However, the action performed based on this pattern was inaccurate. The code drew two vertical lines starting two rows below the pattern center, whereas the expected output shows a three-pixel-wide vertical stripe starting one row below the pattern center.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the pattern identification logic remains valid.\n2.  Precisely describe the shape (a 3-wide vertical stripe) that needs to be drawn.\n3.  Specify the exact starting row and columns for this stripe relative to the identified pattern center.\n4.  Update the natural language program to reflect this revised transformation rule.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nBased on visual comparison between the `Expected Output` and `Transformed Output` for each example:\n\n*   **Pattern Identification:** The code correctly located the central white pixel `(r, c)` and identified the `shape_color` (the color at `(r-1, c)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c+1)`) and the `filler_color` (the other non-white color) in all three examples.\n    *   Example 1: Center (7, 7), Shape=Orange(7), Filler=Red(2)\n    *   Example 2: Center (7, 9), Shape=Maroon(9), Filler=Azure(8)\n    *   Example 3: Center (6, 12), Shape=Yellow(4), Filler=Green(3)\n*   **Transformation Step 1 (Center Fill):** The code correctly changed the color of the central white pixel `(r, c)` to the `filler_color` in all examples. This matches the expected outputs.\n*   **Transformation Step 2 (Drawing):** This is where the discrepancy lies.\n    *   **Expected:** A vertical stripe using the `filler_color` is drawn starting from row `r+1` down to the bottom edge. This stripe occupies columns `c-1`, `c`, and `c+1`.\n    *   **Actual (Code):** Two vertical lines using the `filler_color` were drawn starting from row `r+2` down to the bottom edge. These lines occupied columns `c-1` and `c+1` only.\n    *   **Error Cause:** The code incorrectly calculated the starting row (`r+2` instead of `r+1`) and omitted the central column (`c`) from the drawing process. The number of differing pixels (`Pixels Off`) reflects the missing central column line and the incorrect starting row for the two side lines across all affected rows.\n\nNo specific code execution is required for further metrics at this point, as the error pattern is consistent and clear.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
