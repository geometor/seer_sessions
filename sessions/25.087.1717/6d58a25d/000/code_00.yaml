task_context:
  grid_size: [20, 20]
  colors_present:
    - background: 0 (white)
    - shape_color: [7 (orange), 9 (maroon), 4 (yellow)] # Varies per example
    - filler_color: [2 (red), 8 (azure), 3 (green)] # Varies per example, distinct from shape_color

identified_objects:
  - object: plus_shape
    description: A 5-pixel shape consisting of a central pixel and one pixel directly above, below, left, and right. Made of a single 'shape_color'. Always has a white center pixel in the input.
    properties:
      color: shape_color
      center_pixel: (row, col)
      extent: 3x3 bounding box
  - object: scattered_pixels
    description: Multiple single pixels of the 'filler_color' distributed across the grid.
    properties:
      color: filler_color
      count: variable
      connectivity: non-contiguous (isolated)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The 'plus_shape' is located somewhere within the grid. The 'scattered_pixels' are distributed elsewhere.
  - type: color_role
    description: One non-background color forms the 'plus_shape', the other non-background color acts as the 'filler_color' for the transformation.

actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    description: Determine the background, shape_color, and filler_color.
  - action: locate_shape
    description: Find the coordinates (row, col) of the center pixel of the 'plus_shape'.
  - action: fill_center
    description: Change the color of the center pixel of the 'plus_shape' to the 'filler_color'.
  - action: draw_lines
    description: Starting two rows below the 'plus_shape' center, draw two vertical lines using the 'filler_color'.
    details:
      - Lines are in columns `col - 1` and `col + 1` relative to the center pixel.
      - Lines extend from row `row + 2` to the bottom edge of the grid.

output_conditions:
  - Preserve original pixels (except the filled center).
  - Add the filled center pixel.
  - Add the two vertical lines below the shape.
