This shape is 5 pixels in total: a center pixel and one pixel extending in each cardinal direction (up, down, left, right).\n4.  **Scattered Pixels:** The second non-background color appears as individual pixels scattered across the grid. Their positions seem arbitrary relative to the 'plus' shape but are preserved in the output.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens relative to the 'plus' shape.\n    *   The central white pixel *inside* the 'plus' shape is filled with the color of the scattered pixels.\n    *   Two vertical lines are drawn downwards starting from the row below the 'plus' shape's horizontal bar. These lines use the color of the scattered pixels and align vertically with the left and right ends of the 'plus' shape's horizontal bar (i.e., they are in columns `center_col - 1` and `center_col + 1`). These lines extend to the bottom edge of the grid.\n6.  **Consistency:** All original pixels (background, scattered color, and the 'plus' shape itself) remain unchanged in the output, except for the newly added colored pixels.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
