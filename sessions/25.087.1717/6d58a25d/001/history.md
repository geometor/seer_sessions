**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task operates on 20x20 grids.
2.  **Colors:** Each example uses three colors: white (0) as the background, one color forming a 'plus' shape (orange=7, maroon=9, yellow=4), and another color appearing as scattered single pixels (red=2, azure=8, green=3).
3.  **Key Shape:** The consistent feature across inputs is a 'plus' shape (+) made of a single color. This shape is 5 pixels in total: a center pixel and one pixel extending in each cardinal direction (up, down, left, right).
4.  **Scattered Pixels:** The second non-background color appears as individual pixels scattered across the grid. Their positions seem arbitrary relative to the 'plus' shape but are preserved in the output.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens relative to the 'plus' shape.
    *   The central white pixel *inside* the 'plus' shape is filled with the color of the scattered pixels.
    *   Two vertical lines are drawn downwards starting from the row below the 'plus' shape's horizontal bar. These lines use the color of the scattered pixels and align vertically with the left and right ends of the 'plus' shape's horizontal bar (i.e., they are in columns `center_col - 1` and `center_col + 1`). These lines extend to the bottom edge of the grid.
6.  **Consistency:** All original pixels (background, scattered color, and the 'plus' shape itself) remain unchanged in the output, except for the newly added colored pixels.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_size: [20, 20]
  colors_present:
    - background: 0 (white)
    - shape_color: [7 (orange), 9 (maroon), 4 (yellow)] # Varies per example
    - filler_color: [2 (red), 8 (azure), 3 (green)] # Varies per example, distinct from shape_color

identified_objects:
  - object: plus_shape
    description: A 5-pixel shape consisting of a central pixel and one pixel directly above, below, left, and right. Made of a single 'shape_color'. Always has a white center pixel in the input.
    properties:
      color: shape_color
      center_pixel: (row, col)
      extent: 3x3 bounding box
  - object: scattered_pixels
    description: Multiple single pixels of the 'filler_color' distributed across the grid.
    properties:
      color: filler_color
      count: variable
      connectivity: non-contiguous (isolated)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The 'plus_shape' is located somewhere within the grid. The 'scattered_pixels' are distributed elsewhere.
  - type: color_role
    description: One non-background color forms the 'plus_shape', the other non-background color acts as the 'filler_color' for the transformation.

actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    description: Determine the background, shape_color, and filler_color.
  - action: locate_shape
    description: Find the coordinates (row, col) of the center pixel of the 'plus_shape'.
  - action: fill_center
    description: Change the color of the center pixel of the 'plus_shape' to the 'filler_color'.
  - action: draw_lines
    description: Starting two rows below the 'plus_shape' center, draw two vertical lines using the 'filler_color'.
    details:
      - Lines are in columns `col - 1` and `col + 1` relative to the center pixel.
      - Lines extend from row `row + 2` to the bottom edge of the grid.

output_conditions:
  - Preserve original pixels (except the filled center).
  - Add the filled center pixel.
  - Add the two vertical lines below the shape.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the two non-white colors in the input grid. One color forms a connected 5-pixel 'plus' shape (the `shape_color`), and the other color consists of scattered single pixels (the `filler_color`).
2.  Locate the central pixel coordinates `(center_row, center_col)` of the `shape_color` 'plus' shape. Note that this central pixel is initially white (0).
3.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
4.  Modify the output grid:
    a.  Set the pixel at `(center_row, center_col)` to the `filler_color`.
    b.  Iterate through all rows from `row = center_row + 2` down to the last row index of the grid. In each `row`:
        i.  Set the pixel at `(row, center_col - 1)` to the `filler_color`.
        ii. Set the pixel at `(row, center_col + 1)` to the `filler_color`.
5.  Return the modified grid.
