These act as the source colors for the transformation.\n    *   Outside the palette area, there are several distinct shapes (objects) all made of a single color (blue/1 in the first example, azure/8 in the second). These are the \"target objects\" that will be recolored.\n    *   The palette area and its internal non-gray colors remain unchanged in the output.\n    *   The target objects in the input are recolored in the output using the colors found inside the palette area.\n    *   The key challenge is determining the mapping: which target object gets which color from the palette.\n    *   Observing the examples, the mapping seems to depend on the spatial ordering. The target objects, when ordered top-to-bottom, left-to-right based on their top-left corner, correspond to the palette colors ordered similarly (top-to-bottom, left-to-right based on their first appearance within the palette area).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
