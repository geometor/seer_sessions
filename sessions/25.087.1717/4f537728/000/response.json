Within this pattern, there is a single, small, contiguous object of a different color (green (3) in the first example, red (2) in the second). These grids have horizontal rows of all white pixels separating blocks of the blue/white pattern.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the same dimensions and the same basic background structure (blue/white pattern and separating white rows) as the input. The key difference is the modification based on the unique colored object.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the unique colored object (the \"source\" object). The color of this source object is then propagated horizontally along the rows it occupies and vertically along the columns it occupies. This propagation specifically replaces only the blue (1) pixels found in those rows and columns with the source object's color. The original source object remains, and white (0) pixels are unaffected by the propagation.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The crucial first step is isolating the source object, which is defined by being contiguous and having a color different from both white (0) and the main pattern color (blue, 1).\n5.  **Propagation Mechanism:** The color spreads like a 'dye' along the row and column lines originating from the source object's bounding box, but it only affects pixels of the specific background pattern color (blue).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
