grid_properties:
  size_preservation: true
  background_color: 0  # white
  pattern_base_color: 1  # blue

objects:
  - type: source_object
    description: A single contiguous block of pixels with a color other than white (0) or blue (1).
    properties:
      - color: The specific color of the object (e.g., 3 for green, 2 for red). Let's call this 'source_color'.
      - location: Defined by the set of rows and columns it occupies.
      - count: Exactly one per input grid.
  - type: pattern_pixels
    description: Pixels belonging to the primary repeating pattern.
    properties:
      - color: 1 (blue)
  - type: background_pixels
    description: Pixels not part of the source object or the pattern.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)

actions:
  - name: identify_source_object
    input: input_grid
    output: source_object (including its color, rows, and columns)
  - name: propagate_color
    input: input_grid, source_object
    output: output_grid
    description: >
      Replaces pattern_pixels (blue, 1) with the source_object's color
      if they fall within the rows or columns occupied by the source_object.

relationships:
  - type: modification_target
    subject: pattern_pixels (blue, 1)
    object: source_object
    condition: >
      A blue pixel is modified if its row index is among the source object's row indices
      OR if its column index is among the source object's column indices.
  - type: invariance
    subject: background_pixels (white, 0)
    condition: White pixels are never changed.
  - type: invariance
    subject: source_object
    condition: The original source object pixels remain unchanged in the output.

constraints:
  - Color propagation only affects blue (1) pixels.
  - Propagation occurs strictly along the rows and columns defined by the source object's initial position.
