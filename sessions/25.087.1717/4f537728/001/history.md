**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist primarily of a repeating background pattern composed of blue (1) and white (0) pixels. Within this pattern, there is a single, small, contiguous object of a different color (green (3) in the first example, red (2) in the second). These grids have horizontal rows of all white pixels separating blocks of the blue/white pattern.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the same dimensions and the same basic background structure (blue/white pattern and separating white rows) as the input. The key difference is the modification based on the unique colored object.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the unique colored object (the "source" object). The color of this source object is then propagated horizontally along the rows it occupies and vertically along the columns it occupies. This propagation specifically replaces only the blue (1) pixels found in those rows and columns with the source object's color. The original source object remains, and white (0) pixels are unaffected by the propagation.
4.  **Object Identification:** The crucial first step is isolating the source object, which is defined by being contiguous and having a color different from both white (0) and the main pattern color (blue, 1).
5.  **Propagation Mechanism:** The color spreads like a 'dye' along the row and column lines originating from the source object's bounding box, but it only affects pixels of the specific background pattern color (blue).

**Facts**


```yaml
grid_properties:
  size_preservation: true
  background_color: 0  # white
  pattern_base_color: 1  # blue

objects:
  - type: source_object
    description: A single contiguous block of pixels with a color other than white (0) or blue (1).
    properties:
      - color: The specific color of the object (e.g., 3 for green, 2 for red). Let's call this 'source_color'.
      - location: Defined by the set of rows and columns it occupies.
      - count: Exactly one per input grid.
  - type: pattern_pixels
    description: Pixels belonging to the primary repeating pattern.
    properties:
      - color: 1 (blue)
  - type: background_pixels
    description: Pixels not part of the source object or the pattern.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)

actions:
  - name: identify_source_object
    input: input_grid
    output: source_object (including its color, rows, and columns)
  - name: propagate_color
    input: input_grid, source_object
    output: output_grid
    description: >
      Replaces pattern_pixels (blue, 1) with the source_object's color
      if they fall within the rows or columns occupied by the source_object.

relationships:
  - type: modification_target
    subject: pattern_pixels (blue, 1)
    object: source_object
    condition: >
      A blue pixel is modified if its row index is among the source object's row indices
      OR if its column index is among the source object's column indices.
  - type: invariance
    subject: background_pixels (white, 0)
    condition: White pixels are never changed.
  - type: invariance
    subject: source_object
    condition: The original source object pixels remain unchanged in the output.

constraints:
  - Color propagation only affects blue (1) pixels.
  - Propagation occurs strictly along the rows and columns defined by the source object's initial position.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the "source object" in the input grid: Find the contiguous group of pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor blue (1).
3.  Determine the color of the source object (let's call this `source_color`).
4.  Determine the set of unique row indices occupied by the source object (let's call this `source_rows`).
5.  Determine the set of unique column indices occupied by the source object (let's call this `source_cols`).
6.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at position (row, col) with color `pixel_color`:
    *   If `pixel_color` is blue (1) AND (`row` is in `source_rows` OR `col` is in `source_cols`):
        *   Change the color of the pixel at (row, col) in the output grid to `source_color`.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
