```python
"""
Identifies a single "source object" (pixels with color > 1) in the input grid.
Determines the color and the row/column indices occupied by this source object.
Creates an output grid by copying the input grid.
Iterates through the grid: if a pixel has the background pattern color (blue, 1) 
and its row or column index matches one of the source object's indices, 
changes that pixel's color in the output grid to the source object's color.
White (0) pixels and the original source object pixels remain unchanged.
