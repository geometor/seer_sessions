"""
Identifies contiguous shapes made of a primary non-white color that contain exactly one 'marker' pixel of a different non-white color.
For each such shape:
1. The border pixels of the primary color remain unchanged.
2. A diamond pattern, using the marker's color, expands outwards from the marker's location.
3. This pattern only colors pixels that were originally part of the shape's primary color area and are not on the border.
4. The expansion stops when the diamond layer no longer overlaps with the shape's non-border primary color area.
5. All original primary-colored pixels that are not on the border and not colored by the diamond pattern are set to white (0).
6. The original marker pixel location is also set to white (0).
Shapes without exactly one marker pixel remain unchanged.

## General Assessment

The provided code successfully identifies the target shapes (contiguous non-white areas with exactly one different non-white marker pixel) and correctly identifies their primary color, marker color, marker location, and border pixels. However, the implementation of the diamond pattern generation is incorrect. Instead of creating a *hollow* diamond shape expanding outwards from the marker, the current code generates a *filled* diamond or colors almost the entire interior region with the marker color. Consequently, the clearing of the remaining interior pixels to white is also incorrect, as too many pixels are colored by the flawed pattern logic.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to revise the diamond pattern generation algorithm. The core change needed is to ensure that only pixels *exactly* at the current Manhattan distance from the marker are colored in each step of the expansion, creating a hollow structure. The expansion should stop when a layer of the diamond pattern no longer overlaps with any interior pixels of the original shape. Finally, all interior pixels *not* part of the final hollow diamond outline must be set to white.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze Example 1 to illustrate the discrepancy:
*   **Input:** A large green (3) rectangle with a single magenta (6) marker at (2, 9).
*   **Shape Identification:** Correctly identified (Primary: 3, Marker: 6 at (2,9)).
*   **Border:** The outer layer of green pixels is correctly identified as the border.
*   **Expected Output:**
    *   Green border pixels remain green.
    *   Magenta pixels form a hollow diamond pattern expanding from the original marker location (which becomes white). Manhattan distance 1 has 4 pixels, distance 2 has 8, etc.
    *   All green pixels inside the border that are *not* part of the magenta diamond pattern are cleared to white (0).
    *   The original marker pixel at (2, 9) is cleared to white (0).
*   **Transformed Output:**
    *   Green border pixels remain green.
    *   Magenta pixels fill a large diamond-like area, incorrectly coloring pixels that should have remained white.
    *   The original marker pixel at (2, 9) appears to be cleared (or overwritten by the pattern fill starting at d=1). The code explicitly clears it later, which is correct.

This pattern of generating a filled shape instead of a hollow one is repeated across all examples and all shapes within them.

```
The code execution confirms the visual assessment. The number of differing pixels is significant in each case. The sample incorrect pixels show that the transformed output tends to have the marker color where the expected output has white (0), indicating the interior is being filled incorrectly. The color counts further confirm this: the transformed outputs consistently have a higher count of the marker color and a lower count of white (0) compared to the expected outputs. Notably, in Example 2, the original marker pixel (Input: 1) at (2, 2) is expected to be white (0) but is transformed to blue (1) in the output shown (transformed_2[2,2] is 0 in the printout but blue=1 in the visual grid shown before the code block - there might be an off-by-one or interpretation error in the manual analysis or the provided transformed grid visual). However, the code *does* explicitly set the marker position to 0. The main issue remains the filled vs. hollow pattern. *Correction:* Looking closely at the provided `transformed_2` grid visual, `transformed_2[2,2]` is indeed 0. The pixel at `(2, 3)` is expected 0, transformed 1. The analysis code correctly shows this. The discrepancy was in my quick manual check.

          - The pattern uses the marker_pixel's color.
          - It expands outwards layer by layer based on Manhattan distance (d=1, 2, 3...).
          - A layer consists of all pixels exactly at the current Manhattan distance `d` from the marker_pixel's coordinate.
          - Only pixels belonging to the shape's original interior_pixels set can be colored by the diamond pattern.
          - The expansion stops when a layer contains no pixels that overlap with the shape's original interior_pixels.

  - For each shape identified and filtered:
      1. Copy the input grid to the output grid.
      2. Identify the shape's components (border, interior, marker).
      3. Generate the hollow diamond pattern using the marker color, coloring only original interior pixels.
      4. Update the output grid with the diamond pattern pixels.
      5. Update the output grid by setting non-diamond interior pixels to white (0).
      6. Update the output grid by setting the original marker pixel location to white (0).
      7. Border pixels are implicitly preserved as they were copied and not modified.
  - Pixels not part of any identified and filtered shape remain unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Shapes:** Scan the input grid to find all distinct connected components of non-white pixels using 4-directional adjacency.
2.  **Analyze Components:** For each component found:
    a.  Determine the primary color (the most frequent non-white color within the component).
    b.  Identify all pixels that are *not* the primary color. These are potential markers.
    c.  Count the number of potential marker pixels.
3.  **Filter Shapes:** Select only those components that contain *exactly one* marker pixel. Let the primary color be `P`, the marker color be `M`, and the marker coordinate be `(mr, mc)`. Components with zero or more than one marker are left unchanged in the output grid.
4.  **Process Selected Shapes:** For each selected shape:
    a.  **Initialize Output:** Copy the input grid to create the initial output grid.
    b.  **Identify Border:** Determine the set of border pixels (`border_pixels`) belonging to the primary color `P`. A pixel `(r, c)` with color `P` is a border pixel if any of its 4-directional neighbors are outside the grid or outside the current connected component.
    c.  **Identify Interior:** Determine the set of interior pixels (`interior_primary_pixels`) belonging to the primary color `P`. These are all pixels with color `P` that are *not* `border_pixels`.
    d.  **Generate Hollow Diamond:**
        i.  Initialize an empty set `pixels_for_diamond_pattern`.
        ii. Start with Manhattan distance `d = 1`.
        iii. Loop indefinitely:
            1.  Find all coordinates `(r, c)` such that `abs(r - mr) + abs(c - mc) == d`.
            2.  Create a subset `target_pixels_this_layer` containing only those coordinates from the previous step that are also present in the `interior_primary_pixels` set.
            3.  If `target_pixels_this_layer` is empty, break the loop (the diamond expansion stops).
            4.  Add all coordinates from `target_pixels_this_layer` to the `pixels_for_diamond_pattern` set.
            5.  Increment `d`.
    e.  **Update Output Grid:**
        i.  For each coordinate `(r, c)` in `pixels_for_diamond_pattern`, set the pixel value in the output grid to the marker color `M`.
        ii. For each coordinate `(r, c)` in `interior_primary_pixels` that is *not* in `pixels_for_diamond_pattern`, set the pixel value in the output grid to white (0).
        iii. Set the pixel value at the original marker coordinate `(mr, mc)` in the output grid to white (0).
        iv. (Border pixels retain their primary color `P` as they were copied initially and not modified by steps i, ii, or iii).
5.  **Final Output:** The resulting grid after processing all selected shapes is the final output.
