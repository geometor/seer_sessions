"""
Identifies contiguous shapes made of a primary non-white color (most frequent) 
that contain exactly one 'marker' pixel of a different non-white color.
For each such shape:
1. The border pixels of the primary color remain unchanged.
2. A hollow diamond pattern, using the marker's color, expands outwards from 
   the marker's location based on Manhattan distance.
3. This pattern only colors pixels that were originally part of the shape's 
   primary color area and are not on the border (interior primary pixels).
4. The expansion stops when the next diamond layer (at distance d) no longer 
   overlaps with any interior primary pixels.
5. All original interior primary pixels that are not colored by the final 
   hollow diamond pattern are set to white (0).
6. The original marker pixel location is also set to white (0).
Shapes without exactly one marker pixel, or components made entirely of one 
non-white color, remain unchanged.
Pixels outside of any processed shape remain unchanged.

Okay, the metrics confirm the visual assessment.
*   Input: 89 green (3) pixels, 1 magenta (6) marker.
*   Expected: 34 green (border pixels), 14 magenta (pattern pixels), 134 white (background + cleared interior + cleared marker). The expected pattern pixels are at Manhattan distances 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13 from the marker (2, 9). Wait, why distance 0? The marker itself (2,9) is color 6 in the *expected output*? Let me re-check the image provided in the prompt.
*   Ah, I see the error in my reading of the expected output. Pixel (2, 9) is *magenta (6)* in the input and *white (0)* in the expected output. The code output shows it as white (0). The python code check identified (2,9) as having color 6 in the expected output array because *I copied it wrong* into the python code block above. Let me fix that.

Corrected Expected Output 1:

This is much clearer.

*   **Expected Transformation:** Identifies the green shape and magenta marker. Keeps the green border (34 pixels). Identifies the 55 interior green pixels. Finds all points within the interior green pixels that lie on the diamond shells expanding from the marker (Manhattan distance). Colors *only these diamond shell points* (12 pixels) with the marker color (magenta). Clears the original marker position (1 pixel) and all *other* interior green pixels that were *not* part of the diamond shells (55 - 12 = 43 pixels) to white. Total cleared = 1 (marker) + 43 (interior) = 44 pixels.
*   **Failed Transformation:** Identified shape, marker, border, and interior correctly. It correctly cleared the marker pixel (1 pixel). However, it incorrectly colored *all* 55 interior green pixels with the marker color (magenta) instead of just the 12 pixels on the diamond shells.

The error in the previous code is in step `3c. Generate Hollow Diamond Pattern` and `4. Update the Output Grid`. It collected *all* points within the expanding diamond boundary that were interior points, rather than just the points *exactly* on the boundary (shell) at each distance `d`. It then colored all these collected points magenta and only cleared the marker.

**General Assessment and Strategy Recap:**

*   The overall logic of finding shapes (contiguous non-white areas), identifying a primary color (most frequent), finding exactly one marker pixel of a different color, and separating border/interior primary pixels is correct.
*   The core error is in generating the pattern: it should be a *hollow diamond* (only pixels at exact Manhattan distance `d`) expanding outwards, coloring only interior primary pixels it intersects.
*   The clearing step was also incorrect: it should clear the original marker position *and* any interior primary pixels *not* colored by the hollow diamond pattern.
*   The strategy is to fix the pattern generation loop to only identify and color pixels exactly at distance `d` that are also interior primary pixels, and adjust the clearing logic accordingly.

---

## General Assessment of Information and Strategy

The provided examples and the failed code execution results clearly show the transformation rule involves identifying specific shapes and modifying their interiors based on a marker pixel. The core concept of finding connected components with a primary color and a single, unique marker color seems sound and is consistent across examples. The border pixels of the primary color are consistently preserved.

The failure arises in the implementation of the interior modification. The previous code generated a filled area based on Manhattan distance from the marker, while the expected outputs show a hollow, expanding diamond pattern (or similar geometric pattern based on Manhattan distance) using the marker's color. The pixels within the shape's interior that are not part of this pattern, along with the original marker pixel, are cleared to white.

**Strategy:**
1.  Refine the `find_shapes_and_markers` and `find_border_pixels` functions if necessary (though they seem mostly correct). Ensure 4-connectivity is appropriate (visual inspection suggests it is).
2.  Rewrite the pattern generation logic (`transform` function) to correctly compute the hollow diamond shells based on increasing Manhattan distance `d` from the marker.
3.  At each distance `d`, identify the set of coordinates exactly at that distance.
4.  Filter this set to include only coordinates that fall within the grid boundaries *and* belong to the set of `interior_primary_pixels`.
5.  Collect all such valid pattern pixels across all distances `d` where intersections occur.
6.  Update the output grid:
    *   Preserve border pixels (copy from input).
    *   Color the collected pattern pixels with the `marker_color`.
    *   Set the original `marker_coord` pixel to white (0).
    *   Set all `interior_primary_pixels` that were *not* colored by the pattern to white (0).
    *   Preserve all pixels outside the processed shapes.

## Metrics

Metrics were calculated using `tool_code` above for Example 1. Similar analysis can be applied to Examples 2 and 3.

**Example 1 (Summary):**
*   Input: Green rectangle (primary=3) with one magenta marker (6) at (2, 9).
*   Expected Output: Green border preserved. Hollow diamond pattern (magenta=6) expands from (2, 9) onto interior green pixels. Marker location (2, 9) and other interior green pixels not part of the diamond pattern are cleared (white=0).
*   Failed Output: Green border preserved. Marker location (2, 9) cleared. *All* interior green pixels colored magenta (6).

**Example 2 (Visual Inspection):**
*   Input: Red square (primary=2) with one blue marker (1) at (2, 2).
*   Expected Output: Red border preserved. Hollow diamond pattern (blue=1) expands from (2, 2) onto interior red pixels. Marker location (2, 2) and other interior red pixels not part of the diamond pattern are cleared (white=0). The pattern appears slightly more complex but follows the same principle.
*   Failed Output: Red border preserved. Marker location (2, 2) cleared. *All* interior red pixels colored blue (1).

**Example 3 (Visual Inspection):**
*   Input: Two shapes.
    *   Shape 1: Blue rectangle (primary=1) with one red marker (2) at (6, 8).
    *   Shape 2: Green rectangle (primary=3) with one red marker (2) at (2, 15).
    *   Shape 3: Yellow rectangle (primary=4) with one green marker (3) at (14, 7).
*   Expected Output: Each shape transformed independently following the hollow diamond rule. Borders preserved, pattern drawn with marker color onto interior pixels, marker location and unused interior pixels cleared.
*   Failed Output: Borders preserved, markers cleared, *all* interior pixels colored with respective marker colors.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Target Shapes:** Scan the input grid to find all distinct connected areas (shapes) composed of non-white pixels (using 4-directional adjacency).
2.  **Analyze Each Shape:** For each shape found:
    a.  Count the occurrences of each non-white color within the shape.
    b.  If the shape contains pixels of more than one non-white color, determine the `primary_color` (the most frequent non-white color).
    c.  Identify all pixels within the shape that are *not* the `primary_color` and are *not* white. These are potential 'markers'.
    d.  If there is *exactly one* such marker pixel in the shape, proceed to transform this shape. Otherwise, leave the shape unchanged.
3.  **Prepare for Transformation:** For each shape identified in step 2d:
    a.  Note the marker's coordinate (`marker_coord`) and color (`marker_color`).
    b.  Identify all pixels belonging to the `primary_color` within the shape (`primary_pixels`).
    c.  Determine the `border_pixels`: these are `primary_pixels` that are adjacent (4-directionally) to any pixel outside the shape (including grid boundaries or white pixels).
    d.  Determine the `interior_pixels`: these are `primary_pixels` that are *not* `border_pixels`.
4.  **Generate Pattern and Update:**
    a.  Create the output grid, initially as a copy of the input grid.
    b.  Initialize an empty set `pattern_pixels_to_color`.
    c.  Start with Manhattan distance `d = 1` from the `marker_coord`.
    d.  **Loop:**
        i.  Find all coordinates `(r, c)` that are exactly at Manhattan distance `d` from `marker_coord`.
        ii. Filter this set of coordinates, keeping only those that are within the grid boundaries *and* are present in the set of `interior_pixels`.
        iii. If the filtered set is empty (the diamond shell no longer intersects the interior), stop the loop (break).
        iv. Add the coordinates from the filtered set to `pattern_pixels_to_color`.
        v.  Increment `d`.
    e.  Modify the output grid for the current shape:
        i.  For every coordinate `(r, c)` in `pattern_pixels_to_color`, set `output_grid[r, c] = marker_color`.
        ii. For every coordinate `(r, c)` in `interior_pixels` that is *not* in `pattern_pixels_to_color`, set `output_grid[r, c] = 0` (white).
        iii. Set `output_grid[marker_coord] = 0` (white).
    f.  (`border_pixels` remain unchanged as they were copied initially and not modified in steps i-iii. Pixels outside processed shapes also remain unchanged).
5.  **Final Output:** Return the modified output grid after processing all qualifying shapes.
