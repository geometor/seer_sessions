"""
Identifies contiguous shapes of a single non-white color in the input grid. 
For each shape, it checks if it contains exactly one 'marker' pixel of a different color.
If a marker is found, a diamond-shaped boundary pattern is drawn expanding outwards from the marker's location using the marker's color. 
The pattern only colors pixels that originally belonged to the shape (had the shape's primary color). 
The expansion stops when the pattern reaches pixels that were not part of the original shape.
All pixels that originally belonged to the shape but were not colored by the diamond pattern (including the original marker pixel) are then set to white (0).
Shapes without a marker remain unchanged.
