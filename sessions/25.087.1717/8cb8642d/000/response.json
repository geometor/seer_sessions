            "text": "*   **Perception:** The input grids contain one or more large, roughly rectangular objects composed of a single color, potentially with one pixel of a different color inside them ('marker pixel'). The background is white (0). The output grids show that the interior of objects containing a marker pixel is modified. A pattern, resembling the boundary of a diamond or rotated square, is drawn using the marker pixel's color. This pattern expands outwards from the original marker location until it hits the boundary of the original object. The pixels inside this drawn pattern, including the original marker location, are changed to white (0). Pixels that were originally part of the object but are outside the drawn pattern are also changed to white (0). Objects without a marker pixel remain unchanged. The size and color of the objects and markers vary across examples.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

For each shape, record its primary color, and the set of coordinates it occupies.\n    2.  For each identified shape, scan its constituent pixels in the input grid to find if there is exactly one pixel ('marker') with a color different from the shape's primary color. Record the marker's color and its coordinates (marker\\_row, marker\\_col) if found.\n    3.  Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.\n    4.  For each shape that was found to have a marker:\n        a.  Initialize a set of `pixels_to_clear` containing all coordinates belonging to the shape in the input.\n        b.  Initialize a set `pixels_colored_by_pattern`.\n        c.  Iterate through increasing Manhattan distances `d` (starting from `d=1`) from the marker's coordinates (marker\\_row, marker\\_col).\n        d.  For each distance `d`, find all coordinates (r, c) such that `abs(r - marker_row) + abs(c - marker_col) == d`.\n        e.  For each coordinate (r, c) found in step 4d:\n            i.  Check if (r, c) is within the grid bounds.\n            ii. Check if the pixel at (r, c) in the *input* grid originally belonged to the current shape (i.e., its color was the shape's primary color).\n            iii. If both checks pass, change the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the *output* grid to the marker's color, and add (r,c) to the `pixels_colored_by_pattern` set.\n        f.  Stop increasing `d` when no more pixels meeting the criteria in step 4e(ii) can be colored for a given distance `d`.\n        g.  Remove all coordinates present in `pixels_colored_by_pattern` from the `pixels_to_clear` set.\n        h.  For every remaining coordinate (r, c) in the `pixels_to_clear` set, change the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the *output* grid to white (0). This includes the original marker location.\n    5.  Return the modified output grid. Shapes that did not have a marker remain unchanged from the initial copy (step 3)."
