            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified shapes composed of a primary color and containing exactly one pixel of a different \"marker\" color. However, it failed to accurately implement the transformation rule observed in the examples. The primary issues were:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Coloring:** The code colored almost the entire shape with the marker color, instead of just the pixels forming the diamond pattern.\n2.  **Border Preservation:** The original border pixels of the shape were incorrectly modified, whereas the expected output shows they should retain their original primary color.\n3.  **Interior Clearing:** The logic for clearing the interior pixels (those not part of the border and not part of the diamond pattern) was flawed, leading to incorrect pixels being set to white (0) or not being cleared when they should have been. The marker pixel itself also needs to be cleared.\n4.  **Diamond Expansion Termination:** The condition for stopping the diamond expansion might have been incorrect, potentially expanding too far or stopping too early. The expansion should likely continue as long as the pattern intersects with the shape's original area and stop when it goes beyond or completely fills the available space within the border.\n\nThe strategy to resolve these errors involves:\n1.  Explicitly identifying the border pixels of the shape.\n2.  Refining the diamond pattern generation: color only the pixels on the diamond path that fall within the original shape's primary color area.\n3.  Implementing the correct clearing logic: After drawing the diamond pattern, iterate through the shape's original primary-colored pixels. If a pixel is *not* on the border and *not* colored by the diamond pattern, set it to white (0). Also, set the original marker position to white (0).\n4.  Ensuring the border pixels retain their original primary color throughout the process.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the first example to illustrate the discrepancies and the required logic.\n\n**Example 1 Input:**\n"
