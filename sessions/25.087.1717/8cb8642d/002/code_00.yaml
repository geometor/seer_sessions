Task: Draw a hollow diamond pattern inside marked shapes.

Input_Features:
  - Grids containing contiguous shapes of uniform color (primary_color), potentially embedded with pixels of other colors.
  - Background is white (0).
  - Shapes are defined by 4-directional connectivity of non-white pixels.

Output_Features:
  - Grids where specific shapes have been modified.
  - Shapes without a single, unique internal marker pixel remain unchanged.

Transformation_Objects:
  - Shape: A contiguous area of pixels sharing the same non-white color (primary_color).
  - Marker: A single pixel of a different color (marker_color) located within or adjacent to the primary_color pixels of a shape, such that the marker and the primary pixels form one connected component (including the marker).
  - Border: The subset of a shape's primary_color pixels that are adjacent (4-directionally) to pixels not belonging to that shape (background or another shape, excluding the marker pixel itself during adjacency check).
  - Interior: The subset of a shape's primary_color pixels that are not part of the Border.
  - Diamond_Pattern: A diamond shape (defined by Manhattan distance) centered at the Marker's position.

Actions:
  1. Identify: Find all connected components of non-white pixels.
  2. Analyze_Components: For each component, determine if it consists of a primary_color area and exactly one marker_color pixel.
  3. Identify_Border: For qualifying shapes, determine the Border pixels.
  4. Generate_Pattern: Create a Diamond_Pattern expanding outwards from the Marker position layer by layer (increasing Manhattan distance).
  5. Apply_Pattern: For each pixel generated by the Diamond_Pattern, if it falls within the shape's original primary_color area, change its color to the marker_color in the output grid. Keep track of pixels changed by the pattern.
  6. Preserve_Border: Ensure all identified Border pixels retain their original primary_color in the output grid.
  7. Clear_Interior: For all pixels originally belonging to the shape's primary_color area: if a pixel is not a Border pixel and was not colored by the Apply_Pattern step, change its color to white (0) in the output grid.
  8. Clear_Marker: Change the color of the original Marker pixel's location to white (0) in the output grid.
  9. No_Change: If a shape does not have exactly one marker, or if a component is just a single pixel or doesn't fit the criteria, leave it unchanged in the output grid.
