task_type: object_transformation
objects:
  - name: shape
    description: A contiguous area of pixels of the same non-white color (primary_color). Must contain exactly one pixel of a different non-white color (marker_pixel).
    properties:
      primary_color: The most frequent non-white color in the contiguous component.
      marker_pixel:
        coordinate: (row, col)
        color: A non-white color different from the primary_color.
      border_pixels: Pixels of the primary_color adjacent (4-directionally) to pixels outside the shape component or the grid boundary.
      interior_pixels: Pixels of the primary_color that are not border_pixels.
      all_pixels: Set of all coordinates belonging to the connected component.
actions:
  - name: identify_shapes
    description: Find all connected components of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - name: filter_shapes
    description: Select only those shapes that have a single marker_pixel. Shapes not meeting this criterion remain unchanged.
  - name: process_filtered_shapes
    description: Apply transformations to the selected shapes.
    sub_actions:
      - name: preserve_border
        description: Keep the border_pixels of the shape unchanged (retain their primary_color).
      - name: generate_hollow_diamond
        description: Create a hollow diamond pattern centered at the marker_pixel's coordinate.
        details:
          - The pattern uses the marker_pixel's color.
          - It expands outwards layer by layer based on Manhattan distance (d=1, 2, 3...).
          - A layer consists of all pixels exactly at the current Manhattan distance `d` from the marker_pixel's coordinate.
          - Only pixels belonging to the shape's original interior_pixels set can be colored by the diamond pattern.
          - The expansion stops when a layer contains no pixels that overlap with the shape's original interior_pixels.
          - The final pattern consists of all pixels successfully colored during the expansion.
      - name: clear_interior
        description: Set the color of pixels within the shape's original interior_pixels that are *not* part of the generated hollow diamond pattern to white (0).
      - name: clear_marker
        description: Set the color of the original marker_pixel's coordinate to white (0).
input_output_relation:
  - For each shape identified and filtered:
      1. Copy the input grid to the output grid.
      2. Identify the shape's components (border, interior, marker).
      3. Generate the hollow diamond pattern using the marker color, coloring only original interior pixels.
      4. Update the output grid with the diamond pattern pixels.
      5. Update the output grid by setting non-diamond interior pixels to white (0).
      6. Update the output grid by setting the original marker pixel location to white (0).
      7. Border pixels are implicitly preserved as they were copied and not modified.
  - Pixels not part of any identified and filtered shape remain unchanged.
