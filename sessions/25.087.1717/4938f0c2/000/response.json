            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects made of contiguous pixels of the same color, primarily red (2) and green (3), on a white (0) background.\n2.  **Key Objects:** The green (3) object seems to play a crucial role. In the examples where a transformation occurs (train\\_1, train\\_2), the green object is a 2x2 square. The red (2) object(s) are the ones being transformed.\n3.  **Transformation:** In examples 1 and 2, the red object is replicated through reflections. The transformation appears to be a four-fold rotational symmetry (or equivalently, reflections across horizontal and vertical axes) centered around the green 2x2 square.\n4.  **Center of Symmetry:** The center of the 2x2 green square acts as the center point for the reflections. If the green square occupies rows `r` and `r+1`, and columns `c` and `c+1`, the center of symmetry is effectively at `(r + 0.5, c + 0.5)`.\n5.  **Conditions:** The transformation only occurs when specific conditions are met. In example 3, there is a 2x2 green square, but there are *two* distinct red objects. In this case, no transformation occurs, and the output is identical to the input. This suggests the transformation might require *exactly one* 2x2 green square and *exactly one* red object.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
