Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects made of contiguous pixels of the same color, primarily red (2) and green (3), on a white (0) background.
2.  **Key Objects:** The green (3) object seems to play a crucial role. In the examples where a transformation occurs (train\_1, train\_2), the green object is a 2x2 square. The red (2) object(s) are the ones being transformed.
3.  **Transformation:** In examples 1 and 2, the red object is replicated through reflections. The transformation appears to be a four-fold rotational symmetry (or equivalently, reflections across horizontal and vertical axes) centered around the green 2x2 square.
4.  **Center of Symmetry:** The center of the 2x2 green square acts as the center point for the reflections. If the green square occupies rows `r` and `r+1`, and columns `c` and `c+1`, the center of symmetry is effectively at `(r + 0.5, c + 0.5)`.
5.  **Conditions:** The transformation only occurs when specific conditions are met. In example 3, there is a 2x2 green square, but there are *two* distinct red objects. In this case, no transformation occurs, and the output is identical to the input. This suggests the transformation might require *exactly one* 2x2 green square and *exactly one* red object.

**YAML Facts:**

  - name: construct_output
    description: >
      If the conditions (exactly one 2x2 green object, exactly one red object) are met,
      create the output grid by taking the input grid and adding the three sets of reflected red pixels.
      If the conditions are not met, the output grid is identical to the input grid.

relationships:
  - The green object acts as the anchor and defines the center for the reflection operations on the red object.
  - The transformation (reflection) is conditional on the number and shape of the green and red objects.

constraints:
  - Reflected pixels falling outside the grid boundaries are ignored.
  - If reflected pixels overlap with existing pixels, the red color takes precedence over white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid.
2.  Identify all separate contiguous objects of green pixels (color 3) and red pixels (color 2).
3.  Count the number of green objects found.
4.  Count the number of red objects found.
5.  Check if there is exactly one green object. If not, copy the input grid to the output grid and stop.
6.  Check if the single green object consists of exactly four pixels arranged in a 2x2 square. If not, copy the input grid to the output grid and stop.
7.  Check if there is exactly one red object. If not, copy the input grid to the output grid and stop.
8.  If all checks pass (one 2x2 green object, one red object):
    a.  Determine the coordinates of the four pixels of the green square. Let the minimum row be `min_r` and minimum column be `min_c`. The center of symmetry is `center_row = min_r + 0.5` and `center_col = min_c + 0.5`.
    b.  Identify all pixel coordinates `(r, c)` belonging to the single red object.
    c.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
    d.  For each pixel `(r, c)` of the red object:
        i.  Calculate the horizontal reflection coordinates: `reflected_row_h = round(2 * center_row - r)`, `reflected_col_h = c`.
        ii. Calculate the vertical reflection coordinates: `reflected_row_v = r`, `reflected_col_v = round(2 * center_col - c)`.
        iii. Calculate the center point reflection coordinates: `reflected_row_c = round(2 * center_row - r)`, `reflected_col_c = round(2 * center_col - c)`.
        iv.  For each calculated coordinate pair `(rr, cc)` (from i, ii, and iii), if it falls within the grid boundaries, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to red (color 2).
9.  The final output grid is ready.
