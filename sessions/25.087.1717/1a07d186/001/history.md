Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Static Elements:** Each input grid contains one or more horizontal or vertical lines composed of a single, non-white color. These lines appear unchanged in the output grids. In example 1, there's a red horizontal line and a blue horizontal line. In example 2, there's a green vertical line and a yellow vertical line. In example 3, there's a single azure horizontal line.
2.  **Mobile Elements:** Besides the lines and the white background, there are several single, non-white pixels scattered across the input grids. These are the elements that change position or disappear in the output.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve these single pixels moving towards the line of the *same color*.
    *   A pixel finds the nearest line (measured perpendicularly) that matches its own color.
    *   It then moves towards that line, stopping exactly one pixel away from it, on the same side it started.
    *   If a pixel's color does not match any of the line colors present in the grid, that pixel is removed (becomes white).
    *   If the direct path (horizontal or vertical) between the pixel's starting position and its target position (exclusive of endpoints) intersects *any* line, the pixel is removed instead of moving.
4.  **Output Construction:** The output grid retains the original lines and background. The single pixels are either removed or repositioned according to the rules above.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Move single pixels towards the nearest line of the same color, stopping one step away, unless the path is blocked by any line or no same-colored line exists.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties: contains background, lines, and single pixels.
  - type: background
    properties: color white (0), static.
  - type: line
    properties:
      - horizontal or vertical contiguous segment of 2+ identical non-white pixels.
      - acts as an attractor for same-colored single pixels.
      - acts as an obstacle for moving pixels.
      - static (position and color unchanged in output).
  - type: single_pixel (agent)
    properties:
      - single non-white pixel not part of a line.
      - has a color and position.
      - potentially mobile or removable.

relationships_and_actions:
  - action: identify_lines
    description: Find all horizontal and vertical lines (color, orientation, position).
  - action: identify_agents
    description: Find all single non-white pixels not part of lines (color, position).
  - for_each: agent
    conditions:
      - check: find nearest line (L_nearest) with the same color (C) as the agent.
      - if: no such line exists
        action: remove agent (change to white).
      - else:
        action: calculate target position (T) one step away from L_nearest on the agent's side.
        action: check path between agent's start position (P) and T.
        conditions:
          - if: path intersects *any* identified line
            action: remove agent (change to white).
          - else:
            action: move agent C from P to T in the output grid.
            note: Original lines remain in the output grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid. Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input.
2.  Identify all horizontal and vertical lines (segments of at least two identical, non-white pixels). Note their color, orientation (horizontal/vertical), and position (row/column index). These lines will remain fixed in the output grid and act as obstacles/attractors.
3.  Identify all single, non-white pixels in the input grid that are not part of the identified lines. These are the 'agent' pixels. Note their color and original position (row, column).
4.  Temporarily remove all identified agent pixels from the *output* grid (set their original positions to white).
5.  For each identified agent pixel (with color `C` at original position `P=(r, c)`):
    a.  Search for lines identified in step 2 that have the same color `C`.
    b.  If no lines with color `C` exist, this agent pixel is permanently removed (it remains white in the output grid). Proceed to the next agent pixel.
    c.  If one or more lines with color `C` exist, find the one (`L_nearest`) whose position (row index for horizontal, column index for vertical) is closest to the agent's position (`r` for horizontal lines, `c` for vertical lines). Calculate the distance perpendicularly.
    d.  Determine the target position `T`:
        *   If `L_nearest` is horizontal at row `idx_row`: Target `T` is (`idx_row - 1`, `c`) if `r < idx_row`, or (`idx_row + 1`, `c`) if `r > idx_row`.
        *   If `L_nearest` is vertical at column `idx_col`: Target `T` is (`r`, `idx_col - 1`) if `c < idx_col`, or (`r`, `idx_col + 1`) if `c > idx_col`.
    e.  Check the path: Examine all grid cells strictly between `P` and `T`. If any of these cells in the *input* grid contains a pixel belonging to *any* line identified in step 2, then the path is blocked.
    f.  If the path is blocked, the agent pixel is permanently removed (remains white).
    g.  If the path is clear, place the agent pixel's color `C` at the target position `T` in the output grid. (If multiple agents target the same cell, the last one processed determines the final color).
6.  The final output grid contains the original lines and the agent pixels repositioned or removed according to these rules.
