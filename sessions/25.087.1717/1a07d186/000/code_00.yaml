task_description: Move single pixels towards the nearest line of the same color, stopping one step away, unless the path is blocked by any line or no same-colored line exists.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties: contains background, lines, and single pixels.
  - type: background
    properties: color white (0), static.
  - type: line
    properties:
      - horizontal or vertical contiguous segment of 2+ identical non-white pixels.
      - acts as an attractor for same-colored single pixels.
      - acts as an obstacle for moving pixels.
      - static (position and color unchanged in output).
  - type: single_pixel (agent)
    properties:
      - single non-white pixel not part of a line.
      - has a color and position.
      - potentially mobile or removable.

relationships_and_actions:
  - action: identify_lines
    description: Find all horizontal and vertical lines (color, orientation, position).
  - action: identify_agents
    description: Find all single non-white pixels not part of lines (color, position).
  - for_each: agent
    conditions:
      - check: find nearest line (L_nearest) with the same color (C) as the agent.
      - if: no such line exists
        action: remove agent (change to white).
      - else:
        action: calculate target position (T) one step away from L_nearest on the agent's side.
        action: check path between agent's start position (P) and T.
        conditions:
          - if: path intersects *any* identified line
            action: remove agent (change to white).
          - else:
            action: move agent C from P to T in the output grid.
            note: Original lines remain in the output grid.
