These bands can be arranged either horizontally or vertically, dividing the grid.\n2.  **Key Feature:** Within these solid color bands, there are isolated single pixels of white (color 0).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves these white pixels \"expanding\" or \"projecting\" within their respective color bands.\n4.  **Orientation Dependence:** The direction of expansion depends on the orientation of the color bands:\n    *   If the bands are horizontal (stacked vertically), the white pixels expand vertically into white columns *within the confines of their original band*.\n    *   If the bands are vertical (arranged side-by-side), the white pixels expand horizontally into white rows *within the confines of their original band*.\n5.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the original band structure, but the areas affected by the white pixel expansion are now entirely white. The original non-white colors remain in the unaffected parts of their bands.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
