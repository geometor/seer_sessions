task_description: Expand white 'defect' pixels within monochromatic bands based on band orientation.
elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - element: band
    description: A large, contiguous rectangular region of a single non-white color. Bands divide the grid either horizontally or vertically.
    properties:
      - orientation: horizontal | vertical (Determined by whether color boundaries are primarily horizontal or vertical lines)
      - color: The single non-white color filling the band.
      - boundaries: The row and column ranges defining the band's extent.
  - element: defect
    description: A single white pixel (color 0) located within a non-white color band.
    properties:
      - location: (row, column) coordinates.
      - parent_band: The band within which the defect resides.
actions:
  - action: determine_band_orientation
    description: Analyze the input grid to determine if the color bands are arranged horizontally or vertically. This is done by checking if boundaries between different non-white colors occur only along horizontal lines or only along vertical lines.
  - action: identify_bands_and_defects
    description: Locate all monochromatic bands and the white defects within them. Associate each defect with its parent band.
  - action: project_defects
    description: Modify the grid based on defect locations and band orientation.
    conditions:
      - if: band orientation is horizontal
        effect: For each defect, change all pixels in the same column to white, but only within the row range of the defect's parent band.
      - if: band orientation is vertical
        effect: For each defect, change all pixels in the same row to white, but only within the column range of the defect's parent band.
relationships:
  - relationship: defect_in_band
    description: Each white defect pixel exists within a specific monochromatic band.
  - relationship: projection_direction_follows_orientation
    description: Vertical bands lead to horizontal projection of defects; horizontal bands lead to vertical projection of defects.
  - relationship: projection_contained_within_band
    description: The expansion/projection of a defect is strictly limited to the boundaries of its parent band.
