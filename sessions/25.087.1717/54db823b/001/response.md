"""
Identify all distinct objects (connected components of non-white pixels, which are green (3) or maroon (9)).
For each object, examine its maroon (9) pixels.
A maroon pixel is considered 'internal' if all four of its cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are within the grid boundaries AND are part of the same object (i.e., are green or maroon).
A maroon pixel is considered 'external' if it has at least one neighbor that is white (0) or outside the grid boundaries.
Find the unique object where *all* of its maroon pixels are internal.
Create the output grid by copying the input grid, then changing all pixels (both green and maroon) belonging to the identified object to white (0).
