Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

### Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids feature a larger grid divided into smaller, equal-sized cells (4x4 pixels) by single-pixel-thick lines. The color of these lines is consistent within each example but differs between examples (Green in `train_1`, Azure in `train_2`). These separator lines remain unchanged in the output.
2.  **Cell Content:** Within the 4x4 cells, the input grids contain small, colored shapes (typically 2x2 squares) and background pixels (White). These shapes are usually located in the top-left, middle-left, or bottom-left cells. Some cells might contain other scattered pixels (Magenta in `train_1`, Gray in `train_2`), which appear irrelevant to the output.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation happens within the rows of 4x4 cells. The non-separator, non-white color found in the *first* 4x4 cell of a row dictates the changes for *all* 4x4 cells in that same row.
4.  **Color Application:** The color from the shape in the first cell ("paint color") is applied to specific relative positions within every 4x4 cell of that row. These positions include:
    *   The original positions of the shape found in the first cell.
    *   A fixed set of three additional relative positions: `(1,0)`, `(1,3)`, and `(3,2)` (using 0-based indexing relative to the top-left corner of the 4x4 cell), but only if these positions were originally White (0).
5.  **Row Independence:** The transformation applied to one row of 4x4 cells does not affect other rows. If a row's first cell contains no distinct shape color (only background or separator color), that row remains unchanged (except for the separator lines).

### Facts


```yaml
Data:
  - Input: grid_i
  - Output: grid_o

Grid Structure:
  - Property: Divided into subgrids by separator lines.
  - Separator Lines:
    - Property: Single pixel thick, horizontal and vertical.
    - Property: Consistent color within a single task example (e.g., Green, Azure).
    - Property: Location defines subgrids (appears to be 4x4 pixel areas).
    - Relation: Remain unchanged between input and output.
  - Subgrids (Cells):
    - Property: Appear to be 4x4 pixels in size.
    - Property: Arranged in rows and columns.

Objects:
  - Type: Shape
    - Location: Resides within a subgrid (cell).
    - Property: Composed of a single, non-background, non-separator color (e.g., Yellow, Red, Azure, Blue).
    - Property: Size/Form: Often 2x2 squares in the examples.
    - Role: Acts as the source of "paint color" and pattern for a row of cells.
    - Identifier: Typically found in the first cell (leftmost) of a row of cells.
  - Type: Background Pixel
    - Property: White color (0).
  - Type: Separator Pixel
    - Property: Color identifies grid lines (e.g., Green, Azure).
  - Type: Other Pixels
    - Property: Colors like Magenta, Gray appear in some inputs.
    - Role: Seemingly irrelevant to the transformation.

Transformation:
  - Scope: Applied independently to each row of subgrids (cells).
  - Trigger: Presence of a unique Shape object (non-background, non-separator color) in the first cell of a cell row.
  - Action (Per Row):
    1. Identify the "paint color" (C) and relative coordinates (`ShapeCoords`) of the Shape object in the first cell of the row.
    2. Define fixed target relative coordinates: `TargetCoords = {(1,0), (1,3), (3,2)}`.
    3. For *every* cell in the current row:
       - Copy the cell from the input to the output initially.
       - Update pixels at `ShapeCoords` within the cell to color `C`.
       - Update pixels at `TargetCoords` within the cell to color `C` *only if* the original pixel was White (0).
  - Invariant: Separator lines remain unchanged. Cells in rows where the first cell has no Shape object remain unchanged.

Relationships:
  - The transformation in a cell depends on the Shape found in the *first* cell of its row.
  - All cells within the same row undergo the *same* pattern modification based on that first cell's Shape.
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  **Identify Grid Structure:**
    *   Scan the input grid to find the color (`SeparatorColor`) used for the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the grid.
    *   Determine the locations (row and column indices) of these separator lines.
    *   Infer the size of the subgrids (cells) delimited by these lines (e.g., 4x4).
3.  **Process Rows of Cells:** Iterate through the grid based on the rows of cells identified (e.g., rows 0-3 form the first cell row, rows 5-8 form the second, etc.). Let the starting row index of the current cell row be `R_start`.
4.  **Analyze First Cell of the Row:**
    *   Focus on the first cell in the current row (columns 0 to cell_width-1, e.g., 0-3).
    *   Search within this cell `[R_start : R_start + cell_height, 0 : cell_width]` for a pixel whose color is *not* White (0) and *not* the `SeparatorColor`.
    *   If such a color (`PaintColor`) is found:
        a.  Record `PaintColor`.
        b.  Find all relative coordinates `(r, c)` (where `0 <= r < cell_height`, `0 <= c < cell_width`) within this first cell that contain `PaintColor`. Store these as `ShapeCoords`.
        c.  Define the fixed target relative coordinates `TargetCoords = {(1,0), (1,3), (3,2)}` (assuming 4x4 cells).
        d.  **Apply Transformation Across the Row:** Iterate through all cells in the current cell row (cycling through column starting positions `C_start`). For each cell:
            i.  For each coordinate `(r, c)` in `ShapeCoords`: Set the pixel in the output grid at `(R_start + r, C_start + c)` to `PaintColor`.
            ii. For each coordinate `(r, c)` in `TargetCoords`: Check the pixel in the *input* grid at `(R_start + r, C_start + c)`. If it is White (0), set the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid at `(R_start + r, C_start + c)` to `PaintColor`.
    *   If no `PaintColor` is found in the first cell, proceed to the next row of cells without modifying the current row in the output grid (it remains as copied from the input).
5.  **Finalize:** The modified output grid is the result.
