"""
The transformation operates on a grid composed of 4x4 cells separated by 1-pixel thick lines of a single 'separator_color'.

1.  **Identify Grid Structure**: Determine the cell size (4x4) and separator thickness (1). Find the 'separator_color'.
2.  **Determine Output Pattern**: Based on the identified 'separator_color', select a fixed pattern of relative coordinates within a 4x4 cell.
    *   If separator_color is 3 (Green), the pattern is `{(1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)}`.
    *   If separator_color is 8 (Azure), the pattern is `{(0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1)}`.
    *   If the separator_color is different, the behavior is undefined by the examples (assume no change or error).
3.  **Process Rows**: Iterate through each row of cells (steps of 5 pixels vertically).
4.  **Find Paint Color**: In the first cell of the current row, find the first non-background (0) and non-separator color. This is the 'paint_color' for the row. Ignore the actual shape formed by this color.
5.  **Apply Pattern**: If a 'paint_color' is found for the row:
    *   Iterate through all cells in that row (steps of 5 pixels horizontally).
    *   For each cell, overwrite the pixels at the relative coordinates specified by the selected 'output_pattern' with the 'paint_color'. Existing pixels at these locations are overwritten.
6.  **Maintain Separators**: Separator lines and cells in rows where no 'paint_color' was found in the first cell remain unchanged.
