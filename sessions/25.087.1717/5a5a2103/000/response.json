            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids feature a larger grid divided into smaller, equal-sized cells (4x4 pixels) by single-pixel-thick lines. The color of these lines is consistent within each example but differs between examples (Green in `train_1`, Azure in `train_2`). These separator lines remain unchanged in the output.\n2.  **Cell Content:** Within the 4x4 cells, the input grids contain small, colored shapes (typically 2x2 squares) and background pixels (White). These shapes are usually located in the top-left, middle-left, or bottom-left cells. Some cells might contain other scattered pixels (Magenta in `train_1`, Gray in `train_2`), which appear irrelevant to the output.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation happens within the rows of 4x4 cells. The non-separator, non-white color found in the *first* 4x4 cell of a row dictates the changes for *all* 4x4 cells in that same row.\n4.  **Color Application:** The color from the shape in the first cell (\"paint color\") is applied to specific relative positions within every 4x4 cell of that row. These positions include:\n    *   The original positions of the shape found in the first cell.\n    *   A fixed set of three additional relative positions: `(1,0)`, `(1,3)`, and `(3,2)` (using 0-based indexing relative to the top-left corner of the 4x4 cell), but only if these positions were originally White (0).\n5.  **Row Independence:** The transformation applied to one row of 4x4 cells does not affect other rows. If a row's first cell contains no distinct shape color (only background or separator color), that row remains unchanged (except for the separator lines).\n\n### Facts\n\n"

Let the starting row index of the current cell row be `R_start`.\n4.  **Analyze First Cell of the Row:**\n    *   Focus on the first cell in the current row (columns 0 to cell_width-1, e.g., 0-3).\n    *   Search within this cell `[R_start : R_start + cell_height, 0 : cell_width]` for a pixel whose color is *not* White (0) and *not* the `SeparatorColor`.\n    *   If such a color (`PaintColor`) is found:\n        a.  Record `PaintColor`.\n        b.  Find all relative coordinates `(r, c)` (where `0 <= r < cell_height`, `0 <= c < cell_width`) within this first cell that contain `PaintColor`. Store these as `ShapeCoords`.\n        c.  Define the fixed target relative coordinates `TargetCoords = {(1,0), (1,3), (3,2)}` (assuming 4x4 cells).\n        d.  **Apply Transformation Across the Row:** Iterate through all cells in the current cell row (cycling through column starting positions `C_start`). For each cell:\n            i.  For each coordinate `(r, c)` in `ShapeCoords`: Set the pixel in the output grid at `(R_start + r, C_start + c)` to `PaintColor`.\n            ii. For each coordinate `(r, c)` in `TargetCoords`: Check the pixel in the *input* grid at `(R_start + r, C_start + c)`. If it is White (0), set the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid at `(R_start + r, C_start + c)` to `PaintColor`.\n    *   If no `PaintColor` is found in the first cell, proceed to the next row of cells without modifying the current row in the output grid (it remains as copied from the input).\n5.  **Finalize:** The modified output grid is the result."
