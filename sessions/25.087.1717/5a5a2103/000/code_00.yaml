Data:
  - Input: grid_i
  - Output: grid_o

Grid Structure:
  - Property: Divided into subgrids by separator lines.
  - Separator Lines:
    - Property: Single pixel thick, horizontal and vertical.
    - Property: Consistent color within a single task example (e.g., Green, Azure).
    - Property: Location defines subgrids (appears to be 4x4 pixel areas).
    - Relation: Remain unchanged between input and output.
  - Subgrids (Cells):
    - Property: Appear to be 4x4 pixels in size.
    - Property: Arranged in rows and columns.

Objects:
  - Type: Shape
    - Location: Resides within a subgrid (cell).
    - Property: Composed of a single, non-background, non-separator color (e.g., Yellow, Red, Azure, Blue).
    - Property: Size/Form: Often 2x2 squares in the examples.
    - Role: Acts as the source of "paint color" and pattern for a row of cells.
    - Identifier: Typically found in the first cell (leftmost) of a row of cells.
  - Type: Background Pixel
    - Property: White color (0).
  - Type: Separator Pixel
    - Property: Color identifies grid lines (e.g., Green, Azure).
  - Type: Other Pixels
    - Property: Colors like Magenta, Gray appear in some inputs.
    - Role: Seemingly irrelevant to the transformation.

Transformation:
  - Scope: Applied independently to each row of subgrids (cells).
  - Trigger: Presence of a unique Shape object (non-background, non-separator color) in the first cell of a cell row.
  - Action (Per Row):
    1. Identify the "paint color" (C) and relative coordinates (`ShapeCoords`) of the Shape object in the first cell of the row.
    2. Define fixed target relative coordinates: `TargetCoords = {(1,0), (1,3), (3,2)}`.
    3. For *every* cell in the current row:
       - Copy the cell from the input to the output initially.
       - Update pixels at `ShapeCoords` within the cell to color `C`.
       - Update pixels at `TargetCoords` within the cell to color `C` *only if* the original pixel was White (0).
  - Invariant: Separator lines remain unchanged. Cells in rows where the first cell has no Shape object remain unchanged.

Relationships:
  - The transformation in a cell depends on the Shape found in the *first* cell of its row.
  - All cells within the same row undergo the *same* pattern modification based on that first cell's Shape.
