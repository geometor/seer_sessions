The blue pixels often appear as vertical lines or isolated points. The red pixels form various shapes or blocks. The core transformation seems to involve the blue pixels influencing the red pixels located vertically below them. Specifically, red pixels in a column below the highest blue pixel in that same column are changed to blue. Red pixels above the highest blue pixel or in columns without any blue pixels remain unchanged. White pixels are unaffected.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Remains in the output.\n  - Red (2): The target of the transformation. Can change to blue (1).\nObjects:\n  - Pixels: Individual cells in the grid.\n  - Columns: Vertical sets of pixels.\n  - Red Shapes: Contiguous areas of red pixels.\n  - Blue Triggers: Individual blue pixels or vertical lines of blue pixels.\nRelationships:\n  - Vertical Alignment: Pixels sharing the same column index.\n  - Position: 'Above' or 'Below' within the same column.\nTransformation:\n  - Action: Changing the color of specific red pixels to blue.\n  - Condition: The change occurs only for red pixels that are in the same column as a blue pixel and are located vertically below the *highest* blue pixel in that column.\n  - Scope: The transformation is applied independently to each column.\n```"
