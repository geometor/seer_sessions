Grid:
  - Input: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - Output: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - Size: Variable, up to 30x30.
Colors:
  - White (0): Background color, generally unchanged.
  - Blue (1): Acts as the trigger/agent for the transformation. Remains in the output.
  - Red (2): The target of the transformation. Can change to blue (1).
Objects:
  - Pixels: Individual cells in the grid.
  - Columns: Vertical sets of pixels.
  - Red Shapes: Contiguous areas of red pixels.
  - Blue Triggers: Individual blue pixels or vertical lines of blue pixels.
Relationships:
  - Vertical Alignment: Pixels sharing the same column index.
  - Position: 'Above' or 'Below' within the same column.
Transformation:
  - Action: Changing the color of specific red pixels to blue.
  - Condition: The change occurs only for red pixels that are in the same column as a blue pixel and are located vertically below the *highest* blue pixel in that column.
  - Scope: The transformation is applied independently to each column.
