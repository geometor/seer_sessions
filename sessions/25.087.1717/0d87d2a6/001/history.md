**Perception of the Task Elements:**

The input and output grids consist primarily of white (0), blue (1), and red (2) pixels. The blue pixels often appear as vertical lines or isolated points. The red pixels form various shapes or blocks. The core transformation seems to involve the blue pixels influencing the red pixels located vertically below them. Specifically, red pixels in a column below the highest blue pixel in that same column are changed to blue. Red pixels above the highest blue pixel or in columns without any blue pixels remain unchanged. White pixels are unaffected.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  - Input: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - Output: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - Size: Variable, up to 30x30.
Colors:
  - White (0): Background color, generally unchanged.
  - Blue (1): Acts as the trigger/agent for the transformation. Remains in the output.
  - Red (2): The target of the transformation. Can change to blue (1).
Objects:
  - Pixels: Individual cells in the grid.
  - Columns: Vertical sets of pixels.
  - Red Shapes: Contiguous areas of red pixels.
  - Blue Triggers: Individual blue pixels or vertical lines of blue pixels.
Relationships:
  - Vertical Alignment: Pixels sharing the same column index.
  - Position: 'Above' or 'Below' within the same column.
Transformation:
  - Action: Changing the color of specific red pixels to blue.
  - Condition: The change occurs only for red pixels that are in the same column as a blue pixel and are located vertically below the *highest* blue pixel in that column.
  - Scope: The transformation is applied independently to each column.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each column of the input grid.
3.  For the current column, find the row index of the topmost blue pixel (color 1), if any exists.
4.  If a topmost blue pixel is found in the current column at row `top_blue_row`:
    *   Iterate through all rows *below* `top_blue_row` in the same column.
    *   If a pixel in this column at a row `r` (where `r > top_blue_row`) has the color red (2) in the input grid, change its color to blue (1) in the output grid.
5.  If no blue pixel exists in the current column, make no changes to that column in the output grid.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
