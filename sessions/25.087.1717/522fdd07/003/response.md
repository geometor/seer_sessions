```python
import numpy as np

"""
Processes objects on a background grid (orange, 7) based on two main steps:

1.  **Conditional 9x9 Fill:**
    *   Identify "single pixels" in the input grid. A single pixel is a non-background pixel where all 8 neighboring positions (including positions outside the grid boundaries, treated as background) are the background color.
    *   If *exactly one* such single pixel exists in the input grid:
        *   Determine a 9x9 square area centered on this single pixel. Clip the area to stay within the grid boundaries.
        *   Fill this 9x9 area in the output grid with the color of the single pixel.

2.  **Noise Removal:**
    *   Identify "noise pixels" in the *original* input grid. A noise pixel is a non-background pixel that has at least one neighbor (including positions outside the grid boundaries, treated as background) that is the background color. This effectively identifies the "outer layer" of any non-background shape.
    *   If the 9x9 fill was performed (due to finding exactly one single pixel), the location of that single pixel itself is *excluded* from the set of noise pixels to be removed.
    *   Set all identified noise pixels (potentially excluding the single trigger pixel) in the output grid back to the background color.

The fill operation modifies an initial copy of the input grid, and the noise removal operation further modifies this potentially filled grid.
