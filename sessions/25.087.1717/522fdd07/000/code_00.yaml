task_description: Process objects on a background grid by removing noise pixels and conditionally adding a filled rectangle based on input features.
background_color: 7 (orange)

objects:
  - type: Contiguous blocks of non-background colors.
  - properties:
      - color: Various (0-6, 8-9)
      - shape: Mostly rectangular/square, can be single pixels.
      - location: Scattered across the grid.

actions:
  - name: Identify Noise Pixels
    input: Input grid
    target: Non-background pixels
    condition: The pixel has at least one neighbor (8-connectivity) that is the background color (7).
    output: A set of coordinates for noise pixels.

  - name: Identify Single-Pixel Objects
    input: Input grid
    target: Non-background objects
    condition: The object consists of exactly one pixel.
    output: A list of single-pixel objects (color and location).

  - name: Conditional Fill
    input: Output grid, list of single-pixel objects
    condition: Exactly one single-pixel object exists in the input.
    parameters:
      - fill_color: Color of the single-pixel object.
      - center_row: Row of the single-pixel object.
      - center_col: Column of the single-pixel object.
      - size: 9x9
    action:
      - Calculate top-left corner: (max(0, center_row - 4), max(0, center_col - 4)).
      - Calculate bounds: Determine the 9x9 area, clipped by grid dimensions.
      - Modify output grid: Fill the calculated area with fill_color.

  - name: Remove Noise
    input: Output grid, set of noise pixel coordinates
    action:
      - For each coordinate in the noise set, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the background color (7).

order_of_operations:
  1. Initialize output grid from input.
  2. Identify single-pixel objects.
  3. Perform Conditional Fill (if applicable) on the output grid.
  4. Identify Noise Pixels based on the *input* grid.
  5. Perform Remove Noise on the output grid.

relationships:
  - The trigger for the Conditional Fill action is the count (must be exactly 1) of single-pixel objects found in the input.
  - The color and center location for the Conditional Fill are determined by the unique single-pixel object.
  - The Remove Noise action uses noise locations identified from the *input* but modifies the *output* grid (which might have already been modified by the Conditional Fill).
