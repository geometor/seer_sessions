Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Background:** All examples use a consistent background color: orange (7).
2.  **Objects:** The inputs contain multiple distinct objects composed of contiguous blocks of non-background colors (green, yellow, magenta, maroon, blue, white, gray, red, azure). These objects are primarily rectangular or square.
3.  **Transformation - Noise Removal:** In all outputs, the objects from the input appear somewhat "shrunk" or "cleaned up". Specifically, the outermost layer of pixels of each object, where those pixels are adjacent (including diagonally) to the orange background, seems to be removed (changed to orange). If an object is very small (like a single pixel or a thin line), it might disappear entirely after this process.
4.  **Transformation - Conditional Fill:** In examples 3 and 4, a large, new rectangle appears in the output grid. In example 3, it's gray (5); in example 4, it's blue (1). This fill does *not* happen in examples 1 and 2.
5.  **Trigger for Fill:** Observing the inputs for examples 3 and 4, we see they each contain exactly one object that is only a single pixel: Gray(5) in example 3 and Blue(1) in example 4. Examples 1 and 2 do not contain any single-pixel objects. This suggests the appearance of the large rectangle is triggered by the presence of a unique single-pixel object in the input.
6.  **Fill Color and Location:** The color of the large filled rectangle in the output matches the color of the unique single-pixel object from the input. The location and size of the filled rectangle appear related to the position of the single-pixel object. Comparing examples 3 and 4, the rectangle seems to be a 9x9 square centered around the location of the input single-pixel object (clipped to the grid boundaries).
7.  **Interaction:** The "noise removal" step happens *after* the potential fill step. Pixels belonging to the original objects' outer layers are removed (turned orange) even if they fall within the area of the new filled rectangle. The remaining "core" pixels of the original objects retain their color and overwrite the filled rectangle where they overlap.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_description: Process objects on a background grid by removing noise pixels and conditionally adding a filled rectangle based on input features.
background_color: 7 (orange)

objects:
  - type: Contiguous blocks of non-background colors.
  - properties:
      - color: Various (0-6, 8-9)
      - shape: Mostly rectangular/square, can be single pixels.
      - location: Scattered across the grid.

actions:
  - name: Identify Noise Pixels
    input: Input grid
    target: Non-background pixels
    condition: The pixel has at least one neighbor (8-connectivity) that is the background color (7).
    output: A set of coordinates for noise pixels.

  - name: Identify Single-Pixel Objects
    input: Input grid
    target: Non-background objects
    condition: The object consists of exactly one pixel.
    output: A list of single-pixel objects (color and location).

  - name: Conditional Fill
    input: Output grid, list of single-pixel objects
    condition: Exactly one single-pixel object exists in the input.
    parameters:
      - fill_color: Color of the single-pixel object.
      - center_row: Row of the single-pixel object.
      - center_col: Column of the single-pixel object.
      - size: 9x9
    action:
      - Calculate top-left corner: (max(0, center_row - 4), max(0, center_col - 4)).
      - Calculate bounds: Determine the 9x9 area, clipped by grid dimensions.
      - Modify output grid: Fill the calculated area with fill_color.

  - name: Remove Noise
    input: Output grid, set of noise pixel coordinates
    action:
      - For each coordinate in the noise set, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the background color (7).

order_of_operations:
  1. Initialize output grid from input.
  2. Identify single-pixel objects.
  3. Perform Conditional Fill (if applicable) on the output grid.
  4. Identify Noise Pixels based on the *input* grid.
  5. Perform Remove Noise on the output grid.

relationships:
  - The trigger for the Conditional Fill action is the count (must be exactly 1) of single-pixel objects found in the input.
  - The color and center location for the Conditional Fill are determined by the unique single-pixel object.
  - The Remove Noise action uses noise locations identified from the *input* but modifies the *output* grid (which might have already been modified by the Conditional Fill).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Start with the output grid being an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Examine the input grid to find all non-background colored objects that consist of only a single pixel.
3.  Check if the number of these single-pixel objects is exactly one.
4.  **If exactly one single-pixel object is found:**
    a.  Note its color (`fill_color`) and its row and column (`center_row`, `center_col`).
    b.  Determine the top-left corner coordinates for a 9x9 square centered (as much as possible) at (`center_row`, `center_col`). Calculate this as `top = max(0, center_row - 4)` and `left = max(0, center_col - 4)`.
    c.  Define the rectangular area in the output grid starting from (`top`, `left`) and extending up to 9 rows down and 9 columns right, but do not go beyond the grid boundaries.
    d.  Fill this entire rectangular area in the output grid with the `fill_color`.
5.  **Identify all "noise" pixels:** Go back to the *original input grid*. For every pixel that is *not* the background color (orange, 7), check its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal). If any neighbor *is* the background color (orange, 7), mark the current pixel's location as a "noise" location. Collect all such noise locations.
6.  **Remove the noise:** For every "noise" location identified in the previous step, change the color of the pixel at that location *in the output grid* to the background color (orange, 7). This overrides any color previously placed there, whether from the initial copy, the conditional fill, or an original object pixel.
7.  The final state of the output grid is the result.
