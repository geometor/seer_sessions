*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids contain shapes made of blue (1) and red (2) pixels on a white (0) background.
    *   The transformation involves selectively changing some blue pixels to red pixels.
    *   Red pixels in the input remain red in the output.
    *   White pixels remain white.
    *   The decision to change a blue object (a contiguous group of blue pixels) to red depends on the object's topology. Specifically, blue objects that enclose one or more white pixels (forming a "hole") are changed entirely to red. Blue objects that do not enclose any white pixels remain blue.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Grid:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 18x18, 15x15)
      - background_color: white (0)
    Objects:
      - type: contiguous shapes of a single color
      - colors: [blue (1), red (2)]
      - identifier: object_id (implicit, based on connectivity)
    Properties:
      - color: the color value of the pixels making up the object (1 or 2)
      - has_hole: boolean property of blue objects, indicating if the object fully encloses one or more white (0) pixels. Red objects are not checked for this property.
    Relationships:
      - object_pixels: set of coordinates belonging to a specific object.
      - enclosed_pixels: set of white pixels whose neighbors (up, down, left, right) are all either part of the same blue object or other enclosed pixels.
    Actions:
      - identify_objects: segment the grid into distinct objects based on color and adjacency.
      - check_for_holes: for each blue object, determine if it encloses any white pixels.
      - conditional_color_change: if a blue object 'has_hole' is true, change the color of all 'object_pixels' for that object from blue (1) to red (2).
    Persistence:
      - Red objects remain unchanged.
      - White background pixels remain unchanged.
      - Blue objects without holes remain unchanged.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
    2.  For each identified blue object:
        a.  Determine if the object completely encloses one or more white (0) pixels. This means finding white pixels such that all adjacent (non-diagonal) pixels are part of the blue object in question.
        b.  If the blue object encloses at least one white pixel (i.e., it has a "hole"), mark this object for transformation.
    3.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
    4.  For every blue object marked for transformation in step 2b, change the color of all pixels belonging to that object from blue (1) to red (2) in the output grid.
    5.  Leave all other pixels (red pixels, white pixels, and blue pixels belonging to objects without holes) unchanged from their input values.
