            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to implement a transformation where non-white pixels in the input define horizontal zones in the output. The core logic correctly identifies these key pixels, sorts them by row, and draws horizontal lines at these rows. It also attempts to draw vertical lines connecting these horizontal segments at the grid's left and right edges.\n\nHowever, the comparison between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` reveals consistent errors across all examples:\n\n1.  **Missing Top Boundary Line:** The expected output always has a solid horizontal line at the very top row (row 0) matching the color of the *highest* non-white pixel in the input. The current code doesn't create this line.\n2.  **Missing Bottom Boundary Line:** Similarly, the expected output always has a solid horizontal line at the very bottom row (last row) matching the color of the *lowest* non-white pixel. The current code doesn't create this line correctly.\n3.  **Incorrect Vertical Line Colors:** The vertical lines connecting two horizontal lines (at rows `R_i` and `R_{i+1}`) should take the color of the *lower* horizontal line (at `R_{i+1}`), not the upper one as implemented in the current code. The vertical lines *above* the topmost pixel's line should take the color of that topmost pixel. The vertical lines *below* the bottommost pixel's line should take the color of that bottommost pixel.\n\nThe strategy is to adjust the natural language program and subsequent code to explicitly handle the top and bottom boundary lines and correct the logic for determining the color of the vertical segments between horizontal lines.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's analyze the input pixels and the structure for each example:\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input Pixels: Red (2) at row 3, Orange (7) at row 7, Azure (8) at row 12.\n- Height: 15, Width: 15\n- Expected Zones (Top to Bottom):\n    - Row 0: Red (Top boundary)\n    - Rows 1-2: Red vertical borders\n    - Row 3: Red horizontal line\n    - Rows 4-6: Orange vertical borders (Color from row 7 line)\n    - Row 7: Orange horizontal line\n    - Rows 8-11: Azure vertical borders (Color from row 12 line)\n    - Row 12: Azure horizontal line\n    - Row 13: Azure vertical borders\n    - Row 14: Azure (Bottom boundary)\n- Code Errors: Missing row 0 (Red), wrong vertical colors (Red instead of Orange, Orange instead of Azure), missing row 14 (Azure), incorrect vertical extent below row 12.\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input Pixels: Azure (8) at row 1, Blue (1) at row 3, Red (2) at row 7, Green (3) at row 9.\n- Height: 15, Width: 15\n- Expected Zones (Top to Bottom):\n    - Row 0: Azure (Top boundary)\n    - Row 1: Azure horizontal line (No vertical segment above as R1=1)\n    - Row 2: Blue vertical borders (Color from row 3 line)\n    - Row 3: Blue horizontal line\n    - Rows 4-6: Red vertical borders (Color from row 7 line)\n    - Row 7: Red horizontal line\n    - Row 8: Green vertical borders (Color from row 9 line)\n    - Row 9: Green horizontal line\n    - Rows 10-13: Green vertical borders\n    - Row 14: Green (Bottom boundary)\n- Code Errors: Missing row 0 (Azure), wrong vertical colors (Azure instead of Blue, Blue instead of Red, Red instead of Green), missing row 14 (Green), incorrect vertical extent below row 9.\n\n**Example 3:**\n- Input Pixels: Green (3) at row 2, Red (2) at row 7, Maroon (9) at row 9.\n- Height: 15, Width: 15\n- Expected Zones (Top to Bottom):\n    - Row 0: Green (Top boundary)\n    - Row 1: Green vertical borders\n    - Row 2: Green horizontal line\n    - Rows 3-6: Red vertical borders (Color from row 7 line)\n    - Row 7: Red horizontal line\n    - Row 8: Maroon vertical borders (Color from row 9 line)\n    - Row 9: Maroon horizontal line\n    - Rows 10-13: Maroon vertical borders\n    - Row 14: Maroon (Bottom boundary)\n- Code Errors: Missing row 0 (Green), wrong vertical colors (Green instead of Red, Red instead of Maroon), missing row 14 (Maroon), incorrect vertical extent below row 9.\n\n**Example 4:**\n- Input Pixels: Magenta (6) at row 2, Red (2) at row 4, Azure (8) at row 11.\n- Height: 15, Width: 15\n- Expected Zones (Top to Bottom):\n    - Row 0: Magenta (Top boundary)\n    - Row 1: Magenta vertical borders\n    - Row 2: Magenta horizontal line\n    - Row 3: Red vertical borders (Color from row 4 line)\n    - Row 4: Red horizontal line\n    - Rows 5-10: Azure vertical borders (Color from row 11 line)\n    - Row 11: Azure horizontal line\n    - Rows 12-13: Azure vertical borders\n    - Row 14: Azure (Bottom boundary)\n- Code Errors: Missing row 0 (Magenta), wrong vertical colors (Magenta instead of Red, Red instead of Azure), missing row 14 (Azure), incorrect vertical extent below row 11.\n\nThe pattern of errors is consistent across all examples, confirming the assessment.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
