            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids are consistently 15x15. They are predominantly white (0), containing a small number of isolated, single, non-white pixels. The position and color of these non-white pixels vary between examples.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are also 15x15. They feature distinct horizontal bands or zones. Each zone is characterized by a specific color, which matches one of the colors found in the input pixels. These zones consist of a solid horizontal line spanning the full width and vertical lines along the left and right edges within that zone. The final row of the grid is always a solid line matching the color of the lowest input pixel.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation maps each non-white input pixel to a colored horizontal zone in the output grid.\n4.  **Color Correspondence:** The color of each zone in the output directly corresponds to the color of an input pixel.\n5.  **Vertical Ordering:** The vertical position (row) of an input pixel determines the vertical position and extent of its corresponding colored zone in the output. The zones appear in the same top-to-bottom order as the input pixels they correspond to.\n6.  **Zone Definition:** A zone associated with an input pixel at row `R` seems to start from the row immediately following the previous input pixel's row (or row 0 for the topmost pixel) and extends down to row `R`. The solid line is drawn at row `R`. The vertical borders (leftmost and rightmost columns) are colored within this zone, excluding the row `R` itself.\n7.  **Boundary Conditions:** The zone for the topmost input pixel starts from row 0. The zone for the bottommost input pixel extends to the bottom of the grid (row 14), and this bottom row is also drawn as a solid line of that pixel's color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Sort these identified pixels based on their row index, from smallest (top) to largest (bottom). If two pixels share the same row, their relative order doesn't matter.\n3.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid (15x15) and initialize all its pixels to white (color 0). Let `H` be the height (15) and `W` be the width (15).\n4.  Keep track of the row index of the *previous* pixel processed, initially set to -1. Let's call this `previous_row`.\n5.  Iterate through the sorted pixels. For each pixel `P` with color `C` and row index `R`:\n    a.  Draw a solid horizontal line of color `C` across the entire width of the output grid at row `R`.\n    b.  Fill the vertical border columns (column 0 and column `W`-1) with color `C` for all rows starting from `previous_row + 1` up to (but not including) row `R`.\n    c.  Update `previous_row` to be `R`.\n6.  After iterating through all the sorted pixels:\n    a.  Identify the color `C_last` and row `R_last` of the *last* pixel processed in the iteration.\n    b.  Fill the vertical border columns (column 0 and column `W`-1) with color `C_last` for all rows starting from `R_last + 1` up to (but not including) the last row (`H`-1).\n    c.  Draw a solid horizontal line of color `C_last` across the entire width of the output grid at the very last row (`H`-1).\n7.  The resulting grid is the final output."
