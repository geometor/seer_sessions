- task_description: "Transform an input grid containing sparse colored pixels into an output grid with horizontal zones defined by those pixels."
- grid_properties:
    - input_dimensions: [15, 15] # Height, Width
    - output_dimensions: [15, 15] # Height, Width
    - background_color: 0 # white
- objects:
    - name: input_pixel
      description: "A single non-white pixel in the input grid."
      properties:
        - color: "Integer value 1-9"
        - row: "Row index (0-14)"
        - column: "Column index (0-14) - Note: column seems irrelevant for the transformation"
    - name: output_zone
      description: "A horizontal region in the output grid associated with an input_pixel."
      properties:
        - color: "Matches the associated input_pixel's color"
        - start_row: "Row index where the zone's vertical borders begin"
        - end_row: "Row index where the zone's solid line is located (inclusive)"
        - solid_line_row: "Row index of the full-width solid line (matches end_row)"
        - vertical_border_columns: [0, 14] # Leftmost and rightmost columns
- relationships:
    - input_pixels_define_output_zones: "Each non-white input pixel defines one output zone."
    - color_preservation: "The color of an output zone is identical to the color of its corresponding input pixel."
    - vertical_ordering: "Output zones are ordered vertically based on the row index of their corresponding input pixels (top to bottom)."
    - zone_extent:
        - description: "A zone for an input pixel at row R_i, following a pixel at R_{i-1}, occupies rows from R_{i-1}+1 to R_i."
        - top_boundary: "For the first pixel (at R_0), the zone starts at row 0."
        - bottom_boundary: "For the last pixel (at R_N), its zone influence extends to the last row (H-1), and the last row becomes a solid line of its color."
- actions:
    - find_input_pixels: "Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid, recording their color and row index."
    - sort_pixels: "Sort the identified pixels based on their row index in ascending order."
    - initialize_output: "Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white)."
    - draw_zones: "Iterate through the sorted pixels to draw the corresponding zones in the output grid."
    - draw_solid_line: "For each zone, draw a full-width horizontal line using the zone's color at the zone's end_row."
    - draw_vertical_borders: "For each zone, color the pixels in the leftmost and rightmost columns between the zone's start_row and end_row-1 using the zone's color."
    - handle_final_zone: "Ensure the vertical borders for the last zone extend to the second-to-last row, and draw a solid line across the last row using the last zone's color."
