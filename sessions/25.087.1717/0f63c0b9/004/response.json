            "text": "The metrics confirm the previous analysis:\n*   **Example 1:** Rows 4, 5 (between R=3(Red) and R=7(Orange)) should be Red(2) but are Orange(7). Rows 8, 9 (between R=7(Orange) and R=12(Azure)) should be Orange(7) but are Azure(8).\n*   **Example 2:** Row 2 (between R=1(Azure) and R=3(Blue)) should be Azure(8) but is Blue(1). Rows 4, 5 (between R=3(Blue) and R=7(Red)) should be Blue(1) but are Red(2). Row 8 (between R=7(Red) and R=9(Green)) should be Red(2) but is Green(3).\n*   **Example 3:** Rows 3, 4 (between R=2(Green) and R=7(Red)) should be Green(3) but are Red(2). Row 8 (between R=7(Red) and R=9(Maroon)) should be Red(2) but is Maroon(9).\n*   **Example 4:** Row 3 (between R=2(Magenta) and R=4(Red)) should be Magenta(6) but is Red(2). Rows 5, 6, 7 (between R=4(Red) and R=11(Azure)) should be Red(2) but are Azure(8).\n\nThe errors consistently occur in the vertical segments (first and last columns) between the horizontal lines drawn at the rows containing input pixels. The expected color for a segment between row `R_i` and `R_{i+1}` is the color associated with `R_i`, while the code used the color associated with `R_{i+1}`.## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code correctly identifies the rows containing non-white pixels in the input grid and draws horizontal lines of the corresponding color across the output grid at these specific rows. It also correctly draws the top and bottom boundary lines using the colors from the uppermost and lowermost identified rows, respectively.\n\nHowever, the code fails because it incorrectly determines the color for the vertical segments in the first and last columns *between* these horizontal lines. The code currently colors the segment between row `R_i` and `R_{i+1}` (where `R_i` and `R_{i+1}` are the rows of consecutive non-white pixels) using the color associated with the *lower* row (`R_{i+1}`). The analysis of the expected outputs reveals that these segments should instead be colored using the color associated with the *upper* row (`R_i`).\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to modify step 8 of the transformation logic: when filling the vertical segments between two consecutive horizontal lines (at rows `R_i` and `R_{i+1}`), the color used should be `C_i` (the color associated with row `R_i`), not `C_{i+1}`.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics gathered using `analyze_diff` confirm the location and nature of the errors across all failed examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:** 8 pixels off. Errors occur in columns 0 and 14 at rows 4, 5, 8, 9. Expected colors [2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7] vs. Actual [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8].\n*   **Example 2:** 8 pixels off. Errors occur in columns 0 and 14 at rows 2, 4, 5, 8. Expected colors [8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2] vs. Actual [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3].\n*   **Example 3:** 6 pixels off. Errors occur in columns 0 and 14 at rows 3, 4, 8. Expected colors [3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2] vs. Actual [2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 9].\n*   **Example 4:** 8 pixels off. Errors occur in columns 0 and 14 at rows 3, 5, 6, 7. Expected colors [6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] vs. Actual [2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8].\n\nThese metrics consistently show that the vertical segment between the horizontal line at `R_i` (color `C_i`) and the line at `R_{i+1}` (color `C_{i+1}`) is incorrectly colored with `C_{i+1}` instead of the expected `C_i`.\n\n## YAML Documentation\n\n"
