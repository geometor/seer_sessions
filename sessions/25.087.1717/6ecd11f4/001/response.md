Transformation Rule:
1. Find the largest contiguous object composed of a single non-white color in the input grid. Let its color be `FilterColor`.
2. Identify all other non-white pixels in the input grid. Find the smallest bounding box that encloses all these pixels. Let this be the `SourceBlock`.
3. Determine the set of `TargetColors` to be filtered out based on the `FilterColor`:
    - If `FilterColor` is green (3), the `TargetColors` are {blue (1), azure (8), maroon (9)}.
    - If `FilterColor` is blue (1), the `TargetColors` are {blue (1), red (2), yellow (4), maroon (9)}.
    - If `FilterColor` is azure (8), the `TargetColors` are {blue (1), green (3), gray (5), orange (7)}.
4. Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the `SourceBlock`.
5. Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `SourceBlock`:
    - Get the color `CurrentColor` at `SourceBlock[r, c]`.
    - Check if `CurrentColor` is present in the set of `TargetColors`.
    - If it is present, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to white (0).
    - If it is not present, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to `CurrentColor`.
6. Return the generated output grid.
