Transformation Rule:
1. Find all contiguous non-white objects in the input grid.
2. Identify the largest object among them (by pixel count). Let its color be `FilterColor` and its coordinates be `LargeObjectCoords`.
3. Identify all other non-white pixels in the input grid that are *not* part of the largest object. Let this set of coordinates be `SourceCoords`.
4. If `SourceCoords` is empty, return an empty grid.
5. Calculate the minimum bounding box that encloses all pixels in `SourceCoords`. Let the top-left corner be (min_r, min_c) and the dimensions be (height, width).
6. Determine the set of `TargetColors` to be filtered out based on the `FilterColor`:
    - If `FilterColor` is green (3), `TargetColors` = {blue (1), azure (8), maroon (9)}.
    - If `FilterColor` is blue (1), `TargetColors` = {blue (1), red (2), yellow (4), maroon (9)}.
    - If `FilterColor` is azure (8), `TargetColors` = {blue (1), green (3), gray (5), orange (7)}.
    - Otherwise, `TargetColors` is an empty set.
7. Create a new output grid with dimensions (height, width), initialized with white (0).
8. Iterate through each coordinate `(r, c)` in `SourceCoords`:
    - Get the color `CurrentColor` from the input grid at `(r, c)`.
    - If `CurrentColor` is *not* in `TargetColors`:
        - Calculate the position in the output grid: `out_r = r - min_r`, `out_c = c - min_c`.
        - Set the output grid cell `output_grid[out_r, out_c]` to `CurrentColor`.
9. Return the generated output grid.
