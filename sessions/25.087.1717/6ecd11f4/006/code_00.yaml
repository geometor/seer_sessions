Task: Filter payload pixels based on the color of the largest object and crop the result.

Examples:
  - Example: 1
    InputShape: [27, 25]
    OutputShape: [3, 3]
    Objects:
      - Type: KeyObject # Largest object
        Color: Green (3)
        Size: 45
        Action: DetermineFilter
      - Type: PayloadPixels # All other non-white pixels
        ColorsPresent: [Blue (1), Red (2), Green (3), Yellow (4), Gray (6), Orange (7), Azure (8), Maroon (9)]
        Action: FilterAndCrop
    Filtering:
      KeyColor: Green (3)
      RemovedColors: [Green (3), Maroon (9)]
      KeptColors: [Blue (1), Red (2), Yellow (4), Gray (6), Orange (7), Azure (8)]
    OutputGrid:
      Source: Kept PayloadPixels
      BoundingBox: Calculated from Kept PayloadPixels coordinates
      Dimensions: [3, 3] # Derived from BoundingBox

  - Example: 2
    InputShape: [27, 21]
    OutputShape: [3, 3]
    Objects:
      - Type: KeyObject # Largest object (tie-broken by position)
        Color: Blue (1)
        Size: 25 # Note: My code picked the central square, actual tie-break might differ but Blue is the key color. Let's assume code finds a Blue(1) object as largest.
        Action: DetermineFilter
      - Type: PayloadPixels # All other non-white pixels
        ColorsPresent: [Blue (1), Red (2), Green (3), Yellow (4), Gray (6), Orange (7), Azure (8), Maroon (9)]
        Action: FilterAndCrop
    Filtering:
      KeyColor: Blue (1)
      RemovedColors: [Blue (1), Red (2), Yellow (4), Maroon (9)]
      KeptColors: [Green (3), Gray (6), Orange (7), Azure (8)]
    OutputGrid:
      Source: Kept PayloadPixels
      BoundingBox: Calculated from Kept PayloadPixels coordinates
      Dimensions: [3, 3] # Derived from BoundingBox

  - Example: 3
    InputShape: [22, 22]
    OutputShape: [4, 4]
    Objects:
      - Type: KeyObject # Largest object
        Color: Azure (8)
        Size: 96
        Action: DetermineFilter
      - Type: PayloadPixels # All other non-white pixels
        ColorsPresent: [Blue (1), Red (2), Green (3), Yellow (4), Gray (5), Gray (6), Orange (7), Azure (8), Maroon (9)]
        Action: FilterAndCrop
    Filtering:
      KeyColor: Azure (8)
      RemovedColors: [Blue (1), Orange (7), Azure (8)]
      KeptColors: [Red (2), Green (3), Yellow (4), Gray (5), Gray (6), Maroon (9)]
    OutputGrid:
      Source: Kept PayloadPixels
      BoundingBox: Calculated from Kept PayloadPixels coordinates
      Dimensions: [4, 4] # Derived from BoundingBox

GeneralProperties:
  - BackgroundColor: White (0)
  - ObjectDefinition: Contiguous pixels of the same non-white color.
  - Connectivity: 4-way (Up, Down, Left, Right).
  - TieBreaking: Largest object determined by pixel count. If ties, implicitly the first object encountered in row-major scan order (or sorted by top-left coord).
