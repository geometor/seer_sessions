This shape varies in form across examples but is always monochromatic.\n    *   The second component is a smaller rectangular block composed of various different colors. This block also varies in size (3x3 in train_1/2, 4x4 in train_3).\n    *   The output grid corresponds in size and content to the smaller multi-colored block from the input, but with some specific colors replaced by white (0).\n    *   The transformation rule appears to involve using the color of the large shape to determine *which* colors within the smaller block should be replaced with white. The specific colors to be replaced depend on the color of the large shape.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
