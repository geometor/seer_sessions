task_description: Count a specific property related to shapes/colors in the input grid and represent the count as a stylized digit using azure (8) on a white (0) background.

examples:
  - id: 1
    input_grid_shape: [25, 25]
    output_grid_shape: [4, 8] # Digit '8' pattern
    analysis:
      - Finds 2 large contiguous non-white objects using 8-connectivity.
      - Both objects contain multiple non-white colors ({1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}).
      - The current code logic (count multi-colored objects) yields a count of 2.
      - The expected output corresponds to a count of 8.
      - Discrepancy: Calculated count (2) != Expected count (8).

  - id: 2
    input_grid_shape: [23, 25]
    output_grid_shape: [3, 7] # Digit '7' pattern
    analysis:
      - Finds 2 large contiguous non-white objects using 8-connectivity.
      - Both objects contain multiple non-white colors ({2, 3, 4, 6}).
      - The current code logic (count multi-colored objects) yields a count of 2.
      - The expected output corresponds to a count of 7.
      - Discrepancy: Calculated count (2) != Expected count (7).

  - id: 3
    input_grid_shape: [22, 22]
    output_grid_shape: [2, 6] # Digit '2' pattern
    analysis:
      - Finds 2 large contiguous non-white objects using 8-connectivity.
      - Both objects contain multiple non-white colors ({2, 3, 4, 7}).
      - The current code logic (count multi-colored objects) yields a count of 2.
      - The expected output corresponds to a count of 2.
      - Match: Calculated count (2) == Expected count (2).

observations:
  - Input grids contain complex patterns with multiple non-white colors.
  - Standard 8-connectivity applied to all non-white pixels identifies exactly 2 large objects in each example.
  - Counting these objects based on whether they contain >1 non-white color consistently results in a count of 2.
  - This counting method only works for Example 3.
  - The correct counts needed are 8, 7, and 2 respectively.
  - The property being counted is not simply the number of contiguous non-white objects, nor the number of objects with >1 non-white color, nor the number of single-color objects, nor the total number of unique colors present.
  - The exact definition of the feature or object type being counted remains unclear based on the provided examples and the failing logic.
  - The output is always a predefined azure (8) on white (0) pattern representing the target count.
