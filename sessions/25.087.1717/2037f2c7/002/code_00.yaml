Input Grid Properties:
  - Contains a background color, white (0).
  - Contains various foreground colors (1-9).
  - Foreground pixels form contiguous shapes or objects.
  - Objects can be composed of a single foreground color or multiple foreground colors.
  - Connectivity between pixels of the same object includes diagonals (8-connectivity).

Output Grid Properties:
  - Contains only white (0) and azure (8) pixels.
  - Forms a visual representation of a single digit (e.g., '2', '7', '8').
  - The size of the output grid depends on the digit being represented.
  - The azure pixels form the shape of the digit against a white background.

Transformation Rule:
  - Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - For each identified object, determine the set of unique non-white colors it contains.
  - An object is considered "multi-colored" if it contains two or more unique non-white colors.
  - Count the total number of multi-colored objects found in the input grid.
  - The output grid is a predefined pixel pattern representing the computed count as a digit, using azure (8) for the digit shape and white (0) for the background.
