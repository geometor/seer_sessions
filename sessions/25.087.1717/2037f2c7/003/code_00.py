"""
Counts the number of distinct, contiguous, multi-colored objects in the
input grid and outputs a stylized representation of that count using
azure (8) on a white (0) background.

Workflow:
1. Find all distinct contiguous non-white objects (connected components) using 8-connectivity.
2. Iterate through each found object.
3. For each object, check if it contains pixels of at least two different non-white colors.
4. Count the number of objects that meet this multi-colored condition.
5. Retrieve the predefined azure/white grid pattern corresponding to this count.
6. Return the retrieved pattern as the output grid.
