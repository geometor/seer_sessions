Error in tool code. The numpy arrays were not defined correctly due to inconsistent row lengths in train_2. Let me fix the arrays.

```
Okay, let's analyze the color counts:
*   **train_1:** Counts: {1: 27, 2: 12, 3: 28, 4: 45, 6: 23, 7: 12}. Max count is Yellow (4) with 45. Output corresponds to N=8. No obvious link.
*   **train_2:** Counts: {2: 42, 3: 54, 4: 64, 6: 26}. Max count is Yellow (4) with 64. Output corresponds to N=7. No obvious link.
*   **train_3:** Counts: {2: 10, 3: 42, 4: 12, 7: 14}. Max count is Green (3) with 42. Output corresponds to N=1 (based on my revised figure count). No obvious link.

This "most frequent color" idea doesn't seem right.

Let's go back to the "core color pair" idea and the figure counting.
1.  **Identify Core Pairs:** How are they determined? Maybe they are pairs that appear *together* within the same object frequently? Or maybe pairs that form a specific shape, like a 2x1 or 1x2 block?
    *   **train_1:** (6,4) and (7,2). Do these pairs appear adjacent often? Yes, in the figures.
    *   **train_2:** (6,4) and (2,4). Appear adjacent in figures.
    *   **train_3:** (7,2). Appear adjacent in the top-left figure.
2.  **Count Figures:** Count contiguous non-white objects containing *at least one* of the identified core pairs.
    *   **train_1:** Pairs (6,4), (7,2). Figures counted = 8. Output grid represents '8'? (4x8 grid size).
    *   **train_2:** Pairs (6,4), (2,4). Figures counted = 7. Output grid represents '7'? (3x7 grid size).
    *   **train_3:** Pair (7,2). Figures counted = 1. Output grid represents '1'? (2x6 grid size).

3.  **Output Generation:** The output is a fixed, potentially stylized representation of the digit N (the count). The color used is azure (8) on a white (0) background. The size of the grid seems related to the digit N, but not consistently (e.g., N=1 gives 2x6, N=7 gives 3x7, N=8 gives 4x8).

Let's define the digit representations seen:
*   N=1 (train_3 output):
    
```
    8 8 8 0 8 8
    0 0 8 0 0 0
    ```

*   N=7 (train_2 output):
    
```
    8 0 0 0 0 0 8
    8 8 0 0 0 8 8
    8 0 0 0 0 0 8
    ```

*   N=8 (train_1 output):
    
```
    0 8 0 0 0 0 8 8
    8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8
    0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8
    ```


These representations seem fixed for each number encountered.

**Refined Hypothesis:**
1.  Scan the input grid to identify all unique pairs of adjacent, non-white, distinct colors. E.g., find all `(c1, c2)` where `c1 != 0`, `c2 != 0`, `c1 != c2`, and `c1` is adjacent (including diagonals) to `c2`.
2.  Determine the "core pairs". How? Perhaps they are the pairs that are part of the largest or most complex objects? Or pairs involving the most frequent non-white color? In train_2, yellow (4) is most frequent, and the core pairs are (6,4) and (2,4). In train_1, yellow (4) is most frequent, core pairs (6,4) and (7,2). In train_3, green (3) is most frequent, core pair (7,2). This doesn't seem consistent.
    *   *Alternative Core Pair Identification:* Maybe the core pairs are simply *all* pairs of adjacent, non-white, distinct colors found anywhere in the grid?
        *   **train_1:** Pairs like (1,4), (4,6), (1,3), (3,4), (1,6), (3,6), (4,2), (2,7), (4,7), (3,7)? Let's test this refinement. An object qualifies if it contains *any* such adjacent distinct pair. This would mean *every* multi-colored object qualifies. Does that change the count?
            *   train_1: Still 8 multi-colored objects. N=8.
            *   train_2: Still 7 multi-colored objects. N=7.
            *   train_3: Still 2 multi-colored objects. N=2.
        *   Okay, if N=2 for train_3, does the output match a '2'?
            *   Output:
                
```
                8 8 8 0 8 8
                0 0 8 0 0 0
                ```

            *   This looks more like a '2' than a '1'. Let's assume this *is* the representation for '2'.

**Final Hypothesis:**
1.  Identify all distinct, contiguous, non-white objects in the input grid.
2.  Filter these objects, keeping only those that contain at least two different colors (i.e., are multi-colored).
3.  Count the number of qualifying objects found in step 2. Let this count be N.
4.  Generate the output grid based on the value of N using predefined, fixed-size, stylized representations for digits 1 through 9 (using azure (8) for dots and white (0) for background). The specific representations are learned from the examples:
    *   '2' (from train_3, N=2): 2x6 grid `[[8,8,8,0,8,8], [0,0,8,0,0,0]]`
    *   '7' (from train_2, N=7): 3x7 grid `[[8,0,0,0,0,0,8], [8,8,0,0,0,8,8], [8,0,0,0,0,0,8]]`
    *   '8' (from train_1, N=8): 4x8 grid `[[0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8], [8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8], [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]]`

This seems consistent across all three examples.

**Double-Checking:**
*   Are there any single-color objects? Yes, in train_1, the single magenta pixel (object 5). This object is correctly excluded by step 2.
*   Does adjacency matter beyond defining contiguous objects? No, just need >1 color within the object.
*   Does the specific shape or color combination matter beyond >1 color? No.

Confidence in this hypothesis is high.

## Perception of Elements:

The input grids contain multiple geometric figures composed of different colored pixels, set against a white background. Some figures are complex and multi-colored, while others might be simpler or monochromatic (though none were solely monochromatic *and* relevant in the examples). The key elements are the distinct, contiguous, multi-colored objects/figures. The transformation focuses on *counting* these specific types of objects. The output is a highly stylized representation of this count, using azure pixels on a white background, with the grid size varying depending on the digit being represented.

## Facts YAML:


```yaml
task_description: Count the number of distinct, contiguous, multi-colored objects in the input grid and output a stylized representation of that count using azure (8) on a white (0) background.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels. Adjacency includes diagonals.
  - multi-colored_object: An object containing pixels of at least two different colors.

input_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - contains multiple distinct objects on a white background.
      - objects can be composed of various colors (1-9).
      - some objects are monochromatic, others are multi-colored.

output_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - contains only white (0) and azure (8) pixels.
      - represents a single digit (the count).
      - uses a specific, stylized pattern for each digit.
      - the size of the grid varies depending on the digit represented.

transformation:
  - action: identify_objects
    input: input grid
    output: list of distinct contiguous non-white objects
  - action: filter_objects
    input: list of objects
    condition: object must contain at least two different colors
    output: list of multi-colored objects
  - action: count_objects
    input: list of multi-colored objects
    output: integer N (the count)
  - action: generate_digit_representation
    input: integer N
    output: output grid
    details: Use a predefined mapping from N to a specific azure/white grid pattern and size. The mapping is learned from examples:
      - N=2 -> 2x6 grid [[8,8,8,0,8,8], [0,0,8,0,0,0]]
      - N=7 -> 3x7 grid [[8,0,0,0,0,0,8], [8,8,0,0,0,8,8], [8,0,0,0,0,0,8]]
      - N=8 -> 4x8 grid [[0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8], [8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8], [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]]
      - (Other digits N would require definition if encountered in test cases).

relationships:
  - The number of multi-colored objects in the input directly determines which digit pattern is generated in the output.
  - The output grid's content and size are solely dependent on this count, not on the specific shapes, colors, or locations of the input objects.
```


## Natural Language Program:

1.  Find all separate groups of connected non-white pixels in the input grid. Consider pixels connected if they touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each such group is an "object".
2.  Examine each object found in step 1. Keep only the objects that are made up of pixels of at least two different colors. Discard objects made of only a single color.
3.  Count how many multi-colored objects were kept in step 2. Let this count be 'N'.
4.  Create the output grid by drawing a specific, predefined pattern that represents the digit N. Use azure pixels (8) for the pattern and white pixels (0) for the background. The size and pattern for each digit N are fixed (as seen in the examples: N=2 gives a 2x6 grid, N=7 gives a 3x7 grid, N=8 gives a 4x8 grid, etc., with their specific azure/white arrangements).
