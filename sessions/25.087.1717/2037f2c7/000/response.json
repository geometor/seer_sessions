No obvious link.\n\nThis \"most frequent color\" idea doesn't seem right.\n\nLet's go back to the \"core color pair\" idea and the figure counting.\n1.  **Identify Core Pairs:** How are they determined? Maybe they are pairs that appear *together* within the same object frequently? Or maybe pairs that form a specific shape, like a 2x1 or 1x2 block?\n    *   **train_1:** (6,4) and (7,2). Do these pairs appear adjacent often? Yes, in the figures.\n    *   **train_2:** (6,4) and (2,4). Appear adjacent in figures.\n    *   **train_3:** (7,2). Appear adjacent in the top-left figure.\n2.  **Count Figures:** Count contiguous non-white objects containing *at least one* of the identified core pairs.\n    *   **train_1:** Pairs (6,4), (7,2). Figures counted = 8. Output grid represents '8'? (4x8 grid size).\n    *   **train_2:** Pairs (6,4), (2,4). Figures counted = 7. Output grid represents '7'? (3x7 grid size).\n    *   **train_3:** Pair (7,2). Figures counted = 1. Output grid represents '1'? (2x6 grid size).\n\n3.  **Output Generation:** The output is a fixed, potentially stylized representation of the digit N (the count). The color used is azure (8) on a white (0) background. The size of the grid seems related to the digit N, but not consistently (e.g., N=1 gives 2x6, N=7 gives 3x7, N=8 gives 4x8).\n\nLet's define the digit representations seen:\n*   N=1 (train_3 output):\n    "

Scan the input grid to identify all unique pairs of adjacent, non-white, distinct colors.

Perhaps they are the pairs that are part of the largest or most complex objects? Or pairs involving the most frequent non-white color? In train_2, yellow (4) is most frequent, and the core pairs are (6,4) and (2,4). In train_1, yellow (4) is most frequent, core pairs (6,4) and (7,2). In train_3, green (3) is most frequent, core pair (7,2).

Identify all distinct, contiguous, non-white objects in the input grid.\n2.  Filter these objects, keeping only those that contain at least two different colors (i.e., are multi-colored).\n3.  Count the number of qualifying objects found in step 2. Let this count be N.\n4.  Generate the output grid based on the value of N using predefined, fixed-size, stylized representations for digits 1 through 9 (using azure (8) for dots and white (0) for background). The specific representations are learned from the examples:\n    *   '2' (from train_3, N=2): 2x6 grid `[[8,8,8,0,8,8], [0,0,8,0,0,0]]`\n    *   '7' (from train_2, N=7): 3x7 grid `[[8,0,0,0,0,0,8], [8,8,0,0,0,8,8], [8,0,0,0,0,0,8]]`\n    *   '8' (from train_1, N=8): 4x8 grid `[[0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8], [8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8], [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]]`\n\nThis seems consistent across all three examples.\n\n**Double-Checking:**\n*   Are there any single-color objects? Yes, in train_1, the single magenta pixel (object 5). This object is correctly excluded by step 2.\n*   Does adjacency matter beyond defining contiguous objects? No, just need >1 color within the object.\n*   Does the specific shape or color combination matter beyond >1 color? No.\n\nConfidence in this hypothesis is high.\n\n## Perception of Elements:\n\nThe input grids contain multiple geometric figures composed of different colored pixels, set against a white background. Some figures are complex and multi-colored, while others might be simpler or monochromatic (though none were solely monochromatic *and* relevant in the examples). The key elements are the distinct, contiguous, multi-colored objects/figures. The transformation focuses on *counting* these specific types of objects. The output is a highly stylized representation of this count, using azure pixels on a white background, with the grid size varying depending on the digit being represented.\n\n## Facts YAML:\n\n"
