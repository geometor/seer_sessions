task_description: "Identify specific core motifs in the input grid, count them, and check for enclosure by blue pixels to determine a final count (either the motif count or 8). Output a predefined azure/white grid representing this final count."

  motif_indicator_colors:
    - 6 (magenta) # Must be adjacent to yellow
    - 7 (orange)  # Must be adjacent to yellow
  enclosing_border_color: 1 (blue)

  description: "An azure (8) and white (0) grid representing the final_count."
