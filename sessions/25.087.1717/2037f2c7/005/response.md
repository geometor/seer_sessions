"""
Identifies distinct contiguous objects composed of any non-white pixels 
using 8-connectivity. Counts how many of these objects contain pixels of 
at least two different non-white colors. Retrieves a predefined azure/white 
grid pattern corresponding to this count (specifically defined for counts 2, 7, 
and 8 based on training outputs). Returns the retrieved pattern.

Note: This logic correctly produces the output for Example 3 (count=2) but 
incorrectly produces a count of 2 for Examples 1 (expected 8) and 2 (expected 7), 
indicating the counting criteria are likely incomplete or incorrect for the 
general task. The fundamental definition of what constitutes the 'item' to be 
counted requires further refinement.
