*   **Perception:** The task involves identifying two specific colored pixels (blue and red) in an input grid and drawing a line between two points derived from their locations. The output grid is the input grid overlaid with this newly drawn line in green.

*   **Grid Properties:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
*   **Pixel Colors:**
    *   Inputs contain a background of white (0), exactly one blue (1) pixel, and exactly one red (2) pixel.
    *   Outputs contain the original white, blue, and red pixels, plus several green (3) pixels forming a line.
*   **Objects:** The primary objects are the single blue pixel and the single red pixel. A new object, a green line, is created in the output.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation is the generation of the green line.
*   **Line Generation:**
    1.  Identify the coordinates of the blue pixel B(rB, cB) and the red pixel R(rR, cR).
    2.  Determine the relative direction vector (dr, dc) pointing from R towards B. `dr` is the sign of (rB - rR) and `dc` is the sign of (cB - cR). Sign function maps positive to +1, negative to -1, and zero to 0.
    3.  Calculate the start point P_A of the line by taking one step from R in the direction (dr, dc): P_A = (rR + dr, cR + dc).
    4.  Calculate the end point P_B of the line by taking one step from B in the *opposite* direction (-dr, -dc): P_B = (rB - dr, cB - dc).
    5.  Draw a line segment connecting P_A and P_B using green (3) pixels. Standard grid line drawing algorithms (like Bresenham's) seem applicable.
*   **Output Construction:** The output grid starts as a copy of the input, and then the pixels identified by the line drawing algorithm are colored green.

*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
    2.  Find the coordinates (rB, cB) of the single blue pixel (color 1) in the input grid.
    3.  Find the coordinates (rR, cR) of the single red pixel (color 2) in the input grid.
    4.  Determine the primary direction vector from the red pixel towards the blue pixel:
        a.  Calculate the row step `dr`: `dr = 1` if rB > rR, `dr = -1` if rB < rR, `dr = 0` if rB == rR.
        b.  Calculate the column step `dc`: `dc = 1` if cB > cR, `dc = -1` if cB < cR, `dc = 0` if cB == cR.
    5.  Calculate the starting coordinate P_A for the green line: P_A = (rR + dr, cR + dc).
    6.  Calculate the ending coordinate P_B for the green line: P_B = (rB - dr, cB - dc).
    7.  Identify all the grid cells (pixels) that lie on the discrete line segment connecting P_A and P_B using Bresenham's line algorithm (or an equivalent grid line drawing algorithm).
    8.  For each cell (r, c) identified in the previous step, set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to green (color 3).
    9.  The final modified grid is the result.
