The output grid is the input grid overlaid with this newly drawn line in green.\n\n*   **Grid Properties:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n*   **Pixel Colors:**\n    *   Inputs contain a background of white (0), exactly one blue (1) pixel, and exactly one red (2) pixel.\n    *   Outputs contain the original white, blue, and red pixels, plus several green (3) pixels forming a line.\n*   **Objects:** The primary objects are the single blue pixel and the single red pixel. A new object, a green line, is created in the output.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation is the generation of the green line.\n*   **Line Generation:**\n    1.  Identify the coordinates of the blue pixel B(rB, cB) and the red pixel R(rR, cR).\n    2.  Determine the relative direction vector (dr, dc) pointing from R towards B. `dr` is the sign of (rB - rR) and `dc` is the sign of (cB - cR). Sign function maps positive to +1, negative to -1, and zero to 0.\n    3.  Calculate the start point P_A of the line by taking one step from R in the direction (dr, dc): P_A = (rR + dr, cR + dc).\n    4.  Calculate the end point P_B of the line by taking one step from B in the *opposite* direction (-dr, -dc): P_B = (rB - dr, cB - dc).\n    5.  Draw a line segment connecting P_A and P_B using green (3) pixels. Standard grid line drawing algorithms (like Bresenham's) seem applicable.\n*   **Output Construction:** The output grid starts as a copy of the input, and then the pixels identified by the line drawing algorithm are colored green.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
