The grid dimensions vary across examples.\n2.  **Background Color:** A dominant background color exists in all examples, which is orange (7). This color fills space and generally remains unchanged unless overwritten or used to fill space left by moving objects.\n3.  **Objects:** The key elements are contiguous blocks (objects) of non-background colors located at or touching the four corners of the input grid. These objects can be single pixels (train_1) or larger rectangles (train_2, train_3, train_4).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves potentially moving some (or all, or none) of these corner objects.\n5.  **Movement:** When an object moves, it shifts exactly one step diagonally inwards towards the center of the grid. The original location of the moved object is filled with the background color (orange).\n6.  **Selection Rule:** Not all corner objects necessarily move. The decision of which objects move depends on the *colors* of all the distinct corner objects present in the input grid and potentially the *dimensions* of the grid.\n    *   If only one distinct non-background color exists across all corner objects, objects of that color move (train_1).\n    *   If two distinct non-background colors exist, the rule depends on grid dimensions: if both dimensions are odd, the objects with the *minimum* color value move (train_4); otherwise (if at least one dimension is even), the objects with the *maximum* color value move (train_3).\n    *   If three distinct non-background colors exist, the objects with the *median* color value (when sorted) move (train_2).\n7.  **Object Integrity:** Moving objects retain their shape and color.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Find all contiguous objects of non-background color that touch any of the four corner pixels (0,0), (0, W-1), (H-1, 0), (H-1, W-1).\n4.  Create a list of the unique colors of these corner objects. Let this list be `C`.\n5.  Count the number of unique colors, `N = length(C)`.\n6.  If `N` is 0, make no changes to the grid.\n7.  If `N` is 1, the target color `T` is the single color in `C`.\n8.  If `N` is 2, sort `C`. If `H` is odd AND `W` is odd, the target color `T` is the first (minimum) color in sorted `C`. Otherwise, the target color `T` is the second (maximum) color in sorted `C`.\n9.  If `N` is 3, sort `C`. The target color `T` is the second (median) color in sorted `C`.\n10. (Assume N will not be 4 or greater based on examples).\n11. Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.\n12. Iterate through the four corners. For each corner, identify the corner object associated with it.\n13. If a corner object's color matches the target color `T`:\n    a.  Determine the movement direction: one step diagonally inwards (e.g., top-left object pixels move from (r, c) to (r+1, c+1), top-right from (r, c) to (r+1, c-1), etc.).\n    b.  For every pixel `(r, c)` belonging to this target object:\n        i.  Calculate its new position `(nr, nc)` after the diagonal inward move.\n        ii. Set the pixel at `(nr, nc)` in the output grid to the target color `T`.\n    c.  After calculating all new positions for the object, iterate through every original pixel `(r, c)` belonging to the object and set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to the background color (orange, 7).\n14.
