task_elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - type: Input/Output
      - background_color: white (0)
      - dimensions: variable (up to 30x30)
  - element: Seed Pixel
    properties:
      - type: Input feature
      - count: Typically 4 per input grid
      - color: Non-white (1-9)
      - role: Center point for output structures
      - grouping: Form two pairs based on row index (top pair, bottom pair)
  - element: 3x3 Square
    properties:
      - type: Output feature
      - count: 4 per output grid (one for each input seed)
      - location: Centered on the corresponding input seed location
      - composition:
        - center_pixel: Color of the corresponding input seed (Color A)
        - surrounding_pixels: Color of the *other* seed in the pair (Color B)
  - element: Grey Pixel Connector
    properties:
      - type: Output feature
      - color: grey (5)
      - role: Connects the generated 3x3 squares
      - placement:
        - horizontal: Between paired squares (same row), at offsets 2 (always) and 4 (if distance >= 7) from centers.
        - vertical: Between corresponding squares from different pairs (same column), at offsets 2 (always) and 4 (if distance >= 7) from centers.
relationships:
  - type: Pairing
    subject: Seed Pixels
    predicate: are grouped into
    object: two pairs (Top Pair, Bottom Pair) based on minimum/maximum row indices.
  - type: Generation
    subject: Seed Pixel Pair ((LocA, ColorA), (LocB, ColorB))
    predicate: generates
    object: two 3x3 Squares (one centered at LocA with center ColorA/surround ColorB, one centered at LocB with center ColorB/surround ColorA).
  - type: Connection (Horizontal)
    subject: Paired 3x3 Squares
    predicate: are connected by
    object: Horizontal Grey Pixel Connectors based on distance.
  - type: Connection (Vertical)
    subject: Vertically Aligned 3x3 Squares (from different pairs)
    predicate: are connected by
    object: Vertical Grey Pixel Connectors based on distance.
