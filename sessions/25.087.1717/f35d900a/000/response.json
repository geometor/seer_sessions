            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** Contains a sparse set of usually four non-white pixels (seeds) on a white background. These seeds appear in two distinct colors.\n2.  **Output Grid:** Shows a transformation where each input seed pixel becomes the center of a 3x3 colored square. Additionally, grey pixels (color 5) form connecting lines between these squares.\n3.  **Seed Pairing:** The input seeds seem to form pairs. Based on the examples, the two seeds with the smallest row index form one pair, and the two seeds with the largest row index form the second pair. Within each pair, the seeds share the same row index.\n4.  **3x3 Square Generation:** For a pair of seeds (SeedA at LocA with ColorA, SeedB at LocB with ColorB):\n    *   A 3x3 square is generated centered at LocA. The center pixel has ColorA, and all 8 surrounding pixels have ColorB.\n    *   A 3x3 square is generated centered at LocB. The center pixel has ColorB, and all 8 surrounding pixels have ColorA.\n5.  **Grey Connectors:** Grey pixels (color 5) connect the generated squares.\n    *   **Horizontal Connectors:** Within each pair (which share the same row), grey pixels are placed on that row between the two generated squares. Specifically, grey pixels are placed 2 columns away (inward) from the center of each square. If the horizontal distance between the centers is 7 or more, additional grey pixels are placed 4 columns away (inward) from each center.\n    *   **Vertical Connectors:** Grey pixels also connect the corresponding squares from the two different pairs. For the two squares generated from the leftmost seeds of each pair (which share the same column), grey pixels are placed in that column between the two squares. Grey pixels are placed 2 rows away (inward) from the center of each square. If the vertical distance between the centers is 7 or more, additional grey pixels are placed 4 rows away (inward) from each center. The same logic applies to the two squares generated from the rightmost seeds of each pair.\n\n## YAML Fact Sheet\n\n"

Identify all non-white pixels (seeds) in the input grid, recording their row, column, and color.\n3.  Sort the seeds based on their row index (ascending), and then by their column index (ascending) for seeds in the same row. This should result in four seeds: S1, S2, S3, S4.\n4.  Group the seeds into two pairs: Pair 1 consists of S1 and S2 (the top pair). Pair 2 consists of S3 and S4 (the bottom pair).\n5.  For each seed S = (row, col, color) in Pair 1 (S1, S2) and its partner P = (p_row, p_col, p_color) within that pair:\n    a.  Draw a 3x3 square centered at (row, col) in the output grid. The center pixel (at row, col) gets the `color`. All 8 surrounding pixels get the `p_color`.\n6.  For each seed S = (row, col, color) in Pair 2 (S3, S4) and its partner P = (p_row, p_col, p_color) within that pair:\n    a.  Draw a 3x3 square centered at (row, col) in the output grid. The center pixel (at row, col) gets the `color`. All 8 surrounding pixels get the `p_color`.\n7.  Draw horizontal grey connectors for Pair 1 (S1 = (r1, c1, _), S2 = (r1, c2, _)):\n    a.  Calculate horizontal distance: `dist_h = abs(c2 - c1)`.\n    b.  Place grey pixels (5) at `(r1, c1 + 2)` and `(r1, c2 - 2)`.\n    c.  If `dist_h >= 7`, also place grey pixels at `(r1, c1 + 4)` and `(r1, c2 - 4)`.\n8.  Draw horizontal grey connectors for Pair 2 (S3 = (r3, c3, _), S4 = (r3, c4, _)):\n    a.  Calculate horizontal distance: `dist_h = abs(c4 - c3)`.\n    b.  Place grey pixels (5) at `(r3, c3 + 2)` and `(r3, c4 - 2)`.\n    c.  If `dist_h >= 7`, also place grey pixels at `(r3, c3 + 4)` and `(r3, c4 - 4)`.\n9.  Draw vertical grey connectors between the left elements (S1=(r1, c1, _), S3=(r3, c1, _)):\n    a.  Calculate vertical distance: `dist_v = abs(r3 - r1)`.\n    b.  Place grey pixels (5) at `(r1 + 2, c1)` and `(r3 - 2, c1)`.\n    c.  If `dist_v >= 7`, also place grey pixels at `(r1 + 4, c1)` and `(r3 - 4, c1)`.\n10. Draw vertical grey connectors between the right elements (S2=(r1, c2, _), S4=(r3, c2, _)):\n    a.  Calculate vertical distance: `dist_v = abs(r3 - r1)`.\n    b.  Place grey pixels (5) at `(r1 + 2, c2)` and `(r3 - 2, c2)`.\n    c.  If `dist_v >= 7`, also place grey pixels at `(r1 + 4, c2)` and `(r3 - 4, c2)`.\n11. Return the completed output grid."
