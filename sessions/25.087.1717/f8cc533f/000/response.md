*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output grids share the same dimensions.
    *   Each grid has a dominant background color (green=3 in train\_1, red=2 in train\_2, yellow=4 in train\_3).
    *   Within the background, there are distinct shapes or patterns made of other colors (azure=8, yellow=4, red=2, blue=1 in train\_1; yellow=4, blue=1 in train\_2; green=3, azure=8, red=2 in train\_3).
    *   The transformation involves changing some background pixels to the color of the adjacent shapes/patterns. Specifically, background pixels that are 'inside' or 'surrounded' by a particular shape's color adopt that color.
    *   The core operation appears to be a form of conditional filling or propagation based on neighboring pixel colors.

*   **YAML Facts:**

              - action: copy_pixel_color
                target: output_grid at current_pixel_position
                parameters: new_color = input_grid pixel color
        actions_if_false:
          - action: copy_pixel_color
            target: output_grid at current_pixel_position
            parameters: new_color = input_grid pixel color
    
    relationships:
      - A background pixel's output color depends on the colors of its 8 immediate neighbors in the input grid.
      - A specific non-background color needs to appear at least 3 times in the neighborhood of a background pixel to cause that pixel to change to that non-background color.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the background color by finding the most frequent color in the input grid.
    2.  Create a new output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
    3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
    4.  For the current pixel, check if its color is the background color.
    5.  If it is the background color:
        a.  Examine its 8 neighboring pixels (including diagonals).
        b.  Count the occurrences of each non-background color among the neighbors.
        c.  Check if any single non-background color appears 3 or more times.
        d.  If such a color exists, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the *output grid* to that non-background color. (If multiple colors meet the condition, this needs clarification, but examples suggest only one will satisfy it per pixel).
        e.  If no non-background color appears 3 or more times, the corresponding pixel in the output grid retains the background color (no change needed from step 2).
    6.  If the current pixel is *not* the background color, its color in the output grid remains unchanged (no change needed from step 2).
    7.  Return the final output grid.
