Transformation Rule:

1.  Identify the background color, which is the most frequent color in the input grid.
2.  Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
4.  If a pixel has the background color:
    a.  Examine its 8 neighbors (including diagonals).
    b.  Count the occurrences of each non-background color among these neighbors.
    c.  If any single non-background color appears 3 or more times, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to that non-background color.
5.  Pixels that are not the background color remain unchanged.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
