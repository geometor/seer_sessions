Input_Objects:
  - Type: Grid
    Properties:
      - Contains pixels of colors: White (0), Blue (1), Red (2), Green (3).
  - Type: Seed Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Red (2)
      - Count: Exactly 1 per input grid.
      - Role: Origin point for the fill action.
  - Type: Barrier Pixels
    Properties:
      - Color: Blue (1) or Green (3)
      - Role: Block the spread of the fill action.
  - Type: Fillable Pixels
    Properties:

      - Role: Can be changed to Red (2) by the fill action if reachable.
  - Type: Boundary
    Properties:
      - Location: Edges of the grid.
      - Role: Block the spread of the fill action.

Output_Objects:
  - Type: Grid
    Properties:
      - Same dimensions as the input grid.
      - Contains the original Barrier Pixels (Blue, Green) and the original Seed Pixel (Red) in their initial locations.
      - Contains some former Fillable Pixels (White) that are now Red (2).
      - Contains remaining Fillable Pixels (White) that were not reached by the fill.

Action:
  - Name: Constrained Flood Fill
  - Start Condition: Begins at the location(s) of the Seed Pixel(s) (Red).
  - Propagation: Spreads orthogonally (up, down, left, right) to adjacent pixels.
  - Constraint - Medium: Can only spread *through* Fillable Pixels (White).
  - Constraint - Blocking: Spread stops upon encountering Barrier Pixels (Blue, Green), already filled pixels, or the Grid Boundary.
  - Effect: Changes the color of all reachable Fillable Pixels (White) to the Seed Pixel color (Red).
