Task: Constrained Flood Fill from Red Pixel

Priors:
  - Objectness: Pixels of the same color form contiguous regions. White (0) areas are distinct from Red (2), Blue (1), and Green (3) areas.
  - Geometry & Topology: The transformation involves connectivity (adjacency) and containment (being blocked by barriers). Grid boundaries also act as barriers.

Input Grid:
  - Contains pixels of colors White (0), Blue (1), Red (2), and Green (3).
  - Contains exactly one Red (2) pixel which acts as the seed/origin for the transformation.
  - Contains Blue (1) and Green (3) pixels which form barriers.
  - Contains White (0) pixels which are the target for filling.

Output Grid:
  - Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Preserves the location and color of the original Red (2), Blue (1), and Green (3) pixels from the input.
  - Some White (0) pixels from the input are changed to Red (2).

Transformation Rule (Action):
  - Identify the location of the initial Red (2) pixel(s).
  - Perform a flood fill starting from these initial Red pixel(s).
  - The fill spreads orthogonally (up, down, left, right) to adjacent pixels.
  - The fill propagates *only* through White (0) pixels.
  - The fill is blocked by Blue (1) pixels, Green (3) pixels, and the grid boundaries.
  - All White (0) pixels reachable by this flood fill are changed to Red (2) in the output grid.
  - Pixels that are not White (0) or are White (0) but not reachable from the initial Red pixel via other White pixels are unchanged.
