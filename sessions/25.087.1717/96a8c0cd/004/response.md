**General Assessment & Strategy**

The previous code failed because it did not correctly identify the pixels to be filled. It used an "outside-in" approach (finding white pixels reachable from the border) rather than an "inside-out" approach (spreading from the initial red pixel). The metrics confirm that in all examples, the input contains exactly one red pixel, and the output contains significantly more red pixels, while the counts of blue and green pixels remain unchanged. The number of white pixels decreases by the same amount that the red pixels increase, confirming that only white pixels are being filled with red. The transformed output from the previous code is identical to the input in terms of pixel values, indicating the filling condition was never met.

The strategy is to implement a flood fill algorithm that starts specifically from the initial red pixel(s) found in the input grid. This fill should propagate through adjacent white pixels (orthogonally) and stop at grid boundaries or any non-white pixels (specifically blue or green, though stopping at any non-white pixel is sufficient and simpler).

**Metrics Analysis**

-   **Grid Shapes:** Input and output shapes are consistent for each example. The failed code also preserved the shape.
-   **Color Counts:**
    -   Inputs consistently have 1 red pixel (color 2).
    -   Outputs have many more red pixels (39, 37, 29, 32).
    -   The number of white pixels (color 0) decreases in the output by exactly the increase in red pixels (`pixels_filled = output_red_count - input_red_count`; `output_white_count = input_white_count - pixels_filled`).
    -   The counts of blue (1) and green (3) pixels are identical between input and output.
    -   The failed transformed output has identical color counts to the input.
-   **Initial Red Location:** Each input has a single starting red pixel.
-   **Pixels Off:** The number of pixels off in the failed transformation corresponds exactly to the number of white pixels that *should* have been filled red (`pixels_off = output_red_count - input_red_count`).

Task: Constrained Flood Fill from Red Pixel

Priors:
  - Objectness: Pixels of the same color form contiguous regions. White (0) areas are distinct from Red (2), Blue (1), and Green (3) areas.
  - Geometry & Topology: The transformation involves connectivity (adjacency) and containment (being blocked by barriers). Grid boundaries also act as barriers.

Input Grid:
  - Contains pixels of colors White (0), Blue (1), Red (2), and Green (3).
  - Contains exactly one Red (2) pixel which acts as the seed/origin for the transformation.
  - Contains Blue (1) and Green (3) pixels which form barriers.
  - Contains White (0) pixels which are the target for filling.

Output Grid:
  - Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Preserves the location and color of the original Red (2), Blue (1), and Green (3) pixels from the input.
  - Some White (0) pixels from the input are changed to Red (2).

Transformation Rule (Action):
  - Identify the location of the initial Red (2) pixel(s).
  - Perform a flood fill starting from these initial Red pixel(s).
  - The fill spreads orthogonally (up, down, left, right) to adjacent pixels.
  - The fill propagates *only* through White (0) pixels.
  - The fill is blocked by Blue (1) pixels, Green (3) pixels, and the grid boundaries.
  - All White (0) pixels reachable by this flood fill are changed to Red (2) in the output grid.
  - Pixels that are not White (0) or are White (0) but not reachable from the initial Red pixel via other White pixels are unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Find the coordinates (row, column) of all Red (2) pixels in the input grid. These are the starting points for the fill.
3.  Initialize a queue for a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or stack for Depth-First Search (DFS) with the coordinates of the initial Red pixel(s).
4.  Initialize a set or boolean grid to keep track of visited coordinates to avoid cycles and redundant processing. Add the initial Red pixel coordinates to the visited set.
5.  While the queue/stack is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue/Pop a coordinate `(r, c)`.
    b.  Examine its four orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right): `(nr, nc)`.
    c.  For each neighbor:
        i.  Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries.
        ii. Check if `(nr, nc)` has already been visited.
        iii. Check if the pixel at `(nr, nc)` in the *input* grid is White (0).
        iv. If the neighbor is within bounds, not visited, and is White (0) in the input:
            1.  Change the color of the pixel at `(nr, nc)` in the *output* grid to Red (2).
            2.  Mark `(nr, nc)` as visited.
            3.  Enqueue/Push `(nr, nc)` to continue the fill from this neighbor.
6.  Return the modified output grid.**General Assessment & Strategy**

The previous code failed because its core logic was incorrect for the task. It attempted to find enclosed white areas by identifying white pixels connected to the border and then filling the *rest* of the white pixels. However, the task requires a direct flood fill *originating* from the specific red pixel(s) present in the input. The fill should spread only through white pixels and be stopped by blue, green, or boundary pixels.

The metrics gathered confirm this:
1.  Each input has exactly one red pixel.
2.  The output shows the red color spreading from this initial pixel.
3.  The spread fills only white pixels.
4.  Blue and green pixels act as barriers and remain unchanged.
5.  The number of incorrect pixels in the failed output exactly matches the number of white pixels that should have been turned red.

The strategy is to implement a standard flood fill (like BFS or DFS) starting from the initial red pixel(s). The fill algorithm will explore adjacent white pixels, changing them to red in the output grid, and stop exploring paths blocked by non-white pixels or grid boundaries.

**Metrics Analysis**

*   **Grid Shapes:** Consistently maintained between input and output.
*   **Color Counts:**
    *   Input Red (2): Always 1.
    *   Output Red (2): Significantly increased (39, 37, 29, 32).
    *   Input White (0): High count.
    *   Output White (0): Decreased count, matching the increase in red pixels.
    *   Input/Output Blue (1) & Green (3): Counts remain identical.
*   **Initial Red Location:** Confirmed a single starting point in each input.
*   **Pixels Off (Previous Code):** The difference between the failed output and the expected output corresponds precisely to the white pixels that needed filling (`output_red_count - input_red_count`).
