    Performs a constrained flood fill. Finds the region containing the initial 
    red pixel (2) that is enclosed by blue (1), green (3), or grid boundaries. 
    Fills all white (0) pixels within this enclosed region with red (2). 
    Other pixels (blue, green, original red) remain unchanged.

    The process involves:
    1. Identifying all white pixels reachable from the grid border (external region).
    2. Identifying all white pixels *not* reachable from the border (internal region).
    3. Changing the color of the internal white pixels to red in the output grid.
