            "text": "**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe previous code failed because it did not correctly identify the pixels to be filled. It used an \"outside-in\" approach (finding white pixels reachable from the border) rather than an \"inside-out\" approach (spreading from the initial red pixel). The metrics confirm that in all examples, the input contains exactly one red pixel, and the output contains significantly more red pixels, while the counts of blue and green pixels remain unchanged. The number of white pixels decreases by the same amount that the red pixels increase, confirming that only white pixels are being filled with red. The transformed output from the previous code is identical to the input in terms of pixel values, indicating the filling condition was never met.\n\nThe strategy is to implement a flood fill algorithm that starts specifically from the initial red pixel(s) found in the input grid. This fill should propagate through adjacent white pixels (orthogonally) and stop at grid boundaries or any non-white pixels (specifically blue or green, though stopping at any non-white pixel is sufficient and simpler).\n\n**Metrics Analysis**\n\n-   **Grid Shapes:** Input and output shapes are consistent for each example. The failed code also preserved the shape.\n-   **Color Counts:**\n    -   Inputs consistently have 1 red pixel (color 2).\n    -   Outputs have many more red pixels (39, 37, 29, 32).\n    -   The number of white pixels (color 0) decreases in the output by exactly the increase in red pixels (`pixels_filled = output_red_count - input_red_count`; `output_white_count = input_white_count - pixels_filled`).\n    -   The counts of blue (1) and green (3) pixels are identical between input and output.\n    -   The failed transformed output has identical color counts to the input.\n-   **Initial Red Location:** Each input has a single starting red pixel.\n-   **Pixels Off:** The number of pixels off in the failed transformation corresponds exactly to the number of white pixels that *should* have been filled red (`pixels_off = output_red_count - input_red_count`).\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Return the modified output grid.**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe previous code failed because its core logic was incorrect for the task. It attempted to find enclosed white areas by identifying white pixels connected to the border and then filling the *rest* of the white pixels. However, the task requires a direct flood fill *originating* from the specific red pixel(s) present in the input. The fill should spread only through white pixels and be stopped by blue, green, or boundary pixels.\n\nThe metrics gathered confirm this:\n1.  Each input has exactly one red pixel.\n2.  The output shows the red color spreading from this initial pixel.\n3.  The spread fills only white pixels.\n4.  Blue and green pixels act as barriers and remain unchanged.\n5.  The number of incorrect pixels in the failed output exactly matches the number of white pixels that should have been turned red.\n\nThe strategy is to implement a standard flood fill (like BFS or DFS) starting from the initial red pixel(s). The fill algorithm will explore adjacent white pixels, changing them to red in the output grid, and stop exploring paths blocked by non-white pixels or grid boundaries.\n\n**Metrics Analysis**\n\n*   **Grid Shapes:** Consistently maintained between input and output.\n*   **Color Counts:**\n    *   Input Red (2): Always 1.\n    *   Output Red (2): Significantly increased (39, 37, 29, 32).\n    *   Input White (0): High count.\n    *   Output White (0): Decreased count, matching the increase in red pixels.\n    *   Input/Output Blue (1) & Green (3): Counts remain identical.\n*   **Initial Red Location:** Confirmed a single starting point in each input.\n*   **Pixels Off (Previous Code):** The difference between the failed output and the expected output corresponds precisely to the white pixels that needed filling (`output_red_count - input_red_count`).\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
