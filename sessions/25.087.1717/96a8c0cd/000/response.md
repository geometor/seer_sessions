Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Composition**: The input grids contain a background of white pixels (0) and several foreground objects made of blue (1), green (3), and a single red (2) pixel.
2.  **Object Types**:
    *   There is always exactly one red pixel (2) in the input.
    *   There are multiple blue (1) and green (3) pixels, often forming lines, rectangles, or other simple shapes. These act like barriers or walls.
    *   The white pixels (0) represent empty space.
3.  **Output Grid Composition**: The output grids are identical to the input grids, except that some white pixels (0) have been changed to red (2).
4.  **Transformation Pattern**: The newly added red pixels appear to originate from the single initial red pixel in the input. They spread outwards into the adjacent white space.
5.  **Fill Behavior**: The spreading of red pixels behaves like a flood fill algorithm:
    *   It starts from the location of the original red pixel.
    *   It propagates only through orthogonally adjacent white pixels (up, down, left, right).
    *   It stops when it encounters any non-white pixel (the original red, blue, or green pixels) or the grid boundaries.
    *   The original blue and green pixels are obstacles and remain unchanged. The original red pixel also remains unchanged.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Flood fill from a single source pixel.

Input_Grid:
  - Properties:
      - Contains pixels of colors: white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3).
      - Grid size varies.
  - Objects:
      - Background: Composed of white pixels (0).
      - Source_Pixel:
          - Color: red (2).
          - Count: Exactly one per grid.
          - Role: Origin point for the fill operation.
      - Barrier_Pixels:
          - Colors: blue (1), green (3).
          - Role: Act as boundaries, stopping the fill. They remain unchanged in the output.
          - Arrangement: Form various shapes or scattered points.

Output_Grid:
  - Derived_From: Input_Grid.
  - Changes:
      - Some white pixels (0) from the input are changed to red (2).
  - Content:
      - Retains all original blue (1), green (3), and the single red (2) pixel from the input in their original positions.
      - Includes new red pixels (2) in addition to the original ones.

Transformation:
  - Type: Flood Fill / Area Filling.
  - Source: The single red pixel (2) in the input grid.
  - Fill_Color: red (2).
  - Fillable_Area: Contiguous white pixels (0) reachable from the source pixel via orthogonal adjacency.
  - Boundaries:
      - Grid edges.
      - Non-white pixels (blue=1, original red=2, green=3) in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the coordinates (row, column) of the single red pixel (color 2) in the input grid. This is the starting point for the fill.
3.  Create a list or queue of locations to visit, initially containing only the starting point coordinates.
4.  Create a set or list to keep track of visited locations to avoid redundant processing and infinite loops. Add the starting point to the visited set.
5.  While the list of locations to visit is not empty:
    a.  Remove a location (current\_row, current\_col) from the list.
    b.  Examine its four orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right): (neighbor\_row, neighbor\_col).
    c.  For each neighbor:
        i.  Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.
        ii. Check if the neighbor has already been visited.
        iii. Check if the neighbor pixel in the *input* grid is white (color 0).
        iv. If all checks pass (within bounds, not visited, is white in input):
            1.  Change the color of the neighbor pixel in the *output* grid to red (2).
            2.  Add the neighbor's coordinates to the list of locations to visit.
            3.  Add the neighbor's coordinates to the visited set.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
