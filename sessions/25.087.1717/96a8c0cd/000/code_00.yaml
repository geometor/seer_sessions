Task: Flood fill from a single source pixel.

Input_Grid:
  - Properties:
      - Contains pixels of colors: white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3).
      - Grid size varies.
  - Objects:
      - Background: Composed of white pixels (0).
      - Source_Pixel:
          - Color: red (2).
          - Count: Exactly one per grid.
          - Role: Origin point for the fill operation.
      - Barrier_Pixels:
          - Colors: blue (1), green (3).
          - Role: Act as boundaries, stopping the fill. They remain unchanged in the output.
          - Arrangement: Form various shapes or scattered points.

Output_Grid:
  - Derived_From: Input_Grid.
  - Changes:
      - Some white pixels (0) from the input are changed to red (2).
  - Content:
      - Retains all original blue (1), green (3), and the single red (2) pixel from the input in their original positions.
      - Includes new red pixels (2) in addition to the original ones.

Transformation:
  - Type: Flood Fill / Area Filling.
  - Source: The single red pixel (2) in the input grid.
  - Fill_Color: red (2).
  - Fillable_Area: Contiguous white pixels (0) reachable from the source pixel via orthogonal adjacency.
  - Boundaries:
      - Grid edges.
      - Non-white pixels (blue=1, original red=2, green=3) in the input grid.
