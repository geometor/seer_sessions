These act like barriers or walls.\n    *   The white pixels (0) represent empty space.\n3.  **Output Grid Composition**: The output grids are identical to the input grids, except that some white pixels (0) have been changed to red (2).\n4.  **Transformation Pattern**: The newly added red pixels appear to originate from the single initial red pixel in the input. They spread outwards into the adjacent white space.\n5.  **Fill Behavior**: The spreading of red pixels behaves like a flood fill algorithm:\n    *   It starts from the location of the original red pixel.\n    *   It propagates only through orthogonally adjacent white pixels (up, down, left, right).\n    *   It stops when it encounters any non-white pixel (the original red, blue, or green pixels) or the grid boundaries.\n    *   The original blue and green pixels are obstacles and remain unchanged. The original red pixel also remains unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
