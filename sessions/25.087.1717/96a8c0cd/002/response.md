Ah, the numpy integer types aren't directly JSON serializable. Let's fix the analysis function to cast counts to standard Python `int`.


``` python
import numpy as np
import json

def analyze_grid(grid_name, grid):
    np_grid = np.array(grid)
    height, width = np_grid.shape
    colors, counts = np.unique(np_grid, return_counts=True)
    color_map = {0: 'white', 1: 'blue', 2: 'red', 3: 'green'}
    # Cast counts to standard Python int
    color_counts = {color_map.get(c, str(c)): int(count) for c, count in zip(colors, counts)}

    red_pixels = np.argwhere(np_grid == 2)
    # Cast coordinates to standard Python int tuple
    red_locations = [tuple(map(int, loc)) for loc in red_pixels]

    blue_pixels = np.argwhere(np_grid == 1)
    blue_locations = [tuple(map(int, loc)) for loc in blue_pixels]

    green_pixels = np.argwhere(np_grid == 3)
    green_locations = [tuple(map(int, loc)) for loc in green_pixels]

    return {
        "grid_name": grid_name,
        "height": int(height), # Cast dimensions too
        "width": int(width),
        "colors_present": [int(c) for c in colors], # Cast colors
        "color_counts": color_counts,
        "red_pixel_locations": red_locations,
        "blue_pixel_locations": blue_locations,
        "green_pixel_locations": green_locations,
    }

## General Assessment

The previous code implemented a simple flood fill starting from the red pixel (2) and expanding into adjacent white pixels (0). This was incorrect because the transformation observed in the examples involves a *constrained* fill. The red color spreads only within a region defined by other colored pixels (blue=1, green=3) and the grid boundaries, filling only the white pixels inside this enclosed area. The previous code failed because it filled *all* reachable white pixels, ignoring the implied containment.

The strategy to resolve this is to:
1.  Identify the boundary elements: Blue pixels (1), Green pixels (3), and the grid edges.
2.  Determine the "inside" region relative to the starting red pixel. An effective way to do this is to perform a flood fill from the outside (starting at white border pixels) and mark all reachable white pixels as "outside".
3.  The "inside" white pixels are those that were *not* marked as "outside".
4.  Fill these "inside" white pixels with red (2).

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   **Consistency:** All examples have exactly one red pixel (2) in the input. All examples use white (0), blue (1), and green (3) as other colors.
*   **Transformation:** The output retains the original blue and green pixels in their exact locations. The single input red pixel also remains red. The change occurs only on *some* of the white (0) pixels, which turn red (2). The number of white pixels converted to red varies.
*   **Boundary Colors:** Blue (1) and Green (3) act as boundaries, stopping the spread of red. They are never overwritten.
*   **Containment:** The number of white pixels filled is significantly less than the total number of white pixels initially present, supporting the "contained region" hypothesis. The red fill appears to occupy the contiguous white area where the initial red pixel resides, bounded by blue, green, or grid edges.

## YAML Fact Documentation


```yaml
task_description: Flood fill within a contained area defined by non-white pixels and grid boundaries.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: variable (height/width between 1 and 30)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - colors: [white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3)] are consistently present in inputs.

objects:
  - object: source_pixel
    color: red (2)
    count: 1 (exactly one in each input)
    location: variable
    role: starting point for the fill operation
  - object: boundary_pixels
    color: [blue (1), green (3)]
    count: variable
    location: variable, often forming shapes or lines
    role: act as barriers to the fill operation; remain unchanged in the output.
  - object: fillable_pixels
    color: white (0)
    count: variable
    location: variable, representing the background or empty space
    role: potential candidates for being filled with red.
  - object: grid_boundary
    role: implicit barrier to the fill operation.

actions:
  - action: identify_boundaries
    input: input_grid
    elements: blue pixels (1), green pixels (3), grid edges
    output: a set of coordinates representing barriers
  - action: identify_external_region
    description: Perform a flood fill starting from all white (0) pixels located on the grid border.
    start_points: white pixels (0) at row 0, row H-1, col 0, col W-1
    fillable_color: white (0)
    barrier_colors: [blue (1), green (3)]
    barrier_elements: grid_boundary
    output: mark all reachable white pixels as 'external' (e.g., with a temporary value)
  - action: fill_internal_region
    input: input_grid, marked external_region
    output: output_grid
    process:
      - Create a copy of the input grid.
      - Iterate through the input grid.
      - If a pixel is white (0) AND it was *not* marked as 'external':
          - Change its color to red (2) in the output grid.
      - Ensure the original red source pixel remains red (2) in the output grid (it might already be handled if it's inside the fill area, but good to confirm).

invariants:
  - The position and color of blue (1) and green (3) pixels remain unchanged.
  - The original red (2) pixel remains red (2).
  - Only white (0) pixels can change color.
  - Pixels outside the grid boundaries are not considered.
  - The grid dimensions remain unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a deep copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the coordinates of all blue (1) and green (3) pixels in the input grid. These, along with the grid boundaries, form the barriers.
3.  Create a temporary grid or set to keep track of "external" white pixels reachable from the grid border.
4.  Initialize a queue for a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from the border. Add all *white* (0) pixels located on the outermost rows and columns (row 0, row H-1, col 0, col W-1) to the queue and mark them as visited/external in the temporary grid/set.
5.  Perform a flood fill (BFS or DFS) using the queue:
    *   Dequeue a coordinate.
    *   Explore its orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
    *   For each neighbor:
        *   If the neighbor is within grid bounds, is white (0) in the *input* grid, is *not* a barrier (blue or green), and has *not* been visited/marked as external yet:
            *   Mark the neighbor as visited/external.
            *   Enqueue the neighbor.
6.  Iterate through every pixel (r, c) of the input grid:
    *   If the input grid pixel at (r, c) is white (0) AND it was *not* marked as visited/external during the border flood fill:
        *   Set the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to red (2).
7.  Ensure the original starting red pixel's location in the output grid is red (2). (This step might be redundant if the starting red pixel is always within the enclosed area, but serves as a safeguard).
8.  Return the modified output grid.
