            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code implemented a simple flood fill starting from the red pixel (2) and expanding into adjacent white pixels (0). This was incorrect because the transformation observed in the examples involves a *constrained* fill. The red color spreads only within a region defined by other colored pixels (blue=1, green=3) and the grid boundaries, filling only the white pixels inside this enclosed area. The previous code failed because it filled *all* reachable white pixels, ignoring the implied containment.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to:\n1.  Identify the boundary elements: Blue pixels (1), Green pixels (3), and the grid edges.\n2.  Determine the \"inside\" region relative to the starting red pixel. An effective way to do this is to perform a flood fill from the outside (starting at white border pixels) and mark all reachable white pixels as \"outside\".\n3.  The \"inside\" white pixels are those that were *not* marked as \"outside\".\n4.  Fill these \"inside\" white pixels with red (2).\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the `code_output`:\n\n| Feature             | Example 1       | Example 2       | Example 3       | Example 4       |\n| :------------------ | :-------------- | :-------------- | :-------------- | :-------------- |\n| Input Dimensions    | 22x12           | 22x12           | 13x19           | 12x22           |\n| Input Colors        | 0, 1, 2, 3      | 0, 1, 2, 3      | 0, 1, 2, 3      | 0, 1, 2, 3      |\n| Input Red Count     | 1               | 1               | 1               | 1               |\n| Input Red Location  | (0, 5)          | (0, 3)          | (3, 0)          | (3, 0)          |\n| Input Blue Count    | 12              | 17              | 3               | 9               |\n| Input Green Count   | 29              | 12              | 9               | 6               |\n| Input White Count   | 222             | 234             | 234             | 248             |\n| Output Dimensions   | 22x12           | 22x12           | 13x19           | 12x22           |\n| Output Colors       | 0, 1, 2, 3      | 0, 1, 2, 3      | 0, 1, 2, 3      | 0, 1, 2, 3      |\n| Output Red Count    | 39              | 37              | 29              | 32              |\n| Output Blue Count   | 12              | 17              | 3               | 9               |\n| Output Green Count  | 29              | 12              | 9               | 6               |\n| Output White Count  | 184             | 198             | 206             | 217             |\n| # White -> Red    | 38 (39-1)       | 36 (37-1)       | 28 (29-1)       | 31 (32-1)       |\n\n**Observations from Metrics:**\n\n*   **Consistency:** All examples have exactly one red pixel (2) in the input. All examples use white (0), blue (1), and green (3) as other colors.\n*   **Transformation:** The output retains the original blue and green pixels in their exact locations. The single input red pixel also remains red. The change occurs only on *some* of the white (0) pixels, which turn red (2). The number of white pixels converted to red varies.\n*   **Boundary Colors:** Blue (1) and Green (3) act as boundaries, stopping the spread of red. They are never overwritten.\n*   **Containment:** The number of white pixels filled is significantly less than the total number of white pixels initially present, supporting the \"contained region\" hypothesis. The red fill appears to occupy the contiguous white area where the initial red pixel resides, bounded by blue, green, or grid edges.\n\n## YAML Fact Documentation\n\n"
