Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Similarity:** The output grid is largely identical to the input grid, with specific modifications. The grid dimensions remain the same (20x20 in the examples).
2.  **Modification Type:** The primary modification involves changing certain pixel values to `0` (white).
3.  **Key Color:** The color `2` (red) seems to play a crucial role. Pixels with this color often resist being changed to white.
4.  **Columnar Focus:** The changes are concentrated within two specific *adjacent* columns in each example.
    *   Example 1: Columns 6 and 7.
    *   Example 2: Columns 8 and 9.
    *   Example 3: Columns 14 and 15.
5.  **Identifying Target Columns:** The pair of affected columns seems to be identified by finding a row (or rows) in the input grid that has `0` (white) pixels in those two adjacent positions.
6.  **Two Transformation Rules:** There appear to be two distinct rules applied based on the content of the row being processed:
    *   **Rule 1 (Special Rows):** If a row *contains* the `0, 0` pattern in the identified target columns, the entire row is transformed. In the output row, only the pixels that were originally `2` (red) retain their value; all other pixels become `0` (white).
    *   **Rule 2 (Normal Rows):** If a row *does not* contain the `0, 0` pattern in the target columns, only the pixels within those two target columns are potentially modified. If a pixel within the target columns has the value `2` (red), it remains unchanged. All other pixels within those two target columns are changed to `0` (white). Pixels outside the target columns remain unchanged.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Modify input grid based on identified column pair and row content.

Identification:
  - Find two adjacent columns (let's call them C and C+1) where at least one row in the input grid has the value 0 (white) at both column C and column C+1.

Objects:
  - Input Grid: A 2D array of integer colors.
  - Output Grid: A 2D array of integer colors, same dimensions as input.
  - Pixels: Individual cells within the grid, having a color value (0-9).
  - Target Columns: The specific pair of adjacent columns (C, C+1) identified above.
  - Special Rows: Rows in the input grid containing the pattern [..., 0, 0, ...] at columns C and C+1.
  - Normal Rows: Rows in the input grid *not* containing the pattern [..., 0, 0, ...] at columns C and C+1.
  - Preserved Color: Color 2 (red).
  - Replacement Color: Color 0 (white).

Relationships:
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid.
  - The transformation logic depends on identifying the Target Columns first.
  - The transformation applied to a specific row depends on whether it is a Special Row or a Normal Row.

Actions:
  - Scanning: Iterate through rows and columns to find the target adjacent columns (C, C+1) marked by a `0, 0` pattern in at least one row.
  - Conditional Row Processing: Apply different rules based on whether a row is Special or Normal.
  - Pixel Preservation (Special Rows): Keep pixels with value 2 (red), change others to 0 (white) across the entire row.
  - Pixel Preservation (Normal Rows): Within columns C and C+1 only, keep pixels with value 2 (red), change others to 0 (white). Pixels outside columns C and C+1 are unchanged.
  - Grid Construction: Assemble the modified rows to form the output grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Target Columns:** Scan the input grid row by row. Find the first occurrence of two adjacent columns (let their indices be `C` and `C+1`) where a row contains the value `0` (white) in both column `C` and column `C+1`. Store these column indices `C` and `C+1`.
2.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a copy of the input grid. This copy will be modified to become the output grid.
3.  **Process Each Row:** Iterate through each row of the copied grid (from index 0 to height-1). Let the current row index be `R`.
4.  **Check Row Type:** Examine the *original input grid* at row `R`, column `C` and column `C+1`.
5.  **Apply Special Row Rule:** If the input grid has `0` at `(R, C)` AND `0` at `(R, C+1)`:
    *   Iterate through each column `col` from 0 to width-1 for the current row `R` in the output grid.
    *   If the value in the *input grid* at `(R, col)` is `2` (red), keep the value `2` in the *output grid* at `(R, col)`.
    *   Otherwise, set the value in the *output grid* at `(R, col)` to `0` (white).
6.  **Apply Normal Row Rule:** If the condition in step 5 is false:
    *   Examine the pixel in the *output grid* at `(R, C)`. If its value is *not* `2` (red), change it to `0` (white).
    *   Examine the pixel in the *output grid* at `(R, C+1)`. If its value is *not* `2` (red), change it to `0` (white).
    *   (Pixels in other columns of this row remain as they were copied from the input).
7.  **Final Output:** After processing all rows, the modified grid is the final output.
