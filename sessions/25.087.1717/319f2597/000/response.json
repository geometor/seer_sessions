            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Similarity:** The output grid is largely identical to the input grid, with specific modifications. The grid dimensions remain the same (20x20 in the examples).\n2.  **Modification Type:** The primary modification involves changing certain pixel values to `0` (white).\n3.  **Key Color:** The color `2` (red) seems to play a crucial role. Pixels with this color often resist being changed to white.\n4.  **Columnar Focus:** The changes are concentrated within two specific *adjacent* columns in each example.\n    *   Example 1: Columns 6 and 7.\n    *   Example 2: Columns 8 and 9.\n    *   Example 3: Columns 14 and 15.\n5.  **Identifying Target Columns:** The pair of affected columns seems to be identified by finding a row (or rows) in the input grid that has `0` (white) pixels in those two adjacent positions.\n6.  **Two Transformation Rules:** There appear to be two distinct rules applied based on the content of the row being processed:\n    *   **Rule 1 (Special Rows):** If a row *contains* the `0, 0` pattern in the identified target columns, the entire row is transformed. In the output row, only the pixels that were originally `2` (red) retain their value; all other pixels become `0` (white).\n    *   **Rule 2 (Normal Rows):** If a row *does not* contain the `0, 0` pattern in the target columns, only the pixels within those two target columns are potentially modified. If a pixel within the target columns has the value `2` (red), it remains unchanged. All other pixels within those two target columns are changed to `0` (white). Pixels outside the target columns remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Find the first occurrence of two adjacent columns (let their indices be `C` and `C+1`) where a row contains the value `0` (white) in both column `C` and column `C+1`. Store these column indices `C` and `C+1`.\n2.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a copy of the input grid. This copy will be modified to become the output grid.\n3.  **Process Each Row:** Iterate through each row of the copied grid (from index 0 to height-1). Let the current row index be `R`.\n4.  **Check Row Type:** Examine the *original input grid* at row `R`, column `C` and column `C+1`.\n5.  **Apply Special Row Rule:** If the input grid has `0` at `(R, C)` AND `0` at `(R, C+1)`:\n    *   Iterate through each column `col` from 0 to width-1 for the current row `R` in the output grid.\n    *   If the value in the *input grid* at `(R, col)` is `2` (red), keep the value `2` in the *output grid* at `(R, col)`.\n    *   Otherwise, set the value in the *output grid* at `(R, col)` to `0` (white).\n6.  **Apply Normal Row Rule:** If the condition in step 5 is false:\n    *   Examine the pixel in the *output grid* at `(R, C)`. If its value is *not* `2` (red), change it to `0` (white).\n    *   Examine the pixel in the *output grid* at `(R, C+1)`. If its value is *not* `2` (red), change it to `0` (white).\n    *   (Pixels in other columns of this row remain as they were copied from the input).\n7.  **Final Output:** After processing all rows, the modified grid is the final output."
