Task: Modify input grid based on identified column pair and row content.

Identification:
  - Find two adjacent columns (let's call them C and C+1) where at least one row in the input grid has the value 0 (white) at both column C and column C+1.

Objects:
  - Input Grid: A 2D array of integer colors.
  - Output Grid: A 2D array of integer colors, same dimensions as input.
  - Pixels: Individual cells within the grid, having a color value (0-9).
  - Target Columns: The specific pair of adjacent columns (C, C+1) identified above.
  - Special Rows: Rows in the input grid containing the pattern [..., 0, 0, ...] at columns C and C+1.
  - Normal Rows: Rows in the input grid *not* containing the pattern [..., 0, 0, ...] at columns C and C+1.
  - Preserved Color: Color 2 (red).
  - Replacement Color: Color 0 (white).

Relationships:
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid.
  - The transformation logic depends on identifying the Target Columns first.
  - The transformation applied to a specific row depends on whether it is a Special Row or a Normal Row.

Actions:
  - Scanning: Iterate through rows and columns to find the target adjacent columns (C, C+1) marked by a `0, 0` pattern in at least one row.
  - Conditional Row Processing: Apply different rules based on whether a row is Special or Normal.
  - Pixel Preservation (Special Rows): Keep pixels with value 2 (red), change others to 0 (white) across the entire row.
  - Pixel Preservation (Normal Rows): Within columns C and C+1 only, keep pixels with value 2 (red), change others to 0 (white). Pixels outside columns C and C+1 are unchanged.
  - Grid Construction: Assemble the modified rows to form the output grid.
