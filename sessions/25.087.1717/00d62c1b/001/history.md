**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Composition:** The input and output grids consist primarily of white (0) and green (3) pixels. The output grids additionally contain yellow (4) pixels.
2.  **Color Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some white (0) pixels in the input grid to yellow (4) pixels in the output grid. Green (3) pixels remain unchanged between input and output.
3.  **Condition for Change:** The transformation targets white pixels that are "enclosed" or "surrounded" by green pixels.
4.  **Definition of Enclosure:** A white pixel (or a connected region of white pixels) is considered enclosed if it cannot reach the boundary/edge of the grid by moving only through adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels. Green pixels act as barriers.
5.  **Mechanism:** This suggests a process similar to flood fill. Identify all white pixels connected to the grid's border. Any white pixel *not* connected to the border via a path of white pixels is considered enclosed by green pixels.
6.  **Output:** Enclosed white pixels are changed to yellow (4). All other pixels (green pixels and non-enclosed white pixels) retain their original color.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Identify regions of white pixels enclosed by green pixels and change their color to yellow.
elements:
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: background / potentially enclosed region
  - type: pixel
    color: green (3)
    role: barrier / enclosing shape
  - type: pixel
    color: yellow (4)
    role: indicates an enclosed white region in the output
properties:
  - white pixels can form contiguous regions.
  - green pixels form boundaries.
  - yellow pixels only appear in the output, replacing specific white pixels from the input.
relationships:
  - adjacency: pixels are connected cardinally (up, down, left, right).
  - enclosure: a white pixel region is enclosed if it is not connected to the grid border via a path of white pixels. Green pixels block such paths.
actions:
  - identify: locate all white pixels.
  - analyze_connectivity: determine which white pixels are connected to the grid border.
  - identify_enclosed: isolate the white pixels that are *not* connected to the border.
  - transform_color: change the color of enclosed white pixels to yellow (4).
  - preserve_color: keep the color of green pixels and non-enclosed white pixels the same.
grid_properties:
  - size: varies between examples.
  - border: the outermost rows and columns of the grid are significant for determining connectivity.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all white (0) pixels located on the border (first/last row or first/last column) of the input grid.
3.  Perform a flood fill (or similar connectivity analysis like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) starting from these border white pixels. This fill should only propagate to adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels. Mark all reachable white pixels as "connected to border".
4.  Iterate through every pixel in the input grid.
5.  If a pixel is white (0) and was *not* marked as "connected to border" during the flood fill process, change its color to yellow (4) in the output grid.
6.  Leave all other pixels (green pixels and white pixels connected to the border) unchanged in the output grid.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
