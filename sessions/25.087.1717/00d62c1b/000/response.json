The output grids additionally contain yellow (4) pixels.\n2.  **Color Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some white (0) pixels in the input grid to yellow (4) pixels in the output grid. Green (3) pixels remain unchanged between input and output.\n3.  **Condition for Change:** The transformation targets white pixels that are \"enclosed\" or \"surrounded\" by green pixels.\n4.  **Definition of Enclosure:** A white pixel (or a connected region of white pixels) is considered enclosed if it cannot reach the boundary/edge of the grid by moving only through adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels. Green pixels act as barriers.\n5.  **Mechanism:** This suggests a process similar to flood fill. Identify all white pixels connected to the grid's border. Any white pixel *not* connected to the border via a path of white pixels is considered enclosed by green pixels.\n6.  **Output:** Enclosed white pixels are changed to yellow (4). All other pixels (green pixels and non-enclosed white pixels) retain their original color.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Perform a flood fill (or similar connectivity analysis like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) starting from these border white pixels.
