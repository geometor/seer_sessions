task_description: Identify regions of white pixels enclosed by green pixels and change their color to yellow.
elements:
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: background / potentially enclosed region
  - type: pixel
    color: green (3)
    role: barrier / enclosing shape
  - type: pixel
    color: yellow (4)
    role: indicates an enclosed white region in the output
properties:
  - white pixels can form contiguous regions.
  - green pixels form boundaries.
  - yellow pixels only appear in the output, replacing specific white pixels from the input.
relationships:
  - adjacency: pixels are connected cardinally (up, down, left, right).
  - enclosure: a white pixel region is enclosed if it is not connected to the grid border via a path of white pixels. Green pixels block such paths.
actions:
  - identify: locate all white pixels.
  - analyze_connectivity: determine which white pixels are connected to the grid border.
  - identify_enclosed: isolate the white pixels that are *not* connected to the border.
  - transform_color: change the color of enclosed white pixels to yellow (4).
  - preserve_color: keep the color of green pixels and non-enclosed white pixels the same.
grid_properties:
  - size: varies between examples.
  - border: the outermost rows and columns of the grid are significant for determining connectivity.
