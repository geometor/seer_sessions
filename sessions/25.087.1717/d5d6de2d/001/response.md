"""
Identifies hollow red shapes (color 2) in the input grid. 
Fills the area enclosed by these hollow shapes with green (color 3) in the output grid.
All red shapes (both hollow and solid) are removed, leaving either the green fill or the original white background (color 0).

The process involves:
1. Creating an output grid initialized to white (0).
2. Identifying all 'external' white pixels in the input grid by performing a flood fill starting from the border white pixels.
3. Iterating through the input grid. Any white pixel that was *not* reached by the border flood fill is considered 'internal' or enclosed.
4. Setting the corresponding pixel in the output grid to green (3) for these internal white pixels.
