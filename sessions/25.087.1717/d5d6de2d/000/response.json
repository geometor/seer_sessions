Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).\n    2.  Identify all white pixels (0) in the *input* grid that are on the border (top/bottom row, first/last column).\n    3.  Starting from these border white pixels, perform a flood fill (or similar connected components search) on the *input* grid, marking all reachable white pixels as \"external\". Only travel through white pixels during this search.\n    4.  Iterate through every pixel (row `r`, column `c`) in the *input* grid.\n    5.  If the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the *input* grid is white (0) and has *not* been marked as \"external\" during the flood fill, it means this pixel is part of an area enclosed by red pixels.\n    6.  Set the corresponding pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the *output* grid to green (3).\n    7.  Return the final output grid. (Note: This process implicitly handles the removal of red shapes as the output grid starts white and only enclosed areas are turned green)."
