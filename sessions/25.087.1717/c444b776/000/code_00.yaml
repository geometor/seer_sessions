Task: Reflect patterns across yellow lines.

Input_Grid:
  - Contains pixels of various colors (0-9).
  - Features one or more lines composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels.
    - These lines can be horizontal or vertical.
    - They act as separators or axes.

Output_Grid:
  - Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Preserves the yellow lines from the input grid.
  - Fills regions separated by the yellow lines based on reflection.

Transformation:
  - Identify complete horizontal yellow lines.
  - Identify complete vertical yellow lines.
  - These lines define axes of reflection and divide the grid into regions (2 or 4).
  - Identify the "source" region:
    - If only a horizontal line exists, the source is the region above it.
    - If only a vertical line exists, the source is the region to the left of it.
    - If both exist, the source is the top-left region.
  - Copy the pattern from the source region (excluding the yellow lines themselves).
  - Reflect this pattern across the identified yellow line(s) into the other region(s).
    - Horizontal line: Reflect vertically.
    - Vertical line: Reflect horizontally.
    - Both lines: Reflect horizontally, vertically, and diagonally (or combination of horizontal and vertical reflections).
  - The original source pattern and the yellow lines remain in the output.
