Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.

**General Assessment**

The previous code attempted to implement reflection/copying based on yellow lines. The results show it failed on both provided examples, indicating the transformation logic was not accurately captured.

*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code performed a *vertical flip* copy across the horizontal yellow line, whereas the expected output shows a *direct* copy (no flip) of the region above the line to the region below it.
*   **Example 2 Failure:** The reported transformed output for Example 2 was significantly different from the expected output. However, a detailed trace of the *code's intended logic* for horizontal reflection (`output[r, vc + (vc - c)] = input[r, c]`) perfectly matches the *expected output* for Example 2. This suggests either the `Transformed Output` reported in the prompt was generated incorrectly or there was a subtle bug preventing the intended reflection logic from executing as written in the failed run. Assuming the code's reflection formula is correct for the vertical line case, the primary error was in the horizontal line case (direct copy vs. flip copy).

**Strategy:**

1.  Correct the logic for the horizontal line case: Change the operation from a flip-copy to a direct copy.
2.  Re-affirm the logic for the vertical line case: The horizontal reflection logic (`output[r, vc + (vc - c)] = input[r, c]`) seems correct based on Example 2's *expected* output.
3.  Maintain the precedence: Check and apply the vertical line rule first.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Let's gather specific details about the examples using code execution.
