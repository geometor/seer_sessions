task_description: Identify horizontal or vertical yellow lines and perform a transformation (copy or reflection) based on the line type and the location of non-background, non-yellow pattern pixels relative to the line.
inputs:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
outputs:
  - name: transformed_grid
    type: 2D array of integers (0-9)

objects:
  - object: yellow_line
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - orientation: horizontal or vertical
      - completeness: spans the entire width or height of the grid
      - role: acts as an axis or boundary for transformation
  - object: pattern_pixel
    properties:
      - color: any color except white (0) or yellow (4)
      - location: position (row, col) within the grid
      - role: defines the source region for the transformation
  - object: background_pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - role: empty space, generally ignored unless part of a transformed region

transformations:
  - name: reflection
    conditions:
      - A vertical yellow line exists.
      - All pattern pixels are located entirely on one side (left or right) of the vertical line.
    action:
      - The entire region (all rows) on the side containing the pattern pixels is reflected horizontally across the vertical yellow line onto the other side.
      - Source pixels at `(r, c)` map to destination pixels based on the vertical line column `vc`:
          - If pattern is left (`c < vc`), map to `(r, vc + (vc - c))`.
          - If pattern is right (`c > vc`), map to `(r, vc - (c - vc))`.
    priority: Higher than horizontal copy.
  - name: copy
    conditions:
      - No vertical yellow line exists OR the conditions for vertical reflection are not met.
      - A horizontal yellow line exists.
      - All pattern pixels are located entirely on one side (above or below) of the horizontal line.
    action:
      - The entire region (all columns) on the side containing the pattern pixels is copied vertically (without reflection) across the horizontal yellow line onto the other side, adjacent to the line.
      - Source pixels at `(r, c)` map to destination pixels based on the horizontal line row `hr`:
          - If pattern is above (`r < hr`), map to `(hr + 1 + r, c)`.
          - If pattern is below (`r > hr`), map to `(hr - 1 - (r - (hr + 1)), c) = (hr - (r-hr), c)`.
    priority: Lower than vertical reflection.
  - name: no_transformation
    conditions:
      - No yellow line exists.
      - Yellow line(s) exist, but pattern pixels do not meet the location criteria (e.g., pattern pixels are on both sides of the line, or no pattern pixels exist).
    action:
      - The output grid is identical to the input grid.

validation_criteria:
  - The transformed grid must match the expected output grid exactly in dimensions, pixel values, and pixel locations.
