The failure occurred because the initial logic, derived only from Example 1, did not account for the interaction when both horizontal and vertical yellow lines are present, nor did it correctly interpret the transformation rule in that scenario (reflection vs. copy, and the scope of the transformation). Example 2 introduced a vertical yellow line and showed a reflection behavior, whereas Example 1 involved only a horizontal line and a copy behavior. The previous code incorrectly applied a reflection to the whole left side in Example 2, including the empty top-left quadrant, leading to errors.\n\n## Strategy for Resolution\n\n1.  **Analyze both examples:** Compare the structures (presence/absence of horizontal/vertical yellow lines) and the pattern locations relative to these lines in both examples.\n2.  **Identify the conditional logic:** Determine how the presence and orientation of the yellow line(s) and the location of the pattern pixels dictate the type of transformation (copy or reflection) and the area affected.\n3.  **Prioritize rules:** Establish if one type of line (vertical) takes precedence over the other (horizontal) when both are present, as suggested by comparing the two examples.\n4.  **Refine the transformation mechanism:** Clarify whether the transformation applies to specific quadrants or entire regions defined by the line.\n5.  **Update the Natural Language Program:** Formulate a clear rule that covers both observed scenarios.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\n"
