objects:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer value 0-9.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
      - type: Can be background (0), part of a pattern (non-zero, non-yellow), or part of a reflection line (yellow=4).
  - object: line
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - orientation: horizontal or vertical
      - function: Acts as an axis of symmetry/reflection boundary.
      - index: Row index (for horizontal) or column index (for vertical).
  - object: pattern
    description: A collection of non-background, non-yellow pixels considered as a single entity for transformation.
    properties:
      - location: Its position relative to any identified yellow lines (e.g., entirely above hr, entirely left of vc).

actions:
  - action: find_lines
    description: Identify the row index (hr) of any horizontal yellow line and the column index (vc) of any vertical yellow line.
  - action: locate_pattern
    description: Determine the spatial relationship between all non-background, non-yellow pixels and the identified lines (hr, vc).
  - action: check_conditions_and_transform
    description: Apply transformation based on pattern location and line presence, with specific precedence.
    sub_actions:
      - condition: If a vertical line `vc` exists AND the pattern is entirely to the left (`c < vc`).
        result: Perform horizontal reflection. For each pattern pixel `(r, c)`, copy its color to `(r, vc + (vc - c))`.
      - condition: Else if a horizontal line `hr` exists AND the pattern is entirely above (`r < hr`).
        result: Perform vertical flip-copy. Copy the entire block of rows above the line (0 to `hr-1`), flip it vertically, and place it below the line (starting at row `hr+1`). Specifically, `output[hr + i, c] = input[hr - i, c]` for `1 <= i <= hr`.
      - condition: Else (neither of the above conditions met).
        result: No transformation occurs; output is a copy of the input.
