The metrics confirm the refined hypothesis:
*   Example 1: Has horizontal line (`hr=9`), no vertical line. All non-background/non-yellow pixels are *above* the horizontal line. Action: Vertical flip-copy.
*   Example 2: Has both horizontal (`hr=9`) and vertical (`vc=9`) lines. Not all pixels are above `hr`. All pixels *are* left of `vc`. Action: Horizontal reflection.

The precedence rule seems correct: Check for vertical line condition first, then horizontal line condition.

**Final Logic Formulation:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid for the output.
2.  Find the row index (`hr`) of a horizontal yellow line, if any.
3.  Find the column index (`vc`) of a vertical yellow line, if any.
4.  Identify all non-background (not 0) and non-yellow (not 4) pixels.
5.  **Check Vertical Line Condition:**
    *   If a vertical line `vc` exists AND all non-background/non-yellow pixels have column index `c < vc`:
        *   Reflect horizontally: For each pixel `(r, c)` in the input where `c < vc` and the pixel is not background/yellow, set `Output[r, vc + (vc - c)] = Input[r, c]`. (Ensure the reflected column is within bounds). Stop processing.
6.  **Check Horizontal Line Condition (if vertical condition not met):**
    *   If a horizontal line `hr` exists AND all non-background/non-yellow pixels have row index `r < hr`:
        *   Perform vertical flip-copy: For `1 <= i <= hr`, for all columns `c`, set `Output[hr + i, c] = Input[hr - i, c]`. (Ensure the reflected row `hr+i` is within bounds). Stop processing.
7.  If neither condition is met, the output remains the initial copy of the input.
8.  Return the output grid.

This covers both examples correctly. The vertical flip-copy is a specific type of reflection not captured by the standard point reflection formula used previously for vertical reflection.## General Assessment

The initial code correctly identified the presence of horizontal and vertical yellow lines, interpreting them as axes of symmetry. However, it failed because:
1.  **Incorrect Reflection Type (Example 1):** For the horizontal line case, the code performed a standard point-by-point reflection (`output[hr + (hr - r)] = input[r]`). The actual transformation required copying the entire region above the line, flipping it vertically, and placing it below the line (`output[hr + i] = input[hr - i]`).
2.  **Incorrect Prioritization/Logic (Example 2):** When both lines were present, the code assumed a combined reflection originating from the top-left quadrant. The example showed that only a horizontal reflection across the vertical line was performed, and the presence of the horizontal line was irrelevant *for the transformation itself* in that case. The input pattern's position relative to the lines determines the transformation.

The strategy is to refine the transformation logic based on the *location* of the non-background (and non-yellow) pattern relative to the yellow lines, implementing the correct reflection/copy mechanism for each case, and establishing a clear precedence if multiple conditions could potentially apply.

## Metrics

Based on code execution analysis:

**Example 1:**
*   Input Shape: (19, 9)
*   Horizontal Yellow Line: Found at row index 9 (`hr = 9`).
*   Vertical Yellow Line: None (`vc = None`).
*   Non-Background/Non-Yellow Pixels: 10 pixels found.
*   Pattern Position: All non-background/non-yellow pixels are located *above* the horizontal line (`r < 9`).
*   Applicable Rule: Horizontal line exists, pattern is fully above it. Expected action: Vertical flip-copy.

**Example 2:**
*   Input Shape: (19, 19)
*   Horizontal Yellow Line: Found at row index 9 (`hr = 9`).
*   Vertical Yellow Line: Found at column index 9 (`vc = 9`).
*   Non-Background/Non-Yellow Pixels: 10 pixels found.
*   Pattern Position: Pixels exist both above and below the horizontal line (`r < 9` and `r > 9`). All non-background/non-yellow pixels are located *left* of the vertical line (`c < 9`).
*   Applicable Rule: Vertical line exists, pattern is fully to its left. Expected action: Horizontal reflection.

## YAML Facts


```yaml

    description: A collection of non-background, non-yellow pixels considered as a single entity for transformation.
    properties:
      - location: Its position relative to any identified yellow lines (e.g., entirely above hr, entirely left of vc).

  - action: check_conditions_and_transform
    description: Apply transformation based on pattern location and line presence, with specific precedence.
    sub_actions:
      - condition: If a vertical line `vc` exists AND the pattern is entirely to the left (`c < vc`).
        result: Perform horizontal reflection. For each pattern pixel `(r, c)`, copy its color to `(r, vc + (vc - c))`.
      - condition: Else if a horizontal line `hr` exists AND the pattern is entirely above (`r < hr`).
        result: Perform vertical flip-copy. Copy the entire block of rows above the line (0 to `hr-1`), flip it vertically, and place it below the line (starting at row `hr+1`). Specifically, `output[hr + i, c] = input[hr - i, c]` for `1 <= i <= hr`.
      - condition: Else (neither of the above conditions met).
        result: No transformation occurs; output is a copy of the input.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find the row index (`hr`) of any solid horizontal line of yellow pixels (color 4) and the column index (`vc`) of any solid vertical line of yellow pixels.
3.  Identify the locations `(r, c)` of all pixels that are not background (color 0) and not yellow (color 4). Call this set the 'pattern pixels'.
4.  Check if a vertical yellow line `vc` was found AND if *all* pattern pixels have a column index `c` less than `vc`.
    *   If both are true: Perform a horizontal reflection across the vertical line. For every pixel `(r, c)` in the input grid where `c < vc`, copy its color to the corresponding pixel `(r', c')` in the output grid where `r' = r` and `c' = vc + (vc - c)`, provided `c'` is within the grid bounds. Then, proceed to step 7 (finish).
5.  If the condition in step 4 was false, check if a horizontal yellow line `hr` was found AND if *all* pattern pixels have a row index `r` less than `hr`.
    *   If both are true: Perform a vertical flip-and-copy across the horizontal line. For each row `i` from 1 up to `hr` (inclusive), and for each column `c`, copy the color from the input pixel `(hr - i, c)` to the output pixel `(hr + i, c)`, provided `hr + i` is within the grid bounds. Then, proceed to step 7 (finish).
6.  If neither the condition in step 4 nor the condition in step 5 was met, make no changes to the output grid (which is currently a copy of the input).
7.  Return the final output grid.
