            "text": "The metrics confirm the refined hypothesis:\n*   Example 1: Has horizontal line (`hr=9`), no vertical line. All non-background/non-yellow pixels are *above* the horizontal line. Action: Vertical flip-copy.\n*   Example 2: Has both horizontal (`hr=9`) and vertical (`vc=9`) lines. Not all pixels are above `hr`. All pixels *are* left of `vc`. Action: Horizontal reflection.\n\nThe precedence rule seems correct: Check for vertical line condition first, then horizontal line condition.\n\n**Final Logic Formulation:**\n\n1.  Create a copy of the input grid for the output.\n2.  Find the row index (`hr`) of a horizontal yellow line, if any.\n3.  Find the column index (`vc`) of a vertical yellow line, if any.\n4.  Identify all non-background (not 0) and non-yellow (not 4) pixels.\n5.  **Check Vertical Line Condition:**\n    *   If a vertical line `vc` exists AND all non-background/non-yellow pixels have column index `c < vc`:\n        *   Reflect horizontally: For each pixel `(r, c)` in the input where `c < vc` and the pixel is not background/yellow, set `Output[r, vc + (vc - c)] = Input[r, c]`. (Ensure the reflected column is within bounds). Stop processing.\n6.  **Check Horizontal Line Condition (if vertical condition not met):**\n    *   If a horizontal line `hr` exists AND all non-background/non-yellow pixels have row index `r < hr`:\n        *   Perform vertical flip-copy: For `1 <= i <= hr`, for all columns `c`, set `Output[hr + i, c] = Input[hr - i, c]`. (Ensure the reflected row `hr+i` is within bounds). Stop processing.\n7.  If neither condition is met, the output remains the initial copy of the input.\n8.  Return the output grid.\n\nThis covers both examples correctly. The vertical flip-copy is a specific type of reflection not captured by the standard point reflection formula used previously for vertical reflection.## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the presence of horizontal and vertical yellow lines, interpreting them as axes of symmetry. However, it failed because:\n1.  **Incorrect Reflection Type (Example 1):** For the horizontal line case, the code performed a standard point-by-point reflection (`output[hr + (hr - r)] = input[r]`). The actual transformation required copying the entire region above the line, flipping it vertically, and placing it below the line (`output[hr + i] = input[hr - i]`).\n2.  **Incorrect Prioritization/Logic (Example 2):** When both lines were present, the code assumed a combined reflection originating from the top-left quadrant. The example showed that only a horizontal reflection across the vertical line was performed, and the presence of the horizontal line was irrelevant *for the transformation itself* in that case. The input pattern's position relative to the lines determines the transformation.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the transformation logic based on the *location* of the non-background (and non-yellow) pattern relative to the yellow lines, implementing the correct reflection/copy mechanism for each case, and establishing a clear precedence if multiple conditions could potentially apply.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on code execution analysis:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Shape: (19, 9)\n*   Horizontal Yellow Line: Found at row index 9 (`hr = 9`).\n*   Vertical Yellow Line: None (`vc = None`).\n*   Non-Background/Non-Yellow Pixels: 10 pixels found.\n*   Pattern Position: All non-background/non-yellow pixels are located *above* the horizontal line (`r < 9`).\n*   Applicable Rule: Horizontal line exists, pattern is fully above it. Expected action: Vertical flip-copy.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Shape: (19, 19)\n*   Horizontal Yellow Line: Found at row index 9 (`hr = 9`).\n*   Vertical Yellow Line: Found at column index 9 (`vc = 9`).\n*   Non-Background/Non-Yellow Pixels: 10 pixels found.\n*   Pattern Position: Pixels exist both above and below the horizontal line (`r < 9` and `r > 9`). All non-background/non-yellow pixels are located *left* of the vertical line (`c < 9`).\n*   Applicable Rule: Vertical line exists, pattern is fully to its left. Expected action: Horizontal reflection.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
