"""
Identifies a single horizontal (hr) or vertical (vc) line composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels. 
These lines act as boundaries for copying or reflection based on the location of non-background (0), non-yellow (4) 'pattern' pixels.
Precedence is given to the vertical line condition.

1. Vertical Line Condition:
   - If a vertical yellow line `vc` exists AND all pattern pixels are to its left (column < vc):
     Reflect the portion of the grid left of `vc` horizontally across `vc`.
     The reflection maps a pixel at `(r, c)` to `(r, vc + (vc - c))`.
     Copy `input_grid[r, c]` to `output_grid[r, vc + (vc - c)]` for `0 <= c < vc`.

2. Horizontal Line Condition:
   - Else if a horizontal yellow line `hr` exists AND all pattern pixels are above it (row < hr):
     Perform a direct vertical copy (no flip). Copy the region above `hr` (rows 0 to `hr-1`) 
     to the region below `hr` starting at row `hr+1`.
     The copy maps a pixel at `(r, c)` to `(hr + 1 + r, c)`.
     Copy `input_grid[r, c]` to `output_grid[hr + 1 + r, c]` for `0 <= r < hr`.

3. No Applicable Condition:
   - If neither condition is met, the grid remains unchanged.

The yellow lines themselves and the original source pattern(s) are preserved.

The metrics confirm the analysis:
*   Example 1: `hr=9`, `vc=None`, patterns all above (`r < 9`).
*   Example 2: `hr=9`, `vc=9`, patterns all below (`r > 9`) and all left (`c < 9`).

The refined hypothesis holds for both cases based on these confirmed metrics.## General Assessment

The initial code successfully solved Example 1 but failed on Example 2. The failure occurred because the initial logic, derived only from Example 1, did not account for the interaction when both horizontal and vertical yellow lines are present, nor did it correctly interpret the transformation rule in that scenario (reflection vs. copy, and the scope of the transformation). Example 2 introduced a vertical yellow line and showed a reflection behavior, whereas Example 1 involved only a horizontal line and a copy behavior. The previous code incorrectly applied a reflection to the whole left side in Example 2, including the empty top-left quadrant, leading to errors.

## Strategy for Resolution

1.  **Analyze both examples:** Compare the structures (presence/absence of horizontal/vertical yellow lines) and the pattern locations relative to these lines in both examples.
2.  **Identify the conditional logic:** Determine how the presence and orientation of the yellow line(s) and the location of the pattern pixels dictate the type of transformation (copy or reflection) and the area affected.
3.  **Prioritize rules:** Establish if one type of line (vertical) takes precedence over the other (horizontal) when both are present, as suggested by comparing the two examples.
4.  **Refine the transformation mechanism:** Clarify whether the transformation applies to specific quadrants or entire regions defined by the line.
5.  **Update the Natural Language Program:** Formulate a clear rule that covers both observed scenarios.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
task_description: Identify horizontal or vertical yellow lines and perform a transformation (copy or reflection) based on the line type and the location of non-background, non-yellow pattern pixels relative to the line.
inputs:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
outputs:
  - name: transformed_grid
    type: 2D array of integers (0-9)

objects:
  - object: yellow_line
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - orientation: horizontal or vertical
      - completeness: spans the entire width or height of the grid
      - role: acts as an axis or boundary for transformation
  - object: pattern_pixel
    properties:
      - color: any color except white (0) or yellow (4)
      - location: position (row, col) within the grid
      - role: defines the source region for the transformation
  - object: background_pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - role: empty space, generally ignored unless part of a transformed region

transformations:
  - name: reflection
    conditions:
      - A vertical yellow line exists.
      - All pattern pixels are located entirely on one side (left or right) of the vertical line.
    action:
      - The entire region (all rows) on the side containing the pattern pixels is reflected horizontally across the vertical yellow line onto the other side.
      - Source pixels at `(r, c)` map to destination pixels based on the vertical line column `vc`:
          - If pattern is left (`c < vc`), map to `(r, vc + (vc - c))`.
          - If pattern is right (`c > vc`), map to `(r, vc - (c - vc))`.
    priority: Higher than horizontal copy.
  - name: copy
    conditions:
      - No vertical yellow line exists OR the conditions for vertical reflection are not met.
      - A horizontal yellow line exists.
      - All pattern pixels are located entirely on one side (above or below) of the horizontal line.
    action:
      - The entire region (all columns) on the side containing the pattern pixels is copied vertically (without reflection) across the horizontal yellow line onto the other side, adjacent to the line.
      - Source pixels at `(r, c)` map to destination pixels based on the horizontal line row `hr`:
          - If pattern is above (`r < hr`), map to `(hr + 1 + r, c)`.
          - If pattern is below (`r > hr`), map to `(hr - 1 - (r - (hr + 1)), c) = (hr - (r-hr), c)`.
    priority: Lower than vertical reflection.
  - name: no_transformation
    conditions:
      - No yellow line exists.
      - Yellow line(s) exist, but pattern pixels do not meet the location criteria (e.g., pattern pixels are on both sides of the line, or no pattern pixels exist).
    action:
      - The output grid is identical to the input grid.

validation_criteria:
  - The transformed grid must match the expected output grid exactly in dimensions, pixel values, and pixel locations.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  **Identify Features:**
    *   Scan the grid rows to find the row index (`hr`) of a complete horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels, if one exists.
    *   Scan the grid columns to find the column index (`vc`) of a complete vertical line of yellow (4) pixels, if one exists.
    *   Locate all "pattern pixels" (pixels that are not background/white (0) and not yellow (4)). If no pattern pixels exist, stop and return the initial grid copy.
3.  **Apply Transformation Logic (Prioritized):**
    *   **Check Vertical Reflection:**
        *   If a vertical yellow line (`vc`) exists:
            *   Check if *all* pattern pixels are to the left (`column < vc`). If yes, reflect the entire region left of `vc` (columns 0 to `vc-1`, all rows) horizontally across `vc` onto the right side (columns `vc+1` onwards). Update the output grid and stop.
            *   Else, check if *all* pattern pixels are to the right (`column > vc`). If yes, reflect the entire region right of `vc` (columns `vc+1` to `width-1`, all rows) horizontally across `vc` onto the left side (columns 0 to `vc-1`). Update the output grid and stop.
    *   **Check Horizontal Copy (Fallback):**
        *   If the vertical reflection conditions were not met *and* a horizontal yellow line (`hr`) exists:
            *   Check if *all* pattern pixels are above (`row < hr`). If yes, copy the entire region above `hr` (rows 0 to `hr-1`, all columns) vertically to the region starting just below `hr` (row `hr+1` onwards). Update the output grid and stop.
            *   Else, check if *all* pattern pixels are below (`row > hr`). If yes, copy the entire region below `hr` (rows `hr+1` to `height-1`, all columns) vertically to the region starting just above `hr` (row `hr-1` backwards towards row 0). Update the output grid and stop.
4.  **No Action:** If none of the above conditions were met, return the initial grid copy unchanged.
