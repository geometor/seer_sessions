"""
The transformation rule identifies all red pixels (color 2) in the input grid. 
For each red pixel, it examines its 8 neighboring pixels (including diagonals).
If a neighbor is gray (color 5), it is changed to orange (color 7) in the output grid.
If a neighbor is white (color 0), it is changed to yellow (color 4) in the output grid.
All other pixels, including the red pixels themselves, retain their original color. 
A single white or gray pixel can be affected by multiple adjacent red pixels, but the outcome (yellow or orange) remains the same.
