"""
Identifies the largest hollow rectangular frame in the input grid. 
Extracts the subgrid defined by the frame's bounding box.
Within the interior of this subgrid (excluding the frame itself), identifies three key colors:
1. Frame Color (`C_frame`): The color of the hollow rectangle border.
2. Interior Background Color (`C_internal_bg`): The most frequent color in the interior, excluding the frame color.
3. Interior Object Color (`C_object`): The single color present in the interior that is neither the frame color nor the interior background color.

Calculates the set of relative row indices (`R_obj`) and column indices (`C_obj`) occupied by the `C_object` pixels within the interior.

Transforms the extracted subgrid: Iterates through each pixel in the interior of the subgrid. If a pixel has the `C_internal
