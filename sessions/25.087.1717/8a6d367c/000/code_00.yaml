elements:
  - role: background
    color: azure (8)
    description: The predominant color filling most of the grid space.
  - role: distractor_objects
    description: Various small, contiguous or scattered pixel groups of different colors (blue, red, yellow, green, magenta, maroon), usually located away from the main frame structure. They do not form hollow rectangles and are not present in the output.
  - role: target_frame
    description: A hollow, single-pixel-thick, rectangular object made of a single, non-background color (maroon 9, green 3, yellow 4 in examples). This object defines the region of interest.
    properties:
      - shape: hollow_rectangle
      - thickness: 1 pixel
      - color: variable (non-background)
      - location: variable within the grid
      - size: variable, appears to be the largest such frame by bounding box area in the input.
  - role: frame_content
    description: The pixels enclosed within the target_frame. Can include background color pixels and potentially other shapes or patterns.

actions:
  - name: identify_background_color
    description: Determine the most frequent color in the input grid.
  - name: find_objects
    description: Locate all contiguous groups of pixels (objects) that are not the background color.
  - name: filter_hollow_rectangles
    description: From the found objects, select only those that form a hollow rectangular shape.
  - name: select_largest_frame
    description: Identify the hollow rectangular object with the largest bounding box area.
  - name: extract_subgrid
    description: Crop the input grid to the bounding box coordinates of the selected largest frame.

relationships:
  - type: bounding_box
    description: The target_frame defines a rectangular area (its bounding box) within the input grid.
  - type: containment
    description: The frame_content is contained within the target_frame.
  - type: extraction
    description: The output grid is an exact copy of the subgrid defined by the bounding box of the target_frame in the input.
