Scattered within this background are various smaller objects or patterns, often concentrated in one region (e.g., the top). A distinct, larger structure is present in another region (e.g., the bottom half).\n2.  **Key Structure:** This larger structure consistently appears as a hollow rectangular frame made of a single color (maroon 9 in train_1, green 3 in train_2, yellow 4 in train_3). The area inside this frame contains other colors, including the background color.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid seems to be a direct extraction of the rectangular region defined by the bounding box of the hollow frame found in the input. The output grid includes the frame itself and all the pixels originally inside it.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the specific hollow rectangular frame object within the input and cropping the input grid to the exact dimensions and content of this frame's bounding box. The other elements outside this frame in the input are discarded.\n5.  **Color Invariance:** The colors within the extracted region are preserved exactly as they were in the input. The color of the frame itself is also preserved.\n6.  **Frame Selection:** If there were multiple frames, the examples suggest selecting the one with the largest bounding box area. The background color (azure 8) is never used for the frame.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
