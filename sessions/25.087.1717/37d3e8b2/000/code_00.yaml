facts:
  - grid_dimensions: input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - background_color: white (0) pixels remain unchanged.
  - target_color: azure (8) pixels in the input are the target for transformation.
  - objects: contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels form distinct objects (using 4-connectivity).
  - object_preservation: the shape and location of each object are preserved in the output.
  - transformation: recoloring azure objects based on a global property.
  - global_property: the total count (N) of azure objects in the input grid.
  - color_palettes_implicit: the set of output colors used depends on N.
      - N=4 uses {Green(3), Orange(7)}.
      - N=5 uses {Blue(1), Red(2), Green(3)}.
      - N=6 uses {Blue(1), Red(2), Green(3), Orange(7)}.
  - spatial_dependency: the specific color assigned to an object depends on its vertical position relative to the grid's horizontal midline.
      - Objects are classified as 'Above' or 'Below' the midline.
  - assignment_logic:
      - A specific sequence of colors (SeqA) is assigned cyclically to 'Above' objects (in their discovery order).
      - A specific sequence of colors (SeqB) is assigned cyclically to 'Below' objects (in their discovery order).
      - The sequences SeqA and SeqB are determined by N.
          - N=4: SeqA=[3], SeqB=[7]
          - N=5: SeqA=[1, 3], SeqB=[2, 1]
          - N=6: SeqA=[2, 3], SeqB=[2, 1, 2, 7]
