Transformation Rule:
1. Identify all distinct contiguous objects of azure (8) pixels using 4-way adjacency.
2. Order these objects based on their top-most, then left-most pixel coordinate.
3. Count the total number of objects (N).
4. Classify each object as 'Above' or 'Below' based on its vertical center relative to the grid's horizontal midline.
5. Select two color sequences, SeqA (for Above) and SeqB (for Below), based on N:
    - N=4: SeqA=[3], SeqB=[7]
    - N=5: SeqA=[1, 3], SeqB=[2, 1]
    - N=6: SeqA=[2, 3], SeqB=[2, 1, 2, 7]
    - Default: No change / specific default sequence if N is not 4, 5, or 6.
6. Assign colors cyclically from SeqA to 'Above' objects and from SeqB to 'Below' objects, respecting their original discovery order within each group.
7. Recolor the pixels of each original azure object with its newly assigned color in the output grid.
