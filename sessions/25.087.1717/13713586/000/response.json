            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels.\n2.  **Key Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), gray (5), and various other colors (red, green, orange, yellow, azure, magenta). White seems to be the background color. Gray appears as a single, straight line along one edge of the grid in each example.\n3.  **Objects:** The non-white, non-gray pixels form distinct, often small, objects (lines or small blocks) in the input grid.\n4.  **Transformation:** In the output grid, the original colored objects appear to have been \"extended\" or \"streaked\" in a specific direction. The extension seems to fill the space between the original object and the gray border, or between one object and another object located \"between\" it and the gray border.\n5.  **Gray Border Role:** The gray line acts as a boundary or a reference point. The direction of the color extension seems directly related to the location of this gray border.\n    *   In `train_1`, the gray border is on the right edge (column 16). Colors extend horizontally to the right.\n    *   In `train_2`, the gray border is on the bottom edge (row 15). Colors extend vertically downwards.\n    *   In `train_3`, the gray border is on the left edge (column 0). Colors extend horizontally to the left.\n6.  **Filling Logic:** The extension or filling happens along lines (rows or columns) parallel to the gray border. If a line contains multiple colors, the color closest to the start of the fill path (farthest from the gray border) dictates the fill color until the next color is encountered along that path. The fill then continues with the new color. The filling proceeds *towards* the gray border.\n7.  **Output Grid:** The output grid retains the gray border and the filled/extended colored regions. The original background (white) pixels are replaced by the fill color where applicable.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

It will be either a single full row (top or bottom) or a single full column (left or right).\n3.  Determine the fill direction based on the border location:\n    *   If the border is the top row, the fill direction is UP. Process columns individually.\n    *   If the border is the bottom row, the fill direction is DOWN. Process columns individually.\n    *   If the border is the left column, the fill direction is LEFT. Process rows individually.\n    *   If the border is the right column, the fill direction is RIGHT. Process rows individually.\n4.  Iterate through each line (row or column) that is perpendicular to the gray border.\n5.  For each line:\n    a.  Initialize a variable `current_fill_color` to white (0).\n    b.  Iterate through the pixels of this line, starting from the edge *opposite* the gray border and moving *towards* it.\n    c.  For each pixel P in the input line:\n        i.  If the color of pixel P is *not* white (0) and *not* gray (5), update `current_fill_color` to the color of P.\n        ii. Set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output line to the `current_fill_color`.\n6.  Ensure the original gray border line is preserved in the final output grid (step 1 handles this if the copy is made initially, otherwise, copy it over after processing).\n7.  Return the modified output grid."
