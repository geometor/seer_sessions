- task_type: object_transformation
- grid_properties:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - contains_border: true
        - border_color: gray (5)
        - border_location: single full row or column along one edge (top, bottom, left, or right)
        - border_is_static: true (copied directly to output)
- objects:
    - type: discrete colored shapes (pixels, lines, small blocks)
    - colors: various (non-white, non-gray)
    - location: scattered within the grid, excluding the border
- relationships:
    - spatial_relation: colored objects relative to the gray border
    - spatial_relation: multiple colored objects may exist on the same line (row/column) perpendicular to the border
- actions:
    - identify_border: locate the gray border row or column
    - determine_fill_direction: establish the direction towards the gray border (up, down, left, or right)
    - line_processing: iterate through lines (rows or columns) perpendicular to the border
    - color_propagation:
        - starting_point: begin processing each line from the edge opposite the gray border
        - state: maintain the 'last seen non-white, non-gray color' encountered along the line
        - rule: fill each cell in the output line with the 'last seen color'
        - update: update the 'last seen color' whenever a new non-white, non-gray pixel is encountered in the input line
    - output_generation: create the output grid by applying the propagated colors and copying the gray border
