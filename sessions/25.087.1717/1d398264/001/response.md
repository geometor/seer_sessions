Identify the median row containing non-white pixels in the input grid. This row is designated as the 'middle row'.
Fill the entire middle row in the output grid with the color of the rightmost non-white pixel found on that middle row in the input grid.
Then, overlay the original non-white pixels from the input grid's middle row onto the output grid's middle row.
For each non-white pixel in the input grid *above* the middle row, project its color diagonally up and to the left in the output grid until the grid boundary is reached.
For each non-white pixel in the input grid *below* the middle row, project its color diagonally down and to the left in the output grid until the grid boundary is reached.
The output grid starts as a white grid of the same size as the input.
