            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input Structure**: The input grids contain a small number of distinct, compact objects composed of non-white pixels, set against a white background. These objects appear to be consistently arranged in three vertical tiers: a top object/group, a middle object/group, and a bottom object/group.\n2.  **Output Structure**: The output grids show transformations applied to the input objects. The original objects are still somewhat discernible, but they have been expanded or projected.\n3.  **Key Transformation - Middle Object**: There is a distinct transformation applied to the object located in the middle vertical tier. This object seems to define a horizontal line across the entire grid width. The color of this line is determined by the rightmost pixel of the original middle object. The original pixels of the middle object are preserved and overlaid onto this line.\n4.  **Key Transformation - Other Objects**: Objects located above the middle tier undergo a diagonal projection. Each pixel of the original object generates a line extending diagonally upwards and to the left until it hits the grid boundary. Objects located below the middle tier also undergo a diagonal projection, but downwards and to the left, again stopping at the grid boundary.\n5.  **Color Preservation**: The colors of the original pixels are preserved in their respective projections and in the overlaid middle object pixels. The background remains white unless painted over by a projection or the middle row fill.\n6.  **Object Integrity**: While pixels project, the original relative positions within the source objects seem important, especially for determining the middle object and its rightmost pixel's color.\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"
