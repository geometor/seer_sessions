            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided Python code implements a specific transformation logic: identify a median \"middle row\" based on non-white pixel distribution, fill that row with the color of its rightmost non-white pixel, overlay the original pixels onto that filled row, and project pixels above/below the middle row diagonally up-left/down-left, respectively.\n\nUpon reviewing the `Expected Output` vs. `Transformed Output` for all three examples, there's a consistent pattern:\n1.  The identification of the middle row seems correct in all examples.\n2.  The filling of the middle row with the color of the rightmost pixel and the subsequent overlaying of the original middle row pixels also appears correct according to the `Expected Output`.\n3.  The significant discrepancy lies in the projection logic. The `Transformed Output` text description in the previous step's feedback suggests the code might be copying *entire row segments* diagonally, whereas the `Expected Output` clearly shows *individual pixels* being projected along their respective diagonals (up-left or down-left).\n\nHowever, looking closely at the provided Python code, the functions `project_up_left` and `project_down_left` *do* operate on individual pixels `(r_start, c_start)` and project their `color` along the diagonal. This matches the logic required to produce the `Expected Output`.\n\nTherefore, the most likely scenario is that the code *is* logically correct according to the intended transformation seen in the `Expected Output` grids, but the textual representation of the `Transformed Output` in the feedback was inaccurate or represented a different (incorrect) transformation attempt.\n\nOur strategy will be to refine the natural language program based on the original code's logic, assuming it correctly reflects the transformation needed to match the `Expected Output` grids.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n"

            "text": "**Updated Assessment based on Metrics:**\n\nThe metrics confirm the middle row calculation and fill color logic for Examples 1 and 2 align with the `Expected Output`. However, for **Example 3**, the `middle_row_logic_matches_expected` is `False`. Let's re-examine Example 3's middle row (row 2) in the input vs. expected output:\n\n*   Input row 2, cols 2-4: `[2, 8, 7]` (red, azure, orange)\n*   Calculated fill color (rightmost): 7 (orange)\n*   Expected Output row 2: `[2, 2, 2, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]`\n*   Code Logic Output row 2: `[7, 7, 2, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]`\n\nThe discrepancy in Example 3 is subtle:\n1.  The expected output fills the middle row (row 2) with orange (7).\n2.  It overlays the original pixels `[2, 8, 7]` at columns `[2, 3, 4]`.\n3.  The code performs the fill and overlay correctly. *However*, the metric check failed. Let's re-run the check logic mentally for Example 3:\n    *   Middle row = 2. Fill color = 7. Original middle cols = {2, 3, 4}. Input middle row = `[0,0,2,8,7,0,...]`\n    *   Expected middle row = `[?, ?, 2, 8, 7, 7, ...]` (cols 0, 1 are TBD by projection)\n    *   Checking columns:\n        *   Col 0: Not in `original_middle_cols`. Expected pixel = `?`. Code would fill with 7. *Need to see full expected output row 2.* The provided Expected Output shows `[2, 2, 2, 8, 7, 7, ...]`. Ah, the expected output has colors `2` (red) at columns 0, 1, and 2. But the code would fill columns 0 and 1 with `7` (orange). The expected pixel at column 2 *is* the original `2`.\n        *   Col 1: Not in `original_middle_cols`. Expected pixel = `2`. Code would fill with 7. Mismatch.\n        *   Col 2: In `original_middle_cols`. Expected pixel = `2`. Original pixel = `2`. Match.\n        *   Col 3: In `original_middle_cols`. Expected pixel = `8`. Original pixel = `8`. Match.\n        *   Col 4: In `original_middle_cols`. Expected pixel = `7`. Original pixel = `7`. Match.\n        *   Col 5 onwards: Not in `original_middle_cols`. Expected pixel = `7`. Code fills with 7. Match.\n\nThe metric check correctly identified a mismatch because the expected output for row 2, columns 0 and 1, does not match the fill color (7). Why are columns 0 and 1 red (2) in the expected output? This must be due to the **up-left projection** from row 1.\n*   Input row 1 pixel: (1, 2), color 2 (red).\n*   Projection up-left: (0, 1), color 2.\nThis explains the red (2) at (0, 1).\n*   Where does the red (2) at (0, 0) come from? There's no pixel in row 1 that projects to (0,0).\n*   Wait, re-reading the *Expected Output* for Example 3:\n    *   Row 0: `[0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 7, 0, ...]`\n    *   Row 1: `[0, 0, 2, 5, 7, 0, ...]` (This is from Input)\n    *   Row 2: `[2, 2, 2, 8, 7, 7, ...]` (Middle row, filled orange, overlaid [2,8,7], but cols 0,1,2 are red?)\n\nLet's re-examine the projection rules and middle row handling.\n*   Middle row = 2. Fill color = 7 (orange).\n*   Pixels *above* (row 1): (1,2, **red 2**), (1,3, gray 5), (1,4, orange 7) -> Project **up-left**.\n*   Pixels *below* (row 3): (3,2, green 3), (3,3, green 3), (3,4, green 3) -> Project **down-left**.\n*   Middle row (row 2): Fill with 7, overlay (2,2, **red 2**), (2,3, azure 8), (2,4, orange 7).\n\nApplying projections to an empty grid, then handling the middle row:\n1.  **Projections:**\n    *   (1,2, **red 2**) projects up-left to (0,1, **red 2**).\n    *   (1,3, gray 5) projects up-left to (0,2, gray 5).\n    *   (1,4, orange 7) projects up-left to (0,3, orange 7).\n    *   (3,2, green 3) projects down-left to (4,1, green 3), (5,0, green 3).\n    *   (3,3, green 3) projects down-left to (4,2, green 3), (5,1, green 3), (6,0, green 3).\n    *   (3,4, green 3) projects down-left to (4,3, green 3), (5,2, green 3), ..., (14,0, green 3).\n2.  **Middle Row Handling:**\n    *   Fill row 2 with orange 7: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, ...]`\n    *   Overlay original pixels: Replace (2,2) with **red 2**, (2,3) with azure 8, (2,4) with orange 7. Row 2 becomes `[7, 7, 2, 8, 7, 7, ...]`\n\nCombining projections and middle row: The order matters. Does projection happen first, then middle row fill/overlay? Or vice-versa? Or simultaneously?\n\nLet's assume projection happens onto the final grid *after* the middle row is prepared.\n*   Middle Row prepared: `[7, 7, 2, 8, 7, 7, ...]`\n*   Project (1,2, **red 2**) -> (0,1, **red 2**).\n*   Project (1,3, gray 5) -> (0,2, gray 5).\n*   Project (1,4, orange 7) -> (0,3, orange 7).\n*   Project (3,2, green 3) -> (4,1, green 3), (5,0, green 3).\n*   ... (other projections) ...\n\nResulting Rows (partial):\n*   Row 0: `[0, 2, 5, 7, 0, ...]` (Matches expected!)\n*   Row 1: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]` (From initial white grid)\n*   Row 2: `[7, 7, 2, 8, 7, 7, ...]` (From middle row logic)\n*   Row 3: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`\n*   Row 4: `[0, 3, 3, 3, 0, ...]` (From projection)\n*   Row 5: `[3, 3, 3, 0, 0, ...]` (From projection)\n\nThis *almost* matches the expected output, but row 2 is still wrong `[7, 7, 2, 8, 7, ...]` vs expected `[2, 2, 2, 8, 7, ...]`.\n\nWhat if the projection *overwrites* the middle row?\n*   If (1,2, **red 2**) projects up-left, it writes to (0,1). It does *not* affect row 2.\n*   If (3,2, green 3) projects down-left, it writes to (4,1), (5,0). It does *not* affect row 2.\n\nWhere could the red (2) in columns 0, 1, and 2 of row 2 in the expected output come from?\n*   Col 2: Comes from the overlay of the original pixel (2,2, **red 2**). This part is correct.\n*   Col 1: Cannot come from projection. Cannot come from overlay. Must come from the initial **fill**.\n*   Col 0: Cannot come from projection. Cannot come from overlay. Must come from the initial **fill**.\n\nThis implies the **fill color** for the middle row in Example 3 should be **red (2)**, not orange (7). Why would it be red? The rule \"color of the rightmost non-white pixel found on that middle row\" gives orange (7) from pixel (2,4).\n\nIs there another rule? Let's re-examine the middle rows and fill colors:\n*   Ex 1: Middle row 7. Pixels: (7,15,4), (7,16,5), (7,17,4). Rightmost color = 4 (yellow). Expected fill = 4 (yellow). Correct.\n*   Ex 2: Middle row 3. Pixels: (3,3,2), (3,4,6), (3,5,2). Rightmost color = 2 (red). Expected fill = 2 (red). Correct.\n*   Ex 3: Middle row 2. Pixels: (2,2,2), (2,3,8), (2,4,7). Rightmost color = 7 (orange). Expected fill = 2 (red). **INCORRECT**.\n\nHypothesis Revision: The fill color is *not* simply the rightmost pixel's color on the middle row. What else could determine the fill color?\n*   Leftmost pixel color? Ex1: 4 (correct). Ex2: 2 (correct). Ex3: 2 (correct!).\n*   Most frequent color? Ex1: 4 (correct). Ex2: 2 (correct). Ex3: Not applicable (all unique or tied).\n*   Color of the pixel at the median *column* of the non-white pixels on that row?\n    *   Ex1: Cols [15, 16, 17]. Median col 16. Color 5 (gray). Incorrect.\n    *   Ex2: Cols [3, 4, 5]. Median col 4. Color 6 (?). Incorrect.\n    *   Ex3: Cols [2, 3, 4]. Median col 3. Color 8 (azure). Incorrect.\n\nThe most consistent rule across all three examples for the middle row fill color seems to be the **color of the leftmost non-white pixel on the identified middle row**.\n\nLet's update the logic based on this new hypothesis.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Pixels are projected diagonally, and the central axis row receives special processing.\n\ndefinitions:\n  - name: grid\n    type: 2D array of integers 0-9 (colors)\n  - name: pixel\n    type: tuple (row, column, color) where color != 0 (white)\n  - name: active_rows\n    type: sorted list of unique row indices containing non-white pixels\n  - name: middle_row_index\n    type: integer index = len(active_rows) // 2\n  - name: middle_row\n    type: integer row index = active_rows[middle_row_index]\n  - name: middle_row_pixels\n    type: list of non-white pixels from the input grid whose row index equals middle_row\n\nprocessing_steps:\n  - step: 1. Initialization\n    action: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized with white (0).\n    condition: Always performed.\n  - step: 2. Identify Middle Row\n    action: Find all non-white pixels in the input grid. Determine the set of unique 'active_rows'. Calculate the 'middle_row' as the median row index from the sorted 'active_rows'.\n    condition: Only if non-white pixels exist. If none exist, return the empty white grid.\n  - step: 3. Determine Fill Color\n    action: Identify all 'middle_row_pixels'. Find the pixel among these with the smallest column index (leftmost). The color of this leftmost pixel is the 'fill_color'.\n    condition: Only if 'middle_row_pixels' exist. If the middle row has no pixels (edge case, shouldn't happen if active_rows calculation is correct), default fill is white (0).\n  - step: 4. Fill Middle Row\n    action: Set all pixels in the 'middle_row' of the output grid to the determined 'fill_color'.\n    condition: If 'middle_row' was identified.\n  - step: 5. Overlay Middle Row Pixels\n    action: For each original non-white pixel located on the 'middle_row' in the input grid, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid's 'middle_row' to its original color (overwriting the fill color at that specific column).\n    condition: If 'middle_row' was identified.\n  - step: 6. Project Other Pixels\n    action: Iterate through all non-white pixels in the input grid.\n      - If a pixel's row is *less than* 'middle_row', project its color diagonally up and to the left (`r-1, c-1`) onto the output grid until a grid boundary (row < 0 or col < 0) is reached. Each step of the projection overwrites the existing color in the output grid.\n      - If a pixel's row is *greater than* 'middle_row', project its color diagonally down and to the left (`r+1, c-1`) onto the output grid until a grid boundary (row >= max_rows or col < 0) is reached. Each step of the projection overwrites the existing color in the output grid.\n      - Pixels *on* the 'middle_row' are *not* projected; they were handled in Step 5.\n    condition: If 'middle_row' was identified. Projection overwrites any color previously set (including the middle row fill if diagonals cross it, though this specific interaction needs confirmation - based on examples, it seems projection doesn't overwrite the final middle row state). Revisit: Based on Example 3 results, projections *do* seem to happen independently and might overwrite parts of the initially filled middle row *before* the overlay step, or the overlay takes final precedence. The simplest model consistent with outputs is: fill middle row, overlay middle row originals, then project other pixels onto the grid (potentially overwriting). Let's stick with the description from the code: Fill, Overlay, Project. The projection functions modify the grid directly.\n\noutput: The final state of the output grid after all steps are completed.\n```"
