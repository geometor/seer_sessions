*   **Perception:** The task involves identifying nested structures or layered objects within a larger grid. The input grids typically feature one or more rectangular objects, each of a single color, placed within another, against a background color. The output grid is always a smaller square grid that seems to represent a "zoomed-in" view focused on the centermost or innermost object and its immediate context. The size of the output grid varies between examples.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Extract a square subgrid centered on the innermost non-background object.
    
    elements:
      - role: background
        description: The predominant color filling the grid, surrounding all other objects.
        properties: Usually the most frequent color, often found at the grid borders.
      - role: object
        description: A contiguous region of a single non-background color.
        properties: Often rectangular, can be nested (contained within another object).
      - role: innermost_object
        description: The object that is not surrounding any other distinct non-background object. It is the deepest layer in the nesting.
        properties: Key element for determining the center of the output.
      - role: nested_layers
        description: The sequence of distinct non-background colors encountered when moving from the innermost object outwards towards the background.
        properties: The count of these layers determines the output size.
    
    relationships:
      - type: containment
        description: An object of one color can be fully enclosed within an object of another color.
      - type: adjacency
        description: Objects of different colors touch each other.
      - type: centering
        description: The output grid is centered relative to the innermost object in the input grid.
    
    actions:
      - action: identify_background
        description: Determine the background color of the input grid.
      - action: identify_objects
        description: Find all contiguous regions of non-background colors.
      - action: find_innermost_object
        description: Locate the object(s) not containing any other non-background objects. Assume a single one for this task based on examples.
      - action: count_layers
        description: Count the number (N) of distinct non-background colors involved in the nesting structure, including the innermost object's color.
      - action: calculate_output_size
        description: Determine the output grid dimension S = 2*N + 1.
      - action: find_center
        description: Calculate the geometric center coordinates (row, col) of the innermost object's bounding box.
      - action: extract_subgrid
        description: Crop a square region of size S x S from the input grid, centered at the found coordinates.
    
    output_properties:
      - property: size
        value: Square grid of size S x S, where S = 2*N + 1, and N is the number of non-background layers.
      - property: content
        value: A direct copy of the pixels from the input grid within the extracted S x S window.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the background color of the input grid (typically the most frequent color or the color at the corners/edges).
    2.  Identify all contiguous objects of non-background colors.
    3.  Determine the nesting structure: Find the object that is contained within the most layers of other distinct non-background objects (the "innermost" object).
    4.  Count the number of distinct non-background colors (N) involved in the nested structure, starting from the innermost object and moving outwards until the background is reached. Include the color of the innermost object in this count.
    5.  Calculate the required output grid size, S, using the formula S = 2 * N + 1.
    6.  Find the bounding box of the innermost object.
    7.  Calculate the center coordinates (center\_row, center\_col) of this bounding box (e.g., using floor division for average coordinates).
    8.  Create the output grid by extracting an S x S square subgrid from the input grid. The top-left corner of this subgrid in the input is at `(center_row - N, center_col - N)`, and the bottom-right corner is at `(center_row + N, center_col + N)`.
