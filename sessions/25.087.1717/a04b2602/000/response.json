The output introduces blue (1).\n3.  **Key Transformation:** The core change is that some green pixels (3) in the input are changed to blue pixels (1) in the output.\n4.  **Unaltered Pixels:** White pixels (0) and red pixels (2) remain unchanged between input and output in all corresponding positions.\n5.  **Condition for Change:** The transformation of green to blue seems dependent on the proximity of red pixels. Specifically, a green pixel changes to blue *if and only if* it is directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) to a red pixel.\n6.  **Multiple Red Neighbors:** If a green pixel is adjacent to multiple red pixels, it still changes to blue (there's no cumulative effect or different outcome).\n7.  **Objects:** We can consider contiguous blocks of green as objects, and individual red pixels as trigger points or agents causing a change in their immediate green neighbors.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
