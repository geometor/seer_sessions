Grid:
  - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have identical height and width.
Pixels:
  - type: Background
    color: white (0)
    behavior: Remains unchanged.
  - type: Trigger
    color: red (2)
    behavior: Remains unchanged. Acts as a condition for changing adjacent pixels.
  - type: Target
    color: green (3)
    behavior:
      - Changes to blue (1) if directly adjacent (sharing an edge, not just a corner) to at least one red (2) pixel.
      - Remains green (3) if not directly adjacent to any red (2) pixel.
  - type: Result
    color: blue (1)
    behavior: Appears in the output grid in positions where a green (3) pixel was adjacent to a red (2) pixel in the input grid.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Direct horizontal or vertical proximity (sharing an edge) between pixels is the key relationship determining the transformation. Diagonal proximity does not trigger the change.
