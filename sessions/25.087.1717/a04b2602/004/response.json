            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding of the transformation.\n\n## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided Python code implements a transformation rule based on an initial interpretation, likely derived from a subset of the examples or a preliminary hypothesis. The core logic involves identifying green pixels (3) adjacent to red pixels (2) and then using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or flood-fill mechanism to change all connected green pixels to blue (1).\n\nHowever, the results clearly show that this propagation logic is incorrect. Comparing the `Transformed Output` with the `Expected Output` across all three examples reveals a consistent pattern: the blue color (1) in the expected output appears *only* in positions where a green pixel (3) was *directly* (orthogonally) adjacent to a red pixel (2) in the input grid. Green pixels that are part of the same connected component but are *not* directly adjacent to a red pixel remain green (3) in the expected output.\n\nThe strategy is to discard the propagation/flood-fill part of the hypothesis and adopt a simpler, more localized rule: a green pixel changes to blue *if and only if* it is orthogonally adjacent to a red pixel.\n\n## Metrics and Evidence Gathering\n\nLet's verify the pixel differences and analyze the color changes more closely. We can use `numpy` for efficient comparison.\n\n"
