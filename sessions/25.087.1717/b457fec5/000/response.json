            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consist of a white background (color 0), one or more contiguous objects made of gray pixels (color 5), and a single horizontal sequence of other colors (non-white, non-gray) near the top.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are identical to the input grids, except that the gray objects have been \"colored in\". The original non-white, non-gray sequence remains unchanged in its position.\n3.  **Key Elements:**\n    *   **Background:** White pixels (0) remain unchanged.\n    *   **Key Sequence:** A horizontal sequence of non-white (0) and non-gray (5) colors acts as a palette or a repeating pattern. This sequence is preserved in the output.\n    *   **Target Objects:** Contiguous areas of gray pixels (5) are the targets for transformation.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is replacing the gray pixels within each distinct gray object with colors from the key sequence. The colors from the key sequence are applied cyclically to the pixels of each gray object.\n5.  **Coloring Pattern:** The coloring seems to proceed pixel by pixel within each gray object, following the order they are encountered when scanning the grid (likely top-to-bottom, left-to-right). Each distinct gray object uses the key sequence independently, starting from the first color in the sequence for the first gray pixel encountered belonging to that object.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
