Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consist of a white background (color 0), one or more contiguous objects made of gray pixels (color 5), and a single horizontal sequence of other colors (non-white, non-gray) near the top.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are identical to the input grids, except that the gray objects have been "colored in". The original non-white, non-gray sequence remains unchanged in its position.
3.  **Key Elements:**
    *   **Background:** White pixels (0) remain unchanged.
    *   **Key Sequence:** A horizontal sequence of non-white (0) and non-gray (5) colors acts as a palette or a repeating pattern. This sequence is preserved in the output.
    *   **Target Objects:** Contiguous areas of gray pixels (5) are the targets for transformation.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is replacing the gray pixels within each distinct gray object with colors from the key sequence. The colors from the key sequence are applied cyclically to the pixels of each gray object.
5.  **Coloring Pattern:** The coloring seems to proceed pixel by pixel within each gray object, following the order they are encountered when scanning the grid (likely top-to-bottom, left-to-right). Each distinct gray object uses the key sequence independently, starting from the first color in the sequence for the first gray pixel encountered belonging to that object.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - element: background
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - role: Remains unchanged in the output.
  - element: key_sequence
    properties:
      - type: object (horizontal 1D sequence)
      - composition: Contiguous sequence of non-white (0) and non-gray (5) pixels.
      - location: Typically near the top of the grid.
      - uniqueness: Appears to be only one per input grid.
    role: Provides the color palette/pattern for filling target objects. Remains unchanged in the output.
  - element: target_object
    properties:
      - type: object (contiguous region)
      - composition: Made entirely of gray pixels (5).
      - quantity: One or more per input grid.
      - shape: Variable.
    role: The object(s) to be transformed.
transformation:
  - action: identify_key_sequence
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: key_sequence (list of colors), key_location
  - action: identify_target_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_target_objects (each object is a set of pixel coordinates)
  - action: color_target_objects
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - key_sequence
      - list_of_target_objects
    process:
      - Create an output grid, initially copying the input grid.
      - For each distinct target object:
        - Initialize a color index to 0 (pointing to the start of the key_sequence).
        - Iterate through the grid pixels in a defined order (e.g., row-major: top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
        - If a pixel belongs to the current target object:
          - Get the color from key_sequence at the current color index.
          - Replace the gray pixel (5) at this location in the output grid with the fetched color.
          - Increment the color index, wrapping around using the modulo operator based on the length of the key_sequence.
    outputs: output_grid
relationships:
  - The key_sequence dictates the colors used to replace the gray pixels in the target_objects.
  - The replacement happens cyclically, using the colors from the key_sequence in order.
  - Each target_object is colored independently using the same key_sequence, starting the cycle anew for each object based on the scan order.
  - Pixels not part of the key_sequence or target_objects remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to locate the horizontal, contiguous sequence of pixels whose colors are neither white (0) nor gray (5). Store this sequence of colors as the "key sequence".
3.  Identify all distinct connected components (objects) formed by gray pixels (5). Use 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right) to define connectivity.
4.  For each identified gray object:
    a.  Initialize a counter `key_index` to 0. This counter tracks the current position within the key sequence for this specific object.
5.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid by row, from top to bottom, and within each row, by column, from left to right.
6.  For the current pixel at `(row, col)`:
    a.  If the pixel's color in the input grid is gray (5):
        i.  Determine which gray object this pixel belongs to.
        ii. Retrieve the color from the `key sequence` at the `key_index` associated with *that specific object*.
        iii. Update the pixel at `(row, col)` in the output grid with this retrieved color.
        iv. Increment the `key_index` for that object, taking the result modulo the length of the `key sequence` (to ensure cyclic wrapping).
7.  Return the completed output grid.
