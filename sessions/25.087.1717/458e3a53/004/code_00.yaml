task_description: Extract inner colors from framed rectangles and arrange them spatially in the output grid.

input_features:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (colors)
    properties:
      - Contains a background pattern or noise.
      - Contains prominent horizontal and/or vertical lines of a single color forming a grid or separators. This color acts as the 'frame_color'.
      - Contains one or more solid rectangular blocks ('inner_blocks') of various colors ('inner_color').
      - Each 'inner_block' is immediately surrounded by a 1-pixel thick border of the 'frame_color'.

output_features:
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array of integers (colors)
    properties:
      - Dimensions are determined by the spatial arrangement of the input 'inner_blocks'.
      - Each cell corresponds to one 'inner_block' from the input.
      - The color of a cell is the 'inner_color' of the corresponding 'inner_block'.
      - The position of a cell reflects the relative row/column position of the corresponding 'inner_block' in the input grid.

objects:
  - name: framed_rectangle
    properties:
      - inner_color: The color of the solid rectangular block inside the frame.
      - frame_color: The color of the 1-pixel thick border surrounding the inner block. This color is consistent for all framed_rectangles within a single example and typically forms grid lines throughout the input.
      - inner_top_left_coord: The (row, column) coordinate of the top-left pixel of the inner block.
      - inner_shape: Rectangular and solid (all pixels same inner_color).
      - frame_shape: 1-pixel thick border completely enclosing the inner block.

actions:
  - name: identify_frame_color
    description: Determine the single color used for framing the rectangles. This can be inferred by finding the color that forms the most prominent grid-like lines (e.g., horizontal/vertical segments of length >= 3).
    input: input_grid
    output: frame_color

  - name: find_framed_rectangles
    description: Locate all instances of 'framed_rectangle' objects within the input grid using the identified 'frame_color'.
    input: input_grid, frame_color
    output: list of (inner_color, inner_top_left_row, inner_top_left_col) tuples

  - name: determine_output_layout
    description: >
      Collect the unique inner_top_left_row coordinates and sort them to define the output rows.
      Collect the unique inner_top_left_col coordinates and sort them to define the output columns.
      Create mappings from input coordinates to output indices.
    input: list of object coordinates
    output: output_height, output_width, row_map, col_map

  - name: construct_output_grid
    description: >
      Create an empty grid of the determined output dimensions (filled with white/0).
      Place the 'inner_color' of each found 'framed_rectangle' into the output grid at the position determined by its mapped 'inner_top_left_coord'.
    input: output_height, output_width, list of (inner_color, inner_top_left_row, inner_top_left_col), row_map, col_map
    output: output_grid
