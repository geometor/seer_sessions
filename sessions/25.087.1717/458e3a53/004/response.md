The line analysis confirms the visual observation:
*   In Example 1, yellow (4) is overwhelmingly the most common color in lines of length 3 or more.
*   In Example 2, gray (8) is overwhelmingly the most common color in lines of length 3 or more.

This suggests a method to find the frame color: identify the color that forms the most horizontal and vertical line segments of length 3+.

The previous `find_framed_rectangles` logic is likely insufficient because it assumes a simple frame corner and doesn't handle the frame color potentially being part of a larger grid structure or intersecting lines. The revised strategy of identifying the frame color first and then specifically looking for rectangular areas completely enclosed by a 1-pixel thick border of *that* color seems more robust.

Let's refine the natural language program based on this.**General Assessment:**

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying "framed rectangles" and mapping their inner colors to an output grid based on their relative positions. The code fails on both provided examples, producing outputs of incorrect size and content.

*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code produced a 1x1 output `[[1]]` instead of the expected 2x2 `[[1, 8], [0, 3]]`. This indicates it likely only identified the first rectangle (inner color blue/1) or failed to correctly determine the relative positions of all four relevant rectangles.
*   **Example 2 Failure:** The code produced a 2x2 output `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]` instead of the expected 3x3 `[[2, 2, 2], [3, 9, 2], [2, 1, 2]]`. This suggests it might be identifying some rectangles but failing to find all nine or incorrectly mapping their positions, potentially due to the complexity of the grid lines (color gray/8).

The core issue seems to be the definition and detection of the relevant "framed objects." The initial assumption of a simple, distinct frame color different from the background might be too simplistic. The "frame" appears to be constructed from grid lines of a specific color (yellow in Ex1, gray in Ex2), which also act as separators. The code needs to reliably identify this grid/frame color and then find rectangular areas fully enclosed by a 1-pixel border of this color.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Identify Frame Color:** Determine the color used to form the grid lines/frames that enclose the target rectangles. Based on the examples and analysis, this appears to be the color that forms the most significant horizontal and vertical lines (e.g., length 3 or more).
2.  **Locate Framed Rectangles:** Scan the grid to find all solid rectangular blocks of a single color (inner color) that are perfectly enclosed by a 1-pixel thick border of the identified frame color. The frame itself might be part of a larger grid structure.
3.  **Extract Information:** For each valid framed rectangle found, record its inner color and the row/column coordinates of the top-left pixel of the inner block.
4.  **Construct Output Grid:**
    *   Collect all unique row coordinates from the located rectangles and sort them. The number of unique rows determines the output grid height.
    *   Collect all unique column coordinates and sort them. The number of unique columns determines the output grid width.
    *   Create a mapping from the sorted unique row coordinates to output row indices (0, 1, 2...).
    *   Create a mapping from the sorted unique column coordinates to output column indices (0, 1, 2...).
    *   Initialize the output grid with a default color (white/0).
5.  **Populate Output Grid:** Iterate through the recorded rectangles. For each rectangle, use the coordinate mappings to find its position in the output grid and place its inner color there.

**Critique of Metrics Code:** The line analysis code seems flawed. It significantly undercounted the lines compared to the previous run and picked incorrect frame colors (1 for Ex1, 2 for Ex2). The logic for skipping counted pixels (`c += length`, `r += length`) seems to be preventing the detection of overlapping line segments correctly. The previous `analyze_lines` implementation (without the skipping logic) gave more plausible frame colors (4 and 8). Let's stick with the results from the first code execution for identifying frame colors.

*   **Example 1:** Frame color yellow (4). Found 4 objects. Derived output shape (2, 2). Matches expected output shape.
*   **Example 2:** Frame color gray (8). Found 9 objects. Derived output shape (3, 3). Matches expected output shape.

This confirms the refined strategy seems consistent with the examples.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Extract inner colors from framed rectangles and arrange them spatially in the output grid.

input_features:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (colors)
    properties:
      - Contains a background pattern or noise.
      - Contains prominent horizontal and/or vertical lines of a single color forming a grid or separators. This color acts as the 'frame_color'.
      - Contains one or more solid rectangular blocks ('inner_blocks') of various colors ('inner_color').
      - Each 'inner_block' is immediately surrounded by a 1-pixel thick border of the 'frame_color'.

output_features:
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array of integers (colors)
    properties:
      - Dimensions are determined by the spatial arrangement of the input 'inner_blocks'.
      - Each cell corresponds to one 'inner_block' from the input.
      - The color of a cell is the 'inner_color' of the corresponding 'inner_block'.
      - The position of a cell reflects the relative row/column position of the corresponding 'inner_block' in the input grid.

objects:
  - name: framed_rectangle
    properties:
      - inner_color: The color of the solid rectangular block inside the frame.
      - frame_color: The color of the 1-pixel thick border surrounding the inner block. This color is consistent for all framed_rectangles within a single example and typically forms grid lines throughout the input.
      - inner_top_left_coord: The (row, column) coordinate of the top-left pixel of the inner block.
      - inner_shape: Rectangular and solid (all pixels same inner_color).
      - frame_shape: 1-pixel thick border completely enclosing the inner block.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze Input Grid Lines:** Scan the input grid to identify the color that forms the most prominent horizontal and vertical line segments (e.g., segments of length 3 or more). Designate this color as the `frame_color`.
2.  **Find Framed Rectangles:** Search the input grid for all occurrences of solid rectangular blocks (`inner_blocks`) where each block consists of a single color (`inner_color`) different from the `frame_color`, and is perfectly enclosed by a 1-pixel thick border composed solely of the `frame_color`.
3.  **Record Rectangle Properties:** For each valid `framed_rectangle` found, store its `inner_color` and the grid coordinates (row, column) of the top-left pixel of its `inner_block`.
4.  **Determine Output Dimensions and Mapping:**
    *   Collect all unique row coordinates from the recorded top-left positions. Sort these unique rows. The number of unique rows is the `output_height`. Create a mapping from each unique row coordinate to its index (0, 1, ...) in the sorted list.
    *   Collect all unique column coordinates from the recorded top-left positions. Sort these unique columns. The number of unique columns is the `output_width`. Create a mapping from each unique column coordinate to its index (0, 1, ...) in the sorted list.
5.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid with dimensions `output_height` x `output_width`, initializing all cells to white (0).
6.  **Populate Output Grid:** Iterate through the recorded rectangles. For each rectangle, use its stored `inner_color` and its top-left `inner_block` coordinates. Find the corresponding output row index using the row mapping and the output column index using the column mapping. Place the `inner_color` at this (output row, output column) position in the output grid.
7.  **Return Output:** Return the fully populated output grid.
