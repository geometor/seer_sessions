task_description: Extract inner colors from framed rectangles and arrange them in an output grid based on their relative spatial layout.

input_features:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D grid containing pixels of different colors (0-9).
    objects:
      - type: framed_rectangle
        description: A rectangular area consisting of a solid block of an inner color completely enclosed by a 1-pixel thick frame of a different, uniform frame color.
        properties:
          - inner_color: The color filling the inner rectangle.
          - frame_color: The color of the 1-pixel thick border. (Must differ from inner_color)
          - position: Coordinates of the top-left corner of the inner rectangle.
          - size: Height and width of the inner rectangle.
      - type: background
        description: Pixels not part of any framed rectangle, typically white (0).

actions:
  - action: find_objects
    description: Identify all instances of 'framed_rectangle' within the input grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_framed_rectangles
    attributes_extracted:
      - inner_color
      - inner_top_left_row
      - inner_top_left_col

  - action: determine_layout
    description: Calculate the relative grid layout based on the positions of the identified rectangles.
    input: list_of_framed_rectangles
    logic:
      - Extract unique row coordinates (inner_top_left_row) and sort them.
      - Extract unique column coordinates (inner_top_left_col) and sort them.
      - The number of unique rows determines the output grid height.
      - The number of unique columns determines the output grid width.
      - Create mappings from original row/column coordinates to output grid indices (0-based).
    output:
      - output_grid_height
      - output_grid_width
      - row_coordinate_map
      - column_coordinate_map

  - action: construct_output
    description: Create the output grid and populate it with the inner colors according to the determined layout.
    input:
      - output_grid_height
      - output_grid_width
      - row_coordinate_map
      - column_coordinate_map
      - list_of_framed_rectangles
    logic:
      - Initialize an output grid of the calculated dimensions, potentially filled with a default color (e.g., white 0).
      - For each identified framed rectangle:
        - Get its inner_color, inner_top_left_row, inner_top_left_col.
        - Use the coordinate maps to find the corresponding output grid indices (output_row, output_col).
        - Place the inner_color at output_grid[output_row, output_col].
    output: output_grid

output_features:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D grid where each cell's color represents the inner color of a framed rectangle from the input, arranged according to the relative positions of those rectangles.
    properties:
      - dimensions: Determined by the unique row/column positions of the input rectangles.
      - cell_values: Inner colors from the input rectangles.
