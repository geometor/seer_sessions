*   **Perception**:
    The input grids are large and contain complex background patterns. Embedded within these patterns are distinct rectangular objects. Each object consists of a solid block of a single color (the inner color) surrounded by a one-pixel-thick frame of a different, uniform color (the frame color). The frame color can vary between examples (yellow in train_1, azure in train_2). The background pattern and the frame color itself seem irrelevant to the final output. The core task is to identify these framed rectangles, extract their inner colors, and arrange these colors in the output grid according to the relative spatial positions of the rectangles in the input grid. The output grid's dimensions match the grid layout formed by the identified rectangles (e.g., 2x2 in train_1, 3x3 in train_2).

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_identification_and_extraction
    input_features:
      - grid_size: variable (large, e.g., 29x29)
      - background: complex, potentially repeating patterns, includes lines of a single color (e.g., yellow horizontal lines)
      - objects:
          - type: solid rectangles
          - property: uniform inner color (color_A)
          - property: surrounded by a 1-pixel thick frame of a uniform color (color_B)
          - constraint: color_A is not equal to color_B
          - arrangement: positioned in a grid-like layout relative to each other (e.g., 2x2, 3x3)
          - quantity: variable (4 in train_1, 9 in train_2)
          - size: variable (5x5 inner in train_1, 4x4 inner in train_2)
    output_features:
      - grid_size: matches the grid layout dimensions of the identified objects in the input (e.g., 2x2, 3x3)
      - content: composed of the inner colors (color_A) of the identified objects
      - structure: maintains the relative spatial arrangement of the objects from the input grid
    transformation:
      - action: identify all framed rectangular objects in the input
      - action: determine the grid layout (rows and columns) formed by these objects
      - action: extract the inner color of each identified object
      - action: create an output grid with dimensions matching the object layout
      - action: populate the output grid cells with the extracted inner colors, preserving the relative spatial arrangement
    pertinent_information:
      - The background pattern is noise.
      - The frame color is used for object identification but is not part of the output.
      - The exact coordinates and sizes of the rectangles are relevant for identification but only their inner color and relative positions matter for the output.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Scan the input grid to locate all distinct rectangular regions where a block of pixels of a single, uniform inner color is completely enclosed by a one-pixel-thick border of a different, uniform frame color.
    2.  Identify the set of unique inner colors found within these framed rectangles.
    3.  Determine the relative spatial arrangement of these framed rectangles, treating them as elements in a larger grid (e.g., identify how many rows and columns of rectangles exist). Note the top-left corner coordinates of each rectangle's inner color block.
    4.  Create a new output grid whose dimensions (height = number of rectangle rows, width = number of rectangle columns) match the determined grid layout.
    5.  Sort the identified rectangles based on their top-left corner coordinates, first by row (top-to-bottom) and then by column (left-to-right).
    6.  Iterate through the sorted rectangles and place their corresponding *inner color* into the output grid cells, following the determined row and column order. The first rectangle's inner color goes to output[0,0], the second (if in the same row) goes to output[0,1], the first rectangle of the second row goes to output[1,0], and so on.
