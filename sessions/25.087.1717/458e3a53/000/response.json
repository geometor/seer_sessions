Each object consists of a solid block of a single color (the inner color) surrounded by a one-pixel-thick frame of a different, uniform color (the frame color). The frame color can vary between examples (yellow in train_1, azure in train_2). The background pattern and the frame color itself seem irrelevant to the final output. The core task is to identify these framed rectangles, extract their inner colors, and arrange these colors in the output grid according to the relative spatial positions of the rectangles in the input grid. The output grid's dimensions match the grid layout formed by the identified rectangles (e.g., 2x2 in train_1, 3x3 in train_2).\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "

Scan the input grid to locate all distinct rectangular regions where a block of pixels of a single, uniform inner color is completely enclosed by a one-pixel-thick border of a different, uniform frame color.\n    2.  Identify the set of unique inner colors found within these framed rectangles.\n    3.  Determine the relative spatial arrangement of these framed rectangles, treating them as elements in a larger grid (e.g., identify how many rows and columns of rectangles exist). Note the top-left corner coordinates of each rectangle's inner color block.\n    4.  Create a new output grid whose dimensions (height = number of rectangle rows, width = number of rectangle columns) match the determined grid layout.\n    5.  Sort the identified rectangles based on their top-left corner coordinates, first by row (top-to-bottom) and then by column (left-to-right).\n    6.  Iterate through the sorted rectangles and place their corresponding *inner color* into the output grid cells, following the determined row and column order. The first rectangle's inner color goes to output[0,0], the second (if in the same row) goes to output[0,1], the first rectangle of the second row goes to output[1,0], and so on."
