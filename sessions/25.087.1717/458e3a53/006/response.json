            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the failed attempts and refine our understanding of the task.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code attempted to identify a \"frame\" color based on line segments and then find solid rectangles enclosed by this frame. The results show that for both provided training examples, the code produced a minimal `[[0]]` output instead of the expected grids. This indicates a fundamental failure in either identifying the correct frame color or locating the framed rectangles as defined by the previous logic.\n\nThe core assumptions that need re-evaluation are:\n1.  **Frame Identification:** Is the frame color always the one forming the most long lines? Are there other defining characteristics?\n2.  **Framed Object Definition:** Are the objects always solid rectangles? Is the frame always exactly 1 pixel thick and completely surrounding the inner object?\n3.  **Output Construction:** Is the output simply the grid of inner colors arranged according to the top-left corner's relative spatial order?\n\nThe strategy will be:\n1.  Re-examine the examples visually and programmatically to verify the frame color and the nature of the framed objects.\n2.  Use code execution to precisely check the behavior of the previous functions (`find_frame_color`, `find_framed_rectangles_with_color`) on the example inputs.\n3.  Refine the definition of the frame and the objects.\n4.  Update the natural language program based on these refined observations.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n"
