Let the inner shape's color be C_inner and the outer shape's color be C_outer.\n\nThe transformation then determines an expansion thickness 'T'. If the inner shape consists of exactly one pixel, T is 1. Otherwise (if the inner shape has more than one pixel), T is 2.\n\nFinally, the transformation expands outwards from the outer shape by T layers using 8-connectivity (Moore neighborhood). In each expansion step, it identifies all background pixels (color 0) that are adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to the current boundary. The boundary starts as the pixels of the outer shape and grows with each expansion layer. These adjacent background pixels are then colored with C_inner. This process repeats T times. The resulting grid is the output.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_non_background_colors(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the unique non-background colors in the grid.\"\"\"\n    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)\n    # Filter out the background color (0)\n    return [color for color in unique_colors if color != 0]\n\ndef get_pixel_coordinates(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Returns a set of (row, col) tuples for pixels of a given color.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = np.where(grid == color)\n    return set(zip(rows, cols))\n\ndef is_adjacent(grid, r, c, target_color, connectivity=8):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a pixel at (r, c) has a neighbor with target_color.\n    Uses 4-connectivity (orthogonal) or 8-connectivity (orthogonal + diagonal).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    if connectivity == 4:\n        deltas = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n    elif connectivity == 8:\n        deltas = [(dr, dc) for dr in [-1, 0, 1] for dc in [-1, 0, 1] if not (dr == 0 and dc == 0)]\n    else:\n        # Default to 8-connectivity if invalid value provided\n        deltas = [(dr, dc) for dr in [-1, 0, 1] for dc in [-1, 0, 1] if not (dr == 0 and dc == 0)]\n        # print(f\"Warning: Invalid connectivity value.
