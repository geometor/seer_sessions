"""
The transformation identifies two non-background colored shapes in the input grid: an 'outer' shape that borders the background (color 0) and an 'inner' shape completely enclosed by the outer one. Let the inner shape's color be C_inner and the outer shape's color be C_outer.

The transformation then determines an expansion thickness 'T'. If the inner shape consists of exactly one pixel, T is 1. Otherwise (if the inner shape has more than one pixel), T is 2.

Finally, the transformation expands outwards from the outer shape by T layers using 8-connectivity (Moore neighborhood). In each expansion step, it identifies all background pixels (color 0) that are adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to the current boundary. The boundary starts as the pixels of the outer shape and grows with each expansion layer. These adjacent background pixels are then colored with C_inner. This process repeats T times. The resulting grid is the output.
