InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Contains a background color (white, 0).
    - Contains exactly two non-background colors.
  Objects:
    - OuterShape:
        Properties:
          - A contiguous block of pixels of color C_outer.
          - Completely encloses the InnerShape.
          - Touches the Background.
    - InnerShape:
        Properties:
          - A contiguous block of pixels of color C_inner.
          - C_inner is different from C_outer.
          - Completely enclosed by the OuterShape.
          - Does not touch the Background.
    - Background:
        Properties:
          - Pixels with color 0 (white).

Transformation:
  Action: Expand outwards from the OuterShape.
  Parameters:
    - ExpansionColor: C_inner (the color of the InnerShape).
    - ExpansionThickness (T):
        Condition:
          - If the number of pixels in InnerShape == 1, then T = 1.
          - If the number of pixels in InnerShape > 1, then T = 2.
  Process:
    - Start with a copy of the InputGrid.
    - Iterate T times:
        - Find all Background pixels that are adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to any pixel belonging to the OuterShape or pixels already colored with ExpansionColor during previous iterations.
        - Change the color of these found Background pixels to ExpansionColor.

OutputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Contains the original OuterShape and InnerShape.
    - Contains a new frame of color C_inner surrounding the OuterShape.
    - The frame has thickness T.
    - The rest of the grid matches the InputGrid's Background.
