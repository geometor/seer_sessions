I will refer to these as the \"outer shape\" and the \"inner shape\". The outer shape has one color (`C_outer`), and the inner shape has a different color (`C_inner`).\n\nThe transformation involves modifying the background pixels surrounding the outer shape. The output grid retains the original outer and inner shapes exactly as they appeared in the input. Additionally, a new border or frame is drawn around the outer shape, replacing the background pixels. The color of this new frame is the same as the color of the *inner* shape (`C_inner`).\n\nThe thickness of this new frame seems to depend on the size of the inner shape. By observing the examples:\n- If the inner shape consists of only a single pixel (Examples 2 and 4), the frame added in the output is 1 pixel thick.\n- If the inner shape consists of more than one pixel (Examples 1, 3, and 5), the frame added in the output is 2 pixels thick.\n\nThe frame expansion includes pixels that are adjacent orthogonally or diagonally to the outer shape or the previously added frame pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Let the inner shape's color be `C_inner` and the outer shape's color be `C_outer`.\n4.  Count the number of pixels that make up the inner shape.\n5.  Determine the expansion thickness `T`: If the inner shape pixel count is 1, set `T = 1`. Otherwise (if the count is greater than 1), set `T = 2`.\n6.  Define the initial set of \"boundary\" pixels as all pixels belonging to the outer shape (`C_outer`).\n7.  Repeat `T` times:\n    a.  Find all background pixels (color 0) in the current grid that are adjacent (sharing a side or a corner) to any pixel in the current \"boundary\" set.\n    b.
