**Perception:**

The input grid always contains a white background (0) and two distinct non-white colored objects. One object completely encloses the other. I will refer to these as the "outer shape" and the "inner shape". The outer shape has one color (`C_outer`), and the inner shape has a different color (`C_inner`).

The transformation involves modifying the background pixels surrounding the outer shape. The output grid retains the original outer and inner shapes exactly as they appeared in the input. Additionally, a new border or frame is drawn around the outer shape, replacing the background pixels. The color of this new frame is the same as the color of the *inner* shape (`C_inner`).

The thickness of this new frame seems to depend on the size of the inner shape. By observing the examples:
- If the inner shape consists of only a single pixel (Examples 2 and 4), the frame added in the output is 1 pixel thick.
- If the inner shape consists of more than one pixel (Examples 1, 3, and 5), the frame added in the output is 2 pixels thick.

The frame expansion includes pixels that are adjacent orthogonally or diagonally to the outer shape or the previously added frame pixels.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Contains a background color (white, 0).
    - Contains exactly two non-background colors.
  Objects:
    - OuterShape:
        Properties:
          - A contiguous block of pixels of color C_outer.
          - Completely encloses the InnerShape.
          - Touches the Background.
    - InnerShape:
        Properties:
          - A contiguous block of pixels of color C_inner.
          - C_inner is different from C_outer.
          - Completely enclosed by the OuterShape.
          - Does not touch the Background.
    - Background:
        Properties:
          - Pixels with color 0 (white).

Transformation:
  Action: Expand outwards from the OuterShape.
  Parameters:
    - ExpansionColor: C_inner (the color of the InnerShape).
    - ExpansionThickness (T):
        Condition:
          - If the number of pixels in InnerShape == 1, then T = 1.
          - If the number of pixels in InnerShape > 1, then T = 2.
  Process:
    - Start with a copy of the InputGrid.
    - Iterate T times:
        - Find all Background pixels that are adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to any pixel belonging to the OuterShape or pixels already colored with ExpansionColor during previous iterations.
        - Change the color of these found Background pixels to ExpansionColor.

OutputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Contains the original OuterShape and InnerShape.
    - Contains a new frame of color C_inner surrounding the OuterShape.
    - The frame has thickness T.
    - The rest of the grid matches the InputGrid's Background.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the two non-background colors present in the input grid.
3.  Identify the pixels corresponding to each color. One color forms an "outer shape" that borders the background (white, 0), and the other forms an "inner shape" completely surrounded by the outer shape. Let the inner shape's color be `C_inner` and the outer shape's color be `C_outer`.
4.  Count the number of pixels that make up the inner shape.
5.  Determine the expansion thickness `T`: If the inner shape pixel count is 1, set `T = 1`. Otherwise (if the count is greater than 1), set `T = 2`.
6.  Define the initial set of "boundary" pixels as all pixels belonging to the outer shape (`C_outer`).
7.  Repeat `T` times:
    a.  Find all background pixels (color 0) in the current grid that are adjacent (sharing a side or a corner) to any pixel in the current "boundary" set.
    b.  Change the color of these newly found background pixels to `C_inner`.
    c.  Update the "boundary" set to include both the original boundary pixels and the newly colored pixels.
8.  The final state of the grid after `T` iterations is the output grid.
