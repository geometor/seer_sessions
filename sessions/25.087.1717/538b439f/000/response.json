            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples involve a grid with a background color, a prominent line (separator), and distinct shapes (targets) of another color. Other scattered pixels might exist but seem unaffected by the main transformation.\n2.  **Separator Line:** In `train_1`, there's a vertical blue line. In `train_2`, there's a horizontal red line. This line acts as a reference boundary.\n3.  **Target Shapes:** In `train_1`, the targets are azure shapes. In `train_2`, the targets are green shapes. These shapes determine the regions to be filled.\n4.  **Filling Action:** The core transformation involves filling rectangular areas based on the relative positions of the target shapes and the separator line. The fill color depends on which side of the separator the fill occurs and the orientation of the separator.\n5.  **Color Interaction:**\n    *   Vertical Separator (`train_1`): The area *between* a target shape and the separator line is filled with the *separator's color* (blue).\n    *   Horizontal Separator (`train_2`): The area *above* the separator, aligned horizontally with a target shape, is filled with the *target's color* (green). The area *below* the separator, aligned horizontally with a target shape, is filled with the *separator's color* (red).\n6.  **Fill Boundaries:**\n    *   For a vertical separator, the fill happens within the row span of the target shape and the column span between the shape's edge and the separator.\n    *   For a horizontal separator, the fill happens within the column span of the target shape. Vertically, the fill extends from the grid edge to the separator (or separator to grid edge, adjusted). Specifically, in `train_2`, the fill below the separator seems to stop just before the target shape starts (row `separator_index + 1` to `target_min_row - 1`).\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
