**Metrics Analysis:**

*   The code correctly identified 13 differing pixels in Example 1.
*   The primary difference is in the block starting at (5, 10).
*   The input pixel at (5, 10) is azure (8).
*   The expected output has this pixel changed to white (0), and all the white pixels within the corresponding 5x5 block [5:10, 10:15] changed to azure (8).
*   The transformed output left the pixel at (5, 10) as azure (8) and did *not* fill the white pixels in the block [5:10, 10:15], because the previous code explicitly ignored azure as a trigger color.
*   The number of white pixels (12) in the input block (excluding the trigger) corresponds exactly to the pixels that *should* have been changed to azure (8) in the expected output but were left as white (0) in the transformed output.
*   The trigger pixel itself at (5, 10) was expected to change from azure (8) to white (0), but the transformed output left it as azure (8). This accounts for the 13th differing pixel.
*   The trigger pixel at (10, 0) is yellow (4). The expected output changes it to white (0), and the transformed output also correctly changes it to white (0). The filling action for this block was correct in the transformed output.

This confirms the hypothesis: Azure (8) *should* act as a trigger color, just like yellow (4), orange (7), and blue (1) in the examples. White (0) is the only color at the trigger position (top-left of a 5x5 block) that does not trigger a change.

**Final Refinement:** The rule needs to be updated to include azure as a trigger color.**General Assessment**

The provided Python code implements a transformation rule based on identifying 5x5 "pattern units" within the input grid. The logic correctly identifies "trigger pixels" at the top-left corner of these units (coordinates `r, c` where `r` and `c` are multiples of 5). It then uses the color of the trigger pixel to fill white pixels within that 5x5 unit in the output grid, while setting the trigger pixel itself to white.

The code successfully transformed Example 2, indicating the core logic of identifying 5x5 units and using a trigger color for filling is sound.

However, the code failed on Example 1. The discrepancy arises from how azure (8) pixels at trigger locations are handled. The original logic explicitly excluded azure (8) along with white (0) as trigger colors. The analysis of Example 1's expected output shows that an azure (8) pixel at a trigger location *should* indeed trigger the filling process, using azure as the fill color, and the trigger pixel should become white (0). The original code failed because it ignored the azure trigger pixel at (5, 10), leaving that 5x5 block unmodified except for the changes caused by other triggers (which wasn't the case here).

The strategy for resolving the error is to modify the condition that identifies trigger pixels. Instead of excluding both white (0) and azure (8), only white (0) should be excluded. Any non-white color at the trigger location should activate the fill mechanism.

**Facts**

grid_structure:

    - The input and output grids can be conceptually divided into non-overlapping 5x5 blocks (pattern units).
    - The top-left corner of each block has coordinates (row, col) where both row and col are multiples of 5.
    - Grids may not be perfect multiples of 5x5; blocks can be truncated at the edges.

objects:
  - object: pattern_unit
    description: A 5x5 block of pixels.
    properties:
      - size: 5x5 (potentially smaller if truncated at grid edge)
      - location: Defined by top-left corner (r, c) where r % 5 == 0 and c % 5 == 0.
  - object: trigger_pixel
    description: The pixel at the top-left corner of a pattern unit.
    properties:
      - location: (r, c) where r % 5 == 0 and c % 5 == 0.
      - color: The color value of the pixel in the input grid.
      - is_active: True if the color is not white (0).
  - object: fill_area
    description: The set of white (0) pixels within a pattern unit in the input grid.
    properties:
      - location: Relative to the pattern unit's top-left corner.
      - excludes_trigger: Does not include the trigger pixel itself, even if it were white (which it cannot be if it's an active trigger).

actions:
  - action: identify_trigger
    actor: system
    input: input_grid
    output: list of active trigger pixels (location and color)
    rule: Iterate through all coordinates (r, c) where r % 5 == 0 and c % 5 == 0. If input_grid[r, c] is not white (0), it's an active trigger.
  - action: fill_block
    actor: system
    input: active trigger pixel (location trigger_r, trigger_c and color fill_color), input_grid
    output: modified output_grid (initially a copy of input_grid)
    rule:
      - Set output_grid[trigger_r, trigger_c] to white (0).
      - Iterate through pixels (y, x) within the 5x5 block starting at (trigger_r, trigger_c).
      - If y == trigger_r and x == trigger_c, skip.
      - If input_grid[y, x] is white (0), set output_grid[y, x] to fill_color.

state_change:
  - Initial state: output_grid is a copy of input_grid.
  - Intermediate state: For each active trigger pixel identified, the corresponding 5x5 block in output_grid is modified by the fill_block action.
  - Final state: The output_grid after all active trigger pixels have been processed.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify potential "pattern units," which are notionally 5x5 blocks starting at coordinates (row, col) where both row and col are multiples of 5.
3.  Examine the top-left corner pixel (the "trigger pixel") of each pattern unit in the *input* grid.
4.  If the trigger pixel's color is *not* white (0), then it is an "active trigger." Store its color (`fill_color`) and its location (`trigger_row`, `trigger_col`).
5.  For *each* active trigger identified:
    a.  In the *output* grid, change the color of the pixel at the trigger location (`trigger_row`, `trigger_col`) to white (0).
    b.  Consider the 5x5 block associated with this trigger in the *input* grid (from `trigger_row` to `min(trigger_row + 5, height)`, and `trigger_col` to `min(trigger_col + 5, width)`).
    c.  For every pixel within this 5x5 block (excluding the trigger pixel itself at `trigger_row`, `trigger_col`): if that pixel's color in the *input* grid is white (0), change the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to the stored `fill_color`.
6.  Pattern units whose trigger pixel in the input grid is white (0) do not initiate any changes themselves. Their pixels in the output grid remain as they were copied from the input, unless modified by the fill action of an adjacent active trigger (which does not happen in the provided examples due to the structure).
7.  Return the modified output grid.
