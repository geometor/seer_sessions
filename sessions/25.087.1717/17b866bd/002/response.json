This accounts for the 13th differing pixel.\n*   The trigger pixel at (10, 0) is yellow (4). The expected output changes it to white (0), and the transformed output also correctly changes it to white (0). The filling action for this block was correct in the transformed output.\n\nThis confirms the hypothesis: Azure (8) *should* act as a trigger color, just like yellow (4), orange (7), and blue (1) in the examples. White (0) is the only color at the trigger position (top-left of a 5x5 block) that does not trigger a change.\n\n**Final Refinement:** The rule needs to be updated to include azure as a trigger color.**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided Python code implements a transformation rule based on identifying 5x5 \"pattern units\" within the input grid. The logic correctly identifies \"trigger pixels\" at the top-left corner of these units (coordinates `r, c` where `r` and `c` are multiples of 5). It then uses the color of the trigger pixel to fill white pixels within that 5x5 unit in the output grid, while setting the trigger pixel itself to white.\n\nThe code successfully transformed Example 2, indicating the core logic of identifying 5x5 units and using a trigger color for filling is sound.\n\nHowever, the code failed on Example 1. The discrepancy arises from how azure (8) pixels at trigger locations are handled. The original logic explicitly excluded azure (8) along with white (0) as trigger colors. The analysis of Example 1's expected output shows that an azure (8) pixel at a trigger location *should* indeed trigger the filling process, using azure as the fill color, and the trigger pixel should become white (0). The original code failed because it ignored the azure trigger pixel at (5, 10), leaving that 5x5 block unmodified except for the changes caused by other triggers (which wasn't the case here).\n\nThe strategy for resolving the error is to modify the condition that identifies trigger pixels. Instead of excluding both white (0) and azure (8), only white (0) should be excluded. Any non-white color at the trigger location should activate the fill mechanism.\n\n**Metrics**\n"

Examine the top-left corner pixel (the \"trigger pixel\") of each pattern unit in the *input* grid.\n4.

For *each* active trigger identified:\n    a.  In the *output* grid, change the color of the pixel at the trigger location (`trigger_row`, `trigger_col`) to white (0).\n    b.  Consider the 5x5 block associated with this trigger in the *input* grid (from `trigger_row` to `min(trigger_row + 5, height)`, and `trigger_col` to `min(trigger_col + 5, width)`).\n    c.  For every pixel within this 5x5 block (excluding the trigger pixel itself at `trigger_row`, `trigger_col`): if that pixel's color in the *input* grid is white (0), change the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to the stored `fill_color`.\n6.  Pattern units whose trigger pixel in the input grid is white (0) do not initiate any changes themselves. Their pixels in the output grid remain as they were copied from the input, unless modified by the fill action of an adjacent active trigger (which does not happen in the provided examples due to the structure).\n7.
