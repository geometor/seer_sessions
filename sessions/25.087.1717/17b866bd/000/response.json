The top-left pixel of this unit is typically white (0).\n    *   In the input grids, some of these top-left pixels `(r, c)` (where `r` and `c` are multiples of 5) are replaced by other colors (yellow, orange, blue). These act as \"trigger\" pixels.\n    *   In the output grid, the trigger pixels are changed back to white (0).\n    *   The white (0) pixels *inside* the 5x5 unit associated with a trigger pixel are filled with the color of that trigger pixel.\n    *   The azure (8) frame structure remains unchanged.\n    *   If the top-left pixel of a 5x5 unit is white (0) or azure (8) in the input, that unit remains unchanged in the output (unless it's part of the frame itself, which always stays azure).\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
