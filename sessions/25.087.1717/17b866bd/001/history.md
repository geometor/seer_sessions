*   **Perception**:
    *   The input and output grids feature a consistent background pattern composed of 5x5 units.
    *   Each 5x5 unit consists of an azure (8) border and an inner area containing mostly white (0) pixels, arranged in a specific shape. The top-left pixel of this unit is typically white (0).
    *   In the input grids, some of these top-left pixels `(r, c)` (where `r` and `c` are multiples of 5) are replaced by other colors (yellow, orange, blue). These act as "trigger" pixels.
    *   In the output grid, the trigger pixels are changed back to white (0).
    *   The white (0) pixels *inside* the 5x5 unit associated with a trigger pixel are filled with the color of that trigger pixel.
    *   The azure (8) frame structure remains unchanged.
    *   If the top-left pixel of a 5x5 unit is white (0) or azure (8) in the input, that unit remains unchanged in the output (unless it's part of the frame itself, which always stays azure).

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    grid_properties:
      - size: Variable dimensions, but seems structured around multiples of 5.
      - background_color: white (0)
      - structure_color: azure (8)

    objects:
      - object: pattern_unit
        description: A 5x5 block defining the repeating structure.
        properties:
          - location: Tiled across the grid, top-left corners at (r, c) where r%5==0 and c%5==0.
          - components:
              - border: azure (8) pixels forming a hollow square shape within the 5x5 area.
              - interior: white (0) pixels within the azure border.
              - corner: The pixel at the top-left (r, c) of the unit.

      - object: trigger_pixel
        description: A pixel indicating a transformation should occur in its associated pattern_unit.
        properties:
          - location: Must be at the corner (r, c) of a pattern_unit.
          - color: Any color except white (0) or azure (8).
        relationship: Associated with the pattern_unit starting at its location.

    actions:
      - action: identify_triggers
        description: Find all trigger_pixels in the input grid.
        input: input_grid
        output: list of (location, color) for each trigger_pixel.

      - action: modify_unit
        description: Update a pattern_unit in the output grid based on a trigger_pixel.
        input:
          - output_grid (initially a copy of input_grid)
          - trigger_location (r, c)
          - trigger_color
          - corresponding 5x5 block from input_grid
        output: modified output_grid
        steps:
          - Change the pixel at trigger_location (r, c) in output_grid to white (0).
          - Identify all white (0) pixels within the 5x5 input block *excluding* the corner (r,c).
          - Change the corresponding pixels in the output_grid to trigger_color.

    transformation:
      - description: Apply modifications for all identified triggers.
      - steps:
          - Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid.
          - Perform identify_triggers.
          - For each identified trigger (location, color):
              - Perform modify_unit using the trigger info and the relevant 5x5 block from the original input_grid.
          - Return the final output_grid.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Create a new grid, initially identical to the input grid. This will become the output grid.
    2.  Scan the input grid, focusing on the pixels located at coordinates `(row, column)` where both `row` is a multiple of 5 and `column` is a multiple of 5 (e.g., (0,0), (0,5), (5,0), (5,5), etc.).
    3.  For each such pixel found:
        a.  Check its color. If the color is *not* white (0) and *not* azure (8), then this pixel is a "trigger pixel".
        b.  Note the color of the trigger pixel (let's call it `fill_color`).
        c.  In the *output* grid, change the color of the pixel at the trigger pixel's location `(row, column)` to white (0).
        d.  Consider the 5x5 block of pixels in the *input* grid starting from the trigger pixel's location `(row, column)` down to `(row + 4, column + 4)`.
        e.  Iterate through every pixel `(y, x)` within this 5x5 block, *except* for the trigger pixel itself at `(row, column)`.
        f.  If the pixel `(y, x)` in the *input* grid has the color white (0), then change the color of the corresponding pixel `(y, x)` in the *output* grid to the `fill_color` noted in step 3b.
    4.  After checking all potential trigger locations (multiples of 5 for row and column), the output grid contains the final transformed image. Return the output grid.
