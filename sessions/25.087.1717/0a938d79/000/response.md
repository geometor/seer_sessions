Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels, primarily white (0). The grid dimensions vary between examples but remain the same from input to output within a single example.
2.  **Key Objects:** The crucial elements in the input grids are exactly two non-white pixels. Their specific colors and positions are important.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves using the two input non-white pixels to define a repeating pattern that fills a portion of the output grid either horizontally (column-wise) or vertically (row-wise).
4.  **Pattern Determination:**
    *   The two non-white pixels act as "anchors" for the pattern.
    *   The distance and orientation (relative row/column difference) between these two pixels determine whether the pattern repeats vertically or horizontally.
    *   The colors of the two pixels define the colors used in the repeating pattern.
    *   The space (number of white rows/columns) between the initial anchor pixels defines the spacing within the repeating pattern unit.
5.  **Propagation:** The pattern starts from the location of the first anchor pixel (based on row or column index) and propagates either downwards (row-wise) or rightwards (column-wise) until the grid boundary is reached. Rows/columns before the first anchor remain white.

general_rule:
  - Find the two non-white pixels P1(r1, c1, C1) and P2(r2, c2, C2).
  - Determine axis: If abs(c1-c2) == 0 or (abs(r1-r2) != 0 and abs(c1-c2) >= abs(r1-r2)), use row-wise axis. Otherwise, use column-wise axis.
  - Sort pixels by axis index: PA(ra, ca, CA) is the pixel with the smaller index on the chosen axis, PB(rb, cb, CB) is the other.
  - Calculate pattern cycle length: L = (index of PB on axis) - (index of PA on axis) + 1.
  - Create output grid same size as input, filled with white.
  - If row-wise: Iterate rows `r` from `ra` to grid height - 1. If `(r - ra) % L == 0`, fill row `r` with CA. If `(r - ra) % L == L - 1`, fill row `r` with CB.
  - If column-wise: Iterate columns `c` from `ca` to grid width - 1. If `(c - ca) % L == 0`, fill column `c` with CA. If `(c - ca) % L == L - 1`, fill column `c` with CB.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the locations (row, column) and colors of the two non-white pixels present in the input grid. Let's call them Pixel A and Pixel B.
2.  Calculate the absolute difference between their row indices (`row_diff`) and column indices (`col_diff`).
3.  Determine the primary axis for the pattern:
    *   If the column difference (`col_diff`) is zero, the axis is **row-wise**.
    *   Else if the row difference (`row_diff`) is zero, the axis is **column-wise**.
    *   Else if the column difference (`col_diff`) is greater than or equal to the row difference (`row_diff`), the axis is **row-wise**.
    *   Otherwise (if `col_diff` is less than `row_diff`), the axis is **column-wise**.
4.  Based on the determined axis, identify the "first" pixel (the one with the smaller index along that axis) and the "second" pixel. Let the first pixel have color C1 and axis index I1, and the second pixel have color C2 and axis index I2.
5.  Calculate the length of the repeating pattern cycle: `L = I2 - I1 + 1`.
6.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white).
7.  If the axis is **row-wise**:
    *   Iterate through each row `r` starting from row index `I1` down to the last row of the grid.
    *   For each row `r`, calculate its position within the pattern cycle: `pattern_pos = (r - I1) % L`.
    *   If `pattern_pos` is 0, fill the entire output row `r` with color C1.
    *   If `pattern_pos` is `L - 1`, fill the entire output row `r` with color C2.
    *   (Rows between these pattern positions remain white).
8.  If the axis is **column-wise**:
    *   Iterate through each column `c` starting from column index `I1` rightwards to the last column of the grid.
    *   For each column `c`, calculate its position within the pattern cycle: `pattern_pos = (c - I1) % L`.
    *   If `pattern_pos` is 0, fill the entire output column `c` with color C1.
    *   If `pattern_pos` is `L - 1`, fill the entire output column `c` with color C2.
    *   (Columns between these pattern positions remain white).
9.  The final modified grid is the output.
