Task: Generate repeating line patterns based on two pixels.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors).
  - Pixels: Exactly two non-white pixels present.
    - Properties:
      - position: (row, column)
      - color: Integer 1-9

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Background: White (0).
  - Pattern:
    - Type: Repeating lines (full rows or columns).
    - Orientation: Determined by the relative positions of the two input pixels.
      - Rule:
        - If column difference is 0, orientation is horizontal (row-wise pattern).
        - Else if row difference is 0, orientation is vertical (column-wise pattern).
        - Else if column difference >= row difference, orientation is horizontal.
        - Else, orientation is vertical.
    - Colors: The colors of the two input pixels (C1, C2).
    - Placement:
      - Reference Pixels: P1 (color C1, index idx1), P2 (color C2, index idx2), sorted by index along the pattern's orientation axis (idx1 < idx2).
      - Cycle Length (L): Calculated as `(idx2 - idx1) * 2`.
      - Repetition Rule:
        - Lines/columns with color C1 appear at indices `i` (where `i >= idx1`) such that `(i - idx1)` is a multiple of `L`.
        - Lines/columns with color C2 appear at indices `i` (where `i >= idx2`) such that `(i - idx2)` is a multiple of `L`.

Derived_Concepts:
  - Axis: The primary dimension (row or column) along which the pattern repeats.
  - Index: The specific row or column number along the axis.
  - Cycle Length: The number of indices (rows or columns) in one full repetition cycle of the pattern. It is twice the distance (number of steps) between the indices of the two defining pixels along the axis.
  - Pattern Start: The pattern begins at the smaller index (`idx1`) of the two defining pixels.
