"""
Generates a repeating line pattern (horizontal or vertical) based on the 
location and color of two initial non-white pixels.

1. Find the coordinates and colors of the two non-white pixels.
2. Determine the primary axis (row-wise or column-wise) for the pattern based 
   on the relative row and column distances between the two pixels.
   - If column difference is 0, axis is row-wise.
   - Else if row difference is 0, axis is column-wise.
   - Else if column difference >= row difference, axis is row-wise.
   - Otherwise, axis is column-wise.
3. Sort the pixels based on their index along the chosen axis (smaller index first). 
   Let the first pixel be P1 (color C1, index I1) and the second be P2 (color C2, index I2).
4. Calculate the pattern cycle length L = I2 - I1 + 1.
5. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
6. If the axis is row-wise, iterate rows 'r' from I1 downwards.
   - Fill row 'r' with C1 if (r - I1) % L == 0.
   - Fill row 'r' with C2 if (r - I1) % L == L - 1.
7. If the axis is column-wise, iterate columns 'c' from I1 rightwards.
   - Fill column 'c' with C1 if (c - I1) % L == 0.
   - Fill column 'c' with C2 if (c - I1) % L == L - 1.
8. Return the resulting grid.
