Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**1. Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:**
    *   Contains a small block of colors (3 rows, 2 columns) in the top-left corner. These seem to act as a key or legend.
    *   Contains scattered patterns of non-white pixels elsewhere in the grid. These patterns often appear as vertical dashed lines (e.g., `8 0 8 0 8`).
    *   The background is white (0).
*   **Output Grid:**
    *   Contains filled rectangular shapes.
    *   The location, size, and colors of these rectangles correspond to the scattered patterns in the input grid.
    *   Each rectangle has a border color and an interior pattern composed of the border color and the color of the original input pattern.
    *   The background is white (0).
*   **Transformation:**
    *   The transformation identifies the scattered patterns in the input.
    *   For each pattern color, it finds a corresponding "border" color using the key in the top-left corner of the input.
    *   It calculates the bounding box for each pattern.
    *   It draws a rectangle in the output grid corresponding to each bounding box.
    *   The rectangle's border is filled with the border color.
    *   The rectangle's interior is filled based on the original input pattern: input pattern pixels keep their color, while input white pixels within the box take the border color.
    *   The rectangles appear to be drawn in order from left to right, based on their horizontal position.

**2. Facts (YAML):**

        - type: scattered_patterns
          role: pattern_objects
          location: elsewhere in the grid
          characteristics:
            - composed of single, non-white colors
            - often form vertical dashed lines
            - represent distinct objects to be transformed

  - type: grid
    role: output
    attributes:
      size: 20x20
      background_color: white (0)
      components:
        - type: filled_rectangles
          role: transformed_objects
          characteristics:
            - correspond spatially to input scattered_patterns
            - defined by a bounding box
            - have a border_color
            - have an interior_fill pattern mixing border_color and the original pattern_color

relationships_and_actions:
  - action: identify
    target: key_map
    result: color mapping (KeyColor -> BorderColor) derived from column 0 to column 1 within the 3x2 block.

  - action: identify
    target: pattern_objects
    input_grid: input
    result: set of Pattern Colors (PCs) and their pixel coordinates (excluding key_map area).

  - action: determine
    variable: Border Color (BC)
    using: Pattern Color (PC), key_map
    rule: Find PC in column 0 of key_map; corresponding BC is the color in column 1 of the same row.

  - action: calculate
    target: bounding_box
    for_each: Pattern Color (PC)
    using: pixel coordinates of PC
    result: minimal bounding box (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c).

  - action: determine
    variable: processing_order
    for_each: bounding_box
    using: min_c (minimum column index)
    rule: Ascending order (left-to-right).

  - action: generate
    target: output grid
    steps:
      - initialize grid with white (0).
      - process each PC according to processing_order:
        - get PC, BC, and bounding_box.
        - iterate through cells (r, c) within the bounding_box:
          - if (r, c) is on the border: set output pixel to BC.
          - if (r, c) is interior AND input pixel was PC: set output pixel to PC.
          - if (r, c) is interior AND input pixel was white (0): set output pixel to BC.
```


**3. Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0).
2.  **Identify Key Map:** Examine the 3x2 block of pixels at the top-left corner (rows 0-2, columns 0-1) of the input grid. Create a mapping where the color in the first column (`input[row, 0]`) maps to the color in the second column (`input[row, 1]`) for each row (0, 1, 2).
3.  **Identify Pattern Objects:** Find all unique non-white colors present in the input grid *outside* the 3x2 key map block. These are the "Pattern Colors" (PCs). For each PC, record all coordinates where it appears.
4.  **Prepare Pattern Data:** For each identified PC:
    a.  Determine its corresponding "Border Color" (BC) using the key map identified in step 2.
    b.  Calculate the minimal bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column) that encloses all occurrences of this PC.
    c.  Store the PC, its BC, and its bounding box information together.
5.  **Determine Processing Order:** Sort the pattern data structures created in step 4 based on the minimum column index (the left edge) of their bounding boxes, in ascending order (leftmost first).
6.  **Draw Rectangles:** Iterate through the sorted pattern data structures:
    a.  For the current pattern (PC, BC, bounding box):
    b.  Iterate through every cell (row `r`, column `c`) within its bounding box (from `min_r` to `max_r`, `min_c` to `max_c`).
    c.  Check if the cell `(r, c)` is on the border of the bounding box (`r == min_r` or `r == max_r` or `c == min_c` or `c == max_c`).
        i.  If it is on the border, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid `output[r, c]` to the Border Color (BC).
    d.  If the cell `(r, c)` is *not* on the border (it's in the interior):
        i.  Check the color of the *input* grid at the same location: `input[r, c]`.
        ii. If `input[r, c]` is equal to the current Pattern Color (PC), set `output[r, c]` to PC.
        iii. If `input[r, c]` is white (0), set `output[r, c]` to the Border Color (BC).
7.  **Final Output:** The grid modified in step 6 is the final output grid.
