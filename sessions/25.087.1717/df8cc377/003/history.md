Results for code_00.py:
Train Set Error: syntax error:
unexpected indent (<unknown>, line 159)
Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and refine our understanding of the transformation.

## General Assessment

The initial code attempt failed due to a syntax error (`unexpected indent`). This prevents us from evaluating its logical correctness against the examples. However, the core logic described ("Identify hollow rectangles, find a single marker inside, fill the interior with the marker's color, remove the marker") was based on only the first example.

To create a robust solution, we must analyze *all* training examples to confirm or refine this hypothesis. We need to examine the types of shapes present, their properties (like being hollow or solid), the nature of "markers" (are they always single pixels?), their position relative to other shapes, and the exact outcome of the transformation in each case. We will pay close attention to variations between examples that might challenge the initial assumptions.

Our strategy is:
1.  Correct the syntax error conceptually (assuming it's a simple indentation issue).
2.  Analyze each input/output pair systematically using code execution to gather precise data.
3.  Identify common patterns and rules across all examples.
4.  Document these findings in a structured YAML format.
5.  Formulate a revised, comprehensive natural language program describing the transformation.

Input Dimensions: (7, 7)
Input Colors: [0, 2, 5]

Is marker inside rectangle bounds? True
Number of white interior pixels in input: 8
Number of interior pixels filled with marker color in output: 9

```
*Observations 1:*
- Input has a gray (5) hollow rectangle (size 16) and a single red (2) pixel (marker) inside it.
- The interior of the rectangle is mostly white (0), except for the marker.
- Output shows the gray rectangle unchanged.
- The interior area bounded by the rectangle (3x3 area) is now filled with red (2).
- The original marker pixel position is also red.
- The analysis shows the final red component has size 9 (3x3), confirming the fill. The initial description ("remove all original marker pixels") seems incorrect for this example; the marker's location is filled like the rest of the interior. The analysis `num_filled_pixels` correctly counted 9 pixels matching the marker color in the output's interior.

*Observations 2:*
- Input has a blue (1) hollow rectangle (size 20) and a single green (3) pixel (marker) inside it.
- The interior of the rectangle is white (0), except for the marker.
- Output shows the blue rectangle unchanged.
- The interior area bounded by the rectangle (4x4 area) is now filled with green (3).
- The original marker pixel position is also green.
- Consistent with Example 1: find a hollow rectangle, find a single pixel of a different color inside, fill the full interior area (defined by the rectangle's bounds, excluding the border itself) with the marker's color.

```
*Observations 3:*
- Input has an azure (8) hollow rectangle (size 24) and a single yellow (4) pixel (marker) inside it.
- The interior is white except for the marker.
- Output shows the azure rectangle unchanged.
- The interior area bounded by the rectangle (3x7 area) is now filled with yellow (4).
- The original marker pixel position is also yellow.
- Fully consistent with the pattern observed in Examples 1 and 2.

**Summary of Findings:**
- The core operation involves identifying a hollow rectangle object and a single-pixel object ("marker") located strictly within the rectangle's boundaries.
- The rectangle itself remains unchanged in the output.
- The area *strictly inside* the rectangle (i.e., excluding the border pixels) is filled entirely with the color of the marker pixel. This includes the original location of the marker.
- The initial assumption that the marker pixel is removed (set to white) was incorrect; its location is overwritten by the fill color (which is its own color, so the effect is simply being part of the fill).
- All examples show exactly one hollow rectangle and exactly one single-pixel marker inside it. The code should handle cases where these conditions aren't met (e.g., no marker, multiple markers, marker outside, no rectangle), although the examples don't test these scenarios. Based on the examples, we assume these conditions are met.
- The interior of the rectangle in the input is primarily white (0), except for the single marker pixel. The transformation fills *all* interior cells, regardless of their initial color (white or marker color).

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
task_description: Fill the interior of a hollow rectangle based on an internal marker pixel.

definitions:
  - object: background
    definition: Pixels with color 0 (white).
  - object: rectangle_border
    definition: A connected component of non-background pixels forming the perimeter of a rectangle (width >= 3, height >= 3) with no component pixels strictly inside its bounding box.
    properties:
      - color: Any non-background color.
      - hollow: The area strictly inside the bounding box contains at least one background pixel or a marker pixel.
      - connectivity: Cardinal (4-way) or possibly diagonal (8-way) - seems consistent with 4-way based on standard rectangle shape. Code used 4-way.
      - size: Matches the perimeter calculation (2*width + 2*height - 4).
  - object: marker
    definition: A single-pixel connected component of a non-background color.
    properties:
      - color: Any non-background color, distinct from the rectangle border color it's associated with.
      - location: Strictly inside the bounding box of a `rectangle_border` object.
      - count_per_rectangle: Exactly one marker per rectangle observed in examples.
  - object: rectangle_interior
    definition: The set of all pixels strictly inside the bounding box of a `rectangle_border`.
    properties:
      - initial_state: Contains background pixels and exactly one `marker` pixel in input examples.
      - final_state: All pixels within this area take the color of the `marker`.

actions:
  - action: identify
    parameters:
      - object: `rectangle_border`
      - object: `marker`
    description: Locate all instances of `rectangle_border` and `marker` objects in the input grid.
  - action: associate
    parameters:
      - parent_object: `rectangle_border`
      - child_object: `marker`
    description: For each `rectangle_border`, find if there is exactly one `marker` located within its `rectangle_interior`.
  - action: fill
    parameters:
      - target_area: `rectangle_interior` (associated with a `rectangle_border` containing a `marker`)
      - fill_color: Color of the associated `marker`
    description: Change the color of all pixels in the `target_area` to the `fill_color`.

input_output_pairs:
  - example: 1
    input_summary: 7x7 grid, gray (5) hollow rectangle, red (2) marker inside.
    output_summary: Gray rectangle unchanged, 3x3 interior filled with red.
  - example: 2
    input_summary: 8x8 grid, blue (1) hollow rectangle, green (3) marker inside.
    output_summary: Blue rectangle unchanged, 4x4 interior filled with green.
  - example: 3
    input_summary: 7x11 grid, azure (8) hollow rectangle, yellow (4) marker inside.
    output_summary: Azure rectangle unchanged, 3x7 interior filled with yellow.

assumptions:
  - Each relevant input grid contains exactly one hollow rectangle structure.
  - Each hollow rectangle contains exactly one single-pixel marker strictly within its interior.
  - The marker pixel's color is different from the rectangle's border color.
  - The transformation only modifies the interior pixels of the identified rectangle; the border and pixels outside remain unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid to find all distinct connected components of non-white pixels.
2.  **Classify Objects:**
    *   Identify components that form a "hollow rectangle border". A component qualifies if its pixels perfectly match the perimeter of its bounding box and the bounding box has a width and height of at least 3 pixels.
    *   Identify components that consist of exactly one pixel. These are potential "markers".
3.  **Associate Marker with Rectangle:** For each identified hollow rectangle border:
    *   Determine its interior area (all coordinates strictly within its bounding box).
    *   Check if there is exactly one single-pixel marker located within this interior area.
4.  **Perform Transformation:**
    *   If a hollow rectangle is found with exactly one marker inside its interior:
        *   Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
        *   Determine the color of the marker pixel.
        *   Fill the entire interior area of that rectangle in the output grid with the marker's color. All pixels strictly inside the bounding box (excluding the border itself) should be set to this color, overwriting any white pixels or the original marker pixel.
    *   If multiple rectangles or markers exist per rectangle, or if the conditions aren't met (e.g., no marker inside), the behavior is undefined by the examples, but the simplest approach is to leave the grid unchanged or process only those that fit the criteria. (Based on the examples, we assume a single valid rectangle-marker pair exists).
5.  **Return Output:** Return the modified grid.
