            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and refine our understanding of the transformation.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code attempt failed due to a syntax error (`unexpected indent`). This prevents us from evaluating its logical correctness against the examples. However, the core logic described (\"Identify hollow rectangles, find a single marker inside, fill the interior with the marker's color, remove the marker\") was based on only the first example.\n\nTo create a robust solution, we must analyze *all* training examples to confirm or refine this hypothesis. We need to examine the types of shapes present, their properties (like being hollow or solid), the nature of \"markers\" (are they always single pixels?), their position relative to other shapes, and the exact outcome of the transformation in each case. We will pay close attention to variations between examples that might challenge the initial assumptions.\n\nOur strategy is:\n1.  Correct the syntax error conceptually (assuming it's a simple indentation issue).\n2.  Analyze each input/output pair systematically using code execution to gather precise data.\n3.  Identify common patterns and rules across all examples.\n4.  Document these findings in a structured YAML format.\n5.  Formulate a revised, comprehensive natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's examine each training example pair provided in the task setup.\n\n**Example 1 (Train Pair 0):**\n\n*Input:*\n"

This includes the original location of the marker.\n- The initial assumption that the marker pixel is removed (set to white) was incorrect; its location is overwritten by the fill color (which is its own color, so the effect is simply being part of the fill).\n- All examples show exactly one hollow rectangle and exactly one single-pixel marker inside it. The code should handle cases where these conditions aren't met (e.g., no marker, multiple markers, marker outside, no rectangle), although the examples don't test these scenarios. Based on the examples, we assume these conditions are met.\n- The interior of the rectangle in the input is primarily white (0), except for the single marker pixel. The transformation fills *all* interior cells, regardless of their initial color (white or marker color).\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"
