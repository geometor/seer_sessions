*   **Perception:** The input grids contain multiple distinct objects. Some objects are hollow rectangles defined by a single border color. Other objects are single pixels of various colors, acting as "markers" or "fill colors". The transformation involves filling the interior (the white space enclosed by the border) of each hollow rectangle with the color of a specific marker pixel found *inside* that rectangle's bounds in the input. All marker pixels are removed in the output grid, whether they were used for filling or not. The hollow rectangles themselves remain in their original positions, but their interiors change from white to the fill color.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - description: Hollow Rectangular Objects
        properties:
          - color: Various (Red, Green, Azure, Yellow, Blue)
          - shape: Hollow Rectangle (a border of a single color enclosing white pixels)
          - role: Container
      - description: Marker Pixels
        properties:
          - color: Various (Azure, Yellow, Green, Magenta, Red)
          - shape: Single Pixel
          - location: Some are located within the boundaries (interior) of the hollow rectangles, others are outside.
          - role: Fill Color Identifier
    actions:
      - name: Identify Hollow Rectangles
        input: Input Grid
        output: List of hollow rectangles (identified by border color and coordinates)
      - name: Identify Marker Pixels
        input: Input Grid
        output: List of marker pixels (identified by color and coordinates)
      - name: Associate Marker with Rectangle
        input: Hollow Rectangle, List of Marker Pixels
        condition: A marker pixel's coordinates fall strictly within the bounds of the hollow rectangle's interior (excluding the border).
        output: The color of the associated marker pixel.
      - name: Fill Rectangle Interior
        input: Hollow Rectangle, Associated Marker Color
        process: Change the color of all white pixels within the rectangle's interior to the marker color.
        output: Modified Grid Segment
      - name: Remove All Markers
        input: Grid (potentially after filling)
        process: Change the color of all cells that originally contained a marker pixel to white (0).
        output: Final Grid
    relationships:
      - type: Spatial Containment
        entity1: Marker Pixel
        entity2: Hollow Rectangle
        condition: The marker pixel is located within the interior area defined by the rectangle's border. This relationship determines the fill color for the rectangle.
    outcome:
      - The output grid contains the original hollow rectangles, but their interiors are filled with the color of the marker pixel that was spatially contained within them in the input grid.
      - All original marker pixels are removed (set to white) in the output grid.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all distinct hollow rectangular objects in the input grid. A hollow rectangle is defined by a contiguous border of a single non-white color enclosing a region of white pixels.
    2.  Identify all single, isolated non-white pixels (marker pixels) in the input grid.
    3.  For each hollow rectangle identified in step 1:
        a.  Search the input grid for any marker pixel (identified in step 2) located strictly *inside* the bounds of the rectangle's interior (i.e., within the enclosed white space, not on the border).
        b.  If exactly one such marker pixel is found inside a rectangle, determine its color. This color becomes the "fill color" for that specific rectangle.
    4.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
    5.  For each hollow rectangle that had an associated fill color determined in step 3b:
        a.  Fill the interior white space of that rectangle in the output grid with its corresponding fill color.
    6.  Set the color of all locations in the output grid that corresponded to *any* marker pixel (identified in step 2) in the input grid to white (0), regardless of whether they were used for filling or not.
