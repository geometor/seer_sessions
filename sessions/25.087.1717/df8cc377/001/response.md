"""
Identify hollow rectangular objects and single marker pixels in the input grid.
For each hollow rectangle, find if there is exactly one marker pixel located 
strictly within its interior boundaries.
If such a marker pixel exists, fill the interior of that rectangle (originally 
white pixels) with the color of the marker pixel.
Finally, remove all original marker pixels from the grid by setting their 
locations to white (0).
