"""
Identify all hollow rectangular border objects in the input grid. For each 
rectangle, find any single marker pixel object located strictly within that 
rectangle's interior boundaries. If such a marker is found for a rectangle, 
fill the entire interior area defined by that rectangle's bounding box 
(excluding the border pixels) with the color of the marker pixel. Finally, 
remove all single-pixel objects (markers) from the grid, regardless of 
whether they were inside a rectangle or not. The rectangle borders themselves 
and pixels outside any identified rectangle remain unchanged (unless they were 
markers). If multiple rectangle-marker pairs exist, apply the transformation 
to all of them independently.
