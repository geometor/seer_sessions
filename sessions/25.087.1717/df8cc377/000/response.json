Other objects are single pixels of various colors, acting as \"markers\" or \"fill colors\". The transformation involves filling the interior (the white space enclosed by the border) of each hollow rectangle with the color of a specific marker pixel found *inside* that rectangle's bounds in the input. All marker pixels are removed in the output grid, whether they were used for filling or not. The hollow rectangles themselves remain in their original positions, but their interiors change from white to the fill color.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
