            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the examples provided.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grid always contains a single 2x2 block of non-white pixels, typically located near the bottom-left corner, against a white background.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. It retains the original 2x2 block in its original position. Additionally, several new rectangular blocks appear in the output.\n3.  **Color Relationship:** The colors of the new blocks in the output are determined solely by the colors present in the original 2x2 input block.\n4.  **Positional Relationship:** The new blocks in the output are positioned relative to the original 2x2 input block. Their placement follows specific offset rules.\n5.  **Block Generation Rules:** There seem to be multiple \"generations\" or types of blocks created based on the input 2x2 pattern.\n    *   **Generation 1 (Scaled):** A 4x4 block is created by scaling each pixel of the input 2x2 block into a 2x2 area of the same color. This block is placed slightly above and to the right of the original block.\n    *   **Generation 2 (Columnar, Size 4):** Two 8x4 blocks are generated. The first uses the colors from the first column of the input 2x2 block (top 4x4 block has the top-left color, bottom 4x4 block has the bottom-left color). The second uses the colors from the second column similarly. These blocks are placed further above and to the right.\n    *   **Generation 3 (Columnar, Size 8):** Two 16x8 blocks are generated, again based on the columns of the input 2x2 block (top 8x8 block has the top color, bottom 8x8 block has the bottom color). These are placed even further above and to the right.\n6.  **Boundary Condition:** Not all potential blocks appear in every example. It seems a generated block is only drawn if it fits entirely within the bounds of the output grid. Example 3, with a larger grid, shows more generated blocks than Examples 1 and 2.\n7.  **Preservation:** The original 2x2 block from the input is always present in the output at its original location.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"

Note its top-left row `r` and column `c`, and the colors of its pixels: `c1` (top-left), `c2` (top-right), `c3` (bottom-left), `c4` (bottom-right).\n2.  Create an output grid of the same height and width as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color white (0).\n3.  Copy the original 2x2 block (`[[c1, c2], [c3, c4]]`) onto the output grid at the location `(r, c)`.\n4.  Define a list of block generation rules. Each rule specifies the size, top-left starting coordinates (relative to `(r, c)`), and the color or pattern for the block(s) it generates:\n    *   **Rule 1 (Scaled):** Generate a 4x4 block starting at `(r-1, c+2)`. Fill it according to the pattern `[[c1, c1, c2, c2], [c1, c1, c2, c2], [c3, c3, c4, c4], [c3, c3, c4, c4]]`.\n    *   **Rule 2 (Col 1, Size 4):** Generate a 4x4 block of color `c1` starting at `(r-3, c+6)` and a 4x4 block of color `c3` starting at `(r+1, c+6)`.\n    *   **Rule 3 (Col 2, Size 4):** Generate a 4x4 block of color `c2` starting at `(r-3, c+10)` and a 4x4 block of color `c4` starting at `(r+1, c+10)`.\n    *   **Rule 4 (Col 1, Size 8):** Generate an 8x8 block of color `c1` starting at `(r-7, c+14)` and an 8x8 block of color `c3` starting at `(r+1, c+14)`.\n    *   **Rule 5 (Col 2, Size 8):** Generate an 8x8 block of color `c2` starting at `(r-7, c+22)` and an 8x8 block of color `c4` starting at `(r+1, c+22)`.\n5.  Iterate through each defined block (including the sub-blocks in Rules 2-5). For each block:\n    *   Calculate its absolute row and column boundaries (top row, bottom row, left col, right col).\n    *   Check if `top_row >= 0`, `bottom_row < grid_height`, `left_col >= 0`, and `right_col < grid_width`.\n    *   If all boundary conditions are met, draw the block onto the output grid with its specified color or pattern.\n6.  The final state of the output grid is the result."
