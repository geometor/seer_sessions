task_description: Generate multiple colored rectangular blocks based on a 2x2 pattern block found in the input.

elements:
  - object: grid
    type: input
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains:
          - object: pattern_block
            shape: 2x2
            pixels: non-white colors
            count: 1
            location: variable, often near bottom-left

  - object: grid
    type: output
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input grid
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains:
          - object: pattern_block (copied from input)
            location: same as in input
          - object: generated_blocks
            count: variable (up to 5 observed types)
            derivation: based on pattern_block colors and location
            placement: relative offsets from pattern_block location
            condition: must fit entirely within grid boundaries

pattern_block_details:
  - notation: [[c1, c2], [c3, c4]] at (r, c) # c1=top-left, c2=top-right, c3=bottom-left, c4=bottom-right

generated_block_definitions:
  - type: scaled_2x2
    size: 4x4
    location: (r-1, c+2)
    pattern: [[c1, c1, c2, c2], [c1, c1, c2, c2], [c3, c3, c4, c4], [c3, c3, c4, c4]]
  - type: column_1_size_4
    size: 8x4 total (two 4x4 sub-blocks)
    location_top: (r-3, c+6)
    location_bottom: (r+1, c+6)
    color_top: c1
    color_bottom: c3
  - type: column_2_size_4
    size: 8x4 total (two 4x4 sub-blocks)
    location_top: (r-3, c+10)
    location_bottom: (r+1, c+10)
    color_top: c2
    color_bottom: c4
  - type: column_1_size_8
    size: 16x8 total (two 8x8 sub-blocks)
    location_top: (r-7, c+14)
    location_bottom: (r+1, c+14)
    color_top: c1
    color_bottom: c3
  - type: column_2_size_8
    size: 16x8 total (two 8x8 sub-blocks)
    location_top: (r-7, c+22)
    location_bottom: (r+1, c+22)
    color_top: c2
    color_bottom: c4

actions:
  - Find the unique 2x2 non-white pattern_block in the input grid. Record its top-left coordinates (r, c) and its colors [[c1, c2], [c3, c4]].
  - Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized to white (0).
  - Copy the found 2x2 pattern_block from the input to the output grid at the same location (r, c).
  - Define the five potential generated block types (scaled_2x2, column_1_size_4, etc.) with their respective sizes, relative locations, and color patterns based on c1, c2, c3, c4, r, and c.
  - For each potential generated block (or sub-block for columnar types):
    - Calculate its absolute coordinates and required dimensions.
    - Check if the entire block fits within the output grid boundaries (0 <= row < height, 0 <= col < width).
    - If the block fits, draw it onto the output grid using its specified color(s).
