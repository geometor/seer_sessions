We can consider contiguous regions of '8's as single objects.\n\n2.  **Detect the change:** The change occur at the edge between 8 and 0.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation appears on two locations:\n    *   The last pixel of the first object '8', change to 1.\n    *   The first pixel of the last object '8', change to 1.\n\nIn summary, the rule highlights the changes on certain pixels equal to '8' by changing their value to '1'.\n"
