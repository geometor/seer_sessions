--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, let's analyze the transformation from `example_1_input` to `example_1_output`.

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed changes, focusing on objects, properties, and actions:

**Natural Language Program (NLP):**

1.  **Identify Objects and Properties:** The primary objects in the input grid are squares (or pixels) with the color value '8' (likely representing a specific color, e.g., blue). We can consider contiguous regions of '8's as single objects.

2.  **Detect the change:** The change occur at the edge between 8 and 0.

3.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation appears on two locations:
    *   The last pixel of the first object '8', change to 1.
    *   The first pixel of the last object '8', change to 1.

In summary, the rule highlights the changes on certain pixels equal to '8' by changing their value to '1'.


```
example_1_input = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
]

example_1_output = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
]
```

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Skeleton Template**

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ allowed imports that support the transform }}

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':
    input = [
        {{ Input grid rows }}
    ]

    expected_output = [
        {{ expected output grid rows }}
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("[bold green]SUCCESS![/]")
    else:
        print("[bold red]FAILED![/]")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
