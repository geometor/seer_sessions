The grids consist of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The core task seems to be *counting* something within the input grid. The specific thing being counted appears to relate to the arrangement and/or color of non-zero pixels. It is not simply the total number of non-zero pixels, as evidenced by train_1, train_2, and train_3. The presence of 0s (white pixels) seems to be a key structural element, possibly acting as separators or defining regions. The output is likely the count of connected non-zero regions.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Note: the examples do not show diagonal connections so let's assume only horizontal and vertical connectivity.\n3. **Count Regions:**  Increment a counter for each distinct region found.\n4. **Output:** The final output is the total count of distinct regions.\n\nIn essence, the program counts the number of \"islands\" of identically colored, orthogonally connected pixels within the grid. Zero-valued pixels act as boundaries between these islands.\n"
