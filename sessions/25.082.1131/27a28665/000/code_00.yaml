facts:
  - observation: Input is a 2D grid of single-digit integers (0-9).
  - observation: Output is a single integer.
  - observation: Non-zero values in the input grid likely represent colored pixels.
  - observation: '0' values (white) seem to act as separators.
  - observation: The output integers are small, suggesting a counting process.
  - hypothesis:  The task involves counting distinct regions of non-zero colored pixels.
  - hypothesis:  Adjacent (horizontally and vertically, perhaps diagonally) non-zero pixels of the *same* color form a single region.
  - hypothesis: Adjacent non-zero pixels of *different* colors form different regions, even if the pixels are adjacent.
