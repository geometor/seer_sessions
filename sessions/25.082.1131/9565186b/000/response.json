The input and output grids have the same dimensions in all provided examples. The transformation seems to focus on specific color changes within the grid, particularly targeting colors other than the most prevalent one in the top row. The color `5` (gray) consistently appears in the output where non-prevalent colors in the top row were in the input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
