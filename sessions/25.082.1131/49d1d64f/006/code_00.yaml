objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - rows: variable
      - cols: variable
      - values: integers (0-9)

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - rows: 2 * input_grid.rows
      - cols: 2 * input_grid.cols
      - values: integers (0-9)
    derivation:
      - action: duplicate_pixels
        description: Each pixel in input_grid is duplicated horizontally and vertically.
      - action: add_border
        description: A border of zeros is added around the duplicated grid, specifically along the top and bottom.

actions:
  - name: duplicate_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: intermediate_grid
    transformation: |
       Each pixel (x, y) in the input grid becomes a 2x2 block:
       (x, y), (x+1, y), (x, y+1), (x+1, y+1) in the intermediate grid.

  - name: add_border
    input: intermediate_grid
    output: output_grid
    transformation: |
      A row of zeros is added to the very top of the output grid
      and bottom of the grid.
