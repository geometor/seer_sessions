Okay, let's analyze the second example provided.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6,3)]
      shape: "Three separate azure 'L' shapes, each composed of three cells."

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6,3)]
      shape: "Three separate azure 'L' shapes, similar to input."
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: "Three blue single cells inside L shape's corners."
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains three distinct "L"-shaped objects made of azure (color 8) cells. Each "L" shape consists of three contiguous cells.

2.  **Locate Corners:** For each azure "L" shape, determine its inner corner.

3.  **Introduce Blue Cells:** Place a blue cell (color 1) inside the corner of each of the three "L" shapes.

4.  **Preserve Other Cells:** All other cells in the grid remain unchanged (color 0, white).

**In summary**: The transformation identifies each of the L-shaped patterns and inserts a blue cell inside the corner. The rest of the input elements are unchanged. This description matches the one of the first examples.
