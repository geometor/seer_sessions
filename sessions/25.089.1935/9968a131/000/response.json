            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples maintain their original grid dimensions in the output. The transformation operates row by row independently.\n2.  **Row Patterns:** The input grids exhibit repeating or alternating row patterns.\n    *   Example 1 Input: Two distinct row patterns alternate: `(7, 3, 8, 7)` and `(7, 8, 3, 7)`.\n    *   Example 2 Input: Two distinct row patterns alternate: `(0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7)` and `(5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7)`.\n3.  **Selective Modification:** Not all rows are changed. Only rows matching the *second* distinct pattern encountered (reading from top to bottom) are modified.\n    *   Example 1: Rows `(7, 8, 3, 7)` are modified.\n    *   Example 2: Rows `(5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7)` are modified.\n4.  **Transformation Type:** The modification involves a rearrangement of pixels within the affected rows. Specifically, a 3-pixel sequence within these rows undergoes a cyclic shift to the right.\n5.  **Identifying the Sequence:** The specific 3-pixel sequence to be shifted seems determined by comparing the first two distinct row patterns found in the input.\n    *   Example 1: Patterns `(7, 3, 8, 7)` and `(7, 8, 3, 7)` first differ at index 1. The sequence from the second pattern starting at index 1 is `(8, 3, 7)`. This is the sequence that gets shifted.\n    *   Example 2: Patterns `(0, 5, 7, ...)` and `(5, 0, 7, ...)` first differ at index 0. The sequence from the second pattern starting at index 0 is `(5, 0, 7)`. This is the sequence that gets shifted.\n6.  **Applying the Shift:** The identified 3-pixel sequence (e.g., `A, B, C`) is replaced by its right cyclic shift (`C, A, B`) *only* in the rows that match the second distinct pattern, and *only* at the specific starting index derived from the pattern comparison.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

T = (P2[i], P2[i+1], P2[i+2]).\n\nTransformation:\n  - Condition: The input grid must contain at least two distinct row patterns. If only one pattern exists, no transformation occurs.\n  - Action: Cyclic Right Shift\n    Target: The 3-pixel Target Sequence (T) identified above.\n    Operation: Replace T = (c1, c2, c3) with Shifted_T = (c3, c1, c2).\n  - Application:\n    Scope: Applied row by row to the input grid.\n    Trigger: A row R is modified if and only if the sequence of pixels in R starting at the Difference Index 'i' matches the Target Sequence T.\n    Result: In triggered rows, the pixels at indices i, i+1, i+2 are replaced by the Shifted_T sequence. Non-triggered rows remain unchanged.\n\nRelationships:\n  - Output grid depends entirely on the Input grid.\n  - The transformation rule is derived from comparing the first two unique row patterns within the Input grid.\n  - The modification applies only to rows matching the second unique pattern and specifically targets the sequence starting where the patterns first diverged.\n```"
