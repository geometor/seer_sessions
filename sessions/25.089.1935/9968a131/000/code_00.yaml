Data:
  - Grid_Type: Input
    Grid_Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 4x4, 6x6)
    Content: Rows of pixels (colors 0-9)
    Structure: Often contains repeating or alternating row patterns.
  - Grid_Type: Output
    Grid_Dimensions: Same as corresponding Input
    Content: Rows of pixels (colors 0-9)
    Structure: Derived from Input grid by selective row modification.

Identification:
  - Element: Unique Row Patterns
    Method: Scan input grid rows top-to-bottom, identify distinct sequences of pixel values. Store the first two unique patterns found (P1, P2).
  - Element: Difference Index (i)
    Method: Compare P1 and P2 element by element from left (index 0) to find the first index 'i' where they differ.
  - Element: Target Sequence (T)
    Method: Extract the 3-pixel sequence from P2 starting at index 'i'. T = (P2[i], P2[i+1], P2[i+2]).

Transformation:
  - Condition: The input grid must contain at least two distinct row patterns. If only one pattern exists, no transformation occurs.
  - Action: Cyclic Right Shift
    Target: The 3-pixel Target Sequence (T) identified above.
    Operation: Replace T = (c1, c2, c3) with Shifted_T = (c3, c1, c2).
  - Application:
    Scope: Applied row by row to the input grid.
    Trigger: A row R is modified if and only if the sequence of pixels in R starting at the Difference Index 'i' matches the Target Sequence T.
    Result: In triggered rows, the pixels at indices i, i+1, i+2 are replaced by the Shifted_T sequence. Non-triggered rows remain unchanged.

Relationships:
  - Output grid depends entirely on the Input grid.
  - The transformation rule is derived from comparing the first two unique row patterns within the Input grid.
  - The modification applies only to rows matching the second unique pattern and specifically targets the sequence starting where the patterns first diverged.
