Stores the first unique pattern (P1) and the second unique pattern (P2).\n3. If only one unique pattern exists, returns a copy of the input grid.\n4. If two or more unique patterns exist:\n   a. Finds the first column index 'i' where P1 and P2 differ.\n   b. Defines a 3-pixel \"target sequence\" T starting at index 'i' in P2.\n   c. Calculates a \"shifted sequence\" S by cyclically shifting T one position right.\n   d. Iterates through each row R of the input grid:\n      i. Checks if the 3-pixel sequence in R starting at index 'i' matches T.\n      ii. If it matches, replaces that sequence in the output row with S.\n      iii. Otherwise, keeps the row unchanged.\n5.
