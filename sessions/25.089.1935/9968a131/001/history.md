Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples maintain their original grid dimensions in the output. The transformation operates row by row independently.
2.  **Row Patterns:** The input grids exhibit repeating or alternating row patterns.
    *   Example 1 Input: Two distinct row patterns alternate: `(7, 3, 8, 7)` and `(7, 8, 3, 7)`.
    *   Example 2 Input: Two distinct row patterns alternate: `(0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7)` and `(5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7)`.
3.  **Selective Modification:** Not all rows are changed. Only rows matching the *second* distinct pattern encountered (reading from top to bottom) are modified.
    *   Example 1: Rows `(7, 8, 3, 7)` are modified.
    *   Example 2: Rows `(5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7)` are modified.
4.  **Transformation Type:** The modification involves a rearrangement of pixels within the affected rows. Specifically, a 3-pixel sequence within these rows undergoes a cyclic shift to the right.
5.  **Identifying the Sequence:** The specific 3-pixel sequence to be shifted seems determined by comparing the first two distinct row patterns found in the input.
    *   Example 1: Patterns `(7, 3, 8, 7)` and `(7, 8, 3, 7)` first differ at index 1. The sequence from the second pattern starting at index 1 is `(8, 3, 7)`. This is the sequence that gets shifted.
    *   Example 2: Patterns `(0, 5, 7, ...)` and `(5, 0, 7, ...)` first differ at index 0. The sequence from the second pattern starting at index 0 is `(5, 0, 7)`. This is the sequence that gets shifted.
6.  **Applying the Shift:** The identified 3-pixel sequence (e.g., `A, B, C`) is replaced by its right cyclic shift (`C, A, B`) *only* in the rows that match the second distinct pattern, and *only* at the specific starting index derived from the pattern comparison.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  - Grid_Type: Input
    Grid_Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 4x4, 6x6)
    Content: Rows of pixels (colors 0-9)
    Structure: Often contains repeating or alternating row patterns.
  - Grid_Type: Output
    Grid_Dimensions: Same as corresponding Input
    Content: Rows of pixels (colors 0-9)
    Structure: Derived from Input grid by selective row modification.

Identification:
  - Element: Unique Row Patterns
    Method: Scan input grid rows top-to-bottom, identify distinct sequences of pixel values. Store the first two unique patterns found (P1, P2).
  - Element: Difference Index (i)
    Method: Compare P1 and P2 element by element from left (index 0) to find the first index 'i' where they differ.
  - Element: Target Sequence (T)
    Method: Extract the 3-pixel sequence from P2 starting at index 'i'. T = (P2[i], P2[i+1], P2[i+2]).

Transformation:
  - Condition: The input grid must contain at least two distinct row patterns. If only one pattern exists, no transformation occurs.
  - Action: Cyclic Right Shift
    Target: The 3-pixel Target Sequence (T) identified above.
    Operation: Replace T = (c1, c2, c3) with Shifted_T = (c3, c1, c2).
  - Application:
    Scope: Applied row by row to the input grid.
    Trigger: A row R is modified if and only if the sequence of pixels in R starting at the Difference Index 'i' matches the Target Sequence T.
    Result: In triggered rows, the pixels at indices i, i+1, i+2 are replaced by the Shifted_T sequence. Non-triggered rows remain unchanged.

Relationships:
  - Output grid depends entirely on the Input grid.
  - The transformation rule is derived from comparing the first two unique row patterns within the Input grid.
  - The modification applies only to rows matching the second unique pattern and specifically targets the sequence starting where the patterns first diverged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input grid row by row from top to bottom.
2.  Identify the sequence of unique row patterns encountered. Store the first unique pattern as `P1` and the second unique pattern (if it exists) as `P2`.
3.  If only one unique row pattern exists (`P2` is not found), copy the input grid directly to the output grid.
4.  If two or more unique patterns exist, find the first column index `i` where `P1` and `P2` have different pixel values.
5.  Define the "target sequence" `T` as the three pixels in `P2` starting at index `i` (i.e., `P2[i]`, `P2[i+1]`, `P2[i+2]`).
6.  Calculate the "shifted sequence" `S` by cyclically shifting `T` one position to the right (i.e., `S = (T[2], T[0], T[1])`).
7.  Create the output grid by processing each row `R` from the input grid:
    a.  Check if the sequence of three pixels in row `R` starting at index `i` is identical to the target sequence `T`.
    b.  If it matches, replace the pixels in row `R` at indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2` with the shifted sequence `S`.
    c.  If it does not match, keep row `R` unchanged in the output grid.
8.  Return the fully processed output grid.
