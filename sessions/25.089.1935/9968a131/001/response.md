"""
Processes an input grid based on row patterns.

1. Identifies unique row patterns in the input grid from top to bottom.
2. Stores the first unique pattern (P1) and the second unique pattern (P2).
3. If only one unique pattern exists, returns a copy of the input grid.
4. If two or more unique patterns exist:
   a. Finds the first column index 'i' where P1 and P2 differ.
   b. Defines a 3-pixel "target sequence" T starting at index 'i' in P2.
   c. Calculates a "shifted sequence" S by cyclically shifting T one position right.
   d. Iterates through each row R of the input grid:
      i. Checks if the 3-pixel sequence in R starting at index 'i' matches T.
      ii. If it matches, replaces that sequence in the output row with S.
      iii. Otherwise, keeps the row unchanged.
5. Returns the resulting modified grid.
