task_elements:
  - item: Grids
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - dimensions: variable (up to 30x30)
      - colors_used_input: [white(0), blue(1), red(2), gray(5), magenta(6), azure(8)]
      - colors_used_output: [blue(1), red(2), gray(5), azure(8)]
  - item: Pixels
    properties:
      - type: individual cell in the grid
      - value: integer 0-9 representing a color
  - item: Background Color (White, 0)
    properties:
      - special role: seems to indicate locations of interest or missing information
      - spatial_arrangement: forms the shape/dimensions of the output grid (single pixel in ex1, 2x2 block in ex2 & ex3)
  - item: Non-Background Colors
    properties:
      - form patterns: checkerboards, repeating rows/columns, block patterns
      - pattern_continuity: the pattern generally extends across the grid but is interrupted by the background color pixels

actions:
  - action: Identify Pattern
    actor: system
    input: non-background pixels of the input grid
    output: description of the repeating or predictable pattern
    purpose: determine the expected color at any given coordinate
  - action: Locate Background Pixels
    actor: system
    input: input grid
    output: list of coordinates containing the background color (white, 0)
    purpose: define the locations for pattern reconstruction and the shape of the output
  - action: Infer Missing Colors
    actor: system
    input: 
      - pattern description
      - coordinates of background pixels
    output: list of colors corresponding to the pattern's prediction at each background pixel coordinate
    purpose: fill in the missing parts of the pattern
  - action: Construct Output Grid
    actor: system
    input:
      - inferred colors
      - relative spatial arrangement of background pixels
    output: final output grid
    purpose: assemble the result based on the inferred colors and their original positions relative to each other

relationships:
  - relationship: correspondence
    between: spatial arrangement of background pixels in input
    and: shape and size of the output grid
  - relationship: prediction
    between: identified pattern in non-background pixels
    and: color values placed in the output grid
