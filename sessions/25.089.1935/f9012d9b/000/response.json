            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The output grid is generally smaller than the input grid.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The examples use white (0), blue (1), red (2), gray (5), magenta (6), and azure (8). White (0) appears to play a special role.\n3.  **Example 1:** The input is a 4x4 grid, mostly a checkerboard of azure (8) and magenta (6), but with one white (0) pixel replacing an expected azure (8). The output is a single azure (8) pixel.\n4.  **Example 2:** The input is a 5x5 grid with patterns of red (2) and blue (1). The bottom-left 2x2 corner consists of white (0) pixels. The output is a 2x2 grid `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`.\n5.  **Example 3:** The input is a 7x7 grid with patterns of red (2) and gray (5). The bottom-right 2x2 corner consists of white (0) pixels. The output is a 2x2 grid `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`.\n6.  **Core Observation:** In all examples, the white (0) pixels in the input seem to mark locations where the underlying pattern is \"missing\" or interrupted. The output grid appears to reconstruct the pattern values that *should* have been at the locations of the white pixels. The shape and size of the output grid correspond to the shape formed by the white pixels in the input.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Determine the relative spatial arrangement of these background pixels (e.g., are they adjacent, forming a block? Or isolated?). This arrangement defines the shape and size of the output grid.\n3.  Analyze the pattern formed by the non-background pixels surrounding the background pixel(s). Identify the rule governing the pattern (e.g., alternating colors, repeating rows/columns, repeating blocks).\n4.  For each background pixel identified in step 1, use the pattern rule identified in step 3 to determine the color that *should* appear at that specific coordinate if the pattern were complete.\n5.  Construct the output grid. The size and shape are determined in step 2. Fill the cells of the output grid with the colors predicted in step 4, maintaining the same relative spatial positions as the original background pixels."
