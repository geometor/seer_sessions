Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The output grid is generally smaller than the input grid.
2.  **Color Palette:** The examples use white (0), blue (1), red (2), gray (5), magenta (6), and azure (8). White (0) appears to play a special role.
3.  **Example 1:** The input is a 4x4 grid, mostly a checkerboard of azure (8) and magenta (6), but with one white (0) pixel replacing an expected azure (8). The output is a single azure (8) pixel.
4.  **Example 2:** The input is a 5x5 grid with patterns of red (2) and blue (1). The bottom-left 2x2 corner consists of white (0) pixels. The output is a 2x2 grid `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`.
5.  **Example 3:** The input is a 7x7 grid with patterns of red (2) and gray (5). The bottom-right 2x2 corner consists of white (0) pixels. The output is a 2x2 grid `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`.
6.  **Core Observation:** In all examples, the white (0) pixels in the input seem to mark locations where the underlying pattern is "missing" or interrupted. The output grid appears to reconstruct the pattern values that *should* have been at the locations of the white pixels. The shape and size of the output grid correspond to the shape formed by the white pixels in the input.

task_elements:
  - item: Grids
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - dimensions: variable (up to 30x30)

      - colors_used_output: [blue(1), red(2), gray(5), azure(8)]
  - item: Pixels
    properties:
      - type: individual cell in the grid
      - value: integer 0-9 representing a color
  - item: Background Color (White, 0)
    properties:
      - special role: seems to indicate locations of interest or missing information
      - spatial_arrangement: forms the shape/dimensions of the output grid (single pixel in ex1, 2x2 block in ex2 & ex3)
  - item: Non-Background Colors
    properties:
      - form patterns: checkerboards, repeating rows/columns, block patterns
      - pattern_continuity: the pattern generally extends across the grid but is interrupted by the background color pixels

actions:
  - action: Identify Pattern
    actor: system
    input: non-background pixels of the input grid
    output: description of the repeating or predictable pattern
    purpose: determine the expected color at any given coordinate
  - action: Locate Background Pixels
    actor: system
    input: input grid
    output: list of coordinates containing the background color (white, 0)
    purpose: define the locations for pattern reconstruction and the shape of the output
  - action: Infer Missing Colors
    actor: system
    input: 
      - pattern description
      - coordinates of background pixels
    output: list of colors corresponding to the pattern's prediction at each background pixel coordinate
    purpose: fill in the missing parts of the pattern
  - action: Construct Output Grid
    actor: system
    input:
      - inferred colors
      - relative spatial arrangement of background pixels
    output: final output grid
    purpose: assemble the result based on the inferred colors and their original positions relative to each other

relationships:
  - relationship: correspondence
    between: spatial arrangement of background pixels in input
    and: shape and size of the output grid
  - relationship: prediction
    between: identified pattern in non-background pixels
    and: color values placed in the output grid
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the background color (white, 0). Note their coordinates.
2.  Determine the relative spatial arrangement of these background pixels (e.g., are they adjacent, forming a block? Or isolated?). This arrangement defines the shape and size of the output grid.
3.  Analyze the pattern formed by the non-background pixels surrounding the background pixel(s). Identify the rule governing the pattern (e.g., alternating colors, repeating rows/columns, repeating blocks).
4.  For each background pixel identified in step 1, use the pattern rule identified in step 3 to determine the color that *should* appear at that specific coordinate if the pattern were complete.
5.  Construct the output grid. The size and shape are determined in step 2. Fill the cells of the output grid with the colors predicted in step 4, maintaining the same relative spatial positions as the original background pixels.
