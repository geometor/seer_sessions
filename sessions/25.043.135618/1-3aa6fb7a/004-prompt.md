**NLP:**
['Okay, let\'s analyze the transformation from `example_2_input` to `example_2_output`.\n\n1.  **Identify Objects and Properties:** The input grid consists of 0s and 8s. The 8s form connected objects.\n\n2.  **Observe the Change:**  Some \'8\' values have been replaced by \'1\'s. There appear to be three connected components of \'8\'.  The top rightmost \'8\' in the top right component has been replaced by a \'1\'. The rightmost 8 of the top row of the component on the top left has been changed to 1. In the bottom component, the leftmost \'8\' in the top row of the component has been changed to a \'1\'.\n\n3.  **Describe the Rule:** The rule appears to be to identify all connected components of 8s, and transform a specific 8 within each component to a 1. We determine which component by its approximate location:\n    - top right component: change the rightmost element of the top row to 1\n    - top left component: change the rightmost element of the top row to 1\n    - bottom component: change the leftmost element of the top row to 1\n\n**Natural Language Program (NLP):**\n\nLocate all connected components of \'8\'s. For each component, identify its approximate location as "top right", "top left" or "bottom".\n- For the "top right" component, change the rightmost element of the top row from \'8\' to \'1\'.\n- For the "top left" component, change the rightmost element of the top row from \'8\' to \'1\'.\n- For the "bottom" component, change the leftmost element of the top row from \'8\' to \'1\'.\n\n']

================================================================================
**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Skeleton Template**

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ allowed imports that support the transform }}

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':
    input = [
        {{ Input grid rows }}
    ]

    expected_output = [
        {{ expected output grid rows }}
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("[bold green]SUCCESS![/]")
    else:
        print("[bold red]FAILED![/]")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
