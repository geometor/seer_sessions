Okay, let's analyze the transformation from `example_1_input` to `example_1_output`.

Here's a step-by-step natural language description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects and Properties:** The input grid consists of 0s and 8s. We can consider the 8s as forming objects.

2.  **Observe the Change:** Comparing the input and output, we see that some of the '8' values have been replaced by '1's. Specifically the top right 8 in the connected set on top left and the bottom left 8 in the connected set on bottom right corner were converted to 1.

3.  **Describe the Rule:** The transformation rule appears to the number on the top right, when considering the group on the top left is changed from '8' to '1', and that the number on the bottom left, when considering the group on the bottom right, is changed from an '8' to a '1'.

**Natural Language Program (NLP):**

Locate all connected components of '8's. For the set of 8s on the top left, change the rightmost element of the top row from 8 to 1. For the set of 8s on the bottom right, change the leftmost element of the bottom row from 8 to 1.
