            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was a good start, focusing on identifying azure clusters and modifying a specific pixel within each. However, it's clear from the test results that the logic for selecting the \"target pixel\" within each cluster is incorrect. The code aims for the left-most pixel in the vertical middle, but the examples show a more nuanced rule is at play. It appears the *entire* vertical line containing the left-most pixel of the vertical center should turn blue, not just one pixel.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Target Pixel Identification:** Instead of changing only the `leftmost_pixel`, we need to change all pixels in the column of the `leftmost_pixel` that are part of the vertical extent of the azure cluster.\n2.  **Verify with all examples:** Re-run the transformed output with the updated logic.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per example):**\n\nI can see these from the provided examples, so I will put those into the YAML, but if I needed more info I would use code execution to get a more detailed report.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 010\nobjects:\n  - id: azure_cluster\n    color: azure (8)\n    description: A contiguous group of azure pixels.\n    properties:\n        - vertical_extent: The range of rows spanned by the cluster.\n        - leftmost_column: The column index of the leftmost pixel in the cluster's vertical middle.\nactions:\n  - id: change_color\n    target: azure_cluster\n    from_color: azure (8)\n    to_color: blue (1)\n    condition: \"All pixels in leftmost_column that are within that object's vertical extent\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Clusters:** Find all distinct, contiguous groups of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Find Vertical Extent and Leftmost Column:** For each azure cluster:\n    *   Determine the vertical extent (the range of rows the cluster occupies).\n    *   Calculate the vertical middle of the cluster.\n    *   Identify the leftmost pixel within that middle row.\n    *   Note the column index of this leftmost pixel.\n3. **Change color of pixels:** For each azure cluster, find all pixels that reside in that cluster's leftmost\\_column that are within the vertical range of the cluster and change their color to blue (1).\n4.  **Output:** The output grid is a copy of the input grid with the identified pixels changed to blue.\n"
