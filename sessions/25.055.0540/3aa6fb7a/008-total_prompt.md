## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7F9BECA553F0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 8 1 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits, likely representing colors.
*   The dominant colors are white (0) and azure (8).
*   The azure pixels appear to form clusters or objects.
*   Some azure pixels are replaced with blue (1) pixels in the output.
*   The overall shape and position of the azure clusters seem preserved.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  objects:
    - type: pixel_cluster
      color: azure (8)
      shape: irregular
      positions:
        input:  [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5], [2,2], [3,2], [3,3], [5,4], [6,3], [6,4]]
        output: [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5], [2,2], [3,2], [3,3], [5,4], [6,3], [6,4]]
    - type: single_pixel
      color: blue(1)
      positions:
          input: []
          output: [[1,4], [2,3],[5,3]]
  actions:
    - type: replace_color
      target: azure (8)
      replacement: blue (1)
      conditions: "specific azure pixels within clusters"
  relationships:
      - object1: azure_cluster
        object2: blue_pixels
        relation: "blue pixels replace some azure pixels in clusters"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all contiguous clusters of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Locate** specific azure pixels within these, those that are on the "left side" and vertically in the "middle" if that vertical extent is odd, or just below the middle if even.
3. **Change** the color value in those locations from azure (8) to blue (1).
4.  **Preserve** all other pixels as they are.

Essentially the "left most" azure pixel is changed to blue, vertically in a cluster.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
