Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, where each pixel has a color value represented by a digit (0-9). The primary color observed is '0' (white) and '8' (azure). The input grid transforms into an output grid that maintains the same dimensions and most of the pixel values. However, a specific change is noticeable related to the azure pixels.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The input and output grids have the same dimensions (7x7)."
  - objects:
    - type: "pixel"
      properties:
        color: "integer value (0-9)"
        position: "(row, column)"
    - type: "azure_object"
      properties:
        shape: "contiguous block of azure pixels"
        topLeft: "(row, column)"
        bottomRight: "(row, column)"
      relationships:
        - "adjacent_pixels"
    - type: "white_background"
      properties:
        color: "0"
  - actions:
      - type: "check_azure"
        description: "Identify azure (8) colored pixels"
      - type: "replace_pixel_value"
        description: "Certain azure pixels's value has been changed"
        condition: "leftmost in the azure block"
        old_value: 8
        new_value: 1
  - constraints:
      - "Grid dimensions remain constant."
      - "Most pixel values remain unchanged, except for the described replacement."
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels within the input grid. A contiguous block is defined as one or more azure pixels that are directly adjacent to each other (horizontally or vertically).
2.  **Leftmost Check:** Iterate through each identified azure object.
3. **Replace:** In each group of azure, change to blue(1) the leftmost azure pixels.
