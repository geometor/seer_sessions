Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which led to an oversimplified rule. The core issue is that the code identifies the *left-most* pixel in each cluster that is closest to the vertical center. This worked for the first example but failed on the second. The second example reveals that we also need to consider the y-coordinate of the pixel to make sure the correct pixel with the center is chosen. It appears that we should select only the *left-most* azure pixel if there are multiple azure pixels in the middle row of the cluster.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** The code correctly identifies clusters of azure pixels. This part seems robust.
2.  **Improve Target Pixel Selection:** The logic for selecting the "middle" pixel needs to be updated. We need to identify the vertical center more robustly.
3.  **Iterative Testing:** After modifying the code, we'll re-run it against *all* training examples to confirm the fix.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a summary of the examples, including a more precise error analysis using the `code_execution` helper to run some checks.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)
    *   Output Shape: (7, 7)
    *   Mismatched Pixels: 4
    *    Details:
        *   (1,1): expected=8, output=1
        *   (1,2): expected=1, output=0
        *   (4,4): expected=1, output=0
        *   (4,5): expected=8, output=1

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)
    *   Output Shape: (7, 7)
    *   Mismatched Pixels: 6
        * element (0,4): expected=8, output=1
        * element (0,5): expected=1, output=8
        * element (2,2): expected=1, output=8
        * element (2,3): expected=8, output=0
        * element (5,3): expected=8, output=0
        * element (5,4): expected=1, output=8

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_cluster
    type: cluster
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - contiguous: true
      - shape: irregular
      - selected_pixel:
          description: "The azure pixel within the cluster to be changed."
          selection_criteria:
            - vertical_middle: true
            - leftmost: true

actions:
  - name: identify_clusters
    description: "Find all contiguous groups of azure pixels."
  - name: select_pixel
    description: "Select left-most azure pixel in the vertical middle of each cluster."
  - name: change_color
    description: "Change the color of the selected pixel to blue (1)."

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Clusters:** Find all distinct, contiguous clusters of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.  A cluster is a group of adjacent azure pixels (up, down, left, or right – not diagonal).
2.  **Find Vertical Center:** For each azure cluster, determine its vertical center. If cluster has odd number of rows, the vertical center is `(min_row + max_row) / 2`.
3. **Find target Pixel:** For each cluster, identify the left-most azure pixel at the middle vertical position.
4.  **Transform Pixel:** Change the color of the target pixel within each identified cluster from azure (8) to blue (1).
5. **Output:** Create new grid identical to input, except for transformed pixels.
