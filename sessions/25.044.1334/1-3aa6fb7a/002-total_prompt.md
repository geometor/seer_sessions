*text:*
Okay, here's my analysis of the transformation and the natural language program describing it:

**Analysis:**

The primary change between the input and output is the insertion of the digit `1` adjacent to some of the `8`s. Specifically, the `1` appears to be placed to the immediate left or immediate below an `8`, but only if the `8` does not already have adjacent number.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Seeding Object:** Locate all instances of the digit `8` within the input grid.

2.  **Check Left First:** For each `8`, check if the position is not at column 1. If the condition holds, check if the cell immediately to the left is a 0. If it is, replace that `0` with a `1` in the output grid.

3.  **Check the Position Below:** check if the position is not at the maximum row. If the condition holds, check if the cell is available, check the cell immediately below, if there is a '0' at the location, place '1'.

4. **Copy Other 8:** All others 8 were simply kept at the same place.

5.  **Preserve Empty Cells:** All other cells (containing `0`) in the input grid remain unchanged (remain `0`) in the output grid.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again
