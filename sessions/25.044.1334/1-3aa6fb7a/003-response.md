Okay, here's my analysis of the transformation and the natural language program describing it:

**Analysis:**

The transformation rule is consistent with the previous example.  A '1' is placed adjacent to '8's, either to the left or below, but *only* if those adjacent positions are '0's.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify '8's:** Find all cells containing the digit `8` in the input grid.

2.  **Check Left:** For each `8`, check if a '1' can be placed. Check if it is not at the most-left position, and then check if the cell to the immediate left is a `0`. If both are true, place a `1` in the corresponding position in the output grid.

3.  **Check Below:**  For each `8`, Check if it is not at the bottom position, and check the cell immediately below. If that cell contains a `0`, place a `1` in that position in the output grid.

4. **Copy 8's:** All the '8' in input was kept at the same position.

5.  **Preserve '0's:** All cells that were `0` in the input grid remain `0` in the output grid.
