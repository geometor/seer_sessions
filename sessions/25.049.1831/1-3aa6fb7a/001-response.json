One is in the top-left corner consists in a vertical rectangle, and the other is in the center-right and forms an horizontal rectangle.\n\n2.  **Locate Topmost and Leftmost**: For each of the azure objects, find the coordinate that has color 8.\n\n3.  **Change to Blue**: The right adjacent cell to the leftmost azure pixel for the upper object is turned to blue (1), and the down adjacent cell for the leftmost azure pixel is changed to blue (1) for the lower object.\n\n4. **Preserve**: The original azure objects are kept in the ouput.\n\nIn essence, the transformation identifies azure objects, and changes the next cell to its right or down, based on their location, to blue, leaving the remaining parts of the input grid unchanged.\n"
