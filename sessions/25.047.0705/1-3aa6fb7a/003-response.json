The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white), the background.\n\n2.  **Change at Specific Locations:**\n    *   Locate the cell to left of top-most cell of first azure L-shape. Change this cell from color 0 to color 1.\n    *   Locate the cell to the right of the top-most cell of the second azure L-shape. Change this cell from color 0 to color 1.\n\n    *   Locate the cell to the left of the top-most cell of third azure L-shape. Change this cell from color 0 to color 1.\n\n3.  **Preservation:** All other cells in the grid remain unchanged. The two original azure L-shaped objects are preserved.\n\n**Step-by-step transformation summary**\nThe transformation identifies cells that have specific relations to the L-shape objects and changes the color of cells in the described location. The other elements of the grid remain the same. This description is very close with the previous one. The difference is that now we have three L-shapes.\n"
