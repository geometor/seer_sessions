Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[1,2], [4,4]]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure). The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white), which acts as the background.

2.  **Change at Specific Locations:**
    *   Locate the cell to right of top-most cell of first azure L-shape. Change this cell from color 0 to color 1.
    *   Locate the cell to the left of the bottom-most cell of second azure L-shape. Change this cell from color 0 to color 1.

3.  **Preservation:** All other cells in the grid remain unchanged. The two original azure L-shaped objects are preserved.

**Step-by-step transformation summary**
The transformation identifies cells that have specific relations to the L-shape objects and changes the color of cells in the described location. The other elements of the grid remain the same.
