Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[1,2], [4,4]]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure). The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white), which acts as the background.

2.  **Change at Specific Locations:**
    *   Locate the cell to right of top-most cell of first azure L-shape. Change this cell from color 0 to color 1.
    *   Locate the cell to the left of the bottom-most cell of second azure L-shape. Change this cell from color 0 to color 1.

3.  **Preservation:** All other cells in the grid remain unchanged. The two original azure L-shaped objects are preserved.

**Step-by-step transformation summary**
The transformation identifies cells that have specific relations to the L-shape objects and changes the color of cells in the described location. The other elements of the grid remain the same.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input_grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    expected_output_grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    output_grid = transform(input_grid)

    if output_grid == expected_output_grid:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output_grid)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)_grid

    print()
    assert output_grid == expected_output_grid, "Transformed output does not match expected output."
