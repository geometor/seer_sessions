Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of 3x3 grids. Each grid contains single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The transformation seems to operate on each number individually, consistently changing it to another specific number. The spatial arrangement of the numbers within the grid appears irrelevant, as the transformation is identical across all rows. This suggests a one-to-one mapping or substitution rule between input and output numbers.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - data_type: integer (0-9)
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - description: represents a color
  - transformation: substitution
    properties:
      - type: one-to-one mapping
      - description: Each input number is consistently replaced by a specific output number.
  - observation:
    description: The transformation is spatially invariant (position within the grid doesn't matter).
    
  - mappings:
      - input: 5
        output: 1
      - input: 8
        output: 9
      - input: 6
        output: 2
      - input: 2
        output: 6
      - input: 3
        output: 4
      - input: 9
        output: 8
      - input: 4
        output: 3
      - input: 1
        output: 5
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers.
2.  **Process:** For each cell in the input grid, apply the following substitution rule:
    *   If the input number is 5, replace it with 1.
    *   If the input number is 8, replace it with 9.
    *   If the input number is 6, replace it with 2.
    *   If the input number is 2, replace it with 6.
    *   If the input number is 3, replace it with 4.
    *   If the input number is 9, replace it with 8.
    *   If the input number is 4, replace it with 3.
    *   If the input number is 1, replace it with 5.
3.  **Output:** Return the modified 3x3 grid with the substituted values.
