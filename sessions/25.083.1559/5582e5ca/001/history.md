## train_1

**input:**
```
6 8 9
1 8 1
9 4 9
```


**output:**
```
9 9 9
9 9 9
9 9 9
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```


**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
4 6 9
6 4 1
8 8 6
```


**output:**
```
6 6 6
6 6 6
6 6 6
```

Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids (2D arrays) of single-digit integers, representing colors.
*   **Dimensions:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions in all provided examples.
*   **Single Color Output:** The output grid in each example consists of only one color, repeated throughout the entire grid.
*   **Dominant Input Color?:** I hypothesize the color of the output grid may be present in the input.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
      - cells: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - width: same as input_grid
      - height: same as input_grid
      - cells: all same integer (color)

actions:
  - name: determine_output_color
    description: Find a rule to map the input colors to a single color for the output grid
  - name: replicate_color
    description: Fill the output grid with the determined color.

relationships:
  - input_grid and output_grid have same dimensions.
  - output_grid cells all have the same value.
  - The output_grid color must be determined using a program applied to the input_grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Inspect the input grid:** Examine all the pixel color values within the input grid.
2.  **Determine the output color:** select the top left corner pixel of the input grid.
3.  **Create the output grid:**
    *   Create a new grid with the same dimensions (width and height) as the input grid.
    *   Fill every cell of the output grid with the color found in the previous step.

I believe the most obvious program is that output is defined by the top left pixel.
