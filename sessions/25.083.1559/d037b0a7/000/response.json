Each non-zero contiguous block of color is a separate object.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The transformation seems to involve a vertical \"filling\" or \"dripping\" effect. Colors appear to propagate downwards.\n*   **Color/Value Significance:** Zero (white) seems to act as a background or empty space, while other colors are the active elements that change.\n*   **Boundaries:** The edges of the grid act as boundaries that stop the downward propagation.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
