objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - type: color_block
    properties:
      - color: non-zero integer
      - shape: contiguous block
      - movement: downwards

actions:
  - name: fill_down
    description:  Non-zero color values propagate downwards, replacing 0 values.
    constraints:
      - stops at grid boundaries
      - stops at other non-zero values
      - the color that starts at top propagates downwards by extending the same top color

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Top-down propagation of color values.
  - type: boundary
    description: Grid edges and non-zero values limit color propagation.
