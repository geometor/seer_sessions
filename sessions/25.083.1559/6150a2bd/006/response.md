Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a plan to refine the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of rotating the grid counter-clockwise by 90 degrees was a good starting point, and the code correctly implements `np.rot90(input_grid, k=-1)`. However, the color remapping logic is flawed and doesn't consistently produce the correct output, as evidenced by the mismatches in both examples. The strategy needs to focus on correctly identifying the color transformation rule *after* the rotation. The errors are not in the rotation itself, but in the subsequent color mapping.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Mismappings:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for *both* examples. Identify the specific color mappings that are incorrect.
2.  **Identify the Correct Mapping Rule:** Determine the consistent rule that maps colors from the rotated input to the expected output. It may not be a simple one-to-one mapping.
3. **Metrics Gathering**: compute the color remapping using code.
4.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Revise the natural language program to accurately describe the rotation and the *correct* color remapping.
5. **Update Yaml Block**: Capture the observations in a structured format.

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (using code):**

I'll use python to create dictionaries showing the color mappings for each example, which helps clearly reveal the transformation rule.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_color_mapping(input_grid, expected_output):
    rotated_grid = np.rot90(input_grid, k=-1)
    mapping = {}
    for i in range(rotated_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(rotated_grid.shape[1]):
            rotated_value = rotated_grid[i, j]
            expected_value = expected_output[i, j]
            if rotated_value not in mapping:
                mapping[rotated_value] = expected_value
            elif mapping[rotated_value] != expected_value:
                print(f"Inconsistent mapping for {rotated_value}: {mapping[rotated_value]} and {expected_value}")
    return mapping

# Example 1
input1 = np.array([[5, 5, 2], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]])
expected1 = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [2, 5, 5]])
mapping1 = analyze_color_mapping(input1, expected1)
print(f"Example 1 Mapping: {mapping1}")

# Example 2
input2 = np.array([[3, 3, 8], [3, 7, 0], [5, 0, 0]])
expected2 = np.array([[0, 0, 5], [0, 7, 3], [8, 3, 3]])
mapping2 = analyze_color_mapping(input2, expected2)
print(f"Example 2 Mapping: {mapping2}")


```
```
Inconsistent mapping for 5: 0 and 1
Inconsistent mapping for 0: 0 and 2
Inconsistent mapping for 0: 0 and 5
Example 1 Mapping: {np.int64(0): np.int64(0), np.int64(1): np.int64(0), np.int64(5): np.int64(0), np.int64(2): np.int64(5)}
Inconsistent mapping for 3: 0 and 5
Inconsistent mapping for 3: 0 and 3
Inconsistent mapping for 0: 0 and 8
Inconsistent mapping for 0: 0 and 3
Example 2 Mapping: {np.int64(5): np.int64(0), np.int64(3): np.int64(0), np.int64(0): np.int64(0), np.int64(7): np.int64(7), np.int64(8): np.int64(3)}

```
**Analysis of Color Mapping Results:**

The `analyze_color_mapping` function reveals inconsistencies within each example, showing that the mapping isn't a simple one-to-one relationship. The printed output indicates conflicts for colors like 0, 3 and 5 in how the numbers map after the rotation.

By carefully inspecting the original input, the rotated grid, and the expected output, we will find the correct mapping.

Example 1:
Input:

```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


Rotated:

```
0 0 5
0 0 5
0 1 2
```


Expected output:

```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```


Observed mapping:

*   0 -> 0
*   1 -> 0
*   2 -> 2
*  5 -> appears as both 0 and 1 in different locations

Example 2:

Input:

```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


Rotated:

```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


Expected output:

```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


Observed mapping:
* 0 -> 0
* 3 -> 8, then 3 -> 3
* 5 -> 5
* 7 -> 7
* 8 -> 8, then 8 -> 3.

This shows how the function is making mistakes with the color mapping. It needs to correctly perform the following mapping *after* the rotation.

Example 1:
0 -> 0
1 -> 0
2 -> 2
5 -> 5, except when on top row then 0

Example 2:
0 -> 0
3 -> 3
5 -> 5
7 -> 7
8 -> 8

After rotation:

Example 1:

```
0 0 5
0 0 5
0 1 2
```


Example 2:


```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate:** Rotate the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
2.  **Remap Colors:**
    *   If the rotated color is 0, keep it 0.
    *   If the rotated color is 1, change it to 0.
    *   If the rotated color is 2, keep it 2.
    *   If the rotated color is 5, keep it 5, unless it is in the first row of the rotated output, change it to 0.
    *   If the rotated color is 3, keep it 3.
    *    If the rotated color is 7, keep it 7.
    *   If the rotated color is 8, keep it 8.
