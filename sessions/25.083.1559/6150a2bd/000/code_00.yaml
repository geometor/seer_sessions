elements:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output data are represented as 2D grids.
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - cells: contain integer values (0-9) representing colors

  - type: transformation
    description: A rule-based change from the input grid to the output grid.
    properties:
      - rotation: Input grid appears to be rotated counter-clockwise by 90 degrees.
      - value_mapping: Input cell values are consistently mapped to output cell values.
