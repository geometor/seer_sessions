Both grids appear to have the same dimensions within a single example, but dimensions can differ between examples.\n*   **Colors/Values:** Each cell in the grid has a single numerical value, representing a color.\n*   **Transformation:** There's a clear transformation happening, but it's not immediately obvious. It *seems* like the input grid is somehow rotated or mirrored and the digits are potentially remapped. The dimensions remain the same.\n* **Possible Rotation/Reflection**: It strongly looks like the input is rotated counter clockwise by 90 degrees.\n* **Consistent Digit Changes**: A given digit in input, corresponds to a particular digit in output.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

This means the top row of the input becomes the rightmost column of the output, and so on.
