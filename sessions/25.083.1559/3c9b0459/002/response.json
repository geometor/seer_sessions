            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the counter-clockwise rotation and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis of a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation is incorrect. While the output grid sizes are correct, and color palettes/counts are maintained, the pixel arrangements are consistently wrong across all examples. This indicates a different transformation rule is at play. The strategy should be to shift from rotation and explore other geometric transformations like reflections (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) or more complex rearrangements. We need to carefully examine the input-output pairs to discern the specific pattern of pixel movement.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analysis (using code execution would be ideal here, but I'll do it mentally for demonstration):**\n\nLet's describe the discrepancies concisely for each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input `[[8, 8, 8], [5, 5, 8], [8, 5, 5]]`, Expected `[[5, 5, 8], [8, 5, 5], [8, 8, 8]]`, Got `[[8, 8, 5], [8, 5, 5], [8, 5, 8]]`. The error isn't a simple rotation. The top row becomes the rightmost column, but in reverse order.\n*   **Example 2:** Input `[[9, 2, 4], [2, 4, 4], [2, 9, 2]]`, Expected `[[2, 9, 2], [4, 4, 2], [4, 2, 9]]`, Got `[[4, 4, 2], [2, 4, 9], [9, 2, 2]]`. Again, not a rotation. Columns are becoming rows, but there's a reversal involved.\n*   **Example 3:** Input `[[3, 2, 9], [9, 9, 9], [2, 3, 3]]`, Expected `[[3, 3, 2], [9, 9, 9], [9, 2, 3]]`, Got `[[9, 9, 3], [2, 9, 3], [3, 9, 2]]`. Similar pattern of column-to-row transformation with reversal.\n*   **Example 4:** Input `[[2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [2, 8, 1]]`, Expected `[[1, 8, 2], [2, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2]]`, Got `[[1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 8], [2, 2, 2]]`. The pattern persists.\n\nIt is looking like transposing rows and colums, but the order must be correct.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Each column of the input grid becomes a row in the output grid, but the order of elements within each column is reversed. Specifically, the first column of the input becomes the first row of the output, but the elements are arranged in reverse order (last element of the input column becomes the first element of the output row, and so on). This is repeated for all columns. In mathematical terms, the element at input\\[i]\\[j] becomes output\\[j]\\[n-1-i], where n is the number of input rows.\n"
