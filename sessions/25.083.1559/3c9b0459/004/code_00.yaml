facts:
  - observation: "The transformation involves transposing columns to rows."
  - observation: "The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same (3x3 in all examples)."
  - observation: "The number of pixels of each color is consistent between input and output."
  - observation: "The order of elements within the transposed rows is NOT a simple reversal of the original column."
  - observation: "The transformation involves some sort of cyclic permutation or a more complex reordering rule within each column."
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - action: transpose
    description: "Columns of the input grid become rows of the output grid."
  - action: reorder
    description: "Elements within each transposed column are reordered according to a rule that is not simple reversal."
