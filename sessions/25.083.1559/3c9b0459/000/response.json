Each cell in the grid contains a single digit, representing a color. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the cells within the grid, suggesting a permutation or rotation of some kind. The colors (represented by digits) themselves don't change; only their positions do.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
