## train_1

**input:**
```
8 8 8
5 5 8
8 5 5
```


**output:**
```
5 5 8
8 5 5
8 8 8
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
9 2 4
2 4 4
2 9 2
```


**output:**
```
2 9 2
4 4 2
4 2 9
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
3 2 9
9 9 9
2 3 3
```


**output:**
```
3 3 2
9 9 9
9 2 3
```


## train_4

**input:**
```
2 2 1
2 1 2
2 8 1
```


**output:**
```
1 8 2
2 1 2
1 2 2
```

Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit, representing a color. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the cells within the grid, suggesting a permutation or rotation of some kind. The colors (represented by digits) themselves don't change; only their positions do.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
properties:
  - grid:
    - has_rows: 3
    - has_columns: 3
    - elements_are: mutable
actions:
  - permute:
      description: Rearrange the elements of the grid.
      details:
        - type:
            likely: rotation or specific row/column swaps
relationships:
  - element_positions:
      before: input grid
      after: output grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observation:** The transformation appears to be a counter-clockwise rotation of the grid by 90 degrees.
    - train 1: first column becomes first row reversed; 2nd column becomes 2nd row reversed, 3rd column becomes 3rd row, reversed
    - train 2: same pattern
    - train 3: same pattern
    - train 4: same pattern

2. **Procedure**
Rotate the entire grid counter-clockwise by 90 degrees.
   1. the first row of output takes it's values, in reverse order, from the values of the first column of the input
   2. the second row of output takes it's values, in reverse order, from the values of the second column of the input
   3. the third row of output takes it's values, in reverse order, from the values of the third column of the input

This captures the relationship: Input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce output grid.
