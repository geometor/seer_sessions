1. Treat the input as a sequence of numbers.
2. Iterate through the sequence, taking two numbers at a time as a pair. If an odd number of elements exists, the last element forms a pair with itself.
3.  Within each pair:
    *   If the pair consists of two distinct elements, swap their positions in the output sequence.
    *   If the pair consists of a repeated single element, keep in the same place.
4. The new arrangement of elements constitutes the output.
