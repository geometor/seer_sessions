"""
Transforms a 3x3 grid of 0s and 2s into a single-digit integer based on 
the arrangement of the 2s (red pixels). If the red pixels form a vertical
or diagonal line of three, the output is 1. If they form an L-shape 
(rotated in any direction) with three pixels, the output is 7.  
Other patterns are undefined by the given examples.
