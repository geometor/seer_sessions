facts:
  - input_type: "3x3 grid"
  - input_values: [0, 2]
  - output_type: "single-digit integer"
  - observations:
    - "Output is 1 when red (2) pixels form a vertical or diagonal line of three"
    - "Output is 7 when red (2) pixels form an L-shape, open to any direction, always uses three red pixels"
    - "When input grid has other patterns than previous, the output seems related, but the rule is unclear"
