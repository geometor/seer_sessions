            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. The core idea of checking for adjacent green pixels was correct, but the condition \"at least one other green pixel directly above or below it AND at least one other green pixel directly to its left or right\" is insufficient and incorrectly implemented. The code checks for *any* vertical and horizontal green neighbor, not requiring them to form a continuous line or specific shape with the original green pixel.  The examples demonstrate a more complex relationship that likely involves connected components of green pixels. We need to detect the connected components.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Errors:** Carefully examine the \"pixels_off\" in each example. Understand *why* those pixels were incorrectly transformed (or not transformed). This involves visually comparing the input, expected output, and transformed output.\n2.  **Refine Adjacency Concept:** The current adjacency check is too broad. We need to consider connected components, not just immediate neighbors. Think of it like finding \"islands\" of green pixels.\n3.  **Iterative Improvement:** Start by making small, targeted adjustments to the natural language program, then translate those to code. Test frequently. Don't try to fix everything at once.\n4. Explore shapes. Look for shapes.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per example):**\n\nI will use a more concise, observation-based format here, noting specific pixels that were incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Pixels off: (2,2), (3,3) - should be yellow, stayed green.\n    *   Observation: These green pixels *do* have vertical and horizontal neighbors. So the basic neighbor rule fails. They are part of \"L\" shaped configurations.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Pixels off: (4,6), (5,5), (6,4) - Mixed errors.\n    *   Observation: (4,6) is correct, (5,5) should be yellow. (6,4) should have turned to yellow.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    Pixels off: Many, mainly around the central connected green area.\n    *   Observation: The large central connected green area is where most errors happen. The rule appears to \"protect\" internal green pixels more than the existing code allows.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *  Pixels off: Many, across many connected green configurations.\n    *   Observation: More complex configurations; the simple adjacency rule breaks down significantly. Interior green changes.\n\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Pixels off: Very many, highlights the inadequacy of the original rule.\n    *   Observation: Complex and diverse connected green areas. Demonstrates that a completely green connected group must be more than 2 pixels in size before yellow conversion occurs.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 002\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    objects:\n      - color: green (3)\n        shape: L-shaped\n        transformation:\n          - location: (2,2) # 1-indexed for clarity in report\n            from: green\n            to: yellow # expected\n          - location: (3,3)\n            from: green\n            to: yellow\n    actions:\n      - type: color_change\n        condition: \"green pixel within a connected green component larger than 2 pixels\"\n        result: \"change to yellow\"\n  - example_id: 2\n    objects:\n      - color: green\n        shape: Various connected components\n    actions:\n      - type: color_change\n        condition: \"green pixel within a connected green component larger than 2 pixels\"\n        result: \"change to yellow\"\n  - example_id: 3, 4, 5\n    objects:\n      - color: green\n        shape: complex connected component\n    actions:\n      - type: color_change\n        condition: \"green pixel within a connected green component larger than 2 pixels\"\n        result: \"change to yellow\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Revised):**\n\nA green (3) pixel changes to yellow (4) if and only if it is part of a connected component of green pixels that includes *more than two* pixels. If a green pixel is isolated (no adjacent green pixels) or is part of a connected component of *only* two pixels, it remains green. The connected component must be connected either horizontally or vertically.\n"
