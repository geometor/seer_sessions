Above each gray line (or at the top of the grid), there's a row containing a colored object pattern, usually surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The remaining rows are typically entirely white.\n2.  **Object Progression:** The colored object pattern changes systematically as you move down the input grid from one section to the next (across the gray separators).\n    *   In `train_1`, the object `2 2 3` (red, red, green) maintains its shape but shifts one position to the right in each subsequent section.\n    *   In `train_2`, the object consists of a sequence of blue pixels (`1`). Its starting position remains fixed at the left edge (column 0), but its length increases by 2 pixels in each subsequent section (2, 4, 6, 8).\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The task is to predict the *next* state of the colored object based on the observed progression in the input.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output is a much smaller grid (3 rows high, same width as the input). The predicted next state of the colored object is placed in the middle row (row index 1), surrounded by white rows (row indices 0 and 2). The horizontal positioning and shape/size of the object in the output correspond to the extrapolated next step from the input sequence.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

These lines separate distinct \"stages\" of a sequence.\n2.  Identify the row containing a non-gray, non-white object pattern within each stage (typically the row directly above a gray line or the first relevant row at the top). Record the sequence of these object patterns and their properties (shape, size, starting column index).\n3.  Analyze how the object pattern changes from one stage to the next in the sequence. Determine the rule of progression. This could involve changes in position (e.g., horizontal shift) or changes in size/shape (e.g., increasing length).\n4.  Take the *last* object pattern observed in the input sequence.\n5.  Apply the determined progression rule one more time to this last pattern to calculate the properties (shape, size, position) of the *next* pattern in the sequence.\n6.  Create a new grid with the same width as the input grid and a height of 3 rows, filled initially with the background color (white, 0).\n7.  Place the calculated next object pattern into the middle row (row index 1) of this new grid, according to its calculated horizontal position.\n8.  The resulting 3xN grid is the final output."
