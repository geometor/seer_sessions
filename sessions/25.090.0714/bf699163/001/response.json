Scan the input grid to find all occurrences of 3x3 hollow square objects. A 3x3 hollow square is defined as a 3x3 area where the 8 border cells have the same color (object color) and the central cell has the background color. Record the object color and the coordinates of the center cell for each found object.\n3. Scan the input grid to find all pixels with the selector color (orange, 7).\n4. Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by the selector pixels to define their bounding box.\n5. Calculate the center coordinates (row, column) of this bounding box: `center_row = (min_row + max_row) / 2`, `center_col = (min_col + max_col) / 2`.\n6. For each 3x3 hollow square object identified in step 2, calculate the Manhattan distance between its center coordinates and the calculated center of the selector bounding box.\n7. Select the 3x3 hollow square object that has the minimum distance calculated in step 6. Note its object color.\n8. Construct a new 3x3 output grid. Fill the 8 border cells with the selected object's color and the central cell with the background color (gray, 5).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_hollow_squares(grid, bg_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all 3x3 hollow square objects in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        bg_color (int): The background color.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of tuples, each containing (center_row, center_col, object_color).\n    \"\"\"\n    hollow_squares = []\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    for r in range(height - 2):\n        for c in range(width - 2):\n            subgrid = grid[r:r+3, c:c+3]\n            center_pixel = subgrid[1, 1]\n            \n            # Check if the center is the background color\n            if center_pixel == bg_color:\n                border_pixels = np.array([\n                    subgrid[0, 0], subgrid[0, 1], subgrid[0, 2],\n                    subgrid[1, 0],                 subgrid[1, 2],\n                    subgrid[2, 0], subgrid[2, 1], subgrid[2, 2]\n                ])\n                \n                # Check if all border pixels are the same and not the background color\n                first_border_pixel = border_pixels[0]\n                if first_border_pixel != bg_color and np.all(border_pixels == first_border_pixel):\n                    hollow_squares.append(((r + 1), (c + 1), first_border_pixel))\n    return hollow_squares\n\ndef find_bounding_box_center(grid, selector_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the center of the bounding box containing all pixels of the selector_color.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        selector_color (int): The color of the selector pixels.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (center_row, center_col) or None if no selector pixels found.\n    \"\"\"\n    selector_coords = np.argwhere(grid == selector_color)\n    if selector_coords.size == 0:\n        return None\n        \n    min_row = np.min(selector_coords[:, 0])\n    max_row = np.max(selector_coords[:, 0])\n    min_col = np.min(selector_coords[:, 1])\n    max_col = np.max(selector_coords[:, 1])\n    \n    center_row = (min_row + max_row) / 2.0\n    center_col = (min_col + max_col) / 2.0\n    \n    return center_row, center_col\n\ndef calculate_manhattan_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Manhattan distance between two points.\n\n    Args:\n        point1 (tuple): (row1, col1)\n        point2 (tuple): (row2, col2)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The Manhattan distance.\n    \"\"\"\n    return abs(point1[0] - point2[0]) + abs(point1[1] - point2[1])\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on finding the 3x3 hollow square closest\n    to the center of the bounding box of orange pixels.\n    \n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: A 3x3 numpy array representing the output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid)\n    background_color = 5\n    selector_color = 7\n\n    # 1.
