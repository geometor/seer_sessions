1. Identify the background color (gray, 5) and the selector color (orange, 7).
2. Scan the input grid to find all occurrences of 3x3 hollow square objects. A 3x3 hollow square is defined as a 3x3 area where the 8 border cells have the same color (object color) and the central cell has the background color. Record the object color and the coordinates of the center cell for each found object.
3. Scan the input grid to find all pixels with the selector color (orange, 7).
4. Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by the selector pixels to define their bounding box.
5. Calculate the center coordinates (row, column) of this bounding box: `center_row = (min_row + max_row) / 2`, `center_col = (min_col + max_col) / 2`.
6. For each 3x3 hollow square object identified in step 2, calculate the Manhattan distance between its center coordinates and the calculated center of the selector bounding box.
7. Select the 3x3 hollow square object that has the minimum distance calculated in step 6. Note its object color.
8. Construct a new 3x3 output grid. Fill the 8 border cells with the selected object's color and the central cell with the background color (gray, 5).
