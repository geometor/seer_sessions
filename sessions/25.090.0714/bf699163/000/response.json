Scattered across this background are several distinct objects.\n2.  **Object Types:**\n    *   **Target Objects:** The most prominent objects are 3x3 \"hollow squares\" or \"frames\". These consist of 8 pixels of a specific color (e.g., blue, red, green, yellow, azure, magenta) surrounding a single central pixel of the gray background color.\n    *   **Selector Objects:** There are also pixels of orange (7). These orange pixels do not form a clear, single geometric shape but appear somewhat scattered, often forming sparse lines or segments (both horizontal and vertical in the examples).\n    *   **Background:** The rest of the grid is filled with the gray (5) background color.\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is always a 3x3 grid. It perfectly replicates one of the 3x3 hollow square objects found in the input grid, preserving its color and the central background pixel.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core task is to identify which of the several 3x3 hollow square objects from the input should be reproduced in the output. The orange (7) pixels seem to act as a selector or pointer.\n5.  **Selection Mechanism:** By observing the examples, the 3x3 hollow square object that appears in the output is the one located closest to the geometric center of the bounding box encompassing all orange (7) pixels in the input grid. The distance calculation appears to work well using the center pixel of the 3x3 square and the calculated center of the orange bounding box.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Scan the input grid to find all occurrences of 3x3 hollow square objects. A 3x3 hollow square is defined as a 3x3 area where the 8 border cells have the same color (object color) and the central cell has the background color. Record the object color and the coordinates of the center cell for each found object.\n3.  Scan the input grid to find all pixels with the selector color (orange, 7).\n4.  Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by the selector pixels to define their bounding box.\n5.  Calculate the center coordinates (row, column) of this bounding box: `center_row = (min_row + max_row) / 2`, `center_col = (min_col + max_col) / 2`.\n6.  For each 3x3 hollow square object identified in step 2, calculate the distance (e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean distance) between its center coordinates and the calculated center of the selector bounding box.\n7.  Select the 3x3 hollow square object that has the minimum distance calculated in step 6. Note its object color.\n8.  Construct a new 3x3 output grid. Fill the 8 border cells with the selected object's color and the central cell with the background color (gray, 5)."
