            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Relationship:** The output grid is always exactly 3 times larger than the input grid in both height and width. This suggests a tiling operation where the input grid (or a modified version of it) is repeated 3x3 times to form the output.\n2.  **Color Preservation:** Non-white pixels (colors 1 through 9) present in the input grid seem to retain their original color and relative positions within each tile of the output grid.\n3.  **Color Transformation (White Pixels):** White pixels (color 0) in the input grid are transformed into either blue (color 1) or green (color 3) in the output grid.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation of white pixels depends on their spatial relationship to the non-white pixels in the original input grid.\n    *   White pixels that are orthogonally adjacent (sharing a side, not just a corner) to any non-white pixel in the input grid are transformed into blue (1).\n    *   White pixels that are *not* orthogonally adjacent to any non-white pixel (including those only diagonally adjacent or further away) are transformed into green (3).\n5.  **Process:** The transformation likely involves two main steps:\n    *   First, determine the color transformation for each pixel in the input grid based on the adjacency rule described above. This creates a \"modified\" version of the input grid pattern.\n    *   Second, tile this modified pattern 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically to create the final output grid.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
