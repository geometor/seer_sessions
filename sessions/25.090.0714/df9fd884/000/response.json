Other colors like blue (1), red (2), and azure (8) appear as single objects in different examples.\n3.  **Objects**:\n    *   **Background**: The orange (7) pixels fill most of the grid.\n    *   **Anchors**: There are always two distinct objects made of yellow (4) pixels. These objects resemble L-shapes (sometimes rotated or incomplete due to grid edges). Their positions remain unchanged between input and output.\n    *   **Mover**: There is exactly one other object, composed of a single color (blue, red, or azure, varying per example). This object changes its position from the input to the output grid.\n4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation is the movement of the 'Mover' object. The 'Anchor' objects and the background color stay constant, except where the Mover object moves from (filled with background) and moves to (overwriting background).\n5.  **Movement Pattern**: The Mover object starts near one of the yellow Anchors (the 'Source Anchor') and moves to a position near the *other* yellow Anchor (the 'Target Anchor'). The final position seems to be adjacent to the Target Anchor, specifically in the quadrant *opposite* to the quadrant the Mover initially occupied relative to the Source Anchor. For example, if the Mover started South-East of the Source Anchor, it moves to be North-West of the Target Anchor.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify the two distinct, non-background objects composed solely of yellow (4) pixels. These are the static 'Anchor' objects.\n3.  Identify the single remaining non-background, non-yellow object. This is the 'Mover' object. Note its shape, color, and original position (e.g., bounding box).\n4.  Determine which of the two Anchors the Mover is initially closer to. This is the 'Source Anchor'. The other is the 'Target Anchor'. (Closeness can be determined by comparing distances between the centers of the bounding boxes of the Mover and each Anchor).\n5.  Determine the relative quadrant (North-West, North-East, South-West, South-East) of the Mover's center relative to the Source Anchor's center.\n6.  Determine the target quadrant, which is the quadrant diagonally opposite the initial relative quadrant (e.g., if the Mover was North-West of the Source, the target quadrant is South-East relative to the Target Anchor).\n7.  Calculate the new position for the Mover object such that it is placed adjacent to the Target Anchor, positioned within the target quadrant determined in step 6. Ensure the Mover does not overlap the Target Anchor. The placement should maintain the Mover's original shape and orientation.\n8.  Create the output grid: start with a copy of the input grid. Fill the original position of the Mover object with the background color. Draw the Mover object (with its original color and shape) at the new position calculated in step 7."
