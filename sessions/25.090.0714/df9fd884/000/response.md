Okay, let's analyze the task.

## Perception of the Elements

1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are grids of varying sizes (9x9, 8x8, 9x9).
2.  **Colors**: The primary colors are orange (7), which acts as the background, and yellow (4). Other colors like blue (1), red (2), and azure (8) appear as single objects in different examples.
3.  **Objects**:
    *   **Background**: The orange (7) pixels fill most of the grid.
    *   **Anchors**: There are always two distinct objects made of yellow (4) pixels. These objects resemble L-shapes (sometimes rotated or incomplete due to grid edges). Their positions remain unchanged between input and output.
    *   **Mover**: There is exactly one other object, composed of a single color (blue, red, or azure, varying per example). This object changes its position from the input to the output grid.
4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation is the movement of the 'Mover' object. The 'Anchor' objects and the background color stay constant, except where the Mover object moves from (filled with background) and moves to (overwriting background).
5.  **Movement Pattern**: The Mover object starts near one of the yellow Anchors (the 'Source Anchor') and moves to a position near the *other* yellow Anchor (the 'Target Anchor'). The final position seems to be adjacent to the Target Anchor, specifically in the quadrant *opposite* to the quadrant the Mover initially occupied relative to the Source Anchor. For example, if the Mover started South-East of the Source Anchor, it moves to be North-West of the Target Anchor.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Move a uniquely colored object from its position near one static yellow anchor to a position near the other static yellow anchor, placing it in the opposite relative quadrant.

  - contains_exactly_one_other_colored_object: true

objects:
  - id: anchor1
    color: 4 (yellow)

    static: true
    description: One of the two fixed yellow shapes.
  - id: anchor2
    color: 4 (yellow)
    shape: L-like
    static: true
    description: The other fixed yellow shape.
  - id: mover
    color: variable (non-yellow, non-background; e.g., blue, red, azure)
    shape: variable (e.g., square, bar, T-shape)
    static: false
    description: The object that changes position.

relationships:
  - type: proximity
    object1: mover (initial position)
    object2: [anchor1, anchor2]
    relation: The mover object starts closer to one anchor (Source Anchor) than the other (Target Anchor). Proximity can be measured center-to-center or bounding-box distance.
  - type: relative_positioning (quadrant)
    object1: mover (initial position)
    reference: Source Anchor
    relation: The mover occupies a specific quadrant (e.g., North-West, South-East) relative to the Source Anchor's center/bounding box.
  - type: relative_positioning (quadrant)
    object1: mover (final position)
    reference: Target Anchor
    relation: The mover is placed adjacent to the Target Anchor in the quadrant *opposite* to its initial quadrant relative to the Source Anchor. (e.g., if started NW of Source, ends SE of Target).

  - action: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: [anchor1, anchor2, mover, background_color]
  - action: determine_source_target_anchors
    inputs: [anchor1, anchor2, mover]
    outputs: [source_anchor, target_anchor]
    logic: Find which anchor the mover is initially closest to.
  - action: determine_relative_quadrant
    inputs: [mover, source_anchor]
    outputs: initial_quadrant
    logic: Calculate the quadrant (NW, NE, SW, SE) of the mover relative to the source anchor.
  - action: determine_target_quadrant
    inputs: initial_quadrant
    outputs: target_quadrant
    logic: Find the quadrant opposite the initial_quadrant (NW <-> SE, NE <-> SW).
  - action: calculate_new_position
    inputs: [mover, target_anchor, target_quadrant]
    outputs: new_mover_position_bounding_box
    logic: Place the mover object adjacent to the target_anchor within the target_quadrant, without overlapping the anchor. The exact adjacency depends on the anchor's shape and the quadrant.
  - action: modify_grid
    inputs: [input_grid, mover, mover_original_position, new_mover_position]
    outputs: output_grid
    logic: Create the output grid by taking the input grid, filling the mover's original position with the background color, and drawing the mover at its new position.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the background color (typically orange/7).
2.  Identify the two distinct, non-background objects composed solely of yellow (4) pixels. These are the static 'Anchor' objects.
3.  Identify the single remaining non-background, non-yellow object. This is the 'Mover' object. Note its shape, color, and original position (e.g., bounding box).
4.  Determine which of the two Anchors the Mover is initially closer to. This is the 'Source Anchor'. The other is the 'Target Anchor'. (Closeness can be determined by comparing distances between the centers of the bounding boxes of the Mover and each Anchor).
5.  Determine the relative quadrant (North-West, North-East, South-West, South-East) of the Mover's center relative to the Source Anchor's center.
6.  Determine the target quadrant, which is the quadrant diagonally opposite the initial relative quadrant (e.g., if the Mover was North-West of the Source, the target quadrant is South-East relative to the Target Anchor).
7.  Calculate the new position for the Mover object such that it is placed adjacent to the Target Anchor, positioned within the target quadrant determined in step 6. Ensure the Mover does not overlap the Target Anchor. The placement should maintain the Mover's original shape and orientation.
8.  Create the output grid: start with a copy of the input grid. Fill the original position of the Mover object with the background color. Draw the Mover object (with its original color and shape) at the new position calculated in step 7.
