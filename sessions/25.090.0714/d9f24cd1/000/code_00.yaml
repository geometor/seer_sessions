task_description: Fill columns based on indicators in the last row, preserving obstacles.
grid_properties:
  size: Fixed at 10x10 for the examples shown.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: Can be white (0), red (2), or gray (5).
      location: Defined by row and column index.
  - type: column
    properties:
      index: Column number.
      contains_trigger: Defined by having a red (2) pixel in the last row (row 9).
relationships:
  - type: obstacle
    description: Gray (5) pixels act as obstacles that are not overwritten during the column fill.
  - type: trigger
    description: Red (2) pixels in the last row trigger the filling of their respective columns.
actions:
  - name: identify_trigger_columns
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_column_indices
    description: Find the indices of columns containing a red (2) pixel in the last row.
  - name: identify_obstacles
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_obstacle_coordinates
    description: Find the coordinates (row, col) of all gray (5) pixels.
  - name: fill_columns
    input: input_grid, trigger_columns, obstacle_coordinates
    output: output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input. Then, for each trigger column, change all white (0) pixels and original last-row red (2) pixels to red (2), leaving gray (5) pixels unchanged.
