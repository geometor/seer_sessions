They are not overwritten by red (2).\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to be a column-filling operation triggered by the presence of a red (2) pixel in the last row of a column. The filling color is red (2), but this fill respects existing gray (5) pixels, leaving them unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
