"""
Propagates red color (2) upwards from trigger cells (red '2' in the last row)
within their columns. If an upward propagation encounters a barrier cell (gray '5'),
it stops below the barrier in that column and 'spills over' into the adjacent 
column to the right (if it exists), filling that adjacent column from the top 
down to the row *below* the barrier row. Original gray cells are always preserved.
