            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code implemented a simpler hypothesis: fill triggered columns entirely, only preserving gray pixels if they happened to fall within a filled column. The failed test results show a more complex interaction is occurring.\n\nSpecifically, the failures indicate:\n1.  Gray pixels act as *barriers* that stop the upward propagation of red from the trigger row within the *same* column.\n2.  When propagation is stopped by a gray barrier, the red color \"spills over\" into the column immediately to the right and propagates upwards in that adjacent column, up to the row *below* the barrier.\n3.  The initial copying of the grid and then overwriting handles the preservation of gray pixels correctly, even those affected by spillover, provided the overwrite happens *after* all filling operations.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the natural language program and subsequent code to incorporate these two new rules: barrier stopping and spillover filling.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nNo specific numerical metrics require code execution at this stage. The core issue is logical, identifiable by comparing the structure and locations of differences between expected and actual outputs relative to the input features (triggers and gray pixels).\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 10x10\n    *   Output Size: 10x10\n    *   Triggers (Red=2 in last row): Columns 1, 4, 7\n    *   Obstacles (Gray=5): (3,5), (5,1), (6,8)\n    *   Barrier Interaction: Trigger in col 1 stopped by obstacle at (5,1).\n    *   Spillover: Stop at (5,1) causes spill into col 2, filling rows 0-6.\n    *   Columns 4 and 7 fill completely as they have triggers but no obstacles *within their own column*.\n    *   Discrepancy Cause: Original code did not implement barrier stopping or spillover. It incorrectly filled col 1 above row 5 and did not fill col 2 at all.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 10x10\n    *   Output Size: 10x10\n    *   Triggers (Red=2 in last row): Columns 1, 4, 6\n    *   Obstacles (Gray=5): (3,6), (5,2)\n    *   Barrier Interaction: Trigger in col 6 stopped by obstacle at (3,6).\n    *   Spillover: Stop at (3,6) causes spill into col 7, filling rows 0-4.\n    *   Columns 1 and 4 fill completely as they have triggers but no obstacles *within their own column*.\n    *   Discrepancy Cause: Original code did not implement barrier stopping correctly (filled col 6 above row 3) and did not implement spillover (did not fill col 7).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
