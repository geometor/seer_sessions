task_description: Propagate color upwards from triggers in the last row, stopping at barriers and spilling into the next column.
grid_properties:
  size: Fixed at 10x10 for the examples shown.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: Can be white (0), red (2), or gray (5).
      location: Defined by row and column index.
  - type: trigger
    properties:
      location: A red (2) pixel in the last row (row 9).
      column_index: The column where the trigger resides.
  - type: barrier
    properties:
      location: A gray (5) pixel anywhere in the grid.
      column_index: The column where the barrier resides.
relationships:
  - type: blocks
    description: A barrier (gray=5) pixel at (R_gray, C) blocks upward propagation originating from a trigger in the same column C. The propagation stops at row R_gray + 1.
  - type: causes_spillover
    description: A barrier at (R_gray, C) blocking upward propagation causes red (2) to spill into the adjacent column C+1 (if it exists) and propagate upwards from row R_gray + 1 to row 0.
actions:
  - name: identify_triggers
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_trigger_column_indices
    description: Find the indices of columns containing a red (2) pixel in the last row.
  - name: identify_barriers
    input: input_grid
    output: dictionary_of_highest_barrier_per_column
    description: For each column, find the row index of the highest gray (5) pixel (closest to row 0). Store as {column_index: row_index}. If no barrier, store None or skip.
  - name: propagate_and_spill
    input: input_grid, trigger_columns, barrier_map
    output: output_grid
    description:
      1. Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      2. Create a set to track cells to be colored red.
      3. For each trigger_column C:
         a. Check barrier_map for the highest barrier at (R_gray, C).
         b. If no barrier in C: Mark all cells (row, C) for 0 <= row < grid_height as red.
         c. If barrier at (R_gray, C):
            i. Mark cells (row, C) for R_gray < row < grid_height as red.
            ii. If column C+1 exists: Mark cells (row, C+1) for 0 <= row <= R_gray + 1 as red.
      4. Apply the red markings: Iterate through the marked red cells (r, c). If output_grid[r, c] is not gray (5), set output_grid[r, c] = red (2).
      5. (Alternative Step 4, simpler): Iterate through the marked red cells (r, c) and set output_grid[r, c] = red (2). Then, iterate through *all* original gray pixels from the input and ensure they are gray in the output_grid.
