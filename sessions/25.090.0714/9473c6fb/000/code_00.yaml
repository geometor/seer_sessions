Grid:
  - background_color: 7 (Orange)
  - properties:
      - remains unchanged between input and output.
Objects:
  - type: NonBackgroundPixels
  - description: Pixels with colors other than the background color (Orange, 7).
  - input_colors: Variable, includes 1 (Blue), 4 (Yellow), 6 (Magenta), 9 (Maroon).
  - output_colors: Fixed set [2 (Red), 5 (Gray), 8 (Azure)].
  - identification_process: Scan the grid row by row, column by column.
  - relationships:
      - Each non-background pixel in the input corresponds to exactly one pixel position in the output.
      - The position remains the same, but the color changes.
Transformation:
  - type: ConditionalCyclicalColorReplacement
  - steps:
      1. Identify all non-background pixels and their coordinates.
      2. Order these pixels based on scanline order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
      3. Determine the color of the *last* pixel in this order from the input grid.
      4. Select the replacement color cycle:
         - If the last pixel's color is 6 (Magenta), the cycle is [2 (Red), 5 (Gray), 8 (Azure)].
         - Otherwise, the cycle is [2 (Red), 8 (Azure), 5 (Gray)].
      5. Iterate through the ordered non-background pixels. Assign the i-th pixel (0-indexed) the color from the selected cycle at index (i mod 3).
      6. Keep background pixels (Orange, 7) unchanged.
