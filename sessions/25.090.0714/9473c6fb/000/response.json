            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation in this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with varying dimensions across examples.\n2.  **Background Color:** The color Orange (7) acts as a static background. Its position and value remain unchanged from input to output.\n3.  **Active Colors (Input):** The input grids feature other colors besides the background Orange (7). These include Maroon (9), Magenta (6), Yellow (4), and Blue (1). These are the colors that undergo transformation.\n4.  **Active Colors (Output):** The output grids replace the input active colors with a specific set of output colors: Red (2), Gray (5), and Azure (8). The background Orange (7) remains.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation involves replacing the non-Orange input pixels with one of the three output colors (Red, Gray, Azure). The specific output color assigned to a position depends on the *order* in which the non-Orange pixels are encountered when scanning the grid (row by row, top to bottom, left to right) and on a condition determined by the input grid itself.\n6.  **Cyclical Pattern:** The output colors (Red, Gray, Azure) are assigned cyclically to the non-Orange pixels based on their scanline order.\n7.  **Cycle Variation:** There are two distinct cycles observed:\n    *   Cycle A: [Red (2), Azure (8), Gray (5)]\n    *   Cycle B: [Red (2), Gray (5), Azure (8)]\n8.  **Cycle Determinant:** The choice between Cycle A and Cycle B appears to depend on the color of the *last* non-Orange pixel encountered in the scanline order. If the last non-Orange pixel is Magenta (6), Cycle B is used. Otherwise, Cycle A is used.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through the sorted list of non-Orange pixel coordinates, keeping track of the position (index `i`, starting from 0) of each coordinate in the list.\n8.  For each coordinate at index `i`, determine the replacement color by selecting the color from the chosen cycle at position `i modulo 3`.\n9.  Update the pixel at the current coordinate in the *output* grid with this replacement color.\n10. After iterating through all non-Orange pixel coordinates, return the modified output grid."
