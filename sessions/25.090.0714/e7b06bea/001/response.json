Identify the rightmost contiguous block of non-background (0), non-gray (5) vertical lines. Each column in this block must consist entirely of a single color.\n2. Extract the colors (C1, C2, ..., Ck) from left to right within this block, and note the column index (min_col) of the block's leftmost column.\n3. Determine a repetition factor 'rep' by finding the height of the contiguous segment of gray (5) pixels starting from the top-left cell (0,0). If cell (0,0) is not gray or column 0 doesn't exist, default 'rep' to 1. Ensure 'rep' is at least 1.\n4. Calculate the target column index for the output line: target_col = min_col - 1.\n5. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (0).\n6. Populate the 'target_col' in the output grid row by row. For each row 'r', the color used is determined by cycling through the extracted colors C1...Ck, where each color is repeated 'rep' times consecutively. The formula for the color is colors[(r // rep) % k].\n7. Check if the input grid contains any gray (5) pixels in column 0.\n8. If gray pixels exist in column 0 of the input grid AND the calculated 'target_col' is not equal to 3, then copy the entire contents of column 0 from the input grid to column 0 of the output grid. Otherwise, column 0 of the output grid remains background color (unless it is the target_col itself).\n9. Return the final output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Constants for colors\nBG_COLOR = 0\nGRAY_COLOR = 5\n\ndef _find_rightmost_colored_block(grid_np):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the rightmost contiguous block of columns where each column\n    consists of a single, non-background, non-gray color.\n    \n    Args:\n        grid_np: numpy array representation of the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple (block_colors, min_col):\n        - block_colors: A list of the colors in the block, ordered left-to-right.\n        - min_col: The column index of the leftmost column in the block.\n        Returns (None, -1) if no such block is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid_np.shape\n    block_colors = []\n    min_col = -1\n    max_col = -1\n\n    # Iterate columns from right to left\n    for c in range(width - 1, -1, -1):\n        column = grid_np[:, c]\n        unique_colors = np.unique(column)\n\n        # Check if column is a single, valid (non-BG, non-Gray) color\n        is_valid_column = (len(unique_colors) == 1 and \n                           unique_colors[0] != BG_COLOR and \n                           unique_colors[0] != GRAY_COLOR)\n\n        if is_valid_column:\n            # If this is the first valid column found (searching from right)\n            if max_col == -1:\n                max_col = c\n                min_col = c\n                block_colors.insert(0, unique_colors[0]) # Add color to start of list\n            # If this column is directly left of the current block start\n            elif c == min_col - 1:\n                min_col = c # Extend block to the left\n                block_colors.insert(0, unique_colors[0]) # Add color to start of list\n            # If it's valid but not adjacent (gap found), means we finished the rightmost block\n            else:\n                break \n        # If column is invalid and we were previously tracking a block, stop.\n        elif max_col != -1:\n            break # We have found the complete rightmost block\n\n    if not block_colors:\n        return None, -1\n    else:\n        return block_colors, min_col\n\ndef _get_gray_line_height(grid_np):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the height of the contiguous gray segment starting at (0,0).\n    \n    Args:\n        grid_np: numpy array representation of the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        Integer height of the gray segment.
