## Perception

1.  **Input Structure**: The input grids typically feature a vertical gray (5) line segment starting at the top-left corner (column 0). To the right, separated by white (0) background columns, there is a block of two or more adjacent vertical lines of different, non-white, non-gray colors. These colored lines always extend the full height of the grid.
2.  **Output Structure**: The output grid is largely white (0). It contains a single vertical line composed of segments of the colors from the input's rightmost block of colored lines. This new line is positioned one column to the left of where the leftmost line of the input block was. The colors in the output line cycle through the colors of the input lines (read left-to-right) from top to bottom. The original gray line from column 0 of the input is usually preserved in the output, *except* in one specific case (Example 3).
3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves identifying the rightmost contiguous block of non-background, non-gray vertical lines in the input. The colors of these lines are extracted in order (left-to-right). A new vertical line is constructed in the output grid, one column to the left of the original block's starting column. This new line cycles through the extracted colors row by row. The original colored lines are removed.
4.  **Gray Line Handling**: The gray line at column 0 is copied from input to output unless the newly constructed colored line is placed specifically in column 3. If the new line is in column 3, the gray line is omitted from the output, leaving column 0 white.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills most of the grid initially and in the output
  - id: gray_line
    color: gray (5)
    location: always starts at (0, 0) in input, variable height
    presence: optional in input (present in all examples), conditionally present in output
  - id: colored_lines_block
    description: A contiguous block of 2 or more columns containing vertical lines of non-white, non-gray colors. Located to the right of the gray_line, separated by background. Always extends full grid height.
    properties:
      - colors: list of colors, one per column, read left-to-right
      - leftmost_column_index: the column index of the first line in the block
  - id: output_line
    description: A single vertical line in the output grid, extending full height.
    properties:
      - colors: derived by cycling through the colors of the input colored_lines_block
      - column_index: calculated based on the input colored_lines_block position

actions:
  - identify: locate the rightmost block of adjacent, non-white, non-gray vertical lines in the input.
  - extract: get the colors (C1, C2, ..., Ck) and the leftmost column index (min_col) of this block.
  - calculate_target_column: determine the output column index as `target_col = min_col - 1`.
  - create_output_grid: initialize a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
  - construct_output_line: fill the `target_col` of the output grid by cycling through C1, C2, ..., Ck row by row.
  - handle_gray_line:
      - check: if a gray_line exists at column 0 in the input.
      - condition: if `target_col` is not equal to 3.
      - copy: if the condition is true, copy the input gray_line to column 0 of the output grid.

relationships:
  - spatial: the output_line is positioned one column to the left of the input colored_lines_block's starting column.
  - conditional_preservation: the gray_line is preserved from input to output if and only if the calculated `target_col` for the output_line is not 3.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid from right to left, column by column, to find the rightmost block of adjacent columns where each column consists entirely of a single non-white (0) and non-gray (5) color.
3.  Identify the list of colors (C1, C2, ..., Ck) present in this block, reading from the leftmost column to the rightmost column of the block.
4.  Determine the column index (`min_col`) of the leftmost column in this identified block.
5.  Calculate the target column index for the output line: `target_col = min_col - 1`.
6.  Populate the `target_col` in the output grid: For each row `r` from 0 to height-1, set the color of the cell at (`r`, `target_col`) to `C[(r mod k) + 1]`, where `k` is the number of colors identified in step 3. (Using 1-based indexing for colors C1..Ck temporarily for modulo arithmetic clarity, equivalent to `colors[r % k]`).
7.  Check if the input grid contains any gray (5) pixels in column 0.
8.  If gray pixels exist in column 0 of the input grid AND the calculated `target_col` is not equal to 3, then copy the contents of column 0 from the input grid to column 0 of the output grid.
9.  Return the final output grid.
