To the right, separated by white (0) background columns, there is a block of two or more adjacent vertical lines of different, non-white, non-gray colors. These colored lines always extend the full height of the grid.\n2.  **Output Structure**: The output grid is largely white (0). It contains a single vertical line composed of segments of the colors from the input's rightmost block of colored lines. This new line is positioned one column to the left of where the leftmost line of the input block was. The colors in the output line cycle through the colors of the input lines (read left-to-right) from top to bottom. The original gray line from column 0 of the input is usually preserved in the output, *except* in one specific case (Example 3).\n3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves identifying the rightmost contiguous block of non-background, non-gray vertical lines in the input. The colors of these lines are extracted in order (left-to-right). A new vertical line is constructed in the output grid, one column to the left of the original block's starting column. This new line cycles through the extracted colors row by row. The original colored lines are removed.\n4.  **Gray Line Handling**: The gray line at column 0 is copied from input to output unless the newly constructed colored line is placed specifically in column 3. If the new line is in column 3, the gray line is omitted from the output, leaving column 0 white.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Scan the input grid from right to left, column by column, to find the rightmost block of adjacent columns where each column consists entirely of a single non-white (0) and non-gray (5) color.\n3.  Identify the list of colors (C1, C2, ..., Ck) present in this block, reading from the leftmost column to the rightmost column of the block.\n4.  Determine the column index (`min_col`) of the leftmost column in this identified block.\n5.  Calculate the target column index for the output line: `target_col = min_col - 1`.\n6.  Populate the `target_col` in the output grid: For each row `r` from 0 to height-1, set the color of the cell at (`r`, `target_col`) to `C[(r mod k) + 1]`, where `k` is the number of colors identified in step 3. (Using 1-based indexing for colors C1..Ck temporarily for modulo arithmetic clarity, equivalent to `colors[r % k]`).\n7.  Check if the input grid contains any gray (5) pixels in column 0.\n8.  If gray pixels exist in column 0 of the input grid AND the calculated `target_col` is not equal to 3, then copy the contents of column 0 from the input grid to column 0 of the output grid.\n9.  Return the final output grid."
