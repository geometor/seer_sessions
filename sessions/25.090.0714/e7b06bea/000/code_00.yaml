objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills most of the grid initially and in the output
  - id: gray_line
    color: gray (5)
    location: always starts at (0, 0) in input, variable height
    presence: optional in input (present in all examples), conditionally present in output
  - id: colored_lines_block
    description: A contiguous block of 2 or more columns containing vertical lines of non-white, non-gray colors. Located to the right of the gray_line, separated by background. Always extends full grid height.
    properties:
      - colors: list of colors, one per column, read left-to-right
      - leftmost_column_index: the column index of the first line in the block
  - id: output_line
    description: A single vertical line in the output grid, extending full height.
    properties:
      - colors: derived by cycling through the colors of the input colored_lines_block
      - column_index: calculated based on the input colored_lines_block position

actions:
  - identify: locate the rightmost block of adjacent, non-white, non-gray vertical lines in the input.
  - extract: get the colors (C1, C2, ..., Ck) and the leftmost column index (min_col) of this block.
  - calculate_target_column: determine the output column index as `target_col = min_col - 1`.
  - create_output_grid: initialize a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
  - construct_output_line: fill the `target_col` of the output grid by cycling through C1, C2, ..., Ck row by row.
  - handle_gray_line:
      - check: if a gray_line exists at column 0 in the input.
      - condition: if `target_col` is not equal to 3.
      - copy: if the condition is true, copy the input gray_line to column 0 of the output grid.

relationships:
  - spatial: the output_line is positioned one column to the left of the input colored_lines_block's starting column.
  - conditional_preservation: the gray_line is preserved from input to output if and only if the calculated `target_col` for the output_line is not 3.
