*   **Perception:** The input grids contain a background of white (0) pixels, a single contiguous object composed of azure (8) pixels, and several individual yellow (4) pixels scattered around. The output grids consist only of white (0) and azure (8) pixels. The key transformation involves identifying the azure object, determining its shape (within its bounding box), counting the yellow pixels, and then replicating the azure object's pattern horizontally based on the count of yellow pixels. The output grid seems to have a fixed height of 3.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Replicate a pattern based on a count.
    input_elements:
      - element: background_grid
        color: 0 (white)
      - element: target_object
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: variable, contiguous
        quantity: 1
      - element: counter_pixels
        color: 4 (yellow)
        shape: single pixel
        quantity: variable (at least 1)
        role: determine repetition count
    output_elements:
      - element: background_grid
        color: 0 (white)
      - element: replicated_pattern
        color: 8 (azure) and 0 (white)
        source: derived from the bounding box of the input target_object
        repetition: horizontal tiling
        repetition_count: determined by the number of counter_pixels in the input
    grid_properties:
      input_size: variable
      output_size:
        height: fixed at 3 rows
        width: variable, depends on target_object's bounding box width and counter_pixel count
    transformation_steps:
      - 1. Identify the single contiguous azure (8) object.
      - 2. Determine the minimal bounding box containing this object.
      - 3. Extract the subgrid corresponding to this bounding box (this is the 'pattern').
      - 4. Count the total number of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid (let the count be N).
      - 5. Determine the output grid dimensions: height = 3, width = N * (pattern width).
      - 6. Create the output grid filled with white (0).
      - 7. Tile the extracted pattern horizontally N times.
      - 8. Place the tiled pattern into the output grid, aligning it to the bottom edge. (If pattern height < 3, the top rows of the output grid remain white).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Locate the contiguous block of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
    2.  Find the smallest rectangular region (bounding box) that encloses all the azure pixels.
    3.  Extract the pattern within this bounding box from the input grid, preserving the white (0) pixels within the box along with the azure pixels. Note the height (`Ph`) and width (`Pw`) of this pattern.
    4.  Count the total number of yellow (4) pixels present anywhere in the input grid. Let this count be `N`.
    5.  Prepare an output grid with a height of 3 and a width equal to `N` multiplied by `Pw`. Initialize all cells in the output grid to white (0).
    6.  Repeat the extracted pattern horizontally `N` times to create a larger, tiled pattern block.
    7.  Place this tiled pattern block into the output grid such that its bottom edge aligns with the bottom edge of the output grid. Specifically, the top row of the tiled pattern block should be placed at row `3 - Ph` of the output grid.
