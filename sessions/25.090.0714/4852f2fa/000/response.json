The output grids consist only of white (0) and azure (8) pixels. The key transformation involves identifying the azure object, determining its shape (within its bounding box), counting the yellow pixels, and then replicating the azure object's pattern horizontally based on the count of yellow pixels. The output grid seems to have a fixed height of 3.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
