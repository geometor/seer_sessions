If the pixel is white (0):\n        a.  Count its *cardinal* white neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n        b.  Count its *diagonal* white neighbors.\n        c.  Apply the following rules *in order*:\n            i.  If cardinal count = 0 AND diagonal count = 0, the output pixel is green (3).\n            ii.

This seems unlikely for ARC tasks which usually transform based on input properties.\n\n*   **Focus on the Consistent Rules:**\n    *   0 neighbors total -> Green (3).

Yes. ... etc.\n    *   Let's assign Green (3) first for all isolated white pixels.\n\n*   **Revisit Cardinal/Diagonal with Updated Grid:** What if we determine the Green pixels first, and *then* re-evaluate the neighbors for the remaining white pixels, considering the newly placed Greens as non-white? No, that violates the principle of transforming based solely on the input state.\n\n*   **Alternative Neighborhood Property:** What if it's about the *configuration* of neighbors? E.g., are the neighbors in a line? A corner?\n    *   Consider Blue (1) outputs.\n        *   `train_1`: (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,0), (8,6), (9,0), (9,1).

E.g., total number of white pixels, number of distinct white objects? Doesn't seem likely given the local nature of the changes.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 8: Rule Ordering / Specificity:** Maybe the rules need to be applied in a specific order, or some configurations take precedence.\n    *   Let's re-examine the separated counts and try to find a strict order.\n    *   (0,0) -> Green(3) [Consistent]\n    *   (0,1) -> Green(3) [Consistent]\n    *   (2,0) -> Blue(1) [Consistent]\n    *   (1,2) -> Blue(1) [Consistent]\n    *   (1,3) -> Blue(1) [Consistent]\n    *   (2,1) -> Blue(1) [Consistent]\n    *   The ambiguities are only for (1,0) and (1,1).\n    *   (1,0): {2} (train1), {2} (train2), {1, 2} (train3).

This matches rule (1,2)->Blue(1).

If (C,D) == (2,1) -> Blue (1)\n    7.  All remaining white pixels become Red (2). (This would cover (1,0) and (1,1), and any other combinations not seen).\n\n*   Let's test this simplified rule set.\n    *   Case (1,0): Should become Red(2).\n        *   `train_1`: Output is Red(2). Correct.\n        *   `train_2`: Output is Red(2). Correct.\n        *   `train_3`: Output is {1, 2}. Rule predicts Red(2). Incorrect for the cases where it's Blue(1).\n    *   Case (1,1): Should become Red(2).\n        *   `train_1`: Output is {1, 2}. Rule predicts Red(2). Incorrect for Blue(1) cases.\n        *   `train_2`: Output is {1}. Rule predicts Red(2). Incorrect.\n        *   `train_3`: Output is {2}. Rule predicts Red(2). Correct.\n\n*   This simple default rule doesn't work. The distinction between Blue(1) and Red(2) for the (1,0) and (1,1) cases must depend on something else.\n\n*   **Final attempt: Look at the colors assigned by the *consistent* rules first.**\n    *   Assign Green(3) for (0,0) and (0,1).\n    *   Assign Blue(1) for (2,0), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1).\n    *   Now, for the remaining white pixels (which must have (C,D) counts of (1,0) or (1,1)), determine their color. Does the color depend on the *already assigned* neighbor colors? No, shouldn't work like that.\n\n*   Think about the colors: Blue=1, Red=2, Green=3. Does it relate to the counts?\n    *   Green (3) comes from low neighbor counts (0,0) and (0,1). Total 0 or 1 neighbor.\n    *   Blue (1) comes from higher neighbor counts (2,0), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1). Total 2, 3, 4 neighbors.\n    *   Red (2) seems to be in the middle, associated with (1,0) and (1,1). Total 1 or 2 neighbors.\n\n    *   Rule Proposal:\n        1. Calculate (Cardinal, Diagonal) white neighbors = (C, D).\n        2. Calculate Total white neighbors T = C + D.\n        3. If T = 0 -> Green (3) // Covers (0,0)\n        4. If T = 1: // Covers (1,0) and (0,1)\n            If (C,D) == (0,1) -> Green (3)\n            If (C,D) == (1,0) -> Red (2) // Base assumption for T=1\n        5. If T = 2: // Covers (2,0), (1,1), (0,2) - (0,2) not seen\n            If (C,D) == (2,0) -> Blue (1)\n            If (C,D) == (1,1) -> Red (2) // Base assumption for T=2?\n        6. If T >= 3: -> Blue (1) // Covers (1,2), (1,3), (2,1) and potentially others\n\n    *   Let's test this:\n        *   (0,0) T=0 -> Green(3). Correct.\n        *   (0,1) T=1 -> Green(3). Correct.\n        *   (1,0) T=1 -> Red(2).\n            *   `train_1`: Output {2}. Correct.\n            *   `train_2`: Output {2}. Correct.\n            *   `train_3`: Output {1, 2}.

Incorrect for Blue(1) cases.\n            *   `train_2`: Output {1}. Incorrect.\n            *   `train_3`: Output {2}. Correct.\n        *   (1,2) T=3 -> Blue(1). Correct.\n        *   (1,3) T=4 -> Blue(1). Correct.\n        *   (2,1) T=3 -> Blue(1). Correct.\n\n*   The conflict still lies in (1,0) and (1,1) sometimes yielding Blue(1) instead of Red(2). What makes those specific pixels different? It's not just the local neighbor counts.\n\n*   Is it related to the *position* of the neighbors?\n    *   E.g., for (1,0), is the single cardinal neighbor Up/Down vs Left/Right?\n    *   E.g., for (1,1), is the cardinal neighbor opposite the diagonal one?\n\n*   Let's define the neighbor types: N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW.\n    *   Consider `train_3`, Input(1,8)=0 -> Blue(1). (C,D)=(1,0). Neighbor is (0,8)=0 (N).\n    *   Consider `train_3`, Input(5,2)=0 -> Red(2). (C,D)=(1,0). Neighbor is (6,2)=0 (S).\n    *   Consider `train_1`, Input(0,6)=0 -> Red(2). (C,D)=(1,0). Neighbor is (1,6)=0 (S).\n    *   Consider `train_2`, Input(5,0)=0 -> Red(2). (C,D)=(1,0). Neighbor is (6,0)=0 (S).\n    *   Consider `train_2`, Input(6,0)=0 -> Red(2). (C,D)=(1,0). Neighbor is (5,0)=0 (N).\n    *   Rule based on neighbor position for (1,0) doesn't seem consistent.\n\n    *   Consider `train_2`, Input(3,7)=0 -> Blue(1). (C,D)=(1,1). Neighbors: (2,7)=0 (N), (2,8)=5, (3,6)=5, (3,8)=0 (E), (4,6)=5, (4,7)=5, (4,8)=5. Ah, input grid is wrong. Let's use the code output. train_2, (1,1) -> Blue(1). Which pixels are these?\n        *   Input(2,6)=0. Neighbors: (1,6)=5, (3,6)=5, (2,5)=5, (2,7)=0 (E). Diag: (1,5)=5, (1,7)=0 (NE), (3,5)=0 (SW), (3,7)=0 (SE). Output=1 (Blue). (C,D)=(1,3)? Code said (1,1). Code must be wrong? Let's re-run code with debug print.\n\n"
