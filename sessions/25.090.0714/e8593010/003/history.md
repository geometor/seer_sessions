*   *Observation:* The mapping from the number of white neighbors to the output color is inconsistent across examples and even within `train_1` and `train_3`. For instance, in `train_1`, 1 neighbor maps to both red (2) and green (3). In `train_2`, 1 neighbor maps only to red (2). In `train_3`, 1 neighbor maps to blue (1), red (2), and green (3). This hypothesis is incorrect.

*   **Hypothesis 6: Separate Neighbor Counts (Cardinal vs Diagonal):** Maybe cardinal (up, down, left, right) and diagonal neighbors are counted differently or have different weights.
    *   Let's try counting cardinal white neighbors and diagonal white neighbors separately.

```
*   *Observation:* This separation still doesn't yield a consistent mapping. For example:
    *   In `train_1`, (1,1) maps to blue (1) and red (2).
    *   In `train_2`, (1,1) maps to blue (1).
    *   In `train_1`, (0,0) maps to green (3).
    *   In `train_2`, (0,0) maps to green (3).
    *   In `train_3`, (0,0) maps to green (3). --> This one is consistent: 0 cardinal, 0 diagonal white neighbors -> green (3).
    *   In `train_1`, (1,0) maps to red (2).
    *   In `train_2`, (1,0) maps to red (2).
    *   In `train_3`, (1,0) maps to blue (1) and red (2). --> Inconsistent again.
    *   In `train_1`, (2,0) maps to blue (1).
    *   In `train_2`, (2,0) maps to blue (1).
    *   In `train_3`, (2,0) maps to blue (1). --> Consistent: 2 cardinal, 0 diagonal white neighbors -> blue (1).

*   **Refined Hypothesis (Based on Consistent Findings):**
    *   If a white pixel has exactly 0 white neighbors (cardinal or diagonal), it becomes green (3).
    *   If a white pixel has exactly 2 *cardinal* white neighbors and 0 *diagonal* white neighbors, it becomes blue (1).
    *   What about red (2)? Let's look at the remaining cases where the output is red.
        *   `train_1`: (1,0) -> (1,0) maps to red; (1,1) -> (1,1) maps to red.
        *   `train_2`: (1,0) -> (1,0) maps to red.
        *   `train_3`: (1,0) -> (1,0) maps to red; (1,1) -> (1,1) maps to red.
    *   It seems if a white pixel has exactly 1 *cardinal* white neighbor (regardless of diagonal count?), it becomes red (2).
        *   Let's check this:
            *   `train_1`: (1,0) -> red (2). Consistent. (1,1) has 1 cardinal, 1 diagonal -> red (2). Consistent.
            *   `train_2`: (1,0) -> red (2). Consistent.
            *   `train_3`: (1,0) -> red (2). Consistent. (1,1) -> red (2). Consistent.

*   **Consolidated Hypothesis:**
    1.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
    2.  If the pixel is gray (5), keep it gray (5) in the output.
    3.  If the pixel is white (0):
        a.  Count its *cardinal* white neighbors (up, down, left, right).
        b.  Count its *diagonal* white neighbors.
        c.  Apply the following rules *in order*:
            i.  If cardinal count = 0 AND diagonal count = 0, the output pixel is green (3).
            ii. Else if cardinal count = 2 AND diagonal count = 0, the output pixel is blue (1).
            iii. Else if cardinal count = 1, the output pixel is red (2).
            iv.  What about other cases? Let's re-examine the mappings.
                *   `train_1`: (0,1) diag=1 -> green(3). (1,2) card=1,diag=2 -> blue(1). My rules don't cover these.
                *   `train_2`: (1,1) card=1,diag=1 -> blue(1). My rules say red(2). Contradiction.
                *   `train_3`: (0,1) diag=1 -> green(3). (1,3) card=1,diag=3 -> blue(1). (2,1) card=2,diag=1 -> blue(1). (1,2) card=1,diag=2 -> blue(1). My rules don't cover these or contradict.

*   **Backtrack - Total Neighbor Count Again:** Let's look at the *total* number of white neighbors again, maybe the initial inconsistency was just bad luck or I misread.
    *   `train_1`: {1: {2, 3}, 0: {3}, 2: {1, 2}, 3: {1}}
    *   `train_2`: {0: {3}, 2: {1}, 1: {2}}
    *   `train_3`: {1: {1, 2, 3}, 2: {1, 2}, 4: {1}, 3: {1}, 0: {3}}

    *   Okay, the total count alone is definitely not enough.

*   **Consider the *Output* Neighborhood:** Maybe the color depends on the neighbors in the *output* grid? This seems unlikely for ARC tasks which usually transform based on input properties.

*   **Focus on the Consistent Rules:**
    *   0 neighbors total -> Green (3). This holds for all examples.
        *   `train_1`: Input(1,3) -> Output(1,3)=3. Neighbors=0. Yes. Input(4,8) -> Output(4,8)=3. Neighbors=0. Yes. ... etc.
        *   `train_2`: Input(0,4) -> Output(0,4)=3. Neighbors=0. Yes. Input(0,8) -> Output(0,8)=3. Neighbors=0. Yes. ... etc.
        *   `train_3`: Input(0,4) -> Output(0,4)=3. Neighbors=0. Yes. Input(2,5) -> Output(2,5)=3. Neighbors=0. Yes. ... etc.
    *   Let's assign Green (3) first for all isolated white pixels.

*   **Revisit Cardinal/Diagonal with Updated Grid:** What if we determine the Green pixels first, and *then* re-evaluate the neighbors for the remaining white pixels, considering the newly placed Greens as non-white? No, that violates the principle of transforming based solely on the input state.

*   **Alternative Neighborhood Property:** What if it's about the *configuration* of neighbors? E.g., are the neighbors in a line? A corner?
    *   Consider Blue (1) outputs.
        *   `train_1`: (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,0), (8,6), (9,0), (9,1). Let's check neighbors for Input(6,6)=0: (5,5)=0, (6,5)=0, (7,5)=X, (5,6)=X, (7,6)=0, (5,7)=X, (6,7)=0, (7,7)=0. Total=5 neighbors.
        *   Input(8,0)=0: (7,0)=X, (9,0)=0, (8,1)=X, (7,1)=X, (9,1)=0. Total=2 neighbors.
    *   Consider Red (2) outputs.
        *   `train_1`: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (0,6), (0,7), (2,6), (2,8), (2,9), (3,5), (5,4), (6,0), (6,1), (6,4). Let's check neighbors for Input(0,0)=0: (0,1)=0, (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0. Total=3 neighbors.
        *   Input(3,5)=0: (2,4)=X, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=X, (3,4)=X, (3,6)=X, (4,4)=X, (4,5)=X, (4,6)=X. Total=1 neighbor.

*   **Let's try the total neighbor counts again, but map systematically:**
    *   Neighbors = 0 -> Green (3) [Seems solid]
    *   Neighbors = 1 -> ?
        *   `train_1`: Input(3,5) has 1 neighbor (2,5=0). Output(3,5)=2 (Red).
        *   `train_1`: Input(6,4) has 1 neighbor (5,4=0). Output(6,4)=2 (Red).
        *   `train_2`: Input(3,7) has 1 neighbor (2,7=0). Output(3,7)=1 (Blue).
        *   `train_2`: Input(4,4) has 1 neighbor (4,5=0). Output(4,4)=2 (Red).
        *   `train_2`: Input(4,5) has 1 neighbor (4,4=0). Output(4,5)=2 (Red).
        *   `train_3`: Input(3,4) has 1 neighbor (4,4=0). Output(3,4)=1 (Blue).
        *   `train_3`: Input(4,3) has 1 neighbor (4,4=0). Output(4,3)=1 (Blue).
        *   `train_3`: Input(4,7) has 1 neighbor (4,6)=X? No, (5,7)=0. Output(4,7)=2 (Red).
        *   `train_3`: Input(5,7) has 1 neighbor (4,7)=0. Output(5,7)=2 (Red).
        *   Okay, total neighbors = 1 maps inconsistently to Red(2) or Blue(1).
    *   Neighbors = 2 -> ?
        *   `train_1`: Input(1,9) has 2 neighbors (0,9=0, 2,9=0). Output(1,9)=3 (Green). -> Contradicts the "0 neighbors -> Green" rule? Let's recheck Input(1,9). Neighbors are (0,8)=5, (0,9)=0, (1,8)=5, (2,8)=0, (2,9)=0. Wait, 3 neighbors. My manual count was wrong. Let's trust the code.
        *   Let's re-evaluate based on the code's counts:
            *   `train_1`: {1: {2, 3}, 0: {3}, 2: {1, 2}, 3: {1}}
            *   `train_2`: {0: {3}, 2: {1}, 1: {2}}
            *   `train_3`: {1: {1, 2, 3}, 2: {1, 2}, 4: {1}, 3: {1}, 0: {3}}

    *   Let's consolidate the mappings across all examples:
        *   Count 0 -> {3} (Consistent Green)
        *   Count 1 -> {2, 3} (train1), {2} (train2), {1, 2, 3} (train3). Overall: {1, 2, 3}
        *   Count 2 -> {1, 2} (train1), {1} (train2), {1, 2} (train3). Overall: {1, 2}
        *   Count 3 -> {1} (train1), {1} (train3). Overall: {1} (Consistent Blue)
        *   Count 4 -> {1} (train3). Overall: {1} (Consistent Blue)

    *   Revised Hypothesis (based on total white neighbors):
        1.  Count the total number (0-8) of white neighbors for each white pixel.
        2.  If count = 0, output is Green (3).
        3.  If count = 3 or count = 4, output is Blue (1).
        4.  If count = 1, output can be Blue (1), Red (2), or Green (3).
        5.  If count = 2, output can be Blue (1) or Red (2).

    *   This is still ambiguous for counts 1 and 2. There must be another factor. Let's revisit the cardinal/diagonal separation.
        *   Cardinal / Diagonal mappings consolidated:
            *   (0,0) -> {3} (Consistent Green)
            *   (0,1) -> {3} (train1), {3} (train3). Overall: {3} (Consistent Green)
            *   (1,0) -> {2} (train1), {2} (train2), {1, 2} (train3). Overall: {1, 2}
            *   (1,1) -> {1, 2} (train1), {1} (train2), {2} (train3). Overall: {1, 2}
            *   (2,0) -> {1} (train1), {1} (train2), {1} (train3). Overall: {1} (Consistent Blue)
            *   (1,2) -> {1} (train1), {1} (train3). Overall: {1} (Consistent Blue)
            *   (1,3) -> {1} (train3). Overall: {1} (Consistent Blue)
            *   (2,1) -> {1} (train3). Overall: {1} (Consistent Blue)

    *   New Consolidated Hypothesis (Cardinal/Diagonal):
        1.  If (Cardinal, Diagonal) = (0,0) -> Green (3)
        2.  If (Cardinal, Diagonal) = (0,1) -> Green (3)
        3.  If (Cardinal, Diagonal) = (2,0) -> Blue (1)
        4.  If (Cardinal, Diagonal) = (1,2) -> Blue (1)
        5.  If (Cardinal, Diagonal) = (1,3) -> Blue (1)
        6.  If (Cardinal, Diagonal) = (2,1) -> Blue (1)
        7.  If (Cardinal, Diagonal) = (1,0) -> Blue (1) or Red (2)
        8.  If (Cardinal, Diagonal) = (1,1) -> Blue (1) or Red (2)

    *   Still ambiguous for (1,0) and (1,1). What distinguishes Blue from Red in these cases?
        *   Look at (1,0) cases:
            *   `train_1`, Input(0,6)=0. Neighbors: (0,5)=5, (1,5)=5, (1,6)=0. Cardinal=1 ((1,6)), Diagonal=0. Output(0,6)=2 (Red).
            *   `train_1`, Input(3,1)=0. Neighbors: (2,0)=5, (2,1)=5, (2,2)=5, (3,0)=5, (3,2)=5, (4,0)=5, (4,1)=5, (4,2)=5. No white neighbors. Wait, input(3,1) is 0. Neighbors: (2,1)=5, (4,1)=5, (3,0)=5, (3,2)=5. Diagonals: (2,0)=5, (2,2)=5, (4,0)=5, (4,2)=5. Ah, input(3,1) is 0. Its output is 3 (green). It has 0 neighbors. This fits rule (1).
            *   Where did the code get (1,0) -> Red (2) for train_1? Let's re-run the check manually for a point that resulted in Red(2).
            *   `train_1`, Input(0,6)=0. Output(0,6)=2(Red). Neighbors: Cardinal: (1,6)=0. Diagonal: None. Count=(1,0).
            *   `train_1`, Input(0,7)=0. Output(0,7)=2(Red). Neighbors: Cardinal: (1,7)=5, (0,6)=0. Diagonal: (1,6)=0, (1,8)=5. Count=(1,1). My code output says (1,1) -> {1,2}. Output is 2.
            *   `train_1`, Input(2,6)=0. Output(2,6)=2(Red). Neighbors: Cardinal: (1,6)=0, (3,6)=0. Diagonal: (1,5)=5, (1,7)=5, (3,5)=0, (3,7)=5. Count=(2,1). My code output says (2,1) is not possible in train_1. ERROR in my manual check or the code? Let's recheck Input(2,6)=0 manually. N: (1,6)=0, (3,6)=0, (2,5)=0, (2,7)=5. D: (1,5)=5, (1,7)=5, (3,5)=0, (3,7)=5. Cardinal count = 3? (1,6), (3,6), (2,5). Diagonal count = 1? (3,5). Total 4 neighbors. Output=2(Red). My code doesn't list 4 neighbors for train_1.

Let's rerun the count code, maybe I pasted something wrong.

```
*   *Observation:* The code output is consistent with the previous run. My manual check for Input(2,6) in train_1 was incorrect. Let's trust the code. The issue remains: the mappings are ambiguous based on neighbor counts alone (total or separated).

*   **Hypothesis 7: Global Property?** Is there a global property affecting the choice between colors when counts are ambiguous? E.g., total number of white pixels, number of distinct white objects? Doesn't seem likely given the local nature of the changes.

*   **Hypothesis 8: Rule Ordering / Specificity:** Maybe the rules need to be applied in a specific order, or some configurations take precedence.
    *   Let's re-examine the separated counts and try to find a strict order.
    *   (0,0) -> Green(3) [Consistent]
    *   (0,1) -> Green(3) [Consistent]
    *   (2,0) -> Blue(1) [Consistent]
    *   (1,2) -> Blue(1) [Consistent]
    *   (1,3) -> Blue(1) [Consistent]
    *   (2,1) -> Blue(1) [Consistent]
    *   The ambiguities are only for (1,0) and (1,1).
    *   (1,0): {2} (train1), {2} (train2), {1, 2} (train3). Output is usually Red(2), but can be Blue(1) in train3.
    *   (1,1): {1, 2} (train1), {1} (train2), {2} (train3). Output can be Blue(1) or Red(2).

    *   Maybe Red(2) is the default for (1,0) and (1,1), unless some other condition makes it Blue(1)? What's special about the (1,0) case in train3 that becomes Blue(1)?
        *   `train_3`, Input(1,8)=0. Output(1,8)=1(Blue). Neighbors: Cardinal: (0,8)=0. Diagonal: None. Count=(1,0).
        *   `train_3`, Input(2,3)=0. Output(2,3)=1(Blue). Neighbors: Cardinal: (1,3)=0. Diagonal: None. Count=(1,0).
        *   `train_3`, Input(3,4)=0. Output(3,4)=1(Blue). Neighbors: Cardinal: (4,4)=0. Diagonal: None. Count=(1,0).
        *   `train_3`, Input(4,3)=0. Output(4,3)=1(Blue). Neighbors: Cardinal: (4,4)=0. Diagonal: None. Count=(1,0).
        *   Compare to a (1,0) case that becomes Red(2) in `train_3`:
        *   `train_3`, Input(5,2)=0. Output(5,2)=2(Red). Neighbors: Cardinal: (6,2)=0. Diagonal: None. Count=(1,0).
        *   `train_3`, Input(6,2)=0. Output(6,2)=2(Red). Neighbors: Cardinal: (5,2)=0. Diagonal: None. Count=(1,0).
        *   `train_3`, Input(4,7)=0. Output(4,7)=2(Red). Neighbors: Cardinal: (5,7)=0. Diagonal: None. Count=(1,0).
        *   `train_3`, Input(5,7)=0. Output(5,7)=2(Red). Neighbors: Cardinal: (4,7)=0. Diagonal: None. Count=(1,0).

        *   Is there something about the single neighbor? No obvious pattern.

    *   What about the (1,1) cases?
        *   `train_1`, Input(0,7)=0 -> Red(2). N=(1,1).
        *   `train_1`, Input(6,7)=0 -> Blue(1). N=(1,1).
        *   `train_1`, Input(7,7)=0 -> Blue(1). N=(1,1).
        *   `train_2`, Input(2,6)=0 -> Blue(1). N=(1,1).
        *   `train_2`, Input(2,7)=0 -> Blue(1). N=(1,1).
        *   `train_2`, Input(3,7)=0 -> Blue(1). N=(1,1).
        *   `train_3`, Input(0,1)=0 -> Red(2). N=(1,1).
        *   `train_3`, Input(1,3)=0 -> Blue(1). N=(1,1)? Let's check `train_3`, Input(1,3)=0. N: C=(1,2)=0, D=(0,2)=5, (0,4)=0, (2,2)=5, (2,4)=0. Card=1, Diag=2. Output=1(Blue). This matches rule (1,2)->Blue(1). My analysis of (1,1) was flawed.

*   Let's retry the specific rules based ONLY on the consistent findings from the code output analysis across all 3 examples:
    1.  If (C,D) == (0,0) -> Green (3)
    2.  If (C,D) == (0,1) -> Green (3)
    3.  If (C,D) == (2,0) -> Blue (1)
    4.  If (C,D) == (1,2) -> Blue (1)
    5.  If (C,D) == (1,3) -> Blue (1)
    6.  If (C,D) == (2,1) -> Blue (1)
    7.  All remaining white pixels become Red (2). (This would cover (1,0) and (1,1), and any other combinations not seen).

*   Let's test this simplified rule set.
    *   Case (1,0): Should become Red(2).
        *   `train_1`: Output is Red(2). Correct.
        *   `train_2`: Output is Red(2). Correct.
        *   `train_3`: Output is {1, 2}. Rule predicts Red(2). Incorrect for the cases where it's Blue(1).
    *   Case (1,1): Should become Red(2).
        *   `train_1`: Output is {1, 2}. Rule predicts Red(2). Incorrect for Blue(1) cases.
        *   `train_2`: Output is {1}. Rule predicts Red(2). Incorrect.
        *   `train_3`: Output is {2}. Rule predicts Red(2). Correct.

*   This simple default rule doesn't work. The distinction between Blue(1) and Red(2) for the (1,0) and (1,1) cases must depend on something else.

*   **Final attempt: Look at the colors assigned by the *consistent* rules first.**
    *   Assign Green(3) for (0,0) and (0,1).
    *   Assign Blue(1) for (2,0), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1).
    *   Now, for the remaining white pixels (which must have (C,D) counts of (1,0) or (1,1)), determine their color. Does the color depend on the *already assigned* neighbor colors? No, shouldn't work like that.

*   Think about the colors: Blue=1, Red=2, Green=3. Does it relate to the counts?
    *   Green (3) comes from low neighbor counts (0,0) and (0,1). Total 0 or 1 neighbor.
    *   Blue (1) comes from higher neighbor counts (2,0), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1). Total 2, 3, 4 neighbors.
    *   Red (2) seems to be in the middle, associated with (1,0) and (1,1). Total 1 or 2 neighbors.

    *   Rule Proposal:
        1. Calculate (Cardinal, Diagonal) white neighbors = (C, D).
        2. Calculate Total white neighbors T = C + D.
        3. If T = 0 -> Green (3) // Covers (0,0)
        4. If T = 1: // Covers (1,0) and (0,1)
            If (C,D) == (0,1) -> Green (3)
            If (C,D) == (1,0) -> Red (2) // Base assumption for T=1
        5. If T = 2: // Covers (2,0), (1,1), (0,2) - (0,2) not seen
            If (C,D) == (2,0) -> Blue (1)
            If (C,D) == (1,1) -> Red (2) // Base assumption for T=2?
        6. If T >= 3: -> Blue (1) // Covers (1,2), (1,3), (2,1) and potentially others

    *   Let's test this:
        *   (0,0) T=0 -> Green(3). Correct.

        *   (1,3) T=4 -> Blue(1). Correct.
        *   (2,1) T=3 -> Blue(1). Correct.

*   The conflict still lies in (1,0) and (1,1) sometimes yielding Blue(1) instead of Red(2). What makes those specific pixels different? It's not just the local neighbor counts.

*   Is it related to the *position* of the neighbors?
    *   E.g., for (1,0), is the single cardinal neighbor Up/Down vs Left/Right?
    *   E.g., for (1,1), is the cardinal neighbor opposite the diagonal one?

*   Let's define the neighbor types: N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW.
    *   Consider `train_3`, Input(1,8)=0 -> Blue(1). (C,D)=(1,0). Neighbor is (0,8)=0 (N).
    *   Consider `train_3`, Input(5,2)=0 -> Red(2). (C,D)=(1,0). Neighbor is (6,2)=0 (S).
    *   Consider `train_1`, Input(0,6)=0 -> Red(2). (C,D)=(1,0). Neighbor is (1,6)=0 (S).
    *   Consider `train_2`, Input(5,0)=0 -> Red(2). (C,D)=(1,0). Neighbor is (6,0)=0 (S).
    *   Consider `train_2`, Input(6,0)=0 -> Red(2). (C,D)=(1,0). Neighbor is (5,0)=0 (N).
    *   Rule based on neighbor position for (1,0) doesn't seem consistent.

    *   Consider `train_2`, Input(3,7)=0 -> Blue(1). (C,D)=(1,1). Neighbors: (2,7)=0 (N), (2,8)=5, (3,6)=5, (3,8)=0 (E), (4,6)=5, (4,7)=5, (4,8)=5. Ah, input grid is wrong. Let's use the code output. train_2, (1,1) -> Blue(1). Which pixels are these?
        *   Input(2,6)=0. Neighbors: (1,6)=5, (3,6)=5, (2,5)=5, (2,7)=0 (E). Diag: (1,5)=5, (1,7)=0 (NE), (3,5)=0 (SW), (3,7)=0 (SE). Output=1 (Blue). (C,D)=(1,3)? Code said (1,1). Code must be wrong? Let's re-run code with debug print.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial hypothesis correctly identified that the transformation applies only to white (0) pixels and depends on the counts of cardinal (C) and diagonal (D) white neighbors. Several specific (C, D) count combinations were consistently mapped to Green (3) or Blue (1) across all examples. However, the rule assigning Red (2) as the default for all other combinations, particularly for (C,D) = (1,0) and (C,D) = (1,1), proved incorrect. These combinations sometimes result in Blue (1) instead of Red (2).

The strategy is to analyze the specific pixels where the prediction failed in each training example. By examining the input configuration (specifically the (C,D) counts) for these failed pixels and comparing them to pixels with the same (C,D) counts that were correctly predicted, we can identify the missing condition or refinement needed to distinguish when (1,0) or (1,1) should result in Blue (1) versus Red (2).

## Metrics and Error Analysis

We will analyze the discrepancies between the expected output and the output generated by the previous code (`code_00.py`) for each training example, focusing on pixels where the input was white (0).

## Findings from Error Analysis

1.  **Consistent Rules Hold:** The rules identified as consistent previously still hold:
    *   (0,0) -> Green(3)
    *   (0,1) -> Green(3)
    *   (2,0) -> Blue(1) (Note: T2 (1,0) was misidentified in checks; its counts are (2,0), expected Blue(1), but previous code predicted Red(2). The rule (2,0)->Blue(1) is correct, but the code logic applied the default Red(2) incorrectly).
    *   (1,2) -> Blue(1)
    *   (1,3) -> Blue(1)
    *   (2,1) -> Blue(1)

2.  **Error Source:** All errors where the prediction was Red(2) but the expectation was Blue(1) occurred when the neighbor counts (C,D) were either **(1,1)** or **(1,0)**.

3.  **Refined Rule Needed:** The core task is to differentiate when (1,1) and (1,0) should yield Blue(1) versus Red(2). The previous code defaulted these to Red(2).

4.  **New Hypothesis:** Let's check if there's a simple logic switch. Maybe (1,1) should always be Blue(1) and (1,0) should always be Red(2)?
    *   Test (1,1) -> Blue(1):
        *   `train_1`: Pixels (6,6), (8,0), (9,1) are expected Blue(1). This matches. Pixel (0,7) is expected Red(2). This contradicts.
        *   `train_2`: Pixels (1,1), (2,0), (2,6), (3,7) are expected Blue(1). This matches.
        *   `train_3`: Pixel (0,1) is expected Red(2). This contradicts.
    *   Test (1,0) -> Red(2):
        *   `train_1`: Pixel (0,6) etc. are expected Red(2). This matches.
        *   `train_2`: Pixel (5,0) etc. are expected Red(2). This matches.
        *   `train_3`: Pixels (0,8), (2,8) are expected Blue(1). This contradicts. Pixels (5,2), (6,2) etc. are expected Red(2). This matches.

5.  **Conclusion:** A simple switch based only on the (C,D) pair (1,1) or (1,0) is insufficient. There must be another condition. However, given the complexity and the failure of local neighbourhood analysis, the simplest explanation might be that the default rule was applied incorrectly or inconsistently in the previous attempt. Let's re-establish the rule set cleanly based on the *consistent* findings and apply the Red(2) default carefully.

      - default_rule (hypothesis): All other white pixels -> output_color: 2 (Red)

uncertainty: >
  The exact condition distinguishing between Blue(1) and Red(2) output for
  neighbor counts (1,0) and (1,1) is not fully resolved by local neighbor counts alone.
  The simplest hypothesis is that the default is Red(2), but this failed testing.
  Revisiting implementation of the default logic is needed.

## Natural Language Program (Revised)

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) at position (row, column) of the input grid.
3.  **Check Pixel Color:** If the color of the input pixel at (row, column) is not white (0), skip to the next pixel (the output pixel retains its copied value).
4.  **Count Neighbors:** If the input pixel is white (0), count its white neighbors:
    *   Count the number of cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) that are white. Let this be C.
    *   Count the number of diagonal neighbors that are white. Let this be D.
5.  **Apply Transformation Rules:** Determine the output color based on the counts (C, D) using the following specific rules, checked in order:
    *   If C=0 and D=0, set the output pixel at (row, column) to Green (3).
    *   Else if C=0 and D=1, set the output pixel at (row, column) to Green (3).
    *   Else if C=2 and D=0, set the output pixel at (row, column) to Blue (1).
    *   Else if C=1 and D=2, set the output pixel at (row, column) to Blue (1).
    *   Else if C=1 and D=3, set the output pixel at (row, column) to Blue (1).
    *   Else if C=2 and D=1, set the output pixel at (row, column) to Blue (1).
    *   **Default Rule:** Else (for any other combination of C and D, including (1,0) and (1,1)), set the output pixel at (row, column) to Red (2).
6.  After iterating through all input pixels, return the modified output grid.
