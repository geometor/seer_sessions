"""
Transforms the input grid based on the neighborhood of white pixels.

The transformation rule applies specifically to white pixels (value 0) in the input grid. Gray pixels (value 5) remain unchanged.
For each white pixel, its cardinal (up, down, left, right) and diagonal white neighbors are counted.
The output color for that pixel's position is determined by the counts (Cardinal, Diagonal) according to the following rules:

1. If (Cardinal, Diagonal) == (0, 0), the output pixel is Green (3).
2. If (Cardinal, Diagonal) == (0, 1), the output pixel is Green (3).
3. If (Cardinal, Diagonal) == (2, 0), the output pixel is Blue (1).
4. If (Cardinal, Diagonal) == (1, 2), the output pixel is Blue (1).
5. If (Cardinal, Diagonal) == (1, 3), the output pixel is Blue (1).
6. If (Cardinal, Diagonal) == (2, 1), the output pixel is Blue (1).
7. For all other combinations of (Cardinal, Diagonal) counts for a white pixel (primarily (1,0) and (1,1) observed in examples), the output pixel is Red (2).
