Gray pixels (value 5) remain unchanged.\nFor each white pixel, its cardinal (up, down, left, right) and diagonal white neighbors are counted.\nThe output color for that pixel's position is determined by the counts (Cardinal, Diagonal) according to the following rules:\n\n1. If (Cardinal, Diagonal) == (0, 0), the output pixel is Green (3).\n2. If (Cardinal, Diagonal) == (0, 1), the output pixel is Green (3).\n3. If (Cardinal, Diagonal) == (2, 0), the output pixel is Blue (1).\n4. If (Cardinal, Diagonal) == (1, 2), the output pixel is Blue (1).\n5. If (Cardinal, Diagonal) == (1, 3), the output pixel is Blue (1).\n6. If (Cardinal, Diagonal) == (2, 1), the output pixel is Blue (1).\n7.
