Gray pixels remain unchanged. \n\nThe transformation rule for a white pixel is determined by counting its \ncardinal (adjacent) and diagonal white neighbors:\n- Let C be the count of cardinal white neighbors.\n- Let D be the count of diagonal white neighbors.\n\nThe output color for the white pixel's position is assigned based on the \n(C, D) tuple according to the following specific rules:\n1. If (C, D) == (0, 0) -> Green (3)\n2. If (C, D) == (0, 1) -> Green (3)\n3. If (C, D) == (2, 0) -> Blue (1)\n4. If (C, D) == (1, 2) -> Blue (1)\n5. If (C, D) == (1, 3) -> Blue (1) (Observed in train_3)\n6. If (C, D) == (2, 1) -> Blue (1) (Observed in train_3)\n7. For all other combinations of (C, D) for a white pixel, the default \n   output color is Red (2). This includes the cases (1,0) and (1,1), \n   which were observed in the training examples to sometimes result in Blue (1)\n   instead. The specific condition distinguishing Blue(1) from Red(2) for \n   these counts is not captured by this rule set and remains an unresolved factor.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef count_neighbors_separated(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts cardinal and diagonal neighbors of a specific color (0 - white) \n    for a given cell (r, c) in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        r (int): Row index of the cell.\n        c (int): Column index of the cell.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (cardinal_count, diagonal_count) of white neighbors.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    cardinal_count = 0\n    diagonal_count = 0\n    target_color = 0 # We are only interested in white neighbors\n\n    # Iterate through the 3x3 neighborhood centered at (r, c)\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            # Skip the cell itself\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue\n\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n            # Check if the neighbor coordinates are within the grid bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                # Check if the neighbor pixel is the target color (white)\n                if grid[nr, nc] == target_color:\n                    # Determine if the neighbor is cardinal or diagonal\n                    if abs(dr) + abs(dc) == 1: # Cardinal (N, S, E, W)\n                        cardinal_count += 1\n                    else: # Diagonal (NE, NW, SE, SW)\n                        diagonal_count += 1\n                        \n    return cardinal_count, diagonal_count\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule based on white neighbor counts to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to a numpy array for efficient processing\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    rows, cols = input_grid_np.shape\n    \n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid. \n    # Non-white pixels will retain their original color unless changed by the rules.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid_np)\n\n    # Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Check if the current pixel is white (color 0)\n            if input_grid_np[r, c] == 0:\n                # Count the cardinal (C) and diagonal (D) white neighbors\n                cardinal_neighbors, diagonal_neighbors = count_neighbors_separated(input_grid_np, r, c)\n                \n                # Apply the transformation rules based on the (C, D) counts\n                # Note: These rules are applied sequentially; the first match determines the color.\n                if cardinal_neighbors == 0 and diagonal_neighbors == 0:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 3 # Green\n                elif cardinal_neighbors == 0 and diagonal_neighbors == 1:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 3 # Green\n                elif cardinal_neighbors == 2 and diagonal_neighbors == 0:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 1 # Blue\n                elif cardinal_neighbors == 1 and diagonal_neighbors == 2:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 1 # Blue\n                elif cardinal_neighbors == 1 and diagonal_neighbors == 3:\n                    # This rule was derived from train_3 analysis\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 1 # Blue \n                elif cardinal_neighbors == 2 and diagonal_neighbors == 1:\n                    # This rule was derived from train_3 analysis\n                     output_grid[r, c] = 1 # Blue\n                else:\n                    # Default case for all other combinations not explicitly listed above.\n                    # This includes (C=1, D=0) and (C=1, D=1). \n                    # IMPORTANT: Analysis showed this default is incorrect for some instances \n                    # where (1,0) or (1,1) should yield Blue(1), but the distinguishing \n                    # factor is unknown.
