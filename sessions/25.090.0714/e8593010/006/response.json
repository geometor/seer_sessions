            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial transformation code failed because it relied on an incomplete set of rules derived primarily from the first example and made an incorrect assumption about the default color for ambiguous neighbor counts. Specifically, the counts of (Cardinal=1, Diagonal=0) and (Cardinal=1, Diagonal=1) sometimes resulted in Blue (1) and sometimes Red (2) in the examples, but the code defaulted them to Red (2). Additionally, some neighbor count combinations like (2,2) and (3,1) were encountered in later examples, mapping to Blue (1), which were not covered by the initial rules and defaulted incorrectly to Red (2).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-analyze the relationship between the Cardinal/Diagonal neighbor counts (C,D) and the output color across *all* training examples.\n2.  Identify all (C,D) combinations that consistently map to a specific color.\n3.  Identify (C,D) combinations that have inconsistent mappings (ambiguous cases).\n4.  Identify (C,D) combinations discovered in later examples that were missing from the initial ruleset.\n5.  Formulate a revised, comprehensive set of rules based on these findings. If ambiguity remains for certain counts, establish a default rule while acknowledging its potential inaccuracy for specific instances.\n6.  Update the YAML facts and the Natural Language program accordingly.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis of Errors**\n\nWe will programmatically analyze the differences between the expected outputs and the outputs generated by the previous code (which defaulted ambiguous cases and missing rules to Red=2).\n\n"
