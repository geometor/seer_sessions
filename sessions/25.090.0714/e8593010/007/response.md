"""
Transforms a grid containing gray (5) and white (0) pixels based on the 
neighborhood of each white pixel. Gray pixels remain unchanged. 

The transformation rule for a white pixel is determined by counting its 
cardinal (adjacent) and diagonal white neighbors:
- Let C be the count of cardinal white neighbors.
- Let D be the count of diagonal white neighbors.

The output color for the white pixel's position is assigned based on the 
(C, D) tuple according to the following specific rules:
1. If (C, D) == (0, 0) -> Green (3)
2. If (C, D) == (0, 1) -> Green (3)
3. If (C, D) == (2, 0) -> Blue (1)
4. If (C, D) == (1, 2) -> Blue (1)
5. If (C, D) == (1, 3) -> Blue (1) (Observed in train_3)
6. If (C, D) == (2, 1) -> Blue (1) (Observed in train_3)
7. For all other combinations of (C, D) for a white pixel, the default 
   output color is Red (2). This includes the cases (1,0) and (1,1), 
   which were observed in the training examples to sometimes result in Blue (1)
   instead. The specific condition distinguishing Blue(1) from Red(2) for 
   these counts is not fully captured by this rule set and remains an unresolved 
   factor, hence the default assignment might be incorrect for some instances.
