task_description: >
  Transform white pixels in a grid based on the count of their white neighbors.
  Gray pixels remain unchanged. The color assigned to a white pixel depends on
  the specific counts of its cardinal (adjacent) and diagonal white neighbors.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Variable (observed 10x10)
  - possible_colors: 0 (white), 5 (gray) in input; 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green), 5 (gray) in output.

objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
      - neighborhood: 8 surrounding pixels (cardinal and diagonal)

transformations:
  - type: conditional_color_change
    input_object: white pixel (color 0)
    output_object: colored pixel (color 1, 2, or 3)
    condition: Based on counts of white neighbors (Cardinal C, Diagonal D).
    rules:
      - counts: (C=0, D=0) -> output_color: 3 (Green)
      - counts: (C=0, D=1) -> output_color: 3 (Green)
      - counts: (C=2, D=0) -> output_color: 1 (Blue)
      - counts: (C=1, D=2) -> output_color: 1 (Blue)
      - counts: (C=1, D=3) -> output_color: 1 (Blue)
      - counts: (C=2, D=1) -> output_color: 1 (Blue)
      - counts: (C=1, D=0) -> output_color: {1 (Blue) OR 2 (Red)} # Ambiguity found
      - counts: (C=1, D=1) -> output_color: {1 (Blue) OR 2 (Red)} # Ambiguity found
      - default_rule (hypothesis): All other white pixels -> output_color: 2 (Red)

uncertainty: >
  The exact condition distinguishing between Blue(1) and Red(2) output for
  neighbor counts (1,0) and (1,1) is not fully resolved by local neighbor counts alone.
  The simplest hypothesis is that the default is Red(2), but this failed testing.
  Revisiting implementation of the default logic is needed.
