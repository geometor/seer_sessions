            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided transformation function successfully identifies the general principle of the task: changing the color of white pixels based on the count of their cardinal and diagonal white neighbors, while leaving gray pixels unchanged. The function correctly handles several specific neighbor count configurations ((0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1)), mapping them consistently to Green(3) or Blue(1) across all examples.\n\nHowever, the function fails on configurations where the mapping observed in the examples was ambiguous: specifically, when the counts are (1 cardinal, 0 diagonal) or (1 cardinal, 1 diagonal). The current strategy defaults these cases to Red(2), but the examples show they sometimes result in Blue(1).\n\nThe strategy to resolve these errors is:\n1.  **Pinpoint Errors:** Identify the exact coordinates, input neighbor counts, predicted color, and expected color for every incorrectly transformed pixel in the training examples.\n2.  **Analyze Error Context:** Examine the local neighborhood configuration (input grid) around the incorrectly predicted pixels, focusing on the (1,0) and (1,1) count cases. Look for distinguishing features between pixels that *should* be Red(2) and those that *should* be Blue(1) despite having the same (1,0) or (1,1) counts.\n3.  **Refine Hypothesis:** Formulate a more precise rule for the (1,0) and (1,1) cases based on the identified distinguishing features.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the refined rule.\n\n## Metrics and Error Analysis\n\nThe following code analyzes the discrepancies between the expected outputs and the outputs generated by the previous `transform` function for each training example.\n\n"
