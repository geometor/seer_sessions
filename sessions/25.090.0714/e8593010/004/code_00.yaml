task_context:
  description: Transform a grid containing gray (5) and white (0) pixels. Gray pixels remain unchanged. White pixels change color based on their local neighborhood.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: variable (observed 10x10)
  - possible_colors: 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green), 5 (gray)

objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: initial color (0 or 5)
      - position: (row, column)
      - neighbors: 8 surrounding pixels (cardinal and diagonal)

transformation:
  - type: conditional_color_change
    target_object: white pixels (color 0)
    condition: based on the count of white neighbors
    variables:
      - C: count of cardinal white neighbors (0-4)
      - D: count of diagonal white neighbors (0-4)
    rules:
      - description: Gray pixels remain gray.
        input_color: 5
        output_color: 5
      - description: White pixel color determined by (C, D) counts.
        input_color: 0
        output_determination:
          - condition: (C=0, D=0) -> output_color: 3 (Green)
          - condition: (C=0, D=1) -> output_color: 3 (Green)
          - condition: (C=2, D=0) -> output_color: 1 (Blue)
          - condition: (C=1, D=2) -> output_color: 1 (Blue)
          - condition: (C=1, D=3) -> output_color: 1 (Blue)
          - condition: (C=2, D=1) -> output_color: 1 (Blue)
          # --- Ambiguous Cases ---
          - condition: (C=1, D=0) -> output_color: Needs refinement (can be 1 or 2)
          - condition: (C=1, D=1) -> output_color: Needs refinement (can be 1 or 2)
          # --- Default/Fallback (if refinement fails) ---
          # - condition: other (C, D) for white pixels -> output_color: 2 (Red) [Current flawed logic]
    unresolved_factor: The specific condition that differentiates between Blue(1) and Red(2) output for (C=1, D=0) and (C=1, D=1) cases is not yet identified. It likely involves a more specific local pattern or property beyond simple counts.
