"""
The transformation identifies all distinct contiguous objects (groups of connected pixels of the same non-white color) in the input grid. 
It calculates the average row index of all non-white pixels across the entire grid. The floor of this average determines the target starting row ('target_start_row') for the vertically aligned objects in the output grid.
An output grid of the same dimensions as the input is created, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
Each non-white pixel from the input grid is then mapped to the output grid. For a pixel at (r, c) belonging to an object whose topmost row is 'obj_min_r', its new row ('new_r') is calculated as 'target_start_row + (r - obj_min_r)'. The column ('new_c') remains the same as the original column 'c'. The pixel at (new_r, new_c) in the output grid is set to the color of the original pixel. This process effectively aligns all objects vertically based on the calculated average row, preserving their internal structure and relative horizontal positions.
