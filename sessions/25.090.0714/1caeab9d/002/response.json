            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial transformation logic, which calculated the target alignment row based on the floor of the average row index of all non-white pixels, failed for Example 1 while succeeding for Examples 2 and 3. This indicates the rule for determining the vertical alignment (`target_start_row`) needs refinement.\n\nAnalysis revealed a potential difference based on whether the non-white objects in the input grid are vertically separated or if their vertical extents overlap/touch.\n- Example 1 has vertically separated objects.\n- Examples 2 and 3 have objects whose vertical extents overlap or touch.\n\nA new hypothesis (Hypothesis 3) was formulated:\n1.  If objects are vertically separated, the `target_start_row` is the maximum of the minimum row indices of all objects.\n2.  If objects overlap or touch vertically, the `target_start_row` is the maximum row index of the object that has the overall minimum starting row index.\n\nThe strategy is to verify this hypothesis using code execution and then update the natural language program and the transformation logic accordingly.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's use code execution to find the objects, check for vertical separation, and calculate the target row based on Hypothesis 3 for each example.\n\n"
