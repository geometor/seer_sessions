Fill Enclosed Areas: Identify any white (0) pixels that are fully enclosed by the gray object (cannot reach the grid boundary by moving only horizontally or vertically through white pixels) and change their color to red (2).\n2.  Draw Indicator Line: Determine the topmost row of the gray object (R_min). Draw a horizontal red (2) line in the row immediately above it (R_min - 1). The horizontal extent (start and end columns) of this line depends on the specific gray object's position and bounding box, following a pattern observed in the examples.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Find all separate gray objects.\n- Use a flood fill starting from the border's white pixels to identify all white pixels connected to the outside.\n- Any white pixel not reached by the flood fill is considered enclosed.\n- Fill these enclosed white pixels with red.\n- For each gray object, find its minimum row (R_min) and bounding box (C_min, C_max).\n- Determine the line's start and end columns based on a lookup derived from the training examples' bounding boxes (this part is specific to the examples and may not generalize perfectly).\n- Draw the red line in row R_min - 1 across the determined columns, clamped to grid boundaries.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all connected components (objects) of a specified color in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        color (int): The color of the objects to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[set]: A list where each element is a set of (row, col) tuples\n                   representing the coordinates of a distinct object.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # If we find a pixel of the target color that hasn't been visited\n            if grid[r, c] == color and not visited[r, c]:\n                obj_coords = set()\n                q = deque([(r, c)]) # Queue for BFS\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                \n                # Perform BFS to find all connected pixels of the same color\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    obj_coords.add((row, col))\n                    # Check orthogonal neighbors\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        # Check bounds and if neighbor is the same color and not visited\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                            \n                # Add the found object's coordinates to the list if it's not empty\n                if obj_coords:\n                    objects.append(obj_coords)\n    return objects\n\ndef get_bounding_box(obj_coords):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bounding box (min/max row/col) for a set of coordinates.\n\n    Args:\n        obj_coords (set): A set of (row, col) tuples.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple or None: (r_min, c_min, r_max, c_max) or None if coords are empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not obj_coords:\n        return None\n    rows = [r for r, c in obj_coords]\n    cols = [c for r, c in obj_coords]\n    return min(rows), min(cols), max(rows), max(cols)\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule: fills enclosed white areas within gray objects\n    with red and adds a red indicator line above each gray object.\n\n    Args:\n        input"
