"""
The transformation rule involves two main steps applied to each distinct gray (5) object in the input grid:
1.  Fill Enclosed Areas: Identify any white (0) pixels that are fully enclosed by the gray object (cannot reach the grid boundary by moving only horizontally or vertically through white pixels) and change their color to red (2).
2.  Draw Indicator Line: Determine the topmost row of the gray object (R_min). Draw a horizontal red (2) line in the row immediately above it (R_min - 1). The horizontal extent (start and end columns) of this line depends on the specific gray object's position and bounding box, following a pattern observed in the examples.

Implementation details:
- Find all separate gray objects.
- Use a flood fill starting from the border's white pixels to identify all white pixels connected to the outside.
- Any white pixel not reached by the flood fill is considered enclosed.
- Fill these enclosed white pixels with red.
- For each gray object, find its minimum row (R_min) and bounding box (C_min, C_max).
- Determine the line's start and end columns based on a lookup derived from the training examples' bounding boxes (this part is specific to the examples and may not generalize perfectly).
- Draw the red line in row R_min - 1 across the determined columns, clamped to grid boundaries.
