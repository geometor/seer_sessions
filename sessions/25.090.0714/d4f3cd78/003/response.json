Identify the single connected object composed of gray (5) pixels.\n2. Identify all background (0) pixels that are enclosed by the gray object (i.e., cannot reach the grid boundary by moving only through background pixels).\n3. Fill this enclosed background area with azure (8) pixels.\n4. Find the vertical \"gap\" column within the horizontal span of the gray object. This is the column with the minimum number of gray pixels within the object's bounding box columns.\n5. Determine the vertical center of the gray object.\n6. Compare the object's center to the grid's center to decide the direction of an exterior line (upwards if the object is lower, downwards if the object is upper or centered).\n7.
