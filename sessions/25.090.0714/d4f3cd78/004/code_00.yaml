task_description: Fill the interior of a C-shaped gray container with azure, and add a vertical azure line extending outwards from the container's gap, with the line's direction based on the container's vertical position.

elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Canvas.
  - element: container
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - Forms a single connected component, typically C-shaped or bracket-shaped.
      - Acts as a boundary defining an interior region.
      - Has a vertical gap (a column with fewer gray pixels than adjacent columns within its span).
    role: Defines the area to be filled and provides reference points for the exterior line.
  - element: fill_color
    color: azure (8)
    role: Used to fill the interior region and create the exterior line.

relationships:
  - type: containment (visual)
    element1: container (gray)
    element2: background (white)
    description: The gray container visually encloses a region of the white background, accessible via the gap.
  - type: adjacency
    element1: fill_color (azure)
    element2: container (gray)
    description: The azure fill touches the inner boundary of the gray container. The azure line touches the outer boundary (top or bottom edge) of the gray container at the gap column.
  - type: spatial
    element1: container (gray)
    element2: grid
    description: The vertical center of mass of the container relative to the grid's vertical center determines the direction of the exterior azure line.

actions:
  - action: identify_container
    input: grid
    output: Coordinates of the single connected gray (5) object.
  - action: find_gap_column
    input: container coordinates, grid dimensions
    output: Column index of the vertical gap (minimum gray pixels within container's column span).
  - action: identify_seed_pixel
    input: container coordinates, gap_column, grid
    output: Coordinates of one background (0) pixel inside the visually contained area, suitable for starting a flood fill. (e.g., adjacent to a gray pixel in the gap column, between the top and bottom gray pixels of that column).
  - action: flood_fill_interior
    input: grid, seed_pixel
    output: Modify the grid by changing all reachable background (0) pixels from the seed (stopping at non-background) to azure (8).
  - action: determine_vertical_center
    input: container coordinates
    output: The average row index of the container pixels.
  - action: determine_extension_direction
    input: container_vertical_center, grid_height
    output: Direction (up or down) for the exterior line based on whether the container center is below or above/at the grid center.
  - action: find_line_start_row
    input: container coordinates, gap_column, direction
    output: The row index adjacent to the container's edge (topmost or bottommost gray pixel in the gap column) from which the line should start.
  - action: draw_exterior_line
    input: grid (potentially already filled), gap_column, start_row, direction, grid_height
    output: Modify the grid by adding a vertical azure (8) line in the gap column, starting from `start_row` and extending to the grid boundary in the specified `direction`, only overwriting background (0) pixels.
