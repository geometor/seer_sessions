task_description: Fill the visually enclosed area of a C-shaped gray container with azure, and draw a vertical azure line extending from the container's gap to the grid edge, directed away from the container's vertical center.

elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Canvas.
  - element: container
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - Forms a single connected object.
      - Resembles a 'C' or bracket shape, creating a visually enclosed region.
      - Has a vertical gap (column within its span with the minimum number of gray pixels).
    role: Defines the area for interior filling and reference points/direction for the exterior line.
  - element: fill_color
    color: azure (8)
    role: Color used for both the interior fill and the exterior line.

relationships:
  - type: visual_containment
    element1: container (gray)
    element2: background (white)
    description: The container bounds a region of the background that needs filling, accessible via the gap.
  - type: adjacency
    element1: fill_color (azure)
    element2: container (gray)
    description: The azure fill is adjacent to the inner edge of the container. The exterior azure line is adjacent to the top or bottom edge of the container in the gap column.
  - type: relative_position
    element1: container (gray)
    element2: grid
    description: The vertical center of the container relative to the grid's vertical center determines if the exterior line extends upwards or downwards.

actions:
  - action: copy_input
    input: grid
    output: working_grid (a mutable copy).
  - action: identify_object
    input: working_grid, color=gray(5)
    output: coordinates of the container pixels.
  - action: find_gap_column
    input: container_coordinates, grid_dimensions
    output: column_index corresponding to the vertical gap.
  - action: find_interior_seed
    input: working_grid, container_coordinates, gap_column
    output: coordinates (row, col) of a background(0) pixel suitable for starting flood fill (e.g., horizontally adjacent to a gray pixel in the gap column, between the vertical bounds of the gap).
  - action: flood_fill
    input: working_grid, seed_coordinates, target_color=background(0), fill_color=azure(8)
    output: Modify working_grid by filling the connected area of target_color starting from seed with fill_color.
  - action: calculate_vertical_center
    input: container_coordinates
    output: average_row_index.
  - action: determine_line_direction_and_start
    input: average_row_index, grid_height, container_coordinates, gap_column
    output: line_start_row, line_direction (up/down).
  - action: draw_vertical_line
    input: working_grid, gap_column, line_start_row, line_direction, grid_height, fill_color=azure(8), overwrite_color=background(0)
    output: Modify working_grid by drawing the line, only changing pixels matching overwrite_color.
