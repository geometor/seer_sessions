The transformation involves two main parts:\n\n1.  **Filling the Interior:** The area enclosed by the gray shape, which is initially white, is filled with azure (8) pixels. This suggests a flood-fill or region-filling operation starting from a point inside the shape's boundary.\n2.  **Adding an Exterior Line:** A vertical line of azure (8) pixels is added outside the gray shape. This line appears to be aligned with a vertical gap or axis of symmetry in the gray shape. The direction of this line (upwards or downwards) seems dependent on the vertical position of the gray shape within the grid. If the shape is predominantly in the lower half, the line extends upwards from the top edge. If the shape is predominantly in the upper half, the line extends downwards from the bottom edge. The line extends all the way to the grid boundary.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
