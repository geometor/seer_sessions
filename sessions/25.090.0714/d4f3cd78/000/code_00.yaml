task_description: Fill the interior of a gray shape with azure and add a vertical azure line extending outwards from the shape's gap, directed away from the shape's vertical center.

elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Canvas for the main object.
  - element: shape
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - Forms a single connected component.
      - Acts as a boundary, enclosing a region of the background.
      - Has a vertical gap or opening, typically on one side (right side in examples).
    role: Defines the area to be filled and the reference for the exterior line.
  - element: fill_color
    color: azure (8)
    role: Used to fill the interior region and create the exterior line.

relationships:
  - type: containment
    element1: shape (gray)
    element2: background (white)
    description: The gray shape encloses a region of the white background.
  - type: adjacency
    element1: fill_color (azure)
    element2: shape (gray)
    description: The azure fill touches the inner boundary of the gray shape. The azure line touches the outer boundary (top or bottom edge) of the gray shape.
  - type: spatial
    element1: shape (gray)
    element2: grid
    description: The vertical position of the shape within the grid determines the direction of the exterior azure line.

actions:
  - action: identify_shape
    input: grid
    output: The single connected gray (5) object.
  - action: identify_interior
    input: grid, shape
    output: The white (0) region enclosed by the shape.
  - action: fill_interior
    input: interior_region
    output: Change the color of the interior region to azure (8).
  - action: identify_gap_column
    input: shape
    output: The column index corresponding to the vertical gap/symmetry axis of the shape.
  - action: determine_vertical_position
    input: shape, grid
    output: Whether the shape is primarily in the upper or lower half of the grid.
  - action: determine_extension_edge_and_direction
    input: shape, vertical_position
    output: The starting row (top or bottom edge of the shape) and direction (up or down) for the exterior line.
  - action: draw_exterior_line
    input: grid, gap_column, start_row, direction
    output: Add a vertical azure (8) line in the gap column, starting from the determined edge and extending to the grid boundary in the specified direction.
