Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the single connected object composed of gray (5) pixels.
2. Fill the area enclosed by this gray object with azure (8) pixels.
3. Find the vertical "gap" column within the horizontal span of the gray object. This is the column with the minimum number of gray pixels.
4. Determine the vertical center of the gray object.
5. Compare the object's center to the grid's center to decide the direction of an exterior line (upwards if the object is lower, downwards if the object is upper or centered).
6. Draw a vertical line of azure (8) pixels in the identified "gap" column, starting from the edge of the gray object (top edge for upwards line, bottom edge for downwards line) and extending to the grid boundary.
