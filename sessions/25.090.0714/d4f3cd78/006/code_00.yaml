task_description: Fill the interior of a gray C-shaped container with azure, and draw a vertical azure line extending from the container's opening/gap away from the container's vertical center towards the grid edge.

elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Canvas, space to be filled (interior), space for exterior line.
  - element: container
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - Forms a single connected component, roughly C-shaped or rectangular with one side having a gap.
      - Defines an interior region.
      - Has a specific column ('gap_column') within its horizontal span containing the minimum number of gray pixels.
      - Has a vertical center of mass.
    role: Boundary for fill, reference for exterior line position and direction.
  - element: fill_color
    color: azure (8)
    role: Fills the interior, forms the exterior line.

relationships:
  - type: containment
    element1: container (gray)
    element2: background (white)
    description: The container encloses a region of the background.
  - type: adjacency
    element1: fill_color (azure, interior)
    element2: container (gray)
    description: The interior azure fill touches the inner boundary of the gray container.
  - type: adjacency
    element1: fill_color (azure, exterior line)
    element2: container (gray)
    description: The exterior azure line starts adjacent to the top or bottom edge of the container in the gap_column.
  - type: spatial
    element1: container (gray)
    element2: grid
    description: The vertical position of the container's center relative to the grid's center determines the direction (up/down) of the exterior line.

actions:
  - action: identify_container
    input: grid
    output: Coordinates of all gray (5) pixels.
  - action: find_gap_column
    input: grid, container_coordinates
    output: The column index within the container's horizontal span having the minimum number of gray pixels.
  - action: find_interior_seed
    input: grid, container_coordinates, gap_column
    output: Coordinates of a background (0) pixel inside the container, preferably in the gap_column within the container's vertical span.
  - action: flood_fill_interior
    input: grid, seed_pixel
    output: Modify the grid, changing connected background (0) pixels starting from the seed to azure (8), bounded by non-background pixels.
  - action: calculate_vertical_center
    input: container_coordinates
    output: The average row index of the container pixels.
  - action: determine_line_properties
    input: container_coordinates, gap_column, container_vertical_center, grid_height
    output: start_row (row adjacent to container edge), direction (up=-1 or down=1), target_column (gap_column).
  - action: draw_exterior_line
    input: grid, start_row, direction, target_column
    output: Modify the grid, changing background (0) pixels to azure (8) along the specified vertical line segment from start_row to the grid edge.
