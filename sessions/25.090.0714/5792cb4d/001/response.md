"""
Identifies a single connected object of non-background pixels (azure, 8). 
Finds the two endpoints of this object (pixels with only one object neighbor).
Traces the path connecting these endpoints.
Extracts the colors along this path, reverses the color sequence, and applies 
the reversed sequence back onto the path pixels in the output grid. 
The background remains unchanged.
