*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output grids are the same size (10x10).
    *   Both grids have a dominant background color: azure (8).
    *   In both examples, there is a single connected object composed of non-azure pixels.
    *   The shape and position of this object remain the same from input to output.
    *   The colors of the pixels *within* the object change.
    *   The object in `train_1` is an 'L' shape with a horizontal segment and two vertical pixels attached at the ends. The object in `train_2` is a more complex, snake-like path.
    *   Comparing the input and output colors for the object suggests a transformation based on the object's structure. Specifically, the object appears to behave like a path or sequence.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_size: constant (10x10 in examples)
      background_color: azure (8)
      num_objects: 1 (connected component of non-background pixels)

    object_properties:
      type: connected component of non-background pixels
      structure: path-like (a sequence of connected pixels)
      invariance: position and shape remain constant between input and output
      endpoints: two pixels within the object having only one object neighbor (degree 1 nodes in the object graph)

    transformation:
      action: modify colors within the object
      rule: reverse the sequence of colors along the path connecting the two endpoints
      details:
        - identify the object pixels
        - find the two endpoint pixels
        - trace the path between endpoints
        - extract the color sequence along the path
        - reverse the color sequence
        - map the reversed colors back onto the path pixels in the output grid

    relationships:
      - pixels within the object are connected adjacently (including diagonals)
      - endpoints define the start and end of the color sequence to be reversed
      - background pixels are unchanged
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the single connected object formed by pixels that are not the background color (azure, 8).
    2.  Find the two endpoint pixels of this object. An endpoint is an object pixel connected to only one other object pixel (considering 8-way adjacency).
    3.  Determine the unique path (sequence of adjacent pixels) that connects these two endpoints within the object.
    4.  Extract the list of colors corresponding to the pixels along this path, starting from one endpoint and proceeding to the other.
    5.  Reverse the order of the colors in this list.
    6.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
    7.  Replace the color of each pixel along the path in the output grid with the color at the corresponding position in the reversed list. Keep all background pixels unchanged.
