"""
Identifies the single connected object of non-background pixels (azure, 8).
Finds the two endpoint pixels of this object (pixels with only one object neighbor 
using 8-way connectivity).
Determines the unique path connecting these two endpoints within the object 
using Breadth-First Search (BFS).
Extracts the sequence of colors along this path.
Reverses the sequence of colors.
Applies the reversed color sequence back onto the path pixels in the output grid.
The background color (azure, 8) remains unchanged.
