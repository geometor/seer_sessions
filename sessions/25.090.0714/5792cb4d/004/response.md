## Assessment and Strategy

The initial code successfully transformed `train_1` but failed on `train_2`. The failure manifested as two pixels having swapped colors compared to the expected output: `(6, 5)` was `9` instead of `6`, and `(7, 5)` was `6` instead of `9`.

*   **Core Logic:** The overall strategy of identifying a non-background object, finding its endpoints, determining the path between them, and reversing the colors along that path seems correct based on the success in `train_1` and the nature of the transformation in `train_2`.
*   **Point of Failure:** The discrepancy in `train_2` strongly suggests an issue with the `find_full_path_dfs` function. While it aimed to find a path covering all object pixels between the endpoints, the specific path it found might differ from the implicit "correct" path, especially if the path structure allows for minor variations or if the DFS implementation detail (like neighbor exploration order) affects the outcome. The manual trace showed that the expected output corresponds to a specific, seemingly unique, sequential path along the object's shape.
*   **Revised Strategy:**
    1.  Confirm the endpoint identification method (`find_min_neighbor_ends`) is correctly identifying the start and end of the sequence for both examples. Pixels with only one object neighbor (degree 1) seem to be the correct definition.
    2.  Replace the complex Hamiltonian path finding (DFS) with a simpler "path walking" algorithm. This algorithm starts at one endpoint and iteratively moves to the next unvisited adjacent object pixel until it reaches the other endpoint. This assumes the object is always a simple, non-branching path.
    3.  Apply this refined path-finding and color reversal logic.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's verify the object properties and endpoints for both examples using the helper functions.
