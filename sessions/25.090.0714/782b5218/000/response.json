            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels. The size appears consistent between input and output for each example (10x10).\n2.  **Key Colors:**\n    *   **Red (2):** Appears to act as a critical marker or boundary within the grid. Its position seems fundamental to the transformation.\n    *   **White (0):** Acts as a background or reset color in the output, particularly in areas above the red markers and in columns lacking red markers.\n    *   **Other Colors (Gray-5, Blue-1, Azure-8):** These colors participate in the transformation, either being copied or used as a fill color below the red markers, depending on the example.\n3.  **Columnar Processing:** The transformation seems to operate independently on each column, guided by the position of the red pixels within that column.\n4.  **Vertical Boundary:** The *highest* red pixel (minimum row index) in each column serves as a vertical boundary.\n5.  **Transformation Rules:**\n    *   **Above Boundary:** Pixels located *above* the highest red pixel in a column are consistently replaced with white (0).\n    *   **At Boundary:** The highest red pixel itself is preserved in the output.\n    *   **Below Boundary:** The treatment of pixels *below* the highest red pixel varies:\n        *   In `train_1`, the original pixel colors from the input seem to be copied into the output for positions at or below the highest red pixel.\n        *   In `train_2` and `train_3`, the pixels below the highest red pixel are *filled* with a single, uniform color (blue-1 in `train_2`, azure-8 in `train_3`).\n    *   **No Boundary:** If a column contains no red pixels, the entire column in the output becomes white (0).\n6.  **Determining Fill vs. Copy:** There must be a condition that differentiates `train_1` (copy below) from `train_2` and `train_3` (fill below). Let's examine the overall color composition:\n    *   `train_1`: Contains gray (5), red (2), white (0). The most frequent non-white/non-red color is gray (5). Output uses \"copy\".\n    *   `train_2`: Contains blue (1), red (2), white (0). The most frequent non-white/non-red color is blue (1). Output uses \"fill\" with blue (1).\n    *   `train_3`: Contains azure (8), red (2), white (0). The most frequent non-white/non-red color is azure (8). Output uses \"fill\" with azure (8).\n    *   This suggests a rule: Find the most frequent color in the input grid, ignoring white (0) and red (2). If this color is gray (5), use the \"copy\" method below the red markers. Otherwise, use the \"fill\" method with this most frequent color.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
