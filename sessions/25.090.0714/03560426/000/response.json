            "text": "*   **Perception:** The input grids contain multiple distinct, non-overlapping, solid-colored rectangular or L-shaped objects on a white background. These objects are generally located in the bottom half of the input grid and arranged somewhat horizontally. The output grids also contain the exact same objects (same shapes, colors, and sizes) but rearranged. In the output, the objects are positioned starting from the top-left corner, forming a diagonal cascade downwards and to the right. The order in which the objects appear in this cascade corresponds to their left-to-right order in the input grid. The placement rule seems specific: each subsequent object's top-left corner is positioned relative to the previously placed object. Specifically, the next object starts in the row corresponding to the bottom row of the previously placed object, and in the column immediately to the right of the previously placed object's leftmost column.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Sort these identified objects based on their leftmost column index in the input grid, from the smallest index (leftmost) to the largest index (rightmost).\n    5.

Place this object onto the output grid such that its top-leftmost pixel (relative to its own shape) is positioned at the current anchor coordinates `(next_row, next_col)`. Use the object's color for its pixels.\n        c.  After placing the object, find the row index of its bottom-most pixel (`placed_bottom_row`) and the column index of its left-most pixel (`placed_left_col`) in the output grid.\n        d.  Update the anchor position for the *next* object by setting `next_row = placed_bottom_row` and `next_col = placed_left_col + 1`.\n    7.
