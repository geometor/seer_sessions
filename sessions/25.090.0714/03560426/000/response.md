*   **Perception:** The input grids contain multiple distinct, non-overlapping, solid-colored rectangular or L-shaped objects on a white background. These objects are generally located in the bottom half of the input grid and arranged somewhat horizontally. The output grids also contain the exact same objects (same shapes, colors, and sizes) but rearranged. In the output, the objects are positioned starting from the top-left corner, forming a diagonal cascade downwards and to the right. The order in which the objects appear in this cascade corresponds to their left-to-right order in the input grid. The placement rule seems specific: each subsequent object's top-left corner is positioned relative to the previously placed object. Specifically, the next object starts in the row corresponding to the bottom row of the previously placed object, and in the column immediately to the right of the previously placed object's leftmost column.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Rearrange colored objects from the input grid into a diagonal cascade in the output grid based on their left-to-right order.

    elements:
      - role: background
        color: white (0)
        properties: Fills the grid initially.
      - role: object
        properties:
          - Contiguous block of non-white pixels.
          - Can be rectangular or L-shaped.
          - Retains its shape, size, and color from input to output.
          - Does not overlap with other objects in the input or output.

    relationships:
      - type: spatial_order
        scope: input
        description: Objects are ordered based on their horizontal position, specifically their leftmost column index (ascending).
      - type: spatial_arrangement
        scope: output
        description: Objects are arranged in a diagonal cascade starting from the top-left corner (0,0).
        rule: The placement of each object depends on the position of the previously placed object.

    transformation:
      - action: identify_objects
        source: input
        target: objects
        details: Find all contiguous non-white blocks. Record their shape, color, and original bounding box.
      - action: sort_objects
        source: objects
        criteria: Leftmost column index in the input grid (ascending).
      - action: initialize_grid
        target: output
        details: Create a grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white).
      - action: place_objects_cascade
        source: sorted_objects
        target: output
        details:
          - Initialize the placement anchor `(next_row, next_col)` to `(0, 0)`.
          - For each object in sorted order:
            - Place the object's top-left corner at `(next_row, next_col)`.
            - Determine the placed object's bottom row (`placed_bottom_row`) and leftmost column (`placed_left_col`).
            - Update the anchor for the next object: `next_row = placed_bottom_row`, `next_col = placed_left_col + 1`.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a new grid (the output) with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects (groups of connected pixels of the same non-white color) in the input grid.
    3.  For each identified object, determine its color, its shape (the relative positions of its pixels), and the coordinates of its bounding box in the input grid (specifically noting its leftmost column index, top row index, and bottom row index).
    4.  Sort these identified objects based on their leftmost column index in the input grid, from the smallest index (leftmost) to the largest index (rightmost).
    5.  Initialize a placement anchor position `(next_row, next_col)` to `(0, 0)`.
    6.  Iterate through the objects in the sorted order:
        a.  Take the current object.
        b.  Place this object onto the output grid such that its top-leftmost pixel (relative to its own shape) is positioned at the current anchor coordinates `(next_row, next_col)`. Use the object's color for its pixels.
        c.  After placing the object, find the row index of its bottom-most pixel (`placed_bottom_row`) and the column index of its left-most pixel (`placed_left_col`) in the output grid.
        d.  Update the anchor position for the *next* object by setting `next_row = placed_bottom_row` and `next_col = placed_left_col + 1`.
    7.  After placing all objects according to this rule, the resulting grid is the final output.
