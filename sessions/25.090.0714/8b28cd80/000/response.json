All other pixels are white (color 0).\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output is always a 9x9 grid. It contains a pattern made of the same non-white color found in the input grid, set against a white background.\n3.  **Transformation:** The position of the single non-white pixel in the 3x3 input grid determines *which* specific 9x9 pattern is generated in the output. The color of that input pixel determines the color used to draw the output pattern. There seems to be a unique, fixed 9x9 pattern associated with each of the 9 possible positions in the 3x3 input grid.\n\n**Facts YAML:**\n\n"
