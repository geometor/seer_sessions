"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid containing a single colored pixel into a 9x9 output grid.
The transformation selects a predefined 9x9 binary pattern based on the row and column 
index of the non-white pixel in the 3x3 input grid. It then creates the 9x9 output 
grid by coloring the cells indicated by '1' in the selected binary pattern with the 
color of the input pixel, leaving the rest as white (0). 

There are 9 possible input positions, and thus 9 unique predefined 9x9 patterns. 
This implementation includes the patterns derived from the 5 provided training examples.
If an input pixel position is encountered for which the pattern is not defined here, 
it will return a default 9x9 white grid.
