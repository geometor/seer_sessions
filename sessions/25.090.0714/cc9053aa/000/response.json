            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors involved are white (0 - background), azure (8), maroon (9), and orange (7). The transformation specifically changes some azure (8) pixels to maroon (9). Orange (7) pixels seem unaffected and might be internal features of the main azure shape or irrelevant markers.\n2.  **Core Object:** The central element in each input grid appears to be a shape or pattern composed mainly of azure (8) pixels. This shape varies across examples.\n3.  **Transformation Trigger:** The presence and location of maroon (9) pixels relative to the azure (8) shape seem to dictate the transformation.\n4.  **Transformation Effect:** The transformation involves changing specific columns of azure (8) pixels to maroon (9). The columns affected depend on the location of the trigger maroon (9) pixels.\n5.  **Location Categories:** Maroon (9) pixels can be categorized based on their column index relative to the columns occupied by the azure (8) shape:\n    *   **Left:** Maroon pixels in columns to the left of the azure shape's leftmost column.\n    *   **Right:** Maroon pixels in columns to the right of the azure shape's rightmost column.\n    *   **Middle:** Maroon pixels in columns that overlap with the azure shape's column span.\n6.  **Rule Mapping:**\n    *   If maroon pixels exist *only* in the Middle zone, the transformation affects azure pixels starting from the leftmost column containing a Middle maroon pixel, extending to the rightmost column of the azure shape. (Example 3)\n    *   If maroon pixels exist in the Left zone, the *rightmost* column of azure pixels is transformed. (Example 2)\n    *   If maroon pixels exist in the Right zone, the *leftmost* column of azure pixels is transformed. (Examples 1 and 2)\n    *   If both Left and Right maroon pixels exist, both the leftmost and rightmost azure columns are transformed. (Example 2)\n    *   The Left/Right rules seem to take precedence over the Middle rule. (Example 1 shows a Right and Middle maroon, but only the Leftmost azure column changes, consistent with the Right rule).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
