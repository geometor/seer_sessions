Input_Grid:
  description: A 2D grid of pixels with values 0-9 representing colors.
  contains:
    - background: color 0 (white)
    - primary_shape:
        color: 8 (azure)
        description: A contiguous or patterned block of azure pixels. Its exact shape varies.
        properties:
          - bounding_box: Defined by min/max row and column containing azure pixels.
    - trigger_pixels:
        color: 9 (maroon)
        description: One or more maroon pixels located potentially inside, outside, or adjacent to the primary shape. Their column position relative to the primary shape's columns is critical.
    - other_pixels:
        color: 7 (orange)
        description: Appear within or near the azure shape, but seem unaffected by the transformation.

Transformation:
  action: Modifies the Input_Grid to produce the Output_Grid.
  changes: Converts specific azure (8) pixels to maroon (9) pixels.
  rule_based_on: The column positions of maroon (9) pixels relative to the column span of azure (8) pixels.

Relationships:
  - Maroon_Location_vs_Azure_Columns:
      azure_min_col: The minimum column index containing an azure (8) pixel.
      azure_max_col: The maximum column index containing an azure (8) pixel.
      maroon_locations:
        - left: Maroon pixels in columns < azure_min_col.
        - right: Maroon pixels in columns > azure_max_col.
        - middle: Maroon pixels in columns >= azure_min_col AND <= azure_max_col.
          properties:
            - min_middle_col: The minimum column index among 'middle' maroon pixels.
  - Transformation_Rules (Prioritized):
      1. If 'right' maroons exist:
         action: Change all azure (8) pixels in column `azure_min_col` to maroon (9).
      2. If 'left' maroons exist:
         action: Change all azure (8) pixels in column `azure_max_col` to maroon (9).
         note: Rules 1 and 2 can apply concurrently if both left and right maroons exist.
      3. If NEITHER 'left' NOR 'right' maroons exist, BUT 'middle' maroons exist:
         action: For each column `c` from `min_middle_col` up to `azure_max_col`, change all azure (8) pixels in column `c` to maroon (9).
      4. If no maroons exist according to these categories, or no azure pixels exist:
         action: No changes are made.

Output_Grid:
  description: The result of applying the transformation rules to the Input_Grid.
  content: Primarily identical to the Input_Grid, except for the azure pixels changed to maroon according to the rules.
