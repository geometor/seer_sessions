Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of pixels with varying dimensions.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), and magenta (6). White pixels seem to act as the background and remain unchanged.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation specifically targets red (2) pixels. Some red pixels change to magenta (6) in the output, while others remain red.
4.  **Pattern Recognition:** By comparing input and output grids, the change from red (2) to magenta (6) consistently occurs where four red pixels form a 2x2 square in the input grid. All red pixels that are part of *any* such 2x2 square configuration change color.
5.  **Object Interaction:** The transformation doesn't depend on distinct "objects" in the traditional sense but rather on the local configuration of pixels. A single red pixel can be part of multiple overlapping 2x2 squares, and if it belongs to at least one, it changes color. Red pixels not part of any 2x2 red square remain unchanged.

**YAML Documentation:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors.
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Can be white (0), red (2), or magenta (6).
  - element: pattern
    type: local_configuration
    description: A 2x2 square composed entirely of red (2) pixels.
    location: Anywhere within the input grid.
  - element: transformation
    action: color_change
    input_color: red (2)
    output_color: magenta (6)
    condition: The red pixel must be part of at least one 2x2 square composed entirely of red pixels in the input grid.
    unchanged:
      - White (0) pixels remain white (0).
      - Red (2) pixels that are NOT part of any 2x2 red square remain red (2).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each possible top-left corner `(row, col)` of a 2x2 square within the input grid (i.e., from `row = 0` to `height - 2` and `col = 0` to `width - 2`).
3.  For each `(row, col)`, check if the pixels at `(row, col)`, `(row + 1, col)`, `(row, col + 1)`, and `(row + 1, col + 1)` in the *input* grid are all red (2).
4.  If all four pixels form a 2x2 red square, change the color of these corresponding four pixel locations in the *output* grid to magenta (6).
5.  After checking all possible 2x2 squares, the resulting output grid is the final answer. (Note: A pixel might be identified multiple times if it's part of overlapping 2x2 squares, but changing it to magenta repeatedly has no further effect).
```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
  """
  Transforms the input grid based on the following rule:
  1. Identify all occurrences of 2x2 squares composed entirely of red (2) pixels in the input grid.
  2. For every red (2) pixel that is part of at least one such 2x2 red square, change its color to magenta (6) in the output grid.
  3. All other pixels (white (0) or red (2) pixels not part of a 2x2 red square) remain unchanged.
