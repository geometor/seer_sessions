            "text": "**Revised Analysis based on Metrics:**\n\nThe code execution results reveal a significant discrepancy:\n\n1.  **My initial code execution identified fewer 2x2 squares than expected.**\n    *   Example 1: Code found 2 squares (`(1,5)`, `(7,2)`), but visual inspection and the Expected Output imply squares also exist at `(1,0)` and `(2,6)`. Let me check the input again for `(1,0)`: `input[1][0]=2`, `input[2][0]=0`. Ah! It's NOT a 2x2 red square. My initial visual scan was wrong. Let me re-check `(2,6)`: `input[2][6]=2`, `input[3][6]=2`, `input[2][7]=2`, `input[3][7]=2`. Yes, this is a 2x2 red square. My code missed this one. Why? Let's re-examine the code. The loop `for r in range(height - 1): for c in range(width - 1):` is correct. The check `all(p == 2 for p in pixels)` is correct. This is puzzling.\n    *   Example 3: Code found 1 square `(0,0)`. Expected Output implies another one involving `(4,3)`, `(5,1)`, `(5,2)`, `(5,3)`. Let's check input: `input[4][3]=2`, `input[5][3]=2`, `input[4][2]=0`, `input[5][2]=2`. Not a square at `(4,2)`. How about `(5,1)`? `input[5][1]=2`, `input[5][2]=2`, `input[4][1]=0`. No. Let's check the only other potential `(5,2)`: `input[5][2]=2`, `input[5][3]=2`, `input[4][2]=0`, `input[4][3]=2`. Not a square. Okay, so the Expected Output for Ex3 changing `(4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)` to magenta must be based on some other rule or there's an error in the Expected Output.\n    *   Example 4: Code found 0 squares. Expected Output has magenta pixels at `(2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6)`. Let's check input for `(2,6)`: `input[2][6]=2`, `input[3][6]=2`, `input[2][7]=2`, `input[3][7]=0`. Not a square. How about `(2,5)`? `input[2][5]=0`, `input[3][5]=2`. No. It seems the rule is *not* simply finding 2x2 red squares.\n\n2.  **The number of unique red pixels involved in the *identified* 2x2 squares does not match the number of magenta pixels in the Expected Output.** This confirms the rule is more complex or different.\n\n**Rethinking the Rule:**\n\nLet's re-examine the *changes*.\n*   Example 1: Squares at `(1,5)` and `(7,2)` and `(2,6)` change. Square starting at `(1,0)` also changes in the expected output. Pixels are `(1,0)=2`, `(1,1)=2`, `(2,0)=0`, `(2,1)=2`. What is special about these?\n*   Example 3: Square at `(0,0)` changes. Pixels `(4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)` also change. Input: `(4,3)=2`, `(5,1)=2`, `(5,2)=2`, `(5,3)=2`. These are just individual red pixels, except for the group `(5,1), (5,2), (5,3)`.\n*   Example 4: Pixels `(2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6)` change. Input: `(2,6)=2`, `(2,7)=2`, `(3,5)=2`, `(3,6)=2`. These form two adjacent horizontal pairs.\n\n**New Hypothesis:** Maybe it's about finding a specific \"L\" or \"corner\" shape of three red pixels, and if that shape can be completed into a 2x2 red square *by adding one more red pixel*, then *all four* positions (even if the fourth wasn't red initially) become magenta? No, that doesn't fit Example 1 where `(2,0)` is white but `(1,0), (1,1), (2,1)` become magenta.\n\n**Hypothesis 2: Identify all 2x2 squares where AT LEAST THREE pixels are red.** If such a square is found, change *all four* pixels in that 2x2 area in the output grid to magenta (6).\n\nLet's test Hypothesis 2:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   `@ (1,0)`: `(1,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=2`. -> 3 red. -> Change `(1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)` to 6. (Wait, output shows `(2,0)` stays 0). Okay, Hypothesis 2 is wrong.\n*   **Hypothesis 3: Identify all 2x2 squares where AT LEAST THREE pixels are red.** If such a square is found, change only the pixels within that 2x2 area *that were originally red* to magenta (6).\n*   **Example 1 Test (Hypothesis 3):**\n    *   `@ (1,0)`: `(1,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=2`. -> 3 red. Change `(1,0), (1,1), (2,1)` to 6. Output shows `(1,0)=6, (1,1)=6, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=6`. This matches!\n    *   `@ (1,5)`: `(1,5)=2, (1,6)=2, (2,5)=2, (2,6)=2`. -> 4 red. Change `(1,5), (1,6), (2,5), (2,6)` to 6. Matches output.\n    *   `@ (2,6)`: `(2,6)=2, (2,7)=2, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=2`. -> 4 red. Change `(2,6), (2,7), (3,6), (3,7)` to 6. Matches output.\n    *   `@ (7,2)`: `(7,2)=2, (7,3)=2, (8,2)=2, (8,3)=0`. -> 3 red. Change `(7,2), (7,3), (8,2)` to 6. Output shows `(7,2)=6, (7,3)=6, (8,2)=6, (8,3)=0`. Matches! (Wait, checking expected output again: `(8,2)` is 6, `(8,3)` is 6. My analysis of the output was wrong. Let me re-check the square `(7,2)`). Input: `(7,2)=2, (7,3)=2, (8,2)=2, (8,3)=0`. Okay. Expected Output: `(7,2)=6, (7,3)=6, (8,2)=6, (8,3)=6`. This contradicts Hypothesis 3.\n*   **Hypothesis 4: Identify any red pixel (2). Check the 3 potential 2x2 squares for which this pixel could be the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right corner. If *any* of those 2x2 squares contain 3 or more red pixels in the input, change the original red pixel to magenta (6) in the output.**\n*   **Example 1 Test (Hypothesis 4):**\n    *   Pixel `(1,0)` (red=2):\n        *   Can be TL of `(1,0)` square: `(1,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=2`. (3 reds). Change `(1,0)` to 6.\n    *   Pixel `(1,1)` (red=2):\n        *   Can be TR of `(1,0)` square: `(1,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=2`. (3 reds). Change `(1,1)` to 6.\n        *   Can be TL of `(1,1)` square: `(1,1)=2, (1,2)=0, (2,1)=2, (2,2)=0`. (2 reds). No change based on this square.\n    *   Pixel `(2,1)` (red=2):\n        *   Can be BL of `(1,1)` square: `(1,1)=2, (1,2)=0, (2,1)=2, (2,2)=0`. (2 reds). No change.\n        *   Can be BR of `(1,0)` square: `(1,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=2`. (3 reds). Change `(2,1)` to 6.\n    *   Pixel `(1,5)` (red=2):\n        *   Can be TL of `(1,5)` square: `(1,5)=2, (1,6)=2, (2,5)=2, (2,6)=2`. (4 reds). Change `(1,5)` to 6.\n    *   Pixel `(1,6)` (red=2):\n        *   Can be TR of `(1,5)` square: (4 reds). Change `(1,6)` to 6.\n        *   Can be TL of `(1,6)` square: `(1,6)=2, (1,7)=0, (2,6)=2, (2,7)=2`. (3 reds). Change `(1,6)` to 6 (already changed).\n    *   Pixel `(2,5)` (red=2):\n        *   Can be BL of `(1,5)` square: (4 reds). Change `(2,5)` to 6.\n    *   Pixel `(2,6)` (red=2):\n        *   Can be BR of `(1,5)` square: (4 reds). Change `(2,6)` to 6.\n        *   Can be TR of `(2,5)` square: `(2,5)=2, (2,6)=2, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=2`. (3 reds). Change `(2,6)` to 6.\n        *   Can be BL of `(1,6)` square: `(1,6)=2, (1,7)=0, (2,6)=2, (2,7)=2`. (3 reds). Change `(2,6)` to 6.\n        *   Can be TL of `(2,6)` square: `(2,6)=2, (2,7)=2, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=2`. (4 reds). Change `(2,6)` to 6.\n    *   ... This seems tedious but likely correct. Let's check a tricky pixel from the output: `(8,3)` becomes 6 in Example 1, but is 0 in the input. Hypothesis 4 *cannot* explain this.\n\n**Hypothesis 5 (Back to Basics):** The first attempt (find 2x2 red squares, change all 4 pixels to magenta) seemed plausible but the reported \"Transformed Output\" was wrong. What if the *code* was right, and the *expected outputs* provided are the ground truth? Let's re-examine the connection between the inputs and the EXPECTED outputs directly, ignoring the previous failed code run.\n\n*   **Rule:** Find all 2x2 squares in the input grid. If a 2x2 square contains **exactly 3** red pixels, change the location of the **non-red** pixel in that square to become red (2) in an intermediate grid. After checking all 2x2 squares, take this intermediate grid. Now, find all 2x2 squares in the *intermediate* grid that are entirely red (2). Change the pixels corresponding to these all-red 2x2 squares in the *final output grid* to magenta (6). All other pixels retain their color from the intermediate grid.\n\n*   **Example 1 Test (Hypothesis 5):**\n    *   Input Grid.\n    *   Square @ `(1,0)`: `(1,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=2`. 3 reds. Change `(2,0)` to 2.\n    *   Square @ `(1,5)`: `(1,5)=2, (1,6)=2, (2,5)=2, (2,6)=2`. 4 reds. No change.\n    *   Square @ `(1,6)`: `(1,6)=2, (1,7)=0, (2,6)=2, (2,7)=2`. 3 reds. Change `(1,7)` to 2.\n    *   Square @ `(2,5)`: `(2,5)=2, (2,6)=2, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=2`. 3 reds. Change `(3,5)` to 2.\n    *   Square @ `(2,6)`: `(2,6)=2, (2,7)=2, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=2`. 4 reds. No change.\n    *   Square @ `(7,2)`: `(7,2)=2, (7,3)=2, (8,2)=2, (8,3)=0`. 3 reds. Change `(8,3)` to 2.\n    *   Square @ `(7,3)`: `(7,3)=2, (7,4)=0, (8,3)=0, (8,4)=0`. 1 red. No change. (After previous step, `(8,3)` is 2). Recheck: `(7,3)=2, (7,4)=0, (8,3)=2, (8,4)=0`. 2 reds. No change.\n    *   Square @ `(8,6)`: `(8,6)=2, (8,7)=2, (9,6)=0, (9,7)=0`. 2 reds. No change.\n    *   **Intermediate Grid (Changes marked):**\n        "
