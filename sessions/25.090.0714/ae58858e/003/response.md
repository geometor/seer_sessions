  Transforms the input grid based on the following rule:
  1. Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
  2. If a pixel has the color red (2), check the four 2x2 squares it could belong to 
     (i.e., where the red pixel is the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right corner).
  3. For each of these four potential 2x2 squares, count the number of red (2) pixels within it using the input grid values. Handle boundary conditions where squares might extend beyond the grid edges.
  4. If ANY of these four potential 2x2 squares contains 3 or more red pixels, then change the color of the original pixel at this location to magenta (6) in the output grid.
  5. If a pixel was not originally red (2), or if it was red but did not meet the condition in step 4 (none of its associated 2x2 squares had 3 or more red pixels), its color remains unchanged in the output grid.
