Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of pixels with varying dimensions.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), and magenta (6). White pixels seem to act as the background and remain unchanged.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation specifically targets red (2) pixels. Some red pixels change to magenta (6) in the output, while others remain red.
4.  **Pattern Recognition:** By comparing input and output grids, the change from red (2) to magenta (6) consistently occurs where four red pixels form a 2x2 square in the input grid. All red pixels that are part of *any* such 2x2 square configuration change color.
5.  **Object Interaction:** The transformation doesn't depend on distinct "objects" in the traditional sense but rather on the local configuration of pixels. A single red pixel can be part of multiple overlapping 2x2 squares, and if it belongs to at least one, it changes color. Red pixels not part of any 2x2 red square remain unchanged.

**YAML Documentation:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors.
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Can be white (0), red (2), or magenta (6).
  - element: pattern
    type: local_configuration
    description: A 2x2 square composed entirely of red (2) pixels.
    location: Anywhere within the input grid.
  - element: transformation
    action: color_change
    input_color: red (2)
    output_color: magenta (6)
    condition: The red pixel must be part of at least one 2x2 square composed entirely of red pixels in the input grid.
    unchanged:
      - White (0) pixels remain white (0).
      - Red (2) pixels that are NOT part of any 2x2 red square remain red (2).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each possible top-left corner `(row, col)` of a 2x2 square within the input grid (i.e., from `row = 0` to `height - 2` and `col = 0` to `width - 2`).
3.  For each `(row, col)`, check if the pixels at `(row, col)`, `(row + 1, col)`, `(row, col + 1)`, and `(row + 1, col + 1)` in the *input* grid are all red (2).
4.  If all four pixels form a 2x2 red square, change the color of these corresponding four pixel locations in the *output* grid to magenta (6).
5.  After checking all possible 2x2 squares, the resulting output grid is the final answer. (Note: A pixel might be identified multiple times if it's part of overlapping 2x2 squares, but changing it to magenta repeatedly has no further effect).

**Revised Analysis based on Metrics:**

The code execution results reveal a significant discrepancy:

1.  **My initial code execution identified fewer 2x2 squares than expected.**
    *   Example 1: Code found 2 squares (`(1,5)`, `(7,2)`), but visual inspection and the Expected Output imply squares also exist at `(1,0)` and `(2,6)`. Let me check the input again for `(1,0)`: `input[1][0]=2`, `input[2][0]=0`. Ah! It's NOT a 2x2 red square. My initial visual scan was wrong. Let me re-check `(2,6)`: `input[2][6]=2`, `input[3][6]=2`, `input[2][7]=2`, `input[3][7]=2`. Yes, this is a 2x2 red square. My code missed this one. Why? Let's re-examine the code. The loop `for r in range(height - 1): for c in range(width - 1):` is correct. The check `all(p == 2 for p in pixels)` is correct. This is puzzling.
    *   Example 3: Code found 1 square `(0,0)`. Expected Output implies another one involving `(4,3)`, `(5,1)`, `(5,2)`, `(5,3)`. Let's check input: `input[4][3]=2`, `input[5][3]=2`, `input[4][2]=0`, `input[5][2]=2`. Not a square at `(4,2)`. How about `(5,1)`? `input[5][1]=2`, `input[5][2]=2`, `input[4][1]=0`. No. Let's check the only other potential `(5,2)`: `input[5][2]=2`, `input[5][3]=2`, `input[4][2]=0`, `input[4][3]=2`. Not a square. Okay, so the Expected Output for Ex3 changing `(4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)` to magenta must be based on some other rule or there's an error in the Expected Output.
    *   Example 4: Code found 0 squares. Expected Output has magenta pixels at `(2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6)`. Let's check input for `(2,6)`: `input[2][6]=2`, `input[3][6]=2`, `input[2][7]=2`, `input[3][7]=0`. Not a square. How about `(2,5)`? `input[2][5]=0`, `input[3][5]=2`. No. It seems the rule is *not* simply finding 2x2 red squares.

2.  **The number of unique red pixels involved in the *identified* 2x2 squares does not match the number of magenta pixels in the Expected Output.** This confirms the rule is more complex or different.

**Rethinking the Rule:**

Let's re-examine the *changes*.
*   Example 1: Squares at `(1,5)` and `(7,2)` and `(2,6)` change. Square starting at `(1,0)` also changes in the expected output. Pixels are `(1,0)=2`, `(1,1)=2`, `(2,0)=0`, `(2,1)=2`. What is special about these?
*   Example 3: Square at `(0,0)` changes. Pixels `(4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)` also change. Input: `(4,3)=2`, `(5,1)=2`, `(5,2)=2`, `(5,3)=2`. These are just individual red pixels, except for the group `(5,1), (5,2), (5,3)`.
*   Example 4: Pixels `(2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6)` change. Input: `(2,6)=2`, `(2,7)=2`, `(3,5)=2`, `(3,6)=2`. These form two adjacent horizontal pairs.

**New Hypothesis:** Maybe it's about finding a specific "L" or "corner" shape of three red pixels, and if that shape can be completed into a 2x2 red square *by adding one more red pixel*, then *all four* positions (even if the fourth wasn't red initially) become magenta? No, that doesn't fit Example 1 where `(2,0)` is white but `(1,0), (1,1), (2,1)` become magenta.

**Hypothesis 2: Identify all 2x2 squares where AT LEAST THREE pixels are red.** If such a square is found, change *all four* pixels in that 2x2 area in the output grid to magenta (6).

Let's test Hypothesis 2:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   `@ (1,0)`: `(1,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=2`. -> 3 red. -> Change `(1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)` to 6. (Wait, output shows `(2,0)` stays 0). Okay, Hypothesis 2 is wrong.
*   **Hypothesis 3: Identify all 2x2 squares where AT LEAST THREE pixels are red.** If such a square is found, change only the pixels within that 2x2 area *that were originally red* to magenta (6).
*   **Example 1 Test (Hypothesis 3):**
    *   `@ (1,0)`: `(1,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=2`. -> 3 red. Change `(1,0), (1,1), (2,1)` to 6. Output shows `(1,0)=6, (1,1)=6, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=6`. This matches!
    *   `@ (1,5)`: `(1,5)=2, (1,6)=2, (2,5)=2, (2,6)=2`. -> 4 red. Change `(1,5), (1,6), (2,5), (2,6)` to 6. Matches output.
    *   `@ (2,6)`: `(2,6)=2, (2,7)=2, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=2`. -> 4 red. Change `(2,6), (2,7), (3,6), (3,7)` to 6. Matches output.
    *   `@ (7,2)`: `(7,2)=2, (7,3)=2, (8,2)=2, (8,3)=0`. -> 3 red. Change `(7,2), (7,3), (8,2)` to 6. Output shows `(7,2)=6, (7,3)=6, (8,2)=6, (8,3)=0`. Matches! (Wait, checking expected output again: `(8,2)` is 6, `(8,3)` is 6. My analysis of the output was wrong. Let me re-check the square `(7,2)`). Input: `(7,2)=2, (7,3)=2, (8,2)=2, (8,3)=0`. Okay. Expected Output: `(7,2)=6, (7,3)=6, (8,2)=6, (8,3)=6`. This contradicts Hypothesis 3.
*   **Hypothesis 4: Identify any red pixel (2). Check the 3 potential 2x2 squares for which this pixel could be the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right corner. If *any* of those 2x2 squares contain 3 or more red pixels in the input, change the original red pixel to magenta (6) in the output.**
*   **Example 1 Test (Hypothesis 4):**
    *   Pixel `(1,0)` (red=2):
        *   Can be TL of `(1,0)` square: `(1,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=2`. (3 reds). Change `(1,0)` to 6.
    *   Pixel `(1,1)` (red=2):
        *   Can be TR of `(1,0)` square: `(1,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=2`. (3 reds). Change `(1,1)` to 6.
        *   Can be TL of `(1,1)` square: `(1,1)=2, (1,2)=0, (2,1)=2, (2,2)=0`. (2 reds). No change based on this square.
    *   Pixel `(2,1)` (red=2):
        *   Can be BL of `(1,1)` square: `(1,1)=2, (1,2)=0, (2,1)=2, (2,2)=0`. (2 reds). No change.
        *   Can be BR of `(1,0)` square: `(1,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=2`. (3 reds). Change `(2,1)` to 6.
    *   Pixel `(1,5)` (red=2):
        *   Can be TL of `(1,5)` square: `(1,5)=2, (1,6)=2, (2,5)=2, (2,6)=2`. (4 reds). Change `(1,5)` to 6.
    *   Pixel `(1,6)` (red=2):
        *   Can be TR of `(1,5)` square: (4 reds). Change `(1,6)` to 6.
        *   Can be TL of `(1,6)` square: `(1,6)=2, (1,7)=0, (2,6)=2, (2,7)=2`. (3 reds). Change `(1,6)` to 6 (already changed).
    *   Pixel `(2,5)` (red=2):
        *   Can be BL of `(1,5)` square: (4 reds). Change `(2,5)` to 6.
    *   Pixel `(2,6)` (red=2):
        *   Can be BR of `(1,5)` square: (4 reds). Change `(2,6)` to 6.
        *   Can be TR of `(2,5)` square: `(2,5)=2, (2,6)=2, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=2`. (3 reds). Change `(2,6)` to 6.
        *   Can be BL of `(1,6)` square: `(1,6)=2, (1,7)=0, (2,6)=2, (2,7)=2`. (3 reds). Change `(2,6)` to 6.
        *   Can be TL of `(2,6)` square: `(2,6)=2, (2,7)=2, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=2`. (4 reds). Change `(2,6)` to 6.
    *   ... This seems tedious but likely correct. Let's check a tricky pixel from the output: `(8,3)` becomes 6 in Example 1, but is 0 in the input. Hypothesis 4 *cannot* explain this.

**Hypothesis 5 (Back to Basics):** The first attempt (find 2x2 red squares, change all 4 pixels to magenta) seemed plausible but the reported "Transformed Output" was wrong. What if the *code* was right, and the *expected outputs* provided are the ground truth? Let's re-examine the connection between the inputs and the EXPECTED outputs directly, ignoring the previous failed code run.

*   **Rule:** Find all 2x2 squares in the input grid. If a 2x2 square contains **exactly 3** red pixels, change the location of the **non-red** pixel in that square to become red (2) in an intermediate grid. After checking all 2x2 squares, take this intermediate grid. Now, find all 2x2 squares in the *intermediate* grid that are entirely red (2). Change the pixels corresponding to these all-red 2x2 squares in the *final output grid* to magenta (6). All other pixels retain their color from the intermediate grid.

*   **Example 1 Test (Hypothesis 5):**
    *   Input Grid.
    *   Square @ `(1,0)`: `(1,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=2`. 3 reds. Change `(2,0)` to 2.
    *   Square @ `(1,5)`: `(1,5)=2, (1,6)=2, (2,5)=2, (2,6)=2`. 4 reds. No change.
    *   Square @ `(1,6)`: `(1,6)=2, (1,7)=0, (2,6)=2, (2,7)=2`. 3 reds. Change `(1,7)` to 2.
    *   Square @ `(2,5)`: `(2,5)=2, (2,6)=2, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=2`. 3 reds. Change `(3,5)` to 2.
    *   Square @ `(2,6)`: `(2,6)=2, (2,7)=2, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=2`. 4 reds. No change.
    *   Square @ `(7,2)`: `(7,2)=2, (7,3)=2, (8,2)=2, (8,3)=0`. 3 reds. Change `(8,3)` to 2.
    *   Square @ `(7,3)`: `(7,3)=2, (7,4)=0, (8,3)=0, (8,4)=0`. 1 red. No change. (After previous step, `(8,3)` is 2). Recheck: `(7,3)=2, (7,4)=0, (8,3)=2, (8,4)=0`. 2 reds. No change.
    *   Square @ `(8,6)`: `(8,6)=2, (8,7)=2, (9,6)=0, (9,7)=0`. 2 reds. No change.

        Let's re-trace carefully.
        Input:
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

        2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

        Check 2x2 for exactly 3 reds:
        - @(1,0): Input (1,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=2. Yes (3 reds). Non-red is (2,0). Mark (2,0) to change to 2.
        - @(1,6): Input (1,6)=2, (1,7)=0, (2,6)=2, (2,7)=2. Yes (3 reds). Non-red is (1,7). Mark (1,7) to change to 2.
        - @(7,2): Input (7,2)=2, (7,3)=2, (8,2)=2, (8,3)=0. Yes (3 reds). Non-red is (8,3). Mark (8,3) to change to 2.
        - @(8,2): Input (8,2)=2, (8,3)=0, (9,2)=0, (9,3)=0. 1 red. No.
        - @(7,6): Input (7,6)=0, (7,7)=0, (8,6)=2, (8,7)=2. 2 reds. No.
        Any others? Check around (5,1): @(5,1): (5,1)=2, (5,2)=2, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0. 2 reds. No. @(4,1): (4,1)=0, (4,2)=0, (5,1)=2, (5,2)=2. 2 reds. No.
        Okay, changes are: (2,0)->2, (1,7)->2, (8,3)->2.

        **Intermediate Grid:**

        2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

        Now find all 2x2 red squares in this intermediate grid:
        - @(1,1): (1,1)=2, (1,2)=0, (2,1)=2, (2,2)=2. No.
        - @(1,5): (1,5)=2, (1,6)=2, (2,5)=2, (2,6)=2. Yes! Mark (1,5),(1,6),(2,5),(2,6) for magenta.
        - @(1,6): (1,6)=2, (1,7)=2, (2,6)=2, (2,7)=0. No.
        - @(2,1): (2,1)=2, (2,2)=2, (3,1)=0, (3,2)=0. No.
        - @(2,6): (2,6)=2, (2,7)=0, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=2. No.
        - @(5,1): (5,1)=2, (5,2)=2, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0. No.
        - @(5,2): (5,2)=2, (5,3)=2, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0. No.
        - @(7,2): (7,2)=2, (7,3)=2, (8,2)=2, (8,3)=2. Yes! Mark (7,2),(7,3),(8,2),(8,3) for magenta.
        - @(8,6): (8,6)=2, (8,7)=2, (9,6)=0, (9,7)=0. No.
        Wait, did I miss the square at (2,6) from the input? Input: (2,6)=2, (2,7)=2, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=2. Yes, that's a 4-red square in the input. And it's still a 4-red square in the intermediate grid. So mark (2,6),(2,7),(3,6),(3,7) for magenta.

        What about the square at (1,0)? Intermediate: (1,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (2,0)=2, (2,1)=2. Yes! Mark (1,0),(1,1),(2,0),(2,1) for magenta.

        **Final Output Construction:** Start with Intermediate grid, change marked pixels to magenta.
        Output:
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        6* 6* 0 0 0 6* 6* 2*
        6* 6* 2 0 0 6* 6* 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 6* 6*

        2 0 6* 6* 0 0 2 2
        2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

        Let's compare this to the **Expected Output** for Example 1:
        ```

        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        6 6 0 0 0 6 6 0  <- Differs at (1,7) - Expected is 0, Mine is 2
