major_object:
  description: The largest contiguous area of any single non-white color (ignoring white/0).
  properties:
    - color: The color C of the pixels forming this object.
    - size: The count of pixels in the object.
    - location: The set of coordinates S = {(r, c), ...} occupied by the object.
  selection_criterion: Maximum size among all contiguous non-white objects. If multiple objects share the maximum size, the specific tie-breaking rule is currently undetermined but hasn't been necessary for these examples.
background_color: white (0)
enclosed_cells:
  description: Cells considered "inside" the major_object. These are cells that are not part of the major_object itself but cannot reach the boundary of the grid without crossing through a cell belonging to the major_object.
  identification:
    - Define the major_object's locations S as barriers.
    - Identify all cells not in S that are reachable from the grid boundary by moving horizontally or vertically only through cells not in S. Let this set be R (reachable).
    - Enclosed cells are all grid cells (r, c) such that (r, c) is not in S AND (r, c) is not in R.
  location: The set of coordinates E = {(r, c), ...} of these enclosed cells.
transformation:
  action: Fill enclosed cells.
  input: Original grid.
  output: Modified grid.
  rule:
    1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2. For each cell (r, c) identified as an enclosed_cell (i.e., in set E), set its color in the output grid to C (the color of the major_object).
    3. All other cells (those in S and those in R) retain their original color from the input grid.
