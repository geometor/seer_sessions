Any pixel, regardless of its original color (including white/background), that falls \"inside\" this boundary is changed to the color of the boundary block itself. Pixels outside this boundary, and pixels that are part of the boundary block, remain unchanged. The concept of \"inside\" is determined by whether a pixel, if treated as empty space (along with all other pixels not part of the largest block), can reach the edge of the grid without crossing the largest block.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
