*   **Perception:** The input grids consist of a white background (0) and several distinct objects made of azure pixels (8). The output grids preserve the shape and location of these azure objects but change their color. The color change appears to depend on the object's identity or order. Specifically, the second distinct azure object encountered when scanning the grid (typically top-to-bottom, left-to-right) is colored red (2), while all other azure objects are colored blue (1). The background remains white.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_properties:
        - background_color: white (0)
        - foreground_color: azure (8)
        - objects_are_contiguous: true
      input_features:
        - multiple_distinct_objects: true
          object_color: azure (8)
      output_features:
        - object_shapes_preserved: true
        - object_locations_preserved: true
        - object_colors_changed: true
          target_colors: [blue (1), red (2)]
          background_color_preserved: true
    transformation:
      description: Identify distinct azure objects and recolor them based on their order of appearance.
      steps:
        - identify_objects: Find all contiguous groups of azure (8) pixels.
        - determine_order: Establish an order for these objects, likely based on the top-most, left-most pixel of each object (scan order).
        - apply_recoloring:
            - Change the color of the second object found to red (2).
            - Change the color of all other azure objects to blue (1).
            - Keep the background white (0).
      relationships:
        - The output color of an azure pixel depends on which distinct object it belongs to and the order of that object among all azure objects in the input grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all separate, contiguous objects composed of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Consider pixels connected horizontally or vertically as part of the same object.
    2.  Determine the order of these objects by finding the top-most, left-most pixel of each object and sorting them first by row index, then by column index.
    3.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
    4.  Iterate through the identified azure objects based on the determined order.
    5.  For the second object in the sequence, change all its azure (8) pixels to red (2) in the output grid.
    6.  For all other objects (the first, third, fourth, etc.), change all their azure (8) pixels to blue (1) in the output grid.
    7.  Leave all white (0) background pixels unchanged.
