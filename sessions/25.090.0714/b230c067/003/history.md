*   **Perception:** The input grids consist of a white background (0) and several distinct objects made of azure pixels (8). The output grids preserve the shape and location of these azure objects but change their color. The color change appears to depend on the object's identity or order. Specifically, the second distinct azure object encountered when scanning the grid (typically top-to-bottom, left-to-right) is colored red (2), while all other azure objects are colored blue (1). The background remains white.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_properties:
        - background_color: white (0)
        - foreground_color: azure (8)
        - objects_are_contiguous: true
      input_features:
        - multiple_distinct_objects: true
          object_color: azure (8)
      output_features:
        - object_shapes_preserved: true
        - object_locations_preserved: true
        - object_colors_changed: true
          target_colors: [blue (1), red (2)]
          background_color_preserved: true
    transformation:
      description: Identify distinct azure objects and recolor them based on their order of appearance.
      steps:
        - identify_objects: Find all contiguous groups of azure (8) pixels.
        - determine_order: Establish an order for these objects, likely based on the top-most, left-most pixel of each object (scan order).
        - apply_recoloring:
            - Change the color of the second object found to red (2).
            - Change the color of all other azure objects to blue (1).
            - Keep the background white (0).
      relationships:
        - The output color of an azure pixel depends on which distinct object it belongs to and the order of that object among all azure objects in the input grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all separate, contiguous objects composed of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Consider pixels connected horizontally or vertically as part of the same object.
    2.  Determine the order of these objects by finding the top-most, left-most pixel of each object and sorting them first by row index, then by column index.
    3.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
    4.  Iterate through the identified azure objects based on the determined order.
    5.  For the second object in the sequence, change all its azure (8) pixels to red (2) in the output grid.
    6.  For all other objects (the first, third, fourth, etc.), change all their azure (8) pixels to blue (1) in the output grid.
    7.  Leave all white (0) background pixels unchanged.

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core task: finding azure (8) objects and recoloring them. The hypothesis that the *second* object in a simple top-left scan order should be colored red (2) was incorrect, as shown by the failures in Examples 1 and 2. Example 3 passing was coincidental under that initial hypothesis.

The failure analysis reveals that the rule for selecting the red object is more nuanced. Comparing the failing cases (1 & 2) with the passing case (3) suggests that properties of the objects themselves, rather than just their sequential order, determine the color mapping. Specifically, the *size* (number of pixels) of the objects appears crucial. The revised hypothesis is that the *smallest* azure object is colored red (2), and all others are colored blue (1). In case of a tie for the smallest size, the object whose top-left pixel comes first in a standard row-then-column scan order is chosen to be red.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's verify the object properties (coordinates, size, top-left pixel) for each example using the provided `find_objects` function.

**Corrected Metrics Interpretation:**

My manual count during hypothesis generation was slightly off. Let's re-evaluate the refined hypothesis using the accurate data from the code execution:

*   **Example 1:** Sizes are 8, 9, 9. Minimum size is 8. Only one object (top_left: (1, 6)) has this size. This object should be red. Matches expected output.
*   **Example 2:** Sizes are 8, 10, 10. Minimum size is 8. Only one object (top_left: (1, 7)) has this size. This object should be red. Matches expected output.
*   **Example 3:** Sizes are 5, 4, 5. Minimum size is 4. Only one object (top_left: (5, 0)) has this size. This object should be red. Matches expected output.

The refined hypothesis (smallest object is red, others are blue) holds true for all examples without needing the tie-breaking rule based on top-left coordinate, as there were no ties for the minimum size in these examples. The tie-breaking rule remains a plausible assumption for potential unseen cases but isn't strictly necessary based *only* on the provided training data. However, including it makes the rule more robust.

**YAML Facts:**

  description: Identify distinct azure objects, find the one with the minimum pixel count, color it red, and color all others blue.
  steps:
    - identify_objects: Find all contiguous groups of azure (8) pixels.
    - calculate_sizes: Determine the number of pixels (size) for each identified object.
    - find_smallest: Identify the minimum size among all objects.
    - select_target_object:
        - Find all objects that have the minimum size.
        - If only one object has the minimum size, select it.
        - If multiple objects share the minimum size, select the one whose top-most, left-most pixel appears first when scanning the grid (sorted by row, then column).
    - apply_recoloring:
        - Change the color of the selected target object's pixels to red (2).
        - Change the color of all other azure objects' pixels to blue (1).
        - Keep the background white (0).
  relationships:
    - The output color of an azure pixel depends on whether the object it belongs to is the unique smallest object (or the first smallest object in scan order in case of ties).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all separate, contiguous objects composed of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Use horizontal and vertical adjacency for defining contiguity.
2.  For each identified object, calculate its size by counting the number of azure pixels it contains. Also, determine the coordinate of its top-most, left-most pixel.
3.  Find the minimum size among all the calculated object sizes.
4.  Create a list of all objects that have this minimum size.
5.  Sort this list of minimum-sized objects based on their top-most, left-most pixel coordinates (first by row index, then by column index).
6.  Select the first object from this sorted list as the designated "target object".
7.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
8.  Iterate through all originally identified azure objects:
    *   If the current object is the designated "target object", change all its azure (8) pixels to red (2) in the output grid.
    *   Otherwise (if it's any other azure object), change all its azure (8) pixels to blue (1) in the output grid.
9.  Leave all white (0) background pixels unchanged.
