            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core task: finding azure (8) objects and recoloring them. The hypothesis that the *second* object in a simple top-left scan order should be colored red (2) was incorrect, as shown by the failures in Examples 1 and 2. Example 3 passing was coincidental under that initial hypothesis.\n\nThe failure analysis reveals that the rule for selecting the red object is more nuanced. Comparing the failing cases (1 & 2) with the passing case (3) suggests that properties of the objects themselves, rather than just their sequential order, determine the color mapping. Specifically, the *size* (number of pixels) of the objects appears crucial. The revised hypothesis is that the *smallest* azure object is colored red (2), and all others are colored blue (1). In case of a tie for the smallest size, the object whose top-left pixel comes first in a standard row-then-column scan order is chosen to be red.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's verify the object properties (coordinates, size, top-left pixel) for each example using the provided `find_objects` function.\n\n"

Let's re-evaluate the refined hypothesis using the accurate data from the code execution:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Sizes are 8, 9, 9. Minimum size is 8. Only one object (top_left: (1, 6)) has this size. This object should be red. Matches expected output.\n*   **Example 2:** Sizes are 8, 10, 10. Minimum size is 8. Only one object (top_left: (1, 7)) has this size. This object should be red. Matches expected output.\n*   **Example 3:** Sizes are 5, 4, 5. Minimum size is 4. Only one object (top_left: (5, 0)) has this size. This object should be red. Matches expected output.\n\nThe refined hypothesis (smallest object is red, others are blue) holds true for all examples without needing the tie-breaking rule based on top-left coordinate, as there were no ties for the minimum size in these examples. The tie-breaking rule remains a plausible assumption for potential unseen cases but isn't strictly necessary based *only* on the provided training data. However, including it makes the rule more robust.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
