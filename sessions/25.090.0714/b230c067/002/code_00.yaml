  description: Identify distinct azure objects, find the one with the minimum pixel count, color it red, and color all others blue.
  steps:
    - identify_objects: Find all contiguous groups of azure (8) pixels.
    - calculate_sizes: Determine the number of pixels (size) for each identified object.
    - find_smallest: Identify the minimum size among all objects.
    - select_target_object:
        - Find all objects that have the minimum size.
        - If only one object has the minimum size, select it.
        - If multiple objects share the minimum size, select the one whose top-most, left-most pixel appears first when scanning the grid (sorted by row, then column).
    - apply_recoloring:
        - Change the color of the selected target object's pixels to red (2).
        - Change the color of all other azure objects' pixels to blue (1).
        - Keep the background white (0).
  relationships:
    - The output color of an azure pixel depends on whether the object it belongs to is the unique smallest object (or the first smallest object in scan order in case of ties).
