    *   The most frequent color in the right half is yellow (4). The most frequent in the left half is also yellow (4).
    *   This doesn't directly explain the output. The left half *becomes* uniformly yellow (4), which matches the most frequent color there. But the right half *doesn't* become uniformly yellow (4).

    *   **Alternative idea:** Maybe the transformation identifies "noise" pixels and replaces them? What defines noise?
    *   Let's consider the left half (columns 0-4). The output is all yellow (4). Is yellow (4) special in the input's left half? It's the most frequent color. Perhaps the rule for the left half is: "Find the most frequent color in columns 0-4 and fill columns 0-4 of the output with that color."

    *   Now consider the right half (columns 5-9). The output retains maroon (9), gray (5), and azure (8). Yellow (4) is removed. Is yellow (4) noise in the right half? It *is* the most frequent color there. This is counter-intuitive.
    *   What if the rule is about stability or neighbours?
    *   Look at the single Azure (8) pixel at input[8, 9]. Its neighbors (in the full grid) are:
        
```
        4 5 4
        4 4 8  <- The 8 itself
        9 5 4
        ```

        Neighbors: 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 9, 5, 4. Count: {4: 6, 5: 2, 9: 1}. Yellow (4) is dominant.
        In the output, this pixel is still 8, and the one above it also becomes 8.
        Output[8, 9] = 5. Output[7, 9] = 5. Ah, wait, the output I transcribed above is wrong. Let me get it from the prompt again.
        Output:
        
```
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 8
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 8
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 5  <- Output[8, 9] is 5 (gray)
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 5  <- Output[9, 9] is 5 (gray)
        ```

        The Azure (8) pixels are at Output[0, 9] and Output[1, 9]. Where did they come from? The *input* has an Azure (8) at Input[8, 9]. This doesn't seem connected.
        Let me re-examine the input grid. There's an Azure (8) at Input[0, 2] and Input[8, 9].
        
```
        Input:
        4 4 8 9 4 | 9 4 4 9 4
        4 9 4 4 5 | 4 4 9 5 4
        5 9 9 4 5 | 9 4 5 9 4
        5 9 4 4 5 | 9 4 9 4 4
        5 9 4 9 4 | 4 4 5 4 4
        5 9 4 9 4 | 4 9 4 5 4
        5 9 4 5 4 | 5 5 9 4 4
        5 9 4 9 4 | 5 9 9 4 9
        5 9 4 9 4 | 4 9 5 4 8  <- Azure here
        4 9 4 4 9 | 4 9 5 4 4
        ```

        Output:
        
```
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 8  <- Azure here
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 8  <- Azure here
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 5
        ```

        This is confusing. The Azure location seems to shift completely.
        What if the transformation isn't pixel-wise based on neighbors, but column-wise or region-wise?

    *   **Revisit `train_2`:** Let's see if the second example clarifies things.
        Input `train_2`:
        
```
        2 6 6 6 6 | 5 6 6 6 6
        2 6 2 6 6 | 5 2 6 2 6
        6 5 2 6 2 | 5 2 5 2 2
        6 6 6 6 2 | 5 6 5 6 2
        6 2 6 6 2 | 6 6 6 6 2
        8 2 6 5 6 | 6 2 8 6 8
        5 2 2 5 6 | 6 2 6 6 8
        5 2 2 5 2 | 2 6 6 2 6
        6 2 6 6 2 | 8 6 5 2 6
        6 2 6 6 2 | 8 6 5 6 6
        ```

        Output `train_2`:
        
```
        6 6 6 6 6 | 2 2 2 5 8
        6 6 6 6 6 | 2 2 2 5 8
        6 6 6 6 6 | 2 2 2 5 8
        6 6 6 6 6 | 2 2 2 5 8

        6 6 6 6 6 | 2 2 2 5 8
        6 6 6 6 6 | 2 2 2 5 5
        6 6 6 6 6 | 2 2 2 5 5
        6 6 6 6 6 | 2 2 2 5 5
        6 6 6 6 6 | 6 2 2 5 5 <- Note the 6 here
        ```

    *   Again, the grid is 10x10. It seems split into columns 0-4 and 5-9.
    *   Left half (cols 0-4) becomes uniformly magenta (6). Let's find the most frequent color in the input's left half.

        *   The most frequent color in the input's left half is magenta (6), which matches the output's left half. This supports the hypothesis: **Rule for Left Half: Fill with the most frequent color found in the input's left half.**

    *   Now, the right half (cols 5-9) of `train_2`.
        Input: Mixed colors (5, 6, 2, 8). Most frequent is 6 (magenta).
        Output: Mostly red (2), gray (5), azure (8), with one magenta (6) at the bottom left corner of this half (output[9, 5]).
        *   This output does *not* seem related to the most frequent color (6) in the input's right half.
        *   The output again looks "smoothed" or "simplified".
        *   The colors present in the output's right half (2, 5, 8, 6) are all present in the input's right half.
        *   Is it possible the rule involves identifying certain "stable" or "significant" pixels/regions in the input's right half and propagating them?

    *   Let's re-examine the structure of the output right half for `train_2`:
        
```
        2 2 2 5 8
        2 2 2 5 8
        2 2 2 5 8
        2 2 2 5 8
        2 2 2 5 8
        2 2 2 5 8
        2 2 2 5 5
        2 2 2 5 5
        2 2 2 5 5
        6 2 2 5 5
        ```

        It's composed of vertical columns of solid color, except for the bottom part of the last two columns and the single '6' pixel.
        *   Col 5: Mostly 2, one 6 at the bottom.
        *   Col 6: All 2.
        *   Col 7: All 2.
        *   Col 8: Mostly 5.
        *   Col 9: Mostly 8, then 5.

    *   Compare output columns 5-9 to input columns 5-9.
        *   Input Col 5: `5 5 5 5 6 6 6 2 8 8` -> Output Col 5: `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 6` (Mostly 2)
        *   Input Col 6: `6 2 2 6 6 2 2 6 6 6` -> Output Col 6: `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2` (All 2)
        *   Input Col 7: `6 6 5 5 6 8 6 6 5 5` -> Output Col 7: `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2` (All 2)
        *   Input Col 8: `6 2 2 6 6 6 6 2 2 5` -> Output Col 8: `5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5` (All 5)
        *   Input Col 9: `6 6 2 2 2 8 8 6 6 6` -> Output Col 9: `8 8 8 8 8 8 5 5 5 5` (Mostly 8, then 5)

    *   Is there a "dominant" color per column in the input's right half that determines the output column?
        *   Input Col 5: Counts: {5: 4, 6: 3, 8: 2, 2: 1}. Most frequent: 5. Output: Mostly 2. Doesn't fit.
        *   Input Col 6: Counts: {6: 6, 2: 4}. Most frequent: 6. Output: All 2. Doesn't fit.
        *   Input Col 7: Counts: {6: 5, 5: 4, 8: 1}. Most frequent: 6. Output: All 2. Doesn't fit.
        *   Input Col 8: Counts: {6: 5, 2: 4, 5: 1}. Most frequent: 6. Output: All 5. Doesn't fit.
        *   Input Col 9: Counts: {6: 5, 2: 3, 8: 2}. Most frequent: 6. Output: Mostly 8, then 5. Doesn't fit.

    *   **New Hypothesis:** Maybe the task involves identifying "objects" and their properties. What are the objects? Contiguous blocks of non-background color?
    *   In `train_1`, yellow (4) seems like a background or default color.
    *   In `train_2`, magenta (6) seems like a background or default color.
    *   In both cases, the left half of the output grid is filled with the most frequent color from the input's left half. Let's call this the "background color" for the left side.

    *   What about the right side?
    *   In `train_1`, the right side input has colors 4, 9, 5, 8. Yellow (4) is the most frequent. The output has 9, 5, 8. Yellow (4) is removed.
    *   In `train_2`, the right side input has colors 5, 6, 2, 8. Magenta (6) is the most frequent. The output has 2, 5, 8, 6.
    *   It seems the rule for the right half might be:
        1. Identify the most frequent color in the input's *right* half. Let's call this `right_bg`.
        2. Create a temporary grid containing only the *non* `right_bg` colors from the input's right half, preserving their positions. Other cells are empty/marked.
        3. Process this temporary grid to generate the output's right half. How?
            *   Maybe fill empty cells based on neighbors?
            *   Maybe find the largest remaining objects and fill columns/regions based on them?

    *   Let's try this on `train_1`:
        1. Input right half (cols 5-9): `4 4 8 9 4 9 4 4 9 4`, `4 9 4 4 5 4 4 5 9 4`, ... Most frequent is 4 (yellow). `right_bg = 4`.
        2. Temporary grid (replace 4 with 0 - white/empty):
           
```
           9 0 0 9 0
           0 0 9 5 0
           9 9 0 9 0
           9 0 0 9 0
           0 0 0 5 0
           0 9 0 5 0
           5 5 9 0 0
           5 9 9 0 9
           0 0 5 0 8
           0 9 9 5 0
           ```

        3. Process this grid to get the output right half:
           
```
           9 9 9 5 8
           9 9 9 5 8
           9 9 9 5 5
           9 9 9 5 5
           9 9 9 5 5
           9 9 9 5 5
           9 9 9 5 5
           9 9 9 5 5
           9 9 9 5 5
           9 9 9 5 5
           ```

           How does the temporary grid transform into this?
           *   Column 0 of temp has 9s and 5s. Output col 0 is all 9s.
           *   Column 1 of temp has 9s and 5s. Output col 1 is all 9s.
           *   Column 2 of temp has 9s and 5s. Output col 2 is all 9s.
           *   Column 3 of temp has 9s and 5s. Output col 3 is all 5s.
           *   Column 4 of temp has 9 and 8. Output col 4 is two 8s then all 5s.
           This looks like: For each column in the temporary grid, find the *most frequent non-zero color* in that column. Fill the output column with that color. If there's a tie or no non-zero colors? Maybe use a default or look at neighbors? What about the Azure (8)? It's unique in its column (col 4).
           Let's re-check counts per column in the temp grid:
           *   Col 0: {9: 4, 5: 3}. Most frequent: 9. -> Output: 9. Fits.
           *   Col 1: {9: 4, 5: 1}. Most frequent: 9. -> Output: 9. Fits.
           *   Col 2: {9: 4, 5: 1}. Most frequent: 9. -> Output: 9. Fits.
           *   Col 3: {9: 3, 5: 5}. Most frequent: 5. -> Output: 5. Fits.
           *   Col 4: {9: 2, 8: 1}. Most frequent: 9. -> Output: two 8s then 5s. Doesn't fit.

    *   **Refined Hypothesis for Right Half:**
        1. Determine the background color (`right_bg`) for the input's right half (most frequent color).
        2. Create the output's right half grid.
        3. Iterate through each *column* `j` (from 5 to 9) of the input grid.
        4. Find all non-`right_bg` colors present in that input column `j`.
        5. If there are *any* non-`right_bg` colors:
           a. Find the *highest* non-`right_bg` pixel in that column `j`. Let its color be `C_top`.
           b. Find the *lowest* non-`right_bg` pixel in that column `j`. Let its color be `C_bot`.
           c. Fill the output column corresponding to `j` (from row 0 down to the row of `C_top`) with color `C_top`.
           d. Fill the rest of the output column (from row `C_top` + 1 to the bottom) with color `C_bot`.
        6. If a column `j` in the input's right half contains *only* the `right_bg` color, what happens? (Need to check examples).

    *   Let's test this refined hypothesis on `train_1` right half:
        *   `right_bg = 4` (yellow).
        *   Input Col 5 (index 5): `9 4 9 9 4 4 5 5 4 4`. Non-bg: 9, 9, 9, 5, 5. Highest is 9 (row 0). Lowest is 5 (row 7). `C_top = 9`, `C_bot = 5`. Output col 5: Row 0 is 9. Rows 1-9 are 5. --> `9 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5`. **Doesn't match output** (`9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9`).

    *   **Let's rethink the right half processing.** Maybe it's about objects, not just columns.
    *   Consider `train_1` again. Output right half:
        
```
        9 9 9 5 8
        9 9 9 5 8
        9 9 9 5 5
        ...
        ```

        It looks like blocks of color. Maroon (9) block, Gray (5) block, Azure (8) pixels.
    *   Where could these come from? In the input's right half, ignore the background yellow (4).
        
```
           9 . . 9 .
           . . 9 5 .
           9 9 . 9 .
           9 . . 9 .
           . . . 5 .
           . 9 . 5 .
           5 5 9 . .
           5 9 9 . 9
           . . 5 . 8
           . 9 9 5 .
        ```

        Maybe find the largest contiguous object of each non-background color?
        *   Maroon (9): Several disconnected blobs. Largest seems to be the one around (2,0), (3,0), (2,1), etc.
        *   Gray (5): Several blobs. Largest around (6,0), (6,1), (7,0), (8,2), (9,3).
        *   Azure (8): Single pixel at (8,4).

    *   This isn't leading anywhere simple. Let's simplify.
    *   **Overall Pattern:** Divide input grid vertically at the middle column index (index 5 for a 10-col grid). Process left and right halves independently to produce the output halves.
    *   **Left Half Rule:** Find the most frequent color in the input's left half. Fill the output's left half entirely with this color.
    *   **Right Half Rule:** This is the tricky part.
        *   Observe `train_1` output right half: Columns 5, 6, 7 are all Maroon (9). Column 8 is all Gray (5). Column 9 is two Azure (8) then Gray (5).
        *   Observe `train_2` output right half: Column 5 is mostly Red (2) with one Magenta (6). Columns 6, 7 are Red (2). Column 8 is Gray (5). Column 9 is mostly Azure (8) then Gray (5).
        *   The output columns seem determined column-by-column based *somehow* on the input columns.
        *   Maybe it involves the *topmost* non-background color in each input column?
            *   `train_1` right half (`bg=4`):
                *   Col 5: Top non-bg is 9 (row 0). Output col 5 is all 9. OK.
                *   Col 6: Top non-bg is 9 (row 2). Output col 6 is all 9. OK.
                *   Col 7: Top non-bg is 5 (row 1). Output col 7 is all 9. NO.
                *   Col 8: Top non-bg is 9 (row 0). Output col 8 is all 5. NO.
                *   Col 9: Top non-bg is 8 (row 8). Output col 9 starts with 8. Maybe?
            *   `train_2` right half (`bg=6`):
                *   Col 5: Top non-bg is 5 (row 0). Output col 5 starts with 2. NO.
                *   Col 6: Top non-bg is 2 (row 1). Output col 6 is all 2. OK.
                *   Col 7: Top non-bg is 5 (row 2). Output col 7 is all 2. NO.
                *   Col 8: Top non-bg is 2 (row 1). Output col 8 is all 5. NO.
                *   Col 9: Top non-bg is 2 (row 2). Output col 9 starts with 8. NO.

    *   **Let's reconsider the "background" definition.** Maybe it's not the most frequent color?
    *   What if the rule is about "cleaning" the grid?
    *   Look at the transformation row by row? No obvious row patterns.
    *   Look at the transformation column by column? We tried that.
    *   Look at the whole grid?
    *   **Hypothesis 3:**
        1.  Divide the input grid vertically into two halves (left: cols 0-4, right: cols 5-9).
        2.  **Left Half Processing:** Find the most frequent color `C_left` in the input's left half. Fill the output's left half (cols 0-4) completely with `C_left`.
        3.  **Right Half Processing:**
            a.  Find the most frequent color `C_right_bg` in the input's right half.
            b.  Initialize the output's right half as a copy of the input's right half.
            c.  Iterate through the cells `(r, c)` where `c >= 5`. If the color at `input[r, c]` is `C_right_bg`, change the color at `output[r, c]` based on some rule (maybe neighbor-based fill?).
            d.  This seems like "removing" the background color and letting the other colors "fill in".

    *   Let's test step 3 on `train_1`: `C_right_bg = 4` (yellow).
        Input right half:
        
```
        9 4 4 9 4
        4 4 9 5 4
        9 9 4 9 4
        9 4 4 9 4
        4 4 4 5 4
        4 9 4 5 4
        5 5 9 4 4
        5 9 9 4 9
        4 4 5 4 8
        4 9 9 5 4
        ```

        Output right half:
        
```
        9 9 9 5 8
        9 9 9 5 8
        9 9 9 5 5
        9 9 9 5 5
        9 9 9 5 5
        9 9 9 5 5
        9 9 9 5 5
        9 9 9 5 5
        9 9 9 5 5
        9 9 9 5 5
        ```

        If we replace the yellow (4) pixels in the input right half, how do they get filled to produce the output?
        Consider input[0, 6] = 4. Its neighbors are 4, 9, 5 (input right half only). Output[0, 6] = 9.
        Consider input[0, 7] = 4. Its neighbors are 9, 4, 9 (input right half only). Output[0, 7] = 9.
        Consider input[1, 5] = 4. Its neighbors are 9, 4, 9 (input right half only). Output[1, 5] = 9.
        Consider input[8, 5] = 4. Its neighbors are 5, 9, 5 (input right half only). Output[8, 5] = 9.
        Consider input[8, 6] = 4. Its neighbors are 9, 4, 9 (input right half only). Output[8, 6] = 9.

        This looks like a "fill" operation. When a cell in the input right half has the background color (`C_right_bg`), its corresponding output cell takes the color of the *nearest non-background* cell in the input right half? Or maybe the most frequent non-background neighbor?

        Let's refine:
        3. **Right Half Processing:**
           a. Find the most frequent color `C_right_bg` in the input's right half (cols >= 5).
           b. Create the output right half grid.
           c. For each cell `(r, c)` with `c >= 5`:
              i. If `input[r, c]` is *not* equal to `C_right_bg`, then `output[r, c] = input[r, c]`.
              ii. If `input[r, c]` *is* equal to `C_right_bg`, find the color `C_fill` to use for `output[r, c]`. The rule for `C_fill` might be: look at the 8 neighbors of `(r, c)` in the *input* grid (within the right half). Find the most frequent *non* `C_right_bg` color among the neighbors. If there's a tie, maybe default to the color of the cell directly above? Or the top-most, left-most neighbor?

    *   Let's test the neighbor rule on `train_1`, `C_right_bg = 4`.
        *   `input[0, 6] = 4`. Neighbors in right half: `input[0, 5]=9`, `input[1, 5]=4`, `input[1, 6]=4`, `input[1, 7]=9`, `input[0, 7]=4`. Non-bg neighbors: 9, 9. Most frequent non-bg neighbor is 9. `output[0, 6] = 9`. Matches.
        *   `input[0, 7] = 4`. Neighbors in right half: `input[0, 6]=4`, `input[1, 6]=4`, `input[1, 7]=9`, `input[1, 8]=5`, `input[0, 8]=9`. Non-bg neighbors: 9, 5, 9. Most frequent non-bg neighbor is 9. `output[0, 7] = 9`. Matches.
        *   `input[1, 5] = 4`. Neighbors in right half: `input[0, 5]=9`, `input[0, 6]=4`, `input[1, 6]=4`, `input[2, 6]=4`, `input[2, 5]=9`. Non-bg neighbors: 9, 9. Most frequent is 9. `output[1, 5] = 9`. Matches.
        *   `input[8, 5] = 4`. Neighbors in right half: `input[7, 5]=5`, `input[9, 5]=4`, `input[9, 6]=9`, `input[8, 6]=4`, `input[7, 6]=9`. Non-bg neighbors: 5, 9, 9. Most frequent is 9. `output[8, 5] = 9`. Matches.
        *   `input[8, 6] = 4`. Neighbors in right half: `input[7, 5]=5`, `input[8, 5]=4`, `input[9, 5]=4`, `input[9, 6]=9`, `input[9, 7]=9`, `input[8, 7]=5`, `input[7, 7]=9`. Non-bg neighbors: 5, 9, 9, 5, 9. Most frequent is 9. `output[8, 6] = 9`. Matches.
        *   `input[8, 8] = 4`. Neighbors in right half: `input[7, 7]=9`, `input[8, 7]=5`, `input[9, 7]=9`, `input[9, 8]=5`, `input[9, 9]=4`, `input[8, 9]=8`, `input[7, 9]=9`, `input[7, 8]=4`. Non-bg neighbors: 9, 5, 9, 5, 8, 9. Most frequent is 9 (3 times), then 5 (2 times), then 8 (1 time). Output[8, 8] is 5. **Doesn't match.**

    *   The simple "most frequent non-background neighbor" rule fails.
    *   What if ties are broken by proximity? Or by color value? Or position (e.g., prefer neighbor above)?
    *   Let's reconsider `input[8, 8]=4`. Non-bg neighbors: N/A, NE=9, E=8, SE=4(bg), S=5, SW=9, W=5, NW=9. Colors: {9: 3, 5: 2, 8: 1}. Output is 5. Why 5? Maybe the neighbor at (9, 8) which is 5? Or the neighbor at (8, 7) which is 5?
    *   What about `input[0, 9]=4`. Neighbors in right half: `input[0, 8]=9`, `input[1, 8]=5`, `input[1, 9]=4`. Non-bg neighbors: 9, 5. Tie. Output is 8. Where does 8 come from? The only 8 is at `input[8, 9]`. This suggests something non-local or iterative.

    *   **Final Hypothesis Structure:**
        1. Divide input into left/right halves (cols 0-4, 5-9).
        2. Process Left: Fill output left half with the most frequent color from input left half.
        3. Process Right:
           a. Find the most frequent color `C_right_bg` in input right half.
           b. Create a temporary grid T1, copy of input right half.
           c. Create a target grid T2, initialized same as T1.
           d. Repeat N times or until T2 stabilizes:
              i. For each cell `(r, c)` in T2:
                 - If `T1[r, c]` was *not* `C_right_bg`, `T2[r, c]` remains `T1[r, c]`. (Anchor points)
                 - If `T1[r, c]` *was* `C_right_bg`, calculate the new color for `T2[r, c]` based on its neighbors in the *previous* state of T2. Rule: Find the most frequent color among the 8 neighbors in the previous state. If `C_right_bg` is the most frequent neighbor, try the next most frequent. If still tied, use a tie-breaker (e.g., lowest color index? Closest neighbor? Pixel above?).
              ii. Update T2 for the next iteration.
           e. The final state of T2 is the output right half.

    *   This iterative "Cellular Automaton"-like process seems plausible for the smoothing/filling effect. The "anchor points" are the non-background pixels from the original input right half. The background pixels get filled based on their neighbors iteratively.
    *   Tie-breaking is still unclear. Let's try "most frequent neighbor color, excluding `C_right_bg`. If tie, use the color with the lowest numerical value."
    *   Test `input[8, 8]=4` (`train_1`). `C_right_bg=4`. Neighbors: {9: 3, 5: 2, 8: 1}. Exclude 4. Frequencies: {9: 3, 5: 2, 8: 1}. Most frequent is 9. Output is 5. Doesn't work.
    *   Try tie-breaking: "lowest color index". Neighbors: 9, 5, 8. Lowest is 5. Output is 5. OK!
    *   Test `input[0, 9]=4`. Neighbors: {9: 1, 5: 1}. Tie. Lowest color index is 5. Output is 8. Doesn't work.

    *   Maybe the tie-breaker is positional? Prefer color above?
    *   `input[8, 8]=4`. Neighbor above is `input[7, 8]=4` (bg).
    *   `input[0, 9]=4`. Neighbor above doesn't exist.

    *   **Let's focus on the structure:** The output seems to be formed by vertical bands in the right half.
        `train_1`: Col 5-7 are 9. Col 8 is 5. Col 9 is 8/5.
        `train_2`: Col 5 mostly 2. Col 6-7 are 2. Col 8 is 5. Col 9 is 8/5.
    *   Could the rule be simpler? For each column `j` in the right half:
        1. Find most frequent color `C_right_bg` for the whole right half.
        2. Find the most frequent *non-bg* color `C_col` in input column `j`.
        3. Fill output column `j` with `C_col`?
        *   `train_1`: `C_right_bg=4`.
            *   Col 5: Non-bg `9,9,9,5,5`. Freq: {9:3, 5:2}. Most freq non-bg = 9. Output Col 5 = 9. OK.
            *   Col 6: Non-bg `9,9`. Freq: {9:2}. Most freq non-bg = 9. Output Col 6 = 9. OK.
            *   Col 7: Non-bg `5,9,5,9`. Freq: {5:2, 9:2}. Tie. Output Col 7 = 9. How is tie broken? Lowest index=5. Doesn't fit. Maybe highest index=9? OK.
            *   Col 8: Non-bg `9,5,9,9,5,5`. Freq: {9:3, 5:3}. Tie. Output Col 8 = 5. How? Lowest index=5. OK.
            *   Col 9: Non-bg `9,8`. Freq: {9:1, 8:1}. Tie. Output Col 9 = 8/5. Doesn't fit simple fill.

    *   The simple column fill based on most frequent non-background color (with some tie-breaker) almost works but fails on ties and column 9. Column 9 seems special.

    *   **Revised Right Half Hypothesis:**
        1. Find `C_right_bg` (most frequent color in input right half).
        2. For each column `j` (5 to 8):
           a. Find frequencies of non-`C_right_bg` colors in input column `j`.
           b. If no non-`C_right_bg` colors, maybe fill with `C_right_bg`? (Check examples - doesn't seem to happen here).
           c. Determine the dominant color `C_dom` for the column: the non-`C_right_bg` color with the highest frequency.
           d. Break ties: If counts are equal, choose the color with the *lowest numerical value*.
           e. Fill output column `j` entirely with `C_dom`.
        3. For the last column (column 9):
           a. Find the highest non-`C_right_bg` pixel: `input[r_top, 9] = C_top`.
           b. Find the lowest non-`C_right_bg` pixel: `input[r_bot, 9] = C_bot`.
           c. Fill output column 9 from row 0 to `r_top` with `C_top`.
           d. Fill output column 9 from row `r_top + 1` to end with `C_bot`. (This assumes `r_top <= r_bot` and both exist).

    *   Test this full hypothesis:
        *   **`train_1`**: `C_left = 4`. `C_right_bg = 4`.
            *   Output Left Half: All 4. OK.
            *   Right Half:
                *   Col 5: Non-bg {9:3, 5:2}. Max freq=9. `C_dom=9`. Output Col 5 = 9. OK.
                *   Col 6: Non-bg {9:2}. Max freq=9. `C_dom=9`. Output Col 6 = 9. OK.
                *   Col 7: Non-bg {5:2, 9:2}. Tie. Lowest index = 5. `C_dom=5`. Output Col 7 = 5. **FAILS** (Output is 9). --> Maybe tie-break is *highest* numerical value? If tie-break=highest value: `C_dom=9`. Output Col 7 = 9. OK.
                *   Col 8: Non-bg {9:3, 5:3}. Tie. Highest value = 9. `C_dom=9`. Output Col 8 = 9. **FAILS** (Output is 5). --> Tie-break rule inconsistent. Let's stick to lowest value for now. Col 7 fails, Col 8 fails (if tie break=lowest value).

        *   **Let's rethink the tie break.** Could it be related to the *position* of the tied colors?
            *   Col 7: `5 @ r=1`, `9 @ r=2`, `5 @ r=6`, `9 @ r=7`. Tied 5s and 9s. Output is 9. The highest 9 is @ r=2. The highest 5 is @ r=1. Highest overall non-bg is 5.
            *   Col 8: `9 @ r=0`, `5 @ r=1`, `9 @ r=3`, `9 @ r=6`, `5 @ r=8`, `5 @ r=9`. Tied 9s and 5s. Output is 5. Highest 9 is @ r=0. Highest 5 is @ r=1. Highest overall non-bg is 9.

        *   Maybe the tie-breaker is: Choose the color that appears *highest* (minimum row index) in the column?
            *   Col 7: 5 appears at r=1, 9 appears at r=2. Highest is 5. `C_dom=5`. Output is 9. NO.
            *   Col 8: 9 appears at r=0, 5 appears at r=1. Highest is 9. `C_dom=9`. Output is 5. NO.

        *   Maybe the tie-breaker is: Choose the color that appears *lowest* (maximum row index) in the column?
            *   Col 7: 5 last appears at r=6, 9 last appears at r=7. Lowest is 9. `C_dom=9`. Output is 9. OK.
            *   Col 8: 9 last appears at r=6, 5 last appears at r=9. Lowest is 5. `C_dom=5`. Output is 5. OK.
            *   **New Tie-Breaker:** If frequencies are tied, choose the color whose lowest instance (max row index) in the column is lower (larger row index) than the other tied colors.

        *   Let's re-test rule for cols 5-8 with this tie-breaker:
            *   Col 5: {9:3, 5:2}. `C_dom=9`. Output Col 5 = 9. OK.
            *   Col 6: {9:2}. `C_dom=9`. Output Col 6 = 9. OK.
            *   Col
