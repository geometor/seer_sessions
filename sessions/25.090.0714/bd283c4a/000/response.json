(Anchor points)\n                 - If `T1[r, c]` *was* `C_right_bg`, calculate the new color for `T2[r, c]` based on its neighbors in the *previous* state of T2. Rule: Find the most frequent color among the 8 neighbors in the previous state. If `C_right_bg` is the most frequent neighbor, try the next most frequent. If still tied, use a tie-breaker (e.g., lowest color index? Closest neighbor? Pixel above?).\n              ii. Update T2 for the next iteration.\n           e. The final state of T2 is the output right half.\n\n    *   This iterative \"Cellular Automaton\"-like process seems plausible for the smoothing/filling effect. The \"anchor points\" are the non-background pixels from the original input right half. The background pixels get filled based on their neighbors iteratively.\n    *   Tie-breaking is still unclear. Let's try \"most frequent neighbor color, excluding `C_right_bg`. If tie, use the color with the lowest numerical value.\"\n    *   Test `input[8, 8]=4` (`train_1`). `C_right_bg=4`. Neighbors: {9: 3, 5: 2, 8: 1}. Exclude 4. Frequencies: {9: 3, 5: 2, 8: 1}. Most frequent is 9. Output is 5. Doesn't work.\n    *   Try tie-breaking: \"lowest color index\". Neighbors: 9, 5, 8. Lowest is 5. Output is 5. OK!\n    *   Test `input[0, 9]=4`. Neighbors: {9: 1, 5: 1}. Tie. Lowest color index is 5. Output is 8. Doesn't work.\n\n    *   Maybe the tie-breaker is positional? Prefer color above?\n    *   `input[8, 8]=4`. Neighbor above is `input[7, 8]=4` (bg).\n    *   `input[0, 9]=4`. Neighbor above doesn't exist.\n\n    *   **Let's focus on the structure:** The output seems to be formed by vertical bands in the right half.\n        `train_1`: Col 5-7 are 9. Col 8 is 5. Col 9 is 8/5.\n        `train_2`: Col 5 mostly 2. Col 6-7 are 2. Col 8 is 5. Col 9 is 8/5.\n    *   Could the rule be simpler? For each column `j` in the right half:\n        1. Find most frequent color `C_right_bg` for the whole right half.\n        2. Find the most frequent *non-bg* color `C_col` in input column `j`.\n        3. Fill output column `j` with `C_col`?\n        *   `train_1`: `C_right_bg=4`.\n            *   Col 5: Non-bg `9,9,9,5,5`. Freq: {9:3, 5:2}. Most freq non-bg = 9. Output Col 5 = 9.

Doesn't fit simple fill.\n\n    *   The simple column fill based on most frequent non-background color (with some tie-breaker) almost works but fails on ties and column 9. Column 9 seems special.\n\n    *   **Revised Right Half Hypothesis:**\n        1. Find `C_right_bg` (most frequent color in input right half).\n        2. For each column `j` (5 to 8):\n           a. Find frequencies of non-`C_right_bg` colors in input column `j`.\n           b. If no non-`C_right_bg` colors, maybe fill with `C_right_bg`? (Check examples - doesn't seem to happen here).\n           c. Determine the dominant color `C_dom` for the column: the non-`C_right_bg` color with the highest frequency.\n           d. Break ties: If counts are equal, choose the color with the *lowest numerical value*.\n           e. Fill output column `j` entirely with `C_dom`.\n        3. For the last column (column 9):\n           a. Find the highest non-`C_right_bg` pixel: `input[r_top, 9] = C_top`.\n           b. Find the lowest non-`C_right_bg` pixel: `input[r_bot, 9] = C_bot`.\n           c. Fill output column 9 from row 0 to `r_top` with `C_top`.\n           d. Fill output column 9 from row `r_top + 1` to end with `C_bot`.
