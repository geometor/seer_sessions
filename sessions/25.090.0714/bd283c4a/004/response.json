Fails.\n\n        *   This \"topmost non-bg pixel\" rule also fails.\n\n        *   **Let's reconsider the specific failures:**\n            *   Ex1, Col 7: Expected 5. Input Col 7 non-bg: `(5,1), (9,2), (9,6), (9,7), (5,8), (9,9)`. Why 5?\n            *   Ex2, Col 5: Expected mostly 2. Input Col 5 non-bg: `(5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (2,7), (8,8), (8,9)`. Why 2?\n            *   Ex2, Col 7: Expected 2. Input Col 7 non-bg: `(5,2), (5,3), (8,5), (5,8), (5,9)`. Why 2?\n            *   Ex2, Col 8: Expected 5. Input Col 8 non-bg: `(2,1), (2,2), (2,7), (2,8), (5,9)`. Why 5?\n\n        *   **Key Insight from Ex2 Output Col 5:** `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 6`. The 6 at the bottom `output[9, 5]` corresponds to `input[9, 5]=8`. And `input[8, 5]=8`. The top non-bg is 5. Most freq is 5. This column is strange. What if `C_right_bg` was 5 instead of 6?\n            *   Recalculate `C_right_bg` for Ex2: Freqs {6: 25, 2: 12, 5: 8, 8: 5}. Most frequent is 6. It's correct.\n            *   What if the *single* non-bg pixel at `input[9,5]` is treated specially? It's an 8. The output is 6. Where does 6 come from? It's the background color! Maybe if a column has a non-bg pixel only at the very bottom? No, `input[8,5]` is also 8. `input[7,5]` is 2.\n            *   Look at Input Col 5 again: `5 5 5 5 6 6 6 2 8 8`. Output: `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 6`. The only '2' is at `input[7, 5]`. The only '6' (bg) is at `input[4,5], input[5,5], input[6,5]`.\n            *   This looks like some kind of vertical propagation or signal.\n\n        *   **Vertical Propagation Idea:** For each column `j` in the right half:\n            1.  Find `C_right_bg`.\n            2.  Scan the input column `j` from top to bottom.\n            3.  Keep track of the 'current signal color'. Initialize it (e.g., to `C_right_bg` or null).\n            4.  If `input[r, j]` is `C_right_bg`, the `output[r, j]` takes the 'current signal color'.\n            5.  If `input[r, j]` is *not* `C_right_bg`, it potentially *updates* the 'current signal color' for subsequent rows *and* sets `output[r, j]` to this new color. How is the signal updated? Maybe the first non-bg color becomes the signal?\n\n            *   Let's try this on Ex2, Col 5 (`bg=6`):\n                *   r=0: input=5 (non-bg). Signal becomes 5. output[0, 5] = 5.\n                *   r=1: input=5 (non-bg). Signal stays 5. output[1, 5] = 5.\n                *   r=2: input=5 (non-bg). Signal stays 5. output[2, 5] = 5.\n                *   r=3: input=5 (non-bg). Signal stays 5. output[3, 5] = 5.\n                *   r=4: input=6 (bg). output[4, 5] takes signal = 5.\n                *   r=5: input=6 (bg). output[5, 5] takes signal = 5.\n                *   r=6: input=6 (bg). output[6, 5] takes signal = 5.\n                *   r=7: input=2 (non-bg). Signal *changes* to 2? output[7, 5] = 2.\n                *   r=8: input=8 (non-bg). Signal *changes* to 8? output[8, 5] = 8.\n                *   r=9: input=8 (non-bg). Signal stays 8? output[9, 5] = 8.\n                *   Result: `5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 8 8`. Doesn't match `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 6`.\n\n            *   What if the signal only propagates *downwards* from the *first* non-background color encountered?\n            *   Ex2, Col 5 (`bg=6`): First non-bg is 5 at r=0. Signal is 5.\n                *   output[0,5]=5. output[1,5]=5. ... output[6,5]=5.\n                *   At r=7, input=2 (non-bg). Output is 2. Does signal change?\n                *   At r=8, input=8 (non-bg). Output is 8. Does signal change?\n                *   Still doesn't match.\n\n            *   Maybe the color used to fill is the *last* non-background color seen *above* the current cell?\n            *   Ex2, Col 5 (`bg=6`):\n                *   r=0: input=5. Output=5. Last non-bg above = None.\n                *   r=1: input=5. Output=5. Last non-bg above = 5.\n                *   ...\n                *   r=4: input=6 (bg).

Highest numerical value? Topmost? Lowest?\n            *   Test: **Tie-break = Lowest value**\n                *   Ex1, Col 5: {9:3, 5:3}. Tie. Lowest=5. Output Col 5 = 5. **FAILS** (Expected 9).\n                *   Ex1, Col 7: {5:2, 9:4}. Max freq=9. Output Col 7 = 9. **FAILS** (Expected 5).\n            *   Test: **Tie-break = Highest value**\n                *   Ex1, Col 5: {9:3, 5:3}. Tie. Highest=9. Output Col 5 = 9.

Output Col 7 = 9. **FAILS** (Expected 5).\n            *   Test: **Tie-break = Lowest occurrence**\n                *   Ex1, Col 5: 9@r=3, 5@r=7. Tie. Lowest=5. Output Col 5 = 5. **FAILS** (Expected 9).\n\n        *   No simple frequency/tie-break rule seems to work for cols `mid` to `width-2`.\n\n    *   **Hypothesis Refinement - Last Column (`width-1`):**\n        *   Expected Output Ex1 Col 9: `8 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5`\n        *   Input Col 9 (`bg=4`): `4 4 4 4 4 4 4 9 8 4`. Non-bg: `(9, 7), (8, 8)`.\n        *   Topmost non-bg: 9 at r=7. Bottommost non-bg: 8 at r=8.\n        *   Previous rule: Fill 0-7 with 9, 8-9 with 8. -> `9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 8 8`. Fails.\n        *   Expected Output Ex2 Col 9: `8 8 8 8 8 8 5 5 5 5`\n        *   Input Col 9 (`bg=6`): `6 6 2 2 2 8 8 6 6 6`. Non-bg: `(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (8,5), (8,6)`.\n        *   Topmost non-bg: 2 at r=2. Bottommost non-bg: 8 at r=6.\n        *   Previous rule: Fill 0-2 with 2, 3-9 with 8. -> `2 2 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`. Fails.\n\n        *   **New Last Column Idea:** Look at the colors in the output last column. They seem to be drawn from the non-bg colors present in the input last column, but the split point and fill colors are different.\n        *   Ex1: Output is 8 then 5. Input has 9 and 8. Where does 5 come from? 5 is the dominant color of the *previous* output column (Col 8).\n        *   Ex2: Output is 8 then 5. Input has 2 and 8. Where does 5 come from? 5 is the dominant color of the *previous* output column (Col 8).\n\n        *   **Revised Last Column Rule:**\n            1. Find the color `C_prev` used to fill the *output* column `width-2`.\n            2. Find the topmost non-`C_right_bg` pixel `(C_top, r_top)` in the *input* column `width-1`.\n            3. Fill the *output* column `width-1` from row 0 to `r_top` (inclusive) with `C_top`.\n            4. Fill the *output* column `width-1` from row `r_top + 1` to the end with `C_prev`.\n            5. Handle edge case: If no non-`C_right_bg` pixel exists in input column `width-1`, fill output column `width-1` entirely with `C_prev`.\n\n        *   Let's test this:\n            *   Ex1: `C_right_bg=4`. Output Col 8 was filled with 5 (based on expected output). `C_prev=5`. Input Col 9 non-bg: `(9, 7), (8, 8)`. Topmost is 9 at r=7. `C_top=9`, `r_top=7`. Fill output 0-7 with 9. Fill output 8-9 with 5. Result: `9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 5 5`. **FAILS** (Expected `8 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5`).\n\n            *   Ex2: `C_right_bg=6`. Output Col 8 was filled with 5 (based on expected output). `C_prev=5`. Input Col 9 non-bg: `(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (8,5), (8,6)`. Topmost is 2 at r=2. `C_top=2`, `r_top=2`. Fill output 0-2 with 2. Fill output 3-9 with 5. Result: `2 2 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5`. **FAILS** (Expected `8 8 8 8 8 8 5 5 5 5`).\n\n    *   **Total Rethink on Right Half:** The column independence might be wrong. Maybe there's an interaction? Or perhaps the \"background\" definition is subtler.\n    *   What if the \"background\" is simply the most frequent color in the *entire input grid*?\n        *   Ex1: Counts needed.\n        *   Ex2: Counts needed.\n"

Needs a base case. Maybe it uses frequency?\n\n            *   Let's try:\n                *   Base case: Output Col `mid` = Most frequent non-bg color in Input Col `mid`. (Tie-break: Lowest value?).\n                *   For `j` from `mid+1` to `width-2`:\n                    *   Count non-bg colors `N` in Input Col `j`.\n                    *   If `N=0`, Output Col `j` = `C_right_bg`.\n                    *   If `N=1` (color `C`), Output Col `j` = `C`.\n                    *   If `N>1`, Output Col `j` = Output Col `j-1`.\n\n            *   Test on Ex1 (`bg=4`, `mid=5`):\n                *   Col 5: Non-bg {9:3, 5:3}. Tie. Lowest=5. Output Col 5 = 5. **FAILS** (Expected 9). Let's try tie-break = highest value. Tie-break=9. Output Col 5 = 9. OK.\n                *   Col 6: Non-bg {9:2}. N=1. Color=9.

Expected Output Ex2 Col 9: `8 8 8 8 8 8 5 5 ...`. The colors are 8 and 5. In both cases, 5 is the fill color from the previous column (Col 8). Where does the 8 come from?\n        *   Ex1 Input Col 9 non-bg: `(9,7), (8,8)`.\n        *   Ex2 Input Col 9 non-bg: `(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (8,5), (8,6)`.\n        *   In both cases, 8 is present in the input column. Is it the *lowest* non-background color?\n            *   Ex1: Lowest non-bg is 8 at r=8. `r_low=8`, `C_low=8`.\n            *   Ex2: Lowest non-bg is 8 at r=6. `r_low=6`, `C_low=8`.\n        *   **Revised Last Column Rule 2:**\n            1. Find color `C_prev` used to fill *output* column `width-2`.\n            2. Find the *lowest* non-`C_right_bg` pixel `(C_low, r_low)` in the *input* column `width-1`.\n            3. Fill *output* column `width-1` from row 0 to `r_low` (inclusive) with `C_low`.\n            4. Fill *output* column `width-1` from row `r_low + 1` to end with `C_prev`.\n            5. Handle edge case: If no non-`C_right_bg` pixel, fill with `C_prev`.\n\n        *   Test this:\n            *   Ex1: `C_prev=5`. Lowest non-bg is `(8, 8)`. `C_low=8`, `r_low=8`. Fill 0-8 with 8. Fill 9 with 5. Result: `8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 5`. **FAILS** (Expected `8 8 5 5...`).\n\n    *   Okay, the interaction seems complex. Let's assume the left half rule is correct. Let's focus purely on the right half mapping.\n    *   Input Right 1 -> Output Right 1\n    *   Input Right 2 -> Output Right 2\n\n    *   Maybe look at unique colors per column?\n        *   Ex1 Input Right:\n            *   Col 5: {9, 4, 5} -> Output 9\n            *   Col 6: {4, 9} -> Output 9\n            *   Col 7: {4, 5, 9} -> Output 5\n            *   Col 8: {9, 5, 4} -> Output 5\n            *   Col 9: {4, 9, 8} -> Output 8/5 split\n        *   Ex2 Input Right:\n            *   Col 5: {5, 6, 2, 8} -> Output 2/6 split\n            *   Col 6: {6, 2} -> Output 2\n            *   Col 7: {6, 5, 8} -> Output 2\n            *   Col 8: {6, 2, 5} -> Output 5\n            *   Col 9: {6, 2, 8} -> Output 8/5 split\n\n    *   This isn't revealing a simple pattern either.\n\n    *   What if the fill color for cols `mid` to `width-2` is the *least* frequent non-background color in the column? (Tie break: highest value?)\n        *   Ex1 (`bg=4`):\n            *   Col 5: {9:3, 5:3}. Tie. Highest=9. Output=9. OK.\n            *   Col 6: {9:2}. Only one non-bg. Output=9. OK.\n            *   Col 7: {5:2, 9:4}. Least freq=5. Output=5. OK.\n            *   Col 8: {9:2, 5:4}. Least freq=9. Output=5. NO.\n        *   Ex2 (`bg=6`):\n            *   Col 5: {5:4, 2:1, 8:2}. Least freq=2. Output=2/6. Close?\n            *   Col 6: {2:5}. Only one non-bg. Output=2. OK.\n            *   Col 7: {5:4, 8:1}. Least freq=8. Output=2. NO.\n            *   Col 8: {2:4, 5:1}. Least freq=5. Output=5. OK.\n\n    *   This \"least frequent\" idea works for more columns but still fails. The Ex2 Col 5 output having a '6' (background) is also really confusing.\n\n    *   Let's revisit the last column split. Output always seems to split into `C1` then `C2`.\n        *   Ex1: `8` then `5`. Input Col 9 non-bg: `(9,7), (8,8)`. `C_prev=5`.\n        *   Ex2: `8` then `5`. Input Col 9 non-bg: `(2,2)...(8,6)`. `C_prev=5`.\n        *   It seems `C2` is always `C_prev` (the fill color of output col `width-2`).\n        *   `C1` seems to be related to the non-bg colors in the input column. In both cases, `C1=8`. 8 is present in both input columns. Is it the *lowest* non-bg color in the input column? Yes.\n        *   The split point `r_split`? Output rows 0 to `r_split` are `C1`, rows `r_split+1` to end are `C2`.\n            *   Ex1: `r_split=1`. Expected: `8 8 5...`. Lowest non-bg `(8, 8)`. `r_low=8`.\n            *   Ex2: `r_split=5`. Expected: `8 8 8 8 8 8 5...`. Lowest non-bg `(8, 6)`. `r_low=6`.\n        *   Rule attempt: `C1` = color of lowest non-bg pixel in input col `width-1`. `C2` = `C_prev`. `r_split` = row index of lowest non-bg pixel in input col `width-1`. Fill 0..`r_split` with `C1`, rest with `C2`.\n            *   Ex1: `C1=8`, `C2=5`, `r_split=8`. Output: `8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 5`. Still fails.\n\n        *   What if `C1` is the *highest* non-bg color in input col `width-1`?\n            *   Ex1: Highest non-bg is `(9, 7)`. `C1=9`. Fails.\n        *   What if `C1` is the *numerically lowest* non-bg color?\n            *   Ex1: Non-bg 9, 8. Lowest is 8. `C1=8`.\n            *   Ex2: Non-bg 2, 8. Lowest is 2. `C1=2`. Fails (Expected 8).\n        *   What if `C1` is the *numerically highest* non-bg color?\n            *   Ex1: Non-bg 9, 8. Highest is 9. `C1=9`. Fails.\n            *   Ex2: Non-bg 2, 8. Highest is 8. `C1=8`. OK.\n        *   Rule attempt: `C1` = numerically highest non-bg color in input col `width-1`. `C2` = `C_prev`. `r_split` = row index of *lowest* non-bg pixel?\n            *   Ex1: `C1=9`, `C2=5`, `r_split=8`. Output: `9...9 (0-8), 5 (9)`. Fails.\n            *   Ex2: `C1=8`, `C2=5`, `r_split=6`. Output: `8...8 (0-6), 5...5 (7-9)`. OK.\n\n    *   This is inconsistent. The rules seem specific and arbitrary. Let's pause and rethink the overall goal. The process seems to be simplifying or cleaning the right half, column by column, potentially with influence from left-to-right. The last column seems to combine local information with info from the column to its left.\n\n    *   **Final Attempt Strategy:**\n        1.  Left Half: Fill with most frequent color (lowest value tie-break). (Seems solid).\n        2.  Right Half Background (`C_right_bg`): Most frequent color in input right half (lowest value tie-break). (Seems solid).\n        3.  Right Half Columns `mid` to `width-2`: Fill with the *least frequent* non-`C_right_bg` color present in the *input column*.\n            *   Tie-breaking for least frequent: Choose the color with the *highest* numerical value.\n            *   If only one non-`C_right_bg` color exists, use that color.\n            *   If zero non-`C_right_bg` colors exist, fill with `C_right_bg`.\n        4.  Right Half Last Column (`width-1`):\n            *   Determine `C_prev` (fill color of output column `width-2`).\n            *   Find all non-`C_right_bg` pixels `(c, r)` in input column `width-1`.\n            *   If none exist, fill with `C_prev`.\n            *   Otherwise:\n                *   Find `C1` = the *numerically highest* color value among the non-`C_right_bg` pixels.\n                *   Find `r_low` = the *maximum row index* among all non-`C_right_bg` pixels.\n                *   `C2` = `C_prev`.\n                *   Fill output rows 0 to `r_low` (inclusive) with `C1`.\n                *   Fill output rows `r_low + 1` to end with `C2`.\n\n    *   **Validate this strategy mentally:**\n        *   Ex1 (`bg=4`):\n            *   Left: OK (4).\n            *   Col 5: {9:3, 5:3}. Least freq tie. Highest value=9. Output=9. OK.\n            *   Col 6: {9:2}. Least freq=9. Output=9. OK.\n            *   Col 7: {5:2, 9:4}. Least freq=5. Output=5. OK.\n            *   Col 8: {9:2, 5:4}. Least freq=9. Output=9. **FAILS** (Expected 5). -> This strategy fails.\n\n    *   Let's revert the rule for cols mid to width-2 to \"Most Frequent\" and try the new Last Column rule.\n    *   **Strategy vNext:**\n        1.  Left Half: Fill with most frequent color (lowest value tie-break).\n        2.  Right Half Background (`C_right_bg`): Most frequent color in input right half (lowest value tie-break).\n        3.  Right Half Columns `mid` to `width-2`: Fill with the *most frequent* non-`C_right_bg` color present in the *input column*.\n            *   Tie-breaking for most frequent: Choose the color that appears *lowest* (max row index). If still tied, choose *lowest* numerical value. (This worked previously for Ex1 cols 5,6,8 but failed col 7 - expected 5, calculated 9). Let's recheck that tie break...\n            *   Ex1, Col 7: Non-bg `(5,1), (9,2), (9,6), (9,7), (5,8), (9,9)`. Freq: {5:2, 9:4}. Most freq=9. Output=9. Fails (Expected 5).\n            *   Ex1, Col 8: Non-bg `(9,0), (5,1), (9,3), (5,4), (5,6), (5,8)`. Freq: {9:2, 5:4}. Most freq=5. Output=5. OK.\n            *   Let's retry the tie break used in the code: \"lowest instance appears lower (larger row index)\".\n                *   Ex1, Col 5: {9:3, 5:3}. Tie. Max row 9 is 3. Max row 5 is 7. 5 wins. Output=5. **FAILS** (Expected 9).\n            *   The \"most frequent\" rule seems problematic due to tie-breaks or fundamental flaws.\n\n    *   What if the fill color for columns `mid` to `width-2` is based on the *colors present*, not frequency?\n        *   If only one non-bg color C -> fill C\n        *   If multiple non-bg colors -> ??? Maybe fill with the *lowest numerical value* non-bg color present?\n            *   Ex1:\n                *   Col 5: non-bg 9, 5. Lowest=5. **FAILS** (Exp 9).\n                *   Col 6: non-bg 9. Lowest=9. OK.\n                *   Col 7: non-bg 5, 9. Lowest=5. OK.\n                *   Col 8: non-bg 9, 5. Lowest=5. OK.\n            *   Ex2:\n                *   Col 5: non-bg 5, 2, 8. Lowest=2. Output=2/6. OK-ish.\n                *   Col 6: non-bg 2. Lowest=2. OK.\n                *   Col 7: non-bg 5, 8. Lowest=5. **FAILS** (Exp 2).\n                *   Col 8: non-bg 2, 5. Lowest=2. **FAILS** (Exp 5).\n\n    *   This is tough. Let's stick with the \"most frequent\" rule for `mid` to `width-2` and accept it might be wrong, but try the proposed last column rule again.\n    *   **Final Final Strategy:**\n        1. Left Half: Fill with most frequent color (lowest value tie-break).\n        2. Right Half Background (`C_right_bg`): Most frequent color in input right half (lowest value tie-break).\n        3. Right Half Columns `mid` to `width-2`: Fill with the *most frequent* non-`C_right_bg` color present in the *input column*. Tie-break: Color whose *lowest* instance (max row index) is *lowest* (max row index wins). Final tie-break: *Lowest* numerical value. (This matches the failed code attempt's logic).\n        4. Right Half Last Column (`width-1`):\n            *   Determine `C_prev` (fill color of output column `width-2` *based on step 3's calculation*).\n            *   Find all non-`C_right_bg` pixels `(c, r)` in input column `width-1`.\n            *   If none exist, fill with `C_prev`.\n            *   Otherwise:\n                *   Find `C1` = the *numerically highest* color value among the non-`C_right_bg` pixels.\n                *   Find `r_low` = the *maximum row index* among all non-`C_right_bg` pixels.\n                *   `C2` = `C_prev`.\n                *   Fill output rows 0 to `r_low` (inclusive) with `C1`.\n                *   Fill output rows `r_low + 1` to end with `C2`.\n\n    *   This seems like the most plausible combination tested so far, acknowledging step 3 might be imperfect.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the division of the grid and the rule for the left half. However, the logic for the right half failed significantly. The errors indicate that the column processing rules (frequency analysis, tie-breaking, last-column special handling) were incorrect. The transformation in the right half appears to be a column-based simplification or propagation, but the exact mechanism is proving difficult to pin down, especially regarding tie-breaking and the interaction for the final column. The strategy is to refine the column-processing rules for the right half based on the observed errors and expected outputs.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's recalculate the key values for the right half based on the final proposed strategy's logic for columns `mid` to `width-2` (most frequent non-bg, tie-break: lowest position -> lowest value).\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid: 10x10. `mid=5`.\n*   Input Left Half (0-4): Most frequent = 4 (Yellow). Output Left Half = All 4s.\n*   Input Right Half (5-9): Most frequent (`C_right_bg`) = 4 (Yellow).\n*   Input Col 5: Non-bg `(9,0), (5,1), (9,2), (9,3), (5,6), (5,7)`. Freq {9:3, 5:3}. Tie. Max row 9=3, Max row 5=7. 5 wins tie-break 1. `C_dom=5`.\n*   Input Col 6: Non-bg `(9,2), (9,6)`. Freq {9:2}. `C_dom=9`.\n*   Input Col 7: Non-bg `(5,1), (9,2), (9,6), (9,7), (5,8), (9,9)`. Freq {5:2, 9:4}. `C_dom=9`.\n*   Input Col 8: Non-bg `(9,0), (5,1), (9,3), (5,4), (5,6), (5,8)`. Freq {9:2, 5:4}. `C_dom=5`.\n*   Output Cols 5-8 (calculated): 5, 9, 9, 5.\n*   `C_prev` (for Col 9 calc) = 5.\n*   Input Col 9: Non-bg `(9,7), (8,8)`. Numerically highest non-bg `C1=9`. Lowest position `r_low=8`. `C2=C_prev=5`. Output Col 9: Rows 0-8 = 9, Row 9 = 5.\n*   Predicted Output Right Half:\n    "

Identify `C_right_bg`.\n        2. Create output right half.\n        3. Iterate columns `j` from `mid` to `width-1`.\n        4. `current_color = C_right_bg`.\n        5. For each column `j`: Iterate rows `r` from 0 to `height-1`.\n        6. If `input[r, j]` is NOT `C_right_bg`, update `current_color = input[r, j]`.\n        7. Set `output[r, j] = current_color`.\n\n    *   Test Top Propagation on Ex1 Right Half (`bg=4`):\n        *   Col 5: Input `9 4 9 9 4 4 5 5 4 4`.\n            *   r=0: input=9. current=9. output[0]=9.\n            *   r=1: input=4(bg). current=9. output[1]=9.\n            *   r=2: input=9. current=9. output[2]=9.\n            *   r=3: input=9. current=9. output[3]=9.\n            *   r=4: input=4(bg). current=9. output[4]=9.\n            *   r=5: input=4(bg). current=9. output[5]=9.\n            *   r=6: input=5. current=5. output[6]=5.\n            *   r=7: input=5. current=5. output[7]=5.\n            *   r=8: input=4(bg). current=5. output[8]=5.\n            *   r=9: input=4(bg). current=5. output[9]=5.\n            *   Result Col 5: `9 9 9 9 9 9 5 5 5 5`. **FAILS** (Expected 9).\n\n    *   Okay, the logic seems tied to the specific examples. Let's look ONLY at Example 1 right half transformation.\n        *   Input Cols 5,6 -> Output Cols 5,6 (All 9s)\n        *   Input Cols 7,8 -> Output Cols 7,8 (All 5s)\n        *   Input Col 9 -> Output Col 9 (Split 8/5)\n        *   Why 9 for 5"
