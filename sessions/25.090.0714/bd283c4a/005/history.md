    *   The most frequent color in the right half is yellow (4). The most frequent in the left half is also yellow (4).
    *   This doesn't directly explain the output. The left half *becomes* uniformly yellow (4), which matches the most frequent color there. But the right half *doesn't* become uniformly yellow (4).

    *   **Alternative idea:** Maybe the transformation identifies "noise" pixels and replaces them? What defines noise?
    *   Let's consider the left half (columns 0-4). The output is all yellow (4). Is yellow (4) special in the input's left half? It's the most frequent color. Perhaps the rule for the left half is: "Find the most frequent color in columns 0-4 and fill columns 0-4 of the output with that color."

    *   Now consider the right half (columns 5-9). The output retains maroon (9), gray (5), and azure (8). Yellow (4) is removed. Is yellow (4) noise in the right half? It *is* the most frequent color there. This is counter-intuitive.
    *   What if the rule is about stability or neighbours?
    *   Look at the single Azure (8) pixel at input[8, 9]. Its neighbors (in the full grid) are:
        
```
        4 5 4
        4 4 8  <- The 8 itself
        9 5 4
        ```

        Neighbors: 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 9, 5, 4. Count: {4: 6, 5: 2, 9: 1}. Yellow (4) is dominant.
        In the output, this pixel is still 8, and the one above it also becomes 8.
        Output[8, 9] = 5. Output[7, 9] = 5. Ah, wait, the output I transcribed above is wrong. Let me get it from the prompt again.
        Output:
        
```
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 8
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 8
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 5  <- Output[8, 9] is 5 (gray)
        4 4 4 4 4 9 9 9 5 5  <- Output[9, 9] is 5 (gray)
        ```

        The Azure (8) pixels are at Output[0, 9] and Output[1, 9]. Where did they come from? The *input* has an Azure (8) at Input[8, 9]. This doesn't seem connected.
        Let me re-examine the input grid. There's an Azure (8) at Input[0, 2] and Input[8, 9].
        
```
        Input:
        4 4 8 9 4 | 9 4 4 9 4
        4 9 4 4 5 | 4 4 9 5 4
        5 9 9 4 5 | 9 4 5 9 4
        5 9 4 4 5 | 9 4 9 4 4
        5 9 4 9 4 | 4 4 5 4 4
        5 9 4 9 4 | 4 9 4 5 4
        5 9 4 5 4 | 5 5 9 4 4
        5 9 4 9 4 | 5 9 9 4 9
        5 9 4 9 4 | 4 9 5 4 8  <- Azure here
        4 9 4 4 9 | 4 9 5 4 4
        ```

        Output:
        
```
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 8  <- Azure here
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 8  <- Azure here
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 5
        4 4 4 4 4 | 9 9 9 5 5
        ```

        This is confusing. The Azure location seems to shift completely.
        What if the transformation isn't pixel-wise based on neighbors, but column-wise or region-wise?

    *   **Revisit `train_2`:** Let's see if the second example clarifies things.
        Input `train_2`:
        
```
        2 6 6 6 6 | 5 6 6 6 6
        2 6 2 6 6 | 5 2 6 2 6

        6 2 6 6 2 | 8 6 5 6 6
        ```

        Output `train_2`:
        
```
        6 6 6 6 6 | 2 2 2 5 8

        6 6 6 6 6 | 6 2 2 5 5 <- Note the 6 here
        ```

    *   Again, the grid is 10x10. It seems split into columns 0-4 and 5-9.
    *   Left half (cols 0-4) becomes uniformly magenta (6). Let's find the most frequent color in the input's left half.

        *   The most frequent color in the input's left half is magenta (6), which matches the output's left half. This supports the hypothesis: **Rule for Left Half: Fill with the most frequent color found in the input's left half.**

    *   Now, the right half (cols 5-9) of `train_2`.
        Input: Mixed colors (5, 6, 2, 8). Most frequent is 6 (magenta).
        Output: Mostly red (2), gray (5), azure (8), with one magenta (6) at the bottom left corner of this half (output[9, 5]).
        *   This output does *not* seem related to the most frequent color (6) in the input's right half.
        *   The output again looks "smoothed" or "simplified".
        *   The colors present in the output's right half (2, 5, 8, 6) are all present in the input's right half.
        *   Is it possible the rule involves identifying certain "stable" or "significant" pixels/regions in the input's right half and propagating them?

    *   Let's re-examine the structure of the output right half for `train_2`:
        
```
        2 2 2 5 8
        2 2 2 5 8
        2 2 2 5 8
        2 2 2 5 8
        2 2 2 5 8
        2 2 2 5 8
        2 2 2 5 5
        2 2 2 5 5
        2 2 2 5 5
        6 2 2 5 5
        ```

        It's composed of vertical columns of solid color, except for the bottom part of the last two columns and the single '6' pixel.
        *   Col 5: Mostly 2, one 6 at the bottom.
        *   Col 6: All 2.
        *   Col 7: All 2.
        *   Col 8: Mostly 5.
        *   Col 9: Mostly 8, then 5.

    *   Compare output columns 5-9 to input columns 5-9.
        *   Input Col 5: `5 5 5 5 6 6 6 2 8 8` -> Output Col 5: `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 6` (Mostly 2)
        *   Input Col 6: `6 2 2 6 6 2 2 6 6 6` -> Output Col 6: `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2` (All 2)
        *   Input Col 7: `6 6 5 5 6 8 6 6 5 5` -> Output Col 7: `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2` (All 2)
        *   Input Col 8: `6 2 2 6 6 6 6 2 2 5` -> Output Col 8: `5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5` (All 5)
        *   Input Col 9: `6 6 2 2 2 8 8 6 6 6` -> Output Col 9: `8 8 8 8 8 8 5 5 5 5` (Mostly 8, then 5)

    *   Is there a "dominant" color per column in the input's right half that determines the output column?
        *   Input Col 5: Counts: {5: 4, 6: 3, 8: 2, 2: 1}. Most frequent: 5. Output: Mostly 2. Doesn't fit.
        *   Input Col 6: Counts: {6: 6, 2: 4}. Most frequent: 6. Output: All 2. Doesn't fit.
        *   Input Col 7: Counts: {6: 5, 5: 4, 8: 1}. Most frequent: 6. Output: All 2. Doesn't fit.
        *   Input Col 8: Counts: {6: 5, 2: 4, 5: 1}. Most frequent: 6. Output: All 5. Doesn't fit.
        *   Input Col 9: Counts: {6: 5, 2: 3, 8: 2}. Most frequent: 6. Output: Mostly 8, then 5. Doesn't fit.

    *   **New Hypothesis:** Maybe the task involves identifying "objects" and their properties. What are the objects? Contiguous blocks of non-background color?
    *   In `train_1`, yellow (4) seems like a background or default color.
    *   In `train_2`, magenta (6) seems like a background or default color.
    *   In both cases, the left half of the output grid is filled with the most frequent color from the input's left half. Let's call this the "background color" for the left side.

    *   What about the right side?
    *   In `train_1`, the right side input has colors 4, 9, 5, 8. Yellow (4) is the most frequent. The output has 9, 5, 8. Yellow (4) is removed.
    *   In `train_2`, the right side input has colors 5, 6, 2, 8. Magenta (6) is the most frequent. The output has 2, 5, 8, 6.
    *   It seems the rule for the right half might be:
        1. Identify the most frequent color in the input's *right* half. Let's call this `right_bg`.
        2. Create a temporary grid containing only the *non* `right_bg` colors from the input's right half, preserving their positions. Other cells are empty/marked.
        3. Process this temporary grid to generate the output's right half. How?
            *   Maybe fill empty cells based on neighbors?
            *   Maybe find the largest remaining objects and fill columns/regions based on them?

    *   Let's try this on `train_1`:
        1. Input right half (cols 5-9): `4 4 8 9 4 9 4 4 9 4`, `4 9 4 4 5 4 4 5 9 4`, ... Most frequent is 4 (yellow). `right_bg = 4`.
        2. Temporary grid (replace 4 with 0 - white/empty):
           
```
           9 0 0 9 0
           0 0 9 5 0
           9 9 0 9 0
           9 0 0 9 0
           0 0 0 5 0
           0 9 0 5 0
           5 5 9 0 0
           5 9 9 0 9
           0 0 5 0 8
           0 9 9 5 0
           ```

        3. Process this grid to get the output right half:
           
```
           9 9 9 5 8
           9 9 9 5 8
           9 9 9 5 5
           9 9 9 5 5
           9 9 9 5 5
           9 9 9 5 5
           9 9 9 5 5
           9 9 9 5 5
           9 9 9 5 5
           9 9 9 5 5
           ```

           How does the temporary grid transform into this?
           *   Column 0 of temp has 9s and 5s. Output col 0 is all 9s.
           *   Column 1 of temp has 9s and 5s. Output col 1 is all 9s.
           *   Column 2 of temp has 9s and 5s. Output col 2 is all 9s.
           *   Column 3 of temp has 9s and 5s. Output col 3 is all 5s.
           *   Column 4 of temp has 9 and 8. Output col 4 is two 8s then all 5s.
           This looks like: For each column in the temporary grid, find the *most frequent non-zero color* in that column. Fill the output column with that color. If there's a tie or no non-zero colors? Maybe use a default or look at neighbors? What about the Azure (8)? It's unique in its column (col 4).
           Let's re-check counts per column in the temp grid:
           *   Col 0: {9: 4, 5: 3}. Most frequent: 9. -> Output: 9. Fits.
           *   Col 1: {9: 4, 5: 1}. Most frequent: 9. -> Output: 9. Fits.
           *   Col 2: {9: 4, 5: 1}. Most frequent: 9. -> Output: 9. Fits.
           *   Col 3: {9: 3, 5: 5}. Most frequent: 5. -> Output: 5. Fits.
           *   Col 4: {9: 2, 8: 1}. Most frequent: 9. -> Output: two 8s then 5s. Doesn't fit.

    *   **Refined Hypothesis for Right Half:**
        1. Determine the background color (`right_bg`) for the input's right half (most frequent color).
        2. Create the output's right half grid.
        3. Iterate through each *column* `j` (from 5 to 9) of the input grid.
        4. Find all non-`right_bg` colors present in that input column `j`.
        5. If there are *any* non-`right_bg` colors:
           a. Find the *highest* non-`right_bg` pixel in that column `j`. Let its color be `C_top`.
           b. Find the *lowest* non-`right_bg` pixel in that column `j`. Let its color be `C_bot`.
           c. Fill the output column corresponding to `j` (from row 0 down to the row of `C_top`) with color `C_top`.
           d. Fill the rest of the output column (from row `C_top` + 1 to the bottom) with color `C_bot`.
        6. If a column `j` in the input's right half contains *only* the `right_bg` color, what happens? (Need to check examples).

    *   Let's test this refined hypothesis on `train_1` right half:
        *   `right_bg = 4` (yellow).
        *   Input Col 5 (index 5): `9 4 9 9 4 4 5 5 4 4`. Non-bg: 9, 9, 9, 5, 5. Highest is 9 (row 0). Lowest is 5 (row 7). `C_top = 9`, `C_bot = 5`. Output col 5: Row 0 is 9. Rows 1-9 are 5. --> `9 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5`. **Doesn't match output** (`9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9`).

    *   **Let's rethink the right half processing.** Maybe it's about objects, not just columns.
    *   Consider `train_1` again. Output right half:
        
```
        9 9 9 5 8
        9 9 9 5 8
        9 9 9 5 5
        ...
        ```

        It looks like blocks of color. Maroon (9) block, Gray (5) block, Azure (8) pixels.
    *   Where could these come from? In the input's right half, ignore the background yellow (4).
        
```

        Maybe find the largest contiguous object of each non-background color?
        *   Maroon (9): Several disconnected blobs. Largest seems to be the one around (2,0), (3,0), (2,1), etc.
        *   Gray (5): Several blobs. Largest around (6,0), (6,1), (7,0), (8,2), (9,3).
        *   Azure (8): Single pixel at (8,4).

    *   This isn't leading anywhere simple. Let's simplify.
    *   **Overall Pattern:** Divide input grid vertically at the middle column index (index 5 for a 10-col grid). Process left and right halves independently to produce the output halves.
    *   **Left Half Rule:** Find the most frequent color in the input's left half. Fill the output's left half entirely with this color.
    *   **Right Half Rule:** This is the tricky part.
        *   Observe `train_1` output right half: Columns 5, 6, 7 are all Maroon (9). Column 8 is all Gray (5). Column 9 is two Azure (8) then Gray (5).
        *   Observe `train_2` output right half: Column 5 is mostly Red (2) with one Magenta (6). Columns 6, 7 are Red (2). Column 8 is Gray (5). Column 9 is mostly Azure (8) then Gray (5).
        *   The output columns seem determined column-by-column based *somehow* on the input columns.
        *   Maybe it involves the *topmost* non-background color in each input column?
            *   `train_1` right half (`bg=4`):
                *   Col 5: Top non-bg is 9 (row 0). Output col 5 is all 9. OK.
                *   Col 6: Top non-bg is 9 (row 2). Output col 6 is all 9. OK.
                *   Col 7: Top non-bg is 5 (row 1). Output col 7 is all 9. NO.
                *   Col 8: Top non-bg is 9 (row 0). Output col 8 is all 5. NO.
                *   Col 9: Top non-bg is 8 (row 8). Output col 9 starts with 8. Maybe?
            *   `train_2` right half (`bg=6`):
                *   Col 5: Top non-bg is 5 (row 0). Output col 5 starts with 2. NO.
                *   Col 6: Top non-bg is 2 (row 1). Output col 6 is all 2. OK.
                *   Col 7: Top non-bg is 5 (row 2). Output col 7 is all 2. NO.
                *   Col 8: Top non-bg is 2 (row 1). Output col 8 is all 5. NO.
                *   Col 9: Top non-bg is 2 (row 2). Output col 9 starts with 8. NO.

    *   **Let's reconsider the "background" definition.** Maybe it's not the most frequent color?
    *   What if the rule is about "cleaning" the grid?
    *   Look at the transformation row by row? No obvious row patterns.
    *   Look at the transformation column by column? We tried that.
    *   Look at the whole grid?
    *   **Hypothesis 3:**
        1.  Divide the input grid vertically into two halves (left: cols 0-4, right: cols 5-9).
        2.  **Left Half Processing:** Find the most frequent color `C_left` in the input's left half. Fill the output's left half (cols 0-4) completely with `C_left`.
        3.  **Right Half Processing:**
            a.  Find the most frequent color `C_right_bg` in the input's right half.
            b.  Initialize the output's right half as a copy of the input's right half.
            c.  Iterate through the cells `(r, c)` where `c >= 5`. If the color at `input[r, c]` is `C_right_bg`, change the color at `output[r, c]` based on some rule (maybe neighbor-based fill?).
            d.  This seems like "removing" the background color and letting the other colors "fill in".

    *   Let's test step 3 on `train_1`: `C_right_bg = 4` (yellow).
        Input right half:
        
```
        9 4 4 9 4
        4 4 9 5 4
        9 9 4 9 4
        9 4 4 9 4
        4 4 4 5 4
        4 9 4 5 4
        5 5 9 4 4
        5 9 9 4 9
        4 4 5 4 8
        4 9 9 5 4
        ```

        Output right half:
        
```
        9 9 9 5 8
        9 9 9 5 8
        9 9 9 5 5
        9 9 9 5 5
        9 9 9 5 5
        9 9 9 5 5
        9 9 9 5 5
        9 9 9 5 5
        9 9 9 5 5
        9 9 9 5 5
        ```

        If we replace the yellow (4) pixels in the input right half, how do they get filled to produce the output?
        Consider input[0, 6] = 4. Its neighbors are 4, 9, 5 (input right half only). Output[0, 6] = 9.
        Consider input[0, 7] = 4. Its neighbors are 9, 4, 9 (input right half only). Output[0, 7] = 9.
        Consider input[1, 5] = 4. Its neighbors are 9, 4, 9 (input right half only). Output[1, 5] = 9.
        Consider input[8, 5] = 4. Its neighbors are 5, 9, 5 (input right half only). Output[8, 5] = 9.
        Consider input[8, 6] = 4. Its neighbors are 9, 4, 9 (input right half only). Output[8, 6] = 9.

        This looks like a "fill" operation. When a cell in the input right half has the background color (`C_right_bg`), its corresponding output cell takes the color of the *nearest non-background* cell in the input right half? Or maybe the most frequent non-background neighbor?

        Let's refine:
        3. **Right Half Processing:**
           a. Find the most frequent color `C_right_bg` in the input's right half (cols >= 5).
           b. Create the output right half grid.
           c. For each cell `(r, c)` with `c >= 5`:
              i. If `input[r, c]` is *not* equal to `C_right_bg`, then `output[r, c] = input[r, c]`.
              ii. If `input[r, c]` *is* equal to `C_right_bg`, find the color `C_fill` to use for `output[r, c]`. The rule for `C_fill` might be: look at the 8 neighbors of `(r, c)` in the *input* grid (within the right half). Find the most frequent *non* `C_right_bg` color among the neighbors. If there's a tie, maybe default to the color of the cell directly above? Or the top-most, left-most neighbor?

    *   Let's test the neighbor rule on `train_1`, `C_right_bg = 4`.
        *   `input[0, 6] = 4`. Neighbors in right half: `input[0, 5]=9`, `input[1, 5]=4`, `input[1, 6]=4`, `input[1, 7]=9`, `input[0, 7]=4`. Non-bg neighbors: 9, 9. Most frequent non-bg neighbor is 9. `output[0, 6] = 9`. Matches.
        *   `input[0, 7] = 4`. Neighbors in right half: `input[0, 6]=4`, `input[1, 6]=4`, `input[1, 7]=9`, `input[1, 8]=5`, `input[0, 8]=9`. Non-bg neighbors: 9, 5, 9. Most frequent non-bg neighbor is 9. `output[0, 7] = 9`. Matches.
        *   `input[1, 5] = 4`. Neighbors in right half: `input[0, 5]=9`, `input[0, 6]=4`, `input[1, 6]=4`, `input[2, 6]=4`, `input[2, 5]=9`. Non-bg neighbors: 9, 9. Most frequent is 9. `output[1, 5] = 9`. Matches.
        *   `input[8, 5] = 4`. Neighbors in right half: `input[7, 5]=5`, `input[9, 5]=4`, `input[9, 6]=9`, `input[8, 6]=4`, `input[7, 6]=9`. Non-bg neighbors: 5, 9, 9. Most frequent is 9. `output[8, 5] = 9`. Matches.
        *   `input[8, 6] = 4`. Neighbors in right half: `input[7, 5]=5`, `input[8, 5]=4`, `input[9, 5]=4`, `input[9, 6]=9`, `input[9, 7]=9`, `input[8, 7]=5`, `input[7, 7]=9`. Non-bg neighbors: 5, 9, 9, 5, 9. Most frequent is 9. `output[8, 6] = 9`. Matches.
        *   `input[8, 8] = 4`. Neighbors in right half: `input[7, 7]=9`, `input[8, 7]=5`, `input[9, 7]=9`, `input[9, 8]=5`, `input[9, 9]=4`, `input[8, 9]=8`, `input[7, 9]=9`, `input[7, 8]=4`. Non-bg neighbors: 9, 5, 9, 5, 8, 9. Most frequent is 9 (3 times), then 5 (2 times), then 8 (1 time). Output[8, 8] is 5. **Doesn't match.**

    *   The simple "most frequent non-background neighbor" rule fails.
    *   What if ties are broken by proximity? Or by color value? Or position (e.g., prefer neighbor above)?
    *   Let's reconsider `input[8, 8]=4`. Non-bg neighbors: N/A, NE=9, E=8, SE=4(bg), S=5, SW=9, W=5, NW=9. Colors: {9: 3, 5: 2, 8: 1}. Output is 5. Why 5? Maybe the neighbor at (9, 8) which is 5? Or the neighbor at (8, 7) which is 5?
    *   What about `input[0, 9]=4`. Neighbors in right half: `input[0, 8]=9`, `input[1, 8]=5`, `input[1, 9]=4`. Non-bg neighbors: 9, 5. Tie. Output is 8. Where does 8 come from? The only 8 is at `input[8, 9]`. This suggests something non-local or iterative.

    *   **Final Hypothesis Structure:**
        1. Divide input into left/right halves (cols 0-4, 5-9).
        2. Process Left: Fill output left half with the most frequent color from input left half.
        3. Process Right:
           a. Find the most frequent color `C_right_bg` in input right half.
           b. Create a temporary grid T1, copy of input right half.
           c. Create a target grid T2, initialized same as T1.
           d. Repeat N times or until T2 stabilizes:
              i. For each cell `(r, c)` in T2:
                 - If `T1[r, c]` was *not* `C_right_bg`, `T2[r, c]` remains `T1[r, c]`. (Anchor points)
                 - If `T1[r, c]` *was* `C_right_bg`, calculate the new color for `T2[r, c]` based on its neighbors in the *previous* state of T2. Rule: Find the most frequent color among the 8 neighbors in the previous state. If `C_right_bg` is the most frequent neighbor, try the next most frequent. If still tied, use a tie-breaker (e.g., lowest color index? Closest neighbor? Pixel above?).
              ii. Update T2 for the next iteration.
           e. The final state of T2 is the output right half.

    *   This iterative "Cellular Automaton"-like process seems plausible for the smoothing/filling effect. The "anchor points" are the non-background pixels from the original input right half. The background pixels get filled based on their neighbors iteratively.
    *   Tie-breaking is still unclear. Let's try "most frequent neighbor color, excluding `C_right_bg`. If tie, use the color with the lowest numerical value."
    *   Test `input[8, 8]=4` (`train_1`). `C_right_bg=4`. Neighbors: {9: 3, 5: 2, 8: 1}. Exclude 4. Frequencies: {9: 3, 5: 2, 8: 1}. Most frequent is 9. Output is 5. Doesn't work.
    *   Try tie-breaking: "lowest color index". Neighbors: 9, 5, 8. Lowest is 5. Output is 5. OK!
    *   Test `input[0, 9]=4`. Neighbors: {9: 1, 5: 1}. Tie. Lowest color index is 5. Output is 8. Doesn't work.

    *   Maybe the tie-breaker is positional? Prefer color above?
    *   `input[8, 8]=4`. Neighbor above is `input[7, 8]=4` (bg).
    *   `input[0, 9]=4`. Neighbor above doesn't exist.

    *   **Let's focus on the structure:** The output seems to be formed by vertical bands in the right half.
        `train_1`: Col 5-7 are 9. Col 8 is 5. Col 9 is 8/5.
        `train_2`: Col 5 mostly 2. Col 6-7 are 2. Col 8 is 5. Col 9 is 8/5.
    *   Could the rule be simpler? For each column `j` in the right half:
        1. Find most frequent color `C_right_bg` for the whole right half.
        2. Find the most frequent *non-bg* color `C_col` in input column `j`.
        3. Fill output column `j` with `C_col`?
        *   `train_1`: `C_right_bg=4`.
            *   Col 5: Non-bg `9,9,9,5,5`. Freq: {9:3, 5:2}. Most freq non-bg = 9. Output Col 5 = 9. OK.
            *   Col 6: Non-bg `9,9`. Freq: {9:2}. Most freq non-bg = 9. Output Col 6 = 9. OK.
            *   Col 7: Non-bg `5,9,5,9`. Freq: {5:2, 9:2}. Tie. Output Col 7 = 9. How is tie broken? Lowest index=5. Doesn't fit. Maybe highest index=9? OK.
            *   Col 8: Non-bg `9,5,9,9,5,5`. Freq: {9:3, 5:3}. Tie. Output Col 8 = 5. How? Lowest index=5. OK.
            *   Col 9: Non-bg `9,8`. Freq: {9:1, 8:1}. Tie. Output Col 9 = 8/5. Doesn't fit simple fill.

    *   The simple column fill based on most frequent non-background color (with some tie-breaker) almost works but fails on ties and column 9. Column 9 seems special.

    *   **Revised Right Half Hypothesis:**
        1. Find `C_right_bg` (most frequent color in input right half).
        2. For each column `j` (5 to 8):
           a. Find frequencies of non-`C_right_bg` colors in input column `j`.
           b. If no non-`C_right_bg` colors, maybe fill with `C_right_bg`? (Check examples - doesn't seem to happen here).
           c. Determine the dominant color `C_dom` for the column: the non-`C_right_bg` color with the highest frequency.
           d. Break ties: If counts are equal, choose the color with the *lowest numerical value*.
           e. Fill output column `j` entirely with `C_dom`.
        3. For the last column (column 9):
           a. Find the highest non-`C_right_bg` pixel: `input[r_top, 9] = C_top`.
           b. Find the lowest non-`C_right_bg` pixel: `input[r_bot, 9] = C_bot`.
           c. Fill output column 9 from row 0 to `r_top` with `C_top`.
           d. Fill output column 9 from row `r_top + 1` to end with `C_bot`. (This assumes `r_top <= r_bot` and both exist).

    *   Test this full hypothesis:
        *   **`train_1`**: `C_left = 4`. `C_right_bg = 4`.
            *   Output Left Half: All 4. OK.
            *   Right Half:
                *   Col 5: Non-bg {9:3, 5:2}. Max freq=9. `C_dom=9`. Output Col 5 = 9. OK.
                *   Col 6: Non-bg {9:2}. Max freq=9. `C_dom=9`. Output Col 6 = 9. OK.
                *   Col 7: Non-bg {5:2, 9:2}. Tie. Lowest index = 5. `C_dom=5`. Output Col 7 = 5. **FAILS** (Output is 9). --> Maybe tie-break is *highest* numerical value? If tie-break=highest value: `C_dom=9`. Output Col 7 = 9. OK.
                *   Col 8: Non-bg {9:3, 5:3}. Tie. Highest value = 9. `C_dom=9`. Output Col 8 = 9. **FAILS** (Output is 5). --> Tie-break rule inconsistent. Let's stick to lowest value for now. Col 7 fails, Col 8 fails (if tie break=lowest value).

        *   **Let's rethink the tie break.** Could it be related to the *position* of the tied colors?
            *   Col 7: `5 @ r=1`, `9 @ r=2`, `5 @ r=6`, `9 @ r=7`. Tied 5s and 9s. Output is 9. The highest 9 is @ r=2. The highest 5 is @ r=1. Highest overall non-bg is 5.
            *   Col 8: `9 @ r=0`, `5 @ r=1`, `9 @ r=3`, `9 @ r=6`, `5 @ r=8`, `5 @ r=9`. Tied 9s and 5s. Output is 5. Highest 9 is @ r=0. Highest 5 is @ r=1. Highest overall non-bg is 9.

        *   Maybe the tie-breaker is: Choose the color that appears *highest* (minimum row index) in the column?
            *   Col 7: 5 appears at r=1, 9 appears at r=2. Highest is 5. `C_dom=5`. Output is 9. NO.
            *   Col 8: 9 appears at r=0, 5 appears at r=1. Highest is 9. `C_dom=9`. Output is 5. NO.

        *   Maybe the tie-breaker is: Choose the color that appears *lowest* (maximum row index) in the column?
            *   Col 7: 5 last appears at r=6, 9 last appears at r=7. Lowest is 9. `C_dom=9`. Output is 9. OK.
            *   Col 8: 9 last appears at r=6, 5 last appears at r=9. Lowest is 5. `C_dom=5`. Output is 5. OK.
            *   **New Tie-Breaker:** If frequencies are tied, choose the color whose lowest instance (max row index) in the column is lower (larger row index) than the other tied colors.

        *   Let's re-test rule for cols 5-8 with this tie-breaker:
            *   Col 5: {9:3, 5:2}. `C_dom=9`. Output Col 5 = 9. OK.
            *   Col 6: {9:2}. `C_dom=9`. Output Col 6 = 9. OK.

Processes the input grid according to the following transformation rules:

1.  Divide the input grid vertically into two halves based on the middle column index (`mid = width // 2`). The left half includes columns `0` to `mid-1`, and the right half includes columns `mid` to `width-1`.
2.  Left Half Transformation:
    a. Find the most frequent color (`C_left`) in the input grid's left half. If there's a tie in frequency, the color with the lowest numerical value is chosen.
    b. Fill the output grid's left half entirely with this `C_left` color.
3.  Right Half Transformation:
    a. Find the most frequent color (`C_right_bg`) in the input grid's right half. This acts as the 'background' color. Tie-breaking uses the lowest numerical value.
    b. Process columns `j` from the middle index (`mid`) up to, but not including, the last column (`width-1`):
        i. Identify all pixels in the input column `j` whose color is *not* `C_right_bg`. Store them as `(color, row_index)` pairs.
        ii. If no such non-background pixels exist in the column, fill the corresponding output column `j` entirely with `C_right_bg`.
        iii. If non-background pixels exist, determine the dominant color (`C_dom`) for the column:
            - Find the non-background color with the highest frequency in the column.
            - If there's a tie in frequency, compare the tied colors based on the row index of their lowest occurrence (maximum row index) in the column. The color whose lowest instance is further down (larger row index) wins the tie.
            - If there's still a tie (multiple colors have their lowest instance on the same maximum row), choose the color with the lowest numerical value among them.
        iv. Fill the entire output column `j` with this dominant color `C_dom`.
    c. Process the last column (`j = width - 1`):
        i. Identify all non-`C_right_bg` pixels `(color, row_index)` in the input's last column.
        ii. If no such non-background pixels exist, fill the output's last column entirely with `C_right_bg`.
        iii. If non-background pixels exist:
            - Find the pixel `(C_top, r_top)` among them that has the minimum row index (`r_top`).
            - Find the pixel `(C_bot, r_bot)` among them that has the maximum row index (`r_bot`). Note: `C_bot` is the color at the maximum row index, not necessarily the color with the highest value.
            - Fill the output's last column from row 0 down to `r_top` (inclusive) with the color `C_top`.
            - Fill the output's last column from row `r_top + 1` down to the last row with the color `C_bot`.

        *   Ex2: Most frequent non-bg in right half is 2 (Red). Output cols 6, 7 are 2. Col 5 is mostly 2. Col 8 is 5.
        *   This doesn't seem to directly map.

        *   **Alternative:** What if the fill color for output column `j` (for `j` in `mid` to `width-2`) is determined by the color of the *single topmost* non-background pixel in the corresponding *input* column `j`?
            *   Ex1 (`bg=4`):
                *   Col 5: Top non-bg is 9 (row 0). Output Col 5 = 9. OK.
                *   Col 6: Top non-bg is 9 (row 2). Output Col 6 = 9. OK.

                *   Col 5: Top non-bg is 5 (row 0). Output Col 5 = mostly 2. NO. Fails.
                *   Col 6: Top non-bg is 2 (row 1). Output Col 6 = 2. OK.

                *   Col 8: Top non-bg is 2 (row 1). Output Col 8 = 5. NO. Fails.

        *   This "topmost non-bg pixel" rule also fails.

        *   **Let's reconsider the specific failures:**
            *   Ex1, Col 7: Expected 5. Input Col 7 non-bg: `(5,1), (9,2), (9,6), (9,7), (5,8), (9,9)`. Why 5?
            *   Ex2, Col 5: Expected mostly 2. Input Col 5 non-bg: `(5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (2,7), (8,8), (8,9)`. Why 2?
            *   Ex2, Col 7: Expected 2. Input Col 7 non-bg: `(5,2), (5,3), (8,5), (5,8), (5,9)`. Why 2?
            *   Ex2, Col 8: Expected 5. Input Col 8 non-bg: `(2,1), (2,2), (2,7), (2,8), (5,9)`. Why 5?

        *   **Key Insight from Ex2 Output Col 5:** `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 6`. The 6 at the bottom `output[9, 5]` corresponds to `input[9, 5]=8`. And `input[8, 5]=8`. The top non-bg is 5. Most freq is 5. This column is strange. What if `C_right_bg` was 5 instead of 6?
            *   Recalculate `C_right_bg` for Ex2: Freqs {6: 25, 2: 12, 5: 8, 8: 5}. Most frequent is 6. It's correct.
            *   What if the *single* non-bg pixel at `input[9,5]` is treated specially? It's an 8. The output is 6. Where does 6 come from? It's the background color! Maybe if a column has a non-bg pixel only at the very bottom? No, `input[8,5]` is also 8. `input[7,5]` is 2.
            *   Look at Input Col 5 again: `5 5 5 5 6 6 6 2 8 8`. Output: `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 6`. The only '2' is at `input[7, 5]`. The only '6' (bg) is at `input[4,5], input[5,5], input[6,5]`.
            *   This looks like some kind of vertical propagation or signal.

        *   **Vertical Propagation Idea:** For each column `j` in the right half:
            1.  Find `C_right_bg`.
            2.  Scan the input column `j` from top to bottom.
            3.  Keep track of the 'current signal color'. Initialize it (e.g., to `C_right_bg` or null).
            4.  If `input[r, j]` is `C_right_bg`, the `output[r, j]` takes the 'current signal color'.
            5.  If `input[r, j]` is *not* `C_right_bg`, it potentially *updates* the 'current signal color' for subsequent rows *and* sets `output[r, j]` to this new color. How is the signal updated? Maybe the first non-bg color becomes the signal?

            *   Let's try this on Ex2, Col 5 (`bg=6`):
                *   r=0: input=5 (non-bg). Signal becomes 5. output[0, 5] = 5.
                *   r=1: input=5 (non-bg). Signal stays 5. output[1, 5] = 5.
                *   r=2: input=5 (non-bg). Signal stays 5. output[2, 5] = 5.
                *   r=3: input=5 (non-bg). Signal stays 5. output[3, 5] = 5.
                *   r=4: input=6 (bg). output[4, 5] takes signal = 5.
                *   r=5: input=6 (bg). output[5, 5] takes signal = 5.
                *   r=6: input=6 (bg). output[6, 5] takes signal = 5.
                *   r=7: input=2 (non-bg). Signal *changes* to 2? output[7, 5] = 2.
                *   r=8: input=8 (non-bg). Signal *changes* to 8? output[8, 5] = 8.
                *   r=9: input=8 (non-bg). Signal stays 8? output[9, 5] = 8.
                *   Result: `5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 8 8`. Doesn't match `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 6`.

            *   What if the signal only propagates *downwards* from the *first* non-background color encountered?
            *   Ex2, Col 5 (`bg=6`): First non-bg is 5 at r=0. Signal is 5.
                *   output[0,5]=5. output[1,5]=5. ... output[6,5]=5.
                *   At r=7, input=2 (non-bg). Output is 2. Does signal change?
                *   At r=8, input=8 (non-bg). Output is 8. Does signal change?
                *   Still doesn't match.

            *   Maybe the color used to fill is the *last* non-background color seen *above* the current cell?
            *   Ex2, Col 5 (`bg=6`):
                *   r=0: input=5. Output=5. Last non-bg above = None.
                *   r=1: input=5. Output=5. Last non-bg above = 5.
                *   ...
                *   r=4: input=6 (bg). Output = Last non-bg = 5.
                *   ...
                *   r=7: input=2. Output=2. Last non-bg above = 5.
                *   r=8: input=8. Output=8. Last non-bg above = 2.

                *   Result: `5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 8 8`. Still fails.

        *   **Let's revisit the "Dominant Color" idea but simplify the rule:**
            *   For output columns `j` from `mid` to `width-2`: Fill the column with the non-`C_right_bg` color that has the *highest frequency* in the input column `j`.
            *   Tie-breaking: Lowest numerical value? Highest numerical value? Topmost? Lowest?
            *   Test: **Tie-break = Lowest value**
                *   Ex1, Col 5: {9:3, 5:3}. Tie. Lowest=5. Output Col 5 = 5. **FAILS** (Expected 9).
                *   Ex1, Col 7: {5:2, 9:4}. Max freq=9. Output Col 7 = 9. **FAILS** (Expected 5).
            *   Test: **Tie-break = Highest value**
                *   Ex1, Col 5: {9:3, 5:3}. Tie. Highest=9. Output Col 5 = 9. OK.
                *   Ex1, Col 7: {5:2, 9:4}. Max freq=9. Output Col 7 = 9. **FAILS** (Expected 5).
            *   Test: **Tie-break = Topmost occurrence**
                *   Ex1, Col 5: 9@r=0, 5@r=1. Tie. Topmost=9. Output Col 5 = 9. OK.
                *   Ex1, Col 7: {5:2, 9:4}. Max freq=9. Output Col 7 = 9. **FAILS** (Expected 5).
            *   Test: **Tie-break = Lowest occurrence**
                *   Ex1, Col 5: 9@r=3, 5@r=7. Tie. Lowest=5. Output Col 5 = 5. **FAILS** (Expected 9).

        *   No simple frequency/tie-break rule seems to work for cols `mid` to `width-2`.

    *   **Hypothesis Refinement - Last Column (`width-1`):**
        *   Expected Output Ex1 Col 9: `8 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5`
        *   Input Col 9 (`bg=4`): `4 4 4 4 4 4 4 9 8 4`. Non-bg: `(9, 7), (8, 8)`.
        *   Topmost non-bg: 9 at r=7. Bottommost non-bg: 8 at r=8.
        *   Previous rule: Fill 0-7 with 9, 8-9 with 8. -> `9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 8 8`. Fails.
        *   Expected Output Ex2 Col 9: `8 8 8 8 8 8 5 5 5 5`
        *   Input Col 9 (`bg=6`): `6 6 2 2 2 8 8 6 6 6`. Non-bg: `(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (8,5), (8,6)`.
        *   Topmost non-bg: 2 at r=2. Bottommost non-bg: 8 at r=6.
        *   Previous rule: Fill 0-2 with 2, 3-9 with 8. -> `2 2 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`. Fails.

        *   **New Last Column Idea:** Look at the colors in the output last column. They seem to be drawn from the non-bg colors present in the input last column, but the split point and fill colors are different.
        *   Ex1: Output is 8 then 5. Input has 9 and 8. Where does 5 come from? 5 is the dominant color of the *previous* output column (Col 8).
        *   Ex2: Output is 8 then 5. Input has 2 and 8. Where does 5 come from? 5 is the dominant color of the *previous* output column (Col 8).

        *   **Revised Last Column Rule:**
            1. Find the color `C_prev` used to fill the *output* column `width-2`.
            2. Find the topmost non-`C_right_bg` pixel `(C_top, r_top)` in the *input* column `width-1`.
            3. Fill the *output* column `width-1` from row 0 to `r_top` (inclusive) with `C_top`.
            4. Fill the *output* column `width-1` from row `r_top + 1` to the end with `C_prev`.
            5. Handle edge case: If no non-`C_right_bg` pixel exists in input column `width-1`, fill output column `width-1` entirely with `C_prev`.

        *   Let's test this:
            *   Ex1: `C_right_bg=4`. Output Col 8 was filled with 5 (based on expected output). `C_prev=5`. Input Col 9 non-bg: `(9, 7), (8, 8)`. Topmost is 9 at r=7. `C_top=9`, `r_top=7`. Fill output 0-7 with 9. Fill output 8-9 with 5. Result: `9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 5 5`. **FAILS** (Expected `8 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5`).

            *   Ex2: `C_right_bg=6`. Output Col 8 was filled with 5 (based on expected output). `C_prev=5`. Input Col 9 non-bg: `(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (8,5), (8,6)`. Topmost is 2 at r=2. `C_top=2`, `r_top=2`. Fill output 0-2 with 2. Fill output 3-9 with 5. Result: `2 2 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5`. **FAILS** (Expected `8 8 8 8 8 8 5 5 5 5`).

    *   **Total Rethink on Right Half:** The column independence might be wrong. Maybe there's an interaction? Or perhaps the "background" definition is subtler.
    *   What if the "background" is simply the most frequent color in the *entire input grid*?

```
        *   Ex1: Most frequent overall is 4 (Yellow). This was the same as `C_left` and `C_right_bg`.
        *   Ex2: Most frequent overall is 6 (Magenta). This was the same as `C_left` and `C_right_bg`.
        *   So, using the overall most frequent color as background doesn't change anything.

    *   **Back to basics: What is fundamentally happening in the right half?**
        *   Input pixels with the background color are being replaced.
        *   Input pixels with non-background colors often persist, but sometimes change (e.g., the '6' in Ex2 Output Col 5).
        *   The output columns (esp. `mid` to `width-2`) seem to stabilize to a single dominant color.
        *   The last column has a split based on the top/bottom non-bg pixels in the input, but the fill colors seem influenced by neighbors or preceding columns.

    *   **Consider Gravity/Flood Fill:** What if non-background colors "fall" downwards, replacing background colors below them, until they hit another non-background color or the bottom?
        *   Ex1, Col 7 (`bg=4`): `4 5 9 4 4 4 9 9 5 9`
            *   r=0: bg. Look down. Hit 5 at r=1. Fill r=0 with 5.
            *   r=1: 5 (non-bg). Keep 5.
            *   r=2: 9 (non-bg). Keep 9.
            *   r=3: bg. Look down. Hit 9 at r=6. Fill r=3 with 9.
            *   r=4: bg. Look down. Hit 9 at r=6. Fill r=4 with 9.
            *   r=5: bg. Look down. Hit 9 at r=6. Fill r=5 with 9.
            *   r=6: 9 (non-bg). Keep 9.
            *   r=7: 9 (non-bg). Keep 9.
            *   r=8: 5 (non-bg). Keep 5.
            *   r=9: 9 (non-bg). Keep 9.
            *   Result Col 7: `5 5 9 9 9 9 9 9 5 9`. Doesn't match expected `5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5`.

    *   **Consider Propagation from Top:** What if the *first* non-background color sets the color for all background cells below it, until a *new* non-background color is encountered?
        *   Ex1, Col 7 (`bg=4`): `4 5 9 4 4 4 9 9 5 9`
            *   r=0: bg. Wait for signal.
            *   r=1: 5 (non-bg). Set signal=5. Output[1]=5. Fill previous bg cells: Output[0]=5.
            *   r=2: 9 (non-bg). Set signal=9. Output[2]=9.
            *   r=3: bg. Use signal=9. Output[3]=9.
            *   r=4: bg. Use signal=9. Output[4]=9.
            *   r=5: bg. Use signal=9. Output[5]=9.
            *   r=6: 9 (non-bg). Set signal=9. Output[6]=9.
            *   r=7: 9 (non-bg). Set signal=9. Output[7]=9.
            *   r=8: 5 (non-bg). Set signal=5. Output[8]=5.
            *   r=9: 9 (non-bg). Set signal=9. Output[9]=9.
            *   Result Col 7: `5 5 9 9 9 9 9 9 5 9`. Still wrong.

    *   **The "Fill with Dominant Color" idea for cols `mid` to `width-2` seemed closest, despite tie-break issues.** Let's re-examine the expected output vs inputs for the failing cases under that model.
        *   Ex1, Col 7: Input non-bg {5:2, 9:4}. Expected output is 5. Max freq is 9. Why 5?
        *   Ex2, Col 5: Input non-bg {5:4, 2:1, 8:2}. Expected output is 2 (mostly). Max freq is 5. Why 2?
        *   Ex2, Col 7: Input non-bg {5:4, 8:1}. Expected output is 2. Max freq is 5. Why 2?
        *   Ex2, Col 8: Input non-bg {2:4, 5:1}. Expected output is 5. Max freq is 2. Why 5?

        *   Could the "dominant" color be the one with the *smallest* count?
            *   Ex1, Col 7: {5:2, 9:4}. Smallest count=5. Output=5. OK.
            *   Ex2, Col 5: {5:4, 2:1, 8:2}. Smallest count=2. Output=2. OK.
            *   Ex2, Col 7: {5:4, 8:1}. Smallest count=8. Output=2. NO.
            *   Ex2, Col 8: {2:4, 5:1}. Smallest count=5. Output=5. OK.
            * Fails for Ex2 Col 7.

        *   Maybe it's not about frequency in the column, but some other property?
        *   Look at Ex1, Output Col 7 = 5. Input Col 7 non-bg colors are 5 and 9.
        *   Look at Ex2, Output Col 7 = 2. Input Col 7 non-bg colors are 5 and 8. Where does 2 come from? 2 is dominant in the *previous* column (Col 6).

        *   **New Hypothesis: Column Fill based on Previous Column?**
            *   For `j` from `mid` to `width-2`:
                *   Find `C_right_bg`.
                *   Find non-bg colors in input column `j`.
                *   If *no* non-bg colors, output col `j` = output col `j-1`? Or `C_right_bg`? Let's assume `C_right_bg`.
                *   If *one* non-bg color `C`, output col `j` = `C`.
                *   If *multiple* non-bg colors, output col `j` = output col `j-1`?
            *   What about the first column (`j=mid`)? Needs a base case. Maybe it uses frequency?

            *   Let's try:
                *   Base case: Output Col `mid` = Most frequent non-bg color in Input Col `mid`. (Tie-break: Lowest value?).
                *   For `j` from `mid+1` to `width-2`:
                    *   Count non-bg colors `N` in Input Col `j`.
                    *   If `N=0`, Output Col `j` = `C_right_bg`.
                    *   If `N=1` (color `C`), Output Col `j` = `C`.
                    *   If `N>1`, Output Col `j` = Output Col `j-1`.

            *   Test on Ex1 (`bg=4`, `mid=5`):
                *   Col 5: Non-bg {9:3, 5:3}. Tie. Lowest=5. Output Col 5 = 5. **FAILS** (Expected 9). Let's try tie-break = highest value. Tie-break=9. Output Col 5 = 9. OK.
                *   Col 6: Non-bg {9:2}. N=1. Color=9. Output Col 6 = 9. OK.
                *   Col 7: Non-bg {5:2, 9:4}. N>1. Output Col 7 = Output Col 6 = 9. **FAILS** (Expected 5).

    *   **Let's reconsider the last column logic.** Expected Output Ex1 Col 9: `8 8 5 5 ...`. Expected Output Ex2 Col 9: `8 8 8 8 8 8 5 5 ...`. The colors are 8 and 5. In both cases, 5 is the fill color from the previous column (Col 8). Where does the 8 come from?
        *   Ex1 Input Col 9 non-bg: `(9,7), (8,8)`.
        *   Ex2 Input Col 9 non-bg: `(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (8,5), (8,6)`.
        *   In both cases, 8 is present in the input column. Is it the *lowest* non-background color?
            *   Ex1: Lowest non-bg is 8 at r=8. `r_low=8`, `C_low=8`.
            *   Ex2: Lowest non-bg is 8 at r=6. `r_low=6`, `C_low=8`.
        *   **Revised Last Column Rule 2:**
            1. Find color `C_prev` used to fill *output* column `width-2`.
            2. Find the *lowest* non-`C_right_bg` pixel `(C_low, r_low)` in the *input* column `width-1`.
            3. Fill *output* column `width-1` from row 0 to `r_low` (inclusive) with `C_low`.
            4. Fill *output* column `width-1` from row `r_low + 1` to end with `C_prev`.
            5. Handle edge case: If no non-`C_right_bg` pixel, fill with `C_prev`.

        *   Test this:
            *   Ex1: `C_prev=5`. Lowest non-bg is `(8, 8)`. `C_low=8`, `r_low=8`. Fill 0-8 with 8. Fill 9 with 5. Result: `8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 5`. **FAILS** (Expected `8 8 5 5...`).

    *   Okay, the interaction seems complex. Let's assume the left half rule is correct. Let's focus purely on the right half mapping.
    *   Input Right 1 -> Output Right 1
    *   Input Right 2 -> Output Right 2

    *   Maybe look at unique colors per column?
        *   Ex1 Input Right:
            *   Col 5: {9, 4, 5} -> Output 9
            *   Col 6: {4, 9} -> Output 9
            *   Col 7: {4, 5, 9} -> Output 5
            *   Col 8: {9, 5, 4} -> Output 5
            *   Col 9: {4, 9, 8} -> Output 8/5 split
        *   Ex2 Input Right:
            *   Col 5: {5, 6, 2, 8} -> Output 2/6 split
            *   Col 6: {6, 2} -> Output 2
            *   Col 7: {6, 5, 8} -> Output 2
            *   Col 8: {6, 2, 5} -> Output 5
            *   Col 9: {6, 2, 8} -> Output 8/5 split

    *   This isn't revealing a simple pattern either.

    *   What if the fill color for cols `mid` to `width-2` is the *least* frequent non-background color in the column? (Tie break: highest value?)
        *   Ex1 (`bg=4`):
            *   Col 5: {9:3, 5:3}. Tie. Highest=9. Output=9. OK.
            *   Col 6: {9:2}. Only one non-bg. Output=9. OK.
            *   Col 7: {5:2, 9:4}. Least freq=5. Output=5. OK.
            *   Col 8: {9:2, 5:4}. Least freq=9. Output=5. NO.
        *   Ex2 (`bg=6`):
            *   Col 5: {5:4, 2:1, 8:2}. Least freq=2. Output=2/6. Close?
            *   Col 6: {2:5}. Only one non-bg. Output=2. OK.
            *   Col 7: {5:4, 8:1}. Least freq=8. Output=2. NO.
            *   Col 8: {2:4, 5:1}. Least freq=5. Output=5. OK.

    *   This "least frequent" idea works for more columns but still fails. The Ex2 Col 5 output having a '6' (background) is also really confusing.

    *   Let's revisit the last column split. Output always seems to split into `C1` then `C2`.
        *   Ex1: `8` then `5`. Input Col 9 non-bg: `(9,7), (8,8)`. `C_prev=5`.
        *   Ex2: `8` then `5`. Input Col 9 non-bg: `(2,2)...(8,6)`. `C_prev=5`.
        *   It seems `C2` is always `C_prev` (the fill color of output col `width-2`).
        *   `C1` seems to be related to the non-bg colors in the input column. In both cases, `C1=8`. 8 is present in both input columns. Is it the *lowest* non-bg color in the input column? Yes.
        *   The split point `r_split`? Output rows 0 to `r_split` are `C1`, rows `r_split+1` to end are `C2`.
            *   Ex1: `r_split=1`. Expected: `8 8 5...`. Lowest non-bg `(8, 8)`. `r_low=8`.
            *   Ex2: `r_split=5`. Expected: `8 8 8 8 8 8 5...`. Lowest non-bg `(8, 6)`. `r_low=6`.
        *   Rule attempt: `C1` = color of lowest non-bg pixel in input col `width-1`. `C2` = `C_prev`. `r_split` = row index of lowest non-bg pixel in input col `width-1`. Fill 0..`r_split` with `C1`, rest with `C2`.
            *   Ex1: `C1=8`, `C2=5`, `r_split=8`. Output: `8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 5`. Still fails.

        *   What if `C1` is the *highest* non-bg color in input col `width-1`?
            *   Ex1: Highest non-bg is `(9, 7)`. `C1=9`. Fails.
        *   What if `C1` is the *numerically lowest* non-bg color?
            *   Ex1: Non-bg 9, 8. Lowest is 8. `C1=8`.
            *   Ex2: Non-bg 2, 8. Lowest is 2. `C1=2`. Fails (Expected 8).
        *   What if `C1` is the *numerically highest* non-bg color?
            *   Ex1: Non-bg 9, 8. Highest is 9. `C1=9`. Fails.
            *   Ex2: Non-bg 2, 8. Highest is 8. `C1=8`. OK.
        *   Rule attempt: `C1` = numerically highest non-bg color in input col `width-1`. `C2` = `C_prev`. `r_split` = row index of *lowest* non-bg pixel?
            *   Ex1: `C1=9`, `C2=5`, `r_split=8`. Output: `9...9 (0-8), 5 (9)`. Fails.
            *   Ex2: `C1=8`, `C2=5`, `r_split=6`. Output: `8...8 (0-6), 5...5 (7-9)`. OK.

    *   This is inconsistent. The rules seem specific and arbitrary. Let's pause and rethink the overall goal. The process seems to be simplifying or cleaning the right half, column by column, potentially with influence from left-to-right. The last column seems to combine local information with info from the column to its left.

    *   **Final Attempt Strategy:**
        1.  Left Half: Fill with most frequent color (lowest value tie-break). (Seems solid).
        2.  Right Half Background (`C_right_bg`): Most frequent color in input right half (lowest value tie-break). (Seems solid).
        3.  Right Half Columns `mid` to `width-2`: Fill with the *least frequent* non-`C_right_bg` color present in the *input column*.
            *   Tie-breaking for least frequent: Choose the color with the *highest* numerical value.
            *   If only one non-`C_right_bg` color exists, use that color.
            *   If zero non-`C_right_bg` colors exist, fill with `C_right_bg`.
        4.  Right Half Last Column (`width-1`):
            *   Determine `C_prev` (fill color of output column `width-2`).
            *   Find all non-`C_right_bg` pixels `(c, r)` in input column `width-1`.
            *   If none exist, fill with `C_prev`.
            *   Otherwise:
                *   Find `C1` = the *numerically highest* color value among the non-`C_right_bg` pixels.
                *   Find `r_low` = the *maximum row index* among all non-`C_right_bg` pixels.
                *   `C2` = `C_prev`.
                *   Fill output rows 0 to `r_low` (inclusive) with `C1`.
                *   Fill output rows `r_low + 1` to end with `C2`.

    *   **Validate this strategy mentally:**
        *   Ex1 (`bg=4`):
            *   Left: OK (4).
            *   Col 5: {9:3, 5:3}. Least freq tie. Highest value=9. Output=9. OK.
            *   Col 6: {9:2}. Least freq=9. Output=9. OK.
            *   Col 7: {5:2, 9:4}. Least freq=5. Output=5. OK.
            *   Col 8: {9:2, 5:4}. Least freq=9. Output=9. **FAILS** (Expected 5). -> This strategy fails.

    *   Let's revert the rule for cols mid to width-2 to "Most Frequent" and try the new Last Column rule.
    *   **Strategy vNext:**
        1.  Left Half: Fill with most frequent color (lowest value tie-break).
        2.  Right Half Background (`C_right_bg`): Most frequent color in input right half (lowest value tie-break).
        3.  Right Half Columns `mid` to `width-2`: Fill with the *most frequent* non-`C_right_bg` color present in the *input column*.
            *   Tie-breaking for most frequent: Choose the color that appears *lowest* (max row index). If still tied, choose *lowest* numerical value. (This worked previously for Ex1 cols 5,6,8 but failed col 7 - expected 5, calculated 9). Let's recheck that tie break...
            *   Ex1, Col 7: Non-bg `(5,1), (9,2), (9,6), (9,7), (5,8), (9,9)`. Freq: {5:2, 9:4}. Most freq=9. Output=9. Fails (Expected 5).
            *   Ex1, Col 8: Non-bg `(9,0), (5,1), (9,3), (5,4), (5,6), (5,8)`. Freq: {9:2, 5:4}. Most freq=5. Output=5. OK.
            *   Let's retry the tie break used in the code: "lowest instance appears lower (larger row index)".
                *   Ex1, Col 5: {9:3, 5:3}. Tie. Max row 9 is 3. Max row 5 is 7. 5 wins. Output=5. **FAILS** (Expected 9).
            *   The "most frequent" rule seems problematic due to tie-breaks or fundamental flaws.

    *   What if the fill color for columns `mid` to `width-2` is based on the *colors present*, not frequency?
        *   If only one non-bg color C -> fill C
        *   If multiple non-bg colors -> ??? Maybe fill with the *lowest numerical value* non-bg color present?
            *   Ex1:
                *   Col 5: non-bg 9, 5. Lowest=5. **FAILS** (Exp 9).
                *   Col 6: non-bg 9. Lowest=9. OK.
                *   Col 7: non-bg 5, 9. Lowest=5. OK.
                *   Col 8: non-bg 9, 5. Lowest=5. OK.
            *   Ex2:
                *   Col 5: non-bg 5, 2, 8. Lowest=2. Output=2/6. OK-ish.
                *   Col 6: non-bg 2. Lowest=2. OK.
                *   Col 7: non-bg 5, 8. Lowest=5. **FAILS** (Exp 2).
                *   Col 8: non-bg 2, 5. Lowest=2. **FAILS** (Exp 5).

    *   This is tough. Let's stick with the "most frequent" rule for `mid` to `width-2` and accept it might be wrong, but try the proposed last column rule again.
    *   **Final Final Strategy:**
        1. Left Half: Fill with most frequent color (lowest value tie-break).
        2. Right Half Background (`C_right_bg`): Most frequent color in input right half (lowest value tie-break).
        3. Right Half Columns `mid` to `width-2`: Fill with the *most frequent* non-`C_right_bg` color present in the *input column*. Tie-break: Color whose *lowest* instance (max row index) is *lowest* (max row index wins). Final tie-break: *Lowest* numerical value. (This matches the failed code attempt's logic).
        4. Right Half Last Column (`width-1`):
            *   Determine `C_prev` (fill color of output column `width-2` *based on step 3's calculation*).
            *   Find all non-`C_right_bg` pixels `(c, r)` in input column `width-1`.
            *   If none exist, fill with `C_prev`.
            *   Otherwise:
                *   Find `C1` = the *numerically highest* color value among the non-`C_right_bg` pixels.
                *   Find `r_low` = the *maximum row index* among all non-`C_right_bg` pixels.
                *   `C2` = `C_prev`.
                *   Fill output rows 0 to `r_low` (inclusive) with `C1`.
                *   Fill output rows `r_low + 1` to end with `C2`.

    *   This seems like the most plausible combination tested so far, acknowledging step 3 might be imperfect.

## General Assessment

The previous attempt correctly identified the division of the grid and the rule for the left half. However, the logic for the right half failed significantly. The errors indicate that the column processing rules (frequency analysis, tie-breaking, last-column special handling) were incorrect. The transformation in the right half appears to be a column-based simplification or propagation, but the exact mechanism is proving difficult to pin down, especially regarding tie-breaking and the interaction for the final column. The strategy is to refine the column-processing rules for the right half based on the observed errors and expected outputs.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's recalculate the key values for the right half based on the final proposed strategy's logic for columns `mid` to `width-2` (most frequent non-bg, tie-break: lowest position -> lowest value).

**Example 1:**
*   Input Grid: 10x10. `mid=5`.
*   Input Left Half (0-4): Most frequent = 4 (Yellow). Output Left Half = All 4s.
*   Input Right Half (5-9): Most frequent (`C_right_bg`) = 4 (Yellow).
*   Input Col 5: Non-bg `(9,0), (5,1), (9,2), (9,3), (5,6), (5,7)`. Freq {9:3, 5:3}. Tie. Max row 9=3, Max row 5=7. 5 wins tie-break 1. `C_dom=5`.
*   Input Col 6: Non-bg `(9,2), (9,6)`. Freq {9:2}. `C_dom=9`.
*   Input Col 7: Non-bg `(5,1), (9,2), (9,6), (9,7), (5,8), (9,9)`. Freq {5:2, 9:4}. `C_dom=9`.
*   Input Col 8: Non-bg `(9,0), (5,1), (9,3), (5,4), (5,6), (5,8)`. Freq {9:2, 5:4}. `C_dom=5`.
*   Output Cols 5-8 (calculated): 5, 9, 9, 5.
*   `C_prev` (for Col 9 calc) = 5.
*   Input Col 9: Non-bg `(9,7), (8,8)`. Numerically highest non-bg `C1=9`. Lowest position `r_low=8`. `C2=C_prev=5`. Output Col 9: Rows 0-8 = 9, Row 9 = 5.
*   Predicted Output Right Half:
    
```
    5 9 9 5 9
    5 9 9 5 9
    5 9 9 5 9
    5 9 9 5 9
    5 9 9 5 9
    5 9 9 5 9
    5 9 9 5 9
    5 9 9 5 9
    5 9 9 5 9
    5 9 9 5 5
    ```

*   Expected Output Right Half:
    
```
    9 9 9 5 8
    9 9 9 5 8
    9 9 9 5 5
    9 9 9 5 5
    ...
    ```

*   This strategy still fails significantly.

**Let's use the expected values for `C_prev` when calculating the last column, assuming the rule for cols `mid` to `width-2` needs fixing, but the *last column rule itself* might be okay relative to the *actual* preceding column.**

*   **Revised Final Strategy Check:**
    1. Left Half Rule: OK.
    2. Right Half BG: OK.
    3. **Assume cols `mid` to `width-2` are somehow calculated correctly according to Expected Output.**
    4. Test only the **Last Column Rule (vFinalFinal):**
        *   `C1` = numerically highest non-bg color in input col `width-1`.
        *   `r_low` = max row index of any non-bg pixel in input col `width-1`.
        *   `C2` = the actual color filling the *expected output* column `width-2`.
        *   Fill output col `width-1` rows 0 to `r_low` with `C1`. Fill `r_low+1` to end with `C2`.

    *   Ex1: Expected Output Col 8 is 5. So `C2=5`. Input Col 9 non-bg: `(9,7), (8,8)`. Highest value `C1=9`. Lowest pos `r_low=8`. Fill 0-8 with 9. Fill 9 with 5. -> `9...9, 5`. **FAILS** (Expected `8 8 5...`).

    *   Ex2: Expected Output Col 8 is 5. So `C2=5`. Input Col 9 non-bg: `(2,2)...(8,6)`. Highest value `C1=8`. Lowest pos `r_low=6`. Fill 0-6 with 8. Fill 7-9 with 5. -> `8...8 (0-6), 5 5 5 (7-9)`. **MATCHES!**

*   **Conclusion:** The last column rule works for Example 2 but not Example 1. The rule for columns `mid` to `width-2` is definitely wrong. The entire right-half logic needs a fundamental rethink.

*   **Revisit Core Idea:** Simplify the right half by removing background (`C_right_bg`) and propagating the remaining colors. Maybe the propagation isn't frequency-based but position-based?

*   **Hypothesis: Gravity Fill**
    1. Identify `C_right_bg`.
    2. Create output right half, initially empty or matching input.
    3. Iterate columns `j` from `mid` to `width-1`.
    4. For each column `j`: Iterate rows `r` from `height-1` up to 0.
    5. If `input[r, j]` is NOT `C_right_bg`, then `output[r, j] = input[r, j]`.
    6. If `input[r, j]` IS `C_right_bg`:
        *   If `r == height-1`, `output[r, j] = C_right_bg` (or maybe color from cell below if grid wrapped?). Let's stick to `C_right_bg`.
        *   If `r < height-1`, `output[r, j] = output[r+1, j]` (color from cell directly below in the *output* being built).

    *   Test Gravity Fill on Ex1 Right Half (`bg=4`):
        *   Col 5: Input `9 4 9 9 4 4 5 5 4 4`. Output built bottom-up:
            *   r=9: input=4(bg). output[9]=4.
            *   r=8: input=4(bg). output[8]=output[9]=4.
            *   r=7: input=5. output[7]=5.
            *   r=6: input=5. output[6]=5.
            *   r=5: input=4(bg). output[5]=output[6]=5.
            *   r=4: input=4(bg). output[4]=output[5]=5.
            *   r=3: input=9. output[3]=9.
            *   r=2: input=9. output[2]=9.
            *   r=1: input=4(bg). output[1]=output[2]=9.
            *   r=0: input=9. output[0]=9.
            *   Result Col 5: `9 9 9 9 5 5 5 5 4 4`. **FAILS** (Expected 9).

    *   **Hypothesis: Top Propagation**
        1. Identify `C_right_bg`.
        2. Create output right half.
        3. Iterate columns `j` from `mid` to `width-1`.
        4. `current_color = C_right_bg`.
        5. For each column `j`: Iterate rows `r` from 0 to `height-1`.
        6. If `input[r, j]` is NOT `C_right_bg`, update `current_color = input[r, j]`.
        7. Set `output[r, j] = current_color`.

    *   Test Top Propagation on Ex1 Right Half (`bg=4`):
        *   Col 5: Input `9 4 9 9 4 4 5 5 4 4`.
            *   r=0: input=9. current=9. output[0]=9.
            *   r=1: input=4(bg). current=9. output[1]=9.
            *   r=2: input=9. current=9. output[2]=9.
            *   r=3: input=9. current=9. output[3]=9.
            *   r=4: input=4(bg). current=9. output[4]=9.
            *   r=5: input=4(bg). current=9. output[5]=9.
            *   r=6: input=5. current=5. output[6]=5.
            *   r=7: input=5. current=5. output[7]=5.
            *   r=8: input=4(bg). current=5. output[8]=5.
            *   r=9: input=4(bg). current=5. output[9]=5.
            *   Result Col 5: `9 9 9 9 9 9 5 5 5 5`. **FAILS** (Expected 9).

    *   Okay, the logic seems tied to the specific examples. Let's look ONLY at Example 1 right half transformation.
        *   Input Cols 5,6 -> Output Cols 5,6 (All 9s)
        *   Input Cols 7,8 -> Output Cols 7,8 (All 5s)
        *   Input Col 9 -> Output Col 9 (Split 8/5)
        *   Why 9 for 5
