The input grids contain multiple distinct objects composed of different colors and shapes scattered on a white background. The output grid is the minimal bounding box containing the selected object. The key challenge lies in determining the criteria for selecting the correct object among several candidates. The examples suggest a two-step process: first, identifying objects whose specific pattern (color and shape) is unique within the input grid, and second, selecting from these unique objects based on a property, which appears to be symmetry. The object with the highest degree of symmetry (preferring both horizontal and vertical, then either one) among the uniquely patterned objects is chosen.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
