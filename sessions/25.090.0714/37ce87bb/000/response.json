A vertical line object consists of contiguous pixels of the same non-orange color (red or azure) all located in the same column.\n    2.  If no vertical line objects are found, return the input grid unchanged.\n    3.  Determine the vertical line object with the largest column index (the \"rightmost line\").

Count the total number of vertical line objects identified (`num_objects`).\n    5.  Calculate the column index for the new gray line: `col_G = col_R + 2`.\n    6.  Calculate the end row for the new gray line: `end_G = end_R`.\n    7.  Calculate the start row for the new gray line (`start_G`) based on the color of the rightmost line and the total number of lines:\n        *   If `color_R` is red (2), set `start_G = end_G`.\n        *   If `color_R` is azure (8):\n            *   If `num_objects` is 2, set `start_G = max(0, start_R - 2)`.\n            *   If `num_objects` is 3, set `start_G = max(0, start_R - 1)`.\n            *   (Assume behavior for other counts is undefined by examples, proceed only if count is 2 or 3 when rightmost is azure).\n    8.  Create a copy of the input grid.\n    9.  If `col_G` is a valid column index within the grid's width, draw a vertical line of gray (5) pixels in column `col_G` from row `start_G` to `end_G` (inclusive) onto the copied grid.\n    10.
