    description: Contiguous vertical segment of non-background color pixels in a single column.
    properties:
      - color: Integer color value (2 or 8).
      - col: Column index.
      - start_row: Topmost row index.
      - end_row: Bottommost row index.
derived_properties:
  - rightmost_line: The vertical_line object with the maximum 'col' value.
  - num_lines: The total count of vertical_line objects.
actions:
  - identify_vertical_lines: Find all vertical_line objects in the input grid.
  - find_rightmost_line_properties: If lines exist, identify the rightmost_line and extract its color (color_R), column index (col_R), start row (start_R), and end row (end_R).
  - count_lines: Determine num_lines.
  - calculate_new_line_properties:
      inputs: color_R, col_R, start_R, end_R, num_lines
      outputs: col_G, start_G, end_G
      logic:
        - col_G = col_R + 2
        - end_G = end_R
        - if color_R == 2:
            start_G = end_G
          elif color_R == 8:
            if num_lines == 2:
              start_G = max(0, start_R - 2)
            elif num_lines >= 3:
              start_G = max(0, start_R - 1)
            else: # Handle unexpected num_lines counts for azure, e.g., num_lines == 1
              start_G = -1 # Indicate no line should be drawn
          else: # Handle unexpected rightmost line colors
            start_G = -1 # Indicate no line should be drawn
  - draw_line: If start_G is valid (not -1) and col_G is within grid bounds, draw a vertical line of gray (5) pixels in column col_G from start_G to end_G (inclusive) onto a copy of the input grid.
relationships:
  - The position (column) of the new gray line is determined relative to the column of the rightmost input vertical line (`col_G = col_R + 2`).
  - The vertical extent (start/end rows) of the new gray line depends on the properties (color, start/end rows) of the rightmost input vertical line and the total count of vertical lines in the input.
