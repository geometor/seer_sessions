Some white pixels change color, while others remain white.\n    *   The change in white pixels seems dependent on their proximity to blue pixels. Specifically, white pixels that are cardinally adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to at least one blue pixel in the input grid are changed to yellow (4) in the output grid.\n    *   White pixels that are not cardinally adjacent to any blue pixels remain white in the output grid.\n\n*   **YAML Fact Document:**\n    "
