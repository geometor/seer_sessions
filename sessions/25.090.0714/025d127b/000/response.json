The vertical positions remain unchanged.\n6.  **Object Integrity:** The shapes and colors of the objects are preserved during the shift. No pixels are added or removed from the objects themselves, they are just relocated.\n7.  **Multiple Objects:** When multiple objects are present (as in `train_2`), all objects undergo the same transformation.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
