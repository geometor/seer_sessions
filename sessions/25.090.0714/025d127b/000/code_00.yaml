task_description: Translate all non-background objects horizontally.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects_present: true
objects:
  - type: contiguous_colored_pixels
    properties:
      - color: varies (azure, magenta, red in examples)
      - shape: preserved during transformation
      - location: changes during transformation
actions:
  - name: horizontal_translation
    parameters:
      - direction: right
      - magnitude: 1 column
    target: all non-white pixels (or objects)
relationships:
  - all_objects_translated: Every distinct object in the input grid undergoes the same translation.
  - background_unchanged: White pixels remain white unless overwritten by a translated pixel.
  - boundaries: Pixels are shifted within the grid boundaries. The examples do not show wrapping or pixels moving off the edge and disappearing, but imply that the leftmost column becomes white (or background) where objects previously were.
