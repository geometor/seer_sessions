Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids of pixels, primarily white (0), with colored objects embedded within them.
2.  **Objects:** The colored pixels form distinct contiguous shapes (objects).
    *   In `train_1`, there is one azure (8) object.
    *   In `train_2`, there are two objects: one magenta (6) and one red (2).
3.  **Background:** The background is consistently white (0).
4.  **Transformation:** By comparing the input and output grids in each example, the colored objects appear to have shifted horizontally.
5.  **Direction and Magnitude:** In both examples, the shift is consistently one column to the right. The vertical positions remain unchanged.
6.  **Object Integrity:** The shapes and colors of the objects are preserved during the shift. No pixels are added or removed from the objects themselves, they are just relocated.
7.  **Multiple Objects:** When multiple objects are present (as in `train_2`), all objects undergo the same transformation.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Translate all non-background objects horizontally.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects_present: true
objects:
  - type: contiguous_colored_pixels
    properties:
      - color: varies (azure, magenta, red in examples)
      - shape: preserved during transformation
      - location: changes during transformation
actions:
  - name: horizontal_translation
    parameters:
      - direction: right
      - magnitude: 1 column
    target: all non-white pixels (or objects)
relationships:
  - all_objects_translated: Every distinct object in the input grid undergoes the same translation.
  - background_unchanged: White pixels remain white unless overwritten by a translated pixel.
  - boundaries: Pixels are shifted within the grid boundaries. The examples do not show wrapping or pixels moving off the edge and disappearing, but imply that the leftmost column becomes white (or background) where objects previously were.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0).
2.  For each non-white pixel identified at position (row, column), move it to the new position (row, column + 1) in the output grid, keeping its original color.
3.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the white (0) background color.
4.  Place the translated non-white pixels onto the output grid at their new calculated positions. If a pixel would be moved beyond the right boundary of the grid, it is effectively discarded (not placed on the output grid).
```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Identifies all non-background (non-white) pixels in the input grid and
    translates them one position to the right. The output grid is initialized
    as all white (0), and then populated with the translated pixels. Pixels
    shifted beyond the right boundary are discarded.
    """
    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation
    input_np = np.array(input_grid)
    height, width = input_np.shape

    # Initialize output_grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0)
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_np)

    # Iterate through each pixel of the input grid
    for r in range(height):
        for c in range(width):
            # Check if the current pixel is not the background color (white, 0)
            if input_np[r, c] != 0:
                # Calculate the new column position (shift right by 1)
                new_c = c + 1

                # Check if the new column position is within the grid boundaries
                if new_c < width:
                    # Assign the color of the input pixel to the new position in the output grid
                    output_grid[r, new_c] = input_np[r, c]

    # Return the modified grid as a list of lists
    return output_grid.tolist()
```
