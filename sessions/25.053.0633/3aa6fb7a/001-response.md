Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to understand the transformation.

Here's a breakdown of my observations and the deduced transformation rule:



```yaml
observations:
  - grid_size: 7x7
  - input_colors:
    - 0: white
    - 8: azure
  - output_colors:
    - 0: white
    - 1: blue
    - 8: azure
  - object_types:
    - azure_shapes: Two separate L-shaped objects, one in the top-left and another in the bottom-right.
  - changes:
      - One azure pixel in each of the L shapes becomes blue.
      - The azure to blue change is always the pixel that is "inside" the "L" shape or "adjacent to the vertical and horizontal lines of the L"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all connected azure (8) shapes in the input grid. In this case identify "L" shaped azure objects.
2.  **Locate Inner Pixel**: Find, in each L shape, the azure pixel where a vertical and horizontal azure pixel neighbor it.
3.  **Change color**: Change the color of identified pixel to blue (1).
4. **Preserve other pixels:** All other pixels in the input grid retain the same color.

In summary, the transformation identifies "L"-shaped azure colored objects, and changes
the "inside" pixel from azure to blue while all other pixels remain the same.
