The transformation acts differently on these two parts. The previous concept of an \"inside border pixel\" is not correct.\n*    The old program was looking for an \"inside border pixel\", which does not exist in ARC.\n\n*   **Complete Removal of Border:** The examples show the *entire* exterior border is removed, not just a single pixel.\n\n* **Complete Interior Fill** All the inside pixels are recolored, not just one.\n"
