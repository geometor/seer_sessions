Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate 1x2 azure rectangles, one in top-left and the other bottom-right."
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate 1x2 azure rectangles, with no changes to initial blocks."
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: "Two 1x1 blue squares"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Rectangles:** Locate all azure (color 8) colored objects in the input grid. In this case, there are two disconnected 2x1 azure rectangles.

2.  **Locate Empty Spots:** Iterate the positions next to the detected azure objects
    and search for white (color 0) cells.

3.  **Fill with Blue:** If, next to the object, there is a white (color 0) cell, change its color to blue (color 1). Top-left azure object only changes the first available empty position. The second azure object only fills one empty adjacent slot with blue.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule identifies disconnected azure rectangles, and for two of them, fills one adjacent white cell to blue.
