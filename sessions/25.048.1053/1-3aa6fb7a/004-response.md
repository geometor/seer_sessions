Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate L-shapes.
  dimensions: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate L-shapes.
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,3)]
      shape: single pixels.
  dimensions: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct L-shaped objects formed by color 8 (azure). The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white).

2.  **Detect Corner Pixel**: The corner of the object is changed.

3.  **Change Color:** The corner is colored to blue (color 1).

4. **No change**: If a pixel is not part of the L-shape objects, don't change it.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule is: Find the upper-left azure pixel of each "L" shape and switch the azure pixel to blue.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is: Find the inner corner pixel of each L-shaped azure (color 8) object and change its color to blue (color 1).
