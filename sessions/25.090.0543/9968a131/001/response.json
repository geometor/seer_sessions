If a row starts with the sequence [7, 8, 3, 7] (orange, azure, green, orange), \n   the middle two elements [8, 3] are transformed into [7, 8] (orange, azure) \n   and the fourth element 7 (orange) is transformed into 3 (green). \n   The modified sequence becomes [7, 7, 8, 3]. The rest of the row, if any, remains unchanged.\n   Specifically, input `[7, 8, 3, 7]` becomes output `[7, 7, 8, 3]`.\n\n2. If a row starts with the sequence [5, 0, 7] (gray, white, orange), \n   this sequence is transformed into [7, 5, 0] (orange, gray, white). \n   The rest of the row, if any, remains unchanged.\n\n3.
