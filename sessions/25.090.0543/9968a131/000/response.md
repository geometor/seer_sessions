Okay, let's analyze the provided examples train_1 and train_2 to understand the transformation rules.

**Analysis of Example train_1**

*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids are both 4x4.
    *   The colors involved are orange (7), green (3), and azure (8).
    *   Comparing the input and output, rows 0 and 2 are unchanged.
    *   Rows 1 and 3 are identical in the input (`7 8 3 7`) and are transformed identically in the output (`7 7 8 3`).
    *   The transformation seems to depend on the content of the row. Rows starting `7 3 ...` are unchanged, while rows starting `7 8 ...` are changed.
    *   Specifically, if a row has azure (8) in the second column (index 1), then the sub-sequence from the second to the fourth column (indices 1, 2, 3) is transformed.
    *   The original sub-sequence `8 3 7` becomes `7 8 3`.
    *   This transformation can be described as a specific mapping applied to the values in these positions: the original value 8 becomes 7, the original value 3 becomes 8, and the original value 7 becomes 3.

*   **Facts:**

        input: row_segment (indices 1, 2, 3)
        condition: result of check_condition_on_row is true
        output: transformed_row_segment
        rule:

        output: identical_row

      - specific_column_value_triggers_transformation
      - transformation_is_a_value_mapping_on_a_subsequence
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom.
    3.  For each row, examine the pixel value in the second column (index 1).
    4.  If the value in the second column is azure (8):
        a.  Copy the value from the first column (index 0) of the input row to the first column of the corresponding output row.
        b.  Set the value in the second column (index 1) of the output row to orange (7).
        c.  Set the value in the third column (index 2) of the output row to azure (8).
        d.  Set the value in the fourth column (index 3) of the output row to green (3).
    5.  If the value in the second column is *not* azure (8), copy the entire input row to the corresponding output row without any changes.
    6.  Return the completed output grid.

**Analysis of Example train_2**

*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids are both 6x6.
    *   The colors involved are white (0), gray (5), and orange (7).
    *   Comparing the input and output, rows 0, 2, and 4 are unchanged.
    *   Rows 1, 3, and 5 are identical in the input (`5 0 7 7 7 7`) and are transformed identically in the output (`7 5 0 7 7 7`).
    *   The transformation seems to depend on the content of the row. Rows starting `0 5 ...` are unchanged, while rows starting `5 0 ...` are changed.
    *   Specifically, if a row has gray (5) in the first column (index 0), then the sub-sequence from the first to the third column (indices 0, 1, 2) is transformed.
    *   The original sub-sequence `5 0 7` becomes `7 5 0`.
    *   This transformation can be described as a specific mapping applied to the values in these positions: the original value 5 becomes 7, the original value 0 becomes 5, and the original value 7 becomes 0. The remaining columns (indices 3, 4, 5) are unchanged.
