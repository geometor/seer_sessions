Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains objects of color '8' (light blue).

2.  **Locate Specific Positions:**
    *   Find the object in the second row and the first column occupied by the color '8'.
    *   Find the object in the fifth row and second to last column occupied by the color '8'.

3.  **Apply Transformation:**
    + Change pixel color to '1' (dark blue) to the right side of the object in the second row, and to the left side of the object in the fifth row.

**Step-by-step Description in other words:**

Looking at input we can see that there are light blue objects (number 8).
The program find the object in the second row. Then change the first '0' after the object to a '1'.
Also, it find an object in the fifth row, and changes the first '0' before the number '8' to '1'.
