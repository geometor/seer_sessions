Two horizontal 1x2 lines and two vertical 2x1 lines.\n      positions:\n        - [0,4], [0,5] # Horizontal line 1\n        - [1,5]       # segment of Horizontal line 1        \n        - [2,2], [3,2] # Vertical line 1\n        - [3,3]       # segment of Vertical Line 1\n        - [5,4]       # Vertical line 2\n        - [6,3], [6,4]       # Horizontal line 2\n\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      shape: background\n      position: everywhere else\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: 7x7\n  objects:\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      shape: Disconnected segments.  Two horizontal 1x2 lines and two vertical 2x1 lines.\n      positions:\n        - [0,4], [0,5] # Horizontal line 1\n        - [1,5]       # segment of Horizontal line 1\n        - [2,2], [3,2] # Vertical line 1\n        - [3,3]       # segment of Vertical Line 1        \n        - [5,4]       # Vertical line 2\n        - [6,3], [6,4]       # Horizontal line 2\n    - color: 1 (blue)\n      shape: Single pixel\n      positions:\n        - [1,4] # left of Horizontal line 1\n        - [2,3] # right of Vertical line 1\n        - [5,3] # left of the top of vertical line 2\n\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      shape: background\n      position: everywhere else\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Step-by-step transformation):**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:**  The input grid has azure (8) colored objects, and the white (0) background. The azure objects are disconnected segments.\n\n2.  **Detect Change:**  New blue (1) pixels appear in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Locate Blue Pixel Positions and Transformation Rule:**\n    *   A blue pixel is added to the *immediate left* of the *topmost* horizontal line of azure color.\n    *   A blue pixel is added to the *immediate right* of the *topmost* vertical line of azure color.\n    *   A blue pixel is added to the *immediate left* of the *top* of the next (or second to top if more than one at the same level) vertical line.\n    *  The azure (8) elements and the white (0) background remain unchanged.\n\nThe example shows that we have a more complex rule. We must consider a hierarchy among the lines. We look for horizontal and vertical lines, and then find the topmost line. It is not the bottommost, but the *topmost* horizontal and vertical lines of color 8.\nWhen we find a collision (more than one vertical segment starting on the same row) we choose the next highest vertical segment.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nTransformation Rule:\nThe azure (8) objects remain unchanged.\nA blue (1) pixel is added to the immediate left of the topmost horizontal azure line.\nA blue (1) pixel is added to the immediate right of the topmost vertical azure line.\nA blue (1) pixel is added to the immediate left of the top of the next vertical line.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_topmost_horizontal_line(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds the topmost horizontal line of a given color.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols - 1):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and grid[r, c+1] == color:\n                return r, c\n    return None\n\ndef find_topmost_vertical_lines(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds the topmost vertical lines of a given color, handling duplicates.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    vertical_lines = []\n    for c in range(cols):\n        for r in range(rows - 1):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and grid[r+1, c] == color:\n                vertical_lines.append((r, c))\n    # Sort by row and then by column to handle duplicates, returning distinct lines\n    vertical_lines = sorted(set(vertical_lines), key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n    return vertical_lines\n    \n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Find the topmost horizontal line of color 8\n    top_horizontal = find_topmost_horizontal_line(output_grid, 8)\n    if top_horizontal:\n        r, c = top_horizontal\n        # Add a blue pixel (1) to the left\n        if c > 0:\n            output_grid[r, c - 1] = 1\n\n    # Find the topmost vertical lines of color 8\n    top_verticals = find_topmost_vertical_lines(output_grid, 8)\n    if top_verticals:\n      if len(top_verticals) >= 1:\n        # Add a blue pixel (1) to the right of the first (topmost) line\n        r,c = top_verticals[0]\n        if c+1 < output_grid.shape[1]:\n          output_grid[r, c + 1] = 1\n      if len(top_verticals) >= 2:  #check there is enough vertical lines\n        # Add a blue pixel (1) to the left of the second (next topmost)\n        r,c = top_verticals[1]\n        if c > 0:\n          output_grid[r,c-1] = 1\n\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
