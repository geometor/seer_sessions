The azure objects appear as two disconnected 2x1 vertical lines and two 1x2 horizontal lines.\n\n2.  **Detect Change:** Comparing input to output, new blue (1) pixels appear.\n\n3.  **Locate Blue Pixel Positions:**\n    *   A blue pixel appears to the immediate right of the *topmost* vertical azure line. Specifically, it is at position [1,2].\n    *    A blue pixel appears to the immediate left of the *bottommost* horizontal azure line. Specifically, at [4,4].\n\n4. **Transformation Rule:** The overall transformation rule is:\n    * Find the topmost vertical line of color 8. Place color 1 to the immediate right of the top of that segment.\n    * Find the bottommost horizontal line of color 8. Place a color 1 to the immediate left of that segment.\n    *   The azure (8) elements and the white (0) background remain unchanged.\n\nIn simple terms. The azure objects remain where they are, but one blue pixel is added to the right of the highest vertical azure line, and another is added to the left of the lowest horizontal azure line.\n"
