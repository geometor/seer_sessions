            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformations in the provided examples.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:**\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 1 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 1 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   There are two azure (8) colored L-shaped objects, one in the top-left and one in the bottom-right.\n*   A blue (1) pixel appears to the right of the top-left azure object's vertical segment, and a blue (1) pixel appears to the left of the bottom-right object's vertical segment.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:**\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 1 8 0\n0 0 8 1 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 8 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0\n```\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   There are two azure (8) colored L-shaped objects. One in the top-right and one in the bottom-left and one in the center-left of the grid.\n*   A blue (1) pixel appears to the left of the top-right azure object's vertical segment, and, a blue (1) appears to the right of the center-left azure object. and a blue (1) pixel appears to the left of the bottom-left azure object.\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8) colored \"L\"-shaped objects within the input grid. These objects consist of three contiguous pixels forming an \"L\" shape. An \"L\" shape object consists of 3 adjacent cells of the same color where two cells form a vertical part and another cell connect with one extremity.\n\n2.  **Determine Insertion Point:** For each identified \"L\" shaped object:\n    *   Check if the \"L\" shape object opens to the right (like in example 1 top left corner or the second example, bottom left object). If this is the case, insert a blue (1) pixel immediately to the right of the vertical segment of the \"L\".\n    *   Check if the \"L\" shape opens to the left (like example 1, bottom right, or the example 2, top right). If this is the case, insert a blue (1) pixel immediately to the left of the vertical segment of the \"L\".\n\n3.  **Create Output:** Copy the input grid. Add the blue pixels based on step 2, resulting in the final output grid.\n\nIn summary, the transformation rule involves finding azure \"L\" shapes and strategically placing blue pixels adjacent to their vertical bars, depending on the corner where it is placed and based on whether they open to the left or to the right.\n"
