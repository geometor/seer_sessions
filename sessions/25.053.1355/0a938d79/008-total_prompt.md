"""
1.  **Identify Key Colors:** Examine the input grid. Identify "key colors" as any non-zero color.
2.  **Detect Horizontal Pattern**: Look for repeating patterns of colors and blank spaces horizontally.
3. **Detect Vertical Pattern:** If there is a consisten horizontal pattern, look for repeating pattern of colors and blank rows in a vertical stacking.
4.  **Build Output:**
    *   If a horizontal pattern is found, fill the output grid rows by repeating the pattern starting at the column of the first colored pixel, until the end of the row.
    * If a vertical pattern is found, use the horizontal pattern from the first set of colored rows. Repeat the combination of colored and blank rows, starting from the first colored row index.
5.  **Default:** If no key colors are found, return an output grid of the same size, filled with 0.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach focused on detecting horizontal and vertical patterns. While this works for some cases, it's clearly failing to capture the full logic of the transformations. The primary issue is that it's not correctly identifying and extending the repeating units. It assumes the pattern starts at the first colored pixel and only considers horizontal extension, or a stack of horizontal extensions. It is not correctly handling cases where the repeating unit is larger than a single colored pixel or a simple horizontal sequence. The code is also inserting only the first color it finds horizontally, rather than the full horizontal pattern. In Example 3 and 4, the stacking of the horizontal pattern, is repeating the first color, instead of the detected repeating color pattern.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Improved Pattern Detection:** Instead of just looking for the first colored pixel, the code needs to consider the possibility of multi-pixel patterns. It will need to find minimal repeating unit in the colored sequence, both horizontal and vertical.
2.  **Flexible Pattern Extension:** The pattern extension should consider repeating full unit and not just inserting a single color. The code needs to copy a sequence.
3. **Vertical Stacking:** Vertical stacking of a row pattern needs to repeat each row with all it's colors.

**Metrics and Observations (using hypothetical `code_execution`):**

I will describe what *would* be done with a `code_execution` module, as if I had it available, and produce an example of the expected results.

```python
# Hypothetical code execution - This would be done externally
results = []
for i, (input_grid, expected_output) in enumerate(zip(train_inputs, train_outputs)):
    transformed_output = transform(input_grid)
    match = np.array_equal(transformed_output, expected_output)
    pixels_off = np.sum(transformed_output != expected_output)
    size_correct = transformed_output.shape == expected_output.shape
    
    # Count matching pixels for each color
    unique_colors = np.unique(np.concatenate((expected_output, transformed_output)))
    correct_pixel_counts = {}
    for color in unique_colors:
        correct_pixel_counts[color] = np.sum((transformed_output == expected_output) & (expected_output == color))

    results.append({
        "example": i + 1,
        "match": match,
        "pixels_off": pixels_off,
        "size_correct": size_correct,
        "correct_pixel_counts": correct_pixel_counts
    })

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

**Example Output (as if from `code_execution`):**

(This mirrors the provided text output, but in a structured format as if it were generated by code.)

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Rows:** Find rows that contain non-zero (colored) pixels.
2.  **Horizontal Pattern Detection:** For each colored row:
    *   Find the shortest repeating horizontal pattern of colors, including intervening zeros. Consider the entire row when looking for the pattern - if the pattern repeats, it must fill the entire row.
3.  **Vertical Pattern Detection:** If there are multiple colored rows, OR colored rows mixed with all-zero rows:
    * Find the shortest sequence of entire rows that repeat. This sequence becomes the vertical stacking pattern.
4. **Build Output:**
    * Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input.
    *   If a vertical stacking pattern is found, repeat this sequence of rows to fill the output grid, starting with the top row.
    * If no colored row is found, return the empty grid.

This revised natural language program is significantly improved because it correctly identifies repeating sequences, handles the mix of 0 and colored rows in finding a vertical stacking pattern, and fills out the entire output grid based on repeating units.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
