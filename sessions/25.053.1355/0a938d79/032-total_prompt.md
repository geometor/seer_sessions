"""
1.  **Iterate through each row of the input grid.**
2.  **Identify background rows:** If a row contains only the color black (0), keep it as is in the output grid.
3.  **Identify repeating fill rows:** If a row contains one color and black(0), fill the whole line with the non-zero color.
4.  **Identify alternating fill rows.** If a row contains multiple non-black(0) colors and black(0), create a repeating sequence of non-zero color values to fill the whole line, preserving the order of appearance.
5.  **Vertical Repetition**: Repeat the fill rows vertically, starting from the first filled row and wrapping around if reaching the last row.
6.  **Output Size**: The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.

Here's an analysis of the provided examples and a revised natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code have several shortcomings. The primary issue is that the vertical repetition logic is flawed. It attempts to repeat *all* filled rows cyclically, but it doesn't correctly handle cases where there are multiple filled rows or "alternating_fill" rows. The code also does not correctly predict the interleaving of colors seen in example 2. The key insight from examining the failures is that the vertical repetition must be based on individual *non-black* rows and consider the pattern *within* those rows, not just a global repetition.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Row Classification:** The `get_row_type` function is generally sound, but the vertical repetition needs to consider non-black and non-all-black rows.
2.  **Improve Vertical Repetition:** Instead of tracking all filled rows and repeating them, the program should identify rows to repeat. If a row has a single non-zero color, it fills that row and repeats. If a row has more than one color, it extends this row according to its internal pattern.
3. **Handle Interleaving**: Pay attention to how multiple colors are interleaved.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, analyzing discrepancies:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   The original logic incorrectly fills the entire rows with a single color.
    *   The expected output shows an alternating pattern of colors 2 and 8, where the input had black(0), 2, and 8 values.
    *   The fill should account for the non-black colors alternating.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Similar to example 1, the logic fails to alternate the two colors.
    *   The code fills entire lines with either color 1 or color 3 instead of an interleaved 1,3,1,3 pattern.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   The repetition logic is incorrect. Vertical fill should repeat with the alternating pattern.
*   **Example 4:**
    *   The repetition should continue vertically.

      transformations:
        - fill_rows: [Rows with 0 and other colors, fill entire row with the non-zero color]
        - alternate_rows: [Filled rows with different values alternate through the whole output grid]
  - example_4:
      input_objects:
        - row_8: [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - row_12: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
      output_objects:
        - row_8,15,23: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
        - row_12, 19: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
      transformations:
       - fill_rows: [Rows with 0 and a single other color fill the entire row with that color]
       - alternate_rows: [Filled rows alternate through the whole output grid]
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine Each Row:** Iterate through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Identify Background Rows:** If a row contains *only* black (0), it remains unchanged in the output.
3.  **Identify and Process Non-Background Rows:**
    *   If a row contains black (0) and one or more other colors, extend the row by repeating the sequence of non-zero colors horizontally across the whole row.
4.  **Vertical Pattern Application:** The first processed row is copied to the output. Subsequent processed rows alternate with any previously identified processed rows, cycling through the available fill colors for the entire height of the output grid.

Essentially, the logic identifies rows that define a pattern (either a single color fill or an alternating pattern). It uses *these* rows as the basis for filling the entire output grid vertically, repeating or alternating the fill patterns as needed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
