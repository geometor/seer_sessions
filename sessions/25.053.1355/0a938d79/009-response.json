Both grids consist of cells containing numerical values, which can be interpreted as colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and green (3). The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid, with a specific pattern applied. The input has single instances of blue and green, while the output shows horizontal and vertical sequences of blue and green.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
