The input grid appears sparse, with mostly 'white' (0) pixels and a few isolated 'red' (2) and 'azure' (8) pixels. The output grid is dense, filling every cell. The output grid's pattern seems derived from the positions of the initial 'red' and 'azure' pixels in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Skip a column.\n\n3. **Alternating Azure:** from left, create columns in the previously skipped column positions using the detected azure value.\n\n4.  **Fill Output:** Repeat the alternating pattern of color columns filling the output grid, ensuring it has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n"
