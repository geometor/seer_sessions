            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and a revised natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and code correctly identified the concept of \"seed rows\" and using the colors from those rows to fill the output. However, it failed in several key aspects:\n\n1.  **Horizontal Stripe Expansion:** The original program only placed single pixels in each output row. The examples clearly demonstrate that the intent is to create full-width horizontal stripes of the chosen color.  It is not placing isolated pixels, but entire rows.\n2.  **Alternating Colors and Column order:** The examples show an alternating and repeating fill, based on color. Example 1, alternates the two seed rows. Example 2 alternates the colors from the two seed row, so the output alternates blue, green. Examples 3 and 4 extend this to an arbitrary number of seed rows.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Fill Entire Rows:** Modify the code to fill the entire row with the selected color, instead of placing a single pixel.\n2. **Seed Rows as Objects:** Consider the non-white pixels as objects. Identify them and note their position.\n3. **Complete Output:** construct an output the same size as the input, fill all white initially, then perform the transformation.\n\n**Example Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary of observations and metrics for each example:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Seed Rows | Seed Colors | Seed Cols | Notes                                                            |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :-------- | :---------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | (10, 25)    | (10, 25)     | 2         | red, azure   | 5, 7      | Alternating red/azure stripes, full row, starting at col 5 and 7. |\n| 2       | (7, 23)     | (7, 23)      | 2         | blue, green  | 5, 8      | Alternating blue/green stripes, full width.                   |\n| 3       | (22, 9)     | (22, 9)      | 2        | red, green       | 0, 8        |    Alternating red/green stripes, full width, some blank rows                                                      |\n| 4       | (24, 8)     | (24, 8)       | 2       | yellow, blue           | 0, 0         |     Alternating yellow, blue stripes, full width                                                     |\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - type: grid\n    properties:\n      shape: variable\n      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n\n  - type: seed_row\n    properties:\n      color: integer (0-9, non-zero)\n      column: integer (index of the first non-zero pixel)\n\nactions:\n  - name: identify_seed_rows\n    description: Locate rows with at least one non-white pixel.\n\n  - name: create_horizontal_stripes\n    description: Fill each row of the output grid with a single color, creating full-width stripes.\n\n  - name: alternate_colors\n    description:  Cycle through the seed row colors, assigning each to a successive output row.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Seed Rows:** Examine each row of the input grid. A row is a \"seed row\" if it contains at least one non-white (non-zero) pixel.\n2.  **Record Seed Row Information:** For each seed row, store:\n    *   The color of the first non-white pixel.\n    *   The column index of that first non-white pixel.\n    *   The seed rows should be recorded in the order in which they appear in the input.\n3. **Initialize output:** create an output grid of matching size, filled with white.\n4.  **Create Horizontal Stripes:** Iterate through the rows of the *output* grid. For each row:\n    *   Determine the color to use by cycling through the colors of the seed rows, in order.  (e.g., If the seed row colors are red, blue, green, the output rows will be filled red, blue, green, red, blue, green, etc.)\n    *   Fill the *entire* output row with the selected color.\n5. **Output complete:** the output is a grid, with each row completely filled with the color of the seed row.\n\n"
