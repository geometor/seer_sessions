The input grid appears to contain three distinct regions: a large area of azure (8) and white (0) pixels, seemingly random, in the top section; a horizontal band of all white (0) pixels in the middle; and a bottom section containing a mix of red (2) and white (0) pixels, where the red pixels form a somewhat contiguous shape. The output grid is a smaller, cropped section that corresponds to the lower-left portion of the red (2) and white(0) region of the input, specifically the part within the large red shape.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
