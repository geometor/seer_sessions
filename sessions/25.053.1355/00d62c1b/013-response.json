            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a revised natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code correctly identify the core concept: changing the *interior* green pixels to yellow. However, the `find_perimeter` function has a flaw. It incorrectly identifies perimeter pixels. It considers a pixel to be on the perimeter if *any* neighbor is a different color, even diagonally. This leads to an underestimation of the perimeter, and consequently, more green pixels are changed to yellow than expected. The strategy to resolve this is to refine the perimeter definition to include only directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) neighbors, not diagonal ones.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including an assessment of why the transformation failed:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The perimeter is missing two pixels: `(2,2)` and `(3,3)` are not considered on the perimeter (diagonal issue).\n*   **Example 2:** The perimeter is missing one pixels: `(4,6)` is not considered on the perimeter (diagonal issue).\n*   **Example 3:** The perimeter incorrectly includes pixels - most of the pixels are not on the perimeter.\n*   **Example 4:**  The perimeter is missing multiple pixels, especially in areas like `(2,2), (2,3), (3,2)` and `(7,8), (8,7)`. (diagonal issue).\n*   **Example 5:** Many interior pixels are incorrectly identified as not on the perimeter due to the diagonal adjacency issue.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: 012\nobjects:\n  - id: shape_1\n    type: contiguous_block\n    color: green\n    initial_state:  # Description of the green shape in the input\n      - \"Varies in shape and size across examples.\"\n    transformed_state: # Description of the shape in the output\n      - \"Perimeter remains green; interior pixels change to yellow.\"\nactions:\n  - name: identify_perimeter\n    description: \"Find the set of pixels on the outer edge of the green shape, considering only up, down, left, and right neighbors.\"\n    input: shape_1\n    output: perimeter_pixels\n  - name: change_interior_color\n    description: \"Change the color of all green pixels within the shape that are NOT part of the perimeter to yellow.\"\n    input:\n      - shape_1\n      - perimeter_pixels\n    output: shape_1.transformed_state\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Green Shape:** Locate all contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels within the input grid. Combine these into a single green shape.\n2.  **Identify the True Perimeter:** Iterate through all pixels within the green shape. A pixel is part of the perimeter if it meets *either* of these conditions:\n    *   It is on the edge of the entire grid (top row, bottom row, leftmost column, or rightmost column).\n    *   It has at least one direct neighbor (up, down, left, or right \u2013 *not* diagonal) that is *not* part of the green shape.\n3.  **Modify Interior Pixels:** Iterate through all pixels of the green shape. If a pixel is *not* in the perimeter set, change its color to yellow (4).\n4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** Ensure all other pixels in the grid retain their original colors. The output grid must be the same size as the input grid. The final output grid represents the modified input.\n"
