The primary colors observed are white (0) and green (3). There's a transformation occurring where some green (3) pixels are changed to yellow (4) pixels. The transformation seems localized and specific, affecting only certain green pixels. The shapes, sizes, and overall layout of the white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
