"""
1.  **Identify the Largest Object:** Find the largest contiguous block of green (3) pixels in the input grid. This is the target object.

2.  **Determine Interior Pixels:** Accurately identify the *interior* pixels of the target object. A pixel is considered inside if it's part of the largest green object and is completely surrounded by other green pixels of that *same* object, such that it cannot be reached from the background without crossing a green pixel of the target object. A simple neighbor check is insufficient; a flood-fill or similar approach from the outside edge of the grid is needed to ensure accurate identification of enclosed regions.

3.  **Change Interior Color:** Change the color of all identified *interior* pixels of the target object from green (3) to yellow (4).

4. **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid that are not part of the target object's interior remain unchanged.

Here's an analysis of the results and an updated natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The primary issue is the accurate identification of "interior" pixels. The current implementation's `find_interior_pixels` function, while using flood fill, doesn't correctly isolate the true interior pixels in all cases. It appears to be overly aggressive in identifying interior pixels, especially in cases with complex shapes or concavities. The core problem is that after the flood fill, the remaining temporary object color pixels aren't necessarily *interior*.  Pixels that are *adjacent* to the background, but on a diagonal, get marked as interior.

The strategy to resolve this is to refine the interior pixel detection. A better approach is to:

1.  **Expand the Object:**  Temporarily expand the object by one layer in all directions (including diagonals).
2.  **Flood Fill Background:** Flood-fill the background on this *expanded* grid.
3.  **Identify Interior (Original Object):** The "interior" pixels of the *original* object are those that were *not* reached by the flood fill on the *expanded* grid. This guarantees that only truly enclosed pixels are marked.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, noting key observations:

*   **Example 1:** The code incorrectly identifies the top-center green pixel as interior.
*   **Example 2:** Similar to Example 1, the code is too aggressive in marking interior pixels. It includes pixels along concavities.
*   **Example 3:**  The code identifies some of the correct interior pixels, but misses many and also adds incorrect ones.  The concavity is a major source of error.
*   **Example 4:**  Shows significant over-identification of interior pixels due to the diagonal adjacency problem described in the "General Assessment".
*   **Example 5:** The largest and most complex example, highlighting the cumulative effect of the errors in interior pixel identification. Many exterior pixels are changed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
task_id: "020"
objects:
  - color: green (3)
    property: target_object
    selection_criteria: largest contiguous region
  - color: yellow (4)
    property: interior_fill
    relationship: fills interior of target_object
actions:
  - name: identify_largest_object
    input: green pixels
    output: coordinates of the largest green object
  - name: identify_interior_pixels
    input: largest green object coordinates, original grid
    output: coordinates of interior pixels within the largest green object
  - name: change_color
    input: interior pixels, original grid
    output: modified grid with interior pixels changed to yellow
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Largest Green Object:** Identify the largest contiguous region of green (3) pixels in the input grid. This is the "target object."

2.  **Expand the Object:** Create a temporary copy of the grid. Expand the target object in this copy by one pixel in all directions (horizontally, vertically, and *diagonally*).  This creates an "expanded object."

3.  **Flood Fill Background (Expanded Grid):**  On the *expanded* grid, flood-fill the background, starting from a known background pixel (e.g., the top-left corner).  Use a temporary color different from green and yellow.

4.  **Identify Interior Pixels:**  Compare the original grid to the expanded, flood-filled grid. The interior pixels of the target object are those pixels that are:
    *   Green (3) in the *original* grid.
    *   *Not* the background color (after flood fill) in the *expanded* grid.

5.  **Change Interior Color:** Change the color of all identified interior pixels in the *original* grid from green (3) to yellow (4).

6. **Preserve all other pixels:** All other pixels remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
