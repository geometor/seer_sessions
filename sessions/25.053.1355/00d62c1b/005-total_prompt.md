Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Crosses:** Locate "cross-shaped" objects within the input grid. These are contiguous regions of green (3) pixels. A cross-shape must have at least one green pixel with green neighbors above and below, or to the left and right, or both.

2.  **Identify Interior Pixels:** Within each cross, identify "interior" green pixels. A green pixel is considered "interior" if it has at least two green neighbors *in opposing directions*. This means:
    *   A green neighbor above AND a green neighbor below.
    *   OR, a green neighbor to the left AND a green neighbor to the right.
    *   OR, Both of the above conditions are met.

3.  **Transform Interior Pixels:** Change the color of all identified interior green pixels to yellow (4).

4. **Leave Other Pixels Unchanged**: All pixels not meeting the above conditions are unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
