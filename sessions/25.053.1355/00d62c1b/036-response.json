These regions constitute the \"green shapes.\"\n\n2.  **Define Interior:** Within each green shape, define \"interior\" pixels as those green pixels that are completely surrounded by either other green pixels or yellow pixels that have already been filled. Consider that at the start all other green cells count as surrounding.\n\n3.  **Iterative Interior Filling:** Iteratively fill the interior of each green shape with yellow (4). Start from the green pixels that do not have white neighbours and are fully surround by green. This process should be repeated until no more green pixels within a shape meet the \"interior\" criteria.\n\n4.  **Preserve Background:**  All pixels that are not part of a green shape's interior should remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_contiguous_regions(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds all contiguous regions of a given color in the grid.\"\"\"\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    regions = []\n\n    def dfs(row, col, current_region):\n        \"\"\"Depth-first search to find contiguous pixels.\"\"\"\n        if (\n            row < 0\n            or row >= grid.shape[0]\n            or col < 0\n            or col >= grid.shape[1]\n            or visited[row, col]\n            or grid[row, col] != color\n        ):\n            return\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        current_region.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, current_region)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, current_region)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, current_region)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, current_region)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[row, col] == color and not visited[row, col]:\n                current_region = []\n                dfs(row, col, current_region)\n                regions.append(current_region)\n    return regions\n\ndef is_interior(grid, row, col, filled):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a green pixel is an interior pixel.\"\"\"\n    if grid[row,col] != 3:\n        return False\n\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue\n            nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n            if (\n                0 <= nr < grid.shape[0]\n                and 0 <= nc < grid.shape[1]\n                and grid[nr, nc] != 3\n                and (nr,nc) not in filled\n                and grid[nr,nc] != 4\n            ):\n                return False  # Found a neighbor that is not green or yellow (filled)\n    return True\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid by filling the interior of green shapes with yellow.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = input_grid.copy()\n    green_regions = find_contiguous_regions(input_grid, 3)  # Find green shapes\n    filled = set()\n\n    for region in green_regions:\n        changed = True\n        while changed:  # Iterate until no more interior pixels are found\n            changed = False\n            pixels_to_fill = []\n\n            for row, col in region:\n                if (row, col) not in filled and is_interior(output_grid, row, col, filled):\n                    pixels_to_fill.append((row, col))\n\n            for row, col in pixels_to_fill:\n                output_grid[row, col] = 4  # Fill with yellow\n                filled.add((row,col))\n                changed = True\n\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
