Two green pixels are connected if you can move between them by going up, down, left, or right without encountering a non-green pixel. Each of these groups is a \"connected component.\"\n\n2.  **Define Interior Pixels:** A green pixel within a connected component is considered \"interior\" if it meets *all* of the following conditions:\n    *   It has a green neighbor above it.\n    *   It has a green neighbor below it.\n    *   It has a green neighbor to its left.\n    *   It has a green neighbor to its right.\n\n3.  **Transform Interior Pixels:** Change the color of all identified \"interior\" green pixels to yellow (4).\n\n4.  **Leave Other Pixels Unchanged:** All other pixels that are not \"interior\" green pixels within a connected component remain their original color.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule.\"\"\"\n\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    def is_interior(i, j):\n        \"\"\"Checks if a green pixel is interior to a connected component.\"\"\"\n        if input_grid[i, j] != 3:\n            return False\n\n        up = i > 0 and input_grid[i-1, j] == 3\n        down = i < rows - 1 and input_grid[i+1, j] == 3\n        left = j > 0 and input_grid[i, j-1] == 3\n        right = j < cols - 1 and input_grid[i, j+1] == 3\n\n        return up and down and left and right # All four neighbors must be green\n\n    # Iterate through each cell of the grid.\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check if the current cell is an interior green pixel.\n            if is_interior(i, j):\n                # Change the color of the current cell to yellow (4).\n                output_grid[i, j] = 4\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
