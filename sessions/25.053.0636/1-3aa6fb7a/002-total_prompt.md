Okay, I will analyze the provided input and output grids to determine the transformation rule. Here's my approach:

**1. Observe and gather facts:**

I'll start by visually inspecting the input and output grids, noting the objects, their positions, colors, and any changes. I will document these observations in a YAML block.

**2. Identify patterns and relationships:**

I will look for patterns in how objects are arranged and how they change between the input and output. I'll pay attention to:

*   **Object persistence:** Do objects remain the same, change color, or disappear?
*   **Spatial relationships:** How are objects positioned relative to each other?
*   **Color changes:** Are there any consistent color transformations?
*  **Movement:** Do object move and what constraints are followed?

**3. Formulate a natural language program:**

Based on my observations, I will create a step-by-step description of the transformation process in natural language. This will describe the rule that converts the input to the output.

**4. Consider edge cases**

Think about how the natural language program applies if there are no object, multiple objects, and different colors.

Here's the YAML block with my initial observations:


```yaml
observations:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: [7, 7]
      objects:
        - color: azure (8)
          shape: appears to be two separate lines, potentially considered as distinct objects.
          positions:
            - line 1: [(1,1), (2,1)]
            - line 2: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]

  - output_grid:
      dimensions: [7, 7]
      objects:
        - color: azure (8)
          shape: same as input
          positions:
            - line 1: [(1,1), (2,1)]
            - line 2: [(3,4), (4,5), (3,5)]
        - color: blue (1)
          shape: single pixel
          positions:
            - [(1,2), (4,4)] # one in between each of the azure lines
  - changes:
      - type: color addition
        details: Single blue (1) pixels appear in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8) colored lines in the input grid.
2.  **Insert Blue Pixel:** For each line segment, add a blue (1) pixel to the right of the top-most, left-most pixel. If a segment is vertical, insert the blue to the right of the top pixel. If horizontal, insert beside the left-most.

I have edited the natural language program to be as succinct as I could manage.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
