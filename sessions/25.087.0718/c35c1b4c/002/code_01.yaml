observations:
  - task: General transformation involves modifying pixels near the largest contiguous non-background object.
  - object_finding:
      - definition: Contiguous block of same non-background color.
      - connectivity: 8-way (based on initial analysis yielding consistent largest object).
      - background: Color 0 (white) is ignored when finding objects.
  - target_object:
      - criteria: The object with the largest pixel count. Tie-breaking rules are unknown but not needed for these examples.
      - color: Let the color of the largest object be C.
  - transformation:
      - pixels_affected: A subset of pixels P adjacent (8-way) to the target object S.
          - Exception: Example 2 shows some affected pixels not adjacent to the original object S, which requires further investigation (potential iteration?).
      - original_color: Affected pixels P can have various original colors, including background (0) and other non-background colors.
      - resulting_color: All affected pixels P change their color to C.
  - selection_criterion (Problem): The specific rule determining *which* adjacent pixels (and potentially non-adjacent ones in Ex2) belong to the subset P is unclear. Simple rules tested (all neighbours, only background neighbours, neighbours with >=k target neighbours, 2x2 completion) do not consistently explain the examples.
  - comparison_with_previous_code: The previous code correctly identified the largest object C but incorrectly changed *all* adjacent non-C pixels, rather than the specific subset P seen in the expected outputs.
