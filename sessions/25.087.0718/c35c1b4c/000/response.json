The grids contain pixels of different colors.\n\nComparing the input and output grids in each example, I observe the following:\n1.  **Structure Preservation:** Much of the grid structure and colors remain the same between input and output.\n2.  **Color Spreading:** In each example, one specific color seems to \"spread\" or \"grow\" into adjacent cells.\n    *   In `train_1`, the blue (1) pixels expand into neighboring cells.\n    *   In `train_2`, the green (3) pixels expand into neighboring cells.\n    *   In `train_3`, the red (2) pixels expand into neighboring cells.\n3.  **Target Color:** The color that spreads appears to be the color of the largest contiguous block of non-background (non-white/0) pixels in the input grid.\n4.  **Expansion Rule:** The expansion happens to all cells that are directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a pixel of the target color in the input grid. These adjacent cells take on the target color in the output grid, regardless of their original color.\n5.  **Original Object:** Pixels that were already the target color remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all contiguous regions (objects) of pixels having the same non-white color in the input grid. Consider pixels connected horizontally, vertically, and diagonally as part of the same object.\n3.  Determine the object with the largest area (most pixels). Let its color be `target_color`.\n4.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` in the input grid.\n5.  For each pixel `(r, c)`, examine its eight neighbours (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).\n6.  If the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid does *not* have the `target_color`, *and* at least one of its neighbours in the input grid *does* have the `target_color`, then change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to `target_color`.\n7.
