task_description: Expand the largest contiguous object by one pixel layer in all directions.
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - contains pixels of different colors (0-9)
      - size varies (up to 30x30)
  - type: object
    properties:
      - contiguous block of pixels of the same color
      - connectivity includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacency
      - excludes background color (white/0)
  - type: target_object
    properties:
      - the object with the largest number of pixels in the input grid
      - has a specific color (target_color)
actions:
  - identify_objects: Find all contiguous non-background objects in the input grid.
  - find_largest_object: Determine the object with the maximum number of pixels.
  - identify_target_color: Get the color of the largest object.
  - identify_expansion_pixels: Find all pixels in the input grid that are adjacent (including diagonals) to any pixel of the target_object.
  - modify_grid: Create the output grid by changing the color of the expansion_pixels to the target_color. All other pixels retain their original input color.
relationships:
  - adjacency: Pixels are adjacent if they touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  - expansion: The target_object expands into adjacent pixels.
