"""
Identify the largest contiguous region (object) of non-background (non-0) pixels using 8-way connectivity. Let its color be C.
Iterate through all 2x2 squares in the input grid. If exactly three of the four pixels in a 2x2 square have the color C in the input grid, change the color of the fourth pixel (which does not have color C) to C in the output grid. This process occurs based on the state of the input grid, meaning all 2x2 squares are evaluated based on the original pixel colors before modifications are made.
