The only other non-white color present is Azure (8).\n    *   In Example 2, Blue (1) changes to Magenta (6). The other non-white colors present are Magenta (6), Orange (7), and Maroon (9). Magenta (6) has the lowest numerical index among these.\n    *   In Example 3, Blue (1) pixels change to Green (3), Orange (7), or Maroon (9). The other non-white colors present are Green (3), Magenta (6), Orange (7), and Maroon (9). Green (3) has the lowest numerical index among these. However, the output shows Blue pixels changing to multiple different colors (3, 7, 9), not just the minimum (3). This contradicts the simple \"change to minimum present color\" rule observed in Examples 1 and 2.\n\n*   **Refined Perception & Hypothesis:** Given the contradiction in Example 3, let's reconsider. The simplest consistent rule covering Examples 1 and 2 is: Find all non-white (0), non-Blue (1) colors present. If any exist, find the one with the minimum color index. Change all Blue (1) pixels to this minimum color index. Example 3 might represent a more complex rule or potentially an outlier that doesn't fit the primary pattern. *Assuming the core task intends the simpler pattern from Ex 1 & 2 for generalization*, I will proceed with that hypothesis.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
