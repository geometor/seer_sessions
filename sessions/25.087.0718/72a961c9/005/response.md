Transformation Rule:
1. Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2. Locate the single horizontal row (`r_line`) in the input grid that contains non-white (non-zero) pixels.
3. Scan the horizontal line: Iterate through each column index (`c`) of the row `r_line` in the input grid.
4. Identify trigger pixels: Check the color of the pixel at `input_grid[r_line, c]`.
   - If the color is red (2), set the target segment height `h = 4`.
   - If the color is azure (8), set the target segment height `h = 3`.
   - Otherwise, set `h = 0` (no segment will be drawn).
5. Draw the vertical segment if triggered (if `h > 0`):
   a. Determine the color of the trigger pixel (`trigger_color = input_grid[r_line, c]`).
   b. Calculate the topmost row index for the segment: `r_top = r_line - h`.
   c. Place the top pixel: If `r_top` is within the grid's top boundary (`r_top >= 0`), set the pixel at `output_grid[r_top, c]` to `trigger_color`.
   d. Fill the remaining segment positions below the top pixel with blue (1): Iterate for `k` from 1 up to `h - 1`.
      i. Calculate the target row index: `r_target = r_top + k`.
      ii. If `r_target` is within the grid's top boundary (`r_target >= 0`), set the pixel at `output_grid[r_target, c]` to blue (1).
6. Return the modified output grid.
