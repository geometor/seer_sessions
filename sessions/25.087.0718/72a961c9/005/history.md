Transformation Rule:
1. Find the single horizontal line containing non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid. Let its row index be `r_line`.
2. Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
3. Iterate through each column `c` of the horizontal line in the input grid.
4. Identify the trigger pixel color at `input_grid[r_line, c]`:
   - If the color is red (2), define a target height `h = 4`.
   - If the color is azure (8), define a target height `h = 3`.
   - Otherwise, the pixel is not a trigger, and no vertical line is drawn from this column.
5. If a trigger color is found (i.e., `h > 0`):
   a. Iterate through steps `k` from `0` to `h - 1`.
   b. Calculate the source column index `c_source = c + k`. This indicates the column in the original line from which to fetch the color.
   c. Calculate the target row index `r_target = r_line - h + k`. This determines the vertical position in the output column `c` where the color will be placed. The pixel from `k=0` goes to the top `(r_line - h)`, and the pixel from `k=h-1` goes just above the line `(r_line - 1)`.
   d. Check if the calculated indices `r_target` and `c_source` are within the grid boundaries (`r_target >= 0` and `c_source < grid_width`).
   e. If the indices are valid, get the color from `input_grid[r_line, c_source]` and place it at `output_grid[r_target, c]`.
6. Return the modified output grid.

The code execution confirms the revised hypothesis. The vertical lines are formed by placing the trigger color at the top and filling the rest with blue (1).

**Final Plan:**
1.  Update the facts (YAML).
2.  Rewrite the natural language program based on the confirmed hypothesis.## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code successfully implemented a transformation rule based on the first example, correctly handling the basic mechanism of identifying trigger pixels (red and azure) in a horizontal line and drawing vertical segments above them. However, testing against further examples, specifically Example 4, revealed that the logic for determining the *colors* used within the vertical segments was incorrect.

The failure in Example 4, where the generated output differed from the expected output in columns triggered by azure (col 5) and red (col 7), indicates the initial assumption about sourcing colors sequentially from the horizontal line was flawed.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Discrepancy:** Compare the input, expected output, and generated output for Example 4 to pinpoint the exact differences.
2.  **Revise Hypothesis:** Formulate a new hypothesis about how the colors in the vertical segments are determined, ensuring it is consistent with *all* training examples. The key insight came from observing that the expected output for Example 4 used blue pixels (1) extensively in the vertical segments, regardless of the subsequent colors in the original horizontal line.
3.  **Verify Hypothesis:** Test the revised hypothesis against all training examples, including using code execution to systematically check the pixel values in the relevant columns of Example 4's expected output.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect the corrected understanding of the transformation rule.

## Metrics and Analysis

Metrics were gathered specifically for Example 4, which caused the failure, to verify the revised hypothesis.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  **Locate Line:** Find the single horizontal row (`r_line`) in the input grid that contains non-white (non-zero) pixels.
3.  **Scan Line:** Iterate through each column index (`c`) of the horizontal line (`r_line`) in the input grid.
4.  **Identify Triggers:** Check the color of the pixel at `input_grid[r_line, c]`.
    *   If the color is red (2), set the target segment height `h = 4`.
    *   If the color is azure (8), set the target segment height `h = 3`.
    *   If the color is neither red nor azure, set `h = 0`.
5.  **Draw Segment (if triggered):** If `h > 0`:
    a.  **Place Top Pixel:** Calculate the topmost row index `r_top = r_line - h`. If `r_top` is within the grid boundaries (i.e., `r_top >= 0`), set the pixel at `output_grid[r_top, c]` to the trigger color found in step 4 (`input_grid[r_line, c]`).
    b.  **Fill Below with Blue:** Iterate for `k` from 1 up to `h - 1`.
        i.  Calculate the target row index `r_target = r_line - h + k`.
        ii. If `r_target` is within the grid boundaries (i.e., `r_target >= 0`), set the pixel at `output_grid[r_target, c]` to blue (1).
6.  **Return:** Output the modified grid.
