Transformation Rule:
1. Find the single horizontal line containing non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid. Let its row index be `r_line`.
2. Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
3. Iterate through each column `c` of the horizontal line in the input grid.
4. Identify the trigger pixel color at `input_grid[r_line, c]`:
   - If the color is red (2), define a target height `h = 4`.
   - If the color is azure (8), define a target height `h = 3`.
   - Otherwise, the pixel is not a trigger, and no vertical line is drawn from this column.
5. If a trigger color is found (i.e., `h > 0`):
   a. Iterate through steps `k` from `0` to `h - 1`.
   b. Calculate the source column index `c_source = c + k`. This indicates the column in the original line from which to fetch the color.
   c. Calculate the target row index `r_target = r_line - h + k`. This determines the vertical position in the output column `c` where the color will be placed. The pixel from `k=0` goes to the top `(r_line - h)`, and the pixel from `k=h-1` goes just above the line `(r_line - 1)`.
   d. Check if the calculated indices `r_target` and `c_source` are within the grid boundaries (`r_target >= 0` and `c_source < grid_width`).
   e. If the indices are valid, get the color from `input_grid[r_line, c_source]` and place it at `output_grid[r_target, c]`.
6. Return the modified output grid.
