observations:
  - data_structure:
      type: grid
      format: 2d_array
      pixels: integer_color_codes (0-9)
      background: white (0)
  - input_features:
      - single_horizontal_line:
          description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.
          location: Varies vertically, but only one such line exists per grid.
          content: Contains various colors, including potential trigger colors.
      - trigger_pixels:
          description: Specific colors within the horizontal line that initiate an action.
          colors:
            - red (2)
            - azure (8)
          location: Found at specific column indices (c) within the horizontal line row (r_line).
  - output_features:
      - base_grid: The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid.
      - vertical_segments:
          description: Columns of pixels drawn *above* the location of trigger pixels in the input line.
          location: In the same column (c) as the trigger pixel.
          height: Determined by the trigger pixel color.
          colors: Determined by a specific rule involving the trigger color and blue (1).
actions:
  - identify:
      target: horizontal_line
      result: row_index (r_line)
  - iterate:
      target: columns (c) of the horizontal_line (r_line) in the input grid
  - identify:
      target: pixel_color at input[r_line, c]
      condition: Check if the color is red (2) or azure (8).
  - determine_height:
      input: trigger_pixel_color
      rules:
        - if red (2): height (h) = 4
        - if azure (8): height (h) = 3
        - otherwise: h = 0 (no action)
  - construct_vertical_segment:
      condition: height (h) > 0
      location: column (c) of the output grid
      vertical_range: from row (r_line - h) up to (r_line - 1)
      pixel_placement:
        - topmost_pixel:
            location: (r_line - h, c)
            color: trigger_pixel_color (input[r_line, c])
        - remaining_pixels:
            location: (r, c) for r from (r_line - h + 1) to (r_line - 1)
            color: blue (1)
      boundary_conditions: Ensure target row indices (r) are non-negative (>= 0). Pixels outside the grid boundaries are not drawn.
