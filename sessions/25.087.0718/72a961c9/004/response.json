The vertical lines are formed by placing the trigger color at the top and filling the rest with blue (1).\n\n**Final Plan:**\n1.  Update the facts (YAML).\n2.  Rewrite the natural language program based on the confirmed hypothesis.## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code successfully implemented a transformation rule based on the first example, correctly handling the basic mechanism of identifying trigger pixels (red and azure) in a horizontal line and drawing vertical segments above them. However, testing against further examples, specifically Example 4, revealed that the logic for determining the *colors* used within the vertical segments was incorrect.\n\nThe failure in Example 4, where the generated output differed from the expected output in columns triggered by azure (col 5) and red (col 7), indicates the initial assumption about sourcing colors sequentially from the horizontal line was flawed.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Discrepancy:** Compare the input, expected output, and generated output for Example 4 to pinpoint the exact differences.\n2.  **Revise Hypothesis:** Formulate a new hypothesis about how the colors in the vertical segments are determined, ensuring it is consistent with *all* training examples. The key insight came from observing that the expected output for Example 4 used blue pixels (1) extensively in the vertical segments, regardless of the subsequent colors in the original horizontal line.\n3.  **Verify Hypothesis:** Test the revised hypothesis against all training examples, including using code execution to systematically check the pixel values in the relevant columns of Example 4's expected output.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect the corrected understanding of the transformation rule.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nMetrics were gathered specifically for Example 4, which caused the failure, to verify the revised hypothesis.\n"
