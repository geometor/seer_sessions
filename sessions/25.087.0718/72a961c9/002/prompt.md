Transformation Rule:
1. Find the single horizontal line containing non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid. Let its row index be `r_line`.
2. Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
3. Iterate through each column `c` of the horizontal line in the input grid.
4. If the pixel at `(r_line, c)` is red (2):
   a. Define a target height `h = 4`.
   b. For each step `k` from 0 to `h-1`:
      i. Calculate the source column `c_source = c + k`.
      ii. Calculate the target row `r_target = r_line - 1 - k`.
      iii. If `r_target` is within the grid's top boundary (>= 0) and `c_source` is within the grid's right boundary (< width), copy the color from `input_grid[r_line, c_source]` to `output_grid[r_target, c]`.
5. If the pixel at `(r_line, c)` is azure (8):
   a. Define a target height `h = 3`.
   b. For each step `k` from 0 to `h-1`:
      i. Calculate the source column `c_source = c + k`.
      ii. Calculate the target row `r_target = r_line - 1 - k`.
      iii. If `r_target` is within the grid's top boundary (>= 0) and `c_source` is within the grid's right boundary (< width), copy the color from `input_grid[r_line, c_source]` to `output_grid[r_target, c]`.
6. Return the modified output grid.
