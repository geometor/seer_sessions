            "text": "**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Each input and output grid is 10x10. They consistently feature a border of grey pixels (5). The interior contains a mix of grey (5) and white (0) pixels.\n2.  **Color Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing *some* white pixels (0) in the input to azure pixels (8) in the output. Grey pixels (5) remain unchanged.\n3.  **Pattern of Change:** The pixels that change from white (0) to azure (8) always lie along a specific diagonal line within the grid (excluding the border).\n4.  **Diagonal Determination:** The specific diagonal path chosen depends on the configuration of pixels in the input grid, specifically the colors of the inner corner pixels or the location of the top-leftmost white pixel.\n    *   If the inner top-left corner (1,1) is white, the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right, `r=c`) is used.\n    *   If the inner top-left is grey but the inner top-right corner (1,8 for a 10x10 grid) is white, the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left, `r+c = constant`) is used.\n    *   If both inner top corners are grey, the diagonal starts at the overall top-most, left-most white pixel and proceeds downwards and to the right (`c = r + constant`).\n5.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation rule iterates through the cells along the determined diagonal. If a cell on this diagonal contains a white pixel (0) in the input, it is changed to an azure pixel (8) in the output. All other pixels retain their original color from the input.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
