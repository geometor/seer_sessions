task_description: Change specific white pixels to azure along a determined diagonal path within a grey-bordered grid.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: 10x10 (consistent across examples)
  - border: 1-pixel wide border of grey (5)
  - background_color: grey (5)
  - object_color: white (0)
  - transformed_color: azure (8)

objects:
  - id: grid
    description: The 2D array of pixels.
  - id: border
    description: The outer frame of grey pixels.
    properties:
      color: 5
      thickness: 1
  - id: inner_grid
    description: The grid excluding the border.
    properties:
      - top_left_corner: cell at (1, 1)
      - top_right_corner: cell at (1, width-2)
  - id: pixels
    description: Individual cells within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: 0-9 (specifically 0, 5, 8 observed in this task)
      - location: (row, column)

relationships:
  - type: diagonal_path
    description: A line of cells where row and column indices follow a linear relationship (r=c, r+c=k, or c=r+k).
    determination_rule:
      - condition: Input inner top-left corner (1,1) is white (0).
        path: Main diagonal (r=c).
      - condition: Input inner top-left corner (1,1) is not white (0) AND inner top-right corner (1, W-2) is white (0).
        path: Anti-diagonal (r+c = W-1).
      - condition: Both input inner top corners (1,1) and (1, W-2) are not white (0).
        path: Down-right diagonal starting from the top-most, left-most white pixel (r_min, c_min) in the input grid (c = r + c_min - r_min).

actions:
  - name: determine_diagonal
    input: input_grid
    output: specific_diagonal_path
    logic: Apply the determination_rule based on inner corner colors or the first white pixel.
  - name: transform_pixels
    input: input_grid, specific_diagonal_path
    output: output_grid
    logic: Iterate through cells (r, c) on the specific_diagonal_path. If input_grid[r][c] is white (0), set output_grid[r][c] to azure (8). Otherwise, copy input_grid[r][c] to output_grid[r][c].

constants:
  - white: 0
  - grey: 5
  - azure: 8
