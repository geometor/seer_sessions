"""
Transformation Rule:
Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
Iterate through each row of the input grid. Examine the pixel in the first column (index 0). If this pixel is not white (color > 0), determine its target column based on its color:
- Red (2) moves to column 2.
- Green (3) moves to column 4.
- Yellow (4) moves to column 3.
- Azure (8) moves to column 1.
Place the original pixel's color at its original row but in the determined target column in the output grid.
