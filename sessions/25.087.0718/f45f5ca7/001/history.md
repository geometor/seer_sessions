Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 10x10 grids.
2.  **Input Content:** The input grids contain colored pixels (non-white) exclusively in the first column (index 0). The remaining cells are white (0).
3.  **Output Content:** The output grids also contain the same colored pixels as the input, but these pixels have been moved horizontally to different column positions. The original positions in the first column are now white (0).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a horizontal shift (translation to the right) of each colored pixel originally located in the first column. The amount of shift seems to depend on the specific color of the pixel.
5.  **Color-Shift Relationship:** By comparing the input and output pairs, we can deduce the shift rule for each color present:
    *   Red (2) pixels move 2 columns to the right (from column 0 to column 2).
    *   Green (3) pixels move 4 columns to the right (from column 0 to column 4).
    *   Yellow (4) pixels move 3 columns to the right (from column 0 to column 3).
    *   Azure (8) pixels move 1 column to the right (from column 0 to column 1).
6.  **Row Preservation:** The row position of each colored pixel remains unchanged during the transformation. Only the column position changes.
7.  **Background:** All cells not involved in the shift remain white (0), and the original positions of the shifted pixels become white (0).

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
grid_dimensions:
  - input: 10x10
  - output: 10x10

objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-white (2, 3, 4, 8)
      - location: initially in column 0

actions:
  - type: move
    target: non-white pixels in column 0
    direction: horizontal (right)
    distance: dependent on pixel color
    details:
      - if color is 2 (red), move 2 columns right (to column 2)
      - if color is 3 (green), move 4 columns right (to column 4)
      - if color is 4 (yellow), move 3 columns right (to column 3)
      - if color is 8 (azure), move 1 column right (to column 1)
  - type: change_color
    target: original locations of moved pixels (in column 0)
    new_color: 0 (white)

relationships:
  - The vertical (row) position of each pixel is preserved.
  - The horizontal shift distance is determined solely by the pixel's color.
  - The output grid is initially white, and pixels are placed according to the move action.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
2.  Iterate through each row `R` of the input grid.
3.  Examine the pixel at position (`R`, 0) in the input grid. Let its color be `C`.
4.  If the color `C` is not white (i.e., `C > 0`):
    a.  Determine the target column `Target_Col` based on the color `C`:
        *   If `C` is 2 (red), set `Target_Col` to 2.
        *   If `C` is 3 (green), set `Target_Col` to 4.
        *   If `C` is 4 (yellow), set `Target_Col` to 3.
        *   If `C` is 8 (azure), set `Target_Col` to 1.
    b.  Place a pixel with color `C` at position (`R`, `Target_Col`) in the output grid.
5.  After checking all rows, return the completed output grid.
