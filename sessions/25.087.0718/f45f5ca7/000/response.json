The remaining cells are white (0).\n3.  **Output Content:** The output grids also contain the same colored pixels as the input, but these pixels have been moved horizontally to different column positions. The original positions in the first column are now white (0).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a horizontal shift (translation to the right) of each colored pixel originally located in the first column. The amount of shift seems to depend on the specific color of the pixel.\n5.  **Color-Shift Relationship:** By comparing the input and output pairs, we can deduce the shift rule for each color present:\n    *   Red (2) pixels move 2 columns to the right (from column 0 to column 2).\n    *   Green (3) pixels move 4 columns to the right (from column 0 to column 4).\n    *   Yellow (4) pixels move 3 columns to the right (from column 0 to column 3).\n    *   Azure (8) pixels move 1 column to the right (from column 0 to column 1).\n6.  **Row Preservation:** The row position of each colored pixel remains unchanged during the transformation. Only the column position changes.\n7.  **Background:** All cells not involved in the shift remain white (0), and the original positions of the shifted pixels become white (0).\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
