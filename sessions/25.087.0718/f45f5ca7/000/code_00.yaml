grid_dimensions:
  - input: 10x10
  - output: 10x10

objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-white (2, 3, 4, 8)
      - location: initially in column 0

actions:
  - type: move
    target: non-white pixels in column 0
    direction: horizontal (right)
    distance: dependent on pixel color
    details:
      - if color is 2 (red), move 2 columns right (to column 2)
      - if color is 3 (green), move 4 columns right (to column 4)
      - if color is 4 (yellow), move 3 columns right (to column 3)
      - if color is 8 (azure), move 1 column right (to column 1)
  - type: change_color
    target: original locations of moved pixels (in column 0)
    new_color: 0 (white)

relationships:
  - The vertical (row) position of each pixel is preserved.
  - The horizontal shift distance is determined solely by the pixel's color.
  - The output grid is initially white, and pixels are placed according to the move action.
