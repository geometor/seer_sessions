Record the color and column index for each pixel in this sequence.\n2. Identify all other non-white pixels below the top row (\"isolated pixels\"). Record their color, row, and column index.\n3. For each color present in the top sequence:\n    a. Find the maximum row index among all isolated pixels of the same color. If no such isolated pixel exists, use the grid's last row index.\n    b. Draw a vertical line downwards from the top sequence pixel's position (column) using its color, stopping at the determined maximum row index.\n4. For each isolated pixel:\n    a. Find the column index of the top sequence pixel that shares its color.\n    b. Draw a horizontal line in the isolated pixel's row, using its color, connecting the isolated pixel's original column to the column of the corresponding top sequence pixel.
