Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grids:** The input grids contain a white background (0) and a few scattered non-white pixels.
2.  **Key Features:**
    *   There is always a horizontal sequence of adjacent, non-white pixels located in the top row (row 0). Let's call this the "top sequence".
    *   There are other non-white pixels scattered individually elsewhere in the grid below the top row. Let's call these "isolated pixels".
3.  **Output Grids:** The output grids retain the original non-white pixels from the input but add colored lines.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves drawing vertical and horizontal lines based on the colors and positions of the pixels in the top sequence and the isolated pixels.
    *   Vertical lines extend downwards from each pixel in the top sequence.
    *   Horizontal lines connect the original positions of the isolated pixels to the vertical lines of the same color.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Draw connecting lines based on color-matched pixels.

Input_Features:
  - Background: White pixels (0).
  - Top_Sequence:
      Type: Object group
      Description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels in row 0.
      Properties:
        - Each pixel has a color and a column index.
  - Isolated_Pixels:
      Type: Object group
      Description: Individual non-white pixels located in rows > 0.
      Properties:
        - Each pixel has a color, row index, and column index.

Output_Features:
  - Base: The output grid initially contains all elements from the input grid.
  - Vertical_Lines:
      Type: Added objects (lines)
      Relation: Drawn downwards from each pixel in the Top_Sequence.
      Properties:
        - Color: Matches the color of the originating Top_Sequence pixel.
        - Column: Matches the column of the originating Top_Sequence pixel.
        - Extent (Length): Determined by the row of the lowest isolated pixel of the same color. If no isolated pixel of that color exists, the line extends to the bottom of the grid.
  - Horizontal_Lines:
      Type: Added objects (lines)
      Relation: Drawn horizontally in the row of each Isolated_Pixel.
      Properties:
        - Color: Matches the color of the Isolated_Pixel.
        - Row: Matches the row of the Isolated_Pixel.
        - Extent (Width): Connects the original column of the Isolated_Pixel to the column of the corresponding Vertical_Line (i.e., the column of the Top_Sequence pixel with the same color). Fills all cells between these two columns in that row.

Relationships:
  - Color Matching: The core logic relies on matching the colors of Isolated_Pixels to the colors of pixels in the Top_Sequence.
  - Spatial Connection: Horizontal lines link the position of an Isolated_Pixel to the Vertical_Line derived from its color-matched counterpart in the Top_Sequence.

Implicit_Rule:
  - Line_Extension_Default: If a color in the Top_Sequence has no matching Isolated_Pixel, its Vertical_Line extends to the bottom grid boundary.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid as the base for the output grid.
2.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels in the top row (row 0). For each pixel in this sequence, record its color and column index.
3.  Identify all other non-white pixels in the grid (below row 0). For each, record its color, row index, and column index. Call these "isolated pixels".
4.  For each pixel in the top sequence (color `C`, column `J_top`):
    a. Find all isolated pixels that have the same color `C`.
    b. Determine the maximum row index (`R_max`) among these matched isolated pixels.
    c. If there are no isolated pixels with color `C`, set `R_max` to the last row index of the grid.
    d. Draw a vertical line downwards using color `C` in column `J_top`, starting from row 1 and ending at row `R_max`.
5.  For each isolated pixel (color `C`, row `R_iso`, column `J_iso`):
    a. Find the column index (`J_top`) of the pixel in the top sequence that has the color `C`.
    b. Determine the start column `J_start = min(J_iso, J_top)` and end column `J_end = max(J_iso, J_top)`.
    c. Draw a horizontal line using color `C` in row `R_iso`, filling all cells from column `J_start` to column `J_end` inclusive.
