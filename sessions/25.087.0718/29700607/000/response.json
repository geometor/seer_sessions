Let's call this the \"top sequence\".\n    *   There are other non-white pixels scattered individually elsewhere in the grid below the top row. Let's call these \"isolated pixels\".\n3.  **Output Grids:** The output grids retain the original non-white pixels from the input but add colored lines.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves drawing vertical and horizontal lines based on the colors and positions of the pixels in the top sequence and the isolated pixels.\n    *   Vertical lines extend downwards from each pixel in the top sequence.\n    *   Horizontal lines connect the original positions of the isolated pixels to the vertical lines of the same color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
