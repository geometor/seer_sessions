Task: Draw connecting lines based on color-matched pixels.

Input_Features:
  - Background: White pixels (0).
  - Top_Sequence:
      Type: Object group
      Description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels in row 0.
      Properties:
        - Each pixel has a color and a column index.
  - Isolated_Pixels:
      Type: Object group
      Description: Individual non-white pixels located in rows > 0.
      Properties:
        - Each pixel has a color, row index, and column index.

Output_Features:
  - Base: The output grid initially contains all elements from the input grid.
  - Vertical_Lines:
      Type: Added objects (lines)
      Relation: Drawn downwards from each pixel in the Top_Sequence.
      Properties:
        - Color: Matches the color of the originating Top_Sequence pixel.
        - Column: Matches the column of the originating Top_Sequence pixel.
        - Extent (Length): Determined by the row of the lowest isolated pixel of the same color. If no isolated pixel of that color exists, the line extends to the bottom of the grid.
  - Horizontal_Lines:
      Type: Added objects (lines)
      Relation: Drawn horizontally in the row of each Isolated_Pixel.
      Properties:
        - Color: Matches the color of the Isolated_Pixel.
        - Row: Matches the row of the Isolated_Pixel.
        - Extent (Width): Connects the original column of the Isolated_Pixel to the column of the corresponding Vertical_Line (i.e., the column of the Top_Sequence pixel with the same color). Fills all cells between these two columns in that row.

Relationships:
  - Color Matching: The core logic relies on matching the colors of Isolated_Pixels to the colors of pixels in the Top_Sequence.
  - Spatial Connection: Horizontal lines link the position of an Isolated_Pixel to the Vertical_Line derived from its color-matched counterpart in the Top_Sequence.

Implicit_Rule:
  - Line_Extension_Default: If a color in the Top_Sequence has no matching Isolated_Pixel, its Vertical_Line extends to the bottom grid boundary.
