task_context:
  description: Move objects vertically based on their original position, preserving their internal structure.
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: 0 (white)
    - height_varies: true
    - width_varies: true
  object_properties:
    - type: connected components of non-background color (adjacency includes diagonals)
    - attributes:
        - color: distinct integer 1-9
        - shape: preserved during transformation
        - position: defined by bounding box [row_min, row_max, col_min, col_max]
    - persistence: all input objects appear in the output
transformation:
  actions:
    - action: identify_objects
      description: Find all distinct connected components (objects) of non-background colors in the input grid. Use diagonal connectivity.
      inputs:
        - input_grid
      outputs:
        - list_of_objects: each with color, pixel coordinates, and bounding box
    - action: calculate_new_position
      description: For each object, calculate its new top row based on the grid height (H) and the object's original bottom row boundary (row_max from bounding box [row_min, row_max)). The formula is new_top_row = H - row_max. The column position (col_min) remains unchanged.
      inputs:
        - object_bounding_box
        - grid_height
      outputs:
        - new_top_left_coordinate: (new_top_row, col_min)
    - action: reconstruct_output
      description: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color. Place each identified object into the output grid at its calculated new top-left coordinate, preserving the object's original shape and color. Do *not* flip or rotate the object pattern itself.
      inputs:
        - list_of_objects: with original patterns and calculated new positions
        - output_grid_dimensions
        - background_color
      outputs:
        - output_grid
