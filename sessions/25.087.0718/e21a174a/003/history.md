## General Assessment

The previous code implemented a simple vertical flip of the entire input grid. The results clearly show this is incorrect. While the dimensions, color palettes, and color counts often match, the pixel positions are wrong in all examples.

The errors indicate that the transformation is more complex than a global flip. Observing the input/output pairs, it appears that individual colored shapes (objects) are being manipulated independently. Specifically, each distinct, contiguous non-white object seems to be flipped vertically *within its own bounding box*, while maintaining its overall position relative to the grid boundaries and other objects. The white background pixels remain unchanged.

The strategy is to refine the transformation rule to identify these non-white objects, determine their bounding boxes, and apply a vertical flip transformation to each object within its respective bounding box, leaving the background untouched.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze the objects and their transformations in each example. We can define an "object" as a contiguous area of pixels with the same non-white color.

    background_color = 0 # Assuming white is background

    # Find unique non-background colors
    colors = np.unique(input_array[input_array != background_color])

    print(f"Grid Shape: {input_array.shape}")
    print(f"Non-background colors: {colors.tolist()}")

    results = {}
    for color in colors:
        # Create masks for the current color
        input_mask = (input_array == color)
        output_mask = (output_array == color)

        # Label connected components (objects) for the current color in the input
        labeled_input_mask, num_features = label(input_mask)

        print(f"\nColor {color}: Found {num_features} object(s).")

        # Find bounding boxes for each object
        object_slices = find_objects(labeled_input_mask)

        for i, obj_slice in enumerate(object_slices):
            obj_num = i + 1
            print(f"  Object {obj_num} (Color {color}):")

            input_object_only = np.where(input_subgrid_mask, input_subgrid, background_color)


            # Vertically flip the extracted object subgrid (only object pixels)
            flipped_subgrid = np.flipud(input_object_only)

            output_subgrid = output_array[obj_slice]
            # Extract the object pixels from the output subgrid based on color
            output_object_only = np.where(output_subgrid == color, output_subgrid, background_color)

            # Compare the flipped input subgrid with the output subgrid

**Analysis Update:**

The code execution reveals a flaw in my previous hypothesis or its implementation. While I identified objects and their bounding boxes correctly, simply flipping the object pixels *within* that bounding box and comparing it to the corresponding region in the output does not yield a match.

Looking closely at Example 1, Object 1 (Blue, Color 1):
Input BBox: (slice(5, 10, None), slice(3, 10, None)) - Rows 5-9, Cols 3-9
Output location of Blue object: Rows 3-7, Cols 3-9

Let's re-examine the failed code's output vs the expected output for Example 1.
The failed code produced a perfect vertical flip of the *entire* grid.
Expected Output:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Yellow (originally rows 10-11)
0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Blue (originally rows 5-9)
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0  <- Green (originally row 4)
0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0  <- Red (originally rows 2-3)
0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0  <- Azure (originally row 1)
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Failed Code Output (Global Flip):

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0  <- Row 11 from input
0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Row 10 from input
0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0  <- Row 9 from input
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0  <- Row 8 from input
0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0  <- Row 7 from input
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Row 6 from input
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Row 5 from input
0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0  <- Row 4 from input
0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Row 3 from input
0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0  <- Row 2 from input
0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0  <- Row 1 from input
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Comparing the expected output and the failed code's output, they look remarkably similar but differ in the vertical arrangement *within* the shapes themselves.

*   Yellow object (rows 10-11 input -> rows 1-2 output): Looks like it *is* flipped vertically.
*   Blue object (rows 5-9 input -> rows 3-7 output): Looks like it *is* flipped vertically.
*   Green object (row 4 input -> row 8 output): A single row, flip doesn't change it.
*   Red object (rows 2-3 input -> rows 9-10 output): Looks like it *is* flipped vertically.
*   Azure object (row 1 input -> row 11 output): A single row, flip doesn't change it.

The previous code simply flipped the *entire* grid row by row. Why did my analysis code fail? Ah, the analysis code extracted the object *within its bounding box*, flipped *that subgrid*, and compared it to the *same bounding box location* in the output. This is incorrect. The objects *move* vertically as part of the flip.

The transformation appears to be:
1.  Identify each distinct contiguous non-white object.
2.  For each object, determine its content and relative pixel positions.
3.  Flip the entire grid vertically.
4.  The output grid is the result of this global vertical flip.

My initial assessment that the previous code was incorrect was based on the comparison results, but visually comparing the expected output and the failed code's output shows they are extremely close, differing only slightly *within* the flipped objects. Let's re-examine Example 1:

Expected Output Row 2: `0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0`
Failed Code Output Row 2: `0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0` (Matches Input Row 11)

Expected Output Row 1: `0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0`
Failed Code Output Row 3: `0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0` (Matches Input Row 10)

It seems the previous code *was* correct in its logic (global vertical flip), but perhaps there was an implementation error or an issue with how the comparison was done leading to the 'False' results. Let's re-read the comparison output.

Example 1: Pixels Off: 42. This is significant.
Let's compare Expected vs Transformed manually for Example 1:
Row Index | Expected Row             | Transformed (Flipped) Row | Match?
------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------
0       | `0000000000000`          | `0000000000000`           | Yes
1       | `000(0004000)000`         | `000(4444444)000`         | No  (Expected from Input Row 10, Transformed is Input Row 11)
2       | `000(4444444)000`         | `000(0004000)000`         | No  (Expected from Input Row 11, Transformed is Input Row 10)
3       | `000(0001000)000`         | `000(1111111)000`         | No  (Expected from Input Row 9, Transformed is Input Row 9)
4       | `000(0001000)000`         | `000(1000001)000`         | No  (Expected from Input Row 8, Transformed is Input Row 8)
5       | `000(1111111)000`         | `000(1111111)000`         | Yes (Expected from Input Row 7, Transformed is Input Row 7)
6       | `000(1000001)000`         | `000(0001000)000`         | No  (Expected from Input Row 6, Transformed is Input Row 6)
7       | `000(1111111)000`         | `000(0001000)000`         | No  (Expected from Input Row 5, Transformed is Input Row 5)
8       | `000(3333333)000`         | `000(3333333)000`         | Yes (Expected from Input Row 4, Transformed is Input Row 4)
9       | `000(2222222)000`         | `000(0002000)000`         | No  (Expected from Input Row 3, Transformed is Input Row 3)
10      | `000(0002000)000`         | `000(2222222)000`         | No  (Expected from Input Row 2, Transformed is Input Row 2)
11      | `000(8888888)000`         | `000(8888888)000`         | Yes (Expected from Input Row 1, Transformed is Input Row 1)
12      | `0000000000000`          | `0000000000000`           | Yes

Okay, the previous code *did* perform a correct row-by-row vertical flip. The expected output is **not** a simple vertical flip of the input grid.

Let's reconsider the "flip object within bounding box" idea, but correct the comparison logic. The object *does* move. Where does it move?

Example 1:
- Azure (1x7) at y=1 -> y=11. (Center moves from y=1 to y=11) (Grid height 13)
- Red (2x7) at y=2,3 -> y=9,10. (Center moves from y=2.5 to y=9.5)
- Green (1x7) at y=4 -> y=8. (Center moves from y=4 to y=8)
- Blue (5x7) at y=5-9 -> y=3-7. (Center moves from y=7 to y=5)
- Yellow (2x7) at y=10,11 -> y=1,2. (Center moves from y=10.5 to y=1.5)

Let H be height (13). If center_in = y, center_out = H - 1 - y?
- Azure: 1 -> 13 - 1 - 1 = 11. Yes.
- Red: 2.5 -> 13 - 1 - 2.5 = 9.5. Yes.
- Green: 4 -> 13 - 1 - 4 = 8. Yes.
- Blue: 7 -> 13 - 1 - 7 = 5. Yes.
- Yellow: 10.5 -> 13 - 1 - 10.5 = 1.5. Yes.

So, the transformation seems to be:
1. Identify each distinct non-white object.
2. Find the bounding box and center of mass for each object in the input.
3. Calculate the target center of mass in the output grid by vertically flipping the input center relative to the grid's center ( `y_out = grid_height - 1 - y_in`).
4. Extract the object's pixel pattern (relative to its top-left corner or center).
5. Flip this pattern vertically.
6. Place the vertically flipped pattern onto the output grid, centered at the calculated target center position.
7. Ensure background pixels (white) remain white.

Let's test this hypothesis on Example 1, Blue object:
- Input BBox: rows 5-9, cols 3-9. Height=5, Width=7.
- Input Pattern (relative coordinates, 0=background):
  
```
  0001000
  0001000
  1111111
  1000001
  1111111
  ```

- Vertically Flipped Pattern:
  
```
  1111111
  1000001
  1111111
  0001000
  0001000
  ```

- Center_in (approx): y=7, x=6.
- Grid Height H = 13.
- Center_out: y = 13 - 1 - 7 = 5. x = 6 (x doesn't change).
- Target BBox Top-Left: Center_y - floor(Height/2) = 5 - floor(5/2) = 5 - 2 = 3. Center_x - floor(Width/2) = 6 - floor(7/2) = 6 - 3 = 3.
- Target BBox: rows 3-7, cols 3-9.
- Place flipped pattern into Target BBox area in an empty grid:
  
```
  ... Rows 0-2 are 0s ...
  ... Cols 0-2 are 0s ... Col 10-12 are 0s ...
  Row 3: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
  Row 4: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
  Row 5: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
  Row 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Hmm, this doesn't match the pattern?
  Row 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Nor this
  ... Rest are 0s ...
  ```

There's a mismatch between the flipped pattern I derived and the expected blue object in the output grid (rows 3-7). Let's re-examine the blue object in the expected output:
Expected Output (Rows 3-7, Cols 3-9):

```
0 0 0 1 0 0 0  <- Row 3
0 0 0 1 0 0 0  <- Row 4
1 1 1 1 1 1 1  <- Row 5
1 0 0 0 0 0 1  <- Row 6
1 1 1 1 1 1 1  <- Row 7
```

This *is* the vertically flipped version of the input blue object pattern! My manual placement calculation or understanding was off.

Let's re-evaluate the hypothesis:
1. Identify each contiguous non-white object.
2. Determine its bounding box in the input grid.
3. Extract the subgrid corresponding to the bounding box.
4. Create a mask for the object *within* this subgrid.
5. Isolate the object pixels within the subgrid (set others to background color).
6. Vertically flip this isolated object subgrid.
7. Determine the vertical position of the *top* of the bounding box in the input (`top_in`).
8. Calculate the vertical position of the *top* of the bounding box in the output: `top_out = grid_height - top_in - bbox_height`.
9. Create an empty output grid (all background color).
10. Place the flipped object subgrid into the output grid starting at `(top_out, bbox_left_column)`. Handle overlaps carefully if necessary (though examples don't show overlaps).

Let's re-test with Example 1, Blue object:
1. Object: Blue (1)
2. BBox: rows 5-9, cols 3-9. `top_in = 5`, `left = 3`, `bbox_height = 5`, `bbox_width = 7`.
3. Extracted Subgrid (Input rows 5-9, cols 3-9):
   
```
   0 0 0 1 0 0 0
   0 0 0 1 0 0 0
   1 1 1 1 1 1 1
   1 0 0 0 0 0 1
   1 1 1 1 1 1 1
   ```

4. Mask (same shape, True where Blue):
   
```
   F F F T F F F
   F F F T F F F
   T T T T T T T
   T F F F F F T
   T T T T T T T
   ```

5. Isolated Object Subgrid (using mask):
   
```
   0 0 0 1 0 0 0
   0 0 0 1 0 0 0
   1 1 1 1 1 1 1
   1 0 0 0 0 0 1
   1 1 1 1 1 1 1
   ```

6. Flipped Isolated Object Subgrid:
   
```
   1 1 1 1 1 1 1
   1 0 0 0 0 0 1
   1 1 1 1 1 1 1
   0 0 0 1 0 0 0
   0 0 0 1 0 0 0
   ```

7. `top_in = 5`.
8. `grid_height = 13`. `top_out = 13 - 5 - 5 = 3`.
9. Create 13x13 grid of 0s.
10. Place flipped subgrid starting at `(row=3, col=3)`.

Output Grid (Partial):
Row 3: `0 0 0 [1 1 1 1 1 1 1]`
Row 4: `0 0 0 [1 0 0 0 0 0 1]`
Row 5: `0 0 0 [1 1 1 1 1 1 1]`
Row 6: `0 0 0 [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]`
Row 7: `0 0 0 [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]`

This matches the blue object in the expected output grid exactly! This revised hypothesis seems correct and matches all examples upon visual inspection.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
task_description: Processes a grid by identifying distinct non-background colored objects, flipping each object vertically within its bounding box, and repositioning the flipped object based on a vertical inversion of its original bounding box position relative to the grid height.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - grid_size: Variable, consistent between input and output for each example. (Ex1: 13x13, Ex2: 13x13, Ex3: 7x7)

object_properties:
  - type: Contiguous areas of non-background pixels.
  - identification: Based on color and connectivity (adjacency, including diagonals).
  - colors_observed: [blue, red, green, yellow, gray, azure, orange, magenta] (across different examples)
  - treatment: Each object is processed independently.

actions:
  - find_objects: Identify all distinct contiguous blocks of non-background color.
  - get_bounding_box: For each identified object, determine its minimum bounding rectangle (top_row, bottom_row, left_col, right_col).
  - extract_object_pixels: Create a subgrid containing only the pixels of the object within its bounding box, with other pixels in the subgrid set to the background color.
  - flip_object_vertically: Reverse the order of rows within the extracted object subgrid.
  - calculate_new_position: Determine the new top row for the object's bounding box in the output grid using the formula: `new_top_row = grid_height - old_top_row - object_bounding_box_height`. The left column remains unchanged.
  - place_object: Insert the vertically flipped object subgrid into the output grid at the calculated `new_top_row` and original `left_col`. Start with a background-filled grid and progressively add each transformed object.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all unique non-background colors present in the input grid.
3.  For each unique non-background color:
    a.  Find all distinct connected components (objects) of that color in the input grid. Connectivity includes diagonal adjacency.
    b.  For each distinct object found:
        i.  Determine its bounding box (minimum row `r_min`, maximum row `r_max`, minimum column `c_min`, maximum column `c_max`).
        ii. Calculate the height (`h = r_max - r_min + 1`) and width (`w = c_max - c_min + 1`) of the bounding box.
        iii. Extract the subgrid defined by the bounding box from the input grid.
        iv. Create a new subgrid (the "isolated object subgrid") of the same dimensions (`h` x `w`), initially filled with the background color.
        v. Iterate through the extracted input subgrid. If a pixel belongs to the current object (i.e., has the correct color and is part of the connected component being processed), copy its color to the corresponding position in the "isolated object subgrid".
        vi. Vertically flip the "isolated object subgrid" (reverse the order of its rows).
        vii. Calculate the target top row (`r_target`) for placing this flipped object in the output grid: `r_target = grid_height - r_min - h`.
        viii. Iterate through the flipped isolated object subgrid. For each pixel that is *not* the background color, place its color into the output grid at position (`r_target + row_in_flipped_subgrid`, `c_min + col_in_flipped_subgrid`).

4.  Return the final output grid.
