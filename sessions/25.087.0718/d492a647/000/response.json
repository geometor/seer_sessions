Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at location (`r`, `c`).\n    6.  Check if the color of the input pixel at (`r`, `c`) is white (0).\n    7.  If it is white, determine the parity of the current row `r` (`current_row_parity`) and the parity of the current column `c` (`current_col_parity`).\n    8.  Compare the parities: If `current_row_parity` matches `target_row_parity` AND `current_col_parity` matches `target_col_parity`, then change the color of the pixel at location (`r`, `c`) in the *output* grid to the `target_color`.\n    9.  If the input pixel is not white, or if the parities do not match the target parities, the corresponding pixel in the output grid retains its original color (from the initial copy).\n    10.
