**General Assessment**

The previous code successfully identified horizontal strips delimited by all-white rows and selected the topmost strip with the maximum number of non-white pixels. This logic worked perfectly for Example 1 but failed for Examples 2, 3, and 4.

*   **Example 2 Failure:** The code selected the first strip (17 non-white pixels), but the expected output corresponds to a different grid structure, not simply the second strip (16 non-white pixels).
*   **Example 3 Failure:** There is only one strip (18 non-white pixels). The code correctly selected it, but the expected output is different from this input strip.
*   **Example 4 Failure:** The code selected the first strip (20 non-white pixels), but the expected output differs from both the first and second (19 non-white pixels) input strips.

This indicates the rule is not simply selecting an existing strip based on non-white pixel count. The transformation likely involves identifying a specific strip based on some criteria (possibly still related to pixel counts or other properties) and then *modifying* that strip, or generating the output based on properties *derived* from the strips, rather than directly copying one.

**Strategy:**

1.  Re-analyze each example, focusing on the relationship between the input strips and the expected output.
2.  Use `tool_code` to accurately calculate properties of input strips and the expected output for comparison.
3.  Look for alternative criteria for selecting a "target" strip (e.g., total pixels, number of unique colors, density, specific shapes).
4.  Examine the differences between the "target" input strip (if one can be identified) and the expected output to understand the modification rule. Consider operations like pixel swapping, color changes, or geometric transformations applied *within* the strip boundaries.
5.  Formulate a revised hypothesis that accommodates all examples.

**Observations from Metrics:**

1.  **Strip Definition:** Horizontal strips separated by all-white rows seems correct. All examples have inputs with such strips, and the output grid always has the same dimensions (height and width) as one or more of the input strips.
2.  **Selection Criterion:** The "max non-white pixels, topmost tiebreak" rule correctly identifies the target strip only in Example 1. In Examples 2, 3, and 4, while the *shape* and *non-white pixel count* of the output match the input strip(s) selected by the old rule, the *content* (pixel arrangement/colors) is different.
3.  **Tie-breaking:** Example 1, 2 and 4 have ties in non-white pixel counts between strips. Example 1's output matched the *topmost* strip among the ties. Examples 2 and 4 *also* had ties, the old rule picked the topmost, but the output was different. This suggests the tie-breaking rule might be different, or the primary selection criterion isn't just the non-white count.
4.  **Modification:** Since the output shape and non-white count often match an input strip, but the pixels differ, a modification *within* the selected strip is happening. The number of differing pixels is significant (14, 18, 22).

**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation seems to involve:
1.  Identifying all horizontal strips separated by white rows.
2.  Selecting *one* target strip. The criterion might *not* be the maximum non-white pixel count, or the tie-breaking rule is different. Let's reconsider: maybe it's the *minimum* non-white count? Or perhaps the strip with the most *unique* colors? Or maybe related to the *sum* of pixel values? Or maybe the strip with the *most* white pixels *within* the strip? Let's quickly check the pixel counts again from the tool output.
    *   Ex 1: Counts 18, 18, 18. Output matches strip 1 (topmost).
    *   Ex 2: Counts 15, 15. Old rule picked strip 1. Output shape/count matches, content differs.
    *   Ex 3: Count 20. Only one strip. Output shape/count matches, content differs.
    *   Ex 4: Counts 21, 21. Old rule picked strip 1. Output shape/count matches, content differs.
    The counts are often identical. The selection rule must be more nuanced or combined with the modification step.
3.  Modifying the selected strip. What kind of modification could preserve the non-white pixel count but change the pattern?
    *   Could it be swapping pixels?
    *   Could it involve combining information from *multiple* strips if counts are tied?
    *   Look at Example 2 again: Input Strip 1 and Strip 2 have 15 non-white pixels each. The output also has 15. Could the output be a pixel-wise combination (e.g., XOR, MAX, MIN) of Strip 1 and Strip 2?

Let's test the combination idea on Example 2.
Input Strip 1:

```
2 0 2 0 3 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 2 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 1 0
2 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0
```

Input Strip 2:

```
2 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 1 0 1
2 2 2 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 2 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 1
```

Expected Output:

```
2 2 2 0 3 0 3 0 1 0 0
0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 1 1
0 2 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 1
```

Consider pixel (0,0): Strip1=2, Strip2=2 -> Output=2. (Max or Min?)
Consider pixel (0,1): Strip1=0, Strip2=0 -> Output=2. (Neither Max nor Min?) - Hypothesis seems wrong.

Let's reconsider the selection. What if the selection criterion is different?
Maybe select the strip with the *most distinct colors*?
*   Ex 1: Strip 1 (2,1,3), Strip 2 (2,1,3), Strip 3 (2,1,3). All have 3 colors. Tiebreak -> Topmost. Matches.
*   Ex 2: Strip 1 (2,3,1), Strip 2 (2,3,1). Both have 3 colors. Tiebreak -> Topmost (Strip 1). Output is different. Doesn't explain the modification.
*   Ex 3: Strip 1 (2,3,1,5). 4 colors. Only one strip. Output is different.
*   Ex 4: Strip 1 (2,3,1,5), Strip 2 (2,3,1,5). Both have 4 colors. Tiebreak -> Topmost (Strip 1). Output is different.

This doesn't seem right either.

Let's look at the *content* differences carefully.
Example 2: Output vs Input Strip 1 (which old rule picked).

```
Input Strip 1:          Expected Output:        Difference (Output-Input):
2 0 2 0 3 0 0 0 1 1 1   2 2 2 0 3 0 3 0 1 0 0   0 2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 -1 -1
0 2 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 1 0   0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 1 1   0 0 0 0 -3 0 -3 0 1  0  1
2 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0   0 2 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 1  -2 2 -2 0 3 0 0 0 0 -1  1
```

This simple subtraction isn't helpful.

What if the rule involves finding *all* strips with the maximum non-white count and combining them somehow?
*   Ex 1: All 3 strips have max count (18). Output is Strip 1. Rule: If all strips have the same max count, output the first one?
*   Ex 2: Both strips have max count (15). Output is different.
*   Ex 3: Only one strip. Output is different.
*   Ex 4: Both strips have max count (21). Output is different.

This suggests Ex 1 might be a specific case. The general rule must handle Ex 2, 3, 4.

Let's rethink the "strip" idea. Could it be defined differently? By columns? No, the examples strongly suggest horizontal separation by white rows.

What if we select the strip based on the maximum non-white count, breaking ties by selecting the *lowest* strip instead of the highest?
*   Ex 1: Counts 18, 18, 18. Lowest is Strip 3. Output is Strip 1. Doesn't match.
*   Ex 2: Counts 15, 15. Lowest is Strip 2. Output is different.
*   Ex 3: Count 20. Lowest is Strip 1. Output is different.
*   Ex 4: Counts 21, 21. Lowest is Strip 2. Output is different.

What if it's minimum count?
*   Ex 1: Min count 18. All strips. Tiebreak Topmost -> Strip 1. Matches output.
*   Ex 2: Min count 15. Both strips. Tiebreak Topmost -> Strip 1. Output different.
*   Ex 3: Min count 20. Strip 1. Output different.
*   Ex 4: Min count 21. Both strips. Tiebreak Topmost -> Strip 1. Output different.

This isn't working. Let's focus on the modification in Example 3, as it's simplest (only one input strip).

Input Strip 1 (Ex 3):

```
2 2 2 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 5 0 5
0 0 2 0 3 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 5 0 5
0 0 2 0 3 3 3 0 1 0 0 0 5 0 5
```

Expected Output (Ex 3):

```
2 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 5 5 5
2 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 5
2 2 2 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 5
```

Differences:
- Row 0: (2,2) -> (0,0), (0,0) -> (1,0), (5,0,5) -> (5,5,5)
- Row 1: (0,0,2) -> (2,0,0), (3,0,0,0,0,1,1) -> (0,3,3,0,1,0,1), (5,0,5) -> (0,0,5)
- Row 2: (0,0,2) -> (2,2,2), (3,3,3,0,1,0,0) -> (3,0,0,0,1,0,1), (5,0,5) -> (0,0,5)

This looks like some kind of pixel shifting or conditional replacement, possibly based on neighbors or column/row properties within the strip.

Consider columns that are *entirely white* within the strip.
Ex 3 Input Strip: Columns 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13 are all white.
Ex 3 Output: Columns 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13 are NOT all white anymore. Column 11 changed.

Let's look at the maximum count strip selection again, but focus on *how* the output differs from that selected strip.
In Ex 2, 3, 4, the shape and non-white count match the topmost strip with the maximum non-white count. The pixels that *change* must be related to some property.

Maybe the rule is:
1. Find strips.
2. Find the max non-white count `M`.
3. Select *all* strips that have count `M`.
4. Create the output grid by combining these selected strips pixel-wise. What combination rule?
   - Pixel (r, c) in output = MAX(pixel(r, c) of all selected strips)?
   - Pixel (r, c) in output = MIN(pixel(r, c) of all selected strips)? (Ignoring 0?)
   - Pixel (r, c) in output = SUM(pixel(r, c) of all selected strips) % 10?
   - Pixel (r, c) in output = Pixel from the *last* (lowest) selected strip?

Let's test "MAX" combination:
*   Ex 1: All 3 strips selected.
    - Output(0,0) = Max(Strip1(0,0)=2, Strip2(0,0)=0, Strip3(0,0)=2) = 2. Matches Output(0,0).
    - Output(0,1) = Max(Strip1(0,1)=0, Strip2(0,1)=2, Strip3(0,1)=0) = 2. Output is 0. Fails.
Let's test "Pixel from LAST selected strip":
*   Ex 1: All 3 strips selected. Last is Strip 3. Output should be Strip 3. Actual output is Strip 1. Fails.

Let's reconsider the selection: Maybe it's the strip with the *maximum sum of pixel values*?

**Further Observations:**

The "Max Sum" rule (with tiebreaks: max non-white count, then topmost) correctly selects the strip matching the output in Example 1. However, it still fails to explain Examples 2, 3, and 4.
- In Ex 2, it selects Strip 1, but the output is different (though Sum and Count match).
- In Ex 3, it selects Strip 1, but the output is different (Sum differs, Count matches).
- In Ex 4, it selects Strip 2 (the lower one due to higher sum), but the output is different (Sum differs, Count matches).

Crucially, in Examples 3 and 4, the *sum* of the pixels in the output grid is different from the sum of the pixels in the strip selected by the Max Sum rule (or any input strip). However, the *non-white count* remains the same. This strongly implies a transformation that replaces some non-white pixels with other non-white pixels, or swaps positions of non-white pixels, rather than just adding or removing them.

Let's reconsider Example 3. One strip, sum 59, count 20. Output sum 53, count 20. The sum decreased by 6. This could happen if, for example, a '5' was replaced by a '1' and a '3' by a '1' (change -4 + -2 = -6). Or a '5' and '1' were replaced by '0's (change -6) BUT this would decrease the count. So it must be color replacement.

Look at Ex 3 Input Strip 1 vs Output:
Input:

```
2 2 2 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 5 0 5
0 0 2 0 3 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 5 0 5
0 0 2 0 3 3 3 0 1 0 0 0 5 0 5
```

Output:

```
2 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 5 5 5  (Sum: 2+3+1+1+5+5+5=22) Input row sum: 2+2+2+3+1+5+5=20
2 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 5  (Sum: 2+3+3+1+1+5=15)    Input row sum: 2+3+1+1+5+5=17
2 2 2 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 5  (Sum: 2+2+2+3+1+1+5=16)  Input row sum: 2+3+3+3+1+5+5=22
Total Output Sum: 22+15+16 = 53. Total Input Sum: 20+17+22 = 59. Diff = -6.
```

The changes seem complex. It's not a simple color substitution. Notice the changes in the 2s (red) and 5s (gray) especially.

Maybe the rule involves finding the strip with the highest sum, and then performing a specific geometric or pattern-based modification *within* that strip?

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Identify horizontal strips of non-white pixels separated by all-white rows, select one strip based on a specific criterion, and potentially modify it to produce the output.

definitions:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - name: white_pixel
    value: 0
  - name: non_white_pixel
    value: 1-9
  - name: white_row
    type: A row in the grid where all pixels are white_pixel.
  - name: strip
    type: A contiguous subgrid consisting of one or more rows located between two white_rows (or grid boundaries).

observations:
  - all_examples:
      input_contains_strips: Yes, separated by horizontal white_rows.
      output_is_a_grid: Yes.
      output_dimensions_match_input_strip: Yes, the output grid always has the same height and width as at least one of the input strips.
  - example_1:
      input_strips: 3 strips, all shape (3, 11).
      strip_non_white_counts: [18, 18, 18]
      strip_sums: [37, 37, 34]
      output: Exact copy of the first (topmost) input strip.
      selection_rule_match: Matches "Max Non-White Count, Topmost tiebreak". Matches "Max Sum, Max Non-White tiebreak, Topmost tiebreak".
  - example_2:
      input_strips: 2 strips, all shape (3, 11).
      strip_non_white_counts: [15, 15]
      strip_sums: [30, 30]
      output: Different content from both input strips.
      output_non_white_count: 15 (matches input strips)
      output_sum: 30 (matches input strips)
      selection_rule_match: Does not match simple selection. Implies modification of a selected strip (likely Strip 1 based on tiebreaks).
  - example_3:
      input_strips: 1 strip, shape (3, 15).
      strip_non_white_counts: [20]
      strip_sums: [59]
      output: Different content from the input strip.
      output_non_white_count: 20 (matches input strip)
      output_sum: 53 (differs from input strip sum)
      selection_rule_match: Does not match simple selection. Implies modification.
  - example_4:
      input_strips: 2 strips, all shape (3, 15).
      strip_non_white_counts: [21, 21]
      strip_sums: [56, 58]
      output: Different content from both input strips.
      output_non_white_count: 21 (matches input strips)
      output_sum: 57 (differs from both input strip sums)
      selection_rule_match: Does not match simple selection. Max Sum rule selects Strip 2. Output differs. Implies modification.

derived_properties:
  - modification_preserves_non_white_count: Yes, in all examples where output differs from input strip, the non-white pixel count is preserved.
  - modification_preserves_sum: No, Examples 3 and 4 show the sum changes.

hypotheses:
  - selection_criterion: Max Sum, with tiebreaks (Max Non-White count, then Topmost). This selects Strip 1 (Ex 1, 2, 3) and Strip 2 (Ex 4).
  - transformation: The selected strip undergoes a modification that preserves the non-white pixel count but can alter the sum and pixel positions/colors. The exact modification rule is unclear but likely depends on the internal structure/patterns within the selected strip.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Strips:** Scan the input grid row by row. Identify rows composed entirely of the white color (0). These rows act as separators. Define horizontal "strips" as the contiguous blocks of rows between these separators (or between a separator and the top/bottom edge of the grid).
2.  **Calculate Properties:** For each identified strip, calculate:
    *   The sum of all pixel values within the strip.
    *   The count of non-white pixels (pixels with values 1-9) within the strip.
3.  **Select Target Strip:**
    *   Find the maximum sum among all strips.
    *   Identify all strips that have this maximum sum.
    *   If there is only one strip with the maximum sum, select it.
    *   If there is a tie in sums, compare the non-white pixel counts of the tied strips. Identify all strips among the tied ones that have the highest non-white pixel count.
    *   If there is still a tie (same max sum and same max non-white count), select the strip that appears highest in the input grid (i.e., has the smallest starting row index).
4.  **Transform Selected Strip:** (*This step is uncertain*) The selected strip is transformed into the output grid. This transformation preserves the shape (height and width) and the count of non-white pixels, but the arrangement and possibly the specific colors (values) of the non-white pixels may change, potentially altering the total sum of pixel values. The exact rules for this transformation are not yet determined but likely involve rearranging or modifying pixels based on local patterns or coordinates within the strip.
5.  **Output:** The transformed strip is the final output grid.
