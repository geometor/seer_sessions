            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code successfully identified horizontal strips delimited by all-white rows and selected the topmost strip with the maximum number of non-white pixels. This logic worked perfectly for Example 1 but failed for Examples 2, 3, and 4.\n\n*   **Example 2 Failure:** The code selected the first strip (17 non-white pixels), but the expected output corresponds to a different grid structure, not simply the second strip (16 non-white pixels).\n*   **Example 3 Failure:** There is only one strip (18 non-white pixels). The code correctly selected it, but the expected output is different from this input strip.\n*   **Example 4 Failure:** The code selected the first strip (20 non-white pixels), but the expected output differs from both the first and second (19 non-white pixels) input strips.\n\nThis indicates the rule is not simply selecting an existing strip based on non-white pixel count. The transformation likely involves identifying a specific strip based on some criteria (possibly still related to pixel counts or other properties) and then *modifying* that strip, or generating the output based on properties *derived* from the strips, rather than directly copying one.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Re-analyze each example, focusing on the relationship between the input strips and the expected output.\n2.  Use `tool_code` to accurately calculate properties of input strips and the expected output for comparison.\n3.  Look for alternative criteria for selecting a \"target\" strip (e.g., total pixels, number of unique colors, density, specific shapes).\n4.  Examine the differences between the \"target\" input strip (if one can be identified) and the expected output to understand the modification rule. Consider operations like pixel swapping, color changes, or geometric transformations applied *within* the strip boundaries.\n5.  Formulate a revised hypothesis that accommodates all examples.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n"

            "text": "**Observations from Metrics:**\n\n1.  **Strip Definition:** Horizontal strips separated by all-white rows seems correct. All examples have inputs with such strips, and the output grid always has the same dimensions (height and width) as one or more of the input strips.\n2.  **Selection Criterion:** The \"max non-white pixels, topmost tiebreak\" rule correctly identifies the target strip only in Example 1. In Examples 2, 3, and 4, while the *shape* and *non-white pixel count* of the output match the input strip(s) selected by the old rule, the *content* (pixel arrangement/colors) is different.\n3.  **Tie-breaking:** Example 1, 2 and 4 have ties in non-white pixel counts between strips. Example 1's output matched the *topmost* strip among the ties. Examples 2 and 4 *also* had ties, the old rule picked the topmost, but the output was different. This suggests the tie-breaking rule might be different, or the primary selection criterion isn't just the non-white count.\n4.  **Modification:** Since the output shape and non-white count often match an input strip, but the pixels differ, a modification *within* the selected strip is happening. The number of differing pixels is significant (14, 18, 22).\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation seems to involve:\n1.  Identifying all horizontal strips separated by white rows.\n2.  Selecting *one* target strip. The criterion might *not* be the maximum non-white pixel count, or the tie-breaking rule is different. Let's reconsider: maybe it's the *minimum* non-white count? Or perhaps the strip with the most *unique* colors? Or maybe related to the *sum* of pixel values? Or maybe the strip with the *most* white pixels *within* the strip? Let's quickly check the pixel counts again from the tool output.\n    *   Ex 1: Counts 18, 18, 18. Output matches strip 1 (topmost).\n    *   Ex 2: Counts 15, 15. Old rule picked strip 1. Output shape/count matches, content differs.\n    *   Ex 3: Count 20. Only one strip. Output shape/count matches, content differs.\n    *   Ex 4: Counts 21, 21. Old rule picked strip 1. Output shape/count matches, content differs.\n    The counts are often identical. The selection rule must be more nuanced or combined with the modification step.\n3.  Modifying the selected strip. What kind of modification could preserve the non-white pixel count but change the pattern?\n    *   Could it be swapping pixels?\n    *   Could it involve combining information from *multiple* strips if counts are tied?\n    *   Look at Example 2 again: Input Strip 1 and Strip 2 have 15 non-white pixels each. The output also has 15. Could the output be a pixel-wise combination (e.g., XOR, MAX, MIN) of Strip 1 and Strip 2?\n\nLet's test the combination idea on Example 2.\nInput Strip 1:\n"

However, it still fails to explain Examples 2, 3, and 4.\n- In Ex 2, it selects Strip 1, but the output is different (though Sum and Count match).\n- In Ex 3, it selects Strip 1, but the output is different (Sum differs, Count matches).\n- In Ex 4, it selects Strip 2 (the lower one due to higher sum), but the output is different (Sum differs, Count matches).\n\nCrucially, in Examples 3 and 4, the *sum* of the pixels in the output grid is different from the sum of the pixels in the strip selected by the Max Sum rule (or any input strip). However, the *non-white count* remains the same. This strongly implies a transformation that replaces some non-white pixels with other non-white pixels, or swaps positions of non-white pixels, rather than just adding or removing them.\n\nLet's reconsider Example 3. One strip, sum 59, count 20. Output sum 53, count 20. The sum decreased by 6. This could happen if, for example, a '5' was replaced by a '1' and a '3' by a '1' (change -4 + -2 = -6). Or a '5' and '1' were replaced by '0's (change -6) BUT this would decrease the count. So it must be color replacement.\n\nLook at Ex 3 Input Strip 1 vs Output:\nInput:\n"

Matches \"Max Sum, Max Non-White tiebreak, Topmost tiebreak\".\n  - example_2:\n      input_strips: 2 strips, all shape (3, 11).\n      strip_non_white_counts: [15, 15]\n      strip_sums: [30, 30]\n      output: Different content from both input strips.\n      output_non_white_count: 15 (matches input strips)\n      output_sum: 30 (matches input strips)\n      selection_rule_match: Does not match simple selection.

Max Sum rule selects Strip 2. Output differs. Implies modification.\n\nderived_properties:\n  - modification_preserves_non_white_count: Yes, in all examples where output differs from input strip, the non-white pixel count is preserved.\n  - modification_preserves_sum: No, Examples 3 and 4 show the sum changes.\n\nhypotheses:\n  - selection_criterion: Max Sum, with tiebreaks (Max Non-White count, then Topmost). This selects Strip 1 (Ex 1, 2, 3) and Strip 2 (Ex 4).\n  - transformation: The selected strip undergoes a modification that preserves the non-white pixel count but can alter the sum and pixel positions/colors. The exact modification rule is unclear but likely depends on the internal structure/patterns within the selected strip.\n```"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Strips:** Scan the input grid row by row. Identify rows composed entirely of the white color (0). These rows act as separators. Define horizontal \"strips\" as the contiguous blocks of rows between these separators (or between a separator and the top/bottom edge of the grid).\n2.  **Calculate Properties:** For each identified strip, calculate:\n    *   The sum of all pixel values within the strip.\n    *   The count of non-white pixels (pixels with values 1-9) within the strip.\n3.  **Select Target Strip:**\n    *   Find the maximum sum among all strips.\n    *   Identify all strips that have this maximum sum.\n    *   If there is only one strip with the maximum sum, select it.\n    *   If there is a tie in sums, compare the non-white pixel counts of the tied strips. Identify all strips among the tied ones that have the highest non-white pixel count.\n    *   If there is still a tie (same max sum and same max non-white count), select the strip that appears highest in the input grid (i.e., has the smallest starting row index).\n4.  **Transform Selected Strip:** (*This step is uncertain*) The selected strip is transformed into the output grid. This transformation preserves the shape (height and width) and the count of non-white pixels, but the arrangement and possibly the specific colors (values) of the non-white pixels may change, potentially altering the total sum of pixel values. The exact rules for this transformation are not yet determined but likely involve rearranging or modifying pixels based on local patterns or coordinates within the strip.\n5.  **Output:** The transformed strip is the final output grid."
