```python
"""
Identifies horizontal strips within the input grid, where strips are separated by rows consisting entirely of the white color (0). 
It then counts the number of non-white pixels (pixels with values 1-9) within each identified strip. 
Finally, it selects and returns the strip that contains the maximum number of non-white pixels. 
If multiple strips tie for the maximum count, the strip that appears highest (smallest starting row index) in the input grid is chosen.
