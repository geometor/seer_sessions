This implies the transformation is purely a rearrangement of existing pixels within the strip.\n*   **Example 3:** Sum differs (59 -> 53). Non-white count is the same (20). Specific color counts change: Blue (1) increases (4->6), Green (3) decreases (5->4), Gray (5) decreases (6->5). Red (2) count is unchanged (5). This implies rearrangement *and* color changes. The net change in sum is -6. (Change: +2 * (1) - 1 * (3) - 1 * (5) = 2 - 3 - 5 = -6). This matches the sum difference.\n*   **Example 4:** Sum differs (58 -> 57). Non-white count is the same (21). Specific color counts change: Red (2) increases (5->6), Green (3) decreases (6->5). Blue (1) and Gray (5) counts are unchanged. This implies rearrangement *and* color changes.
