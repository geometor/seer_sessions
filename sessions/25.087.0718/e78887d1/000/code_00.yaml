Input Grid:
  - Structure: 2D array of integers (colors).
  - Features:
    - Contains horizontal separator rows (all white pixels, color 0).
    - Contains horizontal strips of content between separators or grid edges.
    - Strips contain various non-white pixels (colors 1-9).
    - May contain vertical separator columns (all white pixels) within strips, but these don't define the primary segmentation for this task.

Output Grid:
  - Structure: 2D array of integers (colors).
  - Relationship to Input: Is an exact copy of one of the horizontal strips from the input grid.

Transformation:
  - Type: Selection / Extraction.
  - Process:
    - Identify horizontal separator rows (all white).
    - Segment the input grid into horizontal strips based on these separators and grid edges.
    - Calculate the total count of non-white pixels within each strip.
    - Select the strip with the highest count of non-white pixels.
    - If there's a tie for the highest count, select the strip that appears highest (smallest starting row index) in the input grid.
  - Result: The selected horizontal strip becomes the output grid.
