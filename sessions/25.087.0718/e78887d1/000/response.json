Both input and output grids contain pixels of various colors (white, red, blue, green, gray).\n2.  **Separators:** The input grids feature distinct rows composed entirely of white pixels (color 0). These white rows appear to act as horizontal separators, dividing the grid content into distinct horizontal sections or \"strips\". There are also columns of white pixels, but the primary division seems horizontal.\n3.  **Content Blocks:** Between the white separator rows, there are strips containing patterns of non-white pixels. These patterns often look like smaller, roughly 3x3 shapes, sometimes separated by white columns.\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grid always corresponds exactly to one of the horizontal strips found in the input grid (specifically, the content between two horizontal separators, or between a grid edge and a separator).\n5.  **Selection Criteria:** Comparing the strips within each input grid, the strip selected for the output appears to be the one containing the *most* non-white pixels.\n    *   In `train_1`, the top strip (rows 1-3) has 15 non-white pixels, the middle (rows 5-7) has 12, and the bottom (rows 9-11) has 12. The output matches the top strip.\n    *   In `train_2`, the top strip (rows 1-3) has 13 non-white pixels, and the bottom strip (rows 5-7) has 14. The output matches the bottom strip.\n    *   In `train_3`, there's only one strip (rows 1-3) with 18 non-white pixels. The output matches this strip.\n    *   In `train_4`, the top strip (rows 1-3) has 19 non-white pixels, and the bottom strip (rows 5-7) has 20. The output matches the bottom strip.\n6.  **Tie-breaking:** The examples provided do not present a case where multiple strips have the same maximum number of non-white pixels. However, a reasonable assumption (common in ARC) would be to select the topmost strip among those tied for the maximum count.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Include the conceptual separators existing just before the first row and just after the last row.\n2.  Define horizontal strips as the contiguous blocks of rows located between consecutive horizontal separators (or between a grid edge and the nearest separator).\n3.  For each horizontal strip:\n    a.  Initialize a counter to zero.\n    b.  Iterate through all pixels within the strip.\n    c.  If a pixel's color is not white (i.e., value > 0), increment the counter.\n    d.  Store the final count associated with this strip.\n4.  Find the maximum count among all calculated strip counts.\n5.  Identify the first horizontal strip (the one starting at the lowest row index) that has this maximum count.\n6.  Extract this identified horizontal strip completely, preserving its dimensions and pixel values. This extracted grid is the output."
