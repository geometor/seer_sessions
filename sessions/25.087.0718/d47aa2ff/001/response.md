def transform(input_grid):
    """
    The input grid is divided into two halves (left and right) by a central vertical gray (5) line. 
    The output grid has the dimensions of the left half. 
    The transformation involves comparing corresponding pixels in the left and right halves.

    1. Determine the dimensions of the input grid (height, width).
    2. Identify the central column index (width // 2).
    3. Create the output grid by taking a copy of the left half of the input grid (columns 0 to width // 2 - 1).
    4. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) in the output grid (which corresponds to the pixel (r, c) in the left half of the input).
    5. For each pixel (r, c):
       a. Get the value of the pixel in the left half: val_l = input_grid[r, c].
       b. Get the value of the corresponding pixel in the right half: val_r = input_grid[r, width // 2 + 1 + c].
       c. Compare val_l and val_r:
          i. If val_l is non-background (not 0) and val_r is background (0), set the output pixel output_grid[r, c] to red (2).
          ii. If val_l is background (0) and val_r is non-background (not 0), set the output pixel output_grid[r, c] to blue (1).
          iii. Otherwise (if both are background, or both are non-background), the output pixel output_grid[r, c] retains its original value from the left half.
    6. Return the modified output grid.
