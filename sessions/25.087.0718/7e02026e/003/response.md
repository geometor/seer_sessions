"""
Identify contiguous regions of white pixels (0) that are effectively "enclosed". 
An enclosed region is one where the white pixels cannot reach the boundary of the grid by moving only through other white pixels. 
Change all white pixels within these enclosed regions to green (3). Other pixels remain unchanged.

The process involves:
1. Copy the input grid to create the output grid.
2. Find all white pixels (0) that are connected to the grid boundary by a path consisting only of white pixels.
3. Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all boundary white pixels. The BFS can only traverse through white pixels. Mark all reachable white pixels during the BFS.
4. Iterate through the grid. Any white pixel that was *not* marked as reachable from the boundary (via a path of white pixels) is considered enclosed.
5. Change the color of these enclosed white pixels to green (3) in the output grid. Non-white pixels and non-enclosed white pixels remain unchanged.
