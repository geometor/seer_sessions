Other pixels remain unchanged.\n\nThe process involves:\n1. Copy the input grid to create the output grid.\n2. Find all white pixels (0) that are connected to the grid boundary by a path consisting only of white pixels.\n3. Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all boundary white pixels. The BFS can only traverse through white pixels. Mark all reachable white pixels during the BFS.\n4. Iterate through the grid. Any white pixel that was *not* marked as reachable from the boundary (via a path of white pixels) is considered enclosed.\n5. Change the color of these enclosed white pixels to green (3) in the output grid.
