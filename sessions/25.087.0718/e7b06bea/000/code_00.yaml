elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
  - object: reference_line
    color: gray (5)
    location: always column 0
    shape: vertical line
  - object: data_lines
    color: various non-white, non-gray colors (e.g., green, blue, maroon, azure, magenta, orange, red, yellow)
    location: one or more contiguous columns to the right of the reference_line, separated by a gap of white columns
    shape: vertical lines forming a rectangular block
properties:
  - grid_dimensions: variable height and width
  - gap: white space between reference_line (col 0) and the leftmost data_line
relationships:
  - data_lines are always to the right of the reference_line.
  - data_lines maintain their relative horizontal order during the transformation.
actions:
  - identify: locate the reference_line (gray, column 0).
  - identify: locate the block of contiguous data_lines.
  - measure: determine the column index (F) of the leftmost data_line.
  - calculate: determine the new starting column for the data_lines block as F - 1.
  - transform: shift the entire data_lines block left by one column.
  - update: replace the original locations of the shifted data_lines with the background color (white).
  - preserve: keep the reference_line in its original position (column 0).
