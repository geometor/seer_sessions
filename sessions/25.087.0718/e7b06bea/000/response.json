To the right of this gray line, separated by one or more columns of white (0), there are one or more contiguous vertical lines of other colors.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the gray (5) line at column 0. The other colored vertical lines from the input are shifted leftwards. They remain contiguous and maintain their original relative horizontal order. The key change is the reduction of the white space between the gray line and the block of other colored lines. Specifically, the gap seems to be reduced by exactly one column width.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the block of non-gray, non-white vertical lines and shifting this entire block one column position to the left. The original positions occupied by these shifted lines become white (0). The gray line at column 0 remains unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the gray vertical line in the input grid (it will be at column 0). Copy this gray line to column 0 of the output grid.\n3.  Identify all columns in the input grid, starting from column 1, that contain colors other than white (0) or gray (5). These form the 'data lines'.\n4.  Find the minimum column index (`F`) among these data lines.\n5.  Determine the target starting column (`T`) for the shifted data lines in the output grid by calculating `T = F - 1`.\n6.  Iterate through the identified data line columns from the input grid, maintaining their relative order. For each data line column found at input index `C`, copy its contents (the vertical line of color) to the corresponding output column index `T + (C - F)`.\n7.  The output grid now contains the gray line at column 0 and the shifted data lines starting at column `T`. All other cells remain white (0)."
