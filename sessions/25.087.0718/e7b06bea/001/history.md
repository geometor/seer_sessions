Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

The input and output grids consistently feature vertical lines of solid colors against a white background.
1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid has a gray (5) vertical line located at the leftmost column (column 0). To the right of this gray line, separated by one or more columns of white (0), there are one or more contiguous vertical lines of other colors.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the gray (5) line at column 0. The other colored vertical lines from the input are shifted leftwards. They remain contiguous and maintain their original relative horizontal order. The key change is the reduction of the white space between the gray line and the block of other colored lines. Specifically, the gap seems to be reduced by exactly one column width.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the block of non-gray, non-white vertical lines and shifting this entire block one column position to the left. The original positions occupied by these shifted lines become white (0). The gray line at column 0 remains unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
  - object: reference_line
    color: gray (5)
    location: always column 0
    shape: vertical line
  - object: data_lines
    color: various non-white, non-gray colors (e.g., green, blue, maroon, azure, magenta, orange, red, yellow)
    location: one or more contiguous columns to the right of the reference_line, separated by a gap of white columns
    shape: vertical lines forming a rectangular block
properties:
  - grid_dimensions: variable height and width
  - gap: white space between reference_line (col 0) and the leftmost data_line
relationships:
  - data_lines are always to the right of the reference_line.
  - data_lines maintain their relative horizontal order during the transformation.
actions:
  - identify: locate the reference_line (gray, column 0).
  - identify: locate the block of contiguous data_lines.
  - measure: determine the column index (F) of the leftmost data_line.
  - calculate: determine the new starting column for the data_lines block as F - 1.
  - transform: shift the entire data_lines block left by one column.
  - update: replace the original locations of the shifted data_lines with the background color (white).
  - preserve: keep the reference_line in its original position (column 0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the gray vertical line in the input grid (it will be at column 0). Copy this gray line to column 0 of the output grid.
3.  Identify all columns in the input grid, starting from column 1, that contain colors other than white (0) or gray (5). These form the 'data lines'.
4.  Find the minimum column index (`F`) among these data lines.
5.  Determine the target starting column (`T`) for the shifted data lines in the output grid by calculating `T = F - 1`.
6.  Iterate through the identified data line columns from the input grid, maintaining their relative order. For each data line column found at input index `C`, copy its contents (the vertical line of color) to the corresponding output column index `T + (C - F)`.
7.  The output grid now contains the gray line at column 0 and the shifted data lines starting at column `T`. All other cells remain white (0).
