Okay, let's analyze the task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** Each input grid contains a white background (0) and a single vertical line of gray pixels (5). This gray line always starts from the top row (row 0).
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input.
    *   The original gray line remains in the same position.
    *   New colored areas appear to the left and right of the gray line.
    *   Pixels to the left of the gray line are colored azure (8).
    *   Pixels to the right of the gray line are colored magenta (6).
    *   The background remains white (0) where no other colors are placed.
3.  **Structure:** The azure and magenta form shapes resembling triangles or columns that decrease in height as they move away horizontally from the central gray line. Specifically, the height of the colored column (azure or magenta) decreases by 2 for every 1 column step away from the gray line. The height of the azure columns (left side) is calculated differently from the magenta columns (right side) relative to the gray line's height.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  - Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 7x14, 8x11, 8x14)
  - BackgroundColor: white (0)
InputObjects:
  - Object: GrayLine
    Color: gray (5)
    Shape: Vertical line
    Position: Starts at row 0, fixed column index (C_gray)
    Height: Variable length (L)
OutputObjects:
  - Object: GrayLine
    Color: gray (5)
    Shape: Vertical line
    Position: Same as input (column C_gray, rows 0 to L-1)
    Height: L
  - Object: AzureArea
    Color: azure (8)
    Shape: Columnar, height decreases with distance from GrayLine
    Position: Columns left of C_gray (0 to C_gray-1)
    Extent: Height H in column c is max(0, L + 2 * (C_gray - c)), filling rows 0 to H-1
  - Object: MagentaArea
    Color: magenta (6)
    Shape: Columnar, height decreases with distance from GrayLine
    Position: Columns right of C_gray (C_gray+1 onwards)
    Extent: Height H in column c is max(0, L - 2 * (c - C_gray)), filling rows 0 to H-1
Relationships:
  - GrayLine position determines the location of AzureArea and MagentaArea.
  - GrayLine height (L) and column index (C_gray) determine the height of each column in AzureArea and MagentaArea.
Transformation:
  - Rule: For each column 'c', calculate a height 'H' based on the GrayLine's properties (L, C_gray) and the column's distance from C_gray. Fill the column 'c' from row 0 up to row H-1 with a specific color (azure if c < C_gray, gray if c == C_gray, magenta if c > C_gray).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the vertical gray line (color 5) in the input grid. Note its column index (`C_gray`) and its length (`L`), which is the number of gray pixels.
2.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
3.  Iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to the grid width minus 1.
4.  For the current column `c`:
    a.  If `c` is less than `C_gray` (left of the gray line):
        i.  Calculate the height `H = L + 2 * (C_gray - c)`.
        ii. Set the color `Col = 8` (azure).
    b.  If `c` is equal to `C_gray` (the column of the gray line):
        i.  Set the height `H = L`.
        ii. Set the color `Col = 5` (gray).
    c.  If `c` is greater than `C_gray` (right of the gray line):
        i.  Calculate the height `H = L - 2 * (c - C_gray)`.
        ii. Set the color `Col = 6` (magenta).
5.  Ensure the calculated height `H` is not negative; if it is, set `H = 0`.
6.  In the output grid, fill the cells in column `c` from row 0 up to (but not including) row `H` with the determined color `Col`. Make sure not to fill beyond the grid's bottom boundary.
7.  After iterating through all columns, the output grid is complete.
