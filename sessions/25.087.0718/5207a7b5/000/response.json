This gray line always starts from the top row (row 0).\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input.\n    *   The original gray line remains in the same position.\n    *   New colored areas appear to the left and right of the gray line.\n    *   Pixels to the left of the gray line are colored azure (8).\n    *   Pixels to the right of the gray line are colored magenta (6).\n    *   The background remains white (0) where no other colors are placed.\n3.  **Structure:** The azure and magenta form shapes resembling triangles or columns that decrease in height as they move away horizontally from the central gray line. Specifically, the height of the colored column (azure or magenta) decreases by 2 for every 1 column step away from the gray line. The height of the azure columns (left side) is calculated differently from the magenta columns (right side) relative to the gray line's height.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If `c` is greater than `C_gray` (right of the gray line):\n        i.  Calculate the height `H = L - 2 * (c - C_gray)`.\n        ii. Set the color `Col = 6` (magenta).\n5.  Ensure the calculated height `H` is not negative; if it is, set `H = 0`.\n6.  In the output grid, fill the cells in column `c` from row 0 up to (but not including) row `H` with the determined color `Col`. Make sure not to fill beyond the grid's bottom boundary.\n7.
