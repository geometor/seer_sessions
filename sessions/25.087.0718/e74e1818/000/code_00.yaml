task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  background_color: white (0).
  object_definition: Connected component of non-background pixels of the same color.

objects:
  - id: object_1
    description: A connected component of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (1-9).
      - connectivity: Pixels are connected horizontally or vertically.
      - location: Defined by the set of coordinates it occupies.
      - vertical_extent: The range of row indices spanned by the object (min_row to max_row).

actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    description: Find all distinct connected components of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_objects

  - name: determine_vertical_extent
    description: For a given object, find the minimum and maximum row index it occupies.
    inputs: object
    outputs: min_row, max_row

  - name: extract_row_slice
    description: Get the horizontal rows from the input grid corresponding to the vertical extent of an object.
    inputs: input_grid, min_row, max_row
    outputs: row_slice (a list or array of rows)

  - name: reverse_row_order
    description: Reverse the order of rows within the extracted slice.
    inputs: row_slice
    outputs: reversed_row_slice

  - name: place_reversed_slice
    description: Place the reversed row slice into the output grid at the original vertical extent.
    inputs: output_grid, reversed_row_slice, min_row, max_row
    outputs: modified_output_grid

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects occupy specific rows and columns in the grid.
  - type: processing
    description: Each identified object is processed independently. The transformation on one object does not affect others directly.
  - type: input_output_mapping
    description: The output grid is constructed by applying the row-reversal transformation for each object's vertical extent onto an initially white grid.

goal:
  description: Vertically flip the rows within the vertical bounds of each distinct object found in the input grid.
