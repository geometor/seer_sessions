            "text": "Okay, the symmetry hypothesis failed badly. The code execution reveals many mismatches between whether an object *is* vertically symmetric and whether its corresponding rows *are* actually flipped in the expected output.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. The previous code identified *objects* (connected components) and flipped rows based on their vertical extents. The failures indicate this is not the correct approach.\n\n**New Observations & Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Rows, Not Objects:** The transformation seems to operate on horizontal bands (groups of rows) rather than being determined by individual object properties like symmetry.\n2.  **Identify the Bands:** Look at which groups of rows are flipped together.\n    *   Example 1: Rows (1, 2, 3) [Red], Rows (4, 5) [Green], Rows (9, 10, 11) [Yellow] are flipped. Rows (6, 7, 8) [Blue] are NOT flipped.\n    *   Example 2: Rows (1, 2) [Blue], Rows (4, 5, 6) [Gray], Rows (7, 8) [Red] are flipped. Row 3 [Azure] and Row 9 [Green] are NOT flipped.\n    *   Example 3: Rows (1, 2) [Maroon], Rows (4, 5) [Green] are flipped. Row 3 [Yellow] is NOT flipped.\n3.  **What defines these bands?**\n    *   They seem to correspond to the vertical extent of *something*. Let's reconsider objects.\n    *   Maybe it's not individual objects, but *groups* of objects or the *overall pattern* within a certain row range.\n    *   In Ex 1, rows 1-3 contain only Red pixels (and background). Rows 4-5 contain only Green. Rows 6-8 contain only Blue. Rows 9-11 contain only Yellow.\n    *   In Ex 2, rows 1-2 contain only Blue. Row 3 contains only Azure. Rows 4-6 contain only Gray. Rows 7-8 contain only Red. Row 9 contains only Green.\n    *   In Ex 3, rows 1-2 contain only Maroon. Row 3 contains only Yellow. Rows 4-5 contain only Green.\n    *   **Hypothesis Refined:** Find maximal vertical bands (contiguous rows) where all non-background pixels within that band belong to the *same color*.\n4.  **What determines if a band is flipped?**\n    *   Ex 1: Red, Green, Yellow bands flipped. Blue band not flipped.\n    *   Ex 2: Blue, Gray, Red bands flipped. Azure, Green bands not flipped.\n    *   Ex 3: Maroon, Green bands flipped. Yellow band not flipped.\n    *   Let's re-examine the objects *within* these bands and their symmetry.\n        *   Ex 1, Blue band (rows 6-8): Contains one object which *is* vertically symmetric. Band NOT flipped.\n        *   Ex 1, Red band (rows 1-3): Contains multiple objects. Let's consider the combined pattern in rows 1-3. Is *that* pattern vertically symmetric?\n            Input[1:4,:]:\n            "

All are confirmed non-symmetric when checking the full slice, and all corresponding bands ARE flipped.\n\n*   **Final Hypothesis:**\n    1.  Identify maximal vertical bands (contiguous sets of rows) such that all non-background pixels within the band share the same color.\n    2.  For each such band, extract the corresponding slice from the input grid.\n    3.  Check if this extracted slice is vertically symmetrical (i.e., `np.array_equal(slice, np.flipud(slice))`).\n    4.  If the slice is NOT vertically symmetrical, replace that slice in the output grid with the vertically flipped version of the slice.\n    5.  If the slice IS vertically symmetrical, copy the original slice to the output grid (or leave it unchanged if starting with a copy).\n\nThis hypothesis seems to cover all examples correctly.\n\n**Strategy Re-Cap:** The initial code's failure was applying the flip based on individual object extents and potentially incorrect symmetry checks. The refined strategy identifies monolithic color bands, checks the vertical symmetry of the *entire band's pattern*, and flips the band *only* if it's not symmetric.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code correctly identified objects but failed because its core logic (flipping rows based on individual object extents) did not match the underlying task rule. The failures on Examples 1 and 3, and the specific analysis of which rows were flipped vs. not flipped in the expected outputs, revealed that the transformation operates on larger vertical \"bands\" defined by color, and the decision to flip depends on the vertical symmetry of the *entire pattern within that band*. The previous code's symmetry check (if it existed implicitly or explicitly) was likely applied incorrectly or at the wrong level (individual objects vs. full bands). The new strategy involves identifying these color-based row bands and checking the symmetry of the pixel pattern within each band to decide whether to apply a vertical flip to those rows.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nBased on the code execution and manual analysis:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Bands (Color: Rows)                | Flipped Bands (Expected) | Symmetric Bands (Pattern) | Non-Symmetric Bands (Pattern) |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------ | :---------------------------- |\n| 1       | (13, 13)    | (13, 13)     | Red: 1-3, Green: 4-5, Blue: 6-8, Yellow: 9-11 | Red, Green, Yellow       | Blue                      | Red, Green, Yellow            |\n| 2       | (11, 11)    | (11, 11)     | Blue: 1-2, Azure: 3, Gray: 4-6, Red: 7-8, Green: 9 | Blue, Gray, Red          | Azure, Green              | Blue, Gray, Red               |\n| 3       | (7, 7)      | (7, 7)       | Maroon: 1-2, Yellow: 3, Green: 4-5 | Maroon, Green            | Yellow                    | Maroon, Green                 |\n\n*   **Observation:** A band of rows is flipped if and only if the pattern of pixels within that band (across the full grid width) is NOT vertically symmetric.

Iterate through the rows of the input grid to identify maximal contiguous vertical \"bands\". A band is defined as a sequence of one or more rows where all non-background (non-zero) pixels within those rows have the *same* color. Bands are separated by rows containing only background pixels or rows where the non-background color changes.\n3.  For each identified band:\n    a.  Determine the start row (`min_row`) and end row (`max_row`) of the band.\n    b.  Extract the rectangular slice of the input grid corresponding to this band (from `min_row` to `max_row`, covering all columns).\n    c.  Check if this extracted slice is vertically symmetrical. This means checking if the slice is identical to the result of flipping the slice vertically (top-to-bottom).\n    d.  If the slice is **not** vertically symmetrical, then vertically flip the extracted slice and place this flipped version into the output grid at the corresponding rows (`min_row` to `max_row`).\n    e.  If the slice **is** vertically symmetrical, do nothing (the output grid already contains the original, unflipped rows from the initial copy).\n4.  Return the modified output grid.## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code attempted to solve the task by identifying individual connected objects and flipping the rows spanning their vertical extent. This approach failed on two out of three training examples. The analysis of the failed examples, compared with the successful one, revealed that the transformation is not determined by individual objects but by larger horizontal \"bands\" defined by color. The key determining factor for whether a band's rows are flipped is the vertical symmetry of the *entire pattern* within that band, not the symmetry of individual objects it might contain. The previous code applied flips based on object extents, leading to incorrect results when a band contained multiple objects or when a symmetric object existed within a band that should not have been flipped (like the blue object in Example 1 or the yellow object in Example 3).\n\nThe strategy moving forward is to:\n1.  Identify maximal contiguous vertical bands where all non-background pixels share the same color.\n2.  For each band, check if the pattern within the full grid slice corresponding to those rows is vertically symmetric.\n3.  Flip the rows of the band in the output grid *only if* the band's pattern is *not* vertically symmetric.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n"
