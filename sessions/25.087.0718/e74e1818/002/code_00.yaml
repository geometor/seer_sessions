task_description: Vertically flip horizontal bands of the grid based on color and symmetry.
definitions:
  band: A maximal contiguous set of rows where all non-background pixels share the same color.
  vertical_symmetry: A grid slice is vertically symmetric if it is identical to itself when flipped top-to-bottom.
processing_steps:
  - step: Identify all maximal vertical bands based on uniform non-background color.
    details: Iterate through rows, grouping consecutive rows that contain only pixels of background (0) or a single specific color (1-9).
  - step: For each identified band:
    - sub_step: Extract the grid slice corresponding to the band's rows.
    - sub_step: Check if the extracted slice is vertically symmetric.
    - sub_step: If the slice is NOT vertically symmetric, perform a vertical flip (top-to-bottom reversal) on the rows of this slice.
    - sub_step: If the slice IS vertically symmetric, leave the rows unchanged.
  - step: Construct the output grid by applying the flips (or lack thereof) to the corresponding row bands from the input grid.

    bands:
      - color: Red, rows: [1, 2, 3], symmetric: false, action: flip
      - color: Green, rows: [4, 5], symmetric: false, action: flip
      - color: Blue, rows: [6, 7, 8], symmetric: true, action: keep
      - color: Yellow, rows: [9, 10, 11], symmetric: false, action: flip
