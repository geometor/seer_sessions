The `tool_code` output *does* seem to match the *expected output* for the vertical pixels (they are in column 9). Let's re-check the provided initial `Transformed Output` log vs the `tool_code` output.\n\n    *Initial Log's Transformed Output (Example 3):* Vertically aligned pixels are in col 9. Horizontally aligned pixels are in row 3, but look shifted right by 1 (cols 1,2,3,4 -> row 3 cols 1,2,3,4 ; cols 10,11,12 -> row 3 cols 10,11,12) - Wait, I misread the initial log output completely. Let me diff it carefully.\n\n    *Initial Log's Transformed Output:*\n    "

            "text": "\n    Okay, the `tool_code` output (which reflects the actual code execution) is different from BOTH the initial log's `Transformed Output` *and* the `Expected Output`.\n\n    The `tool_code` output correctly moved the *horizontally* aligned pixels (from row 5 to row 3). It *incorrectly* moved the *vertically* aligned pixels (from column 6) to column 9 (c+3), while the expected output has them staying in column 8.\n\n    Let's re-examine the expected outputs carefully.\n    Example 1: Vertically aligned (col 4) -> col 7 (4+3=7). Horizontally aligned (row 5) -> row 2 (bbox.min_row). Matches logic.\n    Example 2: Vertically aligned (col 5) -> col 8 (5+3=8). Horizontally aligned (row 6) -> row 3 (bbox.min_row). Matches logic.\n    Example 3: Vertically aligned (col 6) -> col 8 (Expected) vs col 9 (Code). Horizontally aligned (row 5) -> row 3 (bbox.min_row). Matches logic.\n\n    **Conclusion:** The issue lies *only* in the vertical movement rule for Example 3. The code consistently applies `c+3`, but for Example 3, the expected shift is only `c+2` (from 6 to 8). Examples 1 and 2 both follow the `c+3` rule.\n\n    Why the difference? Is there something unique about Example 3?\n    *   Input Grid Size: 12x12 (Same as others)\n    *   Main Shape Color: 3 (Green)\n    *   Active Color: 4 (Yellow)\n    *   Bounding Box: rows 3-7, cols 4-8\n    *   Vertical Pixels: col 6\n    *   Horizontal Pixels: row 5\n\n    Is the shift amount related to the dimensions or position of the bounding box?\n    *   Example 1: BBox (2-7, 2-7). Vertical shift = 3. `bbox.min_col = 2`.\n    *   Example 2: BBox (3-9, 2-8). Vertical shift = 3. `bbox.min_col = 2`.\n    *   Example 3: BBox (3-7, 4-8). Vertical shift = 2 (Expected). `bbox.min_col = 4`.\n\n    Hypothesis: The vertical shift amount is `bbox.min_col - 1`?\n    *   Example 1: `2 - 1 = 1` (Incorrect, shift is 3)\n    Hypothesis: The vertical shift amount is related to the *width* of the bounding box?\n    *   Example 1: Width = 7-2+1 = 6. Shift = 3.\n    *   Example 2: Width = 8-2+1 = 7. Shift = 3.\n    *   Example 3: Width = 8-4+1 = 5. Shift = 2 (Expected).\n\n    This doesn't look consistent either. `Width / 2` rounded? Ex1: 6/2=3. Ex2: 7/2=3.5->3? Ex3: 5/2=2.5->2? This seems plausible. Let's assume integer division or floor.\n    *   Example 1: `floor(6/2) = 3`. Matches.\n    *   Example 2: `floor(7/2) = 3`. Matches.\n    *   Example 3: `floor(5/2) = 2`. Matches.\n\n    Revised Hypothesis: The vertical shift for active pixels outside the bounding box but aligned with its columns is `floor(bbox_width / 2)`.\n\n    Let's re-evaluate the horizontal movement. It moves to `bbox.min_row`. This seems consistent across all examples.\n\n    Final check on the logic:\n    1. Find the largest non-background object (main shape).\n    2. Find its bounding box.\n    3. Find the 'active' color (present both inside and outside the bbox).\n    4. Remove active color pixels from *inside* the bbox.\n    5. Move active color pixels from *outside* the bbox:\n        a. If the pixel is in the same column range as the bbox (vertically aligned): move it right by `floor(bbox_width / 2)` columns.\n        b. If the pixel is in the same row range as the bbox (horizontally aligned): move it to the `bbox.min_row` row, keeping its original column.\n\nThis revised logic seems to fit all three examples.## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code successfully implements the transformation logic derived from the first example for the first two training pairs. However, it fails on the third example.\n\nThe core logic identifies a 'main shape', its bounding box, and an 'active color' present both inside and outside this box. It then removes the active color from inside the box and relocates the active color pixels from outside.\n\nThe failure on Example 3 indicates that the rule for relocating the *vertically aligned* active color pixels (those outside the box but sharing columns with it) was not general enough. The initial code used a fixed shift of +3 columns. The results from Example 3 show that the required shift was +2 columns.\n\nBy comparing the bounding boxes across the examples, a new hypothesis emerges: the vertical shift distance might be related to the width of the bounding box. Specifically, `floor(bbox_width / 2)` seems to match the required shift (3, 3, and 2) for the three examples respectively. The rule for moving horizontally aligned pixels (to the `bbox.min_row`) appears consistent.\n\nThe strategy will be to refine the natural language program and subsequently the code to incorporate this dynamic calculation for the vertical shift based on the bounding box width.\n\n## Metrics Gathering (Example 3)\n\nBased on the `tool_code` execution:\n\n*   **Input Grid (Example 3):** 12x12\n*   **Main Shape Color:** 3 (green)\n*   **Main Shape Pixels:** A '+' shape.\n*   **Bounding Box (bbox):** `BoundingBox(min_row=3, max_row=7, min_col=4, max_col=8)`\n    *   `bbox_width = max_col - min_col + 1 = 8 - 4 + 1 = 5`\n    *   `bbox_height = max_row - min_row + 1 = 7 - 3 + 1 = 5`\n    *   `floor(bbox_width / 2) = floor(5 / 2) = 2`\n*   **Active Color:** 4 (yellow) - Found both inside and outside the bbox.\n*   **Active Pixels Inside BBox:** `[{'r': 4, 'c': 6}, {'r': 5, 'c': 5}, {'r': 5, 'c': 6}, {'r': 5, 'c': 7}, {'r': 6, 'c': 6}]`\n*   **Active Pixels Outside BBox (Vertically Aligned):** Column 6, rows 0, 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11.\n    *   Original Coordinates: `(r, 6)` for r in {0,1,2,8,9,10,11}\n    *   Expected Target Coordinates: `(r, 6 + floor(bbox_width/2))` => `(r, 6 + 2)` => `(r, 8)`\n*   **Active Pixels Outside BBox (Horizontally Aligned):** Row 5, columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11.\n    *   Original Coordinates: `(5, c)` for c in {0,1,2,3,9,10,11}\n    *   Expected Target Coordinates: `(bbox.min_row, c)` => `(3, c)`\n*   **Code Output Discrepancy:** The previous code calculated the vertical shift as `c + 3`, resulting in target column `6 + 3 = 9`. The expected output requires a target column of `8`.\n\n## YAML Documentation of Facts\n\n"
