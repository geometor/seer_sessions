The background is white (0).\n    *   Another color (green, azure, or yellow respectively) appears as pixels both inside the boundary of the main shape and outside the boundary. Let's call this the \"active color\".\n    *   The active color pixels outside the main shape form simple linear patterns, either extending vertically within the columns spanned by the main shape, or horizontally within the rows spanned by the main shape.\n    *   In the output grid, the main shape remains unchanged in color and position.\n    *   The active color pixels that were *inside* the main shape in the input are removed (changed to white) in the output.\n    *   The active color pixels that were *outside* the main shape in the input are moved to new locations in the output. Their original locations become white.\n    *   The movement depends on the alignment relative to the main shape's bounding box:\n        *   Active pixels in columns spanned by the main shape (but rows outside it) move 3 columns to the right.\n        *   Active pixels in rows spanned by the main shape (but columns outside it) move vertically to align with the top edge (minimum row) of the main shape.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Identify the main solid shape in the input grid (the largest contiguous object of a single color, excluding the background color 0/white). Note its color.\n    2.  Identify the \"active color\" - this is the color that appears in pixels both *inside* the area covered by the main shape and *outside* it.\n    3.  Determine the bounding box of the main shape (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column).\n    4.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.\n    5.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at position (row `r`, column `c`).\n    6.  If the pixel's color is the active color:\n        a.  Check if the pixel's position (r, c) is within the bounding box of the main shape (`min_row <= r <= max_row` AND `min_col <= c <= max_col`).\n        b.

Change the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the *output* grid to white (0) (erase from original position).\n            ii.

Change the color of the pixel at the calculated target position in the *output* grid to the active color.\n    7.  Pixels that are part of the main shape or the background (not the active color) remain unchanged from the input grid (this is implicitly handled by initializing the output grid as a copy and only modifying active color pixels).\n    8.
