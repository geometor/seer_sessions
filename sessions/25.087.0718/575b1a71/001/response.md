"""
Transforms the input grid by replacing white (0) pixels with specific colors based on the column they appear in. 
The replacement color depends on the sorted order of columns containing white pixels: 
the first such column's white pixels become blue (1), the second red (2), the third green (3), and the fourth yellow (4).
Other pixels remain unchanged.
