This color appears unchanged between input and output.\n3.  **Target Pixels:** The input grids contain scattered white (0) pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** In the output grids, the white (0) pixels are replaced by other colors: blue (1), red (2), green (3), or yellow (4).\n5.  **Positional Dependency:** The color assigned to replace a white pixel depends on the column it resides in. Specifically, it relates to the *order* of columns containing white pixels.\n6.  **Columnar Coloring:** All white pixels within the same column are replaced by the same color.\n7.  **Color Sequence:** The columns containing white pixels are identified. These columns, when sorted by their index (left-to-right), are assigned colors sequentially: the first column gets blue (1), the second gets red (2), the third gets green (3), and the fourth gets yellow (4). This pattern suggests a mapping based on the ordinal position of the column among those containing white pixels.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
