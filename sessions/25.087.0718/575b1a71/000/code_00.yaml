grid_dimensions:
  - input_height: 10
    input_width: 10
    output_height: 10
    output_width: 10
pixels:
  - background:
      color: gray (5)
      behavior: remains unchanged
  - target:
      color: white (0)
      behavior: replaced by a new color based on column position
  - replacement_colors:
      - blue (1)
      - red (2)
      - green (3)
      - yellow (4)
transformation:
  - type: pixel_replacement
  - scope: affects only white (0) pixels
  - logic: based on column index and order
relationships:
  - all white pixels in the same column receive the same replacement color.
  - the specific replacement color depends on the sorted order of columns containing white pixels.
rule_details:
  - identify all columns containing at least one white (0) pixel.
  - sort the indices of these columns in ascending order.
  - map the first sorted column index to blue (1).
  - map the second sorted column index to red (2).
  - map the third sorted column index to green (3).
  - map the fourth sorted column index to yellow (4).
  - replace each white (0) pixel with the color mapped to its column index.
