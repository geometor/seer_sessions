Inside this frame, at specific locations (often corners relative to the frame's internal area), there are single pixels of other colors (excluding blue and white). Outside the blue frame, there are distinct shapes (connected components of non-white pixels) corresponding in color to the single pixels found inside the frame. The output grid contains only these shapes from outside the frame, rearranged. The arrangement of the shapes in the output grid mirrors the relative spatial arrangement of their corresponding single-colored \"key\" pixels within the blue frame. The shapes in the output maintain their original structure and are separated by a single row/column of white (0) pixels.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
