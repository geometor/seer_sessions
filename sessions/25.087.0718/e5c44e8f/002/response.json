            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core mechanic: locating a single green (3) pixel in the input and drawing a fixed pattern centered on that location in the output. It also correctly identified the conditional rule regarding the last row based on the number of non-white pixels in the *input*.\n\nHowever, the code failed because the specific 9x9 pattern used to represent the digit '3' was incorrect. The pattern hardcoded in the `transform` function does not match the pattern observed in the expected outputs of the training examples. Additionally, there were minor discrepancies in how the pattern placement interacted with existing pixels in some cases, although simple overwriting seems to be the intended behavior based on the expected outputs.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is:\n1.  Accurately determine the correct 9x9 pattern from the provided example outputs.\n2.  Verify how this pattern interacts with pre-existing non-white pixels (it appears to overwrite them).\n3.  Confirm the conditional logic for filling the last row.\n4.  Update the natural language program and subsequent code to reflect the correct pattern and logic.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's extract the correct pattern by analyzing Example 1, where the input green pixel is at (4, 5) and the output pattern should be centered there. The pattern spans rows `4 - 4 = 0` to `4 + 4 = 8` and columns `5 - 4 = 1` to `5 + 4 = 9`.\n\n"

            "text": "**Revised Analysis based on Code Output:**\n\n1.  **Pattern Discrepancy**: The code output confirms the pattern extracted from Example 1's expected output. It also confirms that the pattern used in the previous code differed only at the center pixel `(4, 4)` (index-wise) - the previous code used white (0), while the correct pattern uses green (3).\n2.  **Pattern Consistency Issue?**: Crucially, the pattern extracted from Example 2's expected output *does not match* the pattern from Example 1. This contradicts the initial assumption of a single, fixed pattern being drawn. Let's re-examine Example 2. The green pixel is at (5, 5). The pattern should be drawn centered there, covering rows `5-4=1` to `5+4=9` and columns `5-4=1` to `5+4=9`. The extracted `correct_pattern_ex2` above seems to show interference from the original red pixels. This suggests the interaction is not simple overwriting of *all* pixels by the pattern. Perhaps only *background* (white) pixels are overwritten by the pattern, while existing non-background pixels are preserved? Let's test this hypothesis.\n\n    *   Input Ex2, Pixel (3, 8) = Red (2). Output Ex2, Pixel (3, 8) = Green (3). Hypothesis fails - Red was overwritten.\n    *   Input Ex2, Pixel (8, 2) = Red (2). Output Ex2, Pixel (8, 2) = Red (2). Pattern area is rows 1-9, cols 1-9. This pixel is at (8, 2), which is within the pattern's bounding box. The expected pattern pixel at relative index `(8-1, 2-1) = (7, 1)` is `0` (white background in the \"ideal\" pattern derived from Ex1). This suggests maybe the pattern only overwrites if the pattern pixel is *not* white (0)? Let's check the center: Pattern pixel (4,4) is Green (3). Input pixel (5,5) is Green (3). Output is Green (3). Consistent. Let's check another: Pattern pixel (2,8) is Green (3). Input pixel (3,8) is Red (2). Output is Green (3). Suggests pattern's non-white pixels *do* overwrite. What about pattern's white pixels? Pattern pixel (1,4) = White(0). Input pixel (2, 4) = White(0). Output = White(0). Consistent. Pattern pixel (7,1) = White(0). Input pixel (8,2) = Red(2). Output = Red(2). This supports the idea: **The pattern is drawn, but only non-white pixels from the pattern overwrite the existing grid content. White pixels in the pattern leave the underlying grid pixel unchanged.**\n\n3.  **Conditional Last Row**: The metrics confirm the condition (input non-white count == 1) correctly identifies Example 1 for the last-row fill and excludes Examples 2 and 3. This part of the logic seems sound.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
