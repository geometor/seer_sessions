Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Size:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid in all examples.
2.  **Color Palette:**
    *   Input grids contain only white (0) and azure (8) pixels.
    *   Output grids contain only white (0) and red (2) pixels.
3.  **Transformation Logic:**
    *   Azure (8) pixels in the input consistently become white (0) pixels in the output.
    *   White (0) pixels in the input sometimes remain white (0) and sometimes become red (2) in the output.
    *   The change for an input white (0) pixel seems dependent on its surrounding pixels in the input grid.
4.  **Neighborhood Influence:** Let's examine the 8 neighbors (including diagonals) of each input pixel.
    *   Consider an input white (0) pixel. Count how many of its 8 neighbors are azure (8).
    *   In `train_1`, input `(1, 2)` is white (0). Its neighbors `(0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=0, (1,1)=8, (1,3)=8, (2,1)=8, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=8` contain 4 azure pixels. The output `(1, 2)` is red (2).
    *   In `train_1`, input `(1, 7)` is white (0). Its neighbors `(0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=0, (1,6)=8, (1,8)=0, (2,6)=8, (2,7)=8, (2,8)=0` contain 3 azure pixels. The output `(1, 7)` is red (2).
    *   In `train_1`, input `(3, 9)` is white (0). Its neighbors `(2,8)=0, (2,9)=0, (2,10)=8, (3,8)=0, (3,10)=8, (4,8)=0, (4,9)=0, (4,10)=0` contain 2 azure pixels. The output `(3, 9)` is red (2).
    *   In `train_1`, input `(2, 2)` is white (0). Its neighbors `(1,1)=8, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=8, (2,1)=8, (2,3)=8, (3,1)=8, (3,2)=8, (3,3)=8` contain 7 azure pixels? Let me recheck the input grid. Ah, input `(2,2)` is 0, not 8. Input neighbors are `(1,1)=8, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=8, (2,1)=8, (2,3)=0, (3,1)=8, (3,2)=8, (3,3)=8`. That's 6 azure neighbors. Output `(2,2)` is red (2). Hmm, let me recheck my count for `(1,2)`. Input `(1,2)` neighbors: `(0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=0, (1,1)=8, (1,3)=8, (2,1)=8, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=8`. Yes, 4 azure neighbors. Output is red (2). Let me recount for `(2,2)`. Input `(2,2)=0`. Neighbors: `(1,1)=8, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=8, (2,1)=8, (2,3)=0, (3,1)=8, (3,2)=8, (3,3)=8`. Count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 6 azure neighbors. Output is red(2).
    *   Let's recheck `(1,7)`. Input `(1,7)=0`. Neighbors: `(0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=0, (1,6)=8, (1,8)=0, (2,6)=8, (2,7)=8, (2,8)=0`. Count: 3 azure neighbors. Output is red(2).
    *   Let's check a white pixel that stays white. Input `(1, 0)` is white (0). Neighbors `(0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (1,1)=8, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=8`. Count: 2 azure neighbors. Output `(1,0)` is white(0).
    *   Let's check input `(1,4)`. Input `(1,4)=0`. Neighbors: `(0,3)=0, (0,4)=0, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=8, (1,5)=8, (2,3)=8, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0`. Count: 3 azure neighbors. Output `(1,4)` is white(0).

    There seems to be a contradiction. `(1,7)` has 3 neighbors and becomes red. `(1,4)` has 3 neighbors and stays white. Let me rethink.

    Maybe the rule is simpler. What if it's Conway's Game of Life-like rules?
    - An azure cell (8) dies -> becomes white (0).
    - A white cell (0) becomes "alive" (red, 2) if it has *exactly* 3 azure neighbors? Let's test.
        - `train_1`:
            - `(1,7)` input 0, 3 neighbors -> output 2. Correct.
            - `(2,9)` input 0, 3 neighbors -> output 2. Correct.
            - `(1,2)` input 0, 4 neighbors -> output 2. Incorrect by this rule.
            - `(1,6)` input 0, 4 neighbors -> output 2. Incorrect by this rule.
            - `(2,7)` input 0, 4 neighbors -> output 2. Incorrect by this rule.
            - `(2,11)` input 0, 4 neighbors -> output 2. Incorrect by this rule.
            - `(2,2)` input 0, 6 neighbors -> output 2. Incorrect by this rule.
            - `(2,5)` input 0, 5 neighbors -> output 2. Incorrect by this rule.
            - `(3,9)` input 0, 2 neighbors -> output 2. Incorrect by this rule.

    Okay, the simple GoL birth rule (exactly 3 neighbors) is not it.

    Let's reconsider the counts where white became red: {4, 3, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3, 4}.
    Let's reconsider the counts where white stayed white: {2, 3}.

    Wait, my count for `(2,2)` was wrong. Let's use a systematic check.
    Input `train_1`:
    
```
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 8 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0
    0 8 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0
    0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    ```

    Output `train_1`:
    
```
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 0
    0 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    ```

    Let's check the input neighbors for every output red pixel:
    - Output (1,2)=2: Input (1,2)=0. Neighbors=8 at (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). Count=4.
    - Output (1,6)=2: Input (1,6)=0. Neighbors=8 at (1,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6). Count=4.
    - Output (1,7)=2: Input (1,7)=0. Neighbors=8 at (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,7). Count=4? No, input(2,7)=0. Neighbors=8 at (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,7). Correct. Count = 4.
    - Output (2,2)=2: Input (2,2)=0. Neighbors=8 at (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Count=7? No, input(2,3)=0. Neighbors=8 at (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Count=6.
    - Output (2,5)=2: Input (2,5)=0. Neighbors=8 at (1,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). Count=5.
    - Output (2,7)=2: Input (2,7)=0. Neighbors=8 at (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,7). Count=4.
    - Output (2,9)=2: Input (2,9)=0. Neighbors=8 at (1,10), (1,11), (3,10), (3,11). Count=4? No, input(1,9)=0, input(2,10)=8, input(3,9)=0. Neighbors = 8 at (1,10), (1,11), (2,10), (3,10), (3,11). Count=5.
    - Output (2,11)=2: Input (2,11)=0. Neighbors=8 at (1,10), (1,11), (2,10), (3,10), (3,11). Count=5.
    - Output (3,9)=2: Input (3,9)=0. Neighbors=8 at (2,10), (3,10), (3,11). Count=3.

    Counts for White -> Red: {4, 4, 4, 6, 5, 4, 5, 5, 3}
    Let's recheck the white -> white cases:
    - Input (1,0)=0. Neighbors=8 at (1,1), (2,1). Count=2. Output=0.
    - Input (1,4)=0. Neighbors=8 at (1,3), (1,5), (2,3). Count=3? No, input(2,3)=0. Neighbors=8 at (1,3), (1,5), (2,1), (3,1)? No, that's too far. Input(1,4)=0. Neighbors=8 at (1,3), (1,5), (2,3)=0, (3,1)=8, (3,2)=8, (3,3)=8. Neighbors=8 at (1,3), (1,5), (2,3)=0, (3,3)=8. This is getting confusing. Let's use coordinates.
    - Input (1,4)=0. Neighbors: (0,3)=0, (0,4)=0, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=8, (1,5)=8, (2,3)=8, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0. Count = 3. Output = 0.
    - Input (3,4)=0. Neighbors: (2,3)=8, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=8, (3,5)=8, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0. Count = 3. Output = 0.

    Summary:
    - White -> Red: Neighbor counts {3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6}
    - White -> White: Neighbor counts {2, 3, 3} (and many others with 0 or 1)

    So, a white pixel (0) becomes red (2) if it has 3, 4, 5, or 6 *azure* neighbors in the input.
    A white pixel (0) stays white (0) if it has 0, 1, 2, 7, or 8 azure neighbors.
    An azure pixel (8) becomes white (0).

    Let's verify this hypothesis with `train_2`.
    - Input (1,2)=0. Neighbors: (0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=0, (1,1)=8, (1,3)=8, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=8, (2,3)=0. Count=3. Rule says output=2. Actual output=2. Correct.
    - Input (1,6)=0. Neighbors: (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=8, (1,7)=8, (2,5)=8, (2,6)=8, (2,7)=8. Count=5. Rule says output=2. Actual output=2. Correct.
    - Input (6,5)=0. Neighbors: (5,4)=0, (5,5)=8, (5,6)=8, (6,4)=0, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=8, (7,6)=8. Count=4. Rule says output=2. Actual output=2. Correct.
    - Input (7,1)=0. Neighbors: (6,0)=0, (6,1)=8, (6,2)=0, (7,0)=0, (7,2)=8, (8,0)=0, (8,1)=0, (8,2)=0. Count=2. Rule says output=0. Actual output=2. Incorrect.

    My counting or hypothesis is wrong. Let's re-examine `train_2` Output (7,1)=2. Input (7,1)=0. Neighbors: (6,0)=0, (6,1)=8, (6,2)=0, (7,0)=0, (7,2)=8, (8,0)=0, (8,1)=0, (8,2)=8. Count=3. Rule (3,4,5,6 neighbors) says Output=2. Actual output=2. Okay, my previous check was wrong.

    Let's try `train_2` Input(4,1)=0. Neighbors: (3,0)=0, (3,1)=8, (3,2)=0, (4,0)=0, (4,2)=0, (5,0)=0, (5,1)=8, (5,2)=8. Count=3. Rule says Output=2. Actual Output=0. Incorrect.

    Hypothesis is wrong.

    Let's reconsider the transformation. Azure (8) always goes to White (0). White (0) sometimes goes to Red (2).
    Maybe the rule isn't just the count, but the *configuration*? Or perhaps only *orthogonal* neighbors count?

    **Hypothesis 2: Orthogonal Neighbors**
    Count only the neighbors directly Up, Down, Left, Right.
    - Rule A: Input 8 -> Output 0.
    - Rule B: Input 0 -> Output 2 if `N` orthogonal azure neighbors?
    - Rule C: Input 0 -> Output 0 otherwise.

    Test `train_1`:
    - Output(1,2)=2. Input(1,2)=0. Ortho Neighbors: (0,2)=0, (2,2)=0, (1,1)=8, (1,3)=8. Count=2.
    - Output(1,6)=2. Input(1,6)=0. Ortho Neighbors: (0,6)=0, (2,6)=8, (1,5)=8, (1,7)=0. Count=2.
    - Output(1,7)=2. Input(1,7)=0. Ortho Neighbors: (0,7)=0, (2,7)=8, (1,6)=8, (1,8)=0. Count=2.
    - Output(2,2)=2. Input(2,2)=0. Ortho Neighbors: (1,2)=0, (3,2)=8, (2,1)=8, (2,3)=8. Count=3.
    - Output(2,5)=2. Input(2,5)=0. Ortho Neighbors: (1,5)=8, (3,5)=8, (2,4)=0, (2,6)=8. Count=3.
    - Output(2,7)=2. Input(2,7)=0. Ortho Neighbors: (1,7)=0, (3,7)=8, (2,6)=8, (2,8)=0. Count=2.
    - Output(2,9)=2. Input(2,9)=0. Ortho Neighbors: (1,9)=0, (3,9)=0, (2,8)=0, (2,10)=8. Count=1.
    - Output(2,11)=2. Input(2,11)=0. Ortho Neighbors: (1,11)=8, (3,11)=8, (2,10)=8, (2,12)=0. Count=3.
    - Output(3,9)=2. Input(3,9)=0. Ortho Neighbors: (2,9)=0, (4,9)=0, (3,8)=0, (3,10)=8. Count=1.

    Counts for White -> Red: {2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1}. Doesn't seem consistent.

    **Hypothesis 3: Focus on the Azure shapes**
    The azure pixels form scattered dots and L-shapes or blocks. The red pixels in the output seem to appear *inside* concavities or near these azure shapes.

    Let's look at the positions *relative* to the azure pixels.
    Consider `train_1`:
    Input:
    
```
    . . . . . . . . . . . . .
    . 8 . 8 . 8 . . . 8 8 . .
    . 8 . 8 . . 8 . . . 8 . .
    . 8 8 8 . 8 8 8 . . 8 8 .
    . . . . . . . . . . . . .
    ```

    Output:
