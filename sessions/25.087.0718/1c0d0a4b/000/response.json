            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Size:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid in all examples.\n2.  **Color Palette:**\n    *   Input grids contain only white (0) and azure (8) pixels.\n    *   Output grids contain only white (0) and red (2) pixels.\n3.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   Azure (8) pixels in the input consistently become white (0) pixels in the output.\n    *   White (0) pixels in the input sometimes remain white (0) and sometimes become red (2) in the output.\n    *   The change for an input white (0) pixel seems dependent on its surrounding pixels in the input grid.\n4.  **Neighborhood Influence:** Let's examine the 8 neighbors (including diagonals) of each input pixel.\n    *   Consider an input white (0) pixel. Count how many of its 8 neighbors are azure (8).\n    *   In `train_1`, input `(1, 2)` is white (0). Its neighbors `(0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=0, (1,1)=8, (1,3)=8, (2,1)=8, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=8` contain 4 azure pixels. The output `(1, 2)` is red (2).\n    *   In `train_1`, input `(1, 7)` is white (0). Its neighbors `(0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=0, (1,6)=8, (1,8)=0, (2,6)=8, (2,7)=8, (2,8)=0` contain 3 azure pixels. The output `(1, 7)` is red (2).\n    *   In `train_1`, input `(3, 9)` is white (0). Its neighbors `(2,8)=0, (2,9)=0, (2,10)=8, (3,8)=0, (3,10)=8, (4,8)=0, (4,9)=0, (4,10)=0` contain 2 azure pixels. The output `(3, 9)` is red (2).\n    *   In `train_1`, input `(2, 2)` is white (0). Its neighbors `(1,1)=8, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=8, (2,1)=8, (2,3)=8, (3,1)=8, (3,2)=8, (3,3)=8` contain 7 azure pixels? Let me recheck the input grid. Ah, input `(2,2)` is 0, not 8. Input neighbors are `(1,1)=8, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=8, (2,1)=8, (2,3)=0, (3,1)=8, (3,2)=8, (3,3)=8`. That's 6 azure neighbors. Output `(2,2)` is red (2). Hmm, let me recheck my count for `(1,2)`. Input `(1,2)` neighbors: `(0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=0, (1,1)=8, (1,3)=8, (2,1)=8, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=8`. Yes, 4 azure neighbors. Output is red (2). Let me recount for `(2,2)`. Input `(2,2)=0`. Neighbors: `(1,1)=8, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=8, (2,1)=8, (2,3)=0, (3,1)=8, (3,2)=8, (3,3)=8`. Count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 6 azure neighbors. Output is red(2).\n    *   Let's recheck `(1,7)`. Input `(1,7)=0`. Neighbors: `(0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=0, (1,6)=8, (1,8)=0, (2,6)=8, (2,7)=8, (2,8)=0`. Count: 3 azure neighbors. Output is red(2).\n    *   Let's check a white pixel that stays white. Input `(1, 0)` is white (0). Neighbors `(0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (1,1)=8, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=8`. Count: 2 azure neighbors. Output `(1,0)` is white(0).\n    *   Let's check input `(1,4)`. Input `(1,4)=0`. Neighbors: `(0,3)=0, (0,4)=0, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=8, (1,5)=8, (2,3)=8, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0`. Count: 3 azure neighbors. Output `(1,4)` is white(0).\n\n    There seems to be a contradiction. `(1,7)` has 3 neighbors and becomes red. `(1,4)` has 3 neighbors and stays white. Let me rethink.\n\n    Maybe the rule is simpler. What if it's Conway's Game of Life-like rules?\n    - An azure cell (8) dies -> becomes white (0).\n    - A white cell (0) becomes \"alive\" (red, 2) if it has *exactly* 3 azure neighbors? Let's test.\n        - `train_1`:\n            - `(1,7)` input 0, 3 neighbors -> output 2. Correct.\n            - `(2,9)` input 0, 3 neighbors -> output 2. Correct.\n            - `(1,2)` input 0, 4 neighbors -> output 2. Incorrect by this rule.\n            - `(1,6)` input 0, 4 neighbors -> output 2. Incorrect by this rule.\n            - `(2,7)` input 0, 4 neighbors -> output 2. Incorrect by this rule.\n            - `(2,11)` input 0, 4 neighbors -> output 2. Incorrect by this rule.\n            - `(2,2)` input 0, 6 neighbors -> output 2. Incorrect by this rule.\n            - `(2,5)` input 0, 5 neighbors -> output 2. Incorrect by this rule.\n            - `(3,9)` input 0, 2 neighbors -> output 2. Incorrect by this rule.\n\n    Okay, the simple GoL birth rule (exactly 3 neighbors) is not it.\n\n    Let's reconsider the counts where white became red: {4, 3, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3, 4}.\n    Let's reconsider the counts where white stayed white: {2, 3}.\n\n    Wait, my count for `(2,2)` was wrong. Let's use a systematic check.\n    Input `train_1`:\n    "

Neighbors: (0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=0, (1,1)=8, (1,3)=8, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=8, (2,3)=0. Count=3. Rule says output=2. Actual output=2. Correct.\n    - Input (1,6)=0.

Let's re-examine `train_2` Output (7,1)=2. Input (7,1)=0. Neighbors: (6,0)=0, (6,1)=8, (6,2)=0, (7,0)=0, (7,2)=8, (8,0)=0, (8,1)=0, (8,2)=8. Count=3. Rule (3,4,5,6 neighbors) says Output=2. Actual output=2. Okay, my previous check was wrong.\n\n    Let's try `train_2` Input(4,1)=0. Neighbors: (3,0)=0, (3,1)=8, (3,2)=0, (4,0)=0, (4,2)=0, (5,0)=0, (5,1)=8, (5,2)=8. Count=3. Rule says Output=2. Actual Output=0. Incorrect.\n\n    Hypothesis is wrong.\n\n    Let's reconsider the transformation. Azure (8) always goes to White (0). White (0) sometimes goes to Red (2).\n    Maybe the rule isn't just the count, but the *configuration*? Or perhaps only *orthogonal* neighbors count?\n\n    **Hypothesis 2: Orthogonal Neighbors**\n    Count only the neighbors directly Up, Down, Left, Right.\n    - Rule A: Input 8 -> Output 0.\n    - Rule B: Input 0 -> Output 2 if `N` orthogonal azure neighbors?\n    - Rule C: Input 0 -> Output 0 otherwise.\n\n    Test `train_1`:\n    - Output(1,2)=2.

Input(2,5)=0. Ortho Neighbors: (1,5)=8, (3,5)=8, (2,4)=0, (2,6)=8. Count=3.\n    - Output(2,7)=2. Input(2,7)=0. Ortho Neighbors: (1,7)=0, (3,7)=8, (2,6)=8, (2,8)=0. Count=2.\n    - Output(2,9)=2.

Count=3.\n    - Output(3,9)=2. Input(3,9)=0. Ortho Neighbors: (2,9)=0, (4,9)=0, (3,8)=0, (3,10)=8. Count=1.\n\n    Counts for White -> Red: {2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1}. Doesn't seem consistent.\n\n    **Hypothesis 3: Focus on the Azure shapes**\n    The azure pixels form scattered dots and L-shapes or blocks. The red pixels in the output seem to appear *inside* concavities or near these azure shapes.\n\n    Let's look at the positions *relative* to the azure pixels.\n    Consider `train_1`:\n    Input:\n    "
