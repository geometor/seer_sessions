Transformation Rule:
1. Identify all distinct connected components (objects) of non-white pixels in the input grid using 4-way adjacency.
2. Determine the component with the largest number of pixels; this is the 'frame'. Store its color ('frame_color') and coordinates ('frame_coords').
3. If no non-white components exist, return the input grid unchanged.
4. Create a set of 'barrier_coords' containing the coordinates of *all* non-white pixels found in step 1 (including the frame and any internal objects).
5. Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all white (0) pixels located on the grid borders.
6. The BFS can only traverse white pixels and cannot enter any coordinates present in the 'barrier_coords' set.
7. Keep track of all white pixels visited by the BFS ('reachable_white_coords'). These are the white pixels connected to the outside.
8. Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
9. Iterate through every pixel (r, c) of the grid:
    a. If the pixel in the *input* grid `input_grid[r, c]` is white (0) AND its coordinate `(r, c)` is *not* in the 'reachable_white_coords' set:
        i. Set the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid `output_grid[r, c]` to the 'frame_color'.
10. Return the modified output grid.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.

**General Assessment & Strategy**

The previous code correctly identified the concept of a "frame" object and filling internal "white space" with the frame's color. However, it failed because it filled *all* internal white space. The expected outputs clearly show that some internal white pixels, specifically those adjacent to *other* internal non-white objects (the gray pixels in the examples), should *remain* white.

The strategy is to modify the transformation rule and the corresponding code to:
1.  Distinguish between the "frame" object and other "internal" non-white objects.
2.  Identify white pixels that are adjacent (likely orthogonally) to these internal objects.
3.  Prevent these adjacent white pixels from being filled, even if they are inside the frame and not reachable from the outside border.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Let's re-examine Example 1 to confirm the adjacency hypothesis.

*   **Input Grid (Example 1):**
    
```
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0  <- Frame (Red, 2)
    0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0
    0 2 0 5 0 0 5 0 2 0 0  <- Internal Objects (Gray, 5) at (3,3), (3,6), (4,5)
    0 2 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0
    0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0
    0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    ```

*   **Expected Output:** Shows white pixels at (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,6) remaining white.
*   **Transformed Output:** Shows these same pixels filled with red (2).
*   **Error Pixels:** (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,6).

Let's check the orthogonal neighbors of these error pixels in the *input* grid:
*   (3,4): Neighbors are (2,4)=0, (4,4)=0, (3,3)=5, (3,5)=0. Adjacent to gray at (3,3).
*   (3,5): Neighbors are (2,5)=0, (4,5)=5, (3,4)=0, (3,6)=5. Adjacent to gray at (4,5) and (3,6).
*   (4,3): Neighbors are (3,3)=5, (5,3)=0, (4,2)=0, (4,4)=0. Adjacent to gray at (3,3).
*   (4,4): Neighbors are (3,4)=0, (5,4)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,5)=5. Adjacent to gray at (4,5).
*   (4,6): Neighbors are (3,6)=5, (5,6)=0, (4,5)=5, (4,7)=0. Adjacent to gray at (3,6) and (4,5).

**Conclusion:** In Example 1, all incorrectly filled white pixels (the error pixels) are orthogonally adjacent to at least one internal gray (5) pixel. The same pattern holds for Examples 2 and 3.

This confirms the hypothesis: White pixels orthogonally adjacent to internal non-frame objects should be preserved (not filled).

**YAML Fact Document**


```yaml
task_description: Fill enclosed areas within the largest object (frame), preserving internal objects and their adjacent white pixels.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Variable height and width.
  - colors: Multiple colors present, including white (0) for background, one color for the main frame object, and potentially other colors for internal objects.

objects:
  - type: Frame
    description: The largest connected component of non-white pixels using 4-way adjacency. It encloses an area.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the frame pixels (e.g., red=2 in examples).
      - shape: Typically rectangular or boundary-like.
    actions:
      - Used to determine the fill color for enclosed white areas.
      - Acts as a barrier for reachability checks.
  - type: Internal Object
    description: Any non-white connected component that is *not* the frame. Located within the area enclosed by the frame.
    properties:
      - color: Can be any non-white color (e.g., gray=5 in examples).
      - shape: Variable.
    actions:
      - Acts as a barrier for reachability checks.
      - Prevents orthogonally adjacent white pixels from being filled.
  - type: Background Pixel
    description: Pixels with color white (0).
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
    subtypes:
      - External White: White pixels connected to the grid border via other white pixels, not crossing any non-white barriers. Remain unchanged.
      - Internal Protected White: White pixels *not* connected to the border, but orthogonally adjacent to an Internal Object. Remain unchanged.
      - Internal Fillable White: White pixels *not* connected to the border and *not* adjacent to an Internal Object. These are filled with the Frame's color.

transformations:
  - step: 1. Identify all distinct non-white connected components (objects).
  - step: 2. Determine the largest component (the 'frame') and its color ('frame_color'). Identify all other components as 'internal_objects'.
  - step: 3. Create a set of all non-white pixel coordinates ('barrier_coords').
  - step: 4. Identify white pixels reachable from the border ('reachable_white_coords') using BFS, avoiding 'barrier_coords'.
  - step: 5. Identify white pixels orthogonally adjacent to any 'internal_object' pixel ('protected_white_coords').
  - step: 6. Create the output grid, initially a copy of the input.
  - step: 7. Iterate through all white pixels (r, c) in the input grid.
  - step: 8. If a white pixel (r, c) is *not* in 'reachable_white_coords' AND *not* in 'protected_white_coords', change its color in the output grid to 'frame_color'.
  - step: 9. Return the modified output grid.

edge_cases:
  - If no non-white objects exist, return the input grid unchanged.
  - If only one non-white object exists (it's the frame), there are no internal objects, so no white pixels are protected by adjacency. Fill occurs as in the previous logic.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all separate connected groups (objects) of non-white pixels in the input grid, using 4-way (up, down, left, right) connections. If there are no non-white objects, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  Find the object with the most pixels. This is the 'frame'. Note its color (the 'frame\_color').
3.  Identify all other non-white objects besides the frame; these are the 'internal objects'.
4.  Create a set of 'barrier coordinates' containing the locations of *all* non-white pixels (from the frame and all internal objects).
5.  Find all white pixels that can be reached starting from any white pixel on the border of the grid, moving only through other white pixels (4-way adjacency) and without entering any 'barrier coordinates'. Mark these as 'reachable white pixels'.
6.  Find all white pixels that are orthogonally adjacent (share an edge, not just a corner) to any pixel belonging to an 'internal object'. Mark these as 'protected white pixels'.
7.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
8.  Examine every pixel location (row, column) in the grid. If the pixel in the *input* grid is white AND it is *not* a 'reachable white pixel' AND it is *not* a 'protected white pixel', then change the color of that pixel in the *output* grid to the 'frame\_color'.
9.  Return the final output grid.
