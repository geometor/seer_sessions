Within this background, there's a larger, contiguous object forming a frame, always red (2) in the examples. Inside this frame, there's a mix of white pixels (0) and potentially some smaller objects, which are gray (5) in the examples.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the original frame structure (red pixels) and the internal gray objects in their original positions. The key change occurs in the white pixels *inside* the frame.\n3.  **Transformation:** The white pixels (0) located strictly *within* the boundary defined by the red frame are changed to red (2). The white pixels *outside* the frame remain white. The red frame pixels themselves and the internal gray pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Key Elements:**\n    *   **Frame:** The largest non-white connected component acts as a boundary.\n    *   **Interior:** The region enclosed by the frame.\n    *   **Internal Objects:** Non-white, non-frame objects within the interior (gray pixels).\n    *   **Fill Operation:** The transformation acts like a flood fill of the interior white space using the frame's color, but respecting the internal objects.\n5.  **Inferred Rule:** The task is to identify the main boundary shape (the red frame), identify the white space enclosed by it, and fill that enclosed white space with the boundary's color (red), while preserving any other non-white objects found within that enclosed space.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the largest connected component (object) composed of a single non-white color in the input grid. This is the 'frame'. Note its color (`frame_color`) and the coordinates of its pixels.\n3.  Create a temporary boolean grid of the same dimensions, initialized to `False`. Mark the locations corresponding to the `frame` pixels as `True` (visited/barrier).\n4.  Perform a flood fill (or similar connectivity search like Breadth-First Search) starting from all white (0) pixels located on the border (edges) of the input grid.\n5.  During this flood fill, only traverse onto adjacent white (0) pixels that have not already been visited (marked `True` in the temporary grid). Mark every newly visited white pixel as `True` in the temporary grid. These marked white pixels represent the 'external' white area connected to the outside.\n6.  Iterate through every pixel `(row, column)` of the input grid.\n7.  If the pixel at `(row, column)` in the input grid is white (0) AND its corresponding location in the temporary boolean grid is `False` (meaning it's white but was not reached by the border flood fill, thus it's 'internal'), change the color of the pixel at `(row, column)` in the **output grid** to `frame_color`.\n8.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged from their initial copied state (they retain their original colors from the input: frame pixels, internal non-white objects, and external white pixels).\n9.  Return the final output grid."
