objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: primarily surrounding other elements, potentially inside the frame
  - type: frame
    color: red (2) # Note: Consistent across examples, but might vary in test case. Identified as the largest non-white contiguous object.
    shape: rectangular boundary
    properties: encloses an area
  - type: internal_object
    color: gray (5) # Note: Consistent across examples, but might vary.
    location: inside the area enclosed by the frame
    properties: preserved in the output

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: containment
    subject: frame
    object: internal_object, some white pixels
  - type: spatial
    relation: adjacency
    description: Used to define contiguous objects (frame) and connectivity for fill.

actions:
  - name: identify_frame
    input: input grid
    output: coordinates and color of the frame object (largest non-white connected component)
  - name: identify_internal_area
    input: input grid, frame coordinates
    output: coordinates of white pixels enclosed by the frame
  - name: identify_internal_objects
    input: input grid, frame coordinates
    output: coordinates and colors of non-white, non-frame pixels enclosed by the frame
  - name: fill_internal_area
    input: internal_area coordinates, frame color
    output: modified grid where internal white pixels are changed to frame color
  - name: preserve_elements
    input: frame coordinates/color, internal_objects coordinates/colors, external white pixels
    output: ensure these elements remain unchanged in the final output grid

transformation_summary:
  - The white (0) pixels enclosed by the largest contiguous non-white object (the frame, color red=2) are changed to the frame's color (red=2).
  - The frame itself, any other non-white objects inside the frame (gray=5), and any white pixels outside the frame remain unchanged.
