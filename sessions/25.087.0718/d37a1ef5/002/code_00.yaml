task_description: Fill enclosed white areas, respecting internal objects as barriers.
inputs:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
outputs:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
core_logic:
  - Identify the largest connected component of a single non-white color (the 'frame').
  - Identify all other non-white objects ('internal_objects') present in the input grid.
  - Define a 'barrier' set containing the coordinates of both the 'frame' and all 'internal_objects'.
  - Perform a reachability analysis (e.g., BFS) starting from all white border pixels.
  - The BFS can only traverse white pixels and cannot enter pixels belonging to the 'barrier' set.
  - Mark all white pixels reachable from the border ('external_white').
  - Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - Iterate through all grid cells (r, c):
    - If the input grid cell `input[r, c]` is white (0) AND `(r, c)` was *not* marked as 'external_white':
      - Set the output grid cell `output[r, c]` to the color of the 'frame'.
    - Otherwise, `output[r, c]` retains the value from `input[r, c]`.
objects:
  - type: frame
    description: The largest connected component of a single non-white color.
    properties: [color, coordinates, connectivity=4]
    action: Defines the primary boundary and the fill color. Acts as a barrier.
  - type: internal_object
    description: Any non-white, non-frame object within the grid.
    properties: [color, coordinates, connectivity=4]
    action: Acts as a barrier for the fill process. Retains its original color and position.
  - type: background
    description: White pixels (color 0).
    properties: [color=0, coordinates]
    subtypes:
      - external_white: Reachable from grid borders without crossing barriers. Retains color 0.
      - internal_white: Not reachable from grid borders due to barriers.
    action: 'internal_white' pixels are filled with the 'frame' color.
