Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation logic.

**General Assessment**

The provided code successfully identifies the largest connected non-white object (the 'frame') and determines the area enclosed by it. The core logic performs a 'flood fill' operation starting from the borders to find externally reachable white pixels, correctly identifying the 'internal' area.

However, the current implementation incorrectly changes the color of *all* pixels within the identified internal area to the frame's color. The examples clearly show that only the *white* (0) pixels within this internal area should be changed to the frame's color. Any non-white pixels (like the gray '5' objects in the examples) located within the enclosed area must retain their original color.

The strategy is to modify the final step of the transformation: instead of iterating through `internal_white_coords` and unconditionally setting the `output_grid` pixel to `frame_color`, we need to check if the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *original* `input_grid` is white (0) before changing its color in the `output_grid`.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Let's examine the differences more closely for each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Grid Size: 8x11
    *   Output Grid Size: 8x11
    *   Frame Color: Red (2)
    *   Internal Objects: Gray (5) at (3,3), (3,6), (4,5)
    *   Discrepancy: The code changed the gray pixels at (3,3), (3,6), (4,5) to red (2). The expected output preserves these gray pixels. The code also incorrectly filled white pixels at (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,6), (4,7), (5,3) to (5,7) with red (2), which *is* the correct behavior for those specific white pixels. The 5 pixels reported as 'off' correspond exactly to the locations of the gray objects and the white pixels inside them that should have been filled but weren't handled correctly relative to the gray objects. Let's re-evaluate the calculation.
    *   Input `(r, c)`: value -> Expected: value, Transformed: value
    *   (3,3): 5 -> Expected: 5, Transformed: 2 (Incorrect)
    *   (3,4): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)
    *   (3,5): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)
    *   (3,6): 5 -> Expected: 5, Transformed: 2 (Incorrect)
    *   (4,3): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)
    *   (4,4): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)
    *   (4,5): 5 -> Expected: 5, Transformed: 2 (Incorrect)
    *   (4,6): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)
    *   (4,7): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)
    *   (5,3): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)
    *   (5,4): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)
    *   (5,5): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)
    *   (5,6): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)
    *   (5,7): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)
    *   Revisiting the "Pixels Off": The report says 5 pixels off. Let's compare Expected vs Transformed:
        *   (3,3): Expected 5, Got 2 (Off)
        *   (3,6): Expected 5, Got 2 (Off)
        *   (4,5): Expected 5, Got 2 (Off)
        *   (3,4): Expected 2, Got 2
        *   (3,5): Expected 2, Got 2
        *   (4,3): Expected 2, Got 2
        *   (4,4): Expected 2, Got 2
        *   (4,6): Expected 2, Got 2
        *   (4,7): Expected 2, Got 2
        *   (5,3): Expected 2, Got 2
        *   (5,4): Expected 2, Got 2
        *   (5,5): Expected 2, Got 2
        *   (5,6): Expected 2, Got 2
        *   (5,7): Expected 2, Got 2
    *   It seems my manual comparison differs from the report's "Pixels Off" count. The report might be comparing the *Transformed* output to the *Expected* output directly. Let's re-examine the provided outputs:
        *   Expected (relevant section):
            
```
            ...
            0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0
            0 2 2 5 0 0 5 2 2 0 0
            0 2 2 0 0 5 0 2 2 0 0
            0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0
            ...
            ```

        *   Transformed (relevant section):
            
```
            ...
            0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0
            0 2 2 5 2 2 5 2 2 0 0  <- (3,4)=2, (3,5)=2 -> Expected 0,0? No, expected 2,2. My mistake. Let's re-re-check.
            0 2 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 0 0  <- (4,3)=2, (4,4)=2, (4,6)=2, (4,7)=2 -> Expected 0,0,0,0? No, expected 2,2,2,2.
            0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0
            ...
            ```

        *   Okay, let's compare Expected vs Transformed cell-by-cell in the internal area:
            *   (3,3): Exp 5, Trans 5 (Match)
            *   (3,4): Exp 2, Trans 2 (Match)
            *   (3,5): Exp 2, Trans 2 (Match)
            *   (3,6): Exp 5, Trans 5 (Match)
            *   (4,3): Exp 2, Trans 2 (Match)
            *   (4,4): Exp 0, Trans 2 (Off) <- Problem 1
            *   (4,5): Exp 5, Trans 5 (Match)
            *   (4,6): Exp 0, Trans 2 (Off) <- Problem 2
            *   (4,7): Exp 2, Trans 2 (Match)
            *   (5,3): Exp 2, Trans 2 (Match)
            *   (5,4): Exp 2, Trans 2 (Match)
            *   (5,5): Exp 2, Trans 2 (Match)
            *   (5,6): Exp 2, Trans 2 (Match)
            *   (5,7): Exp 2, Trans 2 (Match)
        *   The 'Pixels Off' count seems inconsistent with my manual check based on the *displayed* outputs. However, the core issue remains: the transformation logic should only fill *original* white cells. Let's trust the reported 'Pixels Off' and proceed with the core logic correction. The calculation in `find_internal_white_coords` seems to misidentify some internal white pixels, or the filling logic is subtly wrong.
        *   Let's re-examine `find_internal_white_coords`. It identifies white cells NOT reachable from the border by traversing only white cells, *avoiding* the barrier cells. This seems correct.
        *   Let's re-examine the final filling loop in `transform`: `for r, c in internal_white_coords: output_grid[r, c] = frame_color`. This loop iterates through the coordinates identified as internal white cells and sets them to the frame color. This looks like it *should* only affect white cells.
        *   Perhaps the issue is in `find_largest_component` or the interaction. Let's assume `find_largest_component` is correct for now.
        *   Let's trace Example 1:
            *   Frame: Red (2), coords identified.
            *   `find_internal_white_coords`: BFS from border white cells, avoiding frame cells.
            *   Cells like (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,6), (4,7), (5,3)...(5,7) are white.
            *   Are they reachable from the border via white cells? No, because the red frame blocks them. They should be added to `internal_white_coords`.
            *   Cells like (3,3), (3,6), (4,5) are gray (5). They are not white, so `find_internal_white_coords` will ignore them.
            *   The loop `for r, c in internal_white_coords:` should only iterate over the coordinates of initially white cells identified as internal.
            *   Why did the transformed output show changes at (4,4) and (4,6) compared to expected? The expected output has 0s there, while the transformed has 2s. This means `internal_white_coords` *did* include (4,4) and (4,6), and the code filled them. Why does the *expected* output leave them as 0?
            *   Ah! Looking at Example 1 Expected Output again. The gray objects seem to cast a "shadow" or prevent filling adjacent white cells.
            *   Expected Output (Internal Area):
                
```
                2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
                2 5 0 0 5 2 2  <- (4,4)=0, (4,6)=0
                2 0 0 5 0 2 2  <- (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,6)=0
                2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
                ```

            *   The rule is more complex. It's not just "fill all internal white space". It seems like the internal gray objects act as barriers *within* the main frame barrier. White pixels adjacent (maybe only orthogonally?) to internal gray pixels are *not* filled.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Grid Size: 12x11
    *   Output Grid Size: 12x11
    *   Frame Color: Red (2)
    *   Internal Objects: Gray (5) at (4,3), (5,4)
    *   Discrepancy: Similar issue. Code filled white cells adjacent to gray objects that should have remained white.
        *   Expected Output (Internal Area):
            
```
            ...
            2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
            2 5 0 2 2 2 2  <- (4,4)=0
            2 0 5 2 2 2 2  <- (5,3)=0
            2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
            ...
            ```

        *   Transformed Output (Internal Area):
            
```
            ...
            2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
            2 5 2 2 2 2 2  <- (4,4)=2 (Off)
            2 2 5 2 2 2 2  <- (5,3)=2 (Off)
            2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
            ...
            ```

        *   Reported "Pixels Off": 2. This matches (4,4) and (5,3).

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Grid Size: 12x12
    *   Output Grid Size: 12x12
    *   Frame Color: Red (2)
    *   Internal Objects: Gray (5) at (4,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,7)
    *   Discrepancy: Again, white cells adjacent to internal gray objects are incorrectly filled.
        *   Expected Output (Internal Area):
            
```
            ...
            2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
            2 2 5 0 0 0 2 2 2  <- (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0
            2 2 0 0 5 0 2 2 2  <- (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,7)=0
            2 2 5 0 0 5 2 2 2  <- (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0
            2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
            ...
            ```

        *   Transformed Output (Internal Area):
            
```
            ...
            2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
            2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2  <- (4,5)=2, (4,6)=2, (4,7)=2 (Off x3)
            2 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2  <- (5,4)=2, (5,5)=2, (5,7)=2 (Off x3)
            2 2 5 2 2 5 2 2 2  <- (6,5)=2, (6,6)=2 (Off x2)
            2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
            ...
            ```

        *   Reported "Pixels Off": 8. This matches the 3+3+2=8 differences identified above.

**Refined Understanding:**

The internal non-white objects act as secondary barriers *for the filling process*. The fill should originate from the main frame but should not cross or touch (orthogonally) these internal objects.

**Revised Strategy:**

1.  Identify the largest connected non-white component (the 'frame').
2.  Identify all *other* non-white components ('internal objects') located within the bounding box of the frame.
3.  Create a combined barrier map including the frame pixels *and* the internal object pixels.
4.  Perform the BFS flood fill from the borders, using the combined barrier map to determine reachability. Mark all reachable white pixels.
5.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
6.  Iterate through all pixels of the grid. If a pixel is white (0) in the input AND was *not* marked as reachable in step 4, change its color to the frame's color in the output grid.

This approach treats the internal objects identically to the frame *for the purpose of defining the fillable area*.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Fill enclosed white areas, respecting internal objects as barriers.
inputs:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
outputs:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
core_logic:
  - Identify the largest connected component of a single non-white color (the 'frame').
  - Identify all other non-white objects ('internal_objects') present in the input grid.
  - Define a 'barrier' set containing the coordinates of both the 'frame' and all 'internal_objects'.
  - Perform a reachability analysis (e.g., BFS) starting from all white border pixels.
  - The BFS can only traverse white pixels and cannot enter pixels belonging to the 'barrier' set.
  - Mark all white pixels reachable from the border ('external_white').
  - Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - Iterate through all grid cells (r, c):
    - If the input grid cell `input[r, c]` is white (0) AND `(r, c)` was *not* marked as 'external_white':
      - Set the output grid cell `output[r, c]` to the color of the 'frame'.
    - Otherwise, `output[r, c]` retains the value from `input[r, c]`.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all distinct connected components (objects) of non-white pixels in the input grid. Use 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
3.  Identify the component with the largest number of pixels. This is the 'frame'. Store its color ('frame\_color') and the set of its pixel coordinates ('frame\_coords'). If no non-white components exist, return the initial output grid copy.
4.  Create a set called 'barrier\_coords' initially containing all coordinates from 'frame\_coords'.
5.  Identify all *other* non-white components found in step 2 (those that are not the frame). Add the coordinates of all pixels belonging to these 'internal objects' to the 'barrier\_coords' set.
6.  Create a 'reachable\_white' set to store coordinates of white pixels reachable from the grid borders.
7.  Initialize a queue for a Breadth-First Search (BFS) with the coordinates of all white (0) pixels located on the very edge (row 0, last row, column 0, last column) of the grid, provided they are not already in 'barrier\_coords'. Add these initial coordinates to 'reachable\_white'.
8.  Perform the BFS: While the queue is not empty, dequeue a coordinate `(r, c)`. For each of its 4 orthogonal neighbors `(nr, nc)`:
    *   Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries.
    *   Check if the pixel at `(nr, nc)` in the input grid is white (0).
    *   Check if `(nr, nc)` is *not* in 'barrier\_coords'.
    *   Check if `(nr, nc)` has *not* already been added to 'reachable\_white'.
    *   If all conditions are met, add `(nr, nc)` to the 'reachable\_white' set and enqueue it.
9.  Iterate through every pixel coordinate `(r, c)` of the grid:
    *   If the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *input* grid is white (0) AND `(r, c)` is *not* in the 'reachable\_white' set:
        *   Set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to 'frame\_color'.
10. Return the final output grid.
