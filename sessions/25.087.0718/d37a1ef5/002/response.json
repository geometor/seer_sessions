            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation logic.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code successfully identifies the largest connected non-white object (the 'frame') and determines the area enclosed by it. The core logic performs a 'flood fill' operation starting from the borders to find externally reachable white pixels, correctly identifying the 'internal' area.\n\nHowever, the current implementation incorrectly changes the color of *all* pixels within the identified internal area to the frame's color. The examples clearly show that only the *white* (0) pixels within this internal area should be changed to the frame's color. Any non-white pixels (like the gray '5' objects in the examples) located within the enclosed area must retain their original color.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the final step of the transformation: instead of iterating through `internal_white_coords` and unconditionally setting the `output_grid` pixel to `frame_color`, we need to check if the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *original* `input_grid` is white (0) before changing its color in the `output_grid`.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's examine the differences more closely for each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Grid Size: 8x11\n    *   Output Grid Size: 8x11\n    *   Frame Color: Red (2)\n    *   Internal Objects: Gray (5) at (3,3), (3,6), (4,5)\n    *   Discrepancy: The code changed the gray pixels at (3,3), (3,6), (4,5) to red (2). The expected output preserves these gray pixels. The code also incorrectly filled white pixels at (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,6), (4,7), (5,3) to (5,7) with red (2), which *is* the correct behavior for those specific white pixels. The 5 pixels reported as 'off' correspond exactly to the locations of the gray objects and the white pixels inside them that should have been filled but weren't handled correctly relative to the gray objects. Let's re-evaluate the calculation.\n    *   Input `(r, c)`: value -> Expected: value, Transformed: value\n    *   (3,3): 5 -> Expected: 5, Transformed: 2 (Incorrect)\n    *   (3,4): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)\n    *   (3,5): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)\n    *   (3,6): 5 -> Expected: 5, Transformed: 2 (Incorrect)\n    *   (4,3): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)\n    *   (4,4): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)\n    *   (4,5): 5 -> Expected: 5, Transformed: 2 (Incorrect)\n    *   (4,6): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)\n    *   (4,7): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)\n    *   (5,3): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)\n    *   (5,4): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)\n    *   (5,5): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)\n    *   (5,6): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)\n    *   (5,7): 0 -> Expected: 2, Transformed: 2 (Correct)\n    *   Revisiting the \"Pixels Off\": The report says 5 pixels off. Let's compare Expected vs Transformed:\n        *   (3,3): Expected 5, Got 2 (Off)\n        *   (3,6): Expected 5, Got 2 (Off)\n        *   (4,5): Expected 5, Got 2 (Off)\n        *   (3,4): Expected 2, Got 2\n        *   (3,5): Expected 2, Got 2\n        *   (4,3): Expected 2, Got 2\n        *   (4,4): Expected 2, Got 2\n        *   (4,6): Expected 2, Got 2\n        *   (4,7): Expected 2, Got 2\n        *   (5,3): Expected 2, Got 2\n        *   (5,4): Expected 2, Got 2\n        *   (5,5): Expected 2, Got 2\n        *   (5,6): Expected 2, Got 2\n        *   (5,7): Expected 2, Got 2\n    *   It seems my manual comparison differs from the report's \"Pixels Off\" count.

However, the core issue remains: the transformation logic should only fill *original* white cells. Let's trust the reported 'Pixels Off' and proceed with the core logic correction. The calculation in `find_internal_white_coords` seems to misidentify some internal white pixels, or the filling logic is subtly wrong.\n        *   Let's re-examine `find_internal_white_coords`. It identifies white cells NOT reachable from the border by traversing only white cells, *avoiding* the barrier cells. This seems correct.\n        *   Let's re-examine the final filling loop in `transform`: `for r, c in internal_white_coords: output_grid[r, c] = frame_color`. This loop iterates through the coordinates identified as internal white cells and sets them to the frame color. This looks like it *should* only affect white cells.\n        *   Perhaps the issue is in `find_largest_component` or the interaction. Let's assume `find_largest_component` is correct for now.\n        *   Let's trace Example 1:\n            *   Frame: Red (2), coords identified.\n            *   `find_internal_white_coords`: BFS from border white cells, avoiding frame cells.\n            *   Cells like (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,6), (4,7), (5,3)...(5,7) are white.\n            *   Are they reachable from the border via white cells? No, because the red frame blocks them. They should be added to `internal_white_coords`.\n            *   Cells like (3,3), (3,6), (4,5) are gray (5). They are not white, so `find_internal_white_coords` will ignore them.\n            *   The loop `for r, c in internal_white_coords:` should only iterate over the coordinates of initially white cells identified as internal.\n            *   Why did the transformed output show changes at (4,4) and (4,6) compared to expected? The expected output has 0s there, while the transformed has 2s. This means `internal_white_coords` *did* include (4,4) and (4,6), and the code filled them. Why does the *expected* output leave them as 0?\n            *   Ah! Looking at Example 1 Expected Output again. The gray objects seem to cast a \"shadow\" or prevent filling adjacent white cells.\n            *   Expected Output (Internal Area):\n                "
