However, it failed because it filled *all* internal white space. The expected outputs clearly show that some internal white pixels, specifically those adjacent to *other* internal non-white objects (the gray pixels in the examples), should *remain* white.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the transformation rule and the corresponding code to:\n1.  Distinguish between the \"frame\" object and other \"internal\" non-white objects.\n2.  Identify white pixels that are adjacent (likely orthogonally) to these internal objects.\n3.  Prevent these adjacent white pixels from being filled, even if they are inside the frame and not reachable from the outside border.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's re-examine Example 1 to confirm the adjacency hypothesis.\n\n*   **Input Grid (Example 1):**\n    "

Adjacent to gray at (3,3).\n*   (3,5): Neighbors are (2,5)=0, (4,5)=5, (3,4)=0, (3,6)=5. Adjacent to gray at (4,5) and (3,6).\n*   (4,3): Neighbors are (3,3)=5, (5,3)=0, (4,2)=0, (4,4)=0.

The same pattern holds for Examples 2 and 3.\n\nThis confirms the hypothesis: White pixels orthogonally adjacent to internal non-frame objects should be preserved (not filled).\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"
