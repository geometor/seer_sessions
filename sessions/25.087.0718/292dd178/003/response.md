"""
The transformation identifies regions of the background color that are completely enclosed by other colors and fills these enclosed regions with red (2).

1.  Identify the primary background color of the input grid. Assume this is the color of the pixel at the top-left corner (0, 0).
2.  Initialize an output_grid as a copy of the input_grid.
3.  Create a visited grid or set to keep track of background pixels connected to the border.
4.  Scan the border pixels (top/bottom rows, left/right columns) of the input_grid.
5.  For each border pixel that matches the identified background color, initiate a flood fill (like Breadth-First Search):
    *   Mark the starting border pixel as visited.
    *   Explore its adjacent (up, down, left, right) neighbors.
    *   If a neighbor is within the grid boundaries, matches the background color, and has not been visited, mark it as visited and add it to the exploration queue/stack.
    *   Continue until no more connected background pixels can be reached from the border.
6.  Iterate through every pixel (r, c) of the input_grid.
7.  If the pixel (r, c) has the background color but has not been marked as visited (meaning it's not connected to the border), change the color of the corresponding pixel (r, c) in the output_grid to Red (2).
8.  Return the modified output_grid.
