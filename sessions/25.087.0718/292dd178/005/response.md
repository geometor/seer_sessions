"""
The transformation identifies regions of white (color 0) that are completely enclosed by other, non-white colors within the input grid. These enclosed white regions are then filled with red (color 2).

The process involves:
1. Defining white (0) as the specific 'background' color to check for enclosure.
2. Defining red (2) as the fill color.
3. Identifying all white pixels that are connected to the border of the grid using a flood fill algorithm (like Breadth-First Search). These are the 'external' white pixels.
4. Creating a copy of the input grid.
5. Iterating through the grid. Any pixel that is white (0) but was *not* reached by the border flood fill is considered 'enclosed'.
6. Changing the color of these enclosed white pixels to red (2) in the copied grid.
7. Returning the modified grid.
