task_description: Fill enclosed regions of a specific background color with a designated fill color.

observations:
  - input_grids and output_grids are 2D arrays of integers (colors).
  - The transformation modifies specific regions within the input grid based on their color and spatial relationship to the grid border and surrounding colors.
  - A common pattern involves identifying areas of a single color that are not connected to the grid's edge through a path of the same color.
  - These "enclosed" areas are then filled with a different color.

hypotheses:
  - background_color_source: The color of the regions to be filled (the "background") might be determined by:
      - The color at grid position (0,0). (Initial assumption - likely flawed)
      - The most frequent color in the grid.
      - The most frequent color along the border.
      - Always being a specific color (e.g., white '0').
  - fill_color_source: The color used to fill the enclosed regions appears to be red (2) based on the initial analysis, but this needs confirmation across all examples.
  - definition_of_enclosed: A region is enclosed if it consists of contiguous pixels of the background color, and none of these pixels can reach the border of the grid by moving only through adjacent pixels of the same background color. Adjacency includes horizontal and vertical neighbors.

error_analysis:
  - The code failed comparison tests on all examples, indicating the generated output did not match the expected output.
  - The likely reason is an incorrect assumption made in the code, most probably the identification of the 'background' color using `input_grid[0][0]`.
