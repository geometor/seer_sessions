task_description: The goal is to modify the input grid by identifying specific regions based on color and location, and changing their color.

objects:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels, each having a color value (0-9).
    properties:
      - dimensions (height, width)
      - pixels (cells with color values)
  - type: region
    description: A contiguous area of pixels sharing the same color.
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - pixels (list of coordinates (row, col))
      - connectivity (usually 4-directional adjacency)
  - type: boundary
    description: The set of pixels forming the outer edge of the grid.

parameters:
  - target_color: The color of the regions to potentially modify (e.g., white = 0).
  - fill_color: The color used to replace the target color in specific conditions (e.g., red = 2).

actions:
  - action: identify_border_connected_regions
    description: Finds all pixels of the target_color that are connected to the grid boundary via a path of target_color pixels.
    input:
      - grid
      - target_color
    method: Typically Flood Fill (BFS or DFS) starting from target_color pixels on the boundary.
    output: A set of coordinates or a boolean grid marking these 'external' pixels.
  - action: identify_enclosed_pixels
    description: Finds all pixels of the target_color that are *not* connected to the grid boundary.
    input:
      - grid
      - target_color
      - external_pixels_mask (output from previous action)
    method: Iterate through the grid. A pixel is enclosed if it has the target_color and is *not* marked as external.
    output: A set of coordinates of enclosed pixels.
  - action: recolor_pixels
    description: Changes the color of specified pixels in the grid.
    input:
      - grid (a copy to be modified)
      - pixel_coordinates (e.g., the enclosed pixels)
      - new_color (the fill_color)
    output: Modified grid.

transformation_rule:
  1. Define the target color as white (0) and the fill color as red (2).
  2. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
  3. Identify all white pixels connected to the grid boundary (external white pixels).
  4. Iterate through all pixels in the input grid.
  5. If a pixel is white (0) AND it was NOT identified as an external white pixel, change its color to red (2) in the output grid.
  6. Return the modified output grid.
