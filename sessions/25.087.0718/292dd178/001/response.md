"""
The transformation identifies regions of the background color that are completely enclosed by a foreground color (blue=1 in the examples) and fills these enclosed regions with red (2).

1.  Identify the background color (assumed to be the color of the top-left pixel).
2.  Identify the foreground color that forms the enclosures (blue=1 in the examples).
3.  Find all background pixels connected to the border of the grid using a flood fill (BFS or DFS) starting from the border pixels. These are the "exterior" background pixels.
4.  Iterate through the grid. Any background pixel that was *not* reached by the flood fill is an "interior" or "enclosed" background pixel.
5.  Change the color of these enclosed background pixels to red (2).
6.  Leave all other pixels (foreground pixels and exterior background pixels) unchanged.
