These objects are scattered across a larger white background. The objects often resemble plus signs ('+'), 'X' shapes, or diamonds, but they are defined simply as contiguous blocks of the same color.\n2.  **Output Grids:** The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. They contain the same objects found in the input, but extracted and arranged differently.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying each distinct non-white object in the input grid. For each object, its minimal bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing the object) is determined. The content within this bounding box is extracted. These extracted object subgrids are then stacked vertically in the output grid, preserving their original colors and relative pixel positions within their bounding boxes. The order of stacking seems to correspond to the order the objects are encountered, likely scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right based on the top-left corner of their bounding boxes. The final output grid's width is determined by the maximum width of any extracted object's bounding box. The height is the sum of the heights of all extracted bounding boxes.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
