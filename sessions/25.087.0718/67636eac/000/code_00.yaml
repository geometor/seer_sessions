task_description: Extract non-white objects based on their minimal bounding boxes and stack them vertically in the output.

elements:
  - role: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
  - role: object
    properties:
      color: non-white (1-9)
      shape: contiguous block of a single color
      count: multiple per input grid
      location: scattered within the input grid

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects are separated by the white background in the input.
  - type: transformation
    description: Each non-white object from the input is individually processed and contributes to the output.

actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list of non-white objects (represented by their pixels and locations)
    description: Find all connected components of non-white pixels.
  - name: calculate_bounding_box
    inputs: object
    outputs: bounding_box (top-left corner coordinates, height, width)
    description: Determine the minimum rectangle enclosing all pixels of the object.
  - name: extract_object_subgrid
    inputs: input_grid, bounding_box
    outputs: subgrid (containing the object cropped to its bounding box)
    description: Crop the portion of the input grid defined by the object's bounding box.
  - name: stack_subgrids
    inputs: list of extracted subgrids
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Arrange the extracted subgrids vertically, one below the other, aligning them to the left. The final width is the maximum width among all subgrids.

output_properties:
  - property: composition
    value: Concatenation of extracted object subgrids.
  - property: arrangement
    value: Vertical stacking.
  - property: order
    value: Determined by the order of objects found in the input (likely top-to-bottom, left-to-right based on bounding box top-left corner).
  - property: dimensions
    value: Width is the maximum width of any extracted subgrid; height is the sum of the heights of all extracted subgrids.
