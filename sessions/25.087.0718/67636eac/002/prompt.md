"""
Identify all distinct non-white objects in the input grid.
For each object, determine its minimal bounding box and extract the corresponding subgrid.
Sort these extracted subgrids based on the top-to-bottom, then left-to-right position of the top-left corner of their bounding boxes in the original input grid.
Construct the output grid by vertically stacking the sorted subgrids.
The width of the output grid is the maximum width among all extracted subgrids. Pad narrower subgrids with the background color (white, 0) on the right if necessary.
The height of the output grid is the sum of the heights of all extracted subgrids.
