            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this ARC task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Composition**: Each input grid contains two distinct types of elements against a white (0) background:\n    *   A single \"template\" object made of blue (1) pixels. This template always seems to fit within a 3x3 bounding box.\n    *   One or more single \"color pixels\". These pixels have colors other than white (0) or blue (1) (e.g., red, green, yellow, magenta, azure). They appear scattered in the input grid, spatially separate from the blue template.\n\n2.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grid is always larger than the 3x3 template but smaller than the input grid. It appears to be constructed by:\n    *   Taking the shape defined by the blue template.\n    *   Creating multiple copies of this shape.\n    *   Filling each copy's shape (where the template had blue pixels) with one of the \"color pixel\" colors found in the input. The background of the template (where it had white pixels) remains white in the output copies.\n    *   Arranging these colored copies adjacent to each other, either horizontally or vertically, to form the final output grid.\n\n3.  **Transformation Pattern**: The core transformation involves using the blue shape as a stencil and applying the distinct colors found elsewhere in the input onto copies of this stencil. The arrangement (horizontal vs. vertical concatenation) and the order of the colored stencils in the output seem dependent on the relative spatial arrangement of the original color pixels in the input.\n\n4.  **Ordering and Arrangement**:\n    *   If the color pixels in the input are primarily arranged horizontally (i.e., they span a wider range of columns than rows), the resulting colored templates are concatenated horizontally in the output. The left-to-right order in the output corresponds to the left-to-right order of the color pixels in the input.\n    *   If the color pixels in the input are primarily arranged vertically (i.e., they span a wider range of rows than columns), the resulting colored templates are concatenated vertically in the output. The top-to-bottom order in the output corresponds to the top-to-bottom order of the color pixels in the input.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Determine the smallest bounding box that encloses all blue pixels. Extract this subgrid; this is the 3x3 \"template\".\n2.  **Identify Color Pixels:** Scan the input grid to find all pixels whose color is *not* white (0) and *not* blue (1). Record the color value and the (row, column) coordinates of each such \"color pixel\".\n3.  **Determine Arrangement and Order:**\n    a.  Examine the coordinates of the identified color pixels. Find the minimum and maximum row indices (`min_row`, `max_row`) and the minimum and maximum column indices (`min_col`, `max_col`).\n    b.  Calculate the row range (`row_range = max_row - min_row`) and column range (`col_range = max_col - min_col`).\n    c.  If `row_range` is strictly greater than `col_range`, the arrangement is **vertical**. Sort the color pixels primarily by their row index, and secondarily by their column index (for tie-breaking).\n    d.  Otherwise (if `col_range >= row_range` or there's only one color pixel), the arrangement is **horizontal**. Sort the color pixels primarily by their column index, and secondarily by their row index.\n4.  **Generate Colored Blocks:** Create an empty list to store the output blocks. Iterate through the *sorted* color pixels from the previous step:\n    a.  For each color pixel, take its color value.\n    b.  Create a new 3x3 grid by copying the template found in Step 1.\n    c.  In this new grid, replace every cell containing the blue (1) value with the current color pixel's value. Leave the white (0) cells unchanged.\n    d.  Add this newly created 3x3 colored block to the list of output blocks.\n5.  **Assemble Final Output:** Concatenate the generated 3x3 colored blocks together:\n    a.  If the arrangement determined in Step 3 was **vertical**, stack the blocks vertically in the order they were generated.\n    b.  If the arrangement determined in Step 3 was **horizontal**, place the blocks side-by-side horizontally in the order they were generated.\n6.  The resulting combined grid is the final output."
