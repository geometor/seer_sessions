Input Grid Properties:
  - Size: 15x15
  - Contains:
    - Background_Color: A single dominant color (non-white).
    - Foreground_Pixels: One or more pixels with color white (0).

Output Grid Properties:
  - Size: 3x3
  - Contains:
    - Background_Color: Same as the input grid's background color.
    - Foreground_Pixels: Pixels with color white (0).

Transformation:
  - Type: Downscaling
  - Scaling_Factor: 5 (Input dimension / Output dimension = 15 / 3 = 5)
  - Mapping: Each 5x5 block in the input maps to one pixel in the output.
  - Rule:
    - Identify the background color of the input grid (the non-white color).
    - Create a 3x3 output grid initialized with the background color.
    - Iterate through the input grid in 5x5 blocks (block indices [0,0], [0,1], [0,2], [1,0], ... [2,2]).
    - For each 5x5 block:
      - If any pixel within the block has the color white (0):
        - Set the corresponding pixel in the output grid (at the block index) to white (0).
      - Else:
        - Keep the corresponding pixel in the output grid as the background color.
