            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n## Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** The input grid contains mostly white pixels (0) and one or more colored pixels. The significant colored pixel appears to be red (2). Other colors, like blue (1), may also be present.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid retains the original non-red pixels from the input. The original red pixels also remain. Additionally, new red pixels appear, forming diagonal patterns originating from the initial red pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves generating a diagonal \"trail\" or \"shadow\" for each red pixel found in the input. This trail extends upwards and to the right.\n4.  **Trail Shape:** The trail seems to be composed of pixels along the main diagonal path (moving one step up and one step right) starting from the pixel *above* the original red pixel, plus adjacent pixels that create a roughly 2-pixel wide diagonal band.\n5.  **Interaction:** The generated red trail pixels overwrite the white background pixels (0). However, if the trail path encounters a non-white, non-red pixel from the original input grid (like blue), the original pixel's color is preserved, and the red trail does not overwrite it at that specific location.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Continue this iteration as long as `r_trail` is non-negative (within the grid height) and `c_trail` is less than the grid width.\n    c.  In each step of the iteration, add the following coordinates to the set of potential trail pixels, provided they are within the grid boundaries:\n        i.  The main diagonal point: `(r_trail, c_trail)`\n        ii. The point below the main diagonal: `(r_trail + 1, c_trail)`\n        iii. The point to the right of the main diagonal: `(r_trail, c_trail + 1)`\n    d.  Decrement `r_trail` by 1 and increment `c_trail` by 1 for the next step.\n5.  Iterate through all the coordinates `(tr, tc)` stored in the set of potential trail pixels.\n6.  For each potential trail coordinate `(tr, tc)`:\n    a.  Check the color of the pixel at `(tr, tc)` in the *original* input grid.\n    b.  If the original pixel color is white (0), update the pixel at `(tr, tc)` in the output grid to red (2).\n7.
