Observations:
  - Grid_Size: Consistent 10x10 in examples.
  - Background_Color: Predominantly white (0).
  - Active_Color: Red (2) pixels initiate the primary action.
  - Obstacle_Colors: Other colors, like blue (1), act as obstacles or static elements.
  - Transformation_Type: Pattern generation based on specific pixel color and position.

Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Red (2)
      - role: Emitter (generates a trail)
      - initial_position: (row, col)
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Blue (1) or other non-red, non-white
      - role: Obstacle / Static (persists, blocks trail overwrite)
      - initial_position: (row, col)
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: White (0)
      - role: Background (can be overwritten by trail)

Actions:
  - name: Generate_Trail
    actor: Red Pixel at (r, c)
    effect: Creates a set of new red pixel coordinates.
    details:
      - The trail propagates diagonally upwards and to the right (r-1, c+1), (r-2, c+2), ... until grid boundaries.
      - For each point (r', c') on this diagonal path, add red pixels at (r', c'), (r', c'+1), and (r'+1, c').
      - Ensure coordinates are within grid bounds.
  - name: Combine_And_Overwrite
    inputs:
      - Original_Grid
      - Generated_Trail_Pixels
    output: Final_Output_Grid
    details:
      - Start with a copy of the input grid.
      - For each coordinate (tr, tc) in the generated trail pixels:
        - If the pixel at (tr, tc) in the *original* input grid is white (0), set the pixel at (tr, tc) in the output grid to red (2).
        - If the pixel at (tr, tc) in the original input grid is *not* white (0), it retains its original color in the output grid (i.e., the trail does not overwrite existing non-white pixels).
      - Original red pixels from the input also remain red in the output.

Relationships:
  - The trail originates from *each* red pixel in the input independently.
  - The generated trail respects grid boundaries.
  - Existing non-white pixels take precedence over the generated red trail.
