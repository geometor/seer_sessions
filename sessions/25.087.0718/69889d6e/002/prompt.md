```python
"""
Identifies all red (2) pixels in the input grid. For each red pixel, generates a 
diagonal trail extending upwards and to the right. The trail consists of pixels 
on the main diagonal path starting one step above and one step right of the 
original red pixel, plus adjacent pixels forming a roughly 2-pixel wide band. 
Specifically, for a trail point (r_t, c_t) on the diagonal, the trail also includes 
(r_t + 1, c_t) and (r_t, c_t + 1), provided these points are within grid bounds. 
The generated trail pixels overwrite white (0) background pixels in the output 
grid. Existing non-white pixels from the input grid are preserved and are not 
overwritten by the trail.
