Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grid contains mostly white pixels (0) and one or more colored pixels. The significant colored pixel appears to be red (2). Other colors, like blue (1), may also be present.
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid retains the original non-red pixels from the input. The original red pixels also remain. Additionally, new red pixels appear, forming diagonal patterns originating from the initial red pixels.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves generating a diagonal "trail" or "shadow" for each red pixel found in the input. This trail extends upwards and to the right.
4.  **Trail Shape:** The trail seems to be composed of pixels along the main diagonal path (moving one step up and one step right) starting from the pixel *above* the original red pixel, plus adjacent pixels that create a roughly 2-pixel wide diagonal band.
5.  **Interaction:** The generated red trail pixels overwrite the white background pixels (0). However, if the trail path encounters a non-white, non-red pixel from the original input grid (like blue), the original pixel's color is preserved, and the red trail does not overwrite it at that specific location.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Observations:
  - Grid_Size: Consistent 10x10 in examples.
  - Background_Color: Predominantly white (0).
  - Active_Color: Red (2) pixels initiate the primary action.
  - Obstacle_Colors: Other colors, like blue (1), act as obstacles or static elements.
  - Transformation_Type: Pattern generation based on specific pixel color and position.

Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Red (2)
      - role: Emitter (generates a trail)
      - initial_position: (row, col)
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Blue (1) or other non-red, non-white
      - role: Obstacle / Static (persists, blocks trail overwrite)
      - initial_position: (row, col)
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: White (0)
      - role: Background (can be overwritten by trail)

Actions:
  - name: Generate_Trail
    actor: Red Pixel at (r, c)
    effect: Creates a set of new red pixel coordinates.
    details:
      - The trail propagates diagonally upwards and to the right (r-1, c+1), (r-2, c+2), ... until grid boundaries.
      - For each point (r', c') on this diagonal path, add red pixels at (r', c'), (r', c'+1), and (r'+1, c').
      - Ensure coordinates are within grid bounds.
  - name: Combine_And_Overwrite
    inputs:
      - Original_Grid
      - Generated_Trail_Pixels
    output: Final_Output_Grid
    details:
      - Start with a copy of the input grid.
      - For each coordinate (tr, tc) in the generated trail pixels:
        - If the pixel at (tr, tc) in the *original* input grid is white (0), set the pixel at (tr, tc) in the output grid to red (2).
        - If the pixel at (tr, tc) in the original input grid is *not* white (0), it retains its original color in the output grid (i.e., the trail does not overwrite existing non-white pixels).
      - Original red pixels from the input also remain red in the output.

Relationships:
  - The trail originates from *each* red pixel in the input independently.
  - The generated trail respects grid boundaries.
  - Existing non-white pixels take precedence over the generated red trail.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the coordinates `(r, c)` of all red (2) pixels in the input grid.
3.  Create an empty set to store the coordinates of the potential trail pixels.
4.  For each identified red pixel at `(r, c)`:
    a.  Iterate diagonally upwards and to the right, starting from the position `(r-1, c+1)`. Let the current trail position be `(r_trail, c_trail)`.
    b.  Continue this iteration as long as `r_trail` is non-negative (within the grid height) and `c_trail` is less than the grid width.
    c.  In each step of the iteration, add the following coordinates to the set of potential trail pixels, provided they are within the grid boundaries:
        i.  The main diagonal point: `(r_trail, c_trail)`
        ii. The point below the main diagonal: `(r_trail + 1, c_trail)`
        iii. The point to the right of the main diagonal: `(r_trail, c_trail + 1)`
    d.  Decrement `r_trail` by 1 and increment `c_trail` by 1 for the next step.
5.  Iterate through all the coordinates `(tr, tc)` stored in the set of potential trail pixels.
6.  For each potential trail coordinate `(tr, tc)`:
    a.  Check the color of the pixel at `(tr, tc)` in the *original* input grid.
    b.  If the original pixel color is white (0), update the pixel at `(tr, tc)` in the output grid to red (2).
7.  The final state of the output grid is the result.
