The trail consists of pixels \non the main diagonal path starting one step above and one step right of the \noriginal red pixel, plus adjacent pixels forming a roughly 2-pixel wide band. \nSpecifically, for a trail point (r_t, c_t) on the diagonal, the trail also includes \n(r_t + 1, c_t) and (r_t, c_t + 1), provided these points are within grid bounds. \nThe generated trail pixels overwrite white (0) background pixels in the output \ngrid.
