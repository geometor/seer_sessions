**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids vary in size and have a single background color (Azure, Gray, or Blue in the examples). Scattered within the grid are objects of Green (3) and Red (2).
2.  **Objects:** The objects appear to be contiguous horizontal line segments (1 pixel high, variable width) of either Green or Red color. They do not touch each other.
3.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is consistently small, specifically 2x3.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve counting the number of Green objects and Red objects in the input grid and representing these counts within the fixed-size output grid.
5.  **Output Representation:** The 2x3 output grid is filled sequentially (left-to-right, top-to-bottom). First, a number of cells equal to the count of Green input objects are filled with Green (3). Then, the next cells are filled with Red (2), corresponding to the count of Red input objects. Any remaining cells in the 2x3 grid are filled with White (0).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Count specific colored horizontal lines and represent counts in a fixed grid.

Input:
  Grid:
    Size: Variable (e.g., 10x19, 10x10, 10x14, 13x15)
    Background Color: Uniform, varies between examples (Azure-8, Gray-5, Blue-1). Appears irrelevant to the core logic.
  Objects:
    Type: Contiguous horizontal line segments (1 pixel high).
    Colors: Green (3), Red (2).
    Arrangement: Scattered, non-overlapping.

Output:
  Grid:
    Size: Fixed (2x3).
    Colors: Green (3), Red (2), White (0).
    Content: Represents counts of input objects.

Transformation:
  Action: Identify and count specific objects based on color and shape.
  Object Identification: Find all distinct horizontal line segments of Green (3) and Red (2).
  Counting:
    - Count the number of Green segments (`count_green`).
    - Count the number of Red segments (`count_red`).
  Output Generation:
    - Create a 2x3 grid initialized with White (0).
    - Fill sequentially (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).
    - Place `count_green` Green (3) pixels.
    - Place `count_red` Red (2) pixels immediately following the Green pixels.
    - Remaining cells stay White (0).

Relationships:
  - The number of Green pixels in the output equals the number of Green horizontal line objects in the input.
  - The number of Red pixels in the output equals the number of Red horizontal line objects in the input.
  - The total number of Green and Red pixels in the output is less than or equal to 6 (the size of the output grid).
  - White pixels act as padding if the total count is less than 6.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize two counters: `green_line_count` to 0 and `red_line_count` to 0.
2.  Examine the input grid to locate all distinct, contiguous horizontal segments composed entirely of Green (3) pixels. For each distinct Green segment found, increment `green_line_count`.
3.  Examine the input grid to locate all distinct, contiguous horizontal segments composed entirely of Red (2) pixels. For each distinct Red segment found, increment `red_line_count`.
4.  Create a new 2x3 grid, initializing all cells to the White (0) color.
5.  Define a sequence for filling the 2x3 grid: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).
6.  Fill the first `green_line_count` cells in the sequence with the Green (3) color.
7.  Starting from the cell immediately following the last Green cell, fill the next `red_line_count` cells in the sequence with the Red (2) color.
8.  Ensure any remaining cells in the 2x3 grid retain their initial White (0) color.
9.  The final 2x3 grid is the result.
