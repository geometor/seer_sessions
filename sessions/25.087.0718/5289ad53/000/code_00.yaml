Task: Count specific colored horizontal lines and represent counts in a fixed grid.

Input:
  Grid:
    Size: Variable (e.g., 10x19, 10x10, 10x14, 13x15)
    Background Color: Uniform, varies between examples (Azure-8, Gray-5, Blue-1). Appears irrelevant to the core logic.
  Objects:
    Type: Contiguous horizontal line segments (1 pixel high).
    Colors: Green (3), Red (2).
    Arrangement: Scattered, non-overlapping.

Output:
  Grid:
    Size: Fixed (2x3).
    Colors: Green (3), Red (2), White (0).
    Content: Represents counts of input objects.

Transformation:
  Action: Identify and count specific objects based on color and shape.
  Object Identification: Find all distinct horizontal line segments of Green (3) and Red (2).
  Counting:
    - Count the number of Green segments (`count_green`).
    - Count the number of Red segments (`count_red`).
  Output Generation:
    - Create a 2x3 grid initialized with White (0).
    - Fill sequentially (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).
    - Place `count_green` Green (3) pixels.
    - Place `count_red` Red (2) pixels immediately following the Green pixels.
    - Remaining cells stay White (0).

Relationships:
  - The number of Green pixels in the output equals the number of Green horizontal line objects in the input.
  - The number of Red pixels in the output equals the number of Red horizontal line objects in the input.
  - The total number of Green and Red pixels in the output is less than or equal to 6 (the size of the output grid).
  - White pixels act as padding if the total count is less than 6.
