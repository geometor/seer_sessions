Scattered within the grid are objects of Green (3) and Red (2).\n2.  **Objects:** The objects appear to be contiguous horizontal line segments (1 pixel high, variable width) of either Green or Red color. They do not touch each other.\n3.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is consistently small, specifically 2x3.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve counting the number of Green objects and Red objects in the input grid and representing these counts within the fixed-size output grid.\n5.  **Output Representation:** The 2x3 output grid is filled sequentially (left-to-right, top-to-bottom). First, a number of cells equal to the count of Green input objects are filled with Green (3). Then, the next cells are filled with Red (2), corresponding to the count of Red input objects. Any remaining cells in the 2x3 grid are filled with White (0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
