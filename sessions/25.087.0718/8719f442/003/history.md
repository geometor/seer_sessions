"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid into a 15x15 output grid.
The output grid is composed of a 3x3 arrangement of 5x5 blocks.
Each 5x5 block in the output corresponds to a pixel in the input grid.
If an input pixel is white (0), the corresponding 5x5 output block is entirely white (0).
If an input pixel is gray (5), the corresponding 5x5 output block contains a copy of the original 3x3 input grid, centered within the 5x5 block and padded with white (0).

Ah, the `bool` type from numpy (`np.bool_`) isn't directly JSON serializable. Let's cast the boolean flags to Python's native `bool`.

## General Assessment

The previous code attempted to solve the task by scaling the 3x3 input grid by 5x to produce a 15x15 output grid. It identified two input pixel colors: white (0) and gray (5). The logic was: if the input pixel is white, the corresponding 5x5 output block is all white; if the input pixel is gray, the corresponding 5x5 output block contains a centered copy of the original 3x3 input grid, padded with white.

However, the execution results showed significant mismatches ("Pixels Off") between the transformed output and the expected output for all training examples. My initial re-analysis suggested the code logic *matched* the expected input/output pairs, implying an error in the reported results.

The detailed metrics gathered using `tool_code` reveal a crucial finding: **the expected outputs do *not* follow the rule of simply copying the input grid into the gray blocks.** The metrics show `extracted_pattern_matches_input: false` and `padding_is_white: false` for *all* gray input pixels across *all* examples. Furthermore, `all_white_blocks_correct` is false for examples 2 and 3, meaning even the white blocks aren't always entirely white in the expected outputs.

This indicates the transformation is more complex. The error wasn't in the execution report, but in the initial interpretation derived only from the first example (or a superficial look at others). The content placed in the 5x5 blocks depends on more than just the color of the single corresponding input pixel. The non-white padding suggests interactions *between* the 5x5 blocks.

**Strategy Revision:** Re-examine the *Expected Outputs* carefully, looking for how the patterns placed for gray pixels are formed and why padding/white blocks might contain non-white pixels. The interaction likely involves overwriting or combining patterns based on neighboring input pixels.

## Metrics Analysis

The `tool_code` execution provided detailed metrics confirming the discrepancies:

*   **Input/Output Shapes:** Consistently 3x3 input, 15x15 output. Scale factor is 5x.
*   **White Pixels (Input=0):**
    *   Example 1: Corresponding 5x5 output blocks are correctly all white.
    *   Example 2 & 3: Some 5x5 output blocks corresponding to white input pixels *contain non-white pixels* (`all_white_blocks_correct: false`). This confirms overlap/interaction between blocks.
*   **Gray Pixels (Input=5):**
    *   Across all examples, the 3x3 pattern centered within the 5x5 block corresponding to a gray input pixel *does not match* the original input grid (`extracted_pattern_matches_input: false`).
    *   The padding around this centered 3x3 pattern is *not* always white (`padding_is_white: false`).

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The rule is *not* a simple per-pixel mapping with fixed patterns. The final state of a 5x5 output block is influenced by the transformations dictated by neighboring input pixels, leading to overlaps and modified patterns/padding. Specifically, when multiple input pixels dictate that their pattern should be written into overlapping areas of the output grid, the writes seem to combine.

Let's reconsider Example 1's Expected Output:
The central 5x5 block (corresponding to input (1,1)=5) contains the input pattern. But look at the pixels *around* it. For instance, output pixel (5,5) is white. It belongs to the block for input (1,1). However, it also falls within the 1-pixel padding area of the block for input (1,0)=5 and the block for input (0,1)=5. It seems the rule might be: write the input pattern centered for *every* gray pixel, potentially overwriting parts of blocks generated by other pixels (including white blocks).

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_structure:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D
  input_output_relation: One input grid transforms into one output grid.
  grid_size_relation: Output grid dimensions are 5 times the input grid dimensions.

grid_properties:
  input_size: 3x3
  output_size: 15x15
  scaling_factor: 5
  background_color: white (0)
  object_colors: [gray (5)] # Only gray objects seem active

transformation_rules:
  pixel_mapping: Each input pixel at (r_in, c_in) influences a 5x5 block in the output grid starting at (r_in * 5, c_in * 5).
  white_pixel_rule: If an input pixel is white (0), the corresponding 5x5 output block is initially considered all white (0).
  gray_pixel_rule: If an input pixel is gray (5), the original 3x3 input grid pattern is placed centered within the corresponding 5x5 output block (at offset (1,1) within the block).
  overlap_handling: When patterns from multiple gray input pixels are placed, they overwrite any existing pixels (including those from initially white blocks or padding areas of other blocks) in the output grid. The final output is the result of all such pattern placements.

objects:
  - type: Background Grid
    properties: Base canvas for input and output, primarily white (0).
  - type: Input Pattern
    properties: The entire 3x3 input grid configuration.
    location: Relative concept, represents the data to be copied.
  - type: Active Pixel (Gray)
    properties: Input pixels with value gray (5).
    action: Triggers the placement of the Input Pattern into a specific location in the output grid.
  - type: Passive Pixel (White)
    properties: Input pixels with value white (0).
    action: Initially designates a corresponding 5x5 area in the output as white, but this can be overwritten by patterns from neighboring Active Pixels.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize a 15x15 output grid filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
2.  Identify the input grid pattern (the original 3x3 input).
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the 3x3 input grid at position (row `r_in`, column `c_in`).
4.  If the input pixel at (`r_in`, `c_in`) is gray (5):
    a.  Calculate the top-left corner (`R_out`, `C_out`) for placing the 3x3 input pattern centered within the corresponding 5x5 block in the output grid. This position is (`r_in` * 5 + 1, `c_in` * 5 + 1).
    b.  Copy the entire 3x3 input grid pattern onto the output grid starting at position (`R_out`, `C_out`), overwriting any pixels already present in that 3x3 area.
5.  After iterating through all input pixels, the final state of the output grid represents the result. (Pixels initially set to white in step 1 remain white unless overwritten in step 4b).
