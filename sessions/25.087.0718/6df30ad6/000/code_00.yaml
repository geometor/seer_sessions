task_description: Recolor the largest contiguous object based on the color of the nearest non-background, non-object pixel.

definitions:
  - &background_color 0 # white
  - &target_object_input_color 5 # gray
  - &target_object
    description: The largest contiguous block of non-background pixels in the input. In all examples, this object's color is gray (5).
    properties:
      - contiguity: forms a single connected component (adjacency includes diagonals).
      - size: largest by pixel count compared to other non-background components.
  - &source_pixels
    description: All pixels in the input grid that are not the background color and do not belong to the target_object.
    properties:
      - color: Varies across examples (e.g., magenta, maroon, orange, red, yellow, azure, green).
      - distribution: Scattered across the grid, often appearing as single pixels.
  - &output_object
    description: The single object present in the output grid.
    properties:
      - shape: Identical shape and position as the target_object from the input.
      - color: Determined by a specific rule involving source_pixels.

transformation_rule:
  - step: 1
    action: identify_target_object
    description: Find the largest contiguous block of non-background pixels in the input grid. Note its constituent pixel coordinates and original color (always gray=5 in examples).
  - step: 2
    action: identify_source_pixels
    description: Find all other non-background pixels in the input grid (those not part of the target_object). Note their coordinates and colors.
  - step: 3
    action: calculate_min_distances
    description: For each unique color `C` found among the source_pixels, calculate the minimum Manhattan distance from any source pixel of color `C` to any pixel of the target_object.
    details:
      - Manhattan distance between (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) is |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|.
      - Find the minimum distance over all pairs of (source_pixel_of_color_C, target_object_pixel).
  - step: 4
    action: determine_replacement_color
    description: Identify the source color(s) that yielded the overall minimum Manhattan distance in step 3.
    tie_breaking: If multiple source colors share the same minimum distance, select the color with the highest numerical value. This is the replacement_color.
  - step: 5
    action: generate_output
    description: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background_color (0).
  - step: 6
    action: paint_output_object
    description: For every pixel coordinate that belonged to the target_object in the input, set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the replacement_color determined in step 4.

examples_summary:
  - train_1: Target=gray(5), Sources=[magenta(6), maroon(9), orange(7)]. Min dist for 6 is 2. Output=magenta(6).
  - train_2: Target=gray(5), Sources=[maroon(9), red(2), yellow(4)]. Min dist for 9 and 2 is 2. Tie-break: 9 > 2. Output=maroon(9).
  - train_3: Target=gray(5), Sources=[azure(8), yellow(4), green(3)]. Min dist for 4 is 2. Output=yellow(4).
  - train_4: Target=gray(5), Sources=[yellow(4), green(3), magenta(6)]. Min dist for 6 is 2. Output=magenta(6).
  - train_5: Target=gray(5), Sources=[yellow(4), magenta(6)]. Min dist for 4 is 3. Output=yellow(4).
