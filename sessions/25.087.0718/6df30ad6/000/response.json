            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains multiple colored pixels on a white (0) background. There is consistently one larger, contiguous object composed of gray (5) pixels. Additionally, there are several scattered, single pixels of various other colors (non-white, non-gray).\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** Each output grid contains only one object, which occupies the exact same positions as the large gray object from the corresponding input grid. All other pixels are white (0). The color of this single object in the output is *not* gray.\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task appears to be identifying the main gray object, determining a new color for it based on the nearby scattered pixels, and then redrawing only that object in the new color, removing all other non-background pixels.\n4.  **Color Selection Logic:** The color used to repaint the gray object in the output seems to be derived from one of the scattered pixels in the input. By comparing inputs and outputs:\n    *   Train 1: Scattered pixels include magenta (6), maroon (9), orange (7). Output object is magenta (6).\n    *   Train 2: Scattered pixels include maroon (9), red (2), yellow (4). Output object is maroon (9).\n    *   Train 3: Scattered pixels include azure (8), yellow (4), green (3). Output object is yellow (4).\n    *   Train 4: Scattered pixels include yellow (4), green (3), magenta (6). Output object is magenta (6).\n    *   Train 5: Scattered pixels include yellow (4), magenta (6). Output object is yellow (4).\n5.  **Proximity Rule:** The selection of the output color likely depends on proximity. The scattered pixel whose color is used in the output appears to be the \"closest\" to the central gray object. \"Closest\" is likely measured by Manhattan distance (sum of row and column differences) between a scattered pixel and the nearest pixel of the gray object.\n6.  **Tie-breaking:** In Train 2, both maroon (9) and red (2) pixels seem to have the same minimum distance (2) to the gray object. The output uses maroon (9). This suggests that if multiple colors share the minimum distance, the color with the highest numerical value is chosen.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
