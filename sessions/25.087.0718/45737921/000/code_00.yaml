  - name: Grid Structure
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
      dimensionality: 2D
      cell_values: integers 0-9

  - name: Objects
    description: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels form distinct objects.
    properties:
      composition: Each object consists of pixels of exactly two different non-white colors.
      separation: Objects are separated by white pixels.
      structure: Contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.

  - name: Transformation Action
    description: Within each object, the two constituent non-white colors swap places.
    type: Color Swap
    scope: Intra-object
    effect: For an object made of Color A and Color B, all Color A pixels become Color B, and all Color B pixels become Color A.

  - name: Invariant Elements
    description: Elements that remain unchanged during the transformation.
    elements:
      - White background pixels
      - Object shape
      - Object size
      - Object position
      - Number of objects
