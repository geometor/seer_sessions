The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct, separate objects within the grid. Each object is composed of pixels of exactly two different non-white colors.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens *within* each distinct object. The two non-white colors that constitute an object appear to swap their positions. If an object is made of Color A and Color B, every pixel that was Color A becomes Color B, and every pixel that was Color B becomes Color A.\n4.  **Invariance:** The white background pixels remain unchanged. The overall shape, size, and position of each object remain unchanged. Only the colors *within* the object are modified.\n5.  **Isolation:** The transformation applied to one object does not affect any other object or the background.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
