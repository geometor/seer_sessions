Examples:
  - Example: 1
    Input:
      Grid_Dimensions: [3, 3]
      Background_Color: 0 (white)
      Non_Background_Colors:
        - Color: 1 (blue)
          Count: 3
        - Color: 2 (red)
          Count: 1
      Total_Non_Background_Colors: 2
    Output:
      Grid_Dimensions: [3, 3]
      Background_Color: 0 (white)
      Non_Background_Colors:
        - Color: 2 (red)
          Count: 3
        - Color: 1 (blue)
          Count: 1
    Transformation: Color 1 becomes Color 2, Color 2 becomes Color 1.
  - Example: 2
    Input:
      Grid_Dimensions: [5, 5]
      Background_Color: 0 (white)
      Non_Background_Colors:
        - Color: 3 (green)
          Count: 8
        - Color: 4 (yellow)
          Count: 1
      Total_Non_Background_Colors: 2
    Output:
      Grid_Dimensions: [5, 5]
      Background_Color: 0 (white)
      Non_Background_Colors:
        - Color: 4 (yellow)
          Count: 8
        - Color: 3 (green)
          Count: 1
    Transformation: Color 3 becomes Color 4, Color 4 becomes Color 3.
  - Example: 3
    Input:
      Grid_Dimensions: [4, 4]
      Background_Color: 0 (white)
      Non_Background_Colors:
        - Color: 5 (gray)
          Count: 4
        - Color: 6 (magenta)
          Count: 1
      Total_Non_Background_Colors: 2
    Output:
      Grid_Dimensions: [4, 4]
      Background_Color: 0 (white)
      Non_Background_Colors:
        - Color: 6 (magenta)
          Count: 4
        - Color: 5 (gray)
          Count: 1
    Transformation: Color 5 becomes Color 6, Color 6 becomes Color 5.

Global_Observations:
  - All examples use white (0) as the background color, which remains unchanged.
  - All input grids contain exactly two distinct non-background colors (e.g., Color A and Color B).
  - In all examples, the output grid is identical to the input grid except that all pixels originally of Color A are changed to Color B, and all pixels originally of Color B are changed to Color A.
  - The transformation depends only on the global presence of exactly two non-background colors.
