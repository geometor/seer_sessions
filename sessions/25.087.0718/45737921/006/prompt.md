"""
Transforms the input grid based on the global count of unique non-background colors.
If exactly two distinct non-background colors (e.g., Color A and Color B) are present 
in the entire input grid, all occurrences of Color A are replaced with Color B, and 
all occurrences of Color B are replaced with Color A. Pixels with the background 
color (0) remain unchanged. If the number of unique non-background colors in the 
input grid is not exactly two, the grid is returned unchanged.
