task_description: Swap two colors globally if the grid contains exactly two non-background colors.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width in all examples.
  - background_color: White (0) pixels remain unchanged and act as separators.

color_analysis:
  - condition: Identify the set of unique non-background colors present in the entire input grid.
  - case_1: If the set contains exactly two distinct colors (Color A and Color B).
    action: Replace all instances of Color A with Color B, and all instances of Color B with Color A throughout the grid.
  - case_2: If the set contains fewer than two or more than two distinct non-background colors.
    action: The grid remains unchanged.

objects:
  - definition: Contiguous areas of non-background colors (connected orthogonally).
  - relevance: While objects can be identified, the transformation rule appears to depend on the global color palette, not the color composition of individual objects. Objects are simply collections of pixels affected by the global color swap rule if it applies.
