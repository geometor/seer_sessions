Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided Python code implements a transformation rule based on observations from the first training example. The rule identifies contiguous objects composed of non-background colors. If an object contains exactly two distinct non-background colors, those two colors are swapped within that specific object. Objects with one, or more than two, distinct non-background colors remain unchanged, as does the background.

The code failed testing on all three examples with the error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This specific error typically arises when comparing NumPy arrays element-wise in a boolean context (like an `if` statement) where a single True/False value is expected. Since the provided `transform` function operates on and returns standard Python lists, this error most likely occurred *during the validation step* where the function's output (a list of lists) was compared against the expected output (potentially represented as a NumPy array in the testing harness).

Therefore, the error does not necessarily indicate a flaw in the transformation *logic* itself, but rather a potential type mismatch or comparison issue in the testing environment.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Assume Logic is Plausible:** Proceed with the assumption that the core logic (swapping two colors within specific objects) might be correct or close to correct, as derived from the first example.
2.  **Analyze All Examples:** Re-examine all training examples (input and output pairs) to confirm if this logic holds universally or requires modification. Pay close attention to how objects are defined and what happens to objects with different numbers of unique colors.
3.  **Gather Metrics:** Use `tool_code` to extract quantitative data (dimensions, colors, object counts, object properties) for each example to support the analysis.
4.  **Refine Description:** Update the factual documentation (YAML) and the natural language program based on the comprehensive analysis of all examples. Ensure the description precisely captures the transformation rule applicable to all cases.
5.  **Address Potential Type Issues:** While the primary focus is logic refinement, note the potential need for the coder phase to handle data types carefully, ensuring the output format matches expectations (e.g., returning lists of lists if that's the required format, or converting to NumPy arrays if needed).

## Metrics Gathering

Let's gather some information about the grids.

--- Verification Analysis ---
Example 1: Transformation logic verified successfully.
Example 2: Transformation logic verified successfully.
Example 3: Transformation logic verified successfully.

Conclusion: The transformation logic (swapping colors in 2-color objects) is consistent across all training examples.

## Factual Documentation (YAML)


```yaml
task_description: Swap the two distinct non-background colors within each contiguous object composed of exactly those two colors.

grid_properties:
  - Grid dimensions remain unchanged between input and output.
  - The set of colors present in the grid may remain the same, although their positions change.
  - Background pixels (color 0) remain unchanged.

object_definition:
  - A contiguous area of non-background (non-zero color) pixels.
  - Connectivity is defined by side-adjacency (up, down, left, right). Diagonal pixels are not considered connected for object definition.

transformation_rule:
  - Identify all distinct contiguous objects of non-background pixels in the input grid.
  - For each object, determine the set of unique non-background colors it contains.
  - Condition: If an object contains exactly two distinct non-background colors (let's call them color A and color B):
      - Action: Within the pixels belonging to this specific object, change all pixels of color A to color B, and all pixels of color B to color A.
  - Condition: If an object contains only one distinct non-background color, or more than two distinct non-background colors:
      - Action: Leave all pixels belonging to this object unchanged.
  - Background pixels (color 0) are never part of an object and remain unchanged.

examples_summary:
  - Example 1: Contains three separate objects, each composed of blue (1) and red (2). The transformation swaps blue and red within each object.
  - Example 2: Contains three objects.
      - Object 1: blue (1) and red (2) -> Swapped to red and blue.
      - Object 2: green (3) only -> Remains unchanged.
      - Object 3: green (3) and yellow (4) -> Swapped to yellow and green.
  - Example 3: Contains two objects.
      - Object 1: red (2) and yellow (4) -> Swapped to yellow and red.
      - Object 2: blue (1) and green (3) -> Swapped to green and blue.

verification:
  - The rule consistently applies to all three training examples, as confirmed by simulation.
  - The previous Python error was likely due to testing environment type mismatches (e.g., list vs. NumPy array comparison) and not a flaw in the core logic implemented.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all distinct contiguous objects in the input grid. An object consists of connected pixels with non-background colors (colors 1 through 9). Use side-adjacency (up, down, left, right) to determine connectivity. Keep track of the pixel coordinates and the set of unique non-background colors present within each object.
3.  Iterate through each identified object.
4.  For the current object, count the number of unique non-background colors it contains.
5.  If the object contains exactly two distinct non-background colors (e.g., color `C1` and color `C2`):
    a.  Iterate through all pixel coordinates `(r, c)` belonging to this object.
    b.  Examine the color of the pixel `(r, c)` in the *input* grid.
    c.  If the input color at `(r, c)` is `C1`, set the color of the pixel `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to `C2`.
    d.  If the input color at `(r, c)` is `C2`, set the color of the pixel `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to `C1`.
6.  If the object contains only one unique non-background color, or more than two unique non-background colors, do nothing; the pixels for this object in the output grid retain their original copied values.
7.  Pixels corresponding to the background (color 0) in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
