"""
Identifies distinct contiguous objects composed of non-background (non-zero) pixels.
For each object found, it determines the two unique non-background colors present within it.
It then iterates through the pixels of that object in the output grid (initially a copy of the input)
and swaps the two identified colors. Pixels that are part of objects not containing exactly two 
non-background colors, or background pixels (color 0), remain unchanged.
