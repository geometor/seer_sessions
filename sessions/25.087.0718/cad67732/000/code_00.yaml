task_description: Duplicate the input grid and place the two copies diagonally adjacent in an output grid of double dimensions.

input_grid:
  properties:
    - height: H
    - width: W
    - content: Original pattern of pixels.
    - background_color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  properties:
    - height: 2 * H
    - width: 2 * W
    - background_color: 0 (white)
  content:
    - top_left_quadrant:
        coordinates: (row 0 to H-1, col 0 to W-1)
        source: Copy of the input_grid content.
    - bottom_right_quadrant:
        coordinates: (row H to 2*H-1, col W to 2*W-1)
        source: Copy of the input_grid content.
    - top_right_quadrant:
        coordinates: (row 0 to H-1, col W to 2*W-1)
        source: Filled with background_color (0).
    - bottom_left_quadrant:
        coordinates: (row H to 2*H-1, col 0 to W-1)
        source: Filled with background_color (0).

actions:
  - action: Determine dimensions (H, W) of the input grid.
  - action: Create a new grid with dimensions (2*H, 2*W).
  - action: Initialize the new grid with the background color (0).
  - action: Copy the input grid content to the top-left quadrant of the new grid.
  - action: Copy the input grid content to the bottom-right quadrant of the new grid.

relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are double the input grid dimensions.
  - The output grid contains two identical copies of the input grid pattern.
  - The two copies are placed such that the top-left corner of the second copy aligns with the bottom-right corner of the first copy (diagonal placement).
