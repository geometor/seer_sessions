The examples show varying dimensions and different patterns of non-white pixels within the grid. The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output is also a rectangular grid, always larger than the input grid. Specifically, the output grid's height and width are exactly double the input grid's height and width, respectively.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a duplication and repositioning of the original input grid. The original input grid content occupies the top-left quadrant of the output grid. An identical copy of the input grid content occupies the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid. The remaining quadrants (top-right and bottom-left) are filled with the background color (white, 0).\n4.  **Color Preservation:** The colors of the pixels in the input are preserved in their respective positions within the copied sections of the output grid.\n5.  **Objectness:** The entire input grid can be considered the primary object being manipulated. It is copied as a whole unit.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
