Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid contains a prominent gray (color 5) rectangular frame. Inside this frame, there is a region of white (color 0) pixels. Outside the frame, the grid is mostly white, but importantly, there are exactly two pixels with colors other than white or gray.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the gray frame and the two external colored pixels in their original positions. The key change occurs within the boundary of the gray frame.
3.  **Transformation:** The white area inside the gray frame in the input is filled with a pattern in the output. This pattern uses the two colors found outside the frame in the input.
4.  **Pattern:** The pattern is a checkerboard style, but composed of 2x2 blocks of color. For a 4x4 inner area, the pattern looks like this:
    
```
    A A B B
    A A B B
    B B A A
    ```

    where 'A' and 'B' represent the two colors from outside the frame.
5.  **Color Assignment (A vs B):** The crucial part is determining which of the two external colors becomes 'A' (filling the top-left 2x2 block) and which becomes 'B'. This assignment depends on the relative positions of the two external colored pixels:
    *   **Horizontal Alignment:** If the two pixels are in the same row (like Example 1: Yellow at (1,1), Azure at (1,8)), the color of the *leftmost* pixel becomes 'A'.
    *   **Vertical Alignment:** If the two pixels are in the same column (like Examples 2 and 3):
        *   If they are to the *left* of the frame (like Example 3: Green at (1,1), Red at (8,1)), the color of the *topmost* pixel becomes 'A'.
        *   If they are to the *right* of the frame (like Example 2: Magenta at (1,8), Orange at (8,8)), the color of the *bottommost* pixel becomes 'A'.

      Bottom-left quadrant = Color B
      Bottom-right quadrant = Color A

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Boundaries:** Find the coordinates defining the gray (5) rectangular frame. Determine the bounding box of the white (0) area fully enclosed within this frame (the "inner area").
2.  **Locate External Colors:** Scan the grid *outside* the gray frame to find the coordinates and colors of the two non-white (0), non-gray (5) pixels. Let their colors be C1 and C2, and positions be (r1, c1) and (r2, c2).
3.  **Determine Primary Color (A):**
    *   **If the pixels are horizontally aligned (r1 == r2):** Set Color A to the color of the pixel with the smaller column index (the leftmost one). Set Color B to the other color.
    *   **If the pixels are vertically aligned (c1 == c2):**
        *   Check if their column (c1) is to the left of the inner area's columns. If yes, set Color A to the color of the pixel with the smaller row index (the topmost one). Set Color B to the other color.
        *   Check if their column (c1) is to the right of the inner area's columns. If yes, set Color A to the color of the pixel with the *larger* row index (the bottommost one). Set Color B to the other color.
4.  **Apply Pattern:** Divide the inner area into four equal quadrants based on its height and width (e.g., for a 4x4 area, the quadrants are 2x2).
    *   Fill the top-left quadrant with Color A.
    *   Fill the top-right quadrant with Color B.
    *   Fill the bottom-left quadrant with Color B.
    *   Fill the bottom-right quadrant with Color A.
5.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid by keeping the original gray frame and external colored pixels, and replacing the original inner white area with the newly filled pattern.
