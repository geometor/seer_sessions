task_context:
  description: Fill the area inside a gray frame with a 2x2 checkerboard pattern using two colors found outside the frame.
  grid_properties:
    - static_elements:
        - gray_frame: A rectangle made of gray (5) pixels.
        - external_pixels: Two pixels outside the frame with distinct, non-white, non-gray colors.
    - modified_elements:
        - inner_area: The white (0) rectangular region enclosed by the gray frame.

objects:
  - object: gray_frame
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: rectangle
      - role: boundary marker
  - object: inner_area
    properties:
      - color: white (0) in input, patterned in output
      - shape: rectangle
      - location: inside gray_frame
      - size: 4x4 (in examples)
  - object: external_pixel_1
    properties:
      - color: C1 (variable, non-white, non-gray)
      - location: (r1, c1) outside gray_frame
  - object: external_pixel_2
    properties:
      - color: C2 (variable, non-white, non-gray)
      - location: (r2, c2) outside gray_frame

relationships_and_rules:
  - rule: Determine Pattern Colors (A, B)
    based_on: relative positions of external_pixel_1 and external_pixel_2
    conditions:
      - if r1 == r2: # Same row
          - Color A = color of pixel with min(c1, c2)
          - Color B = color of pixel with max(c1, c2)
      - if c1 == c2: # Same column
          - inner_rect_coords: Get the column bounds [min_col, max_col] of the inner_area.
          - if c1 < min_col: # Left of frame
              - Color A = color of pixel with min(r1, r2)
              - Color B = color of pixel with max(r1, r2)
          - if c1 > max_col: # Right of frame
              - Color A = color of pixel with max(r1, r2) # Note: uses max row
              - Color B = color of pixel with min(r1, r2)
  - rule: Apply Pattern
    target: inner_area
    pattern: 2x2 checkerboard
    details: |
      Divide inner_area into four equal quadrants.
      Top-left quadrant = Color A
      Top-right quadrant = Color B
      Bottom-left quadrant = Color B
      Bottom-right quadrant = Color A

output_generation:
  - Preserve the gray_frame.
  - Preserve the external_pixels.
  - Replace the inner_area with the generated pattern.
