Inside this frame, there is a region of white (color 0) pixels. Outside the frame, the grid is mostly white, but importantly, there are exactly two pixels with colors other than white or gray.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the gray frame and the two external colored pixels in their original positions. The key change occurs within the boundary of the gray frame.\n3.  **Transformation:** The white area inside the gray frame in the input is filled with a pattern in the output. This pattern uses the two colors found outside the frame in the input.\n4.  **Pattern:** The pattern is a checkerboard style, but composed of 2x2 blocks of color. For a 4x4 inner area, the pattern looks like this:\n    "

This assignment depends on the relative positions of the two external colored pixels:\n    *   **Horizontal Alignment:** If the two pixels are in the same row (like Example 1: Yellow at (1,1), Azure at (1,8)), the color of the *leftmost* pixel becomes 'A'.\n    *   **Vertical Alignment:** If the two pixels are in the same column (like Examples 2 and 3):\n        *   If they are to the *left* of the frame (like Example 3: Green at (1,1), Red at (8,1)), the color of the *topmost* pixel becomes 'A'.\n        *   If they are to the *right* of the frame (like Example 2: Magenta at (1,8), Orange at (8,8)), the color of the *bottommost* pixel becomes 'A'.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
