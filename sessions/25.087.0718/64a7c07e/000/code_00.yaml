task_type: transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  value_type: color_index (0-9)
  background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_pixels
    color: 8 (azure)
    count: variable (1 or more per grid)
actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_objects
    description: Find all distinct contiguous blocks of non-background color (azure).
  - name: calculate_object_width
    input: object
    output: width (integer)
    description: Determine the width of the object's bounding box (max_col - min_col + 1).
  - name: translate_object
    input: object, distance
    output: translated_object
    description: Move the object horizontally to the right by the specified distance.
relationships:
  - type: positional_transformation
    scope: per_object
    rule: The horizontal translation distance for each object is equal to its calculated width.
output_generation:
  - process: composition
    elements: [translated_objects, background_grid]
    description: Place all translated objects onto a background grid of the original dimensions.
