            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels, primarily white (0) with some azure (8) pixels forming shapes.\n2.  **Color Palette:** Only two colors are used: white (0) as the background and azure (8) for the objects.\n3.  **Objects:** The azure pixels form distinct, contiguous shapes (objects). In some examples (train_1, train_3), there are multiple disconnected azure objects.\n4.  **Transformation:** Comparing input and output grids, the azure objects appear to have moved horizontally to the right. The background remains unchanged.\n5.  **Movement Details:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the top 'C' shape moves right, and the single pixel below it also moves right, but by a different amount. The 'C' shape spans columns 1-3 (width 3) and shifts right by 3 columns (starts at column 4 in output). The single pixel is in column 1 (width 1) and shifts right by 1 column (is at column 2 in output).\n    *   In `train_2`, the 2x2 square spans columns 0-1 (width 2) and shifts right by 2 columns (starts at column 2 in output).\n    *   In `train_3`, the top object spans columns 1-4 (width 4) and shifts right by 4 columns (starts at column 5 in output). The bottom 2x2 square spans columns 4-5 (width 2) and shifts right by 2 columns (starts at column 6 in output).\n6.  **Pattern:** The amount each object shifts horizontally to the right seems directly related to the horizontal extent (width) of that specific object. Each object is shifted right by a number of columns equal to its own width.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
