Transformation Rule:
1. Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-background pixels (azure, 8) in the input grid.
2. For each identified object:
   a. Determine the width of the object's bounding box (max_col - min_col + 1).
   b. Calculate the horizontal shift amount, which is equal to the object's width.
   c. Translate the object horizontally to the right by the calculated shift amount.
3. Construct the output grid by placing all translated objects onto a background grid of the original dimensions, filled with the background color (white, 0).
