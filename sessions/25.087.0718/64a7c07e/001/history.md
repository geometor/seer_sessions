Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels, primarily white (0) with some azure (8) pixels forming shapes.
2.  **Color Palette:** Only two colors are used: white (0) as the background and azure (8) for the objects.
3.  **Objects:** The azure pixels form distinct, contiguous shapes (objects). In some examples (train_1, train_3), there are multiple disconnected azure objects.
4.  **Transformation:** Comparing input and output grids, the azure objects appear to have moved horizontally to the right. The background remains unchanged.
5.  **Movement Details:**
    *   In `train_1`, the top 'C' shape moves right, and the single pixel below it also moves right, but by a different amount. The 'C' shape spans columns 1-3 (width 3) and shifts right by 3 columns (starts at column 4 in output). The single pixel is in column 1 (width 1) and shifts right by 1 column (is at column 2 in output).
    *   In `train_2`, the 2x2 square spans columns 0-1 (width 2) and shifts right by 2 columns (starts at column 2 in output).
    *   In `train_3`, the top object spans columns 1-4 (width 4) and shifts right by 4 columns (starts at column 5 in output). The bottom 2x2 square spans columns 4-5 (width 2) and shifts right by 2 columns (starts at column 6 in output).
6.  **Pattern:** The amount each object shifts horizontally to the right seems directly related to the horizontal extent (width) of that specific object. Each object is shifted right by a number of columns equal to its own width.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-background pixels (azure, 8) in the input grid.
3.  For each identified object:
    a.  Determine the minimum and maximum column indices occupied by the object's pixels.
    b.  Calculate the width of the object as `max_column - min_column + 1`.
    c.  Determine the horizontal shift amount, which is equal to the object's calculated width.
    d.  For every pixel belonging to this object at `(row, col)` in the input grid, copy its color (azure, 8) to the position `(row, col + shift_amount)` in the output grid.
4.  Return the final output grid.
