Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 2D grids of varying sizes (12x12, 12x12, 10x10). The background is consistently white (0).
2.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains several small, distinct objects composed of non-white pixels (Azure, Red, Green, Blue). These objects appear in pairs of rows and follow a diagonal pattern in the input grids (top-left to bottom-right in examples 1 and 3, bottom-left to top-right in example 2).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a spatial rearrangement of the entire grid content. Comparing the input and output grids row by row reveals a consistent pattern: the top row of the input becomes the bottom row of the output, the second row from the top becomes the second row from the bottom, and so on. The colors and relative positions within the objects themselves remain unchanged.
4.  **Consistency:** This transformation pattern (vertical flip) holds true across all three provided training examples, regardless of the specific colors, shapes, or initial arrangement of the objects.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Cell_Values: Integers 0-9 (representing colors)
  Background_Color: white (0)
Transformation:
  Type: Geometric
  Operation: Reflection
  Axis: Horizontal (across the middle row)
  Effect: Reverses the order of rows
Mapping:
  Input_Pixel_Position: (row, column)
  Output_Pixel_Position: (grid_height - 1 - row, column)
Object_Integrity:
  Preserved: Yes (objects are moved as whole units, their internal structure and colors do not change)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the height of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  For each row in the input grid, starting from the top row (row index 0) down to the bottom row (row index `height - 1`):
    a.  Copy the content of the input grid's row at index `r`.
    b.  Place this copied row into the output grid at row index `height - 1 - r`.
4.  Return the newly created output grid.

Essentially, the program describes the process of **flipping the input grid vertically**.
