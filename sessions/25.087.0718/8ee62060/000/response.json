The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains several small, distinct objects composed of non-white pixels (Azure, Red, Green, Blue). These objects appear in pairs of rows and follow a diagonal pattern in the input grids (top-left to bottom-right in examples 1 and 3, bottom-left to top-right in example 2).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a spatial rearrangement of the entire grid content. Comparing the input and output grids row by row reveals a consistent pattern: the top row of the input becomes the bottom row of the output, the second row from the top becomes the second row from the bottom, and so on. The colors and relative positions within the objects themselves remain unchanged.\n4.  **Consistency:** This transformation pattern (vertical flip) holds true across all three provided training examples, regardless of the specific colors, shapes, or initial arrangement of the objects.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
