```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
  """
  Reverses the vertical order of pairs of rows in the input grid.

  Assumes the input grid has an even number of rows (H).
  The transformation treats consecutive rows (2*p, 2*p+1) as a pair, 
  where 'p' is the pair index starting from 0.
  It reverses the order of these pairs vertically.
  For example, the top pair (Row 0, Row 1) moves to the position 
  of the bottom pair (Row H-2, Row H-1), and the bottom pair 
  moves to the top position (Row 0, Row 1).
