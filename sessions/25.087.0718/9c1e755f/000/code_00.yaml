elements:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels with colors 0-9.
  - type: background
    color: 0 (white)
    role: Empty space.
  - type: structure
    color: 5 (gray)
    form: Straight lines (horizontal or vertical) of contiguous gray pixels.
    role: Anchor or guide for the transformation.
  - type: pattern
    color: Any color except 0 (white) and 5 (gray).
    form: One or more rows or columns of colored pixels located immediately adjacent to one end/side of a gray line structure.
    role: Source template for filling.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Patterns are located directly next to (sharing an edge, not just diagonally) a gray line structure.
  - type: alignment
    description: The pattern is aligned with one end/side of the gray line.

actions:
  - name: identify_lines
    input: input grid
    output: list of gray line structures (coordinates, orientation).
  - name: identify_patterns
    input: input grid, gray line structure
    output: source pattern (pixels, dimensions) adjacent to one end/side of the line.
  - name: determine_fill_area
    input: gray line structure, source pattern location
    output: coordinates of the area to be filled adjacent to the main body of the gray line.
  - name: replicate_pattern
    input: source pattern, fill area, gray line orientation
    output: modified grid segment where the pattern is copied or tiled cyclically along the axis parallel to the gray line.
  - name: combine
    input: original input grid, all replicated pattern segments
    output: final output grid.

transformation_logic:
  - step: Find all maximal contiguous straight gray lines (horizontal or vertical).
  - step: For each gray line found:
      - Identify if there is a pattern (non-white, non-gray pixels) adjacent to one of its ends/sides.
      - If a pattern is found:
          - Record the pattern's pixels and dimensions.
          - Determine the target area adjacent to the gray line's main body, on the same side as the pattern.
          - Fill the target area by repeatedly copying (or cyclically tiling, if the pattern has multiple rows/columns) the source pattern along the length/width of the gray line.
  - step: The output grid is the input grid potentially modified by the filled patterns.
