            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Core Element:** The central feature in each input seems to be one or more straight lines (vertical or horizontal) made of gray pixels (color 5).\n2.  **Adjacent Patterns:** Directly next to one end or side of these gray lines, there are patterns composed of other colors (non-gray, non-white). These patterns can be single rows/columns or multiple rows/columns.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves replicating the adjacent color pattern along the length of the associated gray line.\n4.  **Orientation:** If the gray line is vertical, the adjacent pattern is typically horizontal (one or more rows) and is copied *vertically* into the columns next to the gray line. If the gray line is horizontal, the adjacent pattern is typically vertical (one or more columns) and is copied *horizontally* into the rows next to the gray line.\n5.  **Tiling:** If the adjacent pattern consists of multiple rows/columns (like in train\\_2 and train\\_4), these rows/columns are tiled cyclically along the gray line's length.\n6.  **Source Location:** The pattern to be copied is found adjacent to *one* specific end/side of the gray line. This seems to be the end/side where non-white pixels exist immediately next to the gray line segment.\n7.  **Extent:** The copying/tiling fills the area directly adjacent to the gray line for its entire length/width.\n8.  **Multiple Lines:** If multiple gray lines exist (train\\_4), each acts independently with its adjacent pattern.\n9.  **Background:** White pixels (0) act as the background and are generally ignored unless they are part of the pattern being copied (which doesn't seem to be the case here). The gray lines themselves remain unchanged in the output.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Determine its orientation (horizontal or vertical) and its start and end coordinates.\n    b.  Check the region immediately adjacent to one end/side of the line for a pattern of non-white, non-gray pixels.

If a pattern is found adjacent to *one* specific end/side:\n        i.   Capture the pattern: Identify the block of non-white pixels constituting the pattern adjacent to that end/side. Note its dimensions (height and width) and pixel values.\n        ii.  Determine the fill direction: This will be along the axis of the gray line (vertical for a vertical line, horizontal for a horizontal line).\n        iii. Determine the fill region: This is the set of coordinates directly adjacent to the main body of the gray line (excluding the end where the pattern was found), on the same side as the pattern. The region spans the length/width of the gray line.\n        iv.  Propagate the pattern: Fill the determined region by repeatedly placing copies of the source pattern. If the source pattern has multiple rows (for vertical propagation) or columns (for horizontal propagation), tile them cyclically. Modify the output grid accordingly.\n4.  Return the final modified output grid."
