Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9.
2.  **Key Object:** In all examples, there is a prominent shape or frame made of gray pixels (color 5). This gray shape appears unchanged between input and output.
3.  **Internal Area:** The gray shape encloses an inner area containing pixels of various colors.
4.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes between input and output occur *exclusively* within the area enclosed by the gray shape. Pixels outside the gray shape and the gray shape itself remain identical.
5.  **Color Swapping:** Within the enclosed area, specific pairs of colors appear to swap positions.
    *   In `train_1`, maroon (9) and yellow (4) pixels swap places inside the gray frame. White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
    *   In `train_2`, azure (8) and magenta (6) pixels swap places inside the gray frame. White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
    *   In `train_3`, green (3) and red (2) pixels swap places inside the gray frame. White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
6.  **Identifying Swap Colors:** The colors being swapped are the two non-gray (5), non-white (0) colors present within the enclosed region.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: Grid
    properties: [2D, integer values 0-9, represents colors]
  - type: Object
    name: GrayFrame
    color: 5 (gray)
    properties: [contiguous shape, encloses an area, static between input and output]
  - type: Region
    name: EnclosedArea
    definition: Pixels not part of GrayFrame and not reachable from grid borders without crossing GrayFrame.
    properties: [contains various colors]
  - type: Object
    name: InsidePixels
    location: Within EnclosedArea
    properties: [can be any color, subject to transformation]
  - type: ColorPair
    name: SwapColors
    definition: The two unique colors within EnclosedArea that are not gray (5) and not white (0).
    properties: [dynamically determined per example]
actions:
  - name: IdentifyBoundary
    input: Input Grid
    output: Coordinates of GrayFrame pixels
  - name: IdentifyEnclosedArea
    input: Input Grid, GrayFrame coordinates
    output: Coordinates of InsidePixels
    method: Flood fill from borders, identify unreached non-gray pixels.
  - name: IdentifySwapColors
    input: Colors of InsidePixels
    output: The two specific non-gray, non-white colors (ColorA, ColorB) present.
  - name: SwapPixels
    input: Input Grid, InsidePixels coordinates, ColorA, ColorB
    output: Output Grid
    rule: Iterate through InsidePixels. If pixel color is ColorA, change to ColorB in output. If pixel color is ColorB, change to ColorA in output. All other pixels (gray frame, outside pixels, white pixels inside) retain their original color.
relationships:
  - GrayFrame encloses InsidePixels.
  - Transformation applies only to InsidePixels.
  - The specific colors to be swapped (SwapColors) are determined by the colors present among the InsidePixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  **Identify Frame:** Locate all gray (5) pixels which form a boundary or frame.
3.  **Find Interior:** Determine the region strictly inside the gray frame. This can be done by identifying all non-gray pixels that are not connected to the grid's outer border without crossing the gray frame (e.g., using a flood fill starting from the borders). Mark these pixels as "interior".
4.  **Identify Swap Colors:** Examine the colors of all "interior" pixels. Find the two distinct colors present in this interior region, excluding gray (5) and white (0). Let these colors be Color A and Color B.
5.  **Perform Swap:** Iterate through each pixel identified as "interior":
    *   If the pixel's color in the input grid is Color A, change its color in the output grid to Color B.
    *   If the pixel's color in the input grid is Color B, change its color in the output grid to Color A.
    *   If the pixel's color is white (0) or any other color not part of the identified swap pair, leave its color unchanged in the output grid.
6.  **Finalize:** The output grid, now modified with the swapped colors in the interior region, is the result. Pixels outside the interior region (including the gray frame itself) remain unchanged from the input grid.
