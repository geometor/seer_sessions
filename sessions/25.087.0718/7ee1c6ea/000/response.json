This gray shape appears unchanged between input and output.\n3.  **Internal Area:** The gray shape encloses an inner area containing pixels of various colors.\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes between input and output occur *exclusively* within the area enclosed by the gray shape. Pixels outside the gray shape and the gray shape itself remain identical.\n5.  **Color Swapping:** Within the enclosed area, specific pairs of colors appear to swap positions.\n    *   In `train_1`, maroon (9) and yellow (4) pixels swap places inside the gray frame. White (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n    *   In `train_2`, azure (8) and magenta (6) pixels swap places inside the gray frame. White (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n    *   In `train_3`, green (3) and red (2) pixels swap places inside the gray frame. White (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n6.  **Identifying Swap Colors:** The colors being swapped are the two non-gray (5), non-white (0) colors present within the enclosed region.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

This can be done by identifying all non-gray pixels that are not connected to the grid's outer border without crossing the gray frame (e.g., using a flood fill starting from the borders). Mark these pixels as \"interior\".\n4.  **Identify Swap Colors:** Examine the colors of all \"interior\" pixels. Find the two distinct colors present in this interior region, excluding gray (5) and white (0). Let these colors be Color A and Color B.\n5.  **Perform Swap:** Iterate through each pixel identified as \"interior\":\n    *   If the pixel's color in the input grid is Color A, change its color in the output grid to Color B.\n    *   If the pixel's color in the input grid is Color B, change its color in the output grid to Color A.\n    *   If the pixel's color is white (0) or any other color not part of the identified swap pair, leave its color unchanged in the output grid.\n6.  **Finalize:** The output grid, now modified with the swapped colors in the interior region, is the result. Pixels outside the interior region (including the gray frame itself) remain unchanged from the input grid."
