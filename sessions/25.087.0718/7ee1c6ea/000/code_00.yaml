task_elements:
  - type: Grid
    properties: [2D, integer values 0-9, represents colors]
  - type: Object
    name: GrayFrame
    color: 5 (gray)
    properties: [contiguous shape, encloses an area, static between input and output]
  - type: Region
    name: EnclosedArea
    definition: Pixels not part of GrayFrame and not reachable from grid borders without crossing GrayFrame.
    properties: [contains various colors]
  - type: Object
    name: InsidePixels
    location: Within EnclosedArea
    properties: [can be any color, subject to transformation]
  - type: ColorPair
    name: SwapColors
    definition: The two unique colors within EnclosedArea that are not gray (5) and not white (0).
    properties: [dynamically determined per example]
actions:
  - name: IdentifyBoundary
    input: Input Grid
    output: Coordinates of GrayFrame pixels
  - name: IdentifyEnclosedArea
    input: Input Grid, GrayFrame coordinates
    output: Coordinates of InsidePixels
    method: Flood fill from borders, identify unreached non-gray pixels.
  - name: IdentifySwapColors
    input: Colors of InsidePixels
    output: The two specific non-gray, non-white colors (ColorA, ColorB) present.
  - name: SwapPixels
    input: Input Grid, InsidePixels coordinates, ColorA, ColorB
    output: Output Grid
    rule: Iterate through InsidePixels. If pixel color is ColorA, change to ColorB in output. If pixel color is ColorB, change to ColorA in output. All other pixels (gray frame, outside pixels, white pixels inside) retain their original color.
relationships:
  - GrayFrame encloses InsidePixels.
  - Transformation applies only to InsidePixels.
  - The specific colors to be swapped (SwapColors) are determined by the colors present among the InsidePixels.
