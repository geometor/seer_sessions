task_description: "Extract distinct non-background objects, potentially filter or modify them based on adjacency or other properties, rearrange them according to a 90-degree clockwise rotation of their original relative layout, and pack them tightly into the output grid."

definitions:
  background_color: "The color of the pixel at the top-left corner (0,0) of the input grid. Consistent across examples (Yellow, Azure, White)."
  object: "A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-background color."

observations:
  - input_grid: Contains a background color and one or more distinct objects of different colors. Objects may touch or overlap in their bounding boxes.
  - output_grid: Contains pixels corresponding to the colors of the input objects, but often fewer pixels of each color compared to the input. The output is densely packed, usually smaller than the input's non-background bounding box.
  - object_filtering: A filtering or modification process occurs, as the total number of pixels for most object colors decreases from input to output. Some simpler objects (often smaller and not adjacent to others) seem to retain their exact shape and pixel count (e.g., Green in Ex1, Gray in Ex2, Azure in Ex3). The filtering rule is unclear but likely related to adjacency (to background or other objects).
  - object_preservation: The core shapes/colors of input objects are recognizable in the output, although sometimes truncated or slightly modified.
  - transformation_steps:
      1. Identify background and non-background objects in the input.
      2. Filter/select/modify the objects or their pixels based on an unknown rule (crucial step).
      3. Determine the relative spatial layout of the original objects (e.g., using centroids or bounding box corners).
      4. Calculate a new layout by rotating the original relative layout 90 degrees clockwise.
      5. Assemble the filtered/selected objects/pixels into the output grid according to the rotated layout, packing them adjacently.
  - packing: Objects in the output are placed adjacently, minimizing empty space.

uncertainties:
  - The precise rule for filtering/selecting/modifying objects or pixels leading to the observed changes in pixel counts.
  - The exact method for packing based on the rotated relative layout (e.g., alignment reference points, handling potential overlaps during packing).
