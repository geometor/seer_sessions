Observations:
  - Task: Recolor specific objects based on proximity to other objects.
  - InputGrid:
      - Contains a white background (0).
      - Contains one or more "target" objects composed of blue pixels (1).
      - Contains one or more "source" pixels/objects with colors other than white(0) or blue(1).
  - OutputGrid:
      - Identical structure to the input grid.
      - Source pixels/objects are unchanged.
      - White background pixels are unchanged.
      - Target (originally blue) objects are recolored.
Transformation:
  - Identify:
      - All contiguous blue (1) objects (Targets).
      - All non-white(0), non-blue(1) pixels (Sources). Store their locations and colors.
  - Rule:
      - For each Target object:
          - Calculate the minimum Manhattan distance from any pixel within the Target object to any Source pixel.
          - Find all Source pixels that achieve this minimum distance.
          - Determine the color(s) of these closest Source pixels.
          - If there's only one unique closest color, recolor the entire Target object with that color.
          - If there are multiple unique closest colors (tie in distance), select the color with the minimum numerical index among them. Recolor the entire Target object with this selected color.
  - Result: Update the grid by changing the color of all pixels belonging to each Target object according to the determined color. Pixels not part of a Target object remain unchanged.
Properties:
  - Objects: Defined by contiguous pixels of the same color.
  - Relevant Colors: Blue (1) as Target, others (2-9) as Source, White (0) as background.
  - Distance: Manhattan distance is used to determine proximity.
  - Tie-breaking: Based on the minimum color index among equidistant Source pixels.
