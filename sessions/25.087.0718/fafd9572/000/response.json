            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception of Elements and Transformation**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Composition**: The input grids contain various shapes formed by contiguous pixels of the same color, primarily blue (1), set against a white (0) background. There are also other non-white, non-blue colored pixels present, sometimes forming small shapes (e.g., red (2), green (3), yellow (4)).\n2.  **Output Grid Composition**: The output grids largely resemble the input grids, but the blue (1) shapes from the input have changed color. The other non-white, non-blue pixels/shapes remain in their original positions with their original colors.\n3.  **Color Change Logic**: The key transformation involves changing the color of the blue (1) objects. Observing the relationship between the initial blue objects and the other colored pixels (red, green, yellow) suggests a proximity-based rule.\n4.  **Proximity Rule**: In both examples, each blue object seems to adopt the color of the *nearest* non-white, non-blue pixel.\n    *   In `train_1`, the blue shapes adopt the color (red or green) of the nearest pixel from the small red/green pattern in the lower right.\n    *   In `train_2`, the blue shapes adopt the color (red, yellow, or green) of the nearest pixel from the small red/yellow or green shapes.\n5.  **Distance Metric**: The \"nearest\" appears to be based on Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences in row and column coordinates).\n6.  **Tie-breaking**: In `train_1`, the bottom-right blue 'C' shape has pixels that are equidistant (Manhattan distance 1) from both a red (2) pixel and a green (3) pixel. The shape becomes red (2) in the output. This suggests a tie-breaking rule: if a blue object is equally close to multiple different color source pixels, it takes the color with the lower numerical index (2 < 3, so red is chosen over green).\n7.  **Object Integrity**: The shapes of the blue objects are preserved; only their color changes. Other objects/pixels remain entirely unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
