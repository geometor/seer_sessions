Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements and Transformation**

1.  **Input Grid Composition**: The input grids contain various shapes formed by contiguous pixels of the same color, primarily blue (1), set against a white (0) background. There are also other non-white, non-blue colored pixels present, sometimes forming small shapes (e.g., red (2), green (3), yellow (4)).
2.  **Output Grid Composition**: The output grids largely resemble the input grids, but the blue (1) shapes from the input have changed color. The other non-white, non-blue pixels/shapes remain in their original positions with their original colors.
3.  **Color Change Logic**: The key transformation involves changing the color of the blue (1) objects. Observing the relationship between the initial blue objects and the other colored pixels (red, green, yellow) suggests a proximity-based rule.
4.  **Proximity Rule**: In both examples, each blue object seems to adopt the color of the *nearest* non-white, non-blue pixel.
    *   In `train_1`, the blue shapes adopt the color (red or green) of the nearest pixel from the small red/green pattern in the lower right.
    *   In `train_2`, the blue shapes adopt the color (red, yellow, or green) of the nearest pixel from the small red/yellow or green shapes.
5.  **Distance Metric**: The "nearest" appears to be based on Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences in row and column coordinates).
6.  **Tie-breaking**: In `train_1`, the bottom-right blue 'C' shape has pixels that are equidistant (Manhattan distance 1) from both a red (2) pixel and a green (3) pixel. The shape becomes red (2) in the output. This suggests a tie-breaking rule: if a blue object is equally close to multiple different color source pixels, it takes the color with the lower numerical index (2 < 3, so red is chosen over green).
7.  **Object Integrity**: The shapes of the blue objects are preserved; only their color changes. Other objects/pixels remain entirely unchanged.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Observations:
  - Task: Recolor specific objects based on proximity to other objects.
  - InputGrid:
      - Contains a white background (0).
      - Contains one or more "target" objects composed of blue pixels (1).
      - Contains one or more "source" pixels/objects with colors other than white(0) or blue(1).
  - OutputGrid:
      - Identical structure to the input grid.
      - Source pixels/objects are unchanged.
      - White background pixels are unchanged.
      - Target (originally blue) objects are recolored.
Transformation:
  - Identify:
      - All contiguous blue (1) objects (Targets).
      - All non-white(0), non-blue(1) pixels (Sources). Store their locations and colors.
  - Rule:
      - For each Target object:
          - Calculate the minimum Manhattan distance from any pixel within the Target object to any Source pixel.
          - Find all Source pixels that achieve this minimum distance.
          - Determine the color(s) of these closest Source pixels.
          - If there's only one unique closest color, recolor the entire Target object with that color.
          - If there are multiple unique closest colors (tie in distance), select the color with the minimum numerical index among them. Recolor the entire Target object with this selected color.
  - Result: Update the grid by changing the color of all pixels belonging to each Target object according to the determined color. Pixels not part of a Target object remain unchanged.
Properties:
  - Objects: Defined by contiguous pixels of the same color.
  - Relevant Colors: Blue (1) as Target, others (2-9) as Source, White (0) as background.
  - Distance: Manhattan distance is used to determine proximity.
  - Tie-breaking: Based on the minimum color index among equidistant Source pixels.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are *not* white (0) and *not* blue (1). Record their coordinates and colors. These are the "color source pixels".
3.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. These are the "blue objects".
4.  For each identified blue object:
    a.  Initialize a variable `min_distance_found` to a very large number (infinity).
    b.  Initialize a variable `target_color` to indicate no color has been chosen yet (e.g., -1 or null).
    c.  Iterate through every pixel `(r_blue, c_blue)` belonging to the current blue object.
    d.  For each `(r_blue, c_blue)`, iterate through every identified color source pixel `(r_src, c_src)` with color `color_src`.
        i.  Calculate the Manhattan distance: `distance = abs(r_blue - r_src) + abs(c_blue - c_src)`.
        ii. If `distance < min_distance_found`:
            - Update `min_distance_found = distance`.
            - Update `target_color = color_src`.
        iii. Else if `distance == min_distance_found`:
            - If `color_src < target_color`, update `target_color = color_src` (apply tie-breaking rule based on lower color index).
    e.  After checking all pixels of the blue object against all color source pixels, if a `target_color` was determined (i.e., `min_distance_found` is not infinity):
        i.  Iterate through all pixel coordinates `(r_blue, c_blue)` originally belonging to this blue object in the input grid.
        ii. Set the pixel at `(r_blue, c_blue)` in the *output* grid to the determined `target_color`.
5.  Return the final output grid.
