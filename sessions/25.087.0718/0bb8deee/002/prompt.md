"""
The transformation identifies a horizontal and a vertical line of the same 
non-white color that divide the input grid into four quadrants. It then extracts 
the content (non-white pixels) within the minimal bounding box from each 
quadrant. Finally, it assembles these extracted contents into a new, smaller 
grid (specifically 6x6 in the examples), placing each quadrant's content into 
a corresponding 3x3 subgrid (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), 
preserving their relative positions. The dividing lines are discarded.
