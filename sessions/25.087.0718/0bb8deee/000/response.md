*   **Perception:** The input grid is consistently divided into four quadrants by a single horizontal line and a single vertical line. These lines are composed of a single, non-white color, and they intersect. Each quadrant defined by these lines contains a distinct object (a contiguous shape of non-white pixels) or is empty (all white). The output grid is smaller than the input and appears to be constructed by extracting the content (the objects) from each of the four input quadrants and arranging them into a 2x2 grid structure, preserving their relative positions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). The dividing lines themselves are removed in the output.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Observations:
      - Input and output are grids of pixels with values 0-9 (colors).
      - Input grids contain dividing lines: one horizontal, one vertical.
      - Dividing lines share the same non-white color and intersect.
      - Dividing lines partition the input grid into four quadrants.
      - Each quadrant contains the pixels within its boundaries, excluding the dividing lines.
    Objects:
      - Dividing Lines: A horizontal row and a vertical column of the same non-white color.
      - Quadrant Content: The set of non-white pixels within a quadrant. Often forms a distinct shape.
    Relationships:
      - The dividing lines determine the boundaries of the four quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), Bottom-Right (BR).
      - The output grid is composed of the contents of the four input quadrants.
    Transformations:
      - Identification: Locate the horizontal and vertical dividing lines and their color.
      - Partitioning: Define the four quadrants based on the line positions.
      - Extraction: For each quadrant, isolate the non-white content within its minimal bounding box.
      - Assembly: Arrange the extracted bounding boxes into a new grid, maintaining the TL, TR, BL, BR relative positions. The size of each section in the output grid appears to be uniform (3x3 in examples), potentially determined by the maximum bounding box size across quadrants.
      - Removal: The dividing lines and any excess white space around the quadrant content are removed.
    Properties:
      - Output Size: In the examples, the output grid is consistently 6x6, formed by four 3x3 subgrids.
      - Content Preservation: The shapes/pixels within each quadrant's bounding box are preserved in the corresponding output subgrid.
      - Background: The background color (white, 0) fills any empty space within the output subgrids if the extracted content is smaller than the subgrid size (though not observed in examples) or if a quadrant was empty.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input grid to identify the unique horizontal row (`div_row`) and unique vertical column (`div_col`) that consist entirely of the same non-white color (`divider_color`).
    2.  Define the four quadrants based on the dividing lines:
        *   Top-Left (TL): The subgrid from row 0 to `div_row - 1` and column 0 to `div_col - 1`.
        *   Top-Right (TR): The subgrid from row 0 to `div_row - 1` and column `div_col + 1` to the last column.
        *   Bottom-Left (BL): The subgrid from row `div_row + 1` to the last row and column 0 to `div_col - 1`.
        *   Bottom-Right (BR): The subgrid from row `div_row + 1` to the last row and column `div_col + 1` to the last column.
    3.  For each quadrant (TL, TR, BL, BR):
        a.  Find all non-white pixels within that quadrant.
        b.  If non-white pixels exist, determine the minimum bounding box that encloses all of them within the quadrant.
        c.  Extract the grid content within this bounding box. Let this be `content_TL`, `content_TR`, `content_BL`, `content_BR`.
        d.  If a quadrant contains no non-white pixels, its corresponding content is considered empty or a default white block.
    4.  Determine the dimensions (height `h`, width `w`) for the subgrids in the output. Based on the examples, this appears to be consistently 3x3. (Alternatively, calculate the maximum height and maximum width among the bounding boxes found in step 3c).
    5.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `2h x 2w` (e.g., 6x6 if `h=3`, `w=3`), initialized with the background color (white, 0).
    6.  Place the extracted content into the output grid:
        *   Place `content_TL` into the top-left `h x w` section of the output grid (rows `0` to `h-1`, columns `0` to `w-1`).
        *   Place `content_TR` into the top-right `h x w` section (rows `0` to `h-1`, columns `w` to `2w-1`).
        *   Place `content_BL` into the bottom-left `h x w` section (rows `h` to `2h-1`, columns `0` to `w-1`).
        *   Place `content_BR` into the bottom-right `h x w` section (rows `h` to `2h-1`, columns `w` to `2w-1`).
        *   If any extracted content is smaller than `h x w`, place it at the top-left corner of its respective `h x w` section, padding the rest with the background color.
