**Analysis of `find_dividing_lines` Debug Output:**

The code is finding *multiple* candidate lines and *multiple* valid intersections in each example, not just one. The assumption that there would be a *unique* pair of lines with the same color intersecting at a pixel of that color was wrong.

*   **Example 1:** Found 9 intersections of color Red (2). Visual inspection confirms row 3 and column 7 are solid Red lines. However, the code also identifies other rows/cols as candidates (e.g., row 4 `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]`, col 0 `[0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`). The rule "all non-background pixels have the same color" is met even if there's only *one* non-background pixel. This is likely the source of the error. The dividing lines seem to be *solid* lines of a single color, spanning the entire width or height.

*   **Example 2:** Found 11 intersections of color Blue (1). Visual inspection suggests row 9 and column 4 are the solid Blue lines. The code finds many other partial lines.

*   **Example 3:** Found 9 intersections of color Green (3). Visual inspection suggests row 4 and column 6 are the solid Green lines. The code finds many other partial lines.

**Revised Strategy:**

The definition of a dividing line needs to be stricter. It should be a line (row or column) composed *entirely* of a single non-white color.

Let's refine the `find_dividing_lines` function based on this stricter definition and test it again.

**Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code failed because the definition used to identify dividing lines was too permissive. It identified lines where all *non-white* pixels were the same color, leading to multiple candidates and intersections. The revised analysis, based on visual inspection and testing the stricter definition (a line must be *entirely* composed of a single non-white color), successfully identified the unique dividing row, column, and color for each example.

The strategy is to update the `find_dividing_lines` function in the original code with this stricter definition. The rest of the logic (quadrant definition, content extraction, and placement) appears conceptually correct based on the expected outputs and should work once the correct dividing lines are found.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Solid Dividing Lines:**
    a.  Scan the input grid row by row to find any **solid horizontal line**. A solid horizontal line at row `R` consists *entirely* of a single non-white color `C_h` across the full width of the grid.
    b.  Scan the input grid column by column to find any **solid vertical line**. A solid vertical line at column `Col` consists *entirely* of a single non-white color `C_v` across the full height of the grid.
    c.  Find the *unique* pair of a solid horizontal line (row `R`, color `C_h`) and a solid vertical line (column `Col`, color `C_v`) such that their colors match (`C_h == C_v`). Let this common color be the `dividing_color`. If no such unique pair exists, the transformation cannot proceed as defined (return a 6x6 all-white grid).
2.  **Define Quadrants:** Use the dividing line indices (`R`, `Col`) to define four rectangular regions (quadrants) *excluding* the dividing lines themselves:
    *   Top-Left (TL): `grid[0 : R, 0 : Col]`
    *   Top-Right (TR): `grid[0 : R, Col + 1 : width]`
    *   Bottom-Left (BL): `grid[R + 1 : height, 0 : Col]`
    *   Bottom-Right (BR): `grid[R + 1 : height, Col + 1 : width]`
3.  **Extract Content:** For each of the four quadrants:
    a.  Isolate the subgrid corresponding to the quadrant's boundaries.
    b.  Within this subgrid, identify the locations of all pixels whose color is *neither* the background color (0) *nor* the `dividing_color`.
    c.  If no such pixels are found, this quadrant's content is considered empty.
    d.  If such pixels exist, determine the minimal bounding box (smallest rectangle) that encloses *all* of them, relative to the quadrant's top-left corner.
    e.  Extract the subgrid defined by this bounding box. This is the quadrant's `content_grid`.
4.  **Assemble Output:** Create a new 6x6 grid, initialized entirely with the background color (0).
5.  **Place Content:** For each quadrant (TL, TR, BL, BR) and its corresponding extracted `content_grid` (which might be empty):
    a.  Determine the target 3x3 area in the output grid:
        *   TL -> rows 0-2, cols 0-2
        *   TR -> rows 0-2, cols 3-5
        *   BL -> rows 3-5, cols 0-2
        *   BR -> rows 3-5, cols 3-5
    b.  If the `content_grid` is not empty:
        i.  Determine the dimensions (`h`, `w`) of the `content_grid`.
        ii. Calculate the dimensions to copy: `copy_h = min(h, 3)`, `copy_w = min(w, 3)`.
        iii. Copy the top-left `copy_h` x `copy_w` portion of the `content_grid` into the target 3x3 area, starting at the top-left corner (e.g., `output[0:copy_h, 0:copy_w]` for TL). The remaining parts of the 3x3 area stay background color (0).
    c.  If the `content_grid` is empty, the target 3x3 area remains filled with the background color.
6.  **Return:** The final 6x6 assembled grid.
