            "text": "**Analysis of `find_dividing_lines` Debug Output:**\n\nThe code is finding *multiple* candidate lines and *multiple* valid intersections in each example, not just one. The assumption that there would be a *unique* pair of lines with the same color intersecting at a pixel of that color was wrong.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Found 9 intersections of color Red (2). Visual inspection confirms row 3 and column 7 are solid Red lines. However, the code also identifies other rows/cols as candidates (e.g., row 4 `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]`, col 0 `[0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`). The rule \"all non-background pixels have the same color\" is met even if there's only *one* non-background pixel. This is likely the source of the error. The dividing lines seem to be *solid* lines of a single color, spanning the entire width or height.\n\n*   **Example 2:** Found 11 intersections of color Blue (1). Visual inspection suggests row 9 and column 4 are the solid Blue lines. The code finds many other partial lines.\n\n*   **Example 3:** Found 9 intersections of color Green (3). Visual inspection suggests row 4 and column 6 are the solid Green lines. The code finds many other partial lines.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\nThe definition of a dividing line needs to be stricter. It should be a line (row or column) composed *entirely* of a single non-white color.\n\nLet's refine the `find_dividing_lines` function based on this stricter definition and test it again.\n\n"

It identified lines where all *non-white* pixels were the same color, leading to multiple candidates and intersections. The revised analysis, based on visual inspection and testing the stricter definition (a line must be *entirely* composed of a single non-white color), successfully identified the unique dividing row, column, and color for each example.\n\nThe strategy is to update the `find_dividing_lines` function in the original code with this stricter definition.

A solid horizontal line at row `R` consists *entirely* of a single non-white color `C_h` across the full width of the grid.\n    b.  Scan the input grid column by column to find any **solid vertical line**. A solid vertical line at column `Col` consists *entirely* of a single non-white color `C_v` across the full height of the grid.\n    c.  Find the *unique* pair of a solid horizontal line (row `R`, color `C_h`) and a solid vertical line (column `Col`, color `C_v`) such that their colors match (`C_h == C_v`). Let this common color be the `dividing_color`. If no such unique pair exists, the transformation cannot proceed as defined (return a 6x6 all-white grid).\n2.  **Define Quadrants:** Use the dividing line indices (`R`, `Col`) to define four rectangular regions (quadrants) *excluding* the dividing lines themselves:\n    *   Top-Left (TL): `grid[0 : R, 0 : Col]`\n    *   Top-Right (TR): `grid[0 : R, Col + 1 : width]`\n    *   Bottom-Left (BL): `grid[R + 1 : height, 0 : Col]`\n    *   Bottom-Right (BR): `grid[R + 1 : height, Col + 1 : width]`\n3.  **Extract Content:** For each of the four quadrants:\n    a.  Isolate the subgrid corresponding to the quadrant's boundaries.\n    b.  Within this subgrid, identify the locations of all pixels whose color is *neither* the background color (0) *nor* the `dividing_color`.\n    c.  If no such pixels are found, this quadrant's content is considered empty.\n    d.  If such pixels exist, determine the minimal bounding box (smallest rectangle) that encloses *all* of them, relative to the quadrant's top-left corner.\n    e.  Extract the subgrid defined by this bounding box. This is the quadrant's `content_grid`.\n4.  **Assemble Output:** Create a new 6x6 grid, initialized entirely with the background color (0).\n5.  **Place Content:** For each quadrant (TL, TR, BL, BR) and its corresponding extracted `content_grid` (which might be empty):\n    a.  Determine the target 3x3 area in the output grid:\n        *   TL -> rows 0-2, cols 0-2\n        *   TR -> rows 0-2, cols 3-5\n        *   BL -> rows 3-5, cols 0-2\n        *   BR -> rows 3-5, cols 3-5\n    b.  If the `content_grid` is not empty:\n        i.  Determine the dimensions (`h`, `w`) of the `content_grid`.\n        ii. Calculate the dimensions to copy: `copy_h = min(h, 3)`, `copy_w = min(w, 3)`.\n        iii. Copy the top-left `copy_h` x `copy_w` portion of the `content_grid` into the target 3x3 area, starting at the top-left corner (e.g., `output[0:copy_h, 0:copy_w]` for TL). The remaining parts of the 3x3 area stay background color (0).\n    c.  If the `content_grid` is empty, the target 3x3 area remains filled with the background color.\n6.  **Return:** The final 6x6 assembled grid."
