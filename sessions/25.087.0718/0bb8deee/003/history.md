The transformation identifies a horizontal and a vertical line of the same 
non-white color that divide the input grid into four quadrants. It then extracts 
the content (non-white pixels) within the minimal bounding box from each 
quadrant. Finally, it assembles these extracted contents into a new, smaller 
grid (specifically 6x6 in the examples), placing each quadrant's content into 
a corresponding 3x3 subgrid (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), 
preserving their relative positions. The dividing lines are discarded.

## General Assessment

The provided code attempts to implement the transformation based on the initial observation: find dividing lines, extract content from quadrants using minimal bounding boxes, and assemble into a 6x6 grid. However, the test results clearly show this approach is incorrect. The transformed outputs significantly differ from the expected outputs, primarily in the content placed within the final 6x6 grid.

The core issue appears to be the `extract_quadrant_content` function and how it determines *what* content to extract. Using the minimal bounding box of non-white pixels within each quadrant discards positional information relative to the dividing lines, which seems crucial. The expected outputs suggest that a fixed-size (3x3) area adjacent to the intersection of the dividing lines within each quadrant is extracted and placed into the corresponding position in the 6x6 output grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Dividing Line Identification:** Re-confirm that `find_dividing_lines` correctly identifies the row, column, and color of the dividers in all examples.
2.  **Analyze Content Mapping:** Examine the input grids and expected output grids to precisely determine which 3x3 section from each input quadrant maps to the corresponding 3x3 section in the output. The hypothesis is that it's the 3x3 area immediately adjacent to the intersection point.
3.  **Refine Extraction Logic:** Modify the extraction process to select this specific 3x3 subgrid from each quadrant instead of calculating a minimal bounding box.
4.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Reflect the corrected understanding of the content extraction and placement process.

The analysis confirms that simply taking the 3x3 region immediately adjacent (corner-to-corner) to the intersection point is also incorrect.

Let's re-examine Example 1:
*   Input `div_row=3`, `div_col=7`. Intersection is at `(3, 7)`.
*   Expected TL output `(0:3, 0:3)`:
    
```
    [[1, 1, 0],
     [0, 1, 0],
     [0, 1, 1]]
    ```

*   Where is this in the input TL quadrant (rows 0-2, cols 0-6)? It's exactly `input[0:3, 2:5]`. This window's bottom-right corner `(2, 4)` is close to the intersection `(3, 7)`.
*   Expected TR output `(0:3, 3:6)`:
    
```
    [[0, 3, 3],
     [3, 3, 0],
     [0, 3, 0]]
    ```

*   Where is this in the input TR quadrant (rows 0-2, cols 8-12)? It's `input[0:3, 10:13]`. This window's bottom-left corner `(2, 10)` is close to the intersection `(3, 7)`.
*   Expected BL output `(3:6, 0:3)`:
    
```
    [[0, 4, 0],
     [4, 0, 4],
     [0, 4, 0]]
    ```

*   Where is this in the input BL quadrant (rows 4-11, cols 0-6)? It's `input[7:10, 1:4]`. This window's top-right corner `(7, 3)` is close to the intersection `(3, 7)`.
*   Expected BR output `(3:6, 3:6)`:
    
```
    [[5, 5, 0],
     [0, 5, 0],
     [0, 0, 5]]
    ```

*   Where is this in the input BR quadrant (rows 4-11, cols 8-12)? It's `input[8:11, 9:12]`. This window's top-left corner `(8, 9)` is close to the intersection `(3, 7)`.

**Revised Hypothesis:** The transformation identifies the dividing lines. It then locates the 3x3 subgrid within each of the four quadrants defined by these lines. The specific 3x3 subgrid chosen from each quadrant is the one whose corner is *closest* to the central intersection point `(div_row, div_col)`. These four 3x3 subgrids are then assembled into a 6x6 output grid, maintaining their relative quadrant positions.

Let's test this on Example 3.
*   Input `div_row=4`, `div_col=6`. Intersection is at `(4, 6)`.
*   TL Quadrant (rows 0-3, cols 0-5). Closest corner to `(4, 6)` is bottom-right. Look for 3x3 ending at `(3, 5)`. Window is `input[1:4, 3:6]`.
    
```
    [[2, 2, 0],
     [0, 2, 0],
     [2, 0, 0]]
    ```

    Expected TL Output:
    
```
    [[0, 2, 2],
     [2, 0, 2],
     [0, 2, 0]]
    ```

    They don't match perfectly, but the shapes (`L`, `cross`) are similar. Wait, the *content* seems right, but the *position* within the 3x3 is shifted.

Let's reconsider the `extract_quadrant_content` function from the original code. It found the minimal bounding box. What if we *don't* crop to the minimal bounding box, but instead take the content from the 3x3 window identified by the "closest corner" rule, and place *that* 3x3 window directly into the output?

**Final Hypothesis:**
1.  Find the horizontal row `div_row` and vertical column `div_col` composed entirely of a single non-white color `C` (ignoring white pixels), which intersect at `(div_row, div_col)`.
2.  Identify the four 3x3 subgrids in the input grid whose corners are closest to the intersection point `(div_row, div_col)`:
    *   Top-Left (TL): `input[div_row-3 : div_row, div_col-3 : div_col]`
    *   Top-Right (TR): `input[div_row-3 : div_row, div_col+1 : div_col+4]`
    *   Bottom-Left (BL): `input[div_row+1 : div_row+4, div_col-3 : div_col]`
    *   Bottom-Right (BR): `input[div_row+1 : div_row+4, div_col+1 : div_col+4]`
3.  Construct a 6x6 output grid.
4.  Copy the TL 3x3 subgrid to `output[0:3, 0:3]`.
5.  Copy the TR 3x3 subgrid to `output[0:3, 3:6]`.
6.  Copy the BL 3x3 subgrid to `output[3:6, 0:3]`.
7.  Copy the BR 3x3 subgrid to `output[3:6, 3:6]`.

This matches the calculation done in the `tool_code` block labeled "Strict Adjacency", which failed. There must be something subtle about the dividing line or the extraction window definition.

Re-reading the original description: "extracts the content (non-white pixels) within the minimal bounding box from each quadrant... places each quadrant's content into a corresponding 3x3 subgrid... preserving their relative positions." This is contradictory. Minimal bounding box *loses* relative position. But maybe the *placement* preserves relative position *within the 3x3 target area*.

What if the minimal bounding box is extracted, and then *placed* into the top-left corner of the corresponding 3x3 output quadrant?

Let's try this on Example 1, TL quadrant:
*   Input TL quadrant (rows 0-2, cols 0-6).
*   Non-white pixels: `(0,2)=1, (0,3)=1, (1,3)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1`.
*   Min row=0, Max row=2. Min col=2, Max col=4.
*   Bounding box content `input[0:3, 2:5]`:
    
```
    [[1, 1, 0],
     [0, 1, 0],
     [0, 1, 1]]
    ```

*   Place this into `output[0:3, 0:3]`. This matches the expected TL output quadrant exactly!

Let's try Example 1, TR quadrant:
*   Input TR quadrant (rows 0-2, cols 8-12).
*   Non-white pixels: `(0,11)=3, (0,12)=3, (1,10)=3, (1,11)=3, (2,11)=3`.
*   Min row=0, Max row=2. Min col=10, Max col=12.
*   Bounding box content `input[0:3, 10:13]`:
    
```
    [[0, 3, 3],
     [3, 3, 0],
     [0, 3, 0]]
    ```

*   Place this into `output[0:3, 3:6]`. This matches the expected TR output quadrant exactly!

Let's try Example 1, BL quadrant:
*   Input BL quadrant (rows 4-11, cols 0-6).
*   Non-white pixels: `(7,2)=4, (8,1)=4, (8,3)=4, (9,2)=4`.
*   Min row=7, Max row=9. Min col=1, Max col=3.
*   Bounding box content `input[7:10, 1:4]`:
    
```
    [[0, 4, 0],
     [4, 0, 4],
     [0, 4, 0]]
    ```

*   Place this into `output[3:6, 0:3]`. This matches the expected BL output quadrant exactly!

Let's try Example 1, BR quadrant:
*   Input BR quadrant (rows 4-11, cols 8-12).
*   Non-white pixels: `(8,9)=5, (8,10)=5, (9,10)=5, (10,11)=5`.
*   Min row=8, Max row=10. Min col=9, Max col=11.
*   Bounding box content `input[8:11, 9:12]`:
    
```
    [[5, 5, 0],
     [0, 5, 0],
     [0, 0, 5]]
    ```

*   Place this into `output[3:6, 3:6]`. This matches the expected BR output quadrant exactly!

This revised approach (minimal bounding box extraction + placement at top-left of 3x3 output quadrant) works perfectly for Example 1. It also aligns better with the initial description. The `place_content` function in the provided code already attempts this, but the `find_dividing_lines` function or the quadrant definitions might be slightly off, leading to the errors seen. The `find_dividing_lines` looks complex and might be failing. A simpler approach might be better.

      - definition: Four rectangular regions defined by the dividing lines.
      - content: Contain various patterns or objects represented by non-white pixels.

output_features:
  - grid: A 6x6 2D array of pixels.
  - structure: Composed of four 3x3 subgrids.
  - subgrids:
      - Top-Left: Corresponds to the input Top-Left quadrant.
      - Top-Right: Corresponds to the input Top-Right quadrant.
      - Bottom-Left: Corresponds to the input Bottom-Left quadrant.
      - Bottom-Right: Corresponds to the input Bottom-Right quadrant.

transformation:
  - action: Identify the single non-white color `C` and the row index `R` and column index `C` such that row `R` and column `C` consist only of color `C` (and potentially white color 0).
  - action: Define the four quadrants relative to the intersection `(R, C)`:
      - TL: `grid[0:R, 0:C]`
      - TR: `grid[0:R, C+1:cols]`
      - BL: `grid[R+1:rows, 0:C]`
      - BR: `grid[R+1:rows, C+1:cols]`
  - action: For each quadrant:
      - step: Identify all non-white pixels within the quadrant.
      - step: If non-white pixels exist, calculate their minimal bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) relative to the full input grid coordinates.
      - step: Extract the content within this bounding box: `extracted_content = grid[min_row : max_row+1, min_col : max_col+1]`.
      - step: If no non-white pixels exist, the extracted_content is empty.
  - action: Create a new 6x6 grid initialized with white (0).
  - action: Place the `extracted_content` from each quadrant into the corresponding 3x3 subgrid of the output grid:
      - TL content -> Place starting at output `(0, 0)`.
      - TR content -> Place starting at output `(0, 3)`.
      - BL content -> Place starting at output `(3, 0)`.
      - BR content -> Place starting at output `(3, 3)`.
      - rule: When placing, ensure the content does not exceed the 3x3 boundary of the target subgrid. If `extracted_content` is larger than 3x3, only the top-left 3x3 part is placed. If smaller, it's placed at the top-left within the 3x3 area, padded with white.

constants:
  - output_grid_size: 6x6
  - output_subgrid_size: 3x3
  - background_color: 0 (white)

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Dividers:** Find the unique non-white color `C` that forms both a complete horizontal line (at row `R`) and a complete vertical line (at column `C`) across the input grid, ignoring any white (0) pixels along these lines. The intersection point is `(R, C)`.
2.  **Define Quadrants:** Use the dividing lines (excluding the lines themselves) to define four rectangular quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).
3.  **Extract Content:** For each quadrant:
    a.  Find all pixels within that quadrant that are not white (0).
    b.  If any non-white pixels are found, determine the smallest rectangle (minimal bounding box) that encloses all of them.
    c.  Extract the grid content within this bounding box. If no non-white pixels were found, the content is empty.
4.  **Assemble Output:** Create a new 6x6 grid, initially all white (0).
5.  **Place Content:** Place the extracted content from each quadrant into the corresponding 3x3 area of the output grid:
    a.  Place TL content into output rows 0-2, columns 0-2.
    b.  Place TR content into output rows 0-2, columns 3-5.
    c.  Place BL content into output rows 3-5, columns 0-2.
    d.  Place BR content into output rows 3-5, columns 3-5.
    *Placement Rule:* Position the extracted content starting at the top-left corner of its designated 3x3 area. If the extracted content is larger than 3x3, crop it, keeping only the top-left 3x3 portion. If it's smaller, it retains its shape and is padded with white within the 3x3 area. Empty content results in an all-white 3x3 area.
