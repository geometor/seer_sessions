The size of the square grid varies across examples (3x3, 2x2, 4x4).\n    *   The output is always a larger, fixed-size 15x15 grid.\n    *   The output grid consists of a white background (color 0) overlaid with a grid pattern.\n    *   The lines forming the grid pattern in the output use the same color as the input grid.\n    *   The position and spacing of the grid lines in the output depend on the dimensions of the input grid. Specifically, if the input grid is NxN:\n        *   The first horizontal and vertical lines appear at index N (0-based).\n        *   Subsequent lines appear with a spacing of N+1 pixels.\n        *   Lines extend across the entire width or height of the 15x15 output grid.\n    *   Pixels where horizontal and vertical lines intersect take the line color.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
