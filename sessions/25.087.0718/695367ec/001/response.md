import numpy as np

"""
Generates a 15x15 grid pattern based on an input NxN grid.

1. Determines the size (N) and uniform color (C) of the input grid.
2. Creates a 15x15 output grid initialized to white (0).
3. Calculates the row and column indices where lines should be drawn.
   The first line is at index N, and subsequent lines are spaced N+1 apart.
4. Draws horizontal lines at the calculated row indices using color C.
5. Draws vertical lines at the calculated column indices using color C.
