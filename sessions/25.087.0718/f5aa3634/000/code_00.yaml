task_type: object_identification_and_extraction
input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      - definition: rectangular subgrids containing patterns of non-white pixels (possibly including internal white pixels)
      - properties: shape, color composition, position (top-left coordinate of bounding box)
      - relationships: multiple instances of the same object/pattern can exist
output_features:
  - grid: a subgrid extracted from the input
  - source: one specific object/pattern from the input
identification_rule:
  - Identify all unique object patterns present in the input grid.
  - Count the occurrences of each unique pattern.
  - Select the pattern that occurs exactly two times.
extraction_rule:
  - Locate both occurrences of the selected pattern.
  - Determine the "first" occurrence based on position: minimum row index of the top-left corner, then minimum column index.
  - The output grid is the subgrid corresponding to this first occurrence.
