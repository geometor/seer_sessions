**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids contain various small, colored "objects" or "patterns" scattered on a white background (color 0). These patterns consist of arrangements of non-white pixels, sometimes including white pixels within their bounding box. The background is predominantly white.
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid. It always corresponds exactly to one of the patterns found within the input grid.
3.  **Relationship:** The core task appears to be identifying a specific pattern within the input grid and extracting it as the output.
4.  **Pattern Identification:** In each example, multiple distinct patterns exist. Some patterns might appear only once, while one specific pattern appears exactly twice.
5.  **Selection Criteria:** The pattern selected for the output is the one that occurs precisely two times in the input grid.
6.  **Instance Selection:** When a pattern occurs twice, the output corresponds to the *first* instance encountered. "First" seems to be defined based on the top-left corner of the pattern's bounding box: prioritize the instance with the minimum row index, and then the minimum column index in case of a tie.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_type: object_identification_and_extraction
input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      - definition: rectangular subgrids containing patterns of non-white pixels (possibly including internal white pixels)
      - properties: shape, color composition, position (top-left coordinate of bounding box)
      - relationships: multiple instances of the same object/pattern can exist
output_features:
  - grid: a subgrid extracted from the input
  - source: one specific object/pattern from the input
identification_rule:
  - Identify all unique object patterns present in the input grid.
  - Count the occurrences of each unique pattern.
  - Select the pattern that occurs exactly two times.
extraction_rule:
  - Locate both occurrences of the selected pattern.
  - Determine the "first" occurrence based on position: minimum row index of the top-left corner, then minimum column index.
  - The output grid is the subgrid corresponding to this first occurrence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct patterns. A pattern is defined as the smallest rectangular subgrid (bounding box) that contains a connected group of non-white pixels, including any white pixels within that rectangle.
2.  Keep track of each unique pattern found and the location (top-left row and column index) of every instance of that pattern.
3.  Count how many times each unique pattern appears in the input grid.
4.  Identify the pattern that appears exactly twice.
5.  Compare the locations (top-left coordinates) of the two instances of this specific pattern.
6.  Select the instance whose top-left corner has the smaller row index. If the row indices are the same, select the instance whose top-left corner has the smaller column index.
7.  Extract the rectangular subgrid corresponding to this selected instance. This subgrid is the output.
