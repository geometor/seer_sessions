These patterns consist of arrangements of non-white pixels, sometimes including white pixels within their bounding box. The background is predominantly white.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid. It always corresponds exactly to one of the patterns found within the input grid.\n3.  **Relationship:** The core task appears to be identifying a specific pattern within the input grid and extracting it as the output.\n4.  **Pattern Identification:** In each example, multiple distinct patterns exist. Some patterns might appear only once, while one specific pattern appears exactly twice.\n5.  **Selection Criteria:** The pattern selected for the output is the one that occurs precisely two times in the input grid.\n6.  **Instance Selection:** When a pattern occurs twice, the output corresponds to the *first* instance encountered. \"First\" seems to be defined based on the top-left corner of the pattern's bounding box: prioritize the instance with the minimum row index, and then the minimum column index in case of a tie.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
