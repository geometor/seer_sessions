task_context:
  description: Summarize object counts per color from the input grid into a structured output grid.
  grid_properties:
    - input_size: large (e.g., 16x16)
    - output_size: variable, smaller than input, determined by color variety and maximum object count.
    - background_color: white (0)
    - object_colors: various non-white colors (1-9)
  object_definition:
    - type: contiguous block of same non-white color
    - connectivity: orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right)
    - properties: color, count (number of instances of that color)
transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: identify_objects
    description: Find all distinct contiguous non-white objects in the input grid.
  - step: 2
    action: group_by_color
    description: Group identified objects based on their color.
  - step: 3
    action: count_objects
    description: Calculate the number of distinct objects for each non-white color.
  - step: 4
    action: sort_colors
    description: Sort the non-white colors based on their object counts in descending order.
  - step: 5
    action: determine_output_dimensions
    inputs: [unique_color_count, max_object_count]
    outputs: [output_height, output_width]
    description: Height is the count of unique non-white colors, Width is the maximum object count.
  - step: 6
    action: construct_output_grid
    inputs: [sorted_colors_with_counts, output_dimensions]
    description: Create the output grid. For each color in the sorted list, add a row containing its object count represented by that many pixels of the color, right-aligned with white padding.
relationships:
  - input_objects -> output_rows: Each unique input color maps to one output row.
  - object_count -> output_row_content: The number of objects of a color determines the number of colored pixels in the corresponding output row.
  - object_count_magnitude -> output_row_order: Colors are ordered in the output based on their object counts (descending).
  - max_object_count -> output_width: The width of the output grid is set by the highest object count.
