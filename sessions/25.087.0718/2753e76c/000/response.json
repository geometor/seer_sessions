The output grid seems to summarize information about the objects present in the input grid.\n3.  **Objects:** Objects are defined as contiguous blocks of the same non-white color. Contiguity appears to be based on side-by-side adjacency (not diagonal).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying all distinct non-white objects in the input, grouping them by color, counting the number of objects for each color, and then representing these counts in the output grid.\n5.  **Output Structure:**\n    *   Each row in the output grid corresponds to a unique non-white color found in the input.\n    *   The number of colored pixels in a row represents the total count of distinct objects of that specific color in the input grid.\n    *   The rows are right-aligned, meaning the colored pixels are at the right end of the row, padded with white pixels (0) on the left if necessary.\n    *   The order of the rows in the output grid is determined by the object count for each color, sorted in descending order. The color with the most objects appears in the first row, the color with the second-most objects in the second row, and so on.\n    *   The dimensions of the output grid are determined by:\n        *   Height: The number of unique non-white colors present in the input.\n        *   Width: The maximum object count found among all colors.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to identify all distinct, contiguous objects of non-white colors. Use orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right) to define contiguity. Keep track of visited pixels during the scan to avoid recounting parts of the same object.\n3.  For each distinct object found, identify its color and increment the count associated with that color in your storage.\n4.  After scanning the entire input grid, determine the list of unique non-white colors present and their corresponding object counts.\n5.

Determine the dimensions of the output grid:\n    *   The height will be the number of unique non-white colors found.\n    *   The width will be the maximum count found among all colors.\n7.
