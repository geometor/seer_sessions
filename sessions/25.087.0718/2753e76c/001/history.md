Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** A relatively large grid (16x16 in all examples) containing multiple shapes (objects) made of different colors (azure, blue, red, green, yellow, etc.) scattered on a white background (color 0).
2.  **Output Grid:** A smaller grid whose dimensions vary between examples (3x3, 4x4, 4x5). The output grid seems to summarize information about the objects present in the input grid.
3.  **Objects:** Objects are defined as contiguous blocks of the same non-white color. Contiguity appears to be based on side-by-side adjacency (not diagonal).
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying all distinct non-white objects in the input, grouping them by color, counting the number of objects for each color, and then representing these counts in the output grid.
5.  **Output Structure:**
    *   Each row in the output grid corresponds to a unique non-white color found in the input.
    *   The number of colored pixels in a row represents the total count of distinct objects of that specific color in the input grid.
    *   The rows are right-aligned, meaning the colored pixels are at the right end of the row, padded with white pixels (0) on the left if necessary.
    *   The order of the rows in the output grid is determined by the object count for each color, sorted in descending order. The color with the most objects appears in the first row, the color with the second-most objects in the second row, and so on.
    *   The dimensions of the output grid are determined by:
        *   Height: The number of unique non-white colors present in the input.
        *   Width: The maximum object count found among all colors.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  description: Summarize object counts per color from the input grid into a structured output grid.
  grid_properties:
    - input_size: large (e.g., 16x16)
    - output_size: variable, smaller than input, determined by color variety and maximum object count.
    - background_color: white (0)
    - object_colors: various non-white colors (1-9)
  object_definition:
    - type: contiguous block of same non-white color
    - connectivity: orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right)
    - properties: color, count (number of instances of that color)
transformation_steps:
  - step: 1

  - step: 2
    action: group_by_color
    description: Group identified objects based on their color.
  - step: 3

  - step: 4
    action: sort_colors
    description: Sort the non-white colors based on their object counts in descending order.
  - step: 5
    action: determine_output_dimensions
    inputs: [unique_color_count, max_object_count]
    outputs: [output_height, output_width]
    description: Height is the count of unique non-white colors, Width is the maximum object count.
  - step: 6
    action: construct_output_grid
    inputs: [sorted_colors_with_counts, output_dimensions]
    description: Create the output grid. For each color in the sorted list, add a row containing its object count represented by that many pixels of the color, right-aligned with white padding.
relationships:
  - input_objects -> output_rows: Each unique input color maps to one output row.
  - object_count -> output_row_content: The number of objects of a color determines the number of colored pixels in the corresponding output row.
  - object_count_magnitude -> output_row_order: Colors are ordered in the output based on their object counts (descending).
  - max_object_count -> output_width: The width of the output grid is set by the highest object count.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty list or dictionary to store object counts for each non-white color found in the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct, contiguous objects of non-white colors. Use orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right) to define contiguity. Keep track of visited pixels during the scan to avoid recounting parts of the same object.
3.  For each distinct object found, identify its color and increment the count associated with that color in your storage.
4.  After scanning the entire input grid, determine the list of unique non-white colors present and their corresponding object counts.
5.  Sort this list of (color, count) pairs in descending order based on the count.
6.  Determine the dimensions of the output grid:
    *   The height will be the number of unique non-white colors found.
    *   The width will be the maximum count found among all colors.
7.  Create a new grid with the calculated height and width, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
8.  Iterate through the sorted list of (color, count) pairs. For each pair, starting from the first row (row index 0) of the output grid:
    *   Fill the rightmost `count` cells of the current row with the `color`.
9.  Return the constructed output grid.
