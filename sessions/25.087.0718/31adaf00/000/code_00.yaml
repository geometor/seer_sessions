Colors:
  - White: 0
  - Blue: 1
  - Gray: 5

Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of pixels.
  - Pixel: A single cell in the grid with a color value.
  - White_Block_3x1: A contiguous vertical block of 3 white pixels.
  - White_Block_1x3: A contiguous horizontal block of 3 white pixels.
  - Gray_Pixel: A pixel with color 5.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (8-connectivity neighbours).
  - Transformation_Trigger: A White_Block (3x1 or 1x3) is transformed if it has an adjacent Gray_Pixel neighbour (neighbour must not be part of the block).

Actions:
  - Find: Locate all instances of White_Block_3x1 and White_Block_1x3 in the input grid.
  - Check_Neighbours: For each White_Block, examine its adjacent pixels (excluding pixels within the block itself).
  - Conditional_Change: If any adjacent neighbour pixel is a Gray_Pixel (in the input), change all pixels within the corresponding White_Block from white (0) to blue (1) in the output grid.
  - Copy: Pixels not part of a transformed White_Block retain their original color from the input grid.
