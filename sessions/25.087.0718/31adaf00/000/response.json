            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of the Elements**\n\n1.  **Colors:** The input grids primarily use white (0) and gray (5). The output grids introduce blue (1) while retaining white and gray.\n2.  **Input Structure:** The gray pixels seem randomly scattered or form small, irregular clusters. Large areas are filled with white pixels.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The gray pixels remain in their original positions. Some white pixels are replaced by blue pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the conversion of specific white pixels (0) to blue pixels (1).\n5.  **Pattern:** The blue pixels always appear in either `3x1` vertical blocks or `1x3` horizontal blocks. These blue blocks correspond directly to `3x1` or `1x3` blocks of white pixels in the input grid.\n6.  **Condition:** A block of 3 white pixels (either vertical or horizontal) seems to turn blue if and only if at least one pixel immediately adjacent (including diagonals) to any pixel within that block is gray (5) in the input grid. The gray pixel triggering the change must be *outside* the 3-pixel white block itself.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

If the pixels at `(r, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, and `(r+2, c)` (within grid boundaries) are all white (0), then identify this as a `White_Block_3x1`.\n    b.  Find all 8-connectivity neighbours for each of the three pixels in this block: `(r, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r+2, c)`.\n    c.  Create a set of unique neighbour coordinates.\n    d.  Remove the coordinates `(r, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r+2, c)` from this set.\n    e.  Check if any pixel in the input grid at these remaining neighbour coordinates is gray (5).\n    f.
