Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of the Elements**

1.  **Colors:** The input grids primarily use white (0) and gray (5). The output grids introduce blue (1) while retaining white and gray.
2.  **Input Structure:** The gray pixels seem randomly scattered or form small, irregular clusters. Large areas are filled with white pixels.
3.  **Output Structure:** The gray pixels remain in their original positions. Some white pixels are replaced by blue pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the conversion of specific white pixels (0) to blue pixels (1).
5.  **Pattern:** The blue pixels always appear in either `3x1` vertical blocks or `1x3` horizontal blocks. These blue blocks correspond directly to `3x1` or `1x3` blocks of white pixels in the input grid.
6.  **Condition:** A block of 3 white pixels (either vertical or horizontal) seems to turn blue if and only if at least one pixel immediately adjacent (including diagonals) to any pixel within that block is gray (5) in the input grid. The gray pixel triggering the change must be *outside* the 3-pixel white block itself.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Colors:
  - White: 0
  - Blue: 1
  - Gray: 5

Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of pixels.
  - Pixel: A single cell in the grid with a color value.
  - White_Block_3x1: A contiguous vertical block of 3 white pixels.
  - White_Block_1x3: A contiguous horizontal block of 3 white pixels.
  - Gray_Pixel: A pixel with color 5.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (8-connectivity neighbours).
  - Transformation_Trigger: A White_Block (3x1 or 1x3) is transformed if it has an adjacent Gray_Pixel neighbour (neighbour must not be part of the block).

Actions:
  - Find: Locate all instances of White_Block_3x1 and White_Block_1x3 in the input grid.
  - Check_Neighbours: For each White_Block, examine its adjacent pixels (excluding pixels within the block itself).
  - Conditional_Change: If any adjacent neighbour pixel is a Gray_Pixel (in the input), change all pixels within the corresponding White_Block from white (0) to blue (1) in the output grid.
  - Copy: Pixels not part of a transformed White_Block retain their original color from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Create a list or set to store the coordinates of all white pixels that need to be changed to blue.
3.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid to check for the start of a potential `3x1` vertical white block.
    a.  If the pixels at `(r, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, and `(r+2, c)` (within grid boundaries) are all white (0), then identify this as a `White_Block_3x1`.
    b.  Find all 8-connectivity neighbours for each of the three pixels in this block: `(r, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r+2, c)`.
    c.  Create a set of unique neighbour coordinates.
    d.  Remove the coordinates `(r, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r+2, c)` from this set.
    e.  Check if any pixel in the input grid at these remaining neighbour coordinates is gray (5).
    f.  If a gray neighbour is found, add the coordinates `(r, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, and `(r+2, c)` to the list of pixels to be changed to blue.
4.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid to check for the start of a potential `1x3` horizontal white block.
    a.  If the pixels at `(r, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, and `(r, c+2)` (within grid boundaries) are all white (0), then identify this as a `White_Block_1x3`.
    b.  Find all 8-connectivity neighbours for each of the three pixels in this block: `(r, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, `(r, c+2)`.
    c.  Create a set of unique neighbour coordinates.
    d.  Remove the coordinates `(r, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, `(r, c+2)` from this set.
    e.  Check if any pixel in the input grid at these remaining neighbour coordinates is gray (5).
    f.  If a gray neighbour is found, add the coordinates `(r, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, and `(r, c+2)` to the list of pixels to be changed to blue.
5.  Iterate through the unique coordinates collected in the list from steps 3f and 4f.
6.  For each coordinate `(r_change, c_change)` in the list, set the pixel value at `(r_change, c_change)` in the output grid to blue (1).
7.  Return the final output grid.
