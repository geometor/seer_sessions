These shapes appear to be hollow, forming boundaries around regions of white pixels. The output grids retain the original gray shapes but modify the white pixels both inside and directly above these shapes. Specifically, the white area enclosed by each gray shape is filled with red pixels (2). Additionally, a horizontal red line (2) is drawn one row above the top extent of each gray shape, spanning the width defined by the shape's leftmost and rightmost points.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
