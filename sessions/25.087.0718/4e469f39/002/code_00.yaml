task_description: Processes grids containing gray shapes on a white background.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Variable height and width (up to 30x30).
  - colors_used_input: white (0), gray (5).
  - colors_used_output: white (0), gray (5), red (2).
objects:
  - type: contiguous_shape
    color: gray (5)
    attributes:
      - pixels: set of (row, col) coordinates.
      - bounding_box: (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) derived from pixels.
actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    input: input_grid
    target_color: gray (5)
    connectivity: 4-way (assumed standard for ARC object definition)
    output: list of gray objects (sets of coordinates).
  - action: process_each_object
    input: gray object, input_grid
    output: modified_output_grid
    sub_actions:
      - step: calculate_bounding_box
        input: object_pixels
        output: bbox = (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)
      - step: draw_line_above
        condition: min_r > 0
        effect: change pixels in output_grid at row `min_r - 1`, columns `min_c` to `max_c` (inclusive) to red (2).
      - step: fill_interior_white # Rule needs correction
        # Hypothesis 1 (Failed): Fill white pixels within bbox not reachable from grid border (4-way or 8-way).
        # Hypothesis 2 (Failed): Fill white pixels within bbox "surrounded" (ray cast) by object's gray pixels.
        # Hypothesis 3 (Failed): Fill white pixels based on number of gray neighbors.
        # Correct Rule (Unknown): Identify specific white pixels 'inside' the gray object and change them to red (2). The examples show these pixels exist, but the exact condition is unclear.
        effect: change specific white (0) pixels associated with the object to red (2) in the output_grid.
grid_modification:
  - preserve_pixels: All gray (5) pixels from the input remain unchanged. White (0) pixels not affected by actions remain unchanged.
  - add_pixels: Red (2) pixels are added based on the 'draw_line_above' and 'fill_interior_white' actions.
