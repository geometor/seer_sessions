            "text": "**Analysis of Reachability Results:**\n\nThe code execution confirms that *all* white pixels in the input grids are reachable from the border using 4-way connectivity. This means the hypothesis: \"fill white pixels that are not reachable from the border\" is definitively wrong. The previous code failed because the condition `(r, c) not in reachable_white` was never true for any white pixel.\n\n**New Hypothesis for Interior Fill:**\n\nLet's reconsider the concept of \"enclosed\". Perhaps it relates to the gray object itself acting as a barrier.\n\nConsider Example 1's gray object `obj_coords = {(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5)}`.\nThe pixels to be filled are `interior_pixels_1 = {(3,4), (4,3), (4,4), (5,3), (5,4)}`.\n\nWhat if we perform a flood fill (BFS) starting from *all* border pixels, but this time, the flood fill can only traverse white (0) pixels and cannot cross gray (5) pixels? The pixels that remain unvisited by this flood fill *and* are white in the input might be the ones to turn red.\n\nLet's test this revised flood fill idea.\n\n"

The flood fill starting from the border and restricted to white pixels still reaches *all* white pixels in the input grids. This means the gray shapes do not fully enclose any white regions according to standard 4-way connectivity.\n\n**New Hypothesis - Pixel Neighborhood:**\n\nLet's examine the local neighborhood of the white pixels that turn red.\n\n*   Example 1: `(3,4)` -> Neighbors: `(3,3)`(G), `(3,5)`(G), `(2,4)`(W), `(4,4)`(W->R).\n*   Example 1: `(4,3)` -> Neighbors: `(4,2)`(G), `(4,4)`(W->R), `(3,3)`(G), `(5,3)`(W->R).\n*   Example 1: `(4,4)` -> Neighbors: `(4,3)`(W->R), `(4,5)`(G), `(3,4)`(W->R), `(5,4)`(W->R).\n*   Example 1: `(5,3)` -> Neighbors: `(5,2)`(G), `(5,4)`(W->R), `(4,3)`(W->R), `(6,3)`(G).\n*   Example 1: `(5,4)` -> Neighbors: `(5,3)`(W->R), `(5,5)`(G), `(4,4)`(W->R), `(6,4)`(G).\n\nObservations:\n*   All filled pixels are adjacent (4-way or 8-way) to at least one gray pixel.\n*   All filled pixels have gray pixels blocking them in certain directions.\n*   Perhaps the rule relates to pixels that are white, adjacent to a gray pixel belonging to the object, and lie *within* the bounding box of the gray object?\n\nLet's test this: \"A pixel turns red if it is white (0) in the input, it is within the bounding box of a gray object, AND it is 4-way adjacent to at least one gray pixel belonging to that specific object.\"\n\n*   Example 1: Bbox (r=3-6, c=2-5).\n    *   `(3,4)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to gray `(3,3)` and `(3,5)`. -> Turns Red. Correct.\n    *   `(4,3)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to gray `(4,2)` and `(5,2)` (via `(5,3)`)? No, just `(4,2)`. -> Turns Red. Correct.\n    *   `(4,4)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to gray `(4,5)`. -> Turns Red. Correct.\n    *   `(5,3)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to gray `(5,2)`. -> Turns Red. Correct.\n    *   `(5,4)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to gray `(5,5)`. -> Turns Red. Correct.\n    *   Are there others? Pixel `(3,6)` is white, adjacent to `(3,5)` (gray), but outside bbox. Pixel `(4,1)` is white, adjacent to `(4,2)` (gray), but outside bbox. Pixel `(7,2)` is white, adjacent to `(6,2)` (gray), but outside bbox. This looks promising.\n\n*   Example 2: Bbox (r=3-7, c=3-6). Filled pixels: `{(3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5), (6,4), (6,5)}`.\n    *   `(3,4)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to gray `(3,3)`. -> Red. Correct.\n    *   `(4,4)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to gray `(4,3)`. -> Red. Correct.\n    *   `(4,5)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to gray `(4,6)`. -> Red. Correct.\n    *   `(5,4)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to gray `(5,3)`. -> Red. Correct.\n    *   `(5,5)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to gray `(5,6)`. -> Red. Correct.\n    *   `(6,4)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to gray `(6,3)`. -> Red. Correct.\n    *   `(6,5)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to gray `(6,6)`. -> Red. Correct.\n    *   This matches Example 2 perfectly.\n\n*   Example 3:\n    *   Object 1: Bbox (r=2-5, c=1-4). Filled pixels: `{(2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3)}`.\n        *   `(2,2)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to `(2,1)` (G). -> Red. Correct.\n        *   `(3,2)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to `(3,1)` (G). -> Red. Correct.\n        *   `(3,3)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to `(3,4)` (G). -> Red. Correct.\n        *   `(4,2)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to `(4,1)` (G). -> Red. Correct.\n        *   `(4,3)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to `(4,4)` (G). -> Red. Correct. Matches Object 1.\n    *   Object 2: Bbox (r=7-9, c=5-8). Filled pixels: `{(7,7), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)}`.\n        *   `(7,7)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to `(7,6)` (G), `(7,8)` (G). -> Red. Correct.\n        *   `(8,6)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to `(8,5)` (G). -> Red. Correct.\n        *   `(8,7)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to `(9,7)` (G). -> Red. Correct.\n        *   `(8,8)`: White, in bbox, adjacent to `(8,9)`? No, `(8,9)` is 0. Adjacent to `(9,8)` (G). -> Red. Correct. Matches Object 2.\n\nThis adjacency hypothesis seems to hold for all examples.\n\n**Refining the Red Line:**\n\n*   The code places the red line at `r = min_r - 1`, from `c = min_c` to `max_c`.\n*   Example 1: Bbox (r=3-6, c=2-5). Line at `r=2`, `c=2..5`. Expected: `r=2, c=2..5`. Match.\n*   Example 2: Bbox (r=3-7, c=3-6). Line at `r=2`, `c=3..6`. Expected: `r=2, c=4..7`? No, `r=2, c=3..6`. Match. Expected Output Check: Line at r=2. Columns 3, 4, 5, 6. Yes, `c=3..6`.\n*   Example 3, Obj 1: Bbox (r=2-5, c=1-4). Line at `r=1`, `c=1..4`. Expected: `r=1, c=1..4`. Match.\n*   Example 3, Obj 2: Bbox (r=7-9, c=5-8). Line at `r=6`, `c=5..8`. Expected: `r=6, c=5..8`. Match.\n\nThe red line logic seems correct as implemented. The previous difference report for Example 1 must have been solely due to the fill pixels.\n\n**Final Plan Summary:**\n\n1.  Identify all gray (5) objects using 4-way connectivity.\n2.  For each gray object:\n    a. Calculate its bounding box (`min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c`).\n    b. If the object does not touch the top border (`min_r > 0`), draw a horizontal red (2) line in the output grid at row `min_r - 1`, spanning columns from `min_c` to `max_c` (inclusive).\n    c. Iterate through all pixels `(r, c)` within the object's bounding box (`min_r <= r <= max_r`, `min_c <= c <= max_c`).\n    d. If a pixel `(r, c)` is white (0) in the input grid *and* it has at least one 4-way adjacent neighbor that is part of the *current* gray object, change this pixel `(r, c)` to red (2) in the output grid.\n3.  All other pixels retain their original color from the input grid (including the gray pixels themselves).\n\nThis plan seems robust across all examples.\n\n---\n## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the gray objects and implemented the rule for drawing a red line above the object's bounding box (if not touching the top border). However, the logic for filling interior white pixels with red was incorrect. The initial hypothesis, based on reachability from the grid border, was disproven by the examples and subsequent testing. The transformed outputs consistently lacked the expected red filled pixels, leading to mismatches.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the rule for determining which white pixels should turn red. The analysis suggests a new rule based on adjacency to the gray object *within* its bounding box.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input: 10x10 grid, one gray 'U' object (11 pixels).\n*   Expected Output: Red line (4 pixels) at r=2, c=2-5. Red fill (5 pixels) at `{(3,4), (4,3), (4,4), (5,3), (5,4)}`. Total Red: 9.\n*   Transformed Output (Previous): Red line (4 pixels) at r=2, c=2-5. No red fill. Total Red: 4.\n*   Observation: Fill rule failed. Line rule seems correct. Fill pixels are white in input, within gray object's bbox, and adjacent (4-way) to a gray pixel of the object.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input: 10x10 grid, one gray 'C' object (12 pixels).\n*   Expected Output: Red line (4 pixels) at r=2, c=3-6. Red fill (7 pixels) at `{(3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5), (6,4), (6,5)}`. Total Red: 11.\n*   Transformed Output (Previous): Red line (4 pixels) at r=2, c=3-6. No red fill. Total Red: 4.\n*   Observation: Fill rule failed. Line rule correct. Fill pixels are white in input, within gray object's bbox, and adjacent (4-way) to a gray pixel of the object.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input: 10x10 grid, two gray objects ('U' top-left, 'C' bottom-right). Object 1 (11 pixels), Object 2 (10 pixels).\n*   Expected Output:\n    *   Object 1: Red line (4 pixels) at r=1, c=1-4. Red fill (5 pixels) at `{(2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3)}`.\n    *   Object 2: Red line (4 pixels) at r=6, c=5-8. Red fill (4 pixels) at `{(7,7), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)}`.\n    *   Total Red: 4+5+4+4 = 17.\n*   Transformed Output (Previous):\n    *   Object 1: Red line (4 pixels) at r=1, c=1-4. No red fill.\n    *   Object 2: Red line (4 pixels) at r=6, c=5-8. No red fill.\n    *   Total Red: 4+4 = 8.\n*   Observation: Fill rule failed for both objects. Line rule correct for both. Fill pixels associated with each object are white in input, within that object's respective bbox, and adjacent (4-way) to a gray pixel of that specific object.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
