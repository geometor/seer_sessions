"""
Transforms the input grid based on gray (5) objects.
1. Identifies contiguous gray (5) objects using 4-way adjacency.
2. For each gray object:
    a. Determines its bounding box (min/max row and column).
    b. If the object is not touching the top border (min_row > 0), draws a 
       horizontal red (2) line in the output grid one row above the object's 
       bounding box, spanning the width of the bounding box (min_col to max_col).
    c. Identifies and fills certain white (0) pixels, notionally "inside" the 
       gray object, with red (2). The exact rule for this interior fill is 
       unclear from the examples, as simple reachability from the border does 
       not match. This implementation uses a placeholder logic based on the 
       failed hypothesis of filling white pixels within the bounding box that are 
       not reachable from the grid border via other white pixels (4-way). 
       This part likely needs correction based on further analysis.
3. Gray pixels remain unchanged. Other white pixels remain unchanged.
