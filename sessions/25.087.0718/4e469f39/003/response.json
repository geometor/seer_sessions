Identifies contiguous gray (5) objects using 4-way adjacency.\n2. For each gray object:\n    a. Determines its bounding box (min/max row and column).\n    b. If the object is not touching the top border (min_row > 0), draws a \n       horizontal red (2) line in the output grid one row above the object's \n       bounding box, spanning the width of the bounding box (min_col to max_col).\n    c. Identifies and fills certain white (0) pixels, notionally \"inside\" the \n       gray object, with red (2). The exact rule for this interior fill is \n       unclear from the examples, as simple reachability from the border does \n       not match. This implementation uses a placeholder logic based on the \n       failed hypothesis of filling white pixels within the bounding box that are \n       not reachable from the grid border via other white pixels (4-way). \n       This part likely needs correction based on further analysis.\n3. Gray pixels remain unchanged. Other white pixels remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color_code):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of a specific color in the grid using 4-way adjacency.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        color_code (int): The color code of the objects to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of sets, where each set contains tuples of (row, col)\n              coordinates for one object.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == color_code and not visited[r, c]:\n                current_object = set()\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                \n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    current_object.add((row, col))\n                    \n                    # Check 4 neighbors (standard ARC connectivity for objects)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        \n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == color_code and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                \n                if current_object:\n                    objects.append(current_object)\n                    \n    return objects\n\ndef get_bounding_box(obj_coords):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bounding box for a set of coordinates.\n\n    Args:\n        obj_coords (set): A set of (row, col) tuples.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) or None if coords is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not obj_coords:\n        return None\n    \n    rows = [r for r, c in obj_coords]\n    cols = [c for r, c in obj_coords]\n    \n    min_r = min(rows)\n    max_r = max(rows)\n    min_c = min(cols)\n    max_c = max(cols)\n    \n    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    \n    # Find all gray objects\n    gray_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 5)\n\n    # --- Determine globally reachable white pixels (Hypothesis for interior fill) ---\n    # This approach was shown to be incorrect in analysis, but implemented as placeholder.\n    reachable_white = set()\n    q_reachable = deque()\n    \n    # Add border white pixels to the queue\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in [0, cols - 1]:\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 0 and (r, c) not in reachable_white:\n                q_reachable.append((r, c))\n                reachable_white.add((r, c))\n    for c in range(cols):\n        for r in [0, rows - 1]:\n             if input_grid[r, c] == 0 and (r, c) not in reachable_white:\n                q_reachable.append((r, c))\n                reachable_white.add((r, c))\n\n    # Perform BFS (4-way) to find all reachable white pixels\n    while q_reachable:\n        r, c = q_reachable.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n               input_grid[nr, nc] == 0 and (nr, nc) not in reachable_white:\n                reachable_white.add((nr, nc))\n                q_reachable.append((nr, nc))\n    # --- End finding reachable white pixels ---\n\n    # Process each gray object\n    for obj_coords in gray_objects:\n        # a.
