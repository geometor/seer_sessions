Input:
  Grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
  Contains:
    - Background: Color white (0).
    - Objects: Contiguous or scattered pixels of a single non-white color. Multiple objects of different colors can exist. Objects can overlap.
Properties:
  - Object Color: The specific non-white color (1-9) of an object's pixels.
  - Object Height: The vertical span of an object, calculated as (maximum row index containing the color) - (minimum row index containing the color) + 1.
Output:
  Grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9). Smaller than input.
  Contains:
    - Vertical Columns: Each column represents one unique color from the input objects.
    - Background: Color white (0) padding below colored segments in columns and potentially empty columns if calculation differs.
Relationships:
  - Output Columns to Input Objects: Each column corresponds to one unique non-white color found in the input.
  - Column Order: Columns are ordered left-to-right based on the descending height of the corresponding input objects. Tallest object's color forms the leftmost column.
  - Column Height: The number of colored cells (from the top) in an output column equals the calculated height of the corresponding input object.
  - Output Grid Dimensions:
    - Width: Number of unique non-white colors in the input.
    - Height: Maximum height among all input objects.
