Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input is a grid containing multiple distinct objects, each composed of a single, non-white color. These objects are often rectangular or L-shaped, and some may partially overlap or touch. The background is white (0).
2.  **Output Structure:** The output is a much smaller grid. It consists of vertical columns of color against a white background. Each column uses one of the colors present in the input objects.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to summarize the colored objects from the input grid. The key properties seem to be the color and the vertical extent (height) of each object in the input.
4.  **Object Identification:** The task requires identifying all unique non-white colors present in the input grid. Each unique color represents a distinct object type for the purpose of this transformation.
5.  **Height Calculation:** For each unique color, its "height" needs to be determined. This height corresponds to the number of rows spanned by the object of that color in the input grid (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum row index containing that color, plus one).
6.  **Output Generation:**
    *   The output grid's width is determined by the number of unique non-white colors found in the input.
    *   The output grid's height is determined by the maximum height calculated among all colored objects.
    *   The columns in the output grid represent the input objects, ordered from left to right based on their calculated height in descending order (tallest object first).
    *   Each column in the output is filled from the top with the corresponding object's color. The number of colored cells in a column matches the calculated height of that object in the input. The remaining cells below the colored portion in each column are filled with the background color (white).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  Grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
  Contains:
    - Background: Color white (0).
    - Objects: Contiguous or scattered pixels of a single non-white color. Multiple objects of different colors can exist. Objects can overlap.
Properties:
  - Object Color: The specific non-white color (1-9) of an object's pixels.
  - Object Height: The vertical span of an object, calculated as (maximum row index containing the color) - (minimum row index containing the color) + 1.
Output:
  Grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9). Smaller than input.
  Contains:
    - Vertical Columns: Each column represents one unique color from the input objects.
    - Background: Color white (0) padding below colored segments in columns and potentially empty columns if calculation differs.
Relationships:
  - Output Columns to Input Objects: Each column corresponds to one unique non-white color found in the input.
  - Column Order: Columns are ordered left-to-right based on the descending height of the corresponding input objects. Tallest object's color forms the leftmost column.
  - Column Height: The number of colored cells (from the top) in an output column equals the calculated height of the corresponding input object.
  - Output Grid Dimensions:
    - Width: Number of unique non-white colors in the input.
    - Height: Maximum height among all input objects.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
2.  For each unique non-white color found:
    a.  Find all row indices where this color appears.
    b.  Calculate the "height" for this color as `(maximum row index) - (minimum row index) + 1`.
    c.  Store the color and its calculated height.
3.  Determine the maximum height (`max_height`) among all calculated heights.
4.  Determine the number of unique non-white colors (`num_colors`).
5.  Sort the unique colors based on their calculated heights in descending order (tallest first). If two colors have the same height, their relative order doesn't appear to be specified by the examples, but consistency (e.g., sorting by color index as a tie-breaker) might be needed. *Correction based on examples: Tie-breaking doesn't seem necessary or tested in the provided examples.*
6.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `max_height` rows and `num_colors` columns, initialized with the background color white (0).
7.  Iterate through the sorted colors (from tallest to shortest):
    a.  For the current color and its height (`h`), select the next available column index in the output grid (starting from 0).
    b.  Fill the cells in this column from row 0 down to row `h-1` with the current color.
8.  Return the generated output grid.
