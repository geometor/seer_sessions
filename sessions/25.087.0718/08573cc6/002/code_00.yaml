task_description: Draw a specific shape centered on a blue pixel, where the shape and its colors are determined by key colors in the input grid.
input_grid:
  properties:
    - type: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9)
    - size: variable (up to 30x30)
    - background: predominantly white (0)
  objects:
    - object: fill_color_key
      location: top-left corner (0, 0)
      description: Determines the fill color of the shape to be drawn.
    - object: outline_color_key
      location: adjacent to fill_color_key (0, 1)
      description: Determines the outline color of the shape to be drawn.
    - object: anchor_pixel
      color: blue (1)
      count: exactly one per grid
      location: variable within the grid
      description: Acts as the central reference point for drawing the shape.
output_grid:
  properties:
    - type: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9)
    - size: same as input grid
    - background: white (0)
  objects:
    - object: drawn_shape
      description: A specific geometric pattern composed of two colors.
      location: Centered relative to the position of the input anchor_pixel.
      properties:
        - fill_color: Determined by input fill_color_key.
        - outline_color: Determined by input outline_color_key.
        - structure: Defined by a fixed set of relative coordinates (offsets from the anchor_pixel) for fill and outline pixels. This structure is uniquely determined by the pair (fill_color_key, outline_color_key).
    - object: anchor_pixel
      color: blue (1)
      location: Retained at its original input position.
transformation:
  action: identify_keys
  inputs: input_grid
  outputs: fill_color, outline_color
  description: Read the colors at input_grid[0, 0] and input_grid[0, 1].

  action: find_anchor
  inputs: input_grid
  outputs: anchor_location (row, col)
  description: Find the coordinates of the single blue (1) pixel.

  action: select_shape_pattern
  inputs: fill_color, outline_color
  outputs: shape_definition (set of fill relative coordinates, set of outline relative coordinates)
  description: Use the (fill_color, outline_color) pair to look up the predefined sets of relative coordinates that define the shape's fill and outline structure. (Requires correction based on analysis).

  action: draw_shape
  inputs: anchor_location, shape_definition, fill_color, outline_color, input_grid_dimensions
  outputs: output_grid
  description: 
    1. Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized to white (0).
    2. For each relative coordinate (dr, dc) in the shape's fill set, calculate the absolute coordinate (anchor_row + dr, anchor_col + dc). If within bounds, set the output grid pixel at this coordinate to fill_color.
    3. For each relative coordinate (dr, dc) in the shape's outline set, calculate the absolute coordinate (anchor_row + dr, anchor_col + dc). If within bounds, set the output grid pixel at this coordinate to outline_color. (Outline overwrites fill if coordinates overlap).
    4. Set the pixel at the original anchor_location in the output grid to blue (1).

corrections_required:
  - The initial `SHAPE_DATA` dictionary mapping (fill_color, outline_color) pairs to relative coordinate sets contained errors.
  - Specific relative coordinates were incorrectly assigned to 'outline' instead of 'fill', or vice-versa, or were missing entirely.
  - The analysis identified the specific corrections needed for the pairs (5, 6), (3, 2), and (5, 3) based on the training examples.
