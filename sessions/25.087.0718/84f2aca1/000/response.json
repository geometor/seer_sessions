The transformation fills these enclosed white areas with a new color, either gray (5) or orange (7). The original colored shapes remain otherwise unchanged. The key is to determine the rule that decides whether to fill with gray or orange. Comparing the examples, it appears the fill color depends on the total number of white pixels enclosed within a single continuous shape object.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
