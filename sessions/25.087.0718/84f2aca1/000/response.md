*   **Perception:** The task involves modifying input grids that contain various colored shapes (objects). These shapes sometimes enclose areas of white pixels (color 0). The transformation fills these enclosed white areas with a new color, either gray (5) or orange (7). The original colored shapes remain otherwise unchanged. The key is to determine the rule that decides whether to fill with gray or orange. Comparing the examples, it appears the fill color depends on the total number of white pixels enclosed within a single continuous shape object.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Fill enclosed white areas within colored shapes based on the total count of enclosed pixels per shape.
    
    elements:
      - element: grid
        description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9.
      - element: shape
        description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels (color 1-9).
        properties:
          - color: The color value (1-9) of the pixels making up the shape.
          - pixels: Coordinates of the pixels belonging to the shape.
          - bounding_box: The minimum rectangle enclosing the shape.
      - element: enclosed_area
        description: A contiguous area of white pixels (color 0) completely surrounded by the pixels of a single shape.
        properties:
          - pixels: Coordinates of the white pixels in the area.
          - size: The number of pixels in the area.
          - parent_shape: The shape object that encloses this area.
      - element: total_enclosed_pixels_per_shape
        description: The sum of the sizes of all distinct enclosed_areas belonging to a single shape object.
    
    transformation:
      - action: identify_shapes
        description: Find all distinct shape objects in the input grid.
      - action: find_enclosed_areas
        description: For each shape, identify all white pixels completely surrounded by that shape's pixels. Group contiguous surrounded white pixels into enclosed_area objects.
      - action: calculate_total_enclosed_pixels
        description: For each shape, sum the sizes (pixel counts) of all enclosed_areas associated with it.
      - action: determine_fill_color
        input: total_enclosed_pixels_per_shape
        output: fill_color (Gray=5 or Orange=7)
        rule:
          - condition: If total_enclosed_pixels_per_shape == 1
            result: fill_color = Gray (5)
          - condition: If total_enclosed_pixels_per_shape > 1
            result: fill_color = Orange (7)
      - action: apply_fill
        description: Modify the input grid by changing the color of all pixels within the identified enclosed_areas to the determined fill_color.
    
    relationships:
      - type: containment
        from: shape
        to: enclosed_area
        description: A shape encloses one or more areas of white pixels.
    
    constraints:
      - Only white pixels fully enclosed by a single continuous shape object are modified.
      - The original shape pixels are not modified.
      - Background white pixels (not enclosed) are not modified.
    
    output_grid: The modified input grid after applying the fill colors to the enclosed areas.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each non-white color present in the input grid to identify distinct shape objects.
    3.  For each distinct shape object (a contiguous block of the same non-white color):
        a.  Identify all white (0) pixels that are completely enclosed by this shape object. A white pixel is enclosed if all paths from it to the grid boundary must pass through a pixel belonging to the current shape object.
        b.  Count the total number (`N`) of such enclosed white pixels belonging to this specific shape object.
        c.  Determine the fill color:
            i.  If `N` equals 1, the fill color is Gray (5).
            ii. If `N` is greater than 1, the fill color is Orange (7).
        d.  If `N` is greater than 0, change the color of all the identified enclosed white pixels (associated with this shape) in the output grid to the determined fill color.
    4.  Return the modified output grid.
