Identify distinct contiguous shapes made of non-white pixels (colors 1-9) in the input grid.\n2. For each shape, find all white pixels (color 0) that are completely enclosed by that shape. A white pixel is enclosed if any path from it to the grid boundary must pass through a pixel belonging to that specific shape.\n3. Count the total number (N) of enclosed white pixels associated with each individual shape.\n4. Determine the fill color for the enclosed areas of each shape based on N:\n    - If N = 1, the fill color is Gray (5).\n    - If N > 1, the fill color is Orange (7).\n5. Create the output grid by copying the input grid and then changing the color of all identified enclosed white pixels to their corresponding determined fill color. White pixels not enclosed by any single shape remain white. Shape pixels remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of a given color in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        color (int): The color of the objects to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[set]: A list where each element is a set of (row, col) tuples\n                   representing the pixels of a single object.\n    \"\"\"\n    H, W = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    for r in range(H):\n        for c in range(W):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and not visited[r, c]:\n                obj_pixels = set()\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                obj_pixels.add((r, c))\n\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < H and 0 <= nc < W and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            obj_pixels.add((nr, nc))\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                if obj_pixels:\n                    objects.append(obj_pixels)\n    return objects\n\ndef check_enclosure(grid, start_r, start_c, target_shape_pixels):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a white area starting at (start_r, start_c) is enclosed by\n    the target_shape_pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        start_r (int): Starting row of the white pixel.\n        start_c (int): Starting column of the white pixel.\n        target_shape_pixels (set): Set of (r, c) tuples for the potential enclosing shape.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (is_enclosed, enclosed_area_pixels, needs_processing)\n               is_enclosed (bool): True if the white area is enclosed by target_shape_pixels.\n               enclosed_area_pixels (set): Set of (r,c) tuples of the connected white area found.\n               needs_processing (bool): True if the white area found does not touch the boundary.\n                                        (False means it touches boundary or is invalid).\n    \"\"\"\n    H, W = grid.shape\n    q = deque([(start_r, start_c)])\n    visited_white = set([(start_r, start_c)])\n    neighboring_non_white = set()\n    reached_boundary = False\n\n    # BFS to find connected white area and its neighbors\n    while q:\n        r, c = q.popleft()\n\n        # Check boundary contact\n        if r == 0 or r == H -
