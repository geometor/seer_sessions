Transformation Rule:
1. Identify distinct contiguous shapes made of non-white pixels (colors 1-9) in the input grid.
2. For each shape, find all white pixels (color 0) that are completely enclosed by that shape. A white pixel is enclosed if any path from it to the grid boundary must pass through a pixel belonging to that specific shape.
3. Count the total number (N) of enclosed white pixels associated with each individual shape.
4. Determine the fill color for the enclosed areas of each shape based on N:
    - If N = 1, the fill color is Gray (5).
    - If N > 1, the fill color is Orange (7).
5. Create the output grid by copying the input grid and then changing the color of all identified enclosed white pixels to their corresponding determined fill color. White pixels not enclosed by any single shape remain white. Shape pixels remain unchanged.
