Grid Properties:
  - Size: Fixed at 10x10 in all examples.
  - Background Color: white (0).

Objects:
  - Input Shape: A configuration of pixels of a single non-background color (red, blue, gray). These shapes vary between examples.
  - Added Line: A line of green (3) pixels added in the output.

Relationships & Actions:
  - Preservation: The input shapes and background pixels are preserved in the output, unless overwritten by the added green line.
  - Line Insertion Condition: A green line is inserted based on the emptiness (containing only background color 0) of the central row or column.
  - Central Row Index: Calculated as `height // 2 - 1` (which is 4 for height 10).
  - Central Column Index: Calculated as `width // 2 - 1` (which is 4 for width 10).
  - Decision Logic:
    - If the central row in the input grid consists only of background pixels (0), the output grid will have this entire row filled with green (3).
    - Otherwise, if the central column in the input grid consists only of background pixels (0), the output grid will have this entire column filled with green (3).

Assumptions based on examples:
  - Only one line (either horizontal or vertical) is added.
  - The priority is to check the central row first, then the central column.
  - At least one of the central row or central column will be empty in the provided examples.
