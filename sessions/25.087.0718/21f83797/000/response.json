Specifically, horizontal lines are drawn at the rows of the input pixels, and vertical lines are drawn at the columns of the input pixels.\n    *   The rectangular area strictly *inside* this frame is filled with a different color (blue in the examples).\n    *   The corners where the frame lines intersect retain the frame color.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
