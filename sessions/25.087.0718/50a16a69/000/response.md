**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task takes an input grid and produces an output grid of the exact same dimensions.
2.  **Patterns:** The input grids contain distinct regions:
    *   A region with a repeating geometric color pattern (like a checkerboard or stripes/sequences). This pattern typically occupies a large portion of the grid.
    *   A border or fill region consisting of a single, uniform color (blue, azure, yellow in the examples) that is different from the colors used in the main pattern. This region might be a single row/column or a larger area.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves extending or tiling a pattern across the entire grid. The border/fill region from the input is completely replaced in the output.
4.  **Pattern Modification:** The pattern that fills the output grid is derived from the main pattern in the input grid. It appears to be the same type of repeating pattern but potentially shifted or starting with a different element/color compared to the input pattern's origin. Specifically, it looks like a horizontal cyclic shift of the input pattern.
5.  **Colors:** Various colors (red, gray, blue, magenta, green, orange, azure, yellow) are used. The specific colors define the patterns.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Replace a border/fill region in the input grid by tiling a modified version of the main input pattern across the entire output grid.
grid_properties:
  - input_output_shape_match: True
  - output_grid_dimensions: Same as input grid dimensions.
objects:
  - object_type: pattern_area
    description: A region in the input grid containing a repeating color pattern.
    properties:
      - colors: Multiple, depends on the specific pattern.
      - structure: Repeating tile (e.g., 2x2, 2x4, 2x3).
      - location: Usually occupies the majority of the grid, excluding the border/fill.
  - object_type: border_fill_area
    description: A region in the input grid with a single, uniform color, distinct from the pattern area colors.
    properties:
      - colors: Single color (e.g., blue, azure, yellow).
      - structure: Contiguous block, often along edges or filling remaining space.
      - location: Adjacent to the pattern area, often along one or more edges.
actions:
  - action: identify_pattern_tile
    description: Determine the basic repeating unit (tile) and its dimensions (tile_height, tile_width) from the pattern_area of the input grid.
    inputs:
      - pattern_area
    outputs:
      - input_tile: The smallest 2D array representing the repeating unit.
      - tile_height: The height of the input_tile.
      - tile_width: The width of the input_tile.
  - action: calculate_output_pixel_color
    description: Determine the color for each pixel in the output grid based on a transformation of the input_tile.
    inputs:
      - row_index (r)
      - column_index (c)
      - input_tile
      - tile_height
      - tile_width
    outputs:
      - pixel_color: The color for the output grid at (r, c).
    rule: The color is obtained from the input_tile at row `r % tile_height` and column `(c + 1) % tile_width`. This implements a horizontal cyclic shift of the pattern by one position to the left.
  - action: fill_output_grid
    description: Create the output grid and populate it cell by cell using the calculated_output_pixel_color rule.
    inputs:
      - grid_height
      - grid_width
      - calculate_output_pixel_color function
    outputs:
      - output_grid: The final transformed grid.
relationships:
  - The output grid pattern is a horizontally shifted version (by 1 position left, cyclically) of the input grid's main pattern.
  - The border_fill_area from the input is completely replaced by the tiled, shifted pattern in the output.
  - The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height `H` and width `W` of the input grid.
2.  Identify the main repeating pattern area within the input grid (ignoring any border/fill regions of a single, distinct color).
3.  Determine the smallest repeating unit (the basic tile) of this pattern. Record its height `th` and width `tw`. Extract this tile as `InputTile`.
4.  Create a new grid, `OutputGrid`, with dimensions `H` x `W`.
5.  For each cell in `OutputGrid` at position (row `r`, column `c`):
    a.  Calculate the corresponding row index within the tile: `tile_r = r % th`.
    b.  Calculate the corresponding column index within the tile, applying a horizontal shift: `tile_c = (c + 1) % tw`.
    c.  Set the color of `OutputGrid[r][c]` to the color found at `InputTile[tile_r][tile_c]`.
6.  Return the completed `OutputGrid`.
