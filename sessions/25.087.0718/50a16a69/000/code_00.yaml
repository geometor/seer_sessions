task_description: Replace a border/fill region in the input grid by tiling a modified version of the main input pattern across the entire output grid.
grid_properties:
  - input_output_shape_match: True
  - output_grid_dimensions: Same as input grid dimensions.
objects:
  - object_type: pattern_area
    description: A region in the input grid containing a repeating color pattern.
    properties:
      - colors: Multiple, depends on the specific pattern.
      - structure: Repeating tile (e.g., 2x2, 2x4, 2x3).
      - location: Usually occupies the majority of the grid, excluding the border/fill.
  - object_type: border_fill_area
    description: A region in the input grid with a single, uniform color, distinct from the pattern area colors.
    properties:
      - colors: Single color (e.g., blue, azure, yellow).
      - structure: Contiguous block, often along edges or filling remaining space.
      - location: Adjacent to the pattern area, often along one or more edges.
actions:
  - action: identify_pattern_tile
    description: Determine the basic repeating unit (tile) and its dimensions (tile_height, tile_width) from the pattern_area of the input grid.
    inputs:
      - pattern_area
    outputs:
      - input_tile: The smallest 2D array representing the repeating unit.
      - tile_height: The height of the input_tile.
      - tile_width: The width of the input_tile.
  - action: calculate_output_pixel_color
    description: Determine the color for each pixel in the output grid based on a transformation of the input_tile.
    inputs:
      - row_index (r)
      - column_index (c)
      - input_tile
      - tile_height
      - tile_width
    outputs:
      - pixel_color: The color for the output grid at (r, c).
    rule: The color is obtained from the input_tile at row `r % tile_height` and column `(c + 1) % tile_width`. This implements a horizontal cyclic shift of the pattern by one position to the left.
  - action: fill_output_grid
    description: Create the output grid and populate it cell by cell using the calculated_output_pixel_color rule.
    inputs:
      - grid_height
      - grid_width
      - calculate_output_pixel_color function
    outputs:
      - output_grid: The final transformed grid.
relationships:
  - The output grid pattern is a horizontally shifted version (by 1 position left, cyclically) of the input grid's main pattern.
  - The border_fill_area from the input is completely replaced by the tiled, shifted pattern in the output.
  - The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.
