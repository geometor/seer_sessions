            "text": "**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task takes an input grid and produces an output grid of the exact same dimensions.\n2.  **Patterns:** The input grids contain distinct regions:\n    *   A region with a repeating geometric color pattern (like a checkerboard or stripes/sequences). This pattern typically occupies a large portion of the grid.\n    *   A border or fill region consisting of a single, uniform color (blue, azure, yellow in the examples) that is different from the colors used in the main pattern. This region might be a single row/column or a larger area.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves extending or tiling a pattern across the entire grid. The border/fill region from the input is completely replaced in the output.\n4.  **Pattern Modification:** The pattern that fills the output grid is derived from the main pattern in the input grid. It appears to be the same type of repeating pattern but potentially shifted or starting with a different element/color compared to the input pattern's origin. Specifically, it looks like a horizontal cyclic shift of the input pattern.\n5.  **Colors:** Various colors (red, gray, blue, magenta, green, orange, azure, yellow) are used. The specific colors define the patterns.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
