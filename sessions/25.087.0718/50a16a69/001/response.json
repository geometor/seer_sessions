This pattern tile is then used to tile the entire output grid, which has the same dimensions as the input grid. Crucially, when tiling, the pattern is applied with a horizontal cyclic shift of one position to the left compared to how it would tile directly from the input tile.\n\n1. Determine the dimensions (H, W) of the input grid.\n2. Identify the dimensions (th, tw) of the basic repeating pattern tile starting from the top-left corner (0,0).\n   - Find the smallest height `th > 0` such that the row `th` starts repeating the pattern of row 0 (i.e., grid[th][0] == grid[0][0], grid[th][1] == grid[0][1], etc., as far as needed). Assume th = H if no repeat is found vertically within the grid bounds.\n   - Find the smallest width `tw > 0` such that the column `tw` starts repeating the pattern of column 0 (i.e., grid[0][tw] == grid[0][0], grid[1][tw] == grid[1][0], etc., as far as needed). Assume tw = W if no repeat is found horizontally.\n   - For this specific task's examples, a simpler check seems sufficient:\n     - Find smallest th > 0 where grid[th][0] == grid[0][0].\n     - Find smallest tw > 0 where grid[0][tw] == grid[0][0].\n3. Extract the identified pattern tile: `input_tile = input_grid[0:th, 0:tw]`.\n4. Create an output grid of the same dimensions (H, W).\n5. Fill the output grid: For each cell (r, c) in the output grid, the color is determined by the input tile at row `r % th` and column `(c + 1) % tw`. This implements the horizontal cyclic shift.\n6. Return the filled output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_pattern_tile_dims(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the dimensions of the repeating pattern tile starting at (0,0).\n    Assumes the pattern begins at (0,0) and finds the first repeat horizontally and vertically.\n    \"\"\"\n    H, W = grid.shape\n    \n    # Find tile height (th)\n    th = H  # Default to full height if no repeat found\n    if H > 1:\n        start_pixel_col0 = grid[0, 0]\n        for r in range(1, H):\n            if grid[r, 0] == start_pixel_col0:\n                # Basic check passed, potentially confirm with more columns if needed\n                # For simplicity based on examples, we'll assume this is sufficient.\n                th = r\n                break\n\n    # Find tile width (tw)\n    tw = W  # Default to full width if no repeat found\n    if W > 1:\n       start_pixel_row0 = grid[0, 0]\n       for c in range(1, W):\n            if grid[0, c] == start_pixel_row0:\n                # Basic check passed, potentially confirm with more rows if needed\n                # For simplicity based on examples, we'll assume this is sufficient.\n                tw = c\n                break\n                \n    # Handle cases where grid is 1xN or Nx1 or no repeat found\n    if th == 0: th = 1\n    if tw == 0: tw = 1\n        \n    return th, tw\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by identifying a repeating pattern tile,\n    and tiling the output grid with a horizontally shifted version of this pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    H, W = input_grid_np.shape\n\n    # 1.
