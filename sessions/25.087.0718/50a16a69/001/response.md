The transformation rule involves identifying a repeating pattern tile in the top-left corner of the input grid, ignoring any border or fill regions. This pattern tile is then used to tile the entire output grid, which has the same dimensions as the input grid. Crucially, when tiling, the pattern is applied with a horizontal cyclic shift of one position to the left compared to how it would tile directly from the input tile.

1. Determine the dimensions (H, W) of the input grid.
2. Identify the dimensions (th, tw) of the basic repeating pattern tile starting from the top-left corner (0,0).
   - Find the smallest height `th > 0` such that the row `th` starts repeating the pattern of row 0 (i.e., grid[th][0] == grid[0][0], grid[th][1] == grid[0][1], etc., as far as needed). Assume th = H if no repeat is found vertically within the grid bounds.
   - Find the smallest width `tw > 0` such that the column `tw` starts repeating the pattern of column 0 (i.e., grid[0][tw] == grid[0][0], grid[1][tw] == grid[1][0], etc., as far as needed). Assume tw = W if no repeat is found horizontally.
   - For this specific task's examples, a simpler check seems sufficient:
     - Find smallest th > 0 where grid[th][0] == grid[0][0].
     - Find smallest tw > 0 where grid[0][tw] == grid[0][0].
3. Extract the identified pattern tile: `input_tile = input_grid[0:th, 0:tw]`.
4. Create an output grid of the same dimensions (H, W).
5. Fill the output grid: For each cell (r, c) in the output grid, the color is determined by the input tile at row `r % th` and column `(c + 1) % tw`. This implements the horizontal cyclic shift.
6. Return the filled output grid.
