Transformation Rule:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous, non-white (0) objects in the input grid. For each object, record its color, pixel coordinates, bounding box (min/max row/col), height, width, and area (height * width). Use 4-way connectivity.
2.  **Filter Singletons:** Remove any objects with a bounding box area of 1 (single pixels) from the list.
3.  **Identify Frame Object:**
    *   Iterate through the remaining objects. Identify the unique object whose bounding box geometrically contains the bounding boxes of *all* other remaining objects. This is the 'Frame Object'.
    *   Record the frame object's color. Remove the frame object from the list of potential nested objects. (Assume exactly one such frame object exists).
4.  **Identify Nested Objects:** The remaining objects in the list are the 'Nested Objects'.
5.  **Sort Nested Objects:** Sort the nested objects by their bounding box area in ascending order (smallest area first).
6.  **Determine Output Size:**
    *   If the sorted list of nested objects is empty, the output is a 3x3 grid filled with the frame color.
    *   Otherwise, get the bounding box dimensions (height, width) of the *largest* area object in the sorted list.
    *   The output grid size is `(largest_height + 2)` x `(largest_width + 2)`.
7.  **Construct Output Grid:**
    *   Create an empty grid of the calculated output size, filled entirely with the frame color.
    *   Iterate through the sorted nested objects from *largest area* to *smallest area* (reverse order of the sorted list).
    *   For each object, retrieve its original pixel grid representation (`obj['grid']`) and bounding box dimensions (`obj_h`, `obj_w`).
    *   Calculate the top-left position `(start_row, start_col)` to center its bounding box within the output grid's inner area (excluding the 1-pixel border). Calculation: `start_row = (output_h - obj_h) // 2`, `start_col = (output_w - obj_w) // 2`.
    *   Place the object's pixels onto the output grid at `(start_row, start_col)`, overwriting existing pixels. Only copy non-zero pixels from the object's grid (`obj['grid']`).
8.  **Add Central Red Pixel (Conditional):**
    *   If nested objects were placed:
        *   Identify the innermost (smallest area) object from the sorted list.
        *   Get its bounding box dimensions (`inner_h`, `inner_w`).
        *   If *both* `inner_h` and `inner_w` are odd, calculate the absolute center coordinates of the *output grid*: `center_row = output_h // 2`, `center_col = output_w // 2`.
        *   Set the pixel at `(center_row, center_col)` to Red (2).

**Metric Analysis Interpretation:**

*   **Object Identification:** The `find_objects` function seems to identify multiple distinct objects even if they share the same color (e.g., the two Azure-8 objects in Example 1 and Example 2). This needs correction. Objects should be contiguous regions of the *same* color. Let's re-run the metric gathering with a corrected `find_objects` that merges adjacent components of the same color or only returns one object per color if that's the rule. Given the nested structure, it's more likely that components of the same color should be treated as one object if they are part of the visual hierarchy. *However*, looking closely at Example 1, the Azure-8 object *is* a single contiguous shape. The Red-2 object *is* a single contiguous shape. Green-3 is one shape. Yellow-4 is one shape. Wait, the code output shows two Azure-8 objects? Let me re-check the code. Ah, the `find_objects` code looks correct for 4-way connectivity. Why did it find two Azure-8 objects? Let's trace:
    *   Input 1: Azure at `(1,0)` connects to `(6,5)`. Another Azure at `(5,4)` connects to `(6,5)`. These should be *one* object. Why were they split? Is the `visited` logic flawed? No, `visited` looks standard. Is it the input grid visualization?
        
```
        8 8 8 8 8 8  <- Row 1
        8 . . . . 8
        8 . . . . 8
        8 . . 2 2 2 2 2
        8 . . 2 . 8  <- Row 5, Col 5
        8 8 8 2 8 8  <- Row 6, Col 4 & 5
        . . . 2 . .
        ```

        At `(5, 5)`, the color is 8. At `(6, 4)`, the color is 2. At `(6, 5)`, the color is 8. Ah, `(5,5)` and `(6,5)` are adjacent vertically. They should be part of the same Azure-8 object. The `find_objects` *should* have found only one Azure object. Let me re-examine the `find_objects` implementation details. The BFS seems correct. Maybe the `visited` array is being reset or mismanaged? No, it's created once. This is perplexing. Let's assume for now the object finder *should* find single objects per contiguous color block.
    *   Input 2: Similarly, two Azure-8 objects reported. Let's check:
        
```
        . 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 <- Row 7
        . 8 . . . . . 8 <- Row 8
        . 8 . . . 3 ...
        . 8 . . . 3 . 8 <- Row 10, Col 7
        . 8 . . . 3 . 8 <- Row 11, Col 7
        . 8 . . . 3 . 8 <- Row 12, Col 7
        . 8 8 8 8 3 8 8 <- Row 13, Col 6 & 7
        . . . . . 3 . .
        ```

        The Azure-8 at `(10, 7)`, `(11, 7)`, `(12, 7)` connect to `(13, 6)` and `(13, 7)`. These should also be part of the main Azure-8 object starting at `(7, 1)`.
    *   **Hypothesis:** There might be an issue in the `find_objects` implementation used for the metric gathering or the previous code run, causing fragmentation of single-color objects. Let's trust the visual representation and the expected outputs for the object definitions.

*   **Frame Identification:** Identifying the frame by the largest *bounding box area* seems correct based on the `identified_frame_color` matching the `expected_frame_color` (Red=2 for Ex1, Green=3 for Ex2) in the metric results (despite the object fragmentation issue potentially affecting area calculation slightly, the largest object remained correct). The reported areas (64 for Red in Ex1, 63 for Green in Ex2) are based on the *fragmented* objects, so the actual areas might differ, but the *largest* seems robustly identified.

*   **Nested Objects:** The number of *significant* objects found minus 1 (for the frame) should equal the expected nested objects.
    *   Ex1: 5 significant objects found. 5 - 1 = 4 nested objects. Expected: 3. This discrepancy is due to the fragmented Azure object. It should be: Red (frame), Azure, Green, Yellow (3 nested).
    *   Ex2: 5 significant objects found. 5 - 1 = 4 nested objects. Expected: 3. This discrepancy is also due to the fragmented Azure object. It should be: Green (frame), Azure, Yellow, Blue (3 nested).

*   **Innermost Object & Red Pixel:**
    *   Ex1: The code identified the *smaller fragment* of the Azure object (Area 4, H=2, W=2) as innermost. The *actual* innermost object should be Yellow (Area 4, H=2, W=2). Both have even dimensions, so `center_red_condition_met` is correctly False, matching `expected_center_red`.
    *   Ex2: The code identified the *smaller fragment* of the Azure object (Area 8, H=4, W=2) as innermost. The *actual* innermost object should be Blue (Area 9, H=3, W=3). The code calculated `center_red_condition_met` as False (because 4 and 2 are even). The expected is True (because 3 and 3 are odd). This difference arises directly from misidentifying the innermost object due to fragmentation.

*   **Output Size:** The rule is `(largest_nested_h + 2, largest_nested_w + 2)`.
    *   Ex1: Largest nested object *should be* Azure (H=6, W=6). Output size should be (6+2, 6+2) = (8, 8). This matches the expected output size.
    *   Ex2: Largest nested object *should be* Azure (H=7, W=7). Output size should be (7+2, 7+2) = (9, 9). This matches the expected output size.
    *   The previous code produced 3x3 outputs, indicating it likely entered the "no nested objects" fallback, probably due to the frame identification logic failure (`bbox_contains`).

**Refined Strategy:**
1.  Correct the `find_objects` function to ensure it correctly identifies single contiguous objects of the same color, even if complex shapes.
2.  Implement the frame identification based on the object with the largest bounding box area.
3.  Filter singletons (bbox_area=1).
4.  Identify nested objects as the remaining significant objects.
5.  Calculate output size based on the bounding box of the largest nested object.
6.  Implement the nesting logic (fill frame, place nested objects largest-to-smallest, centered).
7.  Implement the central red pixel logic based on the bounding box dimensions of the *smallest area* nested object.

---

## General Assessment

The previous code failed because its core logic for identifying the "frame" object was flawed. It assumed the frame's bounding box must geometrically contain all other objects' bounding boxes, which is not true in the provided examples. The code also appears to have issues correctly identifying contiguous objects of the same color, leading to fragmentation and incorrect identification of nested and innermost objects.

The strategy is to revise the object identification process and redefine the frame identification criterion. The frame appears to be the object with the largest bounding box area. Nested objects are all other significant (non-singleton) objects. The output construction logic (size determination, centered placement, conditional red pixel) seems mostly correct but depends on accurate object identification.

## Metrics Gathering

The `tool_code` execution provided detailed metrics based on the potentially flawed `find_objects` function. Key findings assuming corrected object identification:

**Example 1:**
*   Input: 13x13 grid.
*   Objects (Expected): Red (Frame, bbox ~8x8), Azure (Nested, bbox 6x6), Green (Nested, bbox 4x4), Yellow (Nested, bbox 2x2).
*   Frame: Red (color 2), largest bbox area.
*   Nested: Azure, Green, Yellow (3 objects).
*   Largest Nested: Azure (H=6, W=6).
*   Innermost Nested: Yellow (H=2, W=2).
*   Output Size: Expected (6+2, 6+2) = 8x8. Actual was 3x3.
*   Central Red Pixel: Innermost H/W (2, 2) are not both odd. Expected: No.

**Example 2:**
*   Input: 16x16 grid. Contains a singleton Red pixel likely to be ignored.
*   Objects (Expected): Green (Frame, bbox ~7x9), Azure (Nested, bbox 7x7), Yellow (Nested, bbox 5x5), Blue (Nested, bbox 3x3).
*   Frame: Green (color 3), largest bbox area.
*   Nested: Azure, Yellow, Blue (3 objects).
*   Largest Nested: Azure (H=7, W=7).
*   Innermost Nested: Blue (H=3, W=3).
*   Output Size: Expected (7+2, 7+2) = 9x9. Actual was 3x3.
*   Central Red Pixel: Innermost H/W (3, 3) are both odd. Expected: Yes.

**Discrepancy:** The code produced 3x3 outputs, indicating a failure in identifying nested objects correctly, likely stemming from the original frame identification logic (`bbox_contains`) rather than the revised largest area approach. The object fragmentation observed in the metrics further complicates analysis but highlights the need for robust object finding.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct contiguous regions of non-white pixels in the input grid using 4-way connectivity. For each object, determine its color, pixel coordinates, and bounding box (minimum/maximum row/column).
2.  **Filter Singletons:** Identify objects whose bounding box has an area of 1 (height=1 and width=1). Remove these singleton objects from further consideration.
3.  **Identify Frame:** Among the remaining significant objects, find the one with the largest bounding box area (height * width). This is the 'Frame Object'. Record its color ('frame_color').
4.  **Identify Nested Objects:** All significant objects that are *not* the Frame Object are considered 'Nested Objects'.
5.  **Determine Output Size:**
    *   If there are no Nested Objects, the output grid size is 3x3.
    *   If there are Nested Objects, sort them by bounding box area in ascending order. Find the Nested Object with the *largest* bounding box area. The output grid dimensions are (height of largest nested object + 2) x (width of largest nested object + 2).
6.  **Construct Output Grid:**
    *   Create a new grid with the determined output size, completely filled with the 'frame_color'.
    *   Sort the Nested Objects by bounding box area in *descending* order (largest area first).
    *   Iterate through the sorted Nested Objects:
        *   Extract the object's pixel representation relative to its own bounding box.
        *   Calculate the top-left row and column `(r, c)` needed to place the object's bounding box perfectly centered within the output grid, excluding the 1-pixel border. Center based on bounding box dimensions: `r = (output_height - object_height) // 2`, `c = (output_width - object_width) // 2`.
        *   Place the object's non-white pixels onto the output grid starting at `(r, c)`, overwriting any existing colors.
7.  **Add Central Red Pixel (Conditional):**
    *   Check if any Nested Objects were placed in step 6.
    *   If yes, identify the Nested Object with the *smallest* bounding box area (the 'innermost' object).
    *   Check if *both* the height and width of the innermost object's bounding box are odd numbers.
    *   If both are odd, calculate the absolute center coordinates of the output grid (`center_row = output_height // 2`, `center_col = output_width // 2`). Set the pixel at these coordinates to Red (color 2).
8.  **Return Output:** The final constructed grid is the result.## General Assessment

The provided code failed on the new examples because the logic for identifying the "frame" object was incorrect. The assumption that the frame object's bounding box must geometrically contain all other bounding boxes does not hold true for these examples. Furthermore, the analysis suggests a potential issue in the `find_objects` helper function used previously, as it seemed to incorrectly fragment single contiguous objects of the same color in the metric gathering step. The fallback mechanism (producing a 3x3 grid of the frame color when no nested objects are found) was likely triggered due to the incorrect frame/nesting identification.

The strategy is to:
1.  Ensure the object identification logic correctly finds single, contiguous objects for each color block.
2.  Redefine the "Frame Object" as the significant (non-singleton) object with the largest bounding box area.
3.  Define "Nested Objects" as all other significant objects.
4.  Refine the output construction based on this new definition, ensuring correct sizing based on the largest nested object and correct placement order (largest nested to smallest nested).
5.  Verify the conditional central red pixel logic uses the dimensions of the *smallest area* nested object.

## Metrics Gathering

Based on the `tool_code` output and subsequent analysis (correcting for potential object fragmentation):

**Example 1:**
*   **Input:** 13x13 grid.
*   **Objects (Significant, Expected):** Red (Frame, largest bbox area), Azure, Green, Yellow.
*   **Frame Color:** Red (2).
*   **Nested Objects (Expected):** Azure (bbox 6x6), Green (bbox 4x4), Yellow (bbox 2x2). Total: 3.
*   **Largest Nested:** Azure (H=6, W=6).
*   **Innermost Nested:** Yellow (H=2, W=2).
*   **Expected Output Size:** (6+2, 6+2) = 8x8.
*   **Expected Central Red:** No (Innermost dims 2, 2 are not both odd).
*   **Actual Output:** 3x3 grid of Red (2). Incorrect size and content.

**Example 2:**
*   **Input:** 16x16 grid (contains negligible singleton Red pixel).
*   **Objects (Significant, Expected):** Green (Frame, largest bbox area), Azure, Yellow, Blue.
*   **Frame Color:** Green (3).
*   **Nested Objects (Expected):** Azure (bbox 7x7), Yellow (bbox 5x5), Blue (bbox 3x3). Total: 3.
*   **Largest Nested:** Azure (H=7, W=7).
*   **Innermost Nested:** Blue (H=3, W=3).
*   **Expected Output Size:** (7+2, 7+2) = 9x9.
*   **Expected Central Red:** Yes (Innermost dims 3, 3 are both odd).
*   **Actual Output:** 3x3 grid of Green (3). Incorrect size and content.

**Conclusion:** The failures stem from incorrect frame/nested object identification in the previous code. The revised approach (frame = largest bbox area) aligns with the expected frame colors and the logic for output sizing and central pixel placement seems consistent with the expected outputs when applied to the correctly identified objects.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify and Filter Objects:**
    *   Find all contiguous blocks of same-colored, non-white pixels in the input grid (using 4-way adjacency). Record each block's color, pixels, and bounding box (height `H`, width `W`).
    *   Calculate the bounding box area (`A = H * W`) for each object.
    *   Discard any objects where `A = 1` (singletons). These are the "significant objects".

2.  **Determine Frame and Nested Objects:**
    *   If no significant objects remain, create a 3x3 grid filled with white (0) and stop.
    *   Among the significant objects, identify the one with the largest bounding box area (`A`). This is the "Frame Object". Store its color as `frame_color`.
    *   All other significant objects are "Nested Objects".

3.  **Determine Output Grid Size:**
    *   If there are no Nested Objects, the output grid size is 3x3.
    *   If there are Nested Objects, find the Nested Object with the largest bounding box area (`A_max_nested`). Let its dimensions be `H_max_nested` and `W_max_nested`. The output grid size is `(H_max_nested + 2) x (W_max_nested + 2)`.

4.  **Construct Initial Output Grid:**
    *   Create a new grid of the determined output size.
    *   Fill this grid entirely with the `frame_color`.

5.  **Place Nested Objects:**
    *   If there are Nested Objects:
        *   Sort the Nested Objects by their bounding box area `A` in descending order (largest area first).
        *   For each Nested Object in the sorted list (let its dimensions be `H_obj`, `W_obj`):
            *   Determine the top-left coordinates `(r, c)` to center its bounding box within the output grid's inner area (the area inside the 1-pixel frame border): `r = (output_height - H_obj) // 2`, `c = (output_width - W_obj) // 2`.
            *   Extract the object's pattern (the non-white pixels relative to its own bounding box).
            *   Copy this pattern onto the output grid starting at `(r, c)`, overwriting any pixels already there.

6.  **Add Optional Center Pixel:**
    *   If there are Nested Objects:
        *   Identify the Nested Object with the *smallest* bounding box area `A` (the "innermost" object). Let its dimensions be `H_inner`, `W_inner`.
        *   Check if *both* `H_inner` is odd and `W_inner` is odd.
        *   If true, calculate the exact center coordinates of the output grid: `center_r = output_height // 2`, `center_c = output_width // 2`. Set the pixel at `(center_r, center_c)` to Red (color 2).

7.  **Final Result:** The constructed grid is the final output.
