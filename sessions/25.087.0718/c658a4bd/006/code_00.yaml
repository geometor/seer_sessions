task_description: Create a framed, centered, nested representation of objects from the input grid.

definitions:
  object: A contiguous area of non-white pixels of the same color (using 4-way adjacency).
  singleton: An object whose bounding box area is 1x1.
  significant_object: An object that is not a singleton.
  frame_object: The significant object with the largest bounding box area.
  nested_objects: All significant objects excluding the frame_object.
  innermost_object: The nested_object with the smallest bounding box area.
  largest_nested_object: The nested_object with the largest bounding box area.

input_processing:
  - Find all objects in the input grid.
  - Filter out singleton objects.

frame_determination:
  - Identify the frame_object based on the largest bounding box area among significant_objects.
  - Record the frame_object's color (frame_color).

output_grid_construction:
  - If no nested_objects exist:
      - Output is a 3x3 grid filled with frame_color.
  - If nested_objects exist:
      - Determine output dimensions: (largest_nested_object.height + 2) x (largest_nested_object.width + 2).
      - Create the output grid filled with frame_color.
      - Sort nested_objects by bounding box area (descending: largest first).
      - For each nested_object in sorted order:
          - Calculate the top-left position to center the object's bounding box within the output grid's inner area (excluding the 1-pixel border).
          - Copy the object's non-white pixels onto the output grid at the calculated position, overwriting existing pixels.

center_pixel_modification:
  - If nested_objects exist:
      - Get the innermost_object (smallest area).
      - If the innermost_object's bounding box height AND width are both odd numbers:
          - Calculate the absolute center coordinates of the output grid.
          - Set the pixel at the center coordinates to Red (color 2).
