*   **Perception:**
    The task involves identifying distinct geometric shapes (objects) within the input grid, differentiating them based on their color and form. The input grid contains multiple such objects, often including shapes like 'U', 'H', 'L', and 'Cross', along with possibly some scattered pixels which seem irrelevant. The background is white (0) and should be ignored.

    The transformation reorganizes these shapes into a smaller output grid. A key observation is the concept of nesting â€“ shapes are placed concentrically inside one another. One specific object from the input seems to determine the color of a 1-pixel border or frame surrounding the nested structure in the output. The remaining objects are then sorted, likely by size, and placed inside this frame, with the smallest object at the very center.

    There are specific shape transformations noted: an 'L' shape in the input might become a filled square in the output if it's one of the nested objects (train\_1). The object determining the frame color (e.g., a 'Cross' in train\_1, an 'L' in train\_2) does not appear inside the frame; its color is solely used for the frame itself.

    Finally, a single pixel of a specific color (Red, color 2) appears in the center of the innermost object in train\_2's output, but not in train\_1. This suggests a conditional rule, possibly related to the properties (like symmetry or dimensions) of the innermost shape.

        steps:
          - Create empty grid of output_size.
          - Draw frame using frame_color.
          - Place objects from the sorted list concentrically, centered, largest first (outermost) down to smallest (innermost), using original colors and potentially transformed shapes.
      - action: add_central_pixel (conditional)
        input: output_grid, innermost_object
        output: modified output_grid
        condition: If the innermost_object has a unique center cell (e.g., odd dimensions).
        effect: Color the center cell Red (2).

    relationships:
      - nesting: Smaller objects are placed inside larger objects.
      - centering: Objects are centered within the object that contains them.
      - complexity_hierarchy: Shapes seem ranked by complexity (e.g., Cross > L > U/H) to determine the frame.
      - size_sorting: Nested objects are ordered based on their bounding box size.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all distinct, contiguous, non-white objects in the input grid, noting their color, shape, and bounding box.
    2.  Determine the object with the "most complex" shape (using a hierarchy where Cross > L > U/H).
    3.  The color of this most complex object will be used for the frame of the output grid. This object itself is not placed inside the frame.
    4.  Consider all other identified objects. If any of these objects has an 'L' shape, transform its shape into a filled square that fits within its original bounding box. Keep its original color.
    5.  Sort these remaining (and potentially shape-transformed) objects based on the size of their bounding boxes, from smallest to largest.
    6.  Calculate the dimensions of the output grid: take the dimensions of the largest object in the sorted list and add 2 (for a 1-pixel frame on all sides).
    7.  Create the output grid. Draw a 1-pixel frame around the border using the color identified in step 3.
    8.  Place the objects from the sorted list (from step 5) into the grid, starting with the largest and working down to the smallest. Each object should be centered within the available space inside the previously placed object (or the frame, for the largest object). Use the object's original color and its (potentially transformed) shape.
    9.  Examine the innermost object placed. If this object has dimensions such that it possesses a single, unambiguous center cell (e.g., its bounding box has odd width and odd height), color this center cell Red (color 2). Otherwise, leave the center as determined by the object's shape and color.
