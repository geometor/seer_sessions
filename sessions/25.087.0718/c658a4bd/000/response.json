            "text": "*   **Perception:**\n    The task involves identifying distinct geometric shapes (objects) within the input grid, differentiating them based on their color and form. The input grid contains multiple such objects, often including shapes like 'U', 'H', 'L', and 'Cross', along with possibly some scattered pixels which seem irrelevant. The background is white (0) and should be ignored.\n\n    The transformation reorganizes these shapes into a smaller output grid. A key observation is the concept of nesting \u2013 shapes are placed concentrically inside one another. One specific object from the input seems to determine the color of a 1-pixel border or frame surrounding the nested structure in the output. The remaining objects are then sorted, likely by size, and placed inside this frame, with the smallest object at the very center.\n\n    There are specific shape transformations noted: an 'L' shape in the input might become a filled square in the output if it's one of the nested objects (train\\_1). The object determining the frame color (e.g., a 'Cross' in train\\_1, an 'L' in train\\_2) does not appear inside the frame; its color is solely used for the frame itself.\n\n    Finally, a single pixel of a specific color (Red, color 2) appears in the center of the innermost object in train\\_2's output, but not in train\\_1. This suggests a conditional rule, possibly related to the properties (like symmetry or dimensions) of the innermost shape.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Draw a 1-pixel frame around the border using the color identified in step 3.\n    8.  Place the objects from the sorted list (from step 5) into the grid, starting with the largest and working down to the smallest. Each object should be centered within the available space inside the previously placed object (or the frame, for the largest object). Use the object's original color and its (potentially transformed) shape.\n    9.  Examine the innermost object placed. If this object has dimensions such that it possesses a single, unambiguous center cell (e.g., its bounding box has odd width and odd height), color this center cell Red (color 2).
