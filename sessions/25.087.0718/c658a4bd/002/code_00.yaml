# Analysis based on manual inspection and expected outputs,
# overriding the flawed code execution results for shape identification.

Example 1:
  Input Objects:
    - ID: 1, Color: 8 (Azure), Shape: U-shape, BBox: (1, 0, 6, 5), H: 6, W: 6, Area: 36
    - ID: 2, Color: 3 (Green), Shape: L-shape, BBox: (1, 8, 4, 11), H: 4, W: 4, Area: 16
    - ID: 3, Color: 2 (Red), Shape: Cross, BBox: (4, 3, 11, 10), H: 8, W: 8, Area: 64
    - ID: 4, Color: 8 (Azure), Shape: Rect (part of obj 1 visually), BBox: (5, 4, 6, 5), H: 2, W: 2, Area: 4 # Note: find_objects splits complex shapes
    - ID: 5, Color: 4 (Yellow), Shape: Rectangle, BBox: (9, 0, 10, 1), H: 2, W: 2, Area: 4
  Frame Object Selection:
    - Rule: Select the object identified as 'Cross'.
    - Selected: Object 3 (Red, 2)
  Nested Objects (Raw):
    - Object 1 (Azure, 8)
    - Object 2 (Green, 3)
    - Object 4 (Azure, 8) # Should likely be combined with Object 1
    - Object 5 (Yellow, 4)
  Transformations:
    - Target: L-shape objects among nested items.
    - Action: Fill the bounding box with the object's color.
    - Apply to: Object 2 (Green, 3) -> Becomes 4x4 filled green square.
  Nesting Order (Smallest to Largest Area):
    - Object 5 (Yellow, 4), Area 4
    - Object 4 (Azure, 8), Area 4 # This object seems problematic / part of another
    - Object 2 (Green, 3), Transformed Area 16
    - Object 1 (Azure, 8), Area 36
  Output Size Determination:
    - Largest Nested Object: Object 1 (Azure, 8), H: 6, W: 6
    - Rule: Largest Nested H+2, Largest Nested W+2
    - Output Size: 8x8
  Central Pixel:
    - Innermost Object: Object 5 (Yellow, 4), H: 2, W: 2
    - Condition: H is odd AND W is odd? No (2x2).
    - Result: No central red pixel.
  Expected Output Frame Color: 2 (Red)

Example 2:
  Input Objects:
    - ID: 1, Color: 4 (Yellow), Shape: U-shape, BBox: (1, 3, 5, 7), H: 5, W: 5, Area: 25
    - ID: 2, Color: 2 (Red), Shape: Pixel, BBox: (2, 0, 2, 0), H: 1, W: 1, Area: 1
    - ID: 3, Color: 1 (Blue), Shape: H-shape, BBox: (2, 10, 4, 12), H: 3, W: 3, Area: 9
    - ID: 4, Color: 8 (Azure), Shape: L-shape, BBox: (7, 1, 13, 7), H: 7, W: 7, Area: 49
    - ID: 5, Color: 3 (Green), Shape: Cross, BBox: (9, 5, 15, 13), H: 7, W: 9, Area: 63 # Note: BBox seems wider than visual cross? Check find_objects
    - ID: 6, Color: 8 (Azure), Shape: Rect (part of obj 4 visually), BBox: (10, 6, 13, 7), H: 4, W: 2, Area: 8 # Note: find_objects splits complex shapes
  Frame Object Selection:
    - Rule: Select the object identified as 'Cross'.
    - Selected: Object 5 (Green, 3)
  Nested Objects (Raw):
    - Object 1 (Yellow, 4)
    - Object 2 (Red, 2) # This single pixel seems to disappear in output
    - Object 3 (Blue, 1)
    - Object 4 (Azure, 8)
    - Object 6 (Azure, 8) # Should likely be combined with Object 4
  Transformations:
    - Target: L-shape objects among nested items.
    - Action: Fill the bounding box with the object's color.
    - Apply to: Object 4 (Azure, 8) -> Becomes 7x7 filled Azure square.
  Nesting Order (Smallest to Largest Area):
    - Object 2 (Red, 2), Area 1 # Ignored in output?
    - Object 6 (Azure, 8), Area 8 # Problematic object
    - Object 3 (Blue, 1), Area 9
    - Object 1 (Yellow, 4), Area 25
    - Object 4 (Azure, 8), Transformed Area 49
  Output Size Determination:
    - Largest Nested Object: Object 4 (Azure, 8), H: 7, W: 7
    - Rule: Largest Nested H+2, Largest Nested W+2
    - Output Size: 9x9
  Central Pixel:
    - Innermost Object: Object 3 (Blue, 1), H: 3, W: 3 # Assuming Red pixel is ignored
    - Condition: H is odd AND W is odd? Yes (3x3).
    - Result: Place Red (2) at center (4, 4) of 9x9 grid.
  Expected Output Frame Color: 3 (Green)

Discrepancies & Refinements Needed:
  - Shape Identification: `is_cross` and `is_l_shape` require significant improvement. Need robust identification based on geometry, not just heuristics used previously.
  - Object Splitting: `find_objects` sometimes splits visually single objects (like the Azure U/L shapes) if there are narrow connections. This needs to be handled, perhaps by merging objects of the same color with adjacent or overlapping bounding boxes post-detection, or by using a more sophisticated segmentation algorithm (like diagonal connectivity). For this task, we assume the main component found is representative.
  - Single Pixels: The single Red pixel in Ex2 is ignored in the output. Rule: Ignore objects with area 1 for nesting? Or maybe only specific colors? Needs clarification, but ignoring seems consistent.
  - Bounding Box for Cross: The bbox for the Green cross in Ex2 (7x9) seems wider than the visual cross. Ensure `find_objects` correctly calculates the minimal bbox.
