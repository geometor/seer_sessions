For each object, record its color, pixel coordinates, and bounding box.\n2.  **Classify & Prioritize:** Determine the shape type for each object (heuristically recognizing 'Cross', 'L', 'U'/'H', etc.). Assign a complexity score (e.g., Cross=3, L=2, U/H=1, Other=0).\n3.  **Select Frame Object:** Identify the object with the highest complexity score. Its color will be used for the output frame. Remove this object from further consideration for nesting.\n4.  **Prepare Nested Objects:** Take the remaining objects.\n5.  **Transform L-Shapes:** If any of the remaining objects is classified as an 'L' shape, transform it into a filled square of the same color, occupying its original bounding box dimensions.\n6.  **Sort by Size:** Sort these remaining (and potentially transformed) objects by the area of their bounding boxes in ascending order (smallest first).\n7.  **Determine Output Size:** Get the bounding box dimensions (height, width) of the largest object in the sorted list (the last one). The output grid size will be (height + 2) x (width + 2).\n8.  **Construct Output Grid:**\n    a.  Create an empty grid of the calculated output size, filled with the frame color (from step 3).\n    b.  Iterate through the sorted objects from largest to smallest (reverse order).\n    c.  For each object, calculate the top-left position to center it within the output grid's inner area (excluding the frame).\n    d.  Place the object's pixels (using its original color and potentially transformed shape) onto the output grid at the calculated position, overwriting the background frame color.\n9.  **Add Central Red Pixel (Conditional):**\n    a.  Identify the innermost (smallest) object placed.\n    b.  Check if its bounding box dimensions (height and width) are both odd.\n    c.  If both are odd, calculate the absolute center coordinates of the output grid `(output_height // 2, output_width // 2)`.\n    d.  Set the pixel at this central coordinate to Red (2).\n\"\"\"\n\n# Helper function to find connected components (objects)\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds all connected components of non-background pixels.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    \n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                points = set([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                min_r, max_r = r, r\n                min_c, max_c = c, c\n                \n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    min_r = min(min_r, row)\n                    max_r = max(max_r, row)\n                    min_c = min(min_c, col)\n                    max_c = max(max_c, col)\n                    \n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and \\\n                           not visited[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == color:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                            points.add((nr, nc))\n                            \n                bbox = (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)\n                obj_grid = extract_object_grid(grid, points, bbox)\n                objects.append({'color': color, 'points': points, 'bbox': bbox, 'grid': obj_grid})\n                \n    return objects\n\ndef extract_object_grid(grid, points, bbox):\n    \"\"\"Extracts the object's minimal grid representation.\"\"\"\n    min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c = bbox\n    height = max_r -
