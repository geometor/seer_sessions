The blue and red pixels appear to remain in their original locations relative to the grid boundaries.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the horizontal translation (shifting) of the entire gray vertical line to the right.\n4.  **Key Factors:** The amount the gray line shifts seems to be determined by some property of the input grid, likely related to the other colored pixels. Specifically, the number of blue pixels appears crucial.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Let this count be `N_blue`.\n3.  **Calculate** the horizontal shift amount (`S`) based on `N_blue`:\n    *   If `N_blue` is an even number, set `S = N_blue + 2`.\n    *   If `N_blue` is an odd number:\n        *   Check if `N_blue` is exactly 3. If it is, set `S = N_blue + 2`.\n        *   Otherwise (if `N_blue` is odd and not 3), set `S = N_blue + 1`.\n4.  **Determine** the target column index (`Col_out`) for the gray line in the output grid by adding the shift amount to the initial column index: `Col_out = Col_in + S`.\n5.  **Construct** the output grid:\n    *   Start with a copy of the input grid.\n    *   Remove the gray line from its original position at `Col_in` (change the pixels in that column back to the background color, 0, unless they were originally blue or red).\n    *   Draw the vertical gray line (color 5) in the calculated target column `Col_out`. Ensure that any original blue or red pixels that might exist at `Col_out` are preserved (i.e., the gray line only replaces background pixels in the target column). *Correction*: Based on the examples, the gray line overwrites *all* pixels in its target column. Let's refine Step 5.\n6.  **Construct** the output grid (Refined):\n    *   Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0).\n    *   Copy all blue (1) and red (2) pixels from the input grid to the new grid at their original coordinates.\n    *   Draw the vertical gray line (color 5) in the calculated target column `Col_out` in the new grid, overwriting any pixels previously placed there."
