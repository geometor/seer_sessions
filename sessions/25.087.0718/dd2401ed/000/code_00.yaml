Grid:
  - Background: Color 0 (white)
  - Objects:
      - Name: Gray_Line
        Color: 5 (gray)
        Shape: Vertical line spanning the grid height
        Quantity: 1
        Properties:
          - Column_Index_Input: The initial column index where the line resides.
          - Column_Index_Output: The final column index where the line resides after transformation.
      - Name: Blue_Pixels
        Color: 1 (blue)
        Shape: Single pixels
        Quantity: Variable (N_blue)
        Distribution: Scattered
        Properties:
          - Count: Total number of blue pixels in the grid.
          - Parity: Whether the count is even or odd.
      - Name: Red_Pixels
        Color: 2 (red)
        Shape: Single pixels
        Quantity: Variable
        Distribution: Scattered
        Role: Appear stationary; do not directly influence the gray line's movement.
Action:
  - Name: Translate_Column
    Object: Gray_Line
    Direction: Horizontal (Right)
    Amount: Shift (S)
Relationship:
  - Rule: The shift amount (S) is calculated based on the count of blue pixels (N_blue).
    Condition_1: If N_blue is even, then S = N_blue + 2.
    Condition_2: If N_blue is odd:
      Sub_Condition_A: If N_blue equals 3, then S = N_blue + 2.
      Sub_Condition_B: If N_blue is odd but not equal to 3, then S = N_blue + 1.
  - Final_Position: Column_Index_Output = Column_Index_Input + S
  - Invariance: The positions of Blue_Pixels and Red_Pixels relative to the grid boundaries remain unchanged.
