Transformation Rule Description:

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the column index (`Col_in`) of the vertical gray line (color 5) in the input grid.
3.  Count the total number of blue pixels (`N_blue`, color 1) in the input grid.
4.  Calculate the horizontal shift amount (`S`) for the gray line:
    *   If `N_blue` is even, `S = N_blue + 2`.
    *   If `N_blue` is odd and equals 3, `S = N_blue + 2`.
    *   If `N_blue` is odd and not equal to 3, `S = N_blue + 1`.
5.  Calculate the target column index (`Col_out`) for the gray line in the output grid: `Col_out = Col_in + S`.
6.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at position (row `r`, column `c`) with color `input_color`:
    *   If `input_color` is blue (1), set the output grid pixel at (r, c) to blue (1).
    *   If `input_color` is red (2):
        *   Check if `N_blue` is odd.
            *   If `N_blue` is odd *and* the column `c` is less than `Col_out`, set the output grid pixel at (r, c) to blue (1).
            *   Otherwise (if `N_blue` is even, *or* if `N_blue` is odd and `c >= Col_out`), set the output grid pixel at (r, c) to red (2).
    *   Ignore background pixels (0) and original gray line pixels (5) during this step.
7.  Draw the vertical gray line (color 5) in the output grid at column `Col_out`, overwriting any pixels currently in that column. Ensure `Col_out` is within the grid boundaries.
