Transformation Rule Description:

1.  Identify the vertical gray line (color 5) in the input grid and determine its column index (`Col_in`).
2.  Count the total number of blue pixels (color 1) present in the input grid (`N_blue`).
3.  Calculate the horizontal shift amount (`S`) for the gray line based on `N_blue`:
    *   If `N_blue` is even, `S = N_blue + 2`.
    *   If `N_blue` is odd and equal to 3, `S = N_blue + 2`.
    *   If `N_blue` is odd and not equal to 3, `S = N_blue + 1`.
4.  Determine the target column index (`Col_out`) for the gray line in the output grid: `Col_out = Col_in + S`.
5.  Construct the output grid:
    *   Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0).
    *   Copy non-gray, non-background pixels from the input to the output grid, applying a color transformation rule:
        *   If an input pixel is blue (1), copy it as blue (1) to the output grid at the same location.
        *   If an input pixel is red (2):
            *   If its column index `c` is less than the calculated target column index `Col_out`, change its color to blue (1) in the output grid.
            *   If its column index `c` is greater than or equal to `Col_out`, copy it as red (2) to the output grid.
    *   Finally, draw the vertical gray line (color 5) in the output grid at column `Col_out`, overwriting any pixels previously placed in that column.

**General Assessment**

The previous code successfully implemented parts of the transformation logic, accurately identifying the initial gray line, counting blue pixels, and calculating the shift amount for the gray line based on the blue pixel count. It correctly applied this shift in all four examples.

The failure occurred in Example 4, specifically regarding the rule for transforming red pixels (color 2). The initial rule stated that any red pixel with a column index less than the *new* gray line's column index (`Col_out`) should turn blue (color 1). This rule held for the first three examples where the number of blue pixels (`N_blue`) was odd. However, in Example 4, where `N_blue` was even, the expected output showed that *no* red pixels changed color, contradicting the initial rule.

The strategy is to refine the transformation rule for red pixels, making it conditional on the parity of `N_blue`. The updated rule should state that red pixels only change to blue if `N_blue` is odd *and* their column index `c` is less than `Col_out`. If `N_blue` is even, red pixels remain red regardless of their position relative to the new gray line.

**Metrics**

The following metrics were calculated for each example to verify the core logic components:

*   `Col_in`: The column index of the vertical gray line in the input grid.
*   `N_blue`: The total count of blue pixels (color 1) in the input grid.
*   `Shift`: The calculated horizontal shift for the gray line.
*   `Col_out`: The target column index for the gray line in the output grid (`Col_in + Shift`).

**Facts**


```yaml
Input Grid:
  Objects:
    - Type: Vertical Line
      Color: gray (5)
      Properties: Exactly one per grid, spans full height.
      Name: Gray Line
    - Type: Pixel Set
      Color: blue (1)
      Properties: Variable number, scattered positions.
      Name: Blue Pixels
    - Type: Pixel Set
      Color: red (2)
      Properties: Variable number, scattered positions.
      Name: Red Pixels
    - Type: Background
      Color: white (0)

Output Grid:
  Dimensions: Same as input grid.
  Objects:
    - Type: Vertical Line
      Color: gray (5)
      Properties: Position shifted horizontally compared to input.
      Name: Shifted Gray Line
    - Type: Pixel Set
      Color: blue (1)
      Properties: Includes original blue pixels and potentially some original red pixels that changed color.
      Name: Output Blue Pixels
    - Type: Pixel Set
      Color: red (2)
      Properties: Includes original red pixels that did not change color.
      Name: Output Red Pixels
    - Type: Background
      Color: white (0)

Actions & Transformations:
  - Identify: Locate the column index (`Col_in`) of the Gray Line in the input grid.
  - Count: Determine the total number (`N_blue`) of Blue Pixels in the input grid.
  - Calculate Shift (`S`):
    - If `N_blue` is even, `S = N_blue + 2`.
    - If `N_blue` is odd:
        - If `N_blue == 3`, `S = N_blue + 2`.
        - Otherwise (`N_blue` is odd and != 3), `S = N_blue + 1`.
  - Calculate Target Column (`Col_out`): `Col_out = Col_in + S`.
  - Create Output Grid: Initialize with Background color.
  - Copy Blue Pixels: All Blue Pixels from input are copied to the same positions in the output.
  - Transform Red Pixels:
    - Check if `N_blue` is odd.
      - If odd: For each Red Pixel in the input at position (r, c):
          - If its column `c` is less than `Col_out`, place a blue pixel (1) at (r, c) in the output.
          - Otherwise (if `c >= Col_out`), place a red pixel (2) at (r, c) in the output.
      - If even: For each Red Pixel in the input at position (r, c), place a red pixel (2) at (r, c) in the output (no color change occurs).
  - Draw Shifted Gray Line: Place gray pixels (5) in the entire column `Col_out` of the output grid, overwriting any pixels previously placed there.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the column index (`Col_in`) of the vertical gray line (color 5) in the input grid.
3.  Count the total number of blue pixels (`N_blue`, color 1) in the input grid.
4.  Calculate the horizontal shift amount (`S`) for the gray line:
    *   If `N_blue` is even, `S = N_blue + 2`.
    *   If `N_blue` is odd and equals 3, `S = N_blue + 2`.
    *   If `N_blue` is odd and not equal to 3, `S = N_blue + 1`.
5.  Calculate the target column index (`Col_out`) for the gray line in the output grid: `Col_out = Col_in + S`.
6.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at position (row `r`, column `c`) with color `input_color`:
    *   If `input_color` is blue (1), set the output grid pixel at (r, c) to blue (1).
    *   If `input_color` is red (2):
        *   Check if `N_blue` is odd.
            *   If `N_blue` is odd *and* the column `c` is less than `Col_out`, set the output grid pixel at (r, c) to blue (1).
            *   Otherwise (if `N_blue` is even, *or* if `N_blue` is odd and `c >= Col_out`), set the output grid pixel at (r, c) to red (2).
    *   Ignore background pixels (0) and original gray line pixels (5) during this step.
7.  Draw the vertical gray line (color 5) in the output grid at column `Col_out`, overwriting any pixels currently in that column. Ensure `Col_out` is within the grid boundaries.
