Input Grid:
  Objects:
    - Type: Vertical Line
      Color: gray (5)
      Properties: Exactly one per grid, spans full height.
      Name: Gray Line
    - Type: Pixel Set
      Color: blue (1)
      Properties: Variable number, scattered positions.
      Name: Blue Pixels
    - Type: Pixel Set
      Color: red (2)
      Properties: Variable number, scattered positions.
      Name: Red Pixels
    - Type: Background
      Color: white (0)

Output Grid:
  Dimensions: Same as input grid.
  Objects:
    - Type: Vertical Line
      Color: gray (5)
      Properties: Position shifted horizontally compared to input.
      Name: Shifted Gray Line
    - Type: Pixel Set
      Color: blue (1)
      Properties: Includes original blue pixels and potentially some original red pixels that changed color.
      Name: Output Blue Pixels
    - Type: Pixel Set
      Color: red (2)
      Properties: Includes original red pixels that did not change color.
      Name: Output Red Pixels
    - Type: Background
      Color: white (0)

Actions & Transformations:
  - Identify: Locate the column index (`Col_in`) of the Gray Line in the input grid.
  - Count: Determine the total number (`N_blue`) of Blue Pixels in the input grid.
  - Calculate Shift (`S`):
    - If `N_blue` is even, `S = N_blue + 2`.
    - If `N_blue` is odd:
        - If `N_blue == 3`, `S = N_blue + 2`.
        - Otherwise (`N_blue` is odd and != 3), `S = N_blue + 1`.
  - Calculate Target Column (`Col_out`): `Col_out = Col_in + S`.
  - Create Output Grid: Initialize with Background color.
  - Copy Blue Pixels: All Blue Pixels from input are copied to the same positions in the output.
  - Transform Red Pixels:
    - Check if `N_blue` is odd.
      - If odd: For each Red Pixel in the input at position (r, c):
          - If its column `c` is less than `Col_out`, place a blue pixel (1) at (r, c) in the output.
          - Otherwise (if `c >= Col_out`), place a red pixel (2) at (r, c) in the output.
      - If even: For each Red Pixel in the input at position (r, c), place a red pixel (2) at (r, c) in the output (no color change occurs).
  - Draw Shifted Gray Line: Place gray pixels (5) in the entire column `Col_out` of the output grid, overwriting any pixels previously placed there.
