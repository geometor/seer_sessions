Identify the vertical gray line (color 5) in the input grid and determine its column index (`Col_in`).\n2.  Count the total number of blue pixels (color 1) present in the input grid (`N_blue`).\n3.  Calculate the horizontal shift amount (`S`) for the gray line based on `N_blue`:\n    *   If `N_blue` is even, `S = N_blue + 2`.\n    *   If `N_blue` is odd and equal to 3, `S = N_blue + 2`.\n    *   If `N_blue` is odd and not equal to 3, `S = N_blue + 1`.\n4.  Determine the target column index (`Col_out`) for the gray line in the output grid: `Col_out = Col_in + S`.\n5.  Construct the output grid:\n    *   Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0).\n    *   Copy non-gray, non-background pixels from the input to the output grid, applying a color transformation rule:\n        *   If an input pixel is blue (1), copy it as blue (1) to the output grid at the same location.\n        *   If an input pixel is red (2):\n            *   If its column index `c` is less than the calculated target column index `Col_out`, change its color to blue (1) in the output grid.\n            *   If its column index `c` is greater than or equal to `Col_out`, copy it as red (2) to the output grid.\n    *   Finally, draw the vertical gray line (color 5) in the output grid at column `Col_out`, overwriting any pixels previously placed in that column.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_gray_line_col(grid: np.ndarray) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Finds the column index of the first occurrence of the gray color (5).\"\"\"\n    # Check columns for the gray color 5\n    # Assuming the gray line is solid and vertical, finding the first instance is sufficient\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for c in range(cols):\n        if grid[0, c] == 5:  # Check the first row for efficiency\n             # Verify it's a line (optional, but good practice)\n             is_line = True\n             for r in range(rows):\n                 if grid[r, c] != 5:\n                     is_line = False\n                     break\n             if is_line:\n                 return c\n    # Fallback if not found in first row or not a full line starting from row 0\n    # (Could happen if line starts lower, though not seen in examples)\n    gray_cols = np.where(grid == 5)[1]\n    if len(gray_cols) > 0:\n        return gray_cols[0] # Return the first column index where 5 appears\n    raise ValueError(\"Gray line (color 5) not found in the input grid.\")\n\ndef count_color(grid: np.ndarray, color: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of pixels of a specific color in the grid.\"\"\"\n    return np.count_nonzero(grid == color)\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    Shifts the gray line based on the blue pixel count and modifies red pixel colors\n    based on their position relative to the new gray line column.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to numpy array for efficient processing\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n\n    # 1.
