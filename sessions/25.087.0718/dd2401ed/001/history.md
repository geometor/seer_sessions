Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain a white background (0), a single vertical gray line (5), and scattered individual blue (1) and red (2) pixels.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are very similar to the inputs, with the primary difference being the horizontal position of the vertical gray line. The blue and red pixels appear to remain in their original locations relative to the grid boundaries.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the horizontal translation (shifting) of the entire gray vertical line to the right.
4.  **Key Factors:** The amount the gray line shifts seems to be determined by some property of the input grid, likely related to the other colored pixels. Specifically, the number of blue pixels appears crucial.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Grid:
  - Background: Color 0 (white)
  - Objects:
      - Name: Gray_Line
        Color: 5 (gray)
        Shape: Vertical line spanning the grid height
        Quantity: 1
        Properties:
          - Column_Index_Input: The initial column index where the line resides.
          - Column_Index_Output: The final column index where the line resides after transformation.
      - Name: Blue_Pixels
        Color: 1 (blue)
        Shape: Single pixels
        Quantity: Variable (N_blue)
        Distribution: Scattered
        Properties:
          - Count: Total number of blue pixels in the grid.
          - Parity: Whether the count is even or odd.
      - Name: Red_Pixels
        Color: 2 (red)
        Shape: Single pixels
        Quantity: Variable
        Distribution: Scattered
        Role: Appear stationary; do not directly influence the gray line's movement.
Action:
  - Name: Translate_Column
    Object: Gray_Line
    Direction: Horizontal (Right)
    Amount: Shift (S)
Relationship:
  - Rule: The shift amount (S) is calculated based on the count of blue pixels (N_blue).
    Condition_1: If N_blue is even, then S = N_blue + 2.
    Condition_2: If N_blue is odd:
      Sub_Condition_A: If N_blue equals 3, then S = N_blue + 2.
      Sub_Condition_B: If N_blue is odd but not equal to 3, then S = N_blue + 1.
  - Final_Position: Column_Index_Output = Column_Index_Input + S
  - Invariance: The positions of Blue_Pixels and Red_Pixels relative to the grid boundaries remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the vertical gray line (color 5) in the input grid and determine its column index (`Col_in`).
2.  **Count** the total number of blue pixels (color 1) present in the input grid. Let this count be `N_blue`.
3.  **Calculate** the horizontal shift amount (`S`) based on `N_blue`:
    *   If `N_blue` is an even number, set `S = N_blue + 2`.
    *   If `N_blue` is an odd number:
        *   Check if `N_blue` is exactly 3. If it is, set `S = N_blue + 2`.
        *   Otherwise (if `N_blue` is odd and not 3), set `S = N_blue + 1`.
4.  **Determine** the target column index (`Col_out`) for the gray line in the output grid by adding the shift amount to the initial column index: `Col_out = Col_in + S`.
5.  **Construct** the output grid:
    *   Start with a copy of the input grid.
    *   Remove the gray line from its original position at `Col_in` (change the pixels in that column back to the background color, 0, unless they were originally blue or red).
    *   Draw the vertical gray line (color 5) in the calculated target column `Col_out`. Ensure that any original blue or red pixels that might exist at `Col_out` are preserved (i.e., the gray line only replaces background pixels in the target column). *Correction*: Based on the examples, the gray line overwrites *all* pixels in its target column. Let's refine Step 5.
6.  **Construct** the output grid (Refined):
    *   Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0).
    *   Copy all blue (1) and red (2) pixels from the input grid to the new grid at their original coordinates.
    *   Draw the vertical gray line (color 5) in the calculated target column `Col_out` in the new grid, overwriting any pixels previously placed there.
