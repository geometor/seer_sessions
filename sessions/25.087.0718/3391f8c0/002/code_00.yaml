task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    - Background color is white (0) and remains unchanged.
    - Exactly two non-white colors are present in the input grid.
  object_definition:
    - An object is a contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color.
    - Contiguity includes adjacent pixels (sharing a side), potentially diagonals as well (need to confirm, but side-adjacency seems sufficient based on examples).
  transformation:
    - Identify the two non-white colors (Color A, Color B).
    - Identify all distinct objects made of Color A.
    - Identify all distinct objects made of Color B.
    - The transformation swaps the color identity of these objects.
  output_generation:
    - Create an output grid initialized with the background color (white).
    - For each object identified in the input:
      - If the object was made of Color A, draw the identical object shape using Color B at the same position in the output grid.
      - If the object was made of Color B, draw the identical object shape using Color A at the same position in the output grid.
    - The structure, size, and location of each object are preserved; only its color changes according to the swap rule.
