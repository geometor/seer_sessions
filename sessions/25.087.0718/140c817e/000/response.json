            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation for this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** The input grid consists primarily of a single background color (azure=8, maroon=9, or orange=7). Scattered within this background are a few isolated pixels of blue (1). These blue pixels appear as distinct points.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid retains the same dimensions and background color as the input. The key changes occur around the locations of the original blue pixels.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** For each original blue pixel in the input:\n    *   A horizontal line of blue (1) is drawn across the entire width of the grid at the row of the original blue pixel.\n    *   A vertical line of blue (1) is drawn across the entire height of the grid at the column of the original blue pixel.\n    *   The original blue pixel's location is replaced with a red pixel (2).\n    *   The four diagonally adjacent pixels to the red pixel are changed to green (3).\n4.  **Overlapping:** When lines or patterns from different source pixels overlap:\n    *   Intersections of horizontal and vertical blue lines remain blue (1).\n    *   The red (2) center pixel overwrites any blue line passing through it.\n    *   The green (3) diagonal pixels overwrite any blue line passing through them. This suggests the red and green pixels are applied *after* the blue lines are drawn.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
