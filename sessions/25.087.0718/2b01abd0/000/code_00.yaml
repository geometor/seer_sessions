facts:
  - id: blue_line
    type: object
    description: A contiguous straight line of blue (1) pixels.
    properties:
      - orientation: Either horizontal or vertical.
      - role: Acts as the axis of reflection.

  - id: source_object
    type: object
    description: A contiguous or non-contiguous group of pixels with colors other than white (0) or blue (1).
    properties:
      - location: Situated entirely on one side of the blue_line.
      - colors: Composed of pairs like (red/green), (azure/yellow), or (gray/magenta).

  - id: reflection_action
    type: action
    description: Mirroring the source_object across the blue_line.
    parameters:
      - object: source_object
      - axis: blue_line
    results:
      - Creates a reflected_object on the opposite side of the blue_line.
      - Preserves the perpendicular distance from the blue_line for each pixel.

  - id: color_swap_action
    type: action
    description: Modifying the colors of the pixels during the reflection_action.
    conditions: Applies only to the pixels of the reflected_object.
    rules:
      - if color is red (2), change to green (3).
      - if color is green (3), change to red (2).
      - if color is azure (8), change to yellow (4).
      - if color is yellow (4), change to azure (8).
      - if color is gray (5), change to magenta (6).
      - if color is magenta (6), change to gray (5).

  - id: output_grid_composition
    type: relationship
    description: The final output grid contains the original input grid elements plus the newly created reflected_object with swapped colors.
    components:
      - original_input_grid_pixels
      - reflected_object_pixels (with swapped colors)
