            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying a blue reflection axis and then reflecting non-white, non-blue pixels across this axis while swapping their colors according to specific pairs (Red<->Green, Azure<->Yellow, Gray<->Magenta).\n\nHowever, the comparison between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` for all three training examples reveals a consistent error pattern. The code correctly identified the reflection axis, calculated the reflected coordinates, and performed the color swaps. The mistake lies in *where* the swapped and original colors are placed in the output grid.\n\n- The **previous code** placed the *swapped* color at the *reflected* coordinates and left the *original* pixel *unchanged*.\n- The **expected output** shows that the *swapped* color should be placed at the *original* pixel's coordinates, and the *original* color should be placed at the *reflected* coordinates.\n\nTherefore, the core logic needs adjustment. The transformation involves both modifying the original pixel and placing a new pixel at the reflected location.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's confirm the number of source pixels and the number of pixels that differ between the Transformed Output (from the previous code) and the Expected Output.\n\n"
