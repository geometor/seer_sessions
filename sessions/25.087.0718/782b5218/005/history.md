The transformation process determines the output grid based on the following prioritized rules, using red (2) as the key color and white (0) as the background color:

1.  **Solid Row Separation Rule:** First, check if the input grid contains a horizontal row composed entirely of the key color (red). If such a row exists, *and* if the grid contains exactly three distinct colors in total (background, key color, and one other 'third color'), then apply this rule. Create a new grid of the same size. Fill all rows above the solid red row with the background color (white). Keep the solid red row itself red. Fill all rows below the solid red row with the 'third color'.

2.  **Fixed Diagonal Pattern Rule:** If the Solid Row Separation Rule does not apply, check two conditions: (a) Does the input grid contain exactly three distinct colors (background, key color, and a 'third color')? (b) Do *all* pixels matching the key color (red) in the input grid satisfy the positional requirement `row_index = column_index + 1` or `row_index = column_index + 2`? If *both* conditions are true, apply this rule. Create a new grid of the same size. Fill this grid with a fixed pattern: pixels where `row < column + 1` become background color (white), pixels where `row == column + 1` or `row == column + 2` become key color (red), and pixels where `row > column + 2` become the 'third color'.

3.  **Column Filter Rule:** If neither the Solid Row Separation Rule nor the Fixed Diagonal Pattern Rule applies, use this default rule. Create a new grid initially as a copy of the input grid. Then, for each column independently: find the uppermost (minimum row index) pixel that has the key color (red). If such a pixel exists in the column, change the color of all pixels *above* it in that same column to the background color (white). Pixels at or below the uppermost red pixel, and all pixels in columns containing no red pixels, remain unchanged from the input grid.

The metrics confirm the analysis:
*   Example 1: 3 unique colors (0, 2, 5), no solid red row, red pixels are NOT all on the specified diagonals. Code applies Rule 3.
*   Example 2: 3 unique colors (0, 1, 2), solid red row at index 3. Code applies Rule 1.
*   Example 3: 3 unique colors (0, 2, 8), no solid red row, red pixels ARE all on the specified diagonals. Code applies Rule 2.

The problem lies solely in the *implementation* of Rule 3 within the `apply_column_filter` function. The conditions for applying the rules seem correct.

**Final Plan:**
1.  Acknowledge the previous code's success on Examples 2 & 3 and failure on Example 1.
2.  State the strategy: refine the implementation of Rule 3 based on the observed pattern in Example 1's expected output.
3.  Provide the metrics gathered.
4.  Create the YAML facts document.
5.  Write the refined natural language program, specifically updating the description of Rule 3 to include the downward propagation logic.## General Assessment

The provided Python code successfully solves Examples 2 and 3 but fails on Example 1.
- Example 2 correctly triggers Rule 1 (Solid Row Separation).
- Example 3 correctly triggers Rule 2 (Fixed Diagonal Pattern Generation).
- Example 1 triggers Rule 3 (Column Filter) as expected by the conditional logic, but the *implementation* of Rule 3 does not produce the correct output for this example.

The strategy is to refine the description and implementation of Rule 3 based on the correct input-output pair for Example 1, while ensuring the logic for Rules 1 and 2 remains unchanged. The core issue appears to be how Rule 3 handles pixels at and below the topmost red pixel in each column. The expected output for Example 1 suggests a downward propagation of non-background colors below the initial red pixel, filling in any background cells encountered.

## Facts


```yaml
Task:
  Description: Apply one of three prioritized rules based on grid properties involving the color red (2) and the background color white (0).
  Key_Color: 2 (Red)
  Background_Color: 0 (White)

Rules:
  - Rule_Name: Solid Row Separation (Priority 1)
    Conditions:
      - Input grid contains exactly 3 unique colors.
      - Input grid contains at least one horizontal row composed entirely of the Key_Color (Red).
    Action:
      - Create a new grid of the same size.
      - Identify the 'third color' (the one that is not Background or Key_Color).
      - Identify the index `sr` of the first (topmost) solid Key_Color row.
      - Fill rows 0 to `sr-1` with Background_Color (White).
      - Fill row `sr` with Key_Color (Red).
      - Fill rows `sr+1` to end with the 'third color'.

  - Rule_Name: Fixed Diagonal Pattern (Priority 2)
    Conditions:
      - Rule 1 conditions are NOT met.
      - Input grid contains exactly 3 unique colors.
      - ALL pixels of the Key_Color (Red) in the input grid are located at positions `(r, c)` where `r = c + 1` OR `r = c + 2`.
    Action:
      - Create a new grid of the same size.
      - Identify the 'third color'.
      - Fill pixels based on position relative to the diagonal band `r=c+1` and `r=c+2`:
        - `r < c + 1`: Fill with Background_Color (White).
        - `r == c + 1` or `r == c + 2`: Fill with Key_Color (Red).
        - `r > c + 2`: Fill with the 'third color'.

  - Rule_Name: Column Filter with Downward Propagation (Priority 3 / Default)
    Conditions:
      - Neither Rule 1 nor Rule 2 conditions are met.
    Action:
      - Create a new grid, initially a copy of the input grid.
      - Process each column independently:
        - Find the row index `mr` of the topmost (minimum row index) Key_Color (Red) pixel in the column.
        - If no Key_Color pixel exists in the column, the column remains unchanged.
        - If a Key_Color pixel exists at `mr`:
          - Change all pixels in that column in rows `0` to `mr-1` to Background_Color (White).
          - Keep the pixel at `(mr, col)` as Key_Color (Red).
          - For rows `r` from `mr + 1` down to the bottom of the grid:
            - If the pixel at `(r, col)` in the *current output grid state* is Background_Color (White), change it to the color of the pixel directly above it at `(r-1, col)` in the *output grid*. (Effectively propagating the color from `(mr, col)` downwards through any background cells).
            - Otherwise (if the pixel is not Background_Color), leave it unchanged.

Grid_Properties:
  - Size: Height and Width (variable, up to 30x30).
  - Pixels: Cells containing integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - Objects: Contiguous blocks of same-colored pixels can be considered objects. Specific objects identified are horizontal rows and diagonal bands.

Colors:
  - Involved: White (0), Red (2), and potentially one other 'third color' depending on the rule. Examples show Blue (1), Gray (5), Azure (8) as third colors.

## Natural Language Program

The transformation determines the output grid by applying the first matching rule from the following prioritized list, using red (2) as the key color and white (0) as the background color:

1.  **Solid Row Separation Rule:** Check if the input grid contains exactly three unique colors AND if it has a horizontal row composed entirely of the key color (red). If both conditions are true:
    *   Identify the 'third color' (neither white nor red).
    *   Find the row index (`sr`) of the topmost solid red row.
    *   Create the output grid by filling rows above `sr` with white, row `sr` with red, and rows below `sr` with the 'third color'.

2.  **Fixed Diagonal Pattern Rule:** If Rule 1 does not apply, check if the input grid contains exactly three unique colors AND if *all* red pixels are located at positions `(r, c)` where `r = c + 1` or `r = c + 2`. If both conditions are true:
    *   Identify the 'third color'.
    *   Create the output grid with a fixed pattern: pixels where `r < c + 1` are white, pixels where `r == c + 1` or `r == c + 2` are red, and pixels where `r > c + 2` are the 'third color'.

3.  **Column Filter with Downward Propagation Rule:** If neither Rule 1 nor Rule 2 applies, perform the following for each column independently:
    *   Find the row index (`mr`) of the topmost red pixel in the input column.
    *   If no red pixel exists in the column, the output column is identical to the input column.
    *   If a topmost red pixel exists at `mr`:
        *   Initialize the output column corresponding to the input column.
        *   Set rows `0` to `mr-1` in the output column to white.
        *   The pixel at `(mr, col)` remains red.
        *   Process rows from `mr + 1` downwards: If a pixel in the output column is white, change its color to match the color of the pixel directly above it in the output column. Otherwise, keep its current color (which was copied from the input initially). This propagates the color found at or above `mr` downwards through any original white space below `mr`.
