**Assessment and Strategy**

1.  **Assessment:** The provided code successfully solved Examples 2 and 3 by applying Rule 1 (Solid Row Separation) and Rule 2 (Fixed Diagonal Pattern), respectively. However, it failed on Example 1, which defaulted to Rule 3 (Column Filter). The transformed output for Example 1 differs from the expected output in the way colors are handled *below* the topmost red pixel in certain columns. Specifically, the propagation logic seems incorrect; it appears to be overwriting non-background colors with the propagated color when it should only be filling in original background (white) pixels.
2.  **Strategy:**
    *   Confirm that Rules 1 and 2 are correctly identifying their respective cases and producing the correct output based on Examples 2 and 3. This seems to be the case.
    *   Focus on refining Rule 3 based on the discrepancy observed in Example 1.
    *   Analyze the difference between the input, expected output, and transformed output for Example 1, column by column, paying close attention to the pixels below the topmost red pixel.
    *   Modify the description of Rule 3's downward propagation step: the propagation should only fill pixels that were *originally* white (0) in the input grid; other pixels below the topmost red should retain their original color from the input grid.
    *   Update the Natural Language Program and Facts to reflect this refined understanding of Rule 3.

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation determines the output grid by applying the first matching rule from the following prioritized list, using red (2) as the primary color and white (0) as the background color:

1.  **Solid Row Separation Rule:** Check if the input grid contains exactly three unique colors AND if it has a horizontal row composed entirely of the primary color (red). If both conditions are true:
    *   Identify the 'third color' (neither white nor red).
    *   Find the row index (`sr`) of the topmost solid red row.
    *   Create the output grid by filling rows `0` to `sr-1` with white, row `sr` with red, and rows `sr+1` to the bottom with the 'third color'.

2.  **Fixed Diagonal Pattern Rule:** If Rule 1 does not apply, check if the input grid contains exactly three unique colors AND if *all* red pixels are located at positions `(r, c)` where `r = c + 1` or `r = c + 2`. If both conditions are true:
    *   Identify the 'third color'.
    *   Create the output grid with a fixed pattern: pixels where `r < c + 1` are white, pixels where `r == c + 1` or `r == c + 2` are red, and pixels where `r > c + 2` are the 'third color'.

3.  **Column Filter with Conditional Downward Propagation Rule:** If neither Rule 1 nor Rule 2 applies, construct the output grid by processing each column independently based on the input grid:
    *   Find the row index (`mr`) of the topmost red pixel in the input column.
    *   If no red pixel exists in the input column, the output column is identical to the input column.
    *   If a topmost red pixel exists at `mr` in the input column:
        *   Initialize the corresponding output column.
        *   Set rows `0` to `mr-1` in the output column to white.
        *   Set the pixel at `(mr, col)` in the output column to red.
        *   For each row `r` from `mr + 1` downwards to the bottom of the grid:
            *   Examine the pixel at `(r, col)` in the *input* grid.
            *   If the input pixel `input_grid[r, col]` is white (0), set the output pixel `output_grid[r, col]` to the color of the pixel directly above it in the *output* grid (`output_grid[r - 1, col]`).
            *   Otherwise (if `input_grid[r, col]` is not white), set the output pixel `output_grid[r, col]` to its original color from the input grid (`input_grid[r, col]`).
