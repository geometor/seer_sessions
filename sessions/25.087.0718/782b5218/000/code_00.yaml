task_elements:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
    properties:
      - height: variable (1-30)
      - width: variable (1-30)
      - pixels: integer values 0-9 representing colors
  - name: colors
    type: set of integers present in the grid
    properties:
      - background_color: typically 0 (white)
      - key_color: a specific non-background color triggering transformations (e.g., 2 (red))
      - third_color: another non-background color used in some rules (e.g., 1 (blue), 5 (gray), 8 (azure))
  - name: structures
    type: patterns or arrangements of pixels
    properties:
      - solid_horizontal_row: a row composed entirely of the key_color
      - column_highest_key_pixel: the uppermost pixel of the key_color within a column
      - fixed_diagonal_band: a specific geometric pattern used in Rule 2

relationships:
  - description: The transformation rule depends on the configuration of the key_color and the number/identity of colors present.
  - condition: Presence of a solid_horizontal_row of the key_color.
    action: Apply Rule 1 (Row Separation).
  - condition: Absence of solid_horizontal_row AND presence of exactly three distinct colors (background, key, third).
    action: Apply Rule 2 (Fixed Diagonal Pattern Construction).
  - condition: Absence of conditions for Rule 1 and Rule 2.
    action: Apply Rule 3 (Column Filtering based on key_color).

actions:
  - name: identify_colors
    description: Find unique colors, identify background, key, and third colors.
  - name: detect_solid_row
    description: Check if any row consists solely of the key_color.
  - name: apply_row_separation
    description: Modify grid based on the solid row separator (Rule 1). Fill above with background, below with third color, keep separator.
  - name: apply_fixed_pattern
    description: Construct output grid using the fixed diagonal band pattern (Rule 2) with key_color, third_color, and background_color.
  - name: apply_column_filter
    description: Modify grid column by column (Rule 3). Find highest key_color pixel, set pixels above to background.
