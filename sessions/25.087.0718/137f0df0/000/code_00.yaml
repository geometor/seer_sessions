task_description: Identify completely white rows and columns that act as separators between gray blocks and fill them, marking the edges of the fill.

definitions:
  - &white 0
  - &blue 1
  - &red 2
  - &gray 5
  - &grid_input The input 2D array of pixels.
  - &grid_output The output 2D array of pixels.
  - &height Height of the grid.
  - &width Width of the grid.
  - &gray_block A contiguous region of gray (*gray) pixels.

grid_elements:
  - type: background
    color: *white
  - type: object
    color: *gray
    description: Typically 2x2 squares, arranged with spacing.

identification:
  - step: find_separating_rows
    input: *grid_input
    output: list_of_row_indices
    criteria:
      - Row `r` (1 <= r < *height - 1) consists entirely of *white pixels.
      - Row `r-1` contains at least one *gray pixel.
      - Row `r+1` contains at least one *gray pixel.
  - step: find_separating_columns
    input: *grid_input
    output: list_of_column_indices
    criteria:
      - Column `c` (1 <= c < *width - 1) consists entirely of *white pixels.
      - Column `c-1` contains at least one *gray pixel.
      - Column `c+1` contains at least one *gray pixel.

transformations:
  - step: initialize_output
    action: Copy *grid_input to *grid_output.
  - step: fill_separators
    input:
      - *grid_output
      - list_of_row_indices
      - list_of_column_indices
      - *grid_input (for reference)
    output: Modified *grid_output
    action:
      - Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the grid.
      - If `r` is in list_of_row_indices OR `c` is in list_of_column_indices:
        - If `grid_input[r][c]` is *white:
          - Determine if the cell is an 'edge' cell:
            - Check 4 neighbors `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)`.
            - An edge exists if a neighbor `(nr, nc)` is within grid bounds AND `grid_input[nr][nc]` is *white AND (`nr` is NOT in list_of_row_indices AND `nc` is NOT in list_of_column_indices).
          - If an edge exists:
            - Set `grid_output[r][c]` to *blue.
          - Else (not an edge):
            - Set `grid_output[r][c]` to *red.
        # Implicitly: if grid_input[r][c] was not white (e.g., gray), it remains unchanged because grid_output started as a copy.

final_output: *grid_output
