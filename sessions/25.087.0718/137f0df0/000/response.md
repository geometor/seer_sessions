Okay, let's break down this task.

### Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consist of a white (0) background with multiple gray (5) blocks, often 2x2 squares, arranged in a grid-like pattern. These gray blocks are separated by rows and columns composed entirely of white (0) pixels.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the original gray (5) blocks in their positions. The key change happens in the white (0) separating rows and columns.
3.  **Transformation - Red (2):** The white rows and columns that lie *between* gray blocks (one block above/below for rows, one block left/right for columns) are filled with red (2). This includes the intersections of these red rows and columns.
4.  **Transformation - Blue (1):** Some white pixels within these newly designated red rows/columns are changed to blue (1) instead of red (2). These blue pixels appear at the "ends" or "edges" of the filled red areas. Specifically, a white pixel that would turn red becomes blue if it is adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to an original white pixel that *does not* get turned red.
5.  **Constancy:** The gray (5) pixels from the input remain unchanged in the output, even if they fall on a row or column designated to become red. Other white pixels that are not part of the separating rows/columns also remain unchanged.

  - &grid_output The output 2D array of pixels.
  - &height Height of the grid.
  - &width Width of the grid.
  - &gray_block A contiguous region of gray (*gray) pixels.

grid_elements:
  - type: background
    color: *white
  - type: object
    color: *gray
    description: Typically 2x2 squares, arranged with spacing.

identification:
  - step: find_separating_rows
    input: *grid_input
    output: list_of_row_indices
    criteria:
      - Row `r` (1 <= r < *height - 1) consists entirely of *white pixels.
      - Row `r-1` contains at least one *gray pixel.
      - Row `r+1` contains at least one *gray pixel.
  - step: find_separating_columns
    input: *grid_input
    output: list_of_column_indices
    criteria:
      - Column `c` (1 <= c < *width - 1) consists entirely of *white pixels.
      - Column `c-1` contains at least one *gray pixel.
      - Column `c+1` contains at least one *gray pixel.

transformations:
  - step: initialize_output
    action: Copy *grid_input to *grid_output.
  - step: fill_separators
    input:
      - *grid_output
      - list_of_row_indices
      - list_of_column_indices
      - *grid_input (for reference)
    output: Modified *grid_output
    action:
      - Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the grid.
      - If `r` is in list_of_row_indices OR `c` is in list_of_column_indices:
        - If `grid_input[r][c]` is *white:
          - Determine if the cell is an 'edge' cell:
            - Check 4 neighbors `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)`.
            - An edge exists if a neighbor `(nr, nc)` is within grid bounds AND `grid_input[nr][nc]` is *white AND (`nr` is NOT in list_of_row_indices AND `nc` is NOT in list_of_column_indices).
          - If an edge exists:
            - Set `grid_output[r][c]` to *blue.
          - Else (not an edge):
            - Set `grid_output[r][c]` to *red.
        # Implicitly: if grid_input[r][c] was not white (e.g., gray), it remains unchanged because grid_output started as a copy.

final_output: *grid_output
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Identify all row indices `r` (excluding the first and last rows) such that row `r` in the input grid consists entirely of white pixels, the row above it (`r-1`) contains at least one gray pixel, and the row below it (`r+1`) contains at least one gray pixel. Store these indices as "red rows".
3.  Identify all column indices `c` (excluding the first and last columns) such that column `c` in the input grid consists entirely of white pixels, the column to its left (`c-1`) contains at least one gray pixel, and the column to its right (`c+1`) contains at least one gray pixel. Store these indices as "red columns".
4.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
5.  Check if the current cell's row index `r` is in the list of "red rows" OR its column index `c` is in the list of "red columns".
6.  If it is, and if the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *original input grid* was white (0):
    a.  Determine the target color: Assume the color will be red (2).
    b.  Check the four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) of `(r, c)`.
    c.  For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` that is within the grid boundaries:
        i.  Check if the neighbor pixel `(nr, nc)` in the *original input grid* was white (0).
        ii. Check if the neighbor's row `nr` is NOT in the "red rows" list AND the neighbor's column `nc` is NOT in the "red columns" list.
        iii. If both conditions (i and ii) are true for any neighbor, change the target color for `(r, c)` to blue (1) and stop checking neighbors for this cell.
    d.  Set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to the determined target color (either red or blue).
7.  If the condition in step 5 is false, or if the original pixel was not white (e.g., it was gray), the pixel in the output grid retains its copied value from the input grid.
8.  The final modified grid is the result.
