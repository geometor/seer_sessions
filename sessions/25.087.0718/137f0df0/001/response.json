Identify rows (excluding borders) that are entirely white and are positioned between rows containing at least one gray pixel.\n2. Identify columns (excluding borders) that are entirely white and are positioned between columns containing at least one gray pixel.\n3. Create a copy of the input grid.\n4. Iterate through each cell of the grid.\n5. If a cell's row index is identified as a separator row OR its column index is identified as a separator column, AND the cell's original color is white:\n    a. Check its four cardinal neighbors in the original input grid.\n    b. If any neighbor is within bounds, is white, and its coordinates do NOT correspond to a separator row or column, mark the current cell's target color as blue.\n    c. Otherwise, mark the current cell's target color as red.\n    d. Update the cell in the output grid with the target color (blue or red).\n6.
