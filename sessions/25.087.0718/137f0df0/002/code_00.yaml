Task: Fill white separators between gray blocks.

Colors:
  WHITE: 0
  BLUE: 1
  RED: 2
  GRAY: 5

Input Grid:
  Properties:
    - Contains GRAY pixels, forming blocks or regions.
    - Contains WHITE pixels, potentially forming rows, columns, or larger areas.
    - Other colors are possible but not relevant to the core transformation.

Objects:
  - Gray Regions: Areas containing one or more GRAY pixels.
  - White Separator Rows: Maximal contiguous blocks of entirely WHITE rows where the row immediately above the block contains GRAY, and the row immediately below the block contains GRAY.
  - White Separator Columns: Maximal contiguous blocks of entirely WHITE columns where the column immediately left of the block contains GRAY, and the column immediately right of the block contains GRAY.
  - Non-Separator White Regions: Any WHITE pixel/area that is not part of a White Separator Row or Column.

Actions:
  1. Identify Separators:
     - Find all maximal contiguous blocks of all-WHITE rows.
     - Mark a block as 'separator rows' if the rows bounding it vertically contain GRAY.
     - Find all maximal contiguous blocks of all-WHITE columns.
     - Mark a block as 'separator columns' if the columns bounding it horizontally contain GRAY.
  2. Fill Separators:
     - Create a copy of the input grid.
     - Iterate through each pixel (r, c) in the input grid.
     - If pixel (r, c) is WHITE AND (row r is part of a separator row block OR column c is part of a separator column block):
       - Determine if it's an edge: Check its 4 cardinal neighbors (nr, nc) in the original grid. If any neighbor is WHITE AND (row nr is NOT a separator row AND column nc is NOT a separator column), then (r, c) is an edge.
       - If (r, c) is an edge, set its color in the output grid to BLUE (1).
       - Otherwise (it's an internal separator pixel), set its color in the output grid to RED (2).
  3. Preserve Others:
     - All pixels that were not originally WHITE, or were WHITE but not part of any separator row/column, retain their original color in the output grid.

Output Grid: The modified grid after filling the separators.
