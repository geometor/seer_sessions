The `tool_code` analysis confirms the refined logic for identifying separators.

*   Example 2:
    *   Separator rows: [2, 5] (Correctly identifies the single rows between gray areas).
    *   Separator columns: [4, 5] (Correctly identifies the block of columns between gray areas).
*   Example 3:
    *   Separator rows: [2, 3, 6, 7] (Correctly identifies the blocks of rows {2, 3} and {6, 7} between gray areas).
    *   Separator columns: [3, 6] (Correctly identifies the single columns between gray areas).

This confirms that the separator identification needs to consider contiguous blocks of white lines. The edge condition (painting blue) also needs to be based on whether a neighbor is white AND *not* part of *any* separator line (row or column).

Now, I can formulate the updated report.## General Assessment

The initial code successfully solved Example 1 but failed on Examples 2 and 3. The failures indicate that the definition of "separator" rows and columns was too narrow. The code treated each white row/column independently, checking only its immediate neighbors for gray pixels. However, Examples 2 and 3 demonstrate that separators can be contiguous *blocks* of white rows or columns. A block of white rows/columns acts as a separator if it lies entirely between rows/columns containing gray pixels.

The strategy to resolve this is:

1.  Modify the identification logic to find maximal contiguous blocks of all-white rows and columns.
2.  Determine if a white block is a "separator" by checking if the line (row or column) immediately preceding the block *and* the line immediately following the block contain at least one gray pixel.
3.  Apply the coloring logic (red for internal separator cells, blue for edges) based on this updated definition of separator rows and columns. The edge condition (blue) applies if a white separator cell is adjacent to a white cell that is *not* part of any separator row or column.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze the discrepancies in the failed examples:

**Example 2:**

*   Input: 10x10 grid with gray 2x2 blocks separated by white lines.
*   Expected Output: White rows 2 and 5, and white columns 4 and 5 are filled.
*   Actual Output (from previous code): Only white rows 2 and 5 were partially filled. Columns 4 and 5 were left white.
*   Reason: The previous code checked `c-1` and `c+1` for gray. Column 4 is adjacent to gray (col 3) and white (col 5). Column 5 is adjacent to white (col 4) and gray (col 6). Neither individually met the condition. The new logic correctly identifies the *block* of columns {4, 5} as a separator because column 3 (left) has gray and column 6 (right) has gray.

**Example 3:**

*   Input: 10x10 grid, similar structure but different gray block placement.
*   Expected Output: White rows 2, 3, 6, 7 and white columns 3, 6 are filled.
*   Actual Output (from previous code): Only white columns 3 and 6 were partially filled. Rows 2, 3, 6, 7 were left white.
*   Reason: Similar to Example 2, the previous code failed to identify the *blocks* of white rows {2, 3} and {6, 7} as separators because it checked only single rows and their immediate neighbors. Row 2 is between gray (row 1) and white (row 3). Row 3 is between white (row 2) and white (row 4). The new logic identifies block {2, 3} because row 1 (above) has gray and row 4 (below) has gray. Similarly for rows {6, 7}.

The `tool_code` outputs confirm the locations of the errors align with the failure to identify multi-row/column white separators.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Task: Fill white separators between gray blocks.

Colors:
  WHITE: 0
  BLUE: 1
  RED: 2
  GRAY: 5

Input Grid:
  Properties:
    - Contains GRAY pixels, forming blocks or regions.
    - Contains WHITE pixels, potentially forming rows, columns, or larger areas.
    - Other colors are possible but not relevant to the core transformation.

Objects:
  - Gray Regions: Areas containing one or more GRAY pixels.
  - White Separator Rows: Maximal contiguous blocks of entirely WHITE rows where the row immediately above the block contains GRAY, and the row immediately below the block contains GRAY.
  - White Separator Columns: Maximal contiguous blocks of entirely WHITE columns where the column immediately left of the block contains GRAY, and the column immediately right of the block contains GRAY.
  - Non-Separator White Regions: Any WHITE pixel/area that is not part of a White Separator Row or Column.

Actions:
  1. Identify Separators:
     - Find all maximal contiguous blocks of all-WHITE rows.
     - Mark a block as 'separator rows' if the rows bounding it vertically contain GRAY.
     - Find all maximal contiguous blocks of all-WHITE columns.
     - Mark a block as 'separator columns' if the columns bounding it horizontally contain GRAY.
  2. Fill Separators:
     - Create a copy of the input grid.
     - Iterate through each pixel (r, c) in the input grid.
     - If pixel (r, c) is WHITE AND (row r is part of a separator row block OR column c is part of a separator column block):
       - Determine if it's an edge: Check its 4 cardinal neighbors (nr, nc) in the original grid. If any neighbor is WHITE AND (row nr is NOT a separator row AND column nc is NOT a separator column), then (r, c) is an edge.
       - If (r, c) is an edge, set its color in the output grid to BLUE (1).
       - Otherwise (it's an internal separator pixel), set its color in the output grid to RED (2).
  3. Preserve Others:
     - All pixels that were not originally WHITE, or were WHITE but not part of any separator row/column, retain their original color in the output grid.

Output Grid: The modified grid after filling the separators.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty set `separator_rows` and `separator_cols` to store the indices of rows and columns identified as separators.
2.  **Identify Separator Row Blocks:**
    a. Find all row indices `r` where the entire row `input_grid[r, :]` consists only of WHITE pixels.
    b. Group these white row indices into maximal contiguous blocks (e.g., if rows 2, 3, 4 are all white, they form one block {2, 3, 4}).
    c. For each contiguous block of white rows starting at `start_row` and ending at `end_row`:
        i. Check if `start_row > 0` and the row `input_grid[start_row - 1, :]` contains at least one GRAY pixel.
        ii. Check if `end_row < height - 1` and the row `input_grid[end_row + 1, :]` contains at least one GRAY pixel.
        iii. If both conditions (i) and (ii) are true, add all row indices from `start_row` to `end_row` (inclusive) to the `separator_rows` set.
3.  **Identify Separator Column Blocks:**
    a. Find all column indices `c` where the entire column `input_grid[:, c]` consists only of WHITE pixels.
    b. Group these white column indices into maximal contiguous blocks.
    c. For each contiguous block of white columns starting at `start_col` and ending at `end_col`:
        i. Check if `start_col > 0` and the column `input_grid[:, start_col - 1]` contains at least one GRAY pixel.
        ii. Check if `end_col < width - 1` and the column `input_grid[:, end_col + 1]` contains at least one GRAY pixel.
        iii. If both conditions (i) and (ii) are true, add all column indices from `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive) to the `separator_cols` set.
4.  Create the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
5.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` from `(0, 0)` to `(height-1, width-1)`:
    a. If the original color `input_grid[r, c]` is WHITE AND (`r` is in `separator_rows` OR `c` is in `separator_cols`):
        i. Set `is_edge = False`.
        ii. Check the four cardinal neighbors `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)`.
        iii. For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` that is within the grid boundaries:
            1. If `input_grid[nr, nc]` is WHITE AND (`nr` is NOT in `separator_rows` AND `nc` is NOT in `separator_cols`):
                Set `is_edge = True` and break the neighbor check loop.
        iv. If `is_edge` is `True`, set `output_grid[r, c]` to BLUE (1).
        v. Else (if `is_edge` is `False`), set `output_grid[r, c]` to RED (2).
6.  Return the `output_grid`.
