"""
Transforms the input grid by applying a checkerboard pattern of yellow (4) to the white (0) background pixels. 
The specific checkerboard pattern (which cells become yellow) depends on the parity of the row index of the horizontal green (3) line. 
If the horizontal green line is in an even row index, white cells (r, c) where (r + c) is even become yellow. 
If the horizontal green line is in an odd row index, white cells (r, c) where (r + c) is odd become yellow. 
The green (3) cross structure is preserved in the output.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code attempted to solve the task by applying a simple checkerboard pattern to the white background pixels, where the specific checkerboard (which parity of `r+c` becomes yellow) depended solely on the parity of the row index of the horizontal green line. This approach failed because the actual transformation rule is more complex.

The comparison between the expected outputs and the outputs generated by the code reveals that:
1.  The green cross structure (color 3) is correctly preserved.
2.  Only white pixels (color 0) are changed, and they become yellow (color 4).
3.  The pattern of yellow pixels applied to the white background is not a simple global checkerboard based on `(r+c)%2` and the horizontal line's row parity.
4.  Instead, the pattern seems to be determined locally, based on which quadrant the pixel resides in, relative to the green cross.
5.  A specific 2x2 pattern of white (0) and yellow (4) appears to be tiled across each quadrant.
6.  The choice of the 2x2 pattern for each quadrant seems to depend on the location (specifically, the row and column parity) of the green cross's intersection.

**Strategy:**
1.  Precisely locate the horizontal green line row (`cross_r`) and the vertical green line column (`cross_c`) in each input example.
2.  Determine the parities `parity_r = cross_r % 2` and `parity_c = cross_c % 2`.
3.  Analyze the *expected* output grids to identify the 2x2 patterns used for tiling in each of the four quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), Bottom-Right (BR). A quadrant is defined relative to `cross_r` and `cross_c`.
4.  Map the relationship between the cross parity `(parity_r, parity_c)` and the set of four 2x2 patterns `{P_TL, P_TR, P_BL, P_BR}` based on the available examples.
5.  Update the natural language program to describe this quadrant-based 2x2 tiling mechanism.
6.  Structure these findings clearly in the metrics and YAML sections.
