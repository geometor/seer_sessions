            "text": "**Perception:**\n\nThe input grid consists of a large `white` (0) background with a `green` (3) cross shape formed by a single horizontal line and a single vertical line. The size of the grid and the exact position of the green cross vary between examples.\n\nThe output grid retains the original `green` (3) cross. The key transformation occurs on the `white` (0) background pixels. Some of these pixels are changed to `yellow` (4), while others remain `white` (0). The pattern of `yellow` pixels forms a checkerboard across the entire grid, excluding the green lines.\n\nThere are two possible checkerboard patterns: one where cells `(r, c)` with `(r + c) % 2 == 0` are colored yellow, and one where cells with `(r + c) % 2 == 1` are colored yellow. The specific checkerboard pattern used in the output seems to depend on the row index of the horizontal green line. If the row index of the horizontal green line is even, the checkerboard pattern where `(r + c) % 2 == 0` is yellow is used. If the row index is odd, the checkerboard pattern where `(r + c) % 2 == 1` is yellow is used.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
