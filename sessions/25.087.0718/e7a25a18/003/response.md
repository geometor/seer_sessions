Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the Frame: Find all contiguous non-white objects in the input grid. Select the object with the largest number of pixels as the 'frame'. Determine its color and its bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column).
2. Crop to Frame: Create the initial output grid by extracting the portion of the input grid defined by the frame's bounding box.
3. Identify Internal Objects: Find all non-white objects from the input grid that are *not* the frame object and whose bounding boxes lie strictly within the inner area of the frame's bounding box (i.e., between min_row+1, min_col+1 and max_row-1, max_col-1).
4. Sort Internal Objects: If there are exactly four internal objects, sort them based on their position using their top-left corner coordinates: primarily by row (ascending), and secondarily by column (ascending).
5. Fill Internal Quadrants:
    - Divide the internal area of the *output* grid (all pixels excluding the 1-pixel border) into four equal quadrants: top-left (TL), top-right (TR), bottom-left (BL), and bottom-right (BR). Handle potential rounding for odd dimensions using integer division for midpoints.
    - Fill the TL quadrant with the color of the first sorted internal object.
    - Fill the TR quadrant with the color of the second sorted internal object.
    - Fill the BL quadrant with the color of the third sorted internal object.
    - Fill the BR quadrant with the color of the fourth sorted internal object.
6. Handle Other Cases (Implicit): If the number of internal objects is one, fill the entire inner area with that object's color. Other counts are not explicitly handled based on examples.
7. Final Output: The modified cropped grid is the final output.
