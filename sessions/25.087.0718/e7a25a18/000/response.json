            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs contain a large background area (white, color 0) and a prominent rectangular frame made of a single color (red, color 2 in both examples). Inside this frame, there's a smaller area, also initially containing white pixels, along with smaller objects of different colors.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The outputs consist solely of the frame and its contents from the input, effectively cropped to the frame's boundaries. The area inside the frame in the output is completely filled with colors derived from the small objects present inside the frame in the input. The frame itself remains the same color and shape.\n3.  **Key Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the frame, cropping the grid to the frame's extent, and then expanding the small internal objects to fill the space within the frame according to their relative positions.\n4.  **Frame Identification:** The frame appears to be the largest contiguous rectangle of a single, non-white color.\n5.  **Internal Objects:** These are the distinct colored shapes or pixels found *inside* the frame's boundaries in the input. They are not white and not the same color as the frame.\n6.  **Expansion Logic:** The internal objects seem to define regions within the frame. In the output, each object's color is expanded to fill its corresponding region. In the examples, there are four internal objects arranged roughly in quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), and the internal space of the frame is divided into four equal quadrants, each filled with the color of the object from that relative position. The original size of the internal objects (2x2 in train_1, 1x1 in train_2) determines the scale of expansion needed to fill the quadrants of the inner frame area (which is 8x8 in train_1, 4x4 in train_2).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Frame:** Scan the input grid to find the largest contiguous rectangular object composed of a single, non-white color. Let this color be `frame_color` and the rectangle's outer boundaries define the `frame_area`.\n2.  **Crop to Frame:** Create the output grid with the same dimensions as the `frame_area`. Copy the pixels corresponding to the `frame_area` from the input grid to the output grid.\n3.  **Identify Internal Objects:** Within the `frame_area` of the input grid, identify all distinct contiguous objects (even single pixels) whose color is neither white (0) nor `frame_color`. Record the color and approximate relative position (e.g., top-left quadrant, bottom-right quadrant) of each internal object.\n4.  **Define Internal Regions:** Determine the dimensions of the area strictly *inside* the frame (excluding the frame border itself). Divide this internal area into a grid of equally sized rectangular regions, such that the number and arrangement of regions match the number and relative positions of the internal objects identified in step 3. (For example, if there are 4 internal objects in a 2x2 arrangement, divide the internal area into 4 equal quadrants).\n5.  **Fill Regions:** For each region defined in step 4, determine which internal object corresponds to it based on relative position. Fill all pixels within that region in the output grid with the color of the corresponding internal object. Ensure the original frame pixels (color `frame_color`) remain unchanged."
