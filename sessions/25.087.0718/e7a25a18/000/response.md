Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs contain a large background area (white, color 0) and a prominent rectangular frame made of a single color (red, color 2 in both examples). Inside this frame, there's a smaller area, also initially containing white pixels, along with smaller objects of different colors.
2.  **Output Structure:** The outputs consist solely of the frame and its contents from the input, effectively cropped to the frame's boundaries. The area inside the frame in the output is completely filled with colors derived from the small objects present inside the frame in the input. The frame itself remains the same color and shape.
3.  **Key Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the frame, cropping the grid to the frame's extent, and then expanding the small internal objects to fill the space within the frame according to their relative positions.
4.  **Frame Identification:** The frame appears to be the largest contiguous rectangle of a single, non-white color.
5.  **Internal Objects:** These are the distinct colored shapes or pixels found *inside* the frame's boundaries in the input. They are not white and not the same color as the frame.
6.  **Expansion Logic:** The internal objects seem to define regions within the frame. In the output, each object's color is expanded to fill its corresponding region. In the examples, there are four internal objects arranged roughly in quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), and the internal space of the frame is divided into four equal quadrants, each filled with the color of the object from that relative position. The original size of the internal objects (2x2 in train_1, 1x1 in train_2) determines the scale of expansion needed to fill the quadrants of the inner frame area (which is 8x8 in train_1, 4x4 in train_2).

**Facts:**

task_elements:
  - description: Input grids contain a primary rectangular frame object.
    properties:
      color: Non-white (red=2 in examples)
      shape: Rectangle
      role: Defines the boundary for the output grid and contains internal elements.
  - description: Background exists outside the frame.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: Ignored in the output.
  - description: Internal objects exist inside the frame.
    properties:
      color: Non-white, different from the frame color.
      size: Can vary (e.g., 2x2 pixels, 1x1 pixel).
      count: Multiple (4 in examples).
      arrangement: Positioned within the frame's internal area (e.g., defining quadrants).
      role: Their colors are used to fill the internal area of the output frame.
  - description: Internal background exists inside the frame.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: Replaced by expanded internal object colors in the output.

transformation:
  - action: Identify the frame object.
    details: Find the largest single-colored, non-white rectangle.
  - action: Crop the grid.
    details: The output grid dimensions match the outer dimensions of the identified frame. The content is initially the frame itself and its internal contents.
  - action: Identify internal objects.
    details: Locate all distinct non-white, non-frame colored objects strictly within the inner boundary of the frame. Note their colors and relative positions (e.g., top-left, top-right).
  - action: Determine internal partitioning.
    details: Based on the number and relative arrangement of internal objects, divide the area *inside* the frame into corresponding regions (e.g., if 4 objects are in quadrants, divide the inner area into 4 equal quadrants).
  - action: Fill internal regions.
    details: In the output grid, fill each internal region completely with the color of the corresponding internal object from the input grid. The frame pixels remain unchanged.

relationships:
  - type: containment
    from: Internal objects
    to: Frame object
  - type: boundary
    element: Frame object
    defines: Extent of the output grid.
  - type: mapping
    from: Input internal object color and relative position
    to: Output internal region color and location.
  - type: scaling/expansion
    element: Internal objects
    result: Their colors fill larger regions in the output.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Frame:** Scan the input grid to find the largest contiguous rectangular object composed of a single, non-white color. Let this color be `frame_color` and the rectangle's outer boundaries define the `frame_area`.
2.  **Crop to Frame:** Create the output grid with the same dimensions as the `frame_area`. Copy the pixels corresponding to the `frame_area` from the input grid to the output grid.
3.  **Identify Internal Objects:** Within the `frame_area` of the input grid, identify all distinct contiguous objects (even single pixels) whose color is neither white (0) nor `frame_color`. Record the color and approximate relative position (e.g., top-left quadrant, bottom-right quadrant) of each internal object.
4.  **Define Internal Regions:** Determine the dimensions of the area strictly *inside* the frame (excluding the frame border itself). Divide this internal area into a grid of equally sized rectangular regions, such that the number and arrangement of regions match the number and relative positions of the internal objects identified in step 3. (For example, if there are 4 internal objects in a 2x2 arrangement, divide the internal area into 4 equal quadrants).
5.  **Fill Regions:** For each region defined in step 4, determine which internal object corresponds to it based on relative position. Fill all pixels within that region in the output grid with the color of the corresponding internal object. Ensure the original frame pixels (color `frame_color`) remain unchanged.
