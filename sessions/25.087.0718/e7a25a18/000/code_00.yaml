task_elements:
  - description: Input grids contain a primary rectangular frame object.
    properties:
      color: Non-white (red=2 in examples)
      shape: Rectangle
      role: Defines the boundary for the output grid and contains internal elements.
  - description: Background exists outside the frame.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: Ignored in the output.
  - description: Internal objects exist inside the frame.
    properties:
      color: Non-white, different from the frame color.
      size: Can vary (e.g., 2x2 pixels, 1x1 pixel).
      count: Multiple (4 in examples).
      arrangement: Positioned within the frame's internal area (e.g., defining quadrants).
      role: Their colors are used to fill the internal area of the output frame.
  - description: Internal background exists inside the frame.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: Replaced by expanded internal object colors in the output.

transformation:
  - action: Identify the frame object.
    details: Find the largest single-colored, non-white rectangle.
  - action: Crop the grid.
    details: The output grid dimensions match the outer dimensions of the identified frame. The content is initially the frame itself and its internal contents.
  - action: Identify internal objects.
    details: Locate all distinct non-white, non-frame colored objects strictly within the inner boundary of the frame. Note their colors and relative positions (e.g., top-left, top-right).
  - action: Determine internal partitioning.
    details: Based on the number and relative arrangement of internal objects, divide the area *inside* the frame into corresponding regions (e.g., if 4 objects are in quadrants, divide the inner area into 4 equal quadrants).
  - action: Fill internal regions.
    details: In the output grid, fill each internal region completely with the color of the corresponding internal object from the input grid. The frame pixels remain unchanged.

relationships:
  - type: containment
    from: Internal objects
    to: Frame object
  - type: boundary
    element: Frame object
    defines: Extent of the output grid.
  - type: mapping
    from: Input internal object color and relative position
    to: Output internal region color and location.
  - type: scaling/expansion
    element: Internal objects
    result: Their colors fill larger regions in the output.
