            "text": "The median calculation confirms T2 and T3 but gives 4x5 for T1, where the output is 4x4. My median hypothesis is incorrect for T1.\n\nLet's re-examine T1 and the \"most common size\" hypothesis.\nSizes: 5x4 (1), 4x5 (2). Most common size is 4x5. Output is 4x4.\nWhy could it be 4x4?\nPerhaps the dimensions are determined independently?\nHeights: 5, 4, 4. Most common height = 4.\nWidths: 4, 5, 5. Most common width = 5.\nThis still gives 4x5.\n\nWhat if the size is determined by the *content* bounding box size, not the white rectangle size?\n*   T1 Contents (tight bbox):\n    *   Red: `[[2,2]]` -> 1x2\n    *   Green: `[[3,3],[3,3]]` -> 2x2\n    *   Yellow: `[[4,4,4,4]]` -> 1x4\n    *   Sizes: 1x2, 2x2, 1x4. Most common H=1, Most common W=?. Median H=1, Median W=2. Neither gives 4x4.\n*   Let's go back to the white rectangles.\n    *   T1: 5x4, 4x5, 4x5. Output: 4x4.\n    *   T2: 4x4, 3x4, 3x4, 2x4. Output: 3x4.\n    *   T3: 4x5, 4x5. Output: 4x5.\n*   Could the output size be the size of the *intersection* of all white rectangles? No, they don't overlap.\n*   Could the output size be the size of the *smallest* white rectangle?\n    *   T1: Smallest area is 5x4=20 or 4x5=20. Ambiguous. Smallest H=4, Smallest W=4. -> 4x4? Match!\n    *   T2: Sizes 4x4, 3x4, 3x4, 2x4. Smallest H=2, Smallest W=4. -> 2x4? No, output is 3x4.\n    *   T3: Sizes 4x5, 4x5. Smallest H=4, Smallest W=5. -> 4x5? Match!\n*   This \"Smallest H x Smallest W\" hypothesis works for T1 and T3, but not T2.\n\nLet's try \"Mode H x Mode W\".\n*   T1: Heights (5, 4, 4) -> Mode 4. Widths (4, 5, 5) -> Mode 5. Size 4x5. No.\n*   T2: Heights (4, 3, 3, 2) -> Mode 3. Widths (4, 4, 4, 4) -> Mode 4. Size 3x4. Match!\n*   T3: Heights (4, 4) -> Mode 4. Widths (5, 5) -> Mode 5. Size 4x5. Match!\nThis \"Mode H x Mode W\" hypothesis works for T2 and T3. Why does T1 (output 4x4) fail? Its mode size is 4x5. Is there a rule to choose 4x4 instead of 4x5 if the mode is ambiguous or if multiple modes exist? T1 has mode H=4, mode W=5. Output uses mode H, but min W (4) instead of mode W (5)? That seems arbitrary.\n\nWhat if the resizing/cropping step is key?\nMaybe the output grid is always the size of the *first* white rectangle, and subsequent contents are cropped/padded and overlaid?\n*   T1: First box 5x4. Output 4x4. No.\n*   T2: First box 4x4. Output 3x4. No.\n*   T3: First box 4x5. Output 4x5. Match.\n\nLet's reconsider the overlay process and the T1 mismatch (`[[4,4,4,4],[3,3,0,0],[3,3,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]` vs `[[4,4,4,4],[3,3,0,0],[3,3,0,0],[0,2,2,0]]`).\nThe overlay process where non-white only overwrites white worked. The issue is the size and the cropping/alignment.\n\nAssume the \"Mode H x Mode W\" size hypothesis is correct (works for T2, T3).\n*   T1 Mode Size is 4x5. Output is 4x4.\n*   T2 Mode Size is 3x4. Output is 3x4.\n*   T3 Mode Size is 4x5. Output is 4x5.\n\nWhy is T1 different? Perhaps the final output grid is cropped to remove any all-white rows/columns after the overlay?\n*   Overlay result for T1 using 4x5 mode size:\n    *   Resize C1 (5x4) to 4x5 (crop bottom row, pad right col): `[[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,2,2,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0]]`\n    *   Resize C2 (4x5) to 4x5 (no change): `[[0,0,0,0,0],[3,3,0,0,0],[3,3,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0]]`\n    *   Resize C3 (4x5) to 4x5 (no change): `[[4,4,4,4,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0]]`\n    *   Overlay onto 4x5 white grid (non-white overwrites only white):\n        *   +C1: `[[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,2,2,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0]]`\n        *   +C2: `[[0,0,0,0,0],[3,3,0,0,0],[3,3,0,0,0],[0,2,2,0,0]]`\n        *   +C3: `[[4,4,4,4,0],[3,3,0,0,0],[3,3,0,0,0],[0,2,2,0,0]]`\n    *   Result: `[[4,4,4,4,0],[3,3,0,0,0],[3,3,0,0,0],[0,2,2,0,0]]` (4x5)\n    *   Crop all-white rows/cols: Remove last column (all white). Result: `[[4,4,4,4],[3,3,0,0],[3,3,0,0],[0,2,2,0]]` (4x4). Match!\n*   Let's check T2 with this cropping rule. Mode size 3x4. Output 3x4.\n    *   Contents:\n        *   C1 (4x4): `[[0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]` -> Resize to 3x4 (crop bottom): `[[0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]`\n        *   C2 (3x4): `[[0,0,3,3],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]` -> Resize to 3x4 (no change)\n        *   C3 (3x4): `[[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,0],[0,2,2,0]]` -> Resize to 3x4 (no change)\n        *   C4 (2x4): `[[0,0,0,4],[0,0,0,4]]` -> Resize to 3x4 (pad bottom): `[[0,0,0,4],[0,0,0,4],[0,0,0,0]]`\n    *   Overlay onto 3x4 white grid:\n        *   +C1: `[[0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]`\n        *   +C2: `[[0,0,3,3],[1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]`\n        *   +C3: `[[0,0,3,3],[1,1,2,0],[0,2,2,0]]`\n        *   +C4: `[[0,0,3,4],[1,1,2,4],[0,2,2,0]]`\n    *   Result: `[[0,0,3,3],[1,1,2,4],[0,2,2,0]]` (3x4)\n    *   Crop all-white rows/cols: None to crop. Result matches output. Match!\n*   Let's check T3. Mode size 4x5. Output 4x5.\n    *   Contents:\n        *   C1 (4x5): `[[0,1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0]]` -> Resize 4x5 (no change)\n        *   C2 (4x5): `[[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,2,0],[0,0,0,2,0],[0,0,0,2,0]]` -> Resize 4x5 (no change)\n    *   Overlay onto 4x5 white grid:\n        *   +C1: `[[0,1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0]]`\n        *   +C2: `[[0,1,0,0,0],[1,1,2,2,0],[0,1,1,2,0],[0,0,0,2,0]]`\n    *   Result: `[[0,1,0,0,0],[1,1,2,2,0],[0,1,1,2,0],[0,0,0,2,0]]` (4x5)\n    *   Crop all-white rows/cols: None to crop. Result matches output. Match!\n\n**Final Hypothesis:**\n1.  Find all maximal contiguous rectangular areas of white (0) pixels within the grid border.\n2.  Calculate the height and width of each white rectangle.\n3.  Determine the mode (most frequent) height and mode width from these rectangles.\n4.  Create an intermediate grid of size ModeHeight x ModeWidth, initialized to white (0).\n5.  For each white rectangle found:\n    a. Extract its content grid (pixels from the input grid within the rectangle's bounds).\n    b. Create a temporary grid of size ModeHeight x ModeWidth, initialized to white (0).\n    c. Copy the content grid onto the top-left of the temporary grid, cropping if the content is larger, padding with white (0) if smaller.\n    d. Iterate through the temporary grid. If a pixel `(r, c)` is non-white AND the corresponding intermediate grid pixel `(r, c)` is white (0), set the intermediate grid pixel `(r, c)` to the temporary grid pixel's color.\n6.  Crop the intermediate grid by removing any all-white rows or columns from the outside edges to produce the final output grid.Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input is a large grid (16x16 in these examples) with a single-pixel border of a specific color (blue, azure, or maroon). Inside this border, the grid primarily consists of the border color, but contains distinct rectangular areas filled with white (color 0). Within these white rectangular areas, there are smaller shapes made of other colors (red, green, yellow, blue).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output is a smaller grid. It appears to be a composite image formed by combining the contents found within the white rectangular areas of the input grid.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The task involves identifying specific rectangular sub-regions (the white boxes) within the input, extracting their contents, determining an appropriate output grid size based on the dimensions of these boxes, and then overlaying the extracted contents onto the output grid according to specific rules.\n4.  **Objects & Relationships:**\n    *   **Border:** A frame defining the main area.\n    *   **White Rectangles:** Containers within the border, defined by contiguous white pixels. These are key structural elements.\n    *   **Colored Shapes:** The actual content (payload) located inside the white rectangles. Colors other than white (0) are significant.\n    *   **Overlay:** The process of combining the contents of the white rectangles. White pixels act as transparent, and non-white pixels from different rectangles are combined without overwriting existing non-white pixels.\n    *   **Sizing:** The output grid dimensions seem related to the statistical mode (most common value) of the dimensions of the identified white rectangles.\n    *   **Cropping:** A final cropping step removes any peripheral all-white rows or columns from the combined grid.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
