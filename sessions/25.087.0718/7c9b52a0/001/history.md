The median calculation confirms T2 and T3 but gives 4x5 for T1, where the output is 4x4. My median hypothesis is incorrect for T1.

Let's re-examine T1 and the "most common size" hypothesis.
Sizes: 5x4 (1), 4x5 (2). Most common size is 4x5. Output is 4x4.
Why could it be 4x4?
Perhaps the dimensions are determined independently?
Heights: 5, 4, 4. Most common height = 4.
Widths: 4, 5, 5. Most common width = 5.
This still gives 4x5.

What if the size is determined by the *content* bounding box size, not the white rectangle size?
*   T1 Contents (tight bbox):
    *   Red: `[[2,2]]` -> 1x2
    *   Green: `[[3,3],[3,3]]` -> 2x2
    *   Yellow: `[[4,4,4,4]]` -> 1x4
    *   Sizes: 1x2, 2x2, 1x4. Most common H=1, Most common W=?. Median H=1, Median W=2. Neither gives 4x4.
*   Let's go back to the white rectangles.
    *   T1: 5x4, 4x5, 4x5. Output: 4x4.
    *   T2: 4x4, 3x4, 3x4, 2x4. Output: 3x4.
    *   T3: 4x5, 4x5. Output: 4x5.
*   Could the output size be the size of the *intersection* of all white rectangles? No, they don't overlap.
*   Could the output size be the size of the *smallest* white rectangle?
    *   T1: Smallest area is 5x4=20 or 4x5=20. Ambiguous. Smallest H=4, Smallest W=4. -> 4x4? Match!
    *   T2: Sizes 4x4, 3x4, 3x4, 2x4. Smallest H=2, Smallest W=4. -> 2x4? No, output is 3x4.
    *   T3: Sizes 4x5, 4x5. Smallest H=4, Smallest W=5. -> 4x5? Match!
*   This "Smallest H x Smallest W" hypothesis works for T1 and T3, but not T2.

Let's try "Mode H x Mode W".
*   T1: Heights (5, 4, 4) -> Mode 4. Widths (4, 5, 5) -> Mode 5. Size 4x5. No.
*   T2: Heights (4, 3, 3, 2) -> Mode 3. Widths (4, 4, 4, 4) -> Mode 4. Size 3x4. Match!
*   T3: Heights (4, 4) -> Mode 4. Widths (5, 5) -> Mode 5. Size 4x5. Match!
This "Mode H x Mode W" hypothesis works for T2 and T3. Why does T1 (output 4x4) fail? Its mode size is 4x5. Is there a rule to choose 4x4 instead of 4x5 if the mode is ambiguous or if multiple modes exist? T1 has mode H=4, mode W=5. Output uses mode H, but min W (4) instead of mode W (5)? That seems arbitrary.

What if the resizing/cropping step is key?
Maybe the output grid is always the size of the *first* white rectangle, and subsequent contents are cropped/padded and overlaid?
*   T1: First box 5x4. Output 4x4. No.
*   T2: First box 4x4. Output 3x4. No.
*   T3: First box 4x5. Output 4x5. Match.

Let's reconsider the overlay process and the T1 mismatch (`[[4,4,4,4],[3,3,0,0],[3,3,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]` vs `[[4,4,4,4],[3,3,0,0],[3,3,0,0],[0,2,2,0]]`).
The overlay process where non-white only overwrites white worked. The issue is the size and the cropping/alignment.

Assume the "Mode H x Mode W" size hypothesis is correct (works for T2, T3).
*   T1 Mode Size is 4x5. Output is 4x4.
*   T2 Mode Size is 3x4. Output is 3x4.
*   T3 Mode Size is 4x5. Output is 4x5.

Why is T1 different? Perhaps the final output grid is cropped to remove any all-white rows/columns after the overlay?
*   Overlay result for T1 using 4x5 mode size:
    *   Resize C1 (5x4) to 4x5 (crop bottom row, pad right col): `[[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,2,2,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0]]`
    *   Resize C2 (4x5) to 4x5 (no change): `[[0,0,0,0,0],[3,3,0,0,0],[3,3,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0]]`
    *   Resize C3 (4x5) to 4x5 (no change): `[[4,4,4,4,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0]]`
    *   Overlay onto 4x5 white grid (non-white overwrites only white):
        *   +C1: `[[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,2,2,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0]]`
        *   +C2: `[[0,0,0,0,0],[3,3,0,0,0],[3,3,0,0,0],[0,2,2,0,0]]`
        *   +C3: `[[4,4,4,4,0],[3,3,0,0,0],[3,3,0,0,0],[0,2,2,0,0]]`
    *   Result: `[[4,4,4,4,0],[3,3,0,0,0],[3,3,0,0,0],[0,2,2,0,0]]` (4x5)
    *   Crop all-white rows/cols: Remove last column (all white). Result: `[[4,4,4,4],[3,3,0,0],[3,3,0,0],[0,2,2,0]]` (4x4). Match!
*   Let's check T2 with this cropping rule. Mode size 3x4. Output 3x4.
    *   Contents:
        *   C1 (4x4): `[[0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]` -> Resize to 3x4 (crop bottom): `[[0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]`
        *   C2 (3x4): `[[0,0,3,3],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]` -> Resize to 3x4 (no change)
        *   C3 (3x4): `[[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,0],[0,2,2,0]]` -> Resize to 3x4 (no change)
        *   C4 (2x4): `[[0,0,0,4],[0,0,0,4]]` -> Resize to 3x4 (pad bottom): `[[0,0,0,4],[0,0,0,4],[0,0,0,0]]`
    *   Overlay onto 3x4 white grid:
        *   +C1: `[[0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]`
        *   +C2: `[[0,0,3,3],[1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]`
        *   +C3: `[[0,0,3,3],[1,1,2,0],[0,2,2,0]]`
        *   +C4: `[[0,0,3,4],[1,1,2,4],[0,2,2,0]]`
    *   Result: `[[0,0,3,3],[1,1,2,4],[0,2,2,0]]` (3x4)
    *   Crop all-white rows/cols: None to crop. Result matches output. Match!
*   Let's check T3. Mode size 4x5. Output 4x5.
    *   Contents:
        *   C1 (4x5): `[[0,1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0]]` -> Resize 4x5 (no change)
        *   C2 (4x5): `[[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,2,0],[0,0,0,2,0],[0,0,0,2,0]]` -> Resize 4x5 (no change)

    *   Crop all-white rows/cols: None to crop. Result matches output. Match!

**Final Hypothesis:**
1.  Find all maximal contiguous rectangular areas of white (0) pixels within the grid border.
2.  Calculate the height and width of each white rectangle.
3.  Determine the mode (most frequent) height and mode width from these rectangles.
4.  Create an intermediate grid of size ModeHeight x ModeWidth, initialized to white (0).
5.  For each white rectangle found:
    a. Extract its content grid (pixels from the input grid within the rectangle's bounds).
    b. Create a temporary grid of size ModeHeight x ModeWidth, initialized to white (0).
    c. Copy the content grid onto the top-left of the temporary grid, cropping if the content is larger, padding with white (0) if smaller.
    d. Iterate through the temporary grid. If a pixel `(r, c)` is non-white AND the corresponding intermediate grid pixel `(r, c)` is white (0), set the intermediate grid pixel `(r, c)` to the temporary grid pixel's color.
6.  Crop the intermediate grid by removing any all-white rows or columns from the outside edges to produce the final output grid.Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input is a large grid (16x16 in these examples) with a single-pixel border of a specific color (blue, azure, or maroon). Inside this border, the grid primarily consists of the border color, but contains distinct rectangular areas filled with white (color 0). Within these white rectangular areas, there are smaller shapes made of other colors (red, green, yellow, blue).
2.  **Output Structure:** The output is a smaller grid. It appears to be a composite image formed by combining the contents found within the white rectangular areas of the input grid.
3.  **Core Transformation:** The task involves identifying specific rectangular sub-regions (the white boxes) within the input, extracting their contents, determining an appropriate output grid size based on the dimensions of these boxes, and then overlaying the extracted contents onto the output grid according to specific rules.
4.  **Objects & Relationships:**
    *   **Border:** A frame defining the main area.
    *   **White Rectangles:** Containers within the border, defined by contiguous white pixels. These are key structural elements.
    *   **Colored Shapes:** The actual content (payload) located inside the white rectangles. Colors other than white (0) are significant.
    *   **Overlay:** The process of combining the contents of the white rectangles. White pixels act as transparent, and non-white pixels from different rectangles are combined without overwriting existing non-white pixels.
    *   **Sizing:** The output grid dimensions seem related to the statistical mode (most common value) of the dimensions of the identified white rectangles.
    *   **Cropping:** A final cropping step removes any peripheral all-white rows or columns from the combined grid.

    - size: Determined by transformation rule (Mode Height x Mode Width of White_Rectangles, then cropped)
  Content:
    - Composite image formed by overlaying the contents of the input White_Rectangles.

Transformation:
  Steps:
    - 1: Identify all White_Rectangles within the input grid border.
    - 2: Record the height and width of each White_Rectangle.
    - 3: Calculate Mode_Height (most frequent height) and Mode_Width (most frequent width).
    - 4: Create an intermediate grid of size Mode_Height x Mode_Width, filled with white (0).
    - 5: For each White_Rectangle:
        - a: Extract its content grid (pixels from input within its bounds).
        - b: Create a temporary grid (Mode_Height x Mode_Width), filled with white (0).
        - c: Copy/crop/pad the content grid onto the top-left of the temporary grid.
        - d: Overlay the temporary grid onto the intermediate grid: copy non-white pixels from temporary to intermediate *only if* the corresponding intermediate pixel is white (0).
    - 6: Crop the intermediate grid: remove all-white rows/columns from the border inwards.
    - 7: Result is the final Output_Grid.
  Key_Rules:
    - White (0) pixels act as transparent during overlay.
    - Non-white pixels only overwrite white pixels during overlay.
    - Output size determined by mode dimensions of White_Rectangles, followed by cropping.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all distinct, maximal rectangular blocks composed entirely of white pixels that are located inside the single-pixel outer border of the input grid.
2.  For each identified white rectangle, determine its height and width.
3.  Find the most common height (Mode Height) and the most common width (Mode Width) among all identified white rectangles.
4.  Prepare an intermediate canvas grid with dimensions Mode Height x Mode Width, initially filled entirely with white pixels.
5.  Iterate through each identified white rectangle from the input grid:
    a. Extract the content of this white rectangle from the input grid (this includes any colored shapes and the white background within its bounds).
    b. Create a temporary grid, also of size Mode Height x Mode Width, filled with white pixels.
    c. Place the extracted content onto the top-left corner of this temporary grid. If the content is larger than Mode Height x Mode Width, crop it from the bottom and right. If it's smaller, pad the temporary grid with the default white pixels.
    d. Compare the temporary grid pixel by pixel with the intermediate canvas grid. For each position (row, column), if the pixel in the temporary grid is *not* white AND the corresponding pixel in the intermediate canvas grid *is* white, update the pixel in the intermediate canvas grid to the color from the temporary grid.
6.  After processing all white rectangles, inspect the resulting intermediate canvas grid. Remove any rows from the top and bottom edges that consist entirely of white pixels. Similarly, remove any columns from the left and right edges that consist entirely of white pixels.
7.  The final cropped grid is the output.
