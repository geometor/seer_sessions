"""
Transforms an input grid based on identifying internal rectangular content areas, 
determining a target size based on the mode dimensions of these areas, 
overlaying the contents of these areas onto a target-sized canvas, and finally 
cropping any surrounding whitespace (color 0).

1.  Determine the border color (assumed to be the color of the top-left pixel).
2.  Identify all distinct, maximal rectangular blocks composed of non-border 
    colors that are located fully inside the single-pixel outer border of the 
    input grid.
3.  For each identified content rectangle, determine its height and width.
4.  Find the most common height (Mode Height) and the most common width 
    (Mode Width) among all identified content rectangles.
5.  Prepare an intermediate canvas grid with dimensions Mode Height x Mode Width, 
    initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
6.  Iterate through each identified content rectangle from the input grid:
    a. Extract the content grid (pixels from the input grid within the 
       rectangle's bounds).
    b. Create a temporary grid, also of size Mode Height x Mode Width, filled 
       with white pixels (0).
    c. Place the extracted content onto the top-left corner of this temporary 
       grid. Crop the content if it's larger than Mode Height x Mode Width; 
       pad with white if it's smaller.
    d. Overlay the temporary grid onto the intermediate canvas grid: For each 
       pixel, if the temporary grid pixel is non-white (not 0) AND the corresponding 
       intermediate canvas pixel IS white (0), update the intermediate canvas pixel 
       to the temporary grid pixel's color. (This prevents overwriting existing 
       non-white content with other non-white content, only fills in the white 
       background).
7.  After processing all content rectangles, crop the intermediate canvas grid by 
    removing any all-white (0) rows or columns from the outside edges inwards.
8.  Return the final cropped grid.
