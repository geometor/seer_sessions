There are also one or more red objects located somewhere below these initial azure lines. The background is white. The output grids show that the azure lines have been extended downwards from their initial position. This extension continues until the bottom of the grid, *unless* the extension encounters a red pixel in the same column. If a red pixel is encountered, the azure extension stops *at that row*, effectively overwriting any white pixels above the red pixel in that column but not overwriting the red pixel itself or extending below it. Columns without red pixels below the initial azure lines are extended all the way to the bottom row.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
