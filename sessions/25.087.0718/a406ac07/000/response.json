            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 10x10 grids. The input grids consist mostly of a white background (color 0).\n2.  **Input Features:** The defining features of the input grids are the rightmost column (index 9) and the bottom row (index 9). These contain sequences of colors other than white. The rest of the grid (indices 0-8 for both rows and columns) is white.\n3.  **Color Correspondence:** There appears to be a direct correspondence between the colors and their positions in the rightmost column (read top-to-bottom) and the bottom row (read left-to-right). The sequence of colors is identical in both.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the original rightmost column and bottom row from the input. Additionally, rectangular blocks of color are drawn within the top-left 9x9 subgrid.\n5.  **Block Formation:** Each distinct color present in the input's boundary (right column and bottom row) forms a single rectangular block in the output's 9x9 area.\n6.  **Block Positioning and Sizing:** The position and size of each colored block in the output are determined by the range of indices occupied by that color in the input's right column and bottom row.\n    *   The top row of a block corresponds to the minimum row index of that color in the input's right column.\n    *   The bottom row of a block corresponds to the maximum row index of that color in the input's right column.\n    *   The leftmost column of a block corresponds to the minimum column index of that color in the input's bottom row.\n    *   The rightmost column of a block corresponds to the maximum column index of that color in the input's bottom row.\n7.  **Background:** The parts of the output's 9x9 subgrid not covered by these colored blocks remain white (0).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
