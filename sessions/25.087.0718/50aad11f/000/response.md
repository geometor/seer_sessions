## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain a white background (color 0), several objects composed of magenta pixels (color 6), and one or more single pixels of other colors (acting as "markers").
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are smaller than the inputs. They contain objects whose colors correspond to the marker colors from the input, arranged horizontally. The background is white (color 0).
3.  **Core Transformation:** The task involves identifying the magenta objects in the input, associating each magenta object with a nearby marker pixel, extracting the pattern of each magenta object, recoloring the pattern according to its associated marker's color, and arranging these recolored patterns horizontally in the output grid.
4.  **Object Identification:** Magenta objects are connected components of color 6. Marker objects are single, isolated pixels of colors other than 0 or 6.
5.  **Association Rule:** Each marker pixel is associated with the "closest" magenta object. Closeness likely refers to the geometric distance between the marker pixel's coordinates and the coordinates of the pixels belonging to a magenta object. In the examples, each marker seems uniquely associated with one magenta object.
6.  **Pattern Extraction:** For each associated magenta object, its pattern is defined by the contents of its minimal bounding box. All example magenta objects seem to fit within a 4x4 bounding box.
7.  **Recoloring:** Within the extracted pattern (bounding box), magenta pixels (6) are replaced with the color of the associated marker pixel. Background pixels (0) remain unchanged.
8.  **Output Arrangement:** The recolored patterns (derived from marker-magenta pairs) are placed side-by-side in the output grid. The horizontal order of these patterns corresponds to the horizontal order (left-to-right, based on column index) of their associated marker pixels in the input grid.
9.  **Output Dimensions:** The height of the output grid seems fixed by the height of the extracted patterns (consistently 4 in the examples). The width is the sum of the widths of the extracted patterns (consistently 4 times the number of markers).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid to find all single pixels that are not white (0) or magenta (6). Record the color and (row, column) position of each such pixel; these are the "markers".
2.  Identify all distinct connected objects composed of magenta (6) pixels.
3.  For each marker, determine the magenta object that is geometrically closest to it (e.g., based on the minimum Euclidean distance between the marker's position and any pixel belonging to the magenta object). Create pairs of (marker, associated magenta object).
4.  For each (marker, associated magenta object) pair:
    a.  Determine the minimal bounding box containing the associated magenta object.
    b.  Extract the grid pattern within this bounding box.
    c.  Create a new pattern grid of the same dimensions by replacing all magenta (6) pixels in the extracted pattern with the color of the marker. Leave white (0) pixels unchanged. Store this recolored pattern along with the original marker's column index.
5.  Sort the generated (recolored pattern, marker column index) pairs based on the marker column index in ascending order (left-to-right).
6.  Determine the dimensions of the output grid: the height will be the height of the (first) recolored pattern, and the width will be the sum of the widths of all recolored patterns.
7.  Construct the final output grid by concatenating the sorted recolored patterns horizontally, placing them side-by-side in the determined order. Fill any remaining space with the background color (white, 0), although construction by concatenation should fill the grid precisely if all patterns have the same height.
