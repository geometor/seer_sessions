task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with colors 0-9.
  - element: background
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - role: occupies empty space in both input and output.
  - element: primary_objects
    properties:
      - color: magenta (6)
      - shape: variable, connected components
      - role: represent patterns to be extracted and transformed.
      - location: scattered within the input grid.
  - element: marker_objects
    properties:
      - color: varies (e.g., blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), azure (8))
      - shape: single pixel
      - role: select a corresponding primary_object and determine its output color.
      - location: specific single coordinates within the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_proximity
    description: Each marker_object is associated with the closest primary_object (magenta shape).
  - type: ordering
    description: The horizontal position (column index) of marker_objects in the input determines the horizontal arrangement of the transformed patterns in the output.

actions:
  - action: identify_markers
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list of (color, position) for each marker pixel.
  - action: identify_magenta_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list of magenta objects (sets of coordinates or bounding boxes).
  - action: associate_markers_objects
    inputs: markers, magenta_objects
    outputs: list of (marker, associated_magenta_object) pairs, based on proximity.
  - action: extract_pattern
    inputs: associated_magenta_object
    outputs: pattern_grid (content of the object's minimal bounding box).
  - action: recolor_pattern
    inputs: pattern_grid, marker_color
    outputs: recolored_pattern_grid (magenta pixels replaced by marker color).
  - action: arrange_patterns
    inputs: list of (recolored_pattern_grid, marker_position) sorted by marker column index
    outputs: final_output_grid (patterns placed horizontally side-by-side).

properties:
  - property: output_dimensions
    value:
      - height: determined by the height of the extracted patterns (e.g., 4).
      - width: sum of the widths of the extracted patterns (e.g., 4 * number of markers).
