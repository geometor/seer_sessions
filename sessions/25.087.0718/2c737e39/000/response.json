            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid contains various colored pixels on a white background. Critically, there are always exactly two gray (5) pixels present.\n2.  **Objects:** There appears to be one primary \"source\" object composed of connected non-white pixels. One of the gray pixels is part of this source object. The second gray pixel is always isolated, acting as a single-pixel \"target marker\" object.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a copy-and-translate operation. The source object (excluding its internal gray pixel) is copied.\n4.  **Translation Vector:** The translation is determined by the relative positions of the two gray pixels. The gray pixel *within* the source object acts as an \"anchor point,\" and the isolated gray pixel acts as the \"target point.\" The copy is placed such that where the anchor point *was*, the target point *now is*.\n5.  **Output Structure:** The output grid contains the original source object unchanged. It also contains the translated copy of the source object's non-gray pixels. The isolated gray target marker pixel from the input is overwritten, either by a pixel from the copied object or by the background color (white) if no part of the copied object lands on its position.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Use connectivity analysis (considering adjacent non-white pixels, including diagonals if necessary, although side-adjacency seems sufficient based on examples) to distinguish them.\n3.  **Calculate Offset:** Compute the row and column difference needed to move from the anchor point's coordinates to the target point's coordinates. This is the translation vector (`offset = target_point - anchor_point`).\n4.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid identical to the input grid. This will be modified to become the output grid.\n5.  **Clear Target Marker:** In the new grid, change the color of the pixel at the target point's coordinates to white (0).\n6.  **Copy Source Object (excluding anchor):** Iterate through every pixel belonging to the identified source object.\n7.  **Translate and Draw:** For each pixel from the source object *that is not the gray anchor point pixel*:\n    a.  Calculate its destination coordinates by adding the translation vector (from step 3) to its original coordinates.\n    b.  Check if the calculated destination coordinates are within the bounds of the grid.\n    c.  If they are within bounds, update the pixel at the destination coordinates in the new grid with the color of the current source object pixel. This will overwrite any existing pixel, including the white pixel potentially placed in step 5.\n8.  **Final Output:** The modified grid is the final output."
