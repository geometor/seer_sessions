"""
Recolors azure (8) regions in the input grid based on a color palette derived from vertical lines and the sequential discovery of azure regions from left-to-right.

1.  **Extract Color Palette:** Scan odd-numbered columns (1, 3, 5...) left-to-right. For each column, find the first non-white (0), non-azure (8) color scanning top-down. Add this color to an ordered palette. Stop scanning odd columns if an odd column contains an azure pixel or is entirely white.
2.  **Identify All Azure Pixels:** Create a set containing the coordinates (row, col) of all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
4.  **Sequential Coloring using Palette:** Iterate through the colors in the extracted palette in order. For each color:
    a.  Check if there are any remaining azure pixel coordinates. If not, stop processing the palette.
    b.  Find the "seed" pixel among the remaining azure coordinates: the one with the minimum column index. If there's a tie for minimum column index, choose the one with the minimum row index.
    c.  Perform a flood fill (Breadth-First Search using 8-way connectivity - horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) starting from the seed pixel. The flood fill should only visit pixels whose coordinates are in the set of remaining azure coordinates. Collect all coordinates visited by this flood fill.
    d.  Color the pixels in the output grid at the collected coordinates using the current palette color.
    e.  Remove the collected coordinates from the set of remaining azure coordinates.
5.  **Return Result:** Return the modified output grid.
