The azure pixels are replaced; the white background remains.\n    *   The core transformation involves using the colors from the vertical lines on the left to \"paint\" the azure shapes on the right.\n    *   The key challenge is determining the mapping rule: which line color corresponds to which azure shape. Observing the examples reveals a consistent pattern: the Nth vertical line (reading from left to right) provides the color for the Nth azure shape (reading from left to right).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Scan the input grid's odd-numbered columns (1, 3, 5, ...) from left to right. Identify the non-white color present in each of these columns and store these colors in an ordered list (e.g., `color_palette`). The first color found corresponds to the first element, the second color to the second, and so on.\n    3.  Identify all distinct contiguous regions (shapes) composed of azure pixels (8) in the input grid.\n    4.  Determine the spatial order of these azure shapes from left to right. This can be done by finding the minimum column index (leftmost point) for each shape and sorting the shapes based on this index. Store the shapes (represented by their pixel coordinates) in an ordered list (`target_shapes`).\n    5.  Iterate through the `target_shapes` list using an index `i` (starting from 0). For each shape `target_shapes[i]`:\n        a.  Retrieve the corresponding color from the `color_palette` list using the same index: `paint_color = color_palette[i]`.\n        b.  For every pixel coordinate `(row, col)` belonging to `target_shapes[i]`, set the pixel at `(row, col)` in the output grid to `paint_color`.\n    6.  The final output grid is the result of these painting operations."
