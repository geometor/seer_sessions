*   Analysis of Example 1 Diff: The code colored Component B (min_col 12) with yellow (4) instead of the expected green (3). Why? The code applies `palette[1]` (green=3) to the component with the *second* smallest `min_col`.
    *   Palette: `[4, 3, 2]`
    *   Components (by min_col): A (8), B (12), C (15)
    *   Code mapping: A -> palette[0] = 4, B -> palette[1] = 3, C -> palette[2] = 2
    *   Expected mapping: A -> 4, B -> 3, C -> 2
    *   My analysis of the code output was wrong. The provided `Transformed Output` in the prompt *is* incorrect. Let me re-run the code locally if possible or trust the prompt's output. Okay, I'll trust the prompt's output.
    *   The `Transformed Output` provided in the prompt shows Component B coloured 4 (yellow) and Component C coloured 3 (green).
    *   Prompt's Transformed: A -> 4, B -> 4, C -> 3
    *   Expected: A -> 4, B -> 3, C -> 2
    *   The code seems to be applying the palette incorrectly, maybe reusing colors or getting the order wrong. Let's re-read the code `transform` function.
        
```python
        num_colors = len(color_palette)
        for i, component_coords in enumerate(ordered_components):
            if i < num_colors:
                paint_color = color_palette[i] # Seems correct: ith component gets ith color
                for r, c in component_coords:
                    output_grid[r, c] = paint_color
            else:
                break
        ```

    *   The component finding and sorting seems okay. The palette extraction seems okay (`[4, 3, 2]`). The application loop seems okay.
    *   Is it possible the `find_azure_components` is merging components incorrectly or ordering them wrong? Let's re-trace Example 1:
        *   Comp A: min_col 8.
        *   Comp B: min_col 12.
        *   Comp C: min_col 15.
        *   Sorted Order: A, B, C.
        *   Palette: `[4, 3, 2]`
        *   Code should paint: A=4, B=3, C=2.
    *   The Transformed Output provided in the prompt *cannot* be generated by the code provided, assuming the component finder and palette extractor work as described. The prompt's transformed output shows Comp B = 4 and Comp C = 3. This suggests either the palette was `[4, 4, 3]` or the components were mapped `A->0, B->0, C->1`. Neither makes sense with the code.
    *   Let's assume the code *did* produce the Expected Output for Example 1, but failed on 2 and 3. Or maybe the bug is subtler. What if the palette extraction is wrong?
        *   `get_color_palette`: Scan odd columns (1, 3, 5...). Find first non-white, non-azure pixel top-down. Stop if azure found or column is all white.
            *   Ex 1: Col 1 -> 4. Col 3 -> 3. Col 5 -> 2. Col 7 -> all white. Stop. Palette: `[4, 3, 2]`. Seems correct.
        *   `find_azure_components`: BFS for 8-connectivity azure pixels. Sort components by min_col.
            *   Ex 1: Comps A (min 8), B (min 12), C (min 15). Seems correct.
        *   `transform`: Paint `i`-th component with `i`-th palette color.
            *   Ex 1: A -> 4, B -> 3, C -> 2. This matches the EXPECTED output.
    *   Conclusion for Example 1: The provided `Transformed Output` in the prompt seems inconsistent with the provided code's logic. The code's logic *should* produce the `Expected Output` for Example 1. The discrepancy reported ("Pixels Off: 24") must stem from this inconsistency. Let's re-evaluate based on the *Expected* output being the target. The code logic *seems* correct for Example 1.

*   **Example 2 Failure:**
    *   Input Palette Source: Col 1 (blue), Col 3 (magenta), Col 5 (orange). Col 7 is all white. Stop. Palette: `[1, 6, 7]`.
    *   Azure Components (by min_col):
        *   Comp A: ((0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9)) - min_col 7
        *   Comp B: ((2,10), (3,10), (4,10), (5,10), (2,11), (3,11), (4,11), (5,11)) - min_col 10
        *   Comp C: ((0,12), (0,13), (0,14), (1,12), (1,13), (1,14), (2,12), (2,13), (2,14)) - min_col 12
    *   Order: A, B, C.
    *   Expected Mapping: Comp A -> 1 (blue), Comp B -> 6 (magenta), Comp C -> 7 (orange).
    *   Code Logic Mapping: Comp A -> palette[0]=1, Comp B -> palette[1]=6, Comp C -> palette[2]=7.
    *   The code logic produces the *Expected* output for Example 2 as well.
    *   The `Transformed Output` provided in the prompt shows: A=1, B=1, C=1. This is wrong. Palette seems to be `[1, 1, 1]`. Why? Let's check `get_color_palette` again.
        *   Col 1: First non-white/non-azure is 1 (blue). Palette = `[1]`
        *   Col 3: First non-white/non-azure is 6 (magenta). Palette = `[1, 6]`
        *   Col 5: First non-white/non-azure is 7 (orange). Palette = `[1, 6, 7]`
        *   Col 7: Contains azure (8). Stop. Palette = `[1, 6, 7]`.
    *   The palette extraction logic seems correct. The `Transformed Output` in the prompt (`A=1, B=1, C=1`) is again inconsistent with the code logic.

*   **Example 3 Failure:**
    *   Input Palette Source: Col 1 (green), Col 3 (red), Col 5 (yellow), Col 7 (orange). Col 9 contains azure. Stop. Palette: `[3, 2, 4, 7]`.
    *   Azure Components (by min_col):
        *   Comp A: ((0,9), (0,10), (1,9), (1,10), (1,11), (1,12), (2,11), (2,12), (3,11), (3,12)) - min_col 9
        *   Comp B: ((0,14), (0,15), (1,14), (1,15), (2,14), (2,15), (3,14), (3,15), (3,16), (3,17), (4,14), (4,15), (4,16), (4,17), (5,16), (5,17)) - min_col 14
    *   Order: A, B. (Note: there seem to be only two distinct azure components in the input visually). Let's check carefully.
        *   Yes, (0,9) connects diagonally to (1,10), which connects to (1,11) etc. It forms one large L-shape.
        *   The second component starts at (0,14).
    *   Let me re-run the component finding mentally:
        *   Start at (0,9). Neighbors: (0,10), (1,9), (1,10). -> Add (0,10), (1,9), (1,10) to queue.
        *   Visit (0,10). Neighbors: (0,9), (1,9), (1,10), (1,11). -> Add (1,11) to queue.
        *   Visit (1,9). Neighbors: (0,9), (0,10), (1,10), (2,10)-no, (2,9)-no. -> Nothing new.
        *   Visit (1,10). Neighbors: (0,9), (0,10), (0,11)-no, (1,9), (1,11), (2,9)-no, (2,10)-no, (2,11). -> Add (2,11).
        *   Visit (1,11). Neighbors: (0,10), (0,12)-no, (1,10), (1,12), (2,10)-no, (2,11), (2,12). -> Add (1,12), (2,12).
        *   Visit (2,11). Neighbors: (1,10), (1,11), (1,12), (2,10)-no, (2,12), (3,10)-no, (3,11), (3,12). -> Add (3,11), (3,12).
        *   Visit (1,12). Neighbors: (0,11)-no, (1,11), (1,13)-no, (2,11), (2,12), (2,13)-no. -> Nothing new.
        *   Visit (2,12). Neighbors: (1,11), (1,12), (1,13)-no, (2,11), (2,13)-no, (3,11), (3,12), (3,13)-no. -> Nothing new.
        *   Visit (3,11). Neighbors: (2,10)-no, (2,11), (2,12), (3,10)-no, (3,12), (4,10)-no, (4,11)-no, (4,12)-no. -> Nothing new.
        *   Visit (3,12). Neighbors: (2,11), (2,12), (2,13)-no, (3,11), (3,13)-no, (4,11)-no, (4,12)-no, (4,13)-no. -> Nothing new.
        *   Component A coords: {(0,9), (0,10), (1,9), (1,10), (1,11), (1,12), (2,11), (2,12), (3,11), (3,12)}. Min_col = 9.
        *   Start new search at (0,14).
        *   ... (This will find the second component) Coords: {(0,14), (0,15), (1,14), (1,15), (2,14), (2,15), (3,14), (3,15), (3,16), (3,17), (4,14), (4,15), (4,16), (4,17), (5,16), (5,17)}. Min_col = 14.
    *   Order: A, B.
    *   Palette: `[3, 2, 4, 7]`.
    *   Expected Mapping: Comp A -> 3 (green), Comp B -> 2 (red). Wait, the expected output uses more colors.
        *   Expected Output breakdown:
            *   Color 3 (green) at positions corresponding to A.
            *   Color 2 (red) at positions corresponding to the top-left part of B: {(1,14),(1,15),(2,14),(2,15),(3,14),(3,15)}? No, seems to be {(1,11),(1,12),(2,11),(2,12),(3,11),(3,12)} which are part of component A in the *input*. This is confusing.
            *   Let's re-examine Expected Output 3 carefully.
                *   Green (3) pixels: (0,9), (0,10), (1,9), (1,10). Min_col=9. This is the top part of input Comp A.
                *   Red (2) pixels: (1,11), (1,12), (2,11), (2,12), (3,11), (3,12). Min_col=11. This is the bottom part of input Comp A.
                *   Yellow (4) pixels: (0,14), (0,15), (1,14), (1,15), (2,14), (2,15), (3,14), (3,15), (4,14), (4,15). Min_col=14. This is the left part of input Comp B.
                *   Orange (7) pixels: (3,16), (3,17), (4,16), (4,17), (5,16), (5,17). Min_col=16. This is the right part of input Comp B.
    *   Hypothesis: The rule isn't about coloring the entire input azure components. It seems the *output* objects are derived from the *input* azure shapes, but might be split differently based on the palette colors. The number of output objects seems to match the number of palette colors.
    *   Let's revisit Example 1 with this idea.
        *   Palette: `[4, 3, 2]` (Yellow, Green, Red)
        *   Input Azure Components: A (min 8), B (min 12), C (min 15)
        *   Expected Output Objects (based on color):
            *   Obj 1 (Yellow): Corresponds exactly to Input Comp A. Min_col 8.
            *   Obj 2 (Green): Corresponds exactly to Input Comp B. Min_col 12.
            *   Obj 3 (Red): Corresponds exactly to Input Comp C. Min_col 15.
        *   Okay, so for Example 1, the mapping is 1:1 between input azure components and output colored objects, ordered by min_col.
    *   Example 2:
        *   Palette: `[1, 6, 7]` (Blue, Magenta, Orange)
        *   Input Azure Components: A (min 7), B (min 10), C (min 12)
        *   Expected Output Objects:
            *   Obj 1 (Blue): Corresponds exactly to Input Comp A. Min_col 7.
            *   Obj 2 (Magenta): Corresponds exactly to Input Comp B. Min_col 10.
            *   Obj 3 (Orange): Corresponds exactly to Input Comp C. Min_col 12.
        *   Again, 1:1 mapping ordered by min_col.
    *   Example 3:
        *   Palette: `[3, 2, 4, 7]` (Green, Red, Yellow, Orange)
        *   Input Azure Components: A (min 9), B (min 14)
        *   Expected Output Objects:
            *   Obj 1 (Green): Top part of Input Comp A. Min_col 9.
            *   Obj 2 (Red): Bottom part of Input Comp A. Min_col 11.
            *   Obj 3 (Yellow): Left part of Input Comp B. Min_col 14.
            *   Obj 4 (Orange): Right part of Input Comp B. Min_col 16.
    *   Okay, the pattern is emerging:
        1.  Extract the color palette `P` from odd columns as before. `P = [c1, c2, ..., cn]`
        2.  Find *all* azure pixels in the input. Let this set be `AzureCoords`.
        3.  Initialize the output grid to white.
        4.  Iterate through the palette colors `ci` from `i = 0` to `n-1`.
        5.  For the current color `ci`, find the connected component of azure pixels within `AzureCoords` that has the overall minimum column index. Let this component be `Comp_i`.
        6.  Color all pixels of `Comp_i` in the output grid with color `ci`.
        7.  Remove the coordinates of `Comp_i` from `AzureCoords`.
        8.  Repeat steps 5-7 until the palette is exhausted or `AzureCoords` is empty.

    *   Let's trace Example 3 with this new logic:
        *   Palette `P = [3, 2, 4, 7]`.
        *   `AzureCoords` = All azure pixels from input.
        *   `i=0`, color `c0 = 3` (Green).
            *   Find component in `AzureCoords` with minimum `min_col`. The overall min_col is 9 (from pixel (0,9)).
            *   The component connected to (0,9) using only pixels currently in `AzureCoords` is Input Comp A: {(0,9), (0,10), (1,9), (1,10), (1,11), (1,12), (2,11), (2,12), (3,11), (3,12)}. Let's call this `CurrentComp`. Min_col is 9.
            *   Wait, the rule isn't "find the component with the minimum column index". The expected output splits Input Comp A.
            *   Let's reconsider the relationship between palette colors and output objects in Ex 3.
                *   Palette: `[3, 2, 4, 7]`
                *   Output Objects (ordered by palette): Green (min 9), Red (min 11), Yellow (min 14), Orange (min 16).
                *   The min_col of the output objects increases.
            *   Maybe the rule is:
                1. Get palette `P = [c1, c2, ..., cn]`.
                2. Find all input azure components `InputComps`, sorted by `min_col`. `InputComps = [CompA, CompB, ...]`.
                3. Create a mapping. How many palette colors per input component?
                   * Ex1: 3 colors, 3 components. 1:1 mapping.
                   * Ex2: 3 colors, 3 components. 1:1 mapping.
                   * Ex3: 4 colors, 2 components. How to map? Maybe the mapping depends on the *relative size* or some other property? No, that seems too complex.
                   * What if the "objects" being colored aren't the pre-identified azure components, but rather sub-parts determined sequentially?

            *   Let's refine the sequential idea:
                1.  Extract palette `P = [c1, c2, ..., cn]`.
                2.  Maintain a set of `RemainingAzureCoords` = all azure pixels from input.
                3.  Initialize output grid.
                4.  For `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
                    a.  Find the pixel `(r, c)` in `RemainingAzureCoords` with the minimum column index `c`. If there are ties, pick the one with the minimum row index `r`. Let this be `seed_pixel`.
                    b.  Perform a flood fill (BFS/DFS using 8-connectivity) starting from `seed_pixel`, only visiting pixels that are in `RemainingAzureCoords`. Let the set of found pixels be `CurrentComponentPixels`.
                    c.  Color all pixels in `CurrentComponentPixels` in the output grid with `P[i]`.
                    d.  Remove `CurrentComponentPixels` from `RemainingAzureCoords`.
                5.  Return output grid.

            *   Let's trace Example 3 with *this* logic:
                *   Palette `P = [3, 2, 4, 7]`.
                *   `RemainingAzureCoords` = All azure pixels.
                *   Output grid = all white.
                *   `i = 0`, color `c0 = 3` (Green).
                    *   Min `c` in `RemainingAzureCoords` is 9 (pixels (0,9), (1,9)). Min `r` among these is 0. `seed_pixel = (0,9)`.
                    *   Flood fill from (0,9) within `RemainingAzureCoords`: This finds all pixels of Input Comp A: {(0,9), (0,10), (1,9), (1,10), (1,11), (1,12), (2,11), (2,12), (3,11), (3,12)}. Let this be `CurrentComponentPixels`.
                    *   Color these pixels green (3) in the output grid.
                    *   Remove these pixels from `RemainingAzureCoords`.
                *   `i = 1`, color `c1 = 2` (Red).
                    *   Min `c` in `RemainingAzureCoords` is now 14 (pixels (0,14), (1,14), ...). Min `r` is 0. `seed_pixel = (0,14)`.
                    *   Flood fill from (0,14) within `RemainingAzureCoords`: This finds all pixels of Input Comp B: {(0,14), (0,15), ..., (5,17)}. Let this be `CurrentComponentPixels`.
                    *   Color these pixels red (2) in the output grid.
                    *   Remove these pixels from `RemainingAzureCoords`.
                *   `i = 2`, color `c2 = 4` (Yellow). `RemainingAzureCoords` is empty. Stop.
                *   Resulting Output: Comp A is Green, Comp B is Red. This *still* doesn't match Expected Output 3.

            *   What did I miss in the expected output for Ex 3?
                *   Green: {(0,9), (0,10), (1,9), (1,10)}
                *   Red: {(1,11), (1,12), (2,11), (2,12), (3,11), (3,12)}
                *   Yellow: {(0,14), (0,15), (1,14), (1,15), (2,14), (2,15), (3,14), (3,15), (4,14), (4,15)}
                *   Orange: {(3,16), (3,17), (4,16), (4,17), (5,16), (5,17)}
                *   These four sets are disjoint, and their union is exactly the set of all input azure pixels.
                *   They seem to be four distinct connected components *if* you consider connectivity based on the final colors.
                *   Ordering seems based on min_col: Green (9), Red (11), Yellow (14), Orange (16). This matches the palette order `[3, 2, 4, 7]`.

            *   How are these components identified? They are *not* the components found by BFS on the original azure pixels starting from the min-col seed.
            *   Maybe the definition of "component" is different? Or the starting point?
            *   Look at the palette source columns again:
                *   Col 1: Green (3)
                *   Col 3: Red (2)
                *   Col 5: Yellow (4)
                *   Col 7: Orange (7)
            *   Look at the output objects again:
                *   Green Obj (min_col 9)
                *   Red Obj (min_col 11)
                *   Yellow Obj (min_col 14)
                *   Orange Obj (min_col 16)

            *   There's a spatial relationship. The colors are applied left-to-right based on the palette order, and they seem to 'claim' the leftmost available azure pixels.

            *   Revised Hypothesis 3:
                1.  Extract palette `P = [c1, c2, ..., cn]` from odd columns.
                2.  Find the set of all azure pixel coordinates `AzureCoords` in the input.
                3.  Initialize output grid to white.
                4.  For `i` from 0 to `n-1` (iterate through palette colors):
                    a.  If `AzureCoords` is empty, stop.
                    b.  Find the pixel `(r, c)` in `AzureCoords` that has the minimum column index `c`. If ties, use the minimum row index `r`. Let this be `seed_pixel`.
                    c.  Perform a flood fill (BFS/DFS using 8-connectivity) starting from `seed_pixel`, visiting only pixels that are in `AzureCoords`. Let the found set be `CurrentComponentPixels`.
                    d.  Assign color `P[i]` to all pixels in `CurrentComponentPixels` in the output grid.
                    e.  Remove `CurrentComponentPixels` from `AzureCoords`.
                5.  Return output grid.

            *   Let's re-trace Example 3 with Hypothesis 3:
                *   Palette `P = [3, 2, 4, 7]`.
                *   `AzureCoords` = All azure pixels.
                *   Output grid = white.
                *   `i = 0`, Color `c0 = 3` (Green).
                    *   Seed pixel (min col, then min row in `AzureCoords`) = (0, 9).
                    *   BFS from (0,9) within `AzureCoords` finds Input Component A = {(0,9)...(3,12)}. Let this be `CompA_Pixels`.
                    *   Paint `CompA_Pixels` Green (3) in output.
                    *   `AzureCoords` = `AzureCoords` - `CompA_Pixels`.
                *   `i = 1`, Color `c1 = 2` (Red).
                    *   Seed pixel (min col, then min row in `AzureCoords`) = (0, 14).
                    *   BFS from (0,14) within `AzureCoords` finds Input Component B = {(0,14)...(5,17)}. Let this be `CompB_Pixels`.
                    *   Paint `CompB_Pixels` Red (2) in output.
                    *   `AzureCoords` = `AzureCoords` - `CompB_Pixels`. (Now empty).
                *   `i = 2`, Color `c2 = 4` (Yellow). `AzureCoords` is empty. Stop.
                *   `i = 3`, Color `c3 = 7` (Orange). `AzureCoords` is empty. Stop.
                *   Final Output: Comp A is Green, Comp B is Red. STILL WRONG.

            *   The core issue is that the algorithm identifies the components based on the *initial* azure connectivity, but the *output* connectivity seems different for Ex 3. The output objects seem to correspond to the palette colors sequentially from left to right.

            *   What if the definition of "component" is restricted somehow?
            *   What if the palette source matters more directly?
                *   Color 1 (Green) comes from column 1. -> Colors the leftmost azure stuff.
                *   Color 2 (Red) comes from column 3. -> Colors the next leftmost azure stuff.
                *   Color 3 (Yellow) comes from column 5. -> Colors the next leftmost.
                *   Color 4 (Orange) comes from column 7. -> Colors the last azure stuff.

            *   Maybe the process is like this:
                1. Extract palette `P = [c1, c2, ..., cn]`.
                2. Find all azure pixels `AzureCoords`.
                3. Create `n` empty sets, `OutputComponentPixels[0]` to `OutputComponentPixels[n-1]`.
                4. While `AzureCoords` is not empty:
                   a. Find the pixel `(r, c)` in `AzureCoords` with the minimum column index `c` (and min `r` for ties).
                   b. Perform a flood fill (BFS/DFS, 8-conn) starting from `(r, c)` using only pixels in `AzureCoords`. Let the found component be `CurrentAzureComponent`.
                   c. Find which palette color `P[k]` corresponds to this component. How? Maybe based on the `min_col` of `CurrentAzureComponent` relative to other components found so far? This seems overly complex.

            *   Let's reconsider the successful examples (1 & 2). In those cases, the number of input azure components (sorted by min_col) matched the number of palette colors. The `i`-th component was colored with the `i`-th palette color.
            *   In Example 3, we have 4 palette colors but only 2 input azure components.
            *   Maybe the rule *is* `i`-th component gets `i`-th color, but if there are more colors than components, the extra colors are ignored? Let's test this simpler idea.
                *   Ex 1: Palette `[4, 3, 2]`, Comps `[A, B, C]`. Output: A=4, B=3, C=2. Matches Expected.
                *   Ex 2: Palette `[1, 6, 7]`, Comps `[A, B, C]`. Output: A=1, B=6, C=7. Matches Expected.
                *   Ex 3: Palette `[3, 2, 4, 7]`, Comps `[A, B]`. Output: A=3, B=2. Colors 4 and 7 are unused.
                    *   Let's check this against Expected Output 3.
                        *   Expected Output 3 has Green(3), Red(2), Yellow(4), Orange(7).
                        *   The simple rule (A=3, B=2) produces: Green pixels where A was, Red pixels where B was. This is NOT the expected output.

            *   Okay, the initial code logic was actually closer, but the provided "Transformed Output" in the prompt for Ex 1 and 2 seems wrong. The code *should* produce the expected output for Ex 1 and 2. The failure *is* specific to Ex 3.
            *   Why does Ex 3 split the input components?
            *   Input Comp A -> Output Green + Output Red
            *   Input Comp B -> Output Yellow + Output Orange
            *   The split seems to happen based on the colors. There are 4 colors, so the azure pixels are somehow divided into 4 groups, ordered left-to-right, and colored according to the palette.

            *   Hypothesis 4 (Refined Sequential Coloring):
                1. Extract palette `P = [c1, c2, ..., cn]`.
                2. Find the set of all azure pixel coordinates `AzureCoords`.
                3. Initialize output grid to white.
                4. Create a list of output components `OutputComponents = []`.
                5. While `AzureCoords` is not empty:
                   a. Find the pixel `(r, c)` in `AzureCoords` with the minimum column index `c` (and min `r` for ties).
                   b. Perform a flood fill (BFS/DFS, 8-conn) starting from `(r, c)` using only pixels in `AzureCoords`. Let the found component coordinates be `CurrentComponentPixels`.
                   c. Add `CurrentComponentPixels` to the `OutputComponents` list.
                   d. Remove `CurrentComponentPixels` from `AzureCoords`.
                6. Now `OutputComponents` contains azure components, discovered in left-to-right order based on their seed pixel.
                7. For `i` from 0 to `min(len(OutputComponents), len(P)) - 1`:
                   a. Get the `i`-th component `Comp_i = OutputComponents[i]`.
                   b. Get the `i`-th color `Color_i = P[i]`.
                   c. Paint the pixels in `Comp_i` with `Color_i` on the output grid.
                8. Return output grid.

            *   Trace Example 3 with Hypothesis 4:
                *   Palette `P = [3, 2, 4, 7]`.
                *   `AzureCoords` = All azure pixels.
                *   Output grid = white.
                *   `OutputComponents = []`.
                *   Loop 1:
                    *   Seed pixel = (0, 9).
                    *   BFS finds Input Comp A = {(0,9)...(3,12)}. `CurrentComponentPixels = CompA_Pixels`.
                    *   `OutputComponents = [CompA_Pixels]`.
                    *   `AzureCoords` = `AzureCoords` - `CompA_Pixels`.
                *   Loop 2:
                    *   Seed pixel = (0, 14).
                    *   BFS finds Input Comp B = {(0,14)...(5,17)}. `CurrentComponentPixels = CompB_Pixels`.
                    *   `OutputComponents = [CompA_Pixels, CompB_Pixels]`.
                    *   `AzureCoords` = `AzureCoords` - `CompB_Pixels`. (Now empty).
                *   `AzureCoords` is empty. Stop discovery loop.
                *   `OutputComponents` has length 2. Palette `P` has length 4. `min(2, 4) = 2`.
                *   Coloring loop `i` from 0 to 1:
                    *   `i = 0`: Paint `CompA_Pixels` (OutputComponents[0]) with `P[0]` (Green=3).
                    *   `i = 1`: Paint `CompB_Pixels` (OutputComponents[1]) with `P[1]` (Red=2).
                *   Return output grid.
                *   Result: Comp A is Green, Comp B is Red. STILL WRONG for Ex 3.

            *   The crucial point must be *how* the azure pixels are grouped/assigned to colors. It's not based on the initial connectivity components. It *must* be driven by the palette order.

            *   Hypothesis 5 (Palette-Driven Flood Fill):
                1. Extract palette `P = [c1, c2, ..., cn]`.
                2. Find the set of all azure pixel coordinates `AzureCoords`.
                3. Initialize output grid to white.
                4. For `i` from 0 to `
