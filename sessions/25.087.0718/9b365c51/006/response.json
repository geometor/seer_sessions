The prompt's transformed output shows Comp B = 4 and Comp C = 3. This suggests either the palette was `[4, 4, 3]` or the components were mapped `A->0, B->0, C->1`. Neither makes sense with the code.\n    *   Let's assume the code *did* produce the Expected Output for Example 1, but failed on 2 and 3. Or maybe the bug is subtler.

This matches the EXPECTED output.\n    *   Conclusion for Example 1: The provided `Transformed Output` in the prompt seems inconsistent with the provided code's logic. The code's logic *should* produce the `Expected Output` for Example 1. The discrepancy reported (\"Pixels Off: 24\") must stem from this inconsistency.

No, seems to be {(1,11),(1,12),(2,11),(2,12),(3,11),(3,12)} which are part of component A in the *input*. This is confusing.\n            *   Let's re-examine Expected Output 3 carefully.\n                *   Green (3) pixels: (0,9), (0,10), (1,9), (1,10). Min_col=9. This is the top part of input Comp A.\n                *   Red (2) pixels: (1,11), (1,12), (2,11), (2,12), (3,11), (3,12). Min_col=11. This is the bottom part of input Comp A.\n                *   Yellow (4) pixels: (0,14), (0,15), (1,14), (1,15), (2,14), (2,15), (3,14), (3,15), (4,14), (4,15). Min_col=14. This is the left part of input Comp B.\n                *   Orange (7) pixels: (3,16), (3,17), (4,16), (4,17), (5,16), (5,17). Min_col=16. This is the right part of input Comp B.\n    *   Hypothesis: The rule isn't about coloring the entire input azure components. It seems the *output* objects are derived from the *input* azure shapes, but might be split differently based on the palette colors. The number of output objects seems to match the number of palette colors.\n    *   Let's revisit Example 1 with this idea.\n        *   Palette: `[4, 3, 2]` (Yellow, Green, Red)\n        *   Input Azure Components: A (min 8), B (min 12), C (min 15)\n        *   Expected Output Objects (based on color):\n            *   Obj 1 (Yellow): Corresponds exactly to Input Comp A. Min_col 8.\n            *   Obj 2 (Green): Corresponds exactly to Input Comp B. Min_col 12.\n            *   Obj 3 (Red): Corresponds exactly to Input Comp C. Min_col 15.\n        *   Okay, so for Example 1, the mapping is 1:1 between input azure components and output colored objects, ordered by min_col.\n    *   Example 2:\n        *   Palette: `[1, 6, 7]` (Blue, Magenta, Orange)\n        *   Input Azure Components: A (min 7), B (min 10), C (min 12)\n        *   Expected Output Objects:\n            *   Obj 1 (Blue): Corresponds exactly to Input Comp A. Min_col 7.\n            *   Obj 2 (Magenta): Corresponds exactly to Input Comp B. Min_col 10.\n            *   Obj 3 (Orange): Corresponds exactly to Input Comp C. Min_col 12.\n        *   Again, 1:1 mapping ordered by min_col.\n    *   Example 3:\n        *   Palette: `[3, 2, 4, 7]` (Green, Red, Yellow, Orange)\n        *   Input Azure Components: A (min 9), B (min 14)\n        *   Expected Output Objects:\n            *   Obj 1 (Green): Top part of Input Comp A. Min_col 9.\n            *   Obj 2 (Red): Bottom part of Input Comp A. Min_col 11.\n            *   Obj 3 (Yellow): Left part of Input Comp B. Min_col 14.\n            *   Obj 4 (Orange): Right part of Input Comp B. Min_col 16.\n    *   Okay, the pattern is emerging:\n        1.  Extract the color palette `P` from odd columns as before. `P = [c1, c2, ..., cn]`\n        2.  Find *all* azure pixels in the input. Let this set be `AzureCoords`.\n        3.  Initialize the output grid to white.\n        4.  Iterate through the palette colors `ci` from `i = 0` to `n-1`.\n        5.  For the current color `ci`, find the connected component of azure pixels within `AzureCoords` that has the overall minimum column index. Let this component be `Comp_i`.\n        6.  Color all pixels of `Comp_i` in the output grid with color `ci`.\n        7.  Remove the coordinates of `Comp_i` from `AzureCoords`.\n        8.  Repeat steps 5-7 until the palette is exhausted or `AzureCoords` is empty.\n\n    *   Let's trace Example 3 with this new logic:\n        *   Palette `P = [3, 2, 4, 7]`.\n        *   `AzureCoords` = All azure pixels from input.\n        *   `i=0`, color `c0 = 3` (Green).\n            *   Find component in `AzureCoords` with minimum `min_col`. The overall min_col is 9 (from pixel (0,9)).\n            *   The component connected to (0,9) using only pixels currently in `AzureCoords` is Input Comp A: {(0,9), (0,10), (1,9), (1,10), (1,11), (1,12), (2,11), (2,12), (3,11), (3,12)}. Let's call this `CurrentComp`. Min_col is 9.\n            *   Wait, the rule isn't \"find the component with the minimum column index\". The expected output splits Input Comp A.\n            *   Let's reconsider the relationship between palette colors and output objects in Ex 3.\n                *   Palette: `[3, 2, 4, 7]`\n                *   Output Objects (ordered by palette): Green (min 9), Red (min 11), Yellow (min 14), Orange (min 16).\n                *   The min_col of the output objects increases.\n            *   Maybe the rule is:\n                1. Get palette `P = [c1, c2, ..., cn]`.\n                2. Find all input azure components `InputComps`, sorted by `min_col`. `InputComps = [CompA, CompB, ...]`.\n                3. Create a mapping. How many palette colors per input component?\n                   * Ex1: 3 colors, 3 components. 1:1 mapping.\n                   * Ex2: 3 colors, 3 components. 1:1 mapping.\n                   * Ex3: 4 colors, 2 components. How to map? Maybe the mapping depends on the *relative size* or some other property? No, that seems too complex.\n                   * What if the \"objects\" being colored aren't the pre-identified azure components, but rather sub-parts determined sequentially?\n\n            *   Let's refine the sequential idea:\n                1.  Extract palette `P = [c1, c2, ..., cn]`.\n                2.  Maintain a set of `RemainingAzureCoords` = all azure pixels from input.\n                3.  Initialize output grid.\n                4.  For `i` from 0 to `n-1`:\n                    a.  Find the pixel `(r, c)` in `RemainingAzureCoords` with the minimum column index `c`. If there are ties, pick the one with the minimum row index `r`. Let this be `seed_pixel`.\n                    b.  Perform a flood fill (BFS/DFS using 8-connectivity) starting from `seed_pixel`, only visiting pixels that are in `RemainingAzureCoords`. Let the set of found pixels be `CurrentComponentPixels`.\n                    c.  Color all pixels in `CurrentComponentPixels` in the output grid with `P[i]`.\n                    d.  Remove `CurrentComponentPixels` from `RemainingAzureCoords`.\n                5.  Return output grid.\n\n            *   Let's trace Example 3 with *this* logic:\n                *   Palette `P = [3, 2, 4, 7]`.\n                *   `RemainingAzureCoords` = All azure pixels.\n                *   Output grid = all white.\n                *   `i = 0`, color `c0 = 3` (Green).\n                    *   Min `c` in `RemainingAzureCoords` is 9 (pixels (0,9), (1,9)). Min `r` among these is 0. `seed_pixel = (0,9)`.\n                    *   Flood fill from (0,9) within `RemainingAzureCoords`: This finds all pixels of Input Comp A: {(0,9), (0,10), (1,9), (1,10), (1,11), (1,12), (2,11), (2,12), (3,11), (3,12)}. Let this be `CurrentComponentPixels`.\n                    *   Color these pixels green (3) in the output grid.\n                    *   Remove these pixels from `RemainingAzureCoords`.\n                *   `i = 1`, color `c1 = 2` (Red).\n                    *   Min `c` in `RemainingAzureCoords` is now 14 (pixels (0,14), (1,14), ...). Min `r` is 0. `seed_pixel = (0,14)`.\n                    *   Flood fill from (0,14) within `RemainingAzureCoords`: This finds all pixels of Input Comp B: {(0,14), (0,15), ..., (5,17)}. Let this be `CurrentComponentPixels`.\n                    *   Color these pixels red (2) in the output grid.\n                    *   Remove these pixels from `RemainingAzureCoords`.\n                *   `i = 2`, color `c2 = 4` (Yellow). `RemainingAzureCoords` is empty. Stop.\n                *   Resulting Output: Comp A is Green, Comp B is Red. This *still* doesn't match Expected Output 3.\n\n            *   What did I miss in the expected output for Ex 3?\n                *   Green: {(0,9), (0,10), (1,9), (1,10)}\n                *   Red: {(1,11), (1,12), (2,11), (2,12), (3,11), (3,12)}\n                *   Yellow: {(0,14), (0,15), (1,14), (1,15), (2,14), (2,15), (3,14), (3,15), (4,14), (4,15)}\n                *   Orange: {(3,16), (3,17), (4,16), (4,17), (5,16), (5,17)}\n                *   These four sets are disjoint, and their union is exactly the set of all input azure pixels.\n                *   They seem to be four distinct connected components *if* you consider connectivity based on the final colors.\n                *   Ordering seems based on min_col: Green (9), Red (11), Yellow (14), Orange (16). This matches the palette order `[3, 2, 4, 7]`.\n\n            *   How are these components identified? They are *not* the components found by BFS on the original azure pixels starting from the min-col seed.\n            *   Maybe the definition of \"component\" is different? Or the starting point?\n            *   Look at the palette source columns again:\n                *   Col 1: Green (3)\n                *   Col 3: Red (2)\n                *   Col 5: Yellow (4)\n                *   Col 7: Orange (7)\n            *   Look at the output objects again:\n                *   Green Obj (min_col 9)\n                *   Red Obj (min_col 11)\n                *   Yellow Obj (min_col 14)\n                *   Orange Obj (min_col 16)\n\n            *   There's a spatial relationship. The colors are applied left-to-right based on the palette order, and they seem to 'claim' the leftmost available azure pixels.\n\n            *   Revised Hypothesis 3:\n                1.

Find the pixel `(r, c)` in `AzureCoords` that has the minimum column index `c`. If ties, use the minimum row index `r`. Let this be `seed_pixel`.\n                    c.  Perform a flood fill (BFS/DFS using 8-connectivity) starting from `seed_pixel`, visiting only pixels that are in `AzureCoords`. Let the found set be `CurrentComponentPixels`.\n                    d.  Assign color `P[i]` to all pixels in `CurrentComponentPixels` in the output grid.\n                    e.  Remove `CurrentComponentPixels` from `AzureCoords`.\n                5.  Return output grid.\n\n            *   Let's re-trace Example 3 with Hypothesis 3:\n                *   Palette `P = [3, 2, 4, 7]`.\n                *   `AzureCoords` = All azure pixels.\n                *   Output grid = white.\n                *   `i = 0`, Color `c0 = 3` (Green).\n                    *   Seed pixel (min col, then min row in `AzureCoords`) = (0, 9).\n                    *   BFS from (0,9) within `AzureCoords` finds Input Component A = {(0,9)...(3,12)}. Let this be `CompA_Pixels`.\n                    *   Paint `CompA_Pixels` Green (3) in output.\n                    *   `AzureCoords` = `AzureCoords` - `CompA_Pixels`.\n                *   `i = 1`, Color `c1 = 2` (Red).\n                    *   Seed pixel (min col, then min row in `AzureCoords`) = (0, 14).\n                    *   BFS from (0,14) within `AzureCoords` finds Input Component B = {(0,14)...(5,17)}. Let this be `CompB_Pixels`.\n                    *   Paint `CompB_Pixels` Red (2) in output.\n                    *   `AzureCoords` = `AzureCoords` - `CompB_Pixels`. (Now empty).\n                *   `i = 2`, Color `c2 = 4` (Yellow). `AzureCoords` is empty. Stop.\n                *   `i = 3`, Color `c3 = 7` (Orange). `AzureCoords` is empty. Stop.\n                *   Final Output: Comp A is Green, Comp B is Red. STILL WRONG.\n\n            *   The core issue is that the algorithm identifies the components based on the *initial* azure connectivity, but the *output* connectivity seems different for Ex 3. The output objects seem to correspond to the palette colors sequentially from left to right.\n\n            *   What if the definition of \"component\" is restricted somehow?\n            *   What if the palette source matters more directly?\n                *   Color 1 (Green) comes from column 1. -> Colors the leftmost azure stuff.\n                *   Color 2 (Red) comes from column 3. -> Colors the next leftmost azure stuff.\n                *   Color 3 (Yellow) comes from column 5. -> Colors the next leftmost.\n                *   Color 4 (Orange) comes from column 7. -> Colors the last azure stuff.\n\n            *   Maybe the process is like this:\n                1. Extract palette `P = [c1, c2, ..., cn]`.\n                2. Find all azure pixels `AzureCoords`.\n                3. Create `n` empty sets, `OutputComponentPixels[0]` to `OutputComponentPixels[n-1]`.\n                4. While `AzureCoords` is not empty:\n                   a. Find the pixel `(r, c)` in `AzureCoords` with the minimum column index `c` (and min `r` for ties).\n                   b. Perform a flood fill (BFS/DFS, 8-conn) starting from `(r, c)` using only pixels in `AzureCoords`. Let the found component be `CurrentAzureComponent`.\n                   c. Find which palette color `P[k]` corresponds to this component. How? Maybe based on the `min_col` of `CurrentAzureComponent` relative to other components found so far? This seems overly complex.\n\n            *   Let's reconsider the successful examples (1 & 2). In those cases, the number of input azure components (sorted by min_col) matched the number of palette colors. The `i`-th component was colored with the `i`-th palette color.\n            *   In Example 3, we have 4 palette colors but only 2 input azure components.\n            *   Maybe the rule *is* `i`-th component gets `i`-th color, but if there are more colors than components, the extra colors are ignored? Let's test this simpler idea.\n                *   Ex 1: Palette `[4, 3, 2]`, Comps `[A, B, C]`. Output: A=4, B=3, C=2. Matches Expected.\n                *   Ex 2: Palette `[1, 6, 7]`, Comps `[A, B, C]`. Output: A=1, B=6, C=7. Matches Expected.\n                *   Ex 3: Palette `[3, 2, 4, 7]`, Comps `[A, B]`. Output: A=3, B=2. Colors 4 and 7 are unused.\n                    *   Let's check this against Expected Output 3.\n                        *   Expected Output 3 has Green(3), Red(2), Yellow(4), Orange(7).\n                        *   The simple rule (A=3, B=2) produces: Green pixels where A was, Red pixels where B was. This is NOT the expected output.\n\n            *   Okay, the initial code logic was actually closer, but the provided \"Transformed Output\" in the prompt for Ex 1 and 2 seems wrong. The code *should* produce the expected output for Ex 1 and 2. The failure *is* specific to Ex 3.\n            *   Why does Ex 3 split the input components?\n            *   Input Comp A -> Output Green + Output Red\n            *   Input Comp B -> Output Yellow + Output Orange\n            *   The split seems to happen based on the colors. There are 4 colors, so the azure pixels are somehow divided into 4 groups, ordered left-to-right, and colored according to the palette.\n\n            *   Hypothesis 4 (Refined Sequential Coloring):\n                1. Extract palette `P = [c1, c2, ..., cn]`.\n                2. Find the set of all azure pixel coordinates `AzureCoords`.\n                3. Initialize output grid to white.\n                4. Create a list of output components `OutputComponents = []`.\n                5. While `AzureCoords` is not empty:\n                   a. Find the pixel `(r, c)` in `AzureCoords` with the minimum column index `c` (and min `r` for ties).\n                   b. Perform a flood fill (BFS/DFS, 8-conn) starting from `(r, c)` using only pixels in `AzureCoords`. Let the found component coordinates be `CurrentComponentPixels`.\n                   c. Add `CurrentComponentPixels` to the `OutputComponents` list.\n                   d. Remove `CurrentComponentPixels` from `AzureCoords`.\n                6. Now `OutputComponents` contains azure components, discovered in left-to-right order based on their seed pixel.\n                7. For `i` from 0 to `min(len(OutputComponents), len(P)) - 1`:\n                   a. Get the `i`-th component `Comp_i = OutputComponents[i]`.\n                   b. Get the `i`-th color `Color_i = P[i]`.\n                   c. Paint the pixels in `Comp_i` with `Color_i` on the output grid.\n                8. Return output grid.\n\n            *   Trace Example 3 with Hypothesis 4:\n                *   Palette `P = [3, 2, 4, 7]`.\n                *   `AzureCoords` = All azure pixels.\n                *   Output grid = white.\n                *   `OutputComponents = []`.\n                *   Loop 1:\n                    *   Seed pixel = (0, 9).\n                    *   BFS finds Input Comp A = {(0,9)...(3,12)}. `CurrentComponentPixels = CompA_Pixels`.\n                    *   `OutputComponents = [CompA_Pixels]`.\n                    *   `AzureCoords` = `AzureCoords` - `CompA_Pixels`.\n                *   Loop 2:\n                    *   Seed pixel = (0, 14).\n                    *   BFS finds Input Comp B = {(0,14)...(5,17)}. `CurrentComponentPixels = CompB_Pixels`.\n                    *   `OutputComponents = [CompA_Pixels, CompB_Pixels]`.\n                    *   `AzureCoords` = `AzureCoords` - `CompB_Pixels`. (Now empty).\n                *   `AzureCoords` is empty. Stop discovery loop.\n                *   `OutputComponents` has length 2. Palette `P` has length 4. `min(2, 4) = 2`.\n                *   Coloring loop `i` from 0 to 1:\n                    *   `i = 0`: Paint `CompA_Pixels` (OutputComponents[0]) with `P[0]` (Green=3).\n                    *   `i = 1`: Paint `CompB_Pixels` (OutputComponents[1]) with `P[1]` (Red=2).\n                *   Return output grid.\n                *   Result: Comp A is Green, Comp B is Red. STILL WRONG for Ex 3.\n\n            *   The crucial point must be *how* the azure pixels are grouped/assigned to colors. It's not based on the initial connectivity components. It *must* be driven by the palette order.\n\n            *   Hypothesis 5 (Palette-Driven Flood Fill):\n                1. Extract palette `P = [c1, c2, ..., cn]`.\n                2.
