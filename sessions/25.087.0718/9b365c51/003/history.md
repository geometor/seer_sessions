"""
This transformation identifies vertical colored lines in the odd-numbered columns 
on the left side of the input grid and uses their colors to paint corresponding 
azure shapes found on the right side.

1.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
2.  Scan the input grid's odd-numbered columns (1, 3, 5, ...) from left to right.
    Collect the non-white color found in each of these columns into an ordered list (`color_palette`).
3.  Identify all distinct contiguous shapes composed of azure pixels (8) in the input grid.
4.  Sort these azure shapes based on their horizontal position (leftmost pixel).
5.  Iterate through the sorted azure shapes. For the Nth shape, paint its pixels in 
    the output grid using the Nth color from the `color_palette`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.

Hold on, the metric gathering revealed an issue.
1.  **Palette:** The `get_color_palette` function continued collecting colors (specifically azure=8) even after the distinct color lines stopped. The palette should only contain the colors from the initial sequence of non-white, non-azure lines in the odd columns.
2.  **Start Column Mismatch in Example 3:** The code identified start columns `[9, 11, 14, 16]`. Looking at the input grid for Example 3, the rightmost azure pixels are at `(5, 17)` and `(6, 17)`. Looking left from `(5, 17)`, the first azure pixel is `(5, 17)`. Looking left from `(6, 17)`, the first azure pixel is `(6, 17)`. Why did the code report 16? Let me re-check the logic. Ah, `np.argwhere` gives row, col. The code uses `c` correctly. Let's trace `(5, 17)`: `start_c = 17`. `grid[5, 16]` is 0 (white). So loop `while start_c > 0 and grid[r, start_c - 1] == 8:` condition `grid[5, 17-1] == 8` (i.e. `grid[5, 16] == 8`) is false. `start_c` remains 17. Same for `(6, 17)`. The unique start columns should be `[9, 11, 14, 17]`. The code output `[9, 11, 14, 16]` is wrong.

Let's re-run the start column calculation carefully.
Example 3 Input:

```
... 8 8 0 0 # Row 0: (0,9), (0,10) | (0,14), (0,15) | -> Starts 9, 14
... 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 # Row 1: (1,9), (1,10), (1,11), (1,12) | (1,14), (1,15) | -> Starts 9, 14
... 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 # Row 2: (2,11), (2,12) | (2,14), (2,15) | -> Starts 11, 14
... 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 # Row 3: (3,11), (3,12) | (3,14), (3,15), (3,16), (3,17) | -> Starts 11, 14
... 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 # Row 4: (4,14), (4,15), (4,16), (4,17) | -> Start 14
... 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 # Row 5: (5,17), (5,18) -> Error! Should be (5,16), (5,17)? Let me check input again.
```

Input 3 again:

```
col: 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
    [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0] # Row 0: Starts 9, 14
    [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0] # Row 1: Starts 9, 14
    [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0] # Row 2: Starts 11, 14
    [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8] # Row 3: Starts 11, 14
    [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8] # Row 4: Start 14
    [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8] # Row 5: Start 16 <<<<< This is the source of 16!
    [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # Row 6: None
```

Okay, the unique start columns found by scanning each azure pixel leftwards *are* `[9, 11, 14, 16]`.
Expected Output Painting for Example 3 used colors [3, 2, 4, 7].
- Pixels starting col 9 got 3. (Map 9 -> Palette[0]=3)
- Pixels starting col 11 got 2. (Map 11 -> Palette[1]=2)
- Pixels starting col 14 got 4. (Map 14 -> Palette[2]=4)
- Pixels starting col 16 got 7. (Map 16 -> Palette[3]=7)

My manual check against the expected output was wrong. Let's re-verify Expected 3:

```
... 3 3 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 # Row 0: 3@9,10 ; 4@14,15
... 3 3 2 2 0 4 4 0 0 # Row 1: 3@9,10 ; 2@11,12 ; 4@14,15
... 0 0 2 2 0 4 4 0 0 # Row 2: 2@11,12 ; 4@14,15
... 0 0 2 2 0 4 4 7 7 # Row 3: 2@11,12 ; 4@14,15 ; 7@16,17
... 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 7 7 # Row 4: 4@14,15 ; 7@16,17
... 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 # Row 5: 7@16,17
```

Okay, the mapping is indeed: Start Col 9 -> Palette[0]=3; Start Col 11 -> Palette[1]=2; Start Col 14 -> Palette[2]=4; Start Col 16 -> Palette[3]=7.

The code *was* correct about the start columns and the mapping logic holds. The only issue identified was the palette extraction. Let's fix that and re-run metrics.

## General Assessment

The initial code failed because it incorrectly assumed a one-to-one mapping between *connected* azure shapes (sorted left-to-right) and the colors derived from the vertical lines. The key insight from analyzing the failed examples is that the mapping is more granular: it depends on the *horizontal starting column* of segments of azure pixels within each row. A single connected azure shape in the input might be painted with multiple colors in the output if it spans different horizontal start columns that map to different palette colors. The palette extraction also needed correction to stop collecting colors once the sequence of vertical lines ends (indicated by an all-white or azure column in an odd-numbered position).

## Metrics

**Example 1:**
- Input Shape: (8, 20)
- Palette (Colors from odd columns 1, 3, 5): [Yellow (4), Green (3), Red (2)]
- Azure Pixel Horizontal Start Columns (Sorted): [8, 12, 15]
- Mapping: {8: Yellow, 12: Green, 15: Red}
- Verification: Matches expected output (pixels starting col 8 are yellow, starting col 12 are green, starting col 15 are red).

**Example 2:**
- Input Shape: (6, 15)
- Palette (Colors from odd columns 1, 3, 5): [Blue (1), Magenta (6), Orange (7)]
- Azure Pixel Horizontal Start Columns (Sorted): [7, 10, 12]
- Mapping: {7: Blue, 10: Magenta, 12: Orange}
- Verification: Matches expected output.

**Example 3:**
- Input Shape: (7, 18)
- Palette (Colors from odd columns 1, 3, 5, 7): [Green (3), Red (2), Yellow (4), Orange (7)]
- Azure Pixel Horizontal Start Columns (Sorted): [9, 11, 14, 16]
- Mapping: {9: Green, 11: Red, 14: Yellow, 16: Orange}
- Verification: Matches expected output.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
task_description: Paint azure shapes based on colors from vertical lines.
input_features:
  - name: color_lines
    description: Vertical lines of a single color located in odd-numbered columns (1, 3, 5, ...).
    properties:
      - location: Left side of the grid, odd columns.
      - content: Contain a single non-white, non-azure color.
      - significance: Define an ordered color palette. The order is determined by the column index (left-to-right). Collection stops if an odd column is all white or contains azure.
  - name: azure_shapes
    description: Areas composed of contiguous azure (8) pixels. Can be complex and span multiple horizontal segments.
    properties:
      - color: Azure (8).
      - role: Act as templates or masks to be painted.
      - significance: The horizontal position where a segment of azure pixels starts in a row determines which color it receives.
transformation:
  - action: identify_palette
    source: color_lines
    rule: Extract the first non-white, non-azure color from each odd column (1, 3, 5...), sequentially, until an all-white or azure column is encountered. Store these colors in an ordered list (the palette).
  - action: identify_azure_segments
    source: azure_shapes
    rule: For every azure pixel in the input grid, find the starting column index of its horizontally contiguous segment within its row.
  - action: collect_start_columns
    source: azure_segments
    rule: Gather all unique horizontal start column indices found across all azure pixels.
  - action: sort_start_columns
    source: collected_start_columns
    rule: Sort the unique start column indices in ascending order.
  - action: map_colors
    source: [sorted_start_columns, identified_palette]
    rule: Create a mapping where the Nth sorted start column corresponds to the Nth color in the palette.
  - action: paint_output
    source: [input_grid, map_colors, identified_azure_segments]
    rule: Create an output grid initialized to white. For each azure pixel (r, c) in the input grid, find its horizontal start column, look up the corresponding color from the map, and set the output grid pixel output[r, c] to that color.
output_features:
  - name: painted_grid
    description: Grid where original azure pixels are replaced by colors determined by the palette and the horizontal start position of the azure segments. Non-azure pixels remain white.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0).
2.  Create an ordered list called `color_palette`. Iterate through the input grid's columns starting from index 1, incrementing by 2 (odd columns). For each such column, find the first non-white (0), non-azure (8) color present. If such a color is found, add it to the `color_palette`. Stop this process if an odd column contains only white pixels or contains an azure pixel.
3.  Create a mapping data structure, `start_color_map`.
4.  Identify all unique horizontal start columns for azure (8) pixels:
    a. Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.
    b. If the pixel `(r, c)` is azure (8), find its horizontal segment's start column `start_c` by scanning leftwards from `c` in the same row `r` until a non-azure pixel or the grid boundary is reached. The column index of the first azure pixel in this segment is `start_c`.
    c. Collect all unique `start_c` values found across all azure pixels.
5.  Sort the unique `start_c` values in ascending order. Let the sorted list be `sorted_start_columns`.
6.  Populate the `start_color_map`: For each index `i` from 0 up to the minimum of (`length of sorted_start_columns` - 1) and (`length of color_palette` - 1), map the `i`-th element of `sorted_start_columns` to the `i`-th element of `color_palette`. (`start_color_map[sorted_start_columns[i]] = color_palette[i]`).
7.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid again.
8.  If the pixel `input_grid[r, c]` is azure (8):
    a. Find its horizontal segment's start column `start_c` (as done in step 4b).
    b. If `start_c` exists as a key in `start_color_map`, get the corresponding `paint_color = start_color_map[start_c]`.
    c. Set the output grid pixel `output_grid[r, c]` to `paint_color`.
9.  Return the `output_grid`.
