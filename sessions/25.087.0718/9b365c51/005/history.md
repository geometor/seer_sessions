"""
This transformation paints azure (8) pixels in the input grid based on a color palette derived from vertical lines in odd-numbered columns on the left. The specific color used for an azure pixel depends on the horizontal starting column of its contiguous azure segment within its row.

1.  Extract a color palette: Scan odd-numbered columns (1, 3, 5...) from left to right. For each column, find the first non-white (0), non-azure (8) color. Add this color to an ordered palette. Stop scanning if an odd column is entirely white or contains an azure pixel.
2.  Identify azure segments and their start columns: For every azure pixel in the input grid, determine the starting column index of the horizontal contiguous segment of azure pixels it belongs to within its row.
3.  Map start columns to palette colors: Collect all unique start column indices found in step 2. Sort these unique start columns numerically. Create a mapping where the Nth sorted start column corresponds to the Nth color in the extracted palette.
4.  Paint the output grid: Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with white (0). Iterate through all azure pixels in the input grid. For each azure pixel at (r, c), find its corresponding start column. Use the mapping from step 3 to determine the paint color associated with that start column. Set the pixel at (r, c) in the output grid to this paint color. If a start column doesn't have a corresponding color in the palette (e.g., more unique start columns than palette colors), the pixel remains white.

Okay, `skimage` is not available. I need to implement connected components manually or find another way.

Let's rethink the "groups". What determines the color mapping?
Palette is ordered: [Color1, Color2, Color3, ...].
How are the azure areas ordered?
In Example 1: Group A (cols 8-11), Group B (cols 12-13), Group C (cols 15-18). They are ordered left-to-right by their minimum column index. Min col are 8, 12, 15. Mapping: 8->Color1, 12->Color2, 15->Color3. This matches the expected output.

In Example 2:
Palette: [Blue=1, Magenta=6, Orange=7] (from cols 1, 3, 5)
Azure components (visual inspection):
*   Group A: Cols 7-9, Rows 0-1. Min col 7.
*   Group B: Cols 10-11, Rows 2-5. Min col 10.
*   Group C: Cols 12-14, Rows 0-2. Min col 12.
Expected output colors: Group A -> Blue(1), Group B -> Magenta(6), Group C -> Orange(7).
Order of min cols: 7, 10, 12.
Mapping: 7->Color1 (Blue), 10->Color2 (Magenta), 12->Color3 (Orange). This matches the expected output.

In Example 3:
Palette: [Green=3, Red=2, Yellow=4, Orange=7] (from cols 1, 3, 5, 7)
Azure components (visual inspection):
*   Group A: Cols 9-10, Rows 0-1. Min col 9.
*   Group B: Cols 11-12, Rows 1-3. Min col 11.
*   Group C: Cols 14-15, Rows 0-4. Min col 14.
*   Group D: Cols 16-17, Rows 3-5. Min col 16.
Expected output colors: Group A -> Green(3), Group B -> Red(2), Group C -> Yellow(4), Group D -> Orange(7).
Order of min cols: 9, 11, 14, 16.
Mapping: 9->Color1(Green), 11->Color2(Red), 14->Color3(Yellow), 16->Color4(Orange). This matches the expected output.

**Hypothesis:**
The transformation involves:
1.  Extracting the ordered color palette from odd columns (same as before).
2.  Identifying distinct connected components of azure (8) pixels (using 8-connectivity).
3.  For each component, finding its minimum column index (leftmost extent).
4.  Sorting the components based on their minimum column index.
5.  Mapping the Nth component (in sorted order) to the Nth color in the palette.
6.  Painting all pixels belonging to the Nth component with the Nth palette color in the output grid.

This revised hypothesis explains the failures of the previous code. The previous code used the start column of *horizontal segments* within each row and then sorted those unique start columns. This failed when a single connected component spanned multiple horizontal segments with different starting columns (like the component starting visually at col 8 in Ex 1, which included pixels at col 12 in rows 3 & 4, leading the code to calculate their start column as 8).

Now, I need to structure this understanding.

**Refined Plan:**
1.  **General Assessment:** The previous code failed because it incorrectly identified the units (azure segments) that map to palette colors. It should use connected components of azure pixels instead of horizontal segments within rows.
2.  **Metrics Gathering:** Re-analyze based on connected components.
    *   Example 1: Palette [4, 3, 2]. Components: Comp1 (min col 8), Comp2 (min col 12), Comp3 (min col 15). Sorted order: Comp1, Comp2, Comp3. Map: Comp1->4, Comp2->3, Comp3->2. Correct.
    *   Example 2: Palette [1, 6, 7]. Components: Comp1 (min col 7), Comp2 (min col 10), Comp3 (min col 12). Sorted order: Comp1, Comp2, Comp3. Map: Comp1->1, Comp2->6, Comp3->7. Correct.
    *   Example 3: Palette [3, 2, 4, 7]. Components: Comp1 (min col 9), Comp2 (min col 11), Comp3 (min col 14), Comp4 (min col 16). Sorted order: Comp1, Comp2, Comp3, Comp4. Map: Comp1->3, Comp2->2, Comp3->4, Comp4->7. Correct.
3.  **YAML Facts:** Document the palette extraction, the identification of connected azure components, the determination of their minimum column index, the sorting based on this index, and the mapping to palette colors.
4.  **Natural Language Program:** Describe the refined process clearly.

Let's gather the precise metrics using code execution where helpful (e.g., confirming palette, grid shapes). I can't do connected components directly, but I can simulate the process based on visual inspection and the hypothesis.

**Metrics Calculation Simulation (Mental or Manual):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 8x20
    *   Output Shape: 8x20

        *   Comp2: Pixels {(5,12), (5,13), (6,12), (6,13)}. Min Col: 12.
        *   Comp3: Pixels {(1,15), (1,16), (1,17), (1,18), (2,15), (2,16), (2,17), (2,18), (3,15), (3,16), (3,17), (3,18), (4,15), (4,16), (4,17), (4,18)}. Min Col: 15.
    *   Sorted Min Cols: [8, 12, 15]
    *   Mapping: {Comp1: 4, Comp2: 3, Comp3: 2}

    *   Sorted Min Cols: [7, 10, 12]
    *   Mapping: {Comp1: 1, Comp2: 6, Comp3: 7}
    *   Expected Output matches this mapping.

*   **Example 3:**

The hypothesis holds across all examples. The key insight is using connected components of azure pixels as the units to be colored, ordered by their leftmost position.## General Assessment

The previous code correctly implemented the logic described in its accompanying natural language program. However, that logic was flawed, leading to incorrect outputs on all training examples. The core issue lies in how the mapping between the extracted color palette and the azure (8) regions is determined. The previous approach used the starting column of horizontal azure segments within each row and sorted these start columns to map to the palette. The examples show this is incorrect; visually distinct azure regions that should receive different colors can be part of the same horizontal segment in certain rows (e.g., Example 1, Row 3/4, columns 8-13), causing the wrong color assignment.

The analysis of the input/output pairs suggests a different approach:
1.  The color palette extraction method (using odd columns) appears correct.
2.  The units to be colored are not horizontal segments per row, but rather distinct connected components of azure pixels (using 8-way connectivity, considering adjacent and diagonal pixels of the same color).
3.  These components should be ordered based on their spatial position, specifically their minimum column index (leftmost point).
4.  The Nth component in this left-to-right order corresponds to the Nth color in the extracted palette.

The strategy is to refine the natural language program to reflect this component-based mapping and then implement this logic in the coder phase. This will require an algorithm to identify connected components.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Recolor azure (8) regions based on a palette derived from vertical lines and the horizontal order of the azure regions.

input_features:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - name: palette_source_lines
    description: Vertical lines of pixels in odd-numbered columns (1, 3, 5...).
    properties:
      - Each line contributes at most one color to the palette.
      - Contribution rule: The first non-white (0), non-azure (8) color encountered scanning top-down in an odd column is added.
      - Termination: Palette extraction stops if an odd column contains azure (8) or is entirely white (0).
  - name: azure_regions
    description: Contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels.
    properties:
      - Connectivity: Pixels are connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (8-connectivity).
      - Each distinct connected component forms a region.

transformation:
  - step: extract_palette
    input: grid
    output: ordered list of colors `palette`
    action: Scan odd columns (1, 3, 5...) left-to-right. For each, find the first non-white, non-azure pixel color. Add it to `palette`. Stop if an azure pixel is found in an odd column or the column is all white.
  - step: identify_azure_components
    input: grid
    output: list of azure components, where each component is a set of (row, col) coordinates.
    action: Find all connected components of azure (8) pixels using 8-connectivity.
  - step: determine_component_order
    input: list of azure components
    output: ordered list of azure components `ordered_components`
    action: For each component, find the minimum column index among its pixels. Sort the components based on this minimum column index in ascending order.
  - step: map_colors
    input: `palette`, `ordered_components`
    output: mapping `component_color_map` where key is component ID/index and value is color.
    action: Assign the Nth color from `palette` to the Nth component in `ordered_components`. Handle cases where the number of components might not match the number of palette colors (though in examples they match).
  - step: paint_output
    input: grid dimensions, `component_color_map`, components coordinates
    output: output_grid
    action: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized to white (0). For each component in `ordered_components`, if it has a mapped color, set the color of all pixels belonging to that component in the output grid to the mapped color.

output_features:
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array of integers (colors)
    properties:
      - Same dimensions as the input grid.
      - Pixels corresponding to input azure regions are repainted according to the component-palette mapping.
      - All other pixels are white (0).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0).
2.  **Extract Color Palette:**
    a. Create an empty ordered list called `palette`.
    b. Iterate through the odd-numbered columns (index 1, 3, 5, ...) of the input grid from left to right.
    c. For each odd column:
        i. Check if any azure (8) pixel exists in this column. If yes, stop extracting the palette.
        ii. Find the first pixel in the column (scanning top to bottom) that is not white (0).
        iii. If such a pixel is found, add its color to the `palette` list and proceed to the next odd column.
        iv. If no non-white pixel is found (the column is all white), stop extracting the palette.
3.  **Identify Azure Components:** Find all distinct connected components of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Use 8-way connectivity (pixels are connected if they touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). Store each component as a collection of its (row, column) coordinates.
4.  **Order Azure Components:**
    a. For each identified azure component, determine its minimum column index (the smallest column number among all pixels in that component).
    b. Create an ordered list `ordered_components` by sorting the components based on their minimum column index in ascending (left-to-right) order.
5.  **Paint Components:**
    a. Iterate through the `ordered_components` list, keeping track of the index `i` (starting from 0).
    b. For the `i`-th component in `ordered_components`:
        i. If `i` is less than the number of colors in the `palette`:
            - Get the `i`-th color from the `palette`.
            - For every pixel coordinate (r, c) belonging to this component, set the corresponding pixel `output_grid[r, c]` to this palette color.
        ii. (Implicit) If `i` is greater than or equal to the number of colors in the `palette`, the pixels of this component remain white (0) in the output grid.
