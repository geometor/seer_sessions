task_description: Paint azure shapes based on colors from vertical lines.
input_features:
  - name: color_lines
    description: Vertical lines of a single color located in odd-numbered columns (1, 3, 5, ...).
    properties:
      - location: Left side of the grid, odd columns.
      - content: Contain a single non-white, non-azure color.
      - significance: Define an ordered color palette. The order is determined by the column index (left-to-right). Collection stops if an odd column is all white or contains azure.
  - name: azure_shapes
    description: Areas composed of contiguous azure (8) pixels. Can be complex and span multiple horizontal segments.
    properties:
      - color: Azure (8).
      - role: Act as templates or masks to be painted.
      - significance: The horizontal position where a segment of azure pixels starts in a row determines which color it receives.
transformation:
  - action: identify_palette
    source: color_lines
    rule: Extract the first non-white, non-azure color from each odd column (1, 3, 5...), sequentially, until an all-white or azure column is encountered. Store these colors in an ordered list (the palette).
  - action: identify_azure_segments
    source: azure_shapes
    rule: For every azure pixel in the input grid, find the starting column index of its horizontally contiguous segment within its row.
  - action: collect_start_columns
    source: azure_segments
    rule: Gather all unique horizontal start column indices found across all azure pixels.
  - action: sort_start_columns
    source: collected_start_columns
    rule: Sort the unique start column indices in ascending order.
  - action: map_colors
    source: [sorted_start_columns, identified_palette]
    rule: Create a mapping where the Nth sorted start column corresponds to the Nth color in the palette.
  - action: paint_output
    source: [input_grid, map_colors, identified_azure_segments]
    rule: Create an output grid initialized to white. For each azure pixel (r, c) in the input grid, find its horizontal start column, look up the corresponding color from the map, and set the output grid pixel output[r, c] to that color.
output_features:
  - name: painted_grid
    description: Grid where original azure pixels are replaced by colors determined by the palette and the horizontal start position of the azure segments. Non-azure pixels remain white.
