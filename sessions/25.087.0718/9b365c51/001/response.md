"""
This transformation identifies vertical colored lines in the odd-numbered columns 
on the left side of the input grid and uses their colors to paint corresponding 
azure shapes found on the right side.

1.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
2.  Scan the input grid's odd-numbered columns (1, 3, 5, ...) from left to right.
    Collect the non-white color found in each of these columns into an ordered list (`color_palette`).
3.  Identify all distinct contiguous shapes composed of azure pixels (8) in the input grid.
4.  Sort these azure shapes based on their horizontal position (leftmost pixel).
5.  Iterate through the sorted azure shapes. For the Nth shape, paint its pixels in 
    the output grid using the Nth color from the `color_palette`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
