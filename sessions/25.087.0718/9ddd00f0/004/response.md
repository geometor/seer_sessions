Okay, let's analyze the examples and refine the transformation rule.

**General Assessment & Strategy**

The previous code failed on both examples, indicating the initial hypothesis derived from only the first example was incorrect or incomplete. The core operation seems to involve selecting the *first* contiguous block of non-background columns (the "first object"), reflecting it vertically, and repositioning it relative to an adjacent separator column (a column containing only the background color). The key difference between the examples lies in *which* adjacent separator dictates the final position: the one *before* the block (if it exists) takes precedence over the one *after* the block. The rest of the grid remains unchanged from the initial state (achieved by copying the input initially and only modifying the source and target areas of the transformed block).

**Metrics and Observations**

Let's use python to verify the structure of the examples.
