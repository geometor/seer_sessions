task_description: |-
  The transformation operates on vertical blocks of columns separated by columns containing only the background color (white, 0).
  The core operation involves the first identified content block (non-separator columns). Subsequent blocks and separators are potentially preserved.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - separator_column: A column containing only the background color.
  - content_block: A contiguous sequence of one or more columns that are not separator columns.

objects:
  - object: first_content_block
    definition: The leftmost content_block in the input grid.
    properties:
      - start_column: index of the first column of the block.
      - end_column: index of the last column of the block.
      - width: number of columns in the block.
      - data: the pixel values within the block's columns.
      - preceded_by_separator: boolean, true if start_column > 0 and column (start_column - 1) is a separator_column.
      - preceding_separator_index: index of the separator column immediately before the block, if it exists.

actions:
  - action: initialize_output
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    effect: Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.

  - action: reflect_and_place
    condition: Applies only to the first_content_block.
    source_object: first_content_block
    target_grid: output_grid
    steps:
      - step: Reflect the block's data vertically (across the horizontal midline).
      - step: Determine placement based on preceded_by_separator:
          - If TRUE:
              - Calculate target_start_column = start_column - (preceding_separator_index + 1).
              - Calculate target_end_column = target_start_column + width - 1.
              - Ensure target columns are within grid bounds.
          - If FALSE:
              - target_start_column = start_column.
              - target_end_column = end_column.
      - step: Clear the content within the target columns (target_start_column to target_end_column) in the output_grid, setting them to the background color.
      - step: Place the vertically reflected block data into the target columns of the output_grid.

final_state: The output_grid after the reflect_and_place action has been applied to the first_content_block based on the initialization from the input_grid. All other parts of the grid remain as they were in the original input.
