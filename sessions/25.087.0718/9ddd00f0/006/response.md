*   The identification is correct. Block 1 is followed by sep 2. Block 2 is preceded by sep 2.

*   **Revisiting Movement Rule:**
    *   For Block 1 (cols 0-1), followed by sep 2. Target: cols 1-2.
    *   For Block 2 (cols 3-4), preceded by sep 2. Target: cols 3-4.

*   How does Block 1 move? Original cols 0-1 map to target cols 1-2. Shift right by 1.
*   How does Block 2 move? Original cols 3-4 map to target cols 3-4. No shift.

*   **Fifth Hypothesis:**
    1.  Initialize output grid with background color.
    2.  Identify separator columns and content blocks.
    3.  For each content block (start_col, end_col, width w):
        a. Extract and vertically flip block data.
        b. Determine target start column `target_start`:
            i.   If block is followed by a separator `sep_idx = end_col + 1`, then `target_start = start_col + 1`. (Shift right by 1).
            ii.  Else if block is preceded by a separator `sep_idx = start_col - 1`, then `target_start = start_col`. (No shift).
            iii. Else (no adjacent separator), `target_start = start_col`. (No shift).
        c. Place flipped block at `target_start`.

*   **Testing Fifth Hypothesis:**
    *   **Example 1:**
        *   Block 1 (cols 4-6, w=3): Preceded by sep 3. Rule (ii): `target_start = start_col = 4`. Target cols 4-6. -> Doesn't match expected (cols 1-3). FAIL.
    *   **Example 2:**
        *   Block 1 (cols 0-1, w=2): Followed by sep 2. Rule (i): `target_start = start_col + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`. Target cols 1-2. -> Matches expected.
        *   Block 2 (cols 3-4, w=2): Preceded by sep 2. Rule (ii): `target_start = start_col = 3`. Target cols 3-4. -> Matches expected.
    *   This hypothesis works for Example 2 but fails for Example 1.

*   **Contradiction:** The rule for Example 1 seems different from Example 2. Let's look again at Example 1's transformation.
    *   Block 1 (cols 4-6) moves to cols 1-3. Preceded by sep 3. Shift left by 3.
    *   Block 2 (cols 8-10) moves to cols 5-7. Preceded by sep 7. Shift left by 3.
    *   The shift amount is `start_col - target_start`. For Block 1: 4 - 1 = 3. For Block 2: 8 - 5 = 3.
    *   The shift amount (3) is equal to the block width in Example 1.

*   **Sixth Hypothesis:**
    1. Initialize output grid with background color.
    2. Identify separator columns and content blocks.
    3. For each content block (start_col, end_col, width w):
        a. Extract and vertically flip block data.
        b. Determine target start column `target_start`:
            i.  If block is preceded by a separator `sep_idx = start_col - 1`: `target_start = start_col - w`. (Shift left by width).
            ii. Else if block is followed by a separator `sep_idx = end_col + 1`: `target_start = start_col + 1`. (Shift right by 1).
            iii.Else: `target_start = start_col`. (No shift).
        c. Place flipped block at `target_start` (handle clipping).

*   **Testing Sixth Hypothesis:**
    *   **Example 1:**
        *   Block 1 (cols 4-6, w=3): Preceded by sep 3. Rule (i): `target_start = 4 - 3 = 1`. Target cols 1-3. -> Matches expected.
        *   Block 2 (cols 8-10, w=3): Preceded by sep 7. Rule (i): `target_start = 8 - 3 = 5`. Target cols 5-7. -> Matches expected.
    *   **Example 2:**
        *   Block 1 (cols 0-1, w=2): Followed by sep 2. Rule (ii): `target_start = 0 + 1 = 1`. Target cols 1-2. -> Matches expected.
        *   Block 2 (cols 3-4, w=2): Preceded by sep 2. Rule (i): `target_start = 3 - 2 = 1`. Target cols 1-2. -> Doesn't match expected (cols 3-4). FAIL.

*   **Where did the previous logic go wrong?** The initial code *did* shift Block 1 (Ex 2) correctly using `target_start = sep_idx - width + 1` (2 - 2 + 1 = 1). And it shifted Block 1 (Ex 1) correctly (3 - 3 + 1 = 1). And Block 2 (Ex 1) correctly (7 - 3 + 1 = 5). This formula `target_start = sep_idx - width + 1` seems robust for the *relative positioning*.
*   The original code's main failure was only processing the *first* block.
*   The secondary failure might be in how the output grid is constructed (clearing original vs. building fresh).

*   **Let's re-evaluate the Fourth Hypothesis (the refined version of the first idea), but ensure the output construction is correct.**
    *   Hypothesis: Process *all* blocks. Use `target_start = sep_idx - w + 1` if adjacent separator exists (prefer preceding), else `target_start = start_col`. Build output grid by placing transformed blocks onto a background grid.

*   **Testing Fourth Hypothesis (Again):**
    1.  Initialize output grid with background color.
    2.  Identify separators {2} and blocks [(0, 1, w=2), (3, 4, w=2)] for Ex 2.
    3.  **Process Block 1 (0, 1, w=2):**
        *   Preceded by sep? No. Followed by sep? Yes, `sep_idx = 2`.
        *   Rule: `target_start = sep_idx - w + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1`.
        *   Target cols 1-2.
        *   Flip input cols 0-1 vertically. Place in output cols 1-2.
        *   Output grid now has flipped Block 1 in cols 1-2.
    4.  **Process Block 2 (3, 4, w=2):**
        *   Preceded by sep? Yes, `sep_idx = 2`.
        *   Rule: `target_start = sep_idx - w + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1`.
        *   Target cols 1-2.
        *   Flip input cols 3-4 vertically. Place in output cols 1-2 (overwriting previous content).
        *   Final output grid has flipped Block 2 in cols 1-2.
    5.  **Result:** Still doesn't match Example 2 expected output.

*   **Is there a simpler explanation?** What if the separator itself defines the target location?
    *   Ex 1: Block 1 (4-6, w=3) preceded by sep 3. Target 1-3. The block "jumps over" the separator. Start col maps `4 -> 1`. `1 = 3 - (4-3)`. `target_start = sep_idx - (start_col - sep_idx)`? No. `target_start = sep_idx - (w-1)`? `3 - (3-1) = 1`. Works.
    *   Ex 1: Block 2 (8-10, w=3) preceded by sep 7. Target 5-7. `target_start = sep_idx - (w-1)`? `7 - (3-1) = 5`. Works.
    *   Ex 2: Block 1 (0-1, w=2) followed by sep 2. Target 1-2. `target_start = sep_idx - (w-1)`? `2 - (2-1) = 1`. Works.
    *   Ex 2: Block 2 (3-4, w=2) preceded by sep 2. Target 3-4. `target_start = sep_idx - (w-1)`? `2 - (2-1) = 1`. Fails. Expected 3.

*   **Let's focus ONLY on Example 2 Expected Output:**
    *   Block 1 (cols 0-1) moves to cols 1-2.
    *   Block 2 (cols 3-4) moves to cols 3-4 (stays).
    *   Both are flipped vertically.
    *   Maybe the rule is: Find the closest separator. If the block is to the *left* of the separator, it moves one step right. If the block is to the *right* of the separator, it stays put. Always flip vertically.

*   **Seventh Hypothesis:**
    1.  Initialize output grid with background color.
    2.  Identify separator columns and content blocks.
    3.  For each content block (start_col, end_col, width w):
        a.  Extract and vertically flip block data.
        b.  Find the nearest separator column index `sep_idx`. If multiple are equidistant, maybe choose the leftmost? (Need clarification if this occurs). Assume only one relevant separator (immediately adjacent).
        c.  Determine target start column `target_start`:
            i.   If a separator `sep_idx` is adjacent (`sep_idx = start_col - 1` or `sep_idx = end_col + 1`):
                 *   If the block is to the left of the separator (`sep_idx == end_col + 1`), then `target_start = start_col + 1`.
                 *   If the block is to the right of the separator (`sep_idx == start_col - 1`), then `target_start = start_col`.
            ii.  Else (no adjacent separator): `target_start = start_col`.
        d.  Place flipped block at `target_start`.

*   **Testing Seventh Hypothesis:**
    *   **Example 1:**
        *   Block 1 (cols 4-6): Preceded by sep 3 (`sep_idx = start_col - 1`). Block is to the right. Rule (c.i.*): `target_start = start_col = 4`. Target cols 4-6. -> Fails. Expected 1-3.
    *   **Example 2:**
        *   Block 1 (cols 0-1): Followed by sep 2 (`sep_idx = end_col + 1`). Block is to the left. Rule (c.i.*): `target_start = start_col + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`. Target cols 1-2. -> Matches.
        *   Block 2 (cols 3-4): Preceded by sep 2 (`sep_idx = start_col - 1`). Block is to the right. Rule (c.i.*): `target_start = start_col = 3`. Target cols 3-4. -> Matches.
    *   This hypothesis works perfectly for Example 2, but fails completely for Example 1.

*   **Conclusion:** There seems to be a fundamental difference in the transformation rule between Example 1 and Example 2, or my interpretation of "separator" or "block" is flawed.
*   Could the background color change? No, seems to be 0 (white) in both.
*   Could the transformation depend on the *color* of the block? No, Ex 1 is red, Ex 2 is azure. Doesn't seem related.
*   Could it depend on the *shape* of the block? Both are complex shapes made of multiple columns.
*   Could it depend on the *grid size*? Ex 1 is 11x11, Ex 2 is 5x5.

*   **Revisit the original code's logic and failure:** The code implemented `target_start = sep_idx - w + 1` based on Example 1 (where it worked for both blocks) and applied it *only* to the first block. It failed Example 1 because it didn't process the second block. It failed Example 2 because applying that *same rule* to Block 2 (`sep_idx=2, w=2 -> target=1`) gave the wrong target position (expected 3).

*   **Possibility:** The rule `target_start = sep_idx - w + 1` is correct *only* when the separator precedes the block?
    *   Ex 1, Block 1: Preceded by sep 3. `target_start = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1`. Correct.
    *   Ex 1, Block 2: Preceded by sep 7. `target_start = 7 - 3 + 1 = 5`. Correct.
    *   Ex 2, Block 1: Followed by sep 2. Rule doesn't apply. What happens? Target is 1. Original start 0. Shift right by 1.
    *   Ex 2, Block 2: Preceded by sep 2. `target_start = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1`. Incorrect (expected 3).

*   This suggests two different position rules:
    *   Rule A (Separator Precedes Block): `target_start = sep_idx - w + 1`.
    *   Rule B (Separator Follows Block): `target_start = start_col + 1`. (Shift right 1)
    *   Rule C (No Adjacent Separator): `target_start = start_col`. (No shift)

*   **Eighth Hypothesis (Combining Rules):**
    1.  Initialize output grid with background color.
    2.  Identify separator columns and content blocks.
    3.  For each content block (start_col, end_col, width w):
        a.  Extract and vertically flip block data.
        b.  Determine target start column `target_start`:
            i.   If block is preceded by a separator `sep_idx = start_col - 1`: `target_start = sep_idx - w + 1`.
            ii.  Else if block is followed by a separator `sep_idx = end_col + 1`: `target_start = start_col + 1`.
            iii. Else: `target_start = start_col`.
        c.  Place flipped block at `target_start` (handle clipping, overwrite).

*   **Testing Eighth Hypothesis:**
    *   **Example 1:**
        *   Block 1 (cols 4-6, w=3): Preceded by sep 3. Rule (i): `target_start = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1`. Target cols 1-3. -> Matches.
        *   Block 2 (cols 8-10, w=3): Preceded by sep 7. Rule (i): `target_start = 7 - 3 + 1 = 5`. Target cols 5-7. -> Matches.
    *   **Example 2:**
        *   Block 1 (cols 0-1, w=2): Followed by sep 2. Rule (ii): `target_start = 0 + 1 = 1`. Target cols 1-2. -> Matches.
        *   Block 2 (cols 3-4, w=2): Preceded by sep 2. Rule (i): `target_start = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1`. Target cols 1-2. -> Fails. Expected 3-4.

*   **ARRGH.** The rule for Block 2 in Example 2 remains elusive.
    *   Input: cols 3-4. Preceded by sep 2. Width 2.
    *   Output: cols 3-4. Flipped vertically.
    *   It seems that if a block is preceded by a separator, sometimes it moves according to `sep_idx - w + 1` (Ex 1), and sometimes it stays put (Ex 2, Block 2). What's the difference?
    *   Ex 1: Separators are cols 0, 1, 2, 3, 7. Blocks are 4-6 and 8-10. Grid width 11.
    *   Ex 2: Separator is col 2. Blocks are 0-1 and 3-4. Grid width 5.
    *   Is it about the *number* of separators? Or *symmetry*?
    *   Ex 1: Block 1 (4-6) has sep 3 before it. No sep after it until edge. Block 2 (8-10) has sep 7 before it. No sep after it until edge. Both move left based on the preceding sep.
    *   Ex 2: Block 1 (0-1) has no sep before it. Has sep 2 after it. Moves right by 1.
    *   Ex 2: Block 2 (3-4) has sep 2 before it. Has no sep after it. Stays put.

*   **Ninth Hypothesis (Refined Rules based on position relative to separator):**
    1.  Initialize output grid with background color.
    2.  Identify separator columns and content blocks.
    3.  For each content block (start_col, end_col, width w):
        a.  Extract and vertically flip block data.
        b.  Determine target start column `target_start`:
            i.   Check if preceded by sep `sep_idx1 = start_col - 1`.
            ii.  Check if followed by sep `sep_idx2 = end_col + 1`.
            iii. If preceded BUT NOT followed: `target_start = sep_idx1 - w + 1`. (Rule from Ex 1)
            iv.  If followed BUT NOT preceded: `target_start = start_col + 1`. (Rule from Ex 2, Block 1)
            v.   If preceded AND followed: ??? (Not in examples)
            vi.  If NEITHER preceded NOR followed: `target_start = start_col`.
        c.  Place flipped block at `target_start`.

*   **Testing Ninth Hypothesis:**
    *   **Example 1:**
        *   Block 1 (4-6, w=3): Preceded by 3? Yes. Followed by sep? No (next is 7). Rule (iii): `target_start = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1`. -> Matches.
        *   Block 2 (8-10, w=3): Preceded by 7? Yes. Followed by sep? No. Rule (iii): `target_start = 7 - 3 + 1 = 5`. -> Matches.
    *   **Example 2:**
        *   Block 1 (0-1, w=2): Preceded by sep? No. Followed by 2? Yes. Rule (iv): `target_start = 0 + 1 = 1`. -> Matches.
        *   Block 2 (3-4, w=2): Preceded by 2? Yes. Followed by sep? No. Rule (iii): `target_start = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1`. -> Fails! Expected 3.

*   **Final Attempt - Let's trust the results for Example 2.** Rule for Example 2 seems to be: Flip vertically. If block is left of separator, move right 1. If block is right of separator, stay put. Let's call this Rule Set E2.
*   Rule for Example 1 seems to be: Flip vertically. If block is preceded by separator, move left by `w - (sep_idx - (start_col - w))`? No, simpler: `target_start = sep_idx - w + 1`. Let's call this Rule Set E1.
*   Why are the rules different? Maybe there's a global property?
    *   Ex 1 has multiple separators and multiple blocks.
    *   Ex 2 has one separator and two blocks symmetrically placed around it (block | sep | block).
*   Could the rule depend on whether the separator is "central"? In Ex 2, col 2 is the exact center column. In Ex 1, no single separator is central.
*   Could the rule depend on whether blocks exist on *both* sides of a separator? In Ex 2, yes (Block 1 left, Block 2 right of sep 2). In Ex 1, Sep 3 only has Block 1 to its right. Sep 7 only has Block 2 to its right.

*   **Hypothesis X (Symmetry/Context Dependent):**
    1. Initialize output grid with background color.
    2. Identify separator columns and content blocks.
    3. Check for a "symmetric" configuration: Is there exactly one separator column, and are there content blocks immediately adjacent on both sides?
    4. **If Symmetric (like Ex 2):**
        a. For each content block:
            i.  Extract and vertically flip block data.
            ii. If the block is to the *left* of the central separator: `target_start = start_col + 1`.
            iii. If the block is to the *right* of the central separator: `target_start = start_col`.
            iv. Place flipped block at `target_start`.
    5. **Else (Not Symmetric, like Ex 1):**
        a. For each content block:
            i.  Extract and vertically flip block data.
            ii. Determine `target_start`:
                *   If preceded by sep `sep_idx`: `target_start = sep_idx - w + 1`.
                *   If followed by sep `sep_idx` (and not preceded): `target_start = start_col`. (Guessing - no example)
                *   If no adjacent sep: `target_start = start_col`.
            iii. Place flipped block at `target_start`.

*   **Testing Hypothesis X:**
    *   **Example 1 (Not Symmetric):**
        *   Block 1 (4-6, w=3): Preceded by sep 3. Rule (5.a.ii.*): `target_start = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1`. -> Matches.
        *   Block 2 (8-10, w=3): Preceded by sep 7. Rule (5.a.ii.*): `target_start = 7 - 3 + 1 = 5`. -> Matches.
    *   **Example 2 (Symmetric):** Central separator is col 2. Block 1 (0-1) is left. Block 2 (3-4) is right.
        *   Block 1 (0-1, w=2): Left of sep 2. Rule (4.a.ii): `target_start = 0 + 1 = 1`. -> Matches.
        *   Block 2 (3-4, w=2): Right of sep 2. Rule (4.a.iii): `target_start = 3`. -> Matches.

*   This hypothesis works for both examples! Need to refine the "symmetric" condition check and the rules for the non-symmetric case if a block is only followed by a separator. Let's assume for now that if only followed, it stays put (like no adjacent).

*   **Refined Hypothesis X':**
    1. Initialize output grid with background color.
    2. Identify separator columns and content blocks.
    3. **Symmetry Check:**
        a. Is there exactly one separator column index `sep_idx`?
        b. Is `sep_idx > 0` and is `sep_idx - 1` the end column of a block?
        c. Is `sep_idx < width - 1` and is `sep_idx + 1` the start column of a block?
        d. If all true, grid is "symmetric".
    4. **If Symmetric:** Apply Rule Set E2.
        a. For each block: Flip vertically. If left of `sep_idx`, `target = start+1`. If right of `sep_idx`, `target = start`. Place.
    5. **Else (Not Symmetric):** Apply Rule Set E1 (modified).
        a. For each block: Flip vertically. If preceded by sep `s_idx`, `target = s_idx - w + 1`. Else `target = start`. Place.
    6. Return output grid.

This looks like the most promising approach.**General Assessment:**

The provided code implements a transformation based on observations from only the first example. It correctly identifies the vertical flip and repositioning relative to a preceding separator for that example's blocks. However, it fails because:
1.  It only processes the *first* content block found, whereas Example 1 requires processing *all* content blocks.
2.  The repositioning rule derived from Example 1 (`target_start = sep_idx - width + 1`) does not apply correctly to all cases in Example 2. Example 2 suggests a different positioning logic might be needed depending on whether the separator precedes or follows the block, and potentially based on the overall structure (symmetry).

**Strategy:**

1.  Analyze both examples to find a consistent rule set that explains the transformations in *both* cases.
2.  Identify objects: separator columns (columns of background color) and content blocks (contiguous columns with non-background colors).
3.  Identify actions: vertical flipping of content blocks, repositioning of content blocks.
4.  Hypothesize transformation rules based on the relationship between content blocks and adjacent separator columns. Test hypotheses against both examples.
5.  The key seems to be that *all* content blocks are processed, each is flipped vertically, and its target position depends on its relationship to adjacent separators and potentially the overall grid configuration (e.g., symmetry around a single separator).
6.  Refine the natural language program to describe the rule that works for both examples.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

**Example 1:**

*   Input Grid: 11x11
*   Background Color: 0 (white)
*   Separator Columns (all white): {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
*   Content Blocks (columns): Block A: (4, 5, 6), Width=3; Block B: (8, 9, 10), Width=3
*   Transformations:
    *   Block A: Flipped vertically. Preceded by separator col 3. Expected target: cols 1, 2, 3. (Position calculation: `target_start = sep_idx - width + 1 = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1`)
    *   Block B: Flipped vertically. Preceded by separator col 7. Expected target: cols 5, 6, 7. (Position calculation: `target_start = sep_idx - width + 1 = 7 - 3 + 1 = 5`)
*   Code Failure: Only processed Block A. Applied correct flip and positioning rule *for Block A*.

**Example 2:**

*   Input Grid: 5x5
*   Background Color: 0 (white)
*   Separator Columns (all white): {2}
*   Content Blocks (columns): Block A: (0, 1), Width=2; Block B: (3, 4), Width=2
*   Transformations:
    *   Block A: Flipped vertically. Followed by separator col 2. Expected target: cols 1, 2. (Shift right by 1).
    *   Block B: Flipped vertically. Preceded by separator col 2. Expected target: cols 3, 4. (No shift).
*   Code Failure: Only processed Block A. Applied the positioning rule from Ex 1 (`target_start = sep_idx - width + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1`), which happened to work for Block A but would *not* work for Block B (it would also incorrectly place Block B at cols 1, 2).

**Correction:** My manual analysis of Example 1 Block 1 was slightly off; it *is* followed by separator column 7, although it's not *immediately* adjacent in the sense of `end+1`. However, the symmetry check logic works correctly. Example 1 is not symmetric, Example 2 is. This supports Hypothesis X'.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Transforms column-based blocks within a grid based on adjacency to separator columns.

grid_properties:
  background_color: 0 # white
  objects:
    - type: separator_column
      definition: A grid column composed entirely of the background color.
    - type: content_block
      definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more columns containing at least one non-background pixel.
      properties:
        - start_column_index
        - end_column_index
        - width (number of columns)
        - data (2D array of pixel values)

transformations:
  - action: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_separator_columns, list_of_content_blocks

  - action: check_symmetry
    inputs: list_of_separator_columns, list_of_content_blocks, grid_width
    outputs: is_symmetric (boolean)
    # Symmetry condition: Exactly one separator column exists, and it has content blocks immediately adjacent on both its left and right sides.

  - action: process_blocks
    inputs: list_of_content_blocks, list_of_separator_columns, is_symmetric
    outputs: modified_output_grid
    steps:
      # Initialize output grid with background color.
      # For each content_block:
      # 1. Extract block data from input grid.
      # 2. Flip block data vertically.
      # 3. Determine target_start_column based on symmetry:
      #    IF is_symmetric:
      #      Find the single separator column index `sep_idx`.
      #      IF block.end_column_index == sep_idx - 1 (block is left):
      #        target_start_column = block.start_column_index + 1
      #      ELSE IF block.start_column_index == sep_idx + 1 (block is right):
      #        target_start_column = block.start_column_index
      #    ELSE (not symmetric):
      #      IF block is preceded by a separator `sep_idx = block.start_column_index - 1`:
      #        target_start_column = sep_idx - block.width + 1
      #      ELSE: # Covers not preceded (including followed only, or no adjacent sep)
      #        target_start_column = block.start_column_index
      # 4. Calculate target_end_column = target_start_column + block.width - 1
      # 5. Place flipped block data onto output grid in target columns, handling bounds/clipping.

output_grid:
  source: Generated by placing transformed blocks onto an initial background grid.
  properties: Same dimensions as input grid. Contains the vertically flipped and repositioned content blocks.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Define the background color as white (0).
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color.
3.  Identify all "separator columns" in the input grid, which are columns consisting solely of the background color.
4.  Identify all "content blocks" in the input grid, which are maximal contiguous horizontal sequences of columns that are *not* separator columns. Record each block's start column, end column, and width.
5.  Determine if the grid configuration is "symmetric": This occurs if and only if there is exactly one separator column, and there is a content block immediately to its left (ending at `separator_column - 1`) AND a content block immediately to its right (starting at `separator_column + 1`).
6.  Iterate through each identified content block:
    a.  Extract the pixel data corresponding to this block's columns from the input grid.
    b.  Flip this extracted block data vertically (upside-down).
    c.  Determine the target start column for placing the flipped block in the output grid based on the symmetry check:
        i.  **If the grid is symmetric:** Let `sep_idx` be the index of the single separator column. If the current block is the one immediately to the left of the separator (`block_end_column == sep_idx - 1`), the target start column is `block_start_column + 1`. If the current block is the one immediately to the right of the separator (`block_start_column == sep_idx + 1`), the target start column is the block's original `block_start_column`.
        ii. **If the grid is not symmetric:** Check if the block is immediately preceded by a separator column (`sep_idx = block_start_column - 1`). If yes, the target start column is `sep_idx - block_width + 1`. If the block is *not* immediately preceded by a separator column, the target start column is the block's original `block_start_column`.
    d.  Calculate the target end column based on the target start column and the block's width.
    e.  Place the vertically flipped block data into the output grid at the calculated target columns. Ensure placement respects grid boundaries (clipping if necessary). Overwrite any existing pixels in the target location (important if target positions overlap, though this doesn't seem to occur in the examples with this logic).
7.  Return the completed output grid.
