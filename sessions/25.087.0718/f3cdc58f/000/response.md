Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure**: The input is a 10x10 grid containing pixels of various colors, primarily white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4). The non-white pixels appear scattered throughout the grid without an immediately obvious pattern in their placement.
2.  **Output Structure**: The output is also a 10x10 grid. It is predominantly white (0). There is a distinct structure in the bottom-left corner composed of vertical columns of colors blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4), located in columns 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
3.  **Transformation Logic**: The transformation appears to involve analyzing the *counts* of specific colors in the input grid. The height of each colored column in the output grid seems directly related to the total number of pixels of that specific color found in the input grid.
4.  **Color Mapping**: Blue pixels (1) in the input relate to the blue column (column 0) in the output. Red pixels (2) relate to the red column (column 1), Green pixels (3) relate to the green column (column 2), and Yellow pixels (4) relate to the yellow column (column 3).
5.  **Output Column Alignment**: The colored columns in the output are bottom-aligned. That is, they all end at the last row (row 9) and extend upwards for a height determined by the counts from the input.
6.  **Ignored Information**: The positions of the colored pixels in the input grid do not seem to affect the output, only their total counts for colors 1, 2, 3, and 4 matter. White pixels (0) and any other potential colors are ignored in the input for determining the output structure.

**Facts**


```yaml
Context:
  - Input and output grids are 10x10.
  - The task focuses on colors blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4).

Input Analysis:
  - Objects: Pixels with colors 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  - Properties:
    - Color: The specific value (1, 2, 3, or 4).
    - Count: The total number of pixels for each specific color (1, 2, 3, 4) across the entire input grid.
  - Relationships: The location of input pixels is irrelevant to the transformation logic.

Output Construction:
  - Base: A 10x10 grid initialized with white (0).
  - Elements: Vertical columns potentially drawn in columns 0, 1, 2, and 3.
  - Column Properties:
    - Column Index: 0, 1, 2, 3.
    - Color: Determined by (Index + 1). (Col 0 -> Blue(1), Col 1 -> Red(2), Col 2 -> Green(3), Col 3 -> Yellow(4)).
    - Height: Determined by the count of the corresponding color's pixels in the input grid.
    - Alignment: All columns are bottom-aligned, extending upwards from row 9.
    - Start Row: Calculated as `GridHeight - ColumnHeight`.

Transformation:
  - Action: Count the occurrences of each target color (1, 2, 3, 4) in the input.
  - Action: For each target color `C` with count `N`:
    - Identify the target column index `I = C - 1`.
    - Calculate the start row `R_start = 10 - N`.
    - Fill the cells in the output grid at column `I` from row `R_start` to row 9 (inclusive) with color `C`.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new 10x10 output grid and fill it entirely with the background color, white (0).
2.  Examine the input grid and count the total number of blue (1) pixels. Let this count be `Count_Blue`.
3.  Count the total number of red (2) pixels in the input grid. Let this count be `Count_Red`.
4.  Count the total number of green (3) pixels in the input grid. Let this count be `Count_Green`.
5.  Count the total number of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. Let this count be `Count_Yellow`.
6.  If `Count_Blue` is greater than 0:
    *   Calculate the starting row index for the blue column: `StartRow_Blue = 10 - Count_Blue`.
    *   In the output grid, fill the cells in column 0 from `StartRow_Blue` down to row 9 (inclusive) with the color blue (1).
7.  If `Count_Red` is greater than 0:
    *   Calculate the starting row index for the red column: `StartRow_Red = 10 - Count_Red`.
    *   In the output grid, fill the cells in column 1 from `StartRow_Red` down to row 9 (inclusive) with the color red (2).
8.  If `Count_Green` is greater than 0:
    *   Calculate the starting row index for the green column: `StartRow_Green = 10 - Count_Green`.
    *   In the output grid, fill the cells in column 2 from `StartRow_Green` down to row 9 (inclusive) with the color green (3).
9.  If `Count_Yellow` is greater than 0:
    *   Calculate the starting row index for the yellow column: `StartRow_Yellow = 10 - Count_Yellow`.
    *   In the output grid, fill the cells in column 3 from `StartRow_Yellow` down to row 9 (inclusive) with the color yellow (4).
10. The resulting grid is the final output.
