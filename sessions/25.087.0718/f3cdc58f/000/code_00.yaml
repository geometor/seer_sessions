Context:
  - Input and output grids are 10x10.
  - The task focuses on colors blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4).

Input Analysis:
  - Objects: Pixels with colors 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  - Properties:
    - Color: The specific value (1, 2, 3, or 4).
    - Count: The total number of pixels for each specific color (1, 2, 3, 4) across the entire input grid.
  - Relationships: The location of input pixels is irrelevant to the transformation logic.

Output Construction:
  - Base: A 10x10 grid initialized with white (0).
  - Elements: Vertical columns potentially drawn in columns 0, 1, 2, and 3.
  - Column Properties:
    - Column Index: 0, 1, 2, 3.
    - Color: Determined by (Index + 1). (Col 0 -> Blue(1), Col 1 -> Red(2), Col 2 -> Green(3), Col 3 -> Yellow(4)).
    - Height: Determined by the count of the corresponding color's pixels in the input grid.
    - Alignment: All columns are bottom-aligned, extending upwards from row 9.
    - Start Row: Calculated as `GridHeight - ColumnHeight`.

Transformation:
  - Action: Count the occurrences of each target color (1, 2, 3, 4) in the input.
  - Action: For each target color `C` with count `N`:
    - Identify the target column index `I = C - 1`.
    - Calculate the start row `R_start = 10 - N`.
    - Fill the cells in the output grid at column `I` from row `R_start` to row 9 (inclusive) with color `C`.
