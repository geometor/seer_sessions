            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure**: The input is a 10x10 grid containing pixels of various colors, primarily white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4). The non-white pixels appear scattered throughout the grid without an immediately obvious pattern in their placement.\n2.  **Output Structure**: The output is also a 10x10 grid. It is predominantly white (0). There is a distinct structure in the bottom-left corner composed of vertical columns of colors blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4), located in columns 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively.\n3.  **Transformation Logic**: The transformation appears to involve analyzing the *counts* of specific colors in the input grid. The height of each colored column in the output grid seems directly related to the total number of pixels of that specific color found in the input grid.\n4.  **Color Mapping**: Blue pixels (1) in the input relate to the blue column (column 0) in the output. Red pixels (2) relate to the red column (column 1), Green pixels (3) relate to the green column (column 2), and Yellow pixels (4) relate to the yellow column (column 3).\n5.  **Output Column Alignment**: The colored columns in the output are bottom-aligned. That is, they all end at the last row (row 9) and extend upwards for a height determined by the counts from the input.\n6.  **Ignored Information**: The positions of the colored pixels in the input grid do not seem to affect the output, only their total counts for colors 1, 2, 3, and 4 matter. White pixels (0) and any other potential colors are ignored in the input for determining the output structure.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
