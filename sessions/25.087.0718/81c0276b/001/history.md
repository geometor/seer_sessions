*   **Perception:** The input grid is structured like a larger grid divided by single-color horizontal and vertical lines (separators). Within the cells formed by these separators, there are distinct 2x2 blocks of color. The task involves identifying these 2x2 blocks, analyzing their colors (excluding the separator color), determining the frequency of each color, and then constructing an output grid based on these frequencies. The output grid summarizes the color frequencies, with each row representing a unique color, ordered by increasing frequency, and the number of times the color appears in the row matching its frequency count.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - grid_structure:
          type: partitioned grid
          properties:
            - separator_lines: single horizontal and vertical lines of a uniform color
            - content_cells: rectangular areas defined by the separator lines
            - cell_content: typically contains one 2x2 block of a solid color
      - objects:
          - separator_line:
              property: color (uniform for all separators in one input)
          - colored_block:
              property: 2x2 size
              property: solid color
              location: within a content_cell
      - analysis:
          - identify separator color
          - identify content cells based on separators
          - map each content cell to the color of the 2x2 block within it (create intermediate grid)
          - count frequency of each block color in the intermediate grid (excluding the separator color and background color 0)
      - output_construction:
          - determine output dimensions:
              rows: number of unique non-separator/non-background colors found
              columns: maximum frequency count among those colors
          - sort unique colors by their frequency (ascending)
          - create output grid row by row:
              for each sorted color:
                fill row start with N instances of the color (where N is its frequency)
                pad rest of the row with background color (0)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the single color C used for all full horizontal and vertical separator lines in the input grid.
    2.  Determine the grid structure defined by these separator lines, identifying the boundaries of the 'content cells' located between the separators.
    3.  Create an intermediate representation (e.g., a list or grid) storing the color of the 2x2 block found within each content cell. Scan each cell (top-left to bottom-right) and record the color of the first 2x2 block encountered.
    4.  Count the frequency of each color appearing in the intermediate representation, ignoring the separator color C and the background color 0. Store these colors and their frequencies.
    5.  Sort the unique colors found in step 4 based on their frequency in ascending order.
    6.  Determine the dimensions of the output grid:
        *   Number of rows = the count of unique colors found in step 4.
        *   Number of columns = the maximum frequency value calculated in step 4.
    7.  Construct the output grid:
        *   Initialize an empty grid with the determined dimensions, filled with the background color 0.
        *   Iterate through the sorted colors (from step 5). For each color `X` with frequency `N`:
            *   Fill the next available row in the output grid, starting from the first column, with `N` instances of color `X`.
