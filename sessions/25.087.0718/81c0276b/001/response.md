"""
Identifies a separator color forming a grid structure with a consistent interval.
Extracts the color of 2x2 blocks found within each cell of this structure.
Counts the frequency of each extracted block color (ignoring background and separator colors).
Constructs an output grid where each row corresponds to a unique block color, sorted by frequency (ascending).
Each row contains N instances of the color, where N is its frequency, padded with background color 0.
