Within the cells formed by these separators, there are distinct 2x2 blocks of color. The task involves identifying these 2x2 blocks, analyzing their colors (excluding the separator color), determining the frequency of each color, and then constructing an output grid based on these frequencies. The output grid summarizes the color frequencies, with each row representing a unique color, ordered by increasing frequency, and the number of times the color appears in the row matching its frequency count.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
