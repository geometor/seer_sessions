            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid contains scattered single pixels of one color (gray '5' in train_1, blue '1' in train_2, red '2' in train_3) and a solid line (horizontal or vertical) of azure '8' pixels. The rest of the grid is white '0'.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the azure '8' line in its original position. The scattered pixels from the input are either removed or relocated near the azure line. The background remains white '0'.\n3.  **Transformation:** The azure '8' line acts as a barrier or separator. The transformation depends on the orientation of this line:\n    *   **Horizontal Azure Line (train_1, train_3):** Pixels of the scattered color located *above* the azure line in the input are removed in the output. Pixels of the scattered color located *below* the azure line are moved vertically upwards, stacking against the row immediately *above* the azure line, maintaining their original columns. The lowest pixel in a column lands directly above the line, the next lowest lands above that, and so on.\n    *   **Vertical Azure Line (train_2):** Pixels of the scattered color located *to the left* of the azure line in the input are removed in the output. Pixels of the scattered color located *to the right* of the azure line are moved horizontally leftwards, stacking against the column immediately *to the right* of the azure line, maintaining their original rows. The leftmost pixel in a row lands directly to the right of the line, the next leftmost lands to the right of that, and so on.\n4.  **Key Colors:** The azure '8' color defines the static barrier. The other non-white color (5, 1, or 2) represents the mobile objects subject to the rule. White '0' is the background.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
