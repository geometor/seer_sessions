            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 10x10 grids.\n2.  **Colors:** The key colors are white (0), blue (1), red (2), and gray (5).\n3.  **Static Elements:** The gray (5) pixels remain unchanged between the input and output grids in all examples. They appear to function as fixed boundaries or walls.\n4.  **Dynamic Elements:** The white (0) pixels in the input are always changed to either blue (1) or red (2) in the output. The original blue (1) and red (2) pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves filling the areas of white (0) pixels. The color used for filling seems determined by the nearby non-white, non-gray pixels (blue or red) present in the input grid.\n6.  **Mechanism:** It looks like a \"territory\" or \"influence\" spread. The blue (1) and red (2) pixels from the input act as sources. They \"claim\" adjacent white (0) pixels. This claim propagates outwards, like a flood fill, but is blocked by the gray (5) walls. Each white (0) pixel takes the color of the \"closest\" source pixel (blue or red). Closeness is likely measured by Manhattan distance, navigating around the gray walls.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Identify all source pixels (blue and/or red) that are at this minimum distance.\n    d.  If there is only one source pixel at the minimum distance, or if all source pixels at the minimum distance have the same color, fill the target pixel in the output grid with that color (blue or red).\n    e.  *(Assumption based on examples)* The examples suggest that ties in distance between different colors might not occur or have a consistent resolution (e.g., one color might have priority, or the closest source is always unique). The primary rule observed is that the target pixel takes the color of the uniquely closest source.\n6.  Return the modified output grid."
