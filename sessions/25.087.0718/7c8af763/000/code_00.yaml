task_type: fill
grid_properties:
  size: 10x10
colors:
  background: 0 # white
  fill_options: [1, 2] # blue, red
  walls: 5 # gray
  sources: [1, 2] # blue, red
objects:
  - type: wall
    color: 5 # gray
    behavior: static, blocks propagation
  - type: source
    color: [1, 2] # blue, red
    behavior: static, source of color propagation
  - type: fillable_area
    color: 0 # white
    behavior: gets filled based on nearest source
transformation:
  rule: nearest_source_fill
  distance_metric: Manhattan
  constraints: walls (color 5) are impassable
input_output_relationship:
  - input_color_0: transformed to color 1 or 2
  - input_color_1: remains color 1
  - input_color_2: remains color 2
  - input_color_5: remains color 5
uncertainties:
  - tie_breaking: How to handle cases where a white pixel is equidistant from a blue source and a red source. (Examples provided do not seem to explicitly test this). Assumed closest distance wins uniquely based on examples.
