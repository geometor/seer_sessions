Transformation Rule Hypothesis (Incomplete):

Fills background pixels (White=0) with the color of the 'nearest' source pixel 
(Blue=1 or Red=2), navigating around obstacles (Gray=5). Distance is calculated 
using Manhattan distance. Gray obstacles are impassable.

A multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) is performed starting simultaneously 
from all source pixels. 

Conflict Resolution Hypothesis:
1. If a White pixel is reached by a path from one source color faster (shorter 
   Manhattan distance) than any path from the other source color, it takes the 
   color of the faster source.
2. If a White pixel is reached by paths of equal minimum distance from both a 
   Blue source and a Red source, Red (2) takes precedence, and the pixel is 
   colored Red.

Known Discrepancy: This hypothesis, particularly the simple minimum distance 
rule, does not fully account for the patterns observed in the provided examples. 
The expected outputs sometimes assign colors corresponding to sources that are 
demonstrably farther (by Manhattan distance) than sources of the competing color. 
The exact mechanism or potential additional factors influencing the color 
assignment remain unclear based on the examples.

Implementation Notes:
- The code implements the BFS approach with the Red-over-Blue tie-breaking rule 
  described above.
- Pixels that are not White (0), Blue (1), Red (2), or Gray (5) remain unchanged.
- Blue, Red, and Gray pixels from the input remain unchanged in the output.
