Distance is calculated \nusing Manhattan distance. Gray obstacles are impassable.\n\nA multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) is performed starting simultaneously \nfrom all source pixels. \n\nConflict Resolution Hypothesis:\n1. If a White pixel is reached by a path from one source color faster (shorter \n   Manhattan distance) than any path from the other source color, it takes the \n   color of the faster source.\n2. If a White pixel is reached by paths of equal minimum distance from both a \n   Blue source and a Red source, Red (2) takes precedence, and the pixel is \n   colored Red.\n\nKnown Discrepancy: This hypothesis, particularly the simple minimum distance \nrule, does not fully account for the patterns observed in the provided examples. \nThe expected outputs sometimes assign colors corresponding to sources that are \ndemonstrably farther (by Manhattan distance) than sources of the competing color. \nThe exact mechanism or potential additional factors influencing the color \nassignment remain unclear based on the examples.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- The code implements the BFS approach with the Red-over-Blue tie-breaking rule \n  described above.\n- Pixels that are not White (0), Blue (1), Red (2), or Gray (5) remain unchanged.\n- Blue, Red, and Gray pixels from the input remain unchanged in the output.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fills white areas based on the nearest blue or red source using BFS, \n    blocked by gray walls, with Red > Blue tie-breaking for equal distances.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): A 2D list representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: A 2D list representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_np)\n    \n    # Get grid dimensions\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n\n    # Define colors\n    WHITE = 0\n    BLUE = 1\n    RED = 2\n    GRAY = 5\n\n    # Initialize distance grid with infinity\n    # Stores the shortest distance found so far from *any* source\n    distance_grid = np.full((height, width), float('inf'), dtype=float)\n    # Initialize color grid to store the color of the source corresponding \n    # to the shortest path found so far.
