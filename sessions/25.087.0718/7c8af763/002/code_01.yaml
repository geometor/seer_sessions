task_description: Fill background areas based on proximity to sources of two different colors, respecting obstacles.

input_features:
  grid_dimensions: Variable (e.g., 10x10 in examples).
  pixel_colors:
    - 0: White (Background to be filled)
    - 1: Blue (Source type 1)
    - 2: Red (Source type 2)
    - 5: Gray (Obstacle/Wall)
  pixels:
    - sources: Individual pixels colored Blue(1) or Red(2).
    - obstacles: Individual pixels colored Gray(5). They block movement/influence.
    - background: Individual pixels colored White(0).

output_features:
  grid_dimensions: Same as input.
  pixel_colors: Same palette as input (0, 1, 2, 5), but White(0) pixels are replaced by Blue(1) or Red(2).
  pixels:
    - source pixels: Remain unchanged from input.
    - obstacle pixels: Remain unchanged from input.
    - filled pixels: Originally White(0) pixels are now Blue(1) or Red(2).

transformation:
  type: Region filling / Nearest neighbor assignment (Voronoi diagram variant).
  action: Each White(0) pixel is assigned the color (Blue or Red) of the 'nearest' source pixel.
  distance_metric: Assumed to be Manhattan distance, but direct application fails to match examples. Obstacles (Gray) are impassable.
  conflict_resolution:
    - Multiple sources of the same color: The closest one determines the distance.
    - Sources of different colors: The assignment rule is unclear.
      - Hypothesis 1: Assign color of the source with the minimum Manhattan distance. (Fails on examples).
      - Hypothesis 2: If distances are equal, Red(2) takes precedence over Blue(1). (Partially addresses some ties, but fails on non-tie errors).
    - Observation: The expected output often assigns a color even when a source of the opposite color is closer via Manhattan distance. The exact rule remains unidentified.

uncertainties:
  - The precise rule for determining which source (Blue or Red) influences a given White pixel, especially when the nearest-source-by-Manhattan-distance rule is violated in the expected outputs.
  - The correct tie-breaking mechanism when a pixel is equidistant from the nearest Blue source and the nearest Red source.
