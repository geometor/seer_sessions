However, it failed because it assumed a direct, unaltered copy of the source pattern. The discrepancies between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` consistently show that the pattern placed in the target area is not identical to the source pattern in its original orientation.\n\nThe analysis reveals a consistent transformation: the source pattern is **flipped horizontally** (mirrored across its vertical axis) before being placed into the target white area. The strategy needs to be updated to include this horizontal flip operation after extracting the source pattern and before pasting it into the target location.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze each example to confirm the horizontal flip pattern.\n\n"
