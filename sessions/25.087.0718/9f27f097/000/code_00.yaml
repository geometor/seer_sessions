task_description: Copy a source pattern into a target white region within a grid.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors 0-9.
  - element: background_pixel
    description: The pixel color that fills most of the grid and surrounds distinct regions. It's not white (0).
  - element: pattern_region
    description: A rectangular subgrid containing a mix of non-background, non-white pixels. It is surrounded by background pixels.
    properties:
      - location: Coordinates (top-left, bottom-right) within the main grid.
      - content: The actual pattern of pixels within the region, excluding any surrounding background border.
      - size: Height and width of the content pattern.
  - element: white_region
    description: A rectangular subgrid filled entirely with white (0) pixels. It is surrounded by non-white pixels (typically background pixels).
    properties:
      - location: Coordinates (top-left, bottom-right) within the main grid.
      - content: All pixels are white (0).
      - size: Height and width.

relationships:
  - relation: spatial_separation
    description: The pattern_region and white_region are distinct and do not overlap in the input grid.
  - relation: size_match
    description: The height and width of the pattern_region's content must exactly match the height and width of the white_region.
  - relation: framing
    description: Both the pattern_region (potentially including a border) and the white_region are embedded within the background_pixel color.

actions:
  - action: identify_background
    description: Determine the background pixel color (the most common non-white color or the color framing the regions).
  - action: locate_pattern_region
    description: Find the bounding box of the region containing non-background, non-white pixels.
  - action: extract_pattern
    description: Isolate the actual pattern content from the pattern_region (excluding any surrounding background border).
  - action: locate_white_region
    description: Find the bounding box of the rectangular area composed solely of white (0) pixels.
  - action: copy_paste
    description: Replace the content of the white_region in the output grid with the extracted_pattern, maintaining orientation and starting from the top-left corner of the white_region.
  - action: preserve
    description: Keep all other pixels (background, original pattern region) unchanged from the input to the output grid.
