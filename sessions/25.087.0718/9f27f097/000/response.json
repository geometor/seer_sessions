This pattern region is often surrounded by a border of the background color.\n    *   Another region is a solid rectangle filled entirely with white pixels (color 0), also surrounded by the background color.\n3.  **Background Color:** There's a dominant background color filling most of the grid area outside the pattern and white regions. This background color is consistent within each example (red for 1 & 2, blue for 3).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve copying the pattern from the first region into the white region.\n5.  **Invariance:** The background color, the border pixels, and the original pattern region remain unchanged in the output. Only the white region is modified.\n6.  **Copy Operation:** The pattern is copied exactly, preserving its internal structure, colors, and orientation. The size of the source pattern region matches the size of the target white region in all examples.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Let its top-left corner coordinates be (target_row, target_col).\n5.  Verify that the dimensions (height and width) of the extracted source pattern exactly match the dimensions of the white region.\n6.  Iterate through the pixels of the extracted source pattern.
