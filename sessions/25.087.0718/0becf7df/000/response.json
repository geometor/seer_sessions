            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Input and output are grids of pixels with different colors (represented by numbers 0-9). The background is white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** Each grid contains multiple distinct \"objects,\" which are contiguous areas of non-white pixels. In all examples, there seem to be exactly two main objects.\n3.  **Object Characteristics:** Objects have varying shapes and contain multiple colors.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the colors within *one* of the objects, leaving the other object and the background unchanged.\n5.  **Identifying the Target Object:** The object that gets modified is consistently the one whose bounding box *does not* include the top-left corner (0,0). The object whose bounding box *does* include (0,0) remains unchanged.\n6.  **Color Modification:** The modification involves swapping pairs of colors within the target object.\n7.  **Determining Swap Pairs:** The specific colors involved in the swaps, and how they are paired, appears to be determined by the set of unique non-white colors present in the *unchanged* object (the one at the top-left). All examples show exactly four unique non-white colors in this object.\n8.  **Pairing Logic:** Let the four unique colors from the unchanged object, sorted numerically, be `c1, c2, c3, c4`.\n    *   If `c1 + c4 == c2 + c3`, the swaps applied to the target object are `c1 <-> c4` and `c2 <-> c3`. (Example 3)\n    *   Otherwise, the swaps applied to the target object are `c1 <-> c3` and `c2 <-> c4`. (Examples 1 and 2)\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"
