            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully solved the first three examples but failed on the fourth. The failure occurred because the code assumed the target object must have a *uniform, single-color border*. Example 4 presented an input where the relevant object has multiple colors along its border.\n\nThe transformed output for Example 4 being empty indicates that the `find_target_object` function returned `None`, failing to identify any object meeting the strict criteria. However, comparing the input and expected output for Example 4 reveals:\n1.  The output corresponds to a specific, largest connected object in the input.\n2.  The color transformations applied to this object match the rules previously defined for a *Blue (1)* border, even though the actual border has multiple colors (Blue (1), Yellow (4), Azure (8)).\n\nThis suggests the core transformation logic based on a single \"characteristic\" color is likely correct, but the method for determining that characteristic color needs revision. Instead of requiring a uniform border, the characteristic color seems to be derived from the border pixels in a different way, potentially the *most frequent* color among the pixels adjacent to the background or grid edges.\n\n## Strategy for Resolution\n\n1.  **Modify Object Identification:** Remove the requirement for a uniform border color. Instead, identify all connected non-background objects and select the \"target\" object, likely the one with the largest pixel count.\n2.  **Determine Characteristic Color:** For the selected target object, identify its \"border pixels\" (those adjacent to background/edge). Calculate the frequency of each color among these border pixels. The color with the highest frequency will be considered the \"characteristic color\" that dictates the transformation rules. Handle ties if necessary (e.g., lowest color value, though ties don't occur in the examples).\n3.  **Apply Transformation:** Use the determined characteristic color and the existing `transform_color` function logic to transform *all* pixels within the target object (not just interior ones as previously interpreted, as Example 4 transforms border pixels too).\n4.  **Crop and Output:** Extract the transformed target object based on its bounding box.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze each example using the new strategy.\n\n"

Consider pixels connected if they touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n2.  Select the object with the largest number of pixels as the \"target object\". If there's a tie in size, the selection criteria don't matter based on the examples, but a tie-breaking rule (e.g., object with the top-most, left-most bounding box corner) could be used if needed.\n3.  Determine the \"border pixels\" of the target object. These are the pixels within the target object that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any background pixel (color 0) or the edge of the grid.\n4.  Find the \"characteristic color\" by identifying the color that appears most frequently among these border pixels. If there's a tie in frequency, choose the color with the lowest numerical value (though ties are not observed in the examples).\n5.  Create a new output grid whose dimensions match the bounding box of the target object.\n6.  Iterate through each pixel coordinate within the bounding box of the target object.\n7.
