"""
Identifies a specific target object within the input grid, characterized by a 
uniform, single-color border enclosing an interior region. Extracts this target 
object. Transforms the colors of the interior pixels based on the color of the 
border (Border Color, BC), while keeping the border pixels unchanged. The 
transformation rules depend on the BC:
- If BC=Azure(8): Swap Red(2)<->Green(3), Swap Blue(1)<->Yellow(4).
- If BC=Green(3): Blue(1)->Red(2), Gray(5)->Yellow(4), Azure(8)->Magenta(6).
- If BC=Blue(1): Yellow(4)->Red(2), Azure(8)->Green(3).
Other interior colors or colors matching the BC remain unchanged. 
The output grid contains only the transformed target object, cropped to its 
bounding box.
