One specific object in each input appears to be the target for transformation. This target object is characterized by having a solid, single-color border enclosing an inner pattern. The other objects in the input are ignored. The output grid is a cropped version of the input, containing only the target object. The colors within the interior of the target object are transformed based on a rule that depends on the color of the object's border. The border color itself remains unchanged in the output.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Find the unique object that possesses a solid, uniform-colored border completely enclosing an interior area. This is the \"target object\". Determine its \"Border Color\" (BC).\n    3.  Determine the bounding box of the target object. The output grid will have the dimensions of this bounding box.\n    4.  Create the output grid by copying the target object (border and interior) into it.\n    5.  Iterate through each pixel location within the bounding box of the target object in the output grid.\n    6.  For each pixel, check if it belongs to the interior of the target object (i.e., it is not part of the uniform-colored border).\n    7.  If the pixel is part of the interior:\n        a.  Get its original color (OC) from the corresponding position in the input grid's target object.\n        b.  Apply a color transformation based on the Border Color (BC):\n            i.

If BC is Green (3): Change Blue (1) to Red (2); change Gray (5) to Yellow (4); change Azure (8) to Magenta (6).\n            iii.If BC is Blue (1): Change Yellow (4) to Red (2); change Azure (8) to Green (3).\n            iv. If the original color (OC) is not involved in the transformations defined for the specific BC, or if OC is the same as BC, leave the pixel's color unchanged (it remains OC).\n    8.  If the pixel is part of the border (its color is BC and it forms the enclosing border), leave its color unchanged (it remains BC).\n    9.  The resulting grid is the final output."
