  - name: modify_grid
    input: input_grid, identified_objects, paths
    output: output_grid
    details:
      - Initialize output grid from input.
      - For each dynamic pixel:
        - Set its original location in the output grid to white (0).
        - For each coordinate in its calculated path:
          - Set the pixel at that coordinate in the output grid to the dynamic pixel's color.
      - Static objects (red blocks) remain unchanged.
relationships:
  - The movement direction of a single pixel object is determined solely by its color.
  - The movement path stops at the grid boundaries.
  - Static objects (red blocks) are not affected by the movement of dynamic pixels.
