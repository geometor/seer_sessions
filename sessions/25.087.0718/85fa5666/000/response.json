            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of varying sizes, filled with colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9). White (0) serves as the background.\n2.  **Object Types:** There appear to be two main types of non-background objects:\n    *   Single, isolated pixels of various colors (Green, Magenta, Orange, Azure).\n    *   2x2 blocks of Red pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the movement of the single pixels. The 2x2 Red blocks seem stationary and unaffected.\n4.  **Movement Pattern:** The single pixels move diagonally outwards from their original position towards the edges of the grid.\n5.  **Trail Creation:** As a pixel moves, it leaves a trail of copies of itself along its diagonal path.\n6.  **Original Pixel:** The pixel at the original starting location disappears (becomes white).\n7.  **Directionality:** The direction of diagonal movement appears to be specific to the color of the single pixel:\n    *   Green (3) moves Top-Right.\n    *   Magenta (6) moves Bottom-Right.\n    *   Orange (7) moves Bottom-Left.\n    *   Azure (8) moves Top-Left.\n8.  **Boundaries:** The movement and trail creation stop when the edge of the grid is reached.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
