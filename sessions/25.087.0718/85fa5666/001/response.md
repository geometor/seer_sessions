```python
import numpy as np

"""
Identify single pixels of specific colors (Green=3, Magenta=6, Orange=7, Azure=8) 
in the input grid. For each such pixel, determine its diagonal movement direction 
based on its color: Green moves Top-Right, Magenta moves Bottom-Right, Orange 
moves Bottom-Left, and Azure moves Top-Left. 
Clear the pixel's original location in the output grid. Then, trace a path from 
the adjacent diagonal cell in the determined direction until the grid boundary 
is reached, filling each cell along this path (including the first diagonal step) 
with the pixel's original color. Other elements in the grid (like 2x2 Red blocks) 
remain unchanged.

    Transforms the input grid by moving specific colored pixels diagonally
    and leaving a trail of their color until the grid edge.

    Args:
        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid representing pixel colors.

    Returns:
