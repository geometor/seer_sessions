"""
Transforms the input grid based on the locations of specific dynamic colors (Green=3, Magenta=6, Orange=7, Azure=8). 
For each location originally occupied by a dynamic color C_orig, a path is drawn starting from that location. 
The color P_new and direction D_new of the path are determined by a cyclic mapping:
- If C_orig was Green(3), the path is Azure(8) moving Top-Left (-1, -1).
- If C_orig was Magenta(6), the path is Green(3) moving Top-Right (-1, 1).
- If C_orig was Orange(7), the path is Magenta(6) moving Bottom-Right (1, 1).
- If C_orig was Azure(8), the path is Orange(7) moving Bottom-Left (1, -1).
The path starts at the original location C_orig and extends step-by-step in direction D_new. 
The path stops drawing just before it would step onto a cell that is outside the grid boundary or contains a non-white (non-zero) color in the *original input grid*. 
Static elements (like Red=2 blocks) remain in place unless overwritten by a path.
