            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because it misinterpreted the core transformation. While it correctly identified the dynamic colors (Green, Magenta, Orange, Azure) and their associated diagonal directions, it incorrectly assumed that each color pixel moved itself along that path from its *own* starting position and that the path extended to the grid edge unconditionally.\n\nThe comparison between the input, expected output, and the transformed output reveals a more complex interaction:\n\n1.  **Source->Path Mismatch:** The path of a certain color (e.g., Green) does *not* originate from the location of the Green pixel in the input. Instead, there's a cyclic relationship: Green paths start at original Magenta locations, Magenta paths at Orange locations, Orange paths at Azure locations, and Azure paths at Green locations.\n2.  **Path Starting Point:** The path starts *at* the source location (e.g., a Green path starts *at* the cell where a Magenta pixel was), not diagonally adjacent to it.\n3.  **Path Termination:** Paths do not always extend to the grid edge. They appear to stop just before hitting a non-white (non-zero) pixel *in the original input grid* or the grid boundary.\n4.  **Pixel Clearing:** The original locations of *all* dynamic pixels (Green, Magenta, Orange, Azure) are cleared (set to white/0) in the final output.\n\nThe strategy is to implement this new understanding: identify all dynamic pixel locations, clear them in an output grid, and then draw the paths according to the cyclic source->path mapping and the input-based collision detection rule.\n\n## Metrics and Evidence Gathering\n\nLet's confirm the cyclic mapping and termination rule using Example 2.\n\n"

            "text": "**Correction based on Tool Output:**\n\nThe tool output reveals crucial errors in my previous hypothesis:\n\n1.  **Path Termination Failure (Example 1):** My trace of the Magenta path from (3, 9) calculated `[(3, 9), (4, 10), (5, 11)]`. However, the expected output only has Magenta at (3, 9) and (4, 10). Why did it stop before (5, 11)? The *input* grid is 0 at (5, 11). This contradicts the hypothesis that paths stop *only* when the *next* step hits a non-zero input cell or boundary. Re-examining the expected output shows Magenta(6) at (3,9), (4,10), and also at (4,11) and (5,11). Wait, the path `[(3, 9), (4, 10), (5, 11)]` seems correct based on the *expected* output grid (which has 6 at all these locations). My previous look must have been mistaken. Let's re-run the code output check. The code output states `Actual output pixels along calculated path: [np.int64(6), np.int64(6), np.int64(6)]`. This means the expected output *does* have Magenta(6) at (3,9), (4,10), and (5,11). The path stopping rule (stop before non-zero *input* or boundary) seems correct for this path.\n2.  **Path Termination Failure (Example 2):** My trace of the Azure path from (7, 4) calculated `[(7, 4), (6, 3), (5, 2), (4, 1), (3, 0)]`. The expected output has Azure only at (7,4). Why did it stop? The input grid is 0 at (6, 3), (5, 2), (4, 1), (3, 0). The next step (2, -1) is out of bounds. The path should extend fully according to the rule. However, the code output check `Actual output pixels along calculated path: [np.int64(8), np.int64(7), np.int64(0), np.int64(0), np.int64(0)]` shows the expected output has Azure(8) only at (7,4) and Orange(7) at (6,3). This path *does not* match the expected output.\n3.  **Clearing Failure:** The check confirms that the original locations of dynamic pixels are *not* cleared in the final output. Instead, they are occupied by the *start* of the path that originates there.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:**\n\nThe cyclic mapping seems correct, but the clearing and path drawing need refinement.\n\n*   Maybe the path doesn't *overwrite* the starting cell?\n*   Let's re-examine Example 1 again.\n    *   Input: G@(2,2), M@(2,5), O@(5,5), A@(5,2)\n    *   Output: Green path @(2,5),(1,6),(0,7). Magenta path @(5,5),(6,6),(7,7),(8,8). Orange path @(5,2),(6,1),(7,0). Azure path @(2,2),(1,1),(0,0).\n    *   The cell (2,2) was Green, now it's Azure (start of Azure path).\n    *   The cell (2,5) was Magenta, now it's Green (start of Green path).\n    *   The cell (5,5) was Orange, now it's Magenta (start of Magenta path).\n    *   The cell (5,2) was Azure, now it's Orange (start of Orange path).\n\nOkay, the original locations are *overwritten* by the start of the path assigned to that location. No separate clearing step is needed if done carefully.\n\nWhat about the path stopping rule? Example 2, Azure path from Green Loc (7,4) TL (-1,-1). Input is 0 at (6,3), (5,2), (4,1), (3,0). Expected output only has Azure at (7,4). Why does it stop immediately?\nCould the path be blocked by *other paths* being drawn? This suggests an order of operations might matter, or perhaps paths stop if they hit *any* non-white cell in the *output* grid as it's being constructed, or even the *input* grid's static objects *plus* other dynamic objects?\n\nLet's test the \"stop if next step hits *any* non-zero in input\" rule more rigorously.\n*   Input Example 2: Azure Path (TL) from Green Loc (7,4).\n    *   Start (7,4). Input=3. Output should be 8.\n    *   Next step (-1,-1) is (6,3). Input=0. Continue.\n    *   Next step is (5,2). Input=0. Continue.\n    *   Next step is (4,1). Input=0. Continue.\n    *   Next step is (3,0). Input=0. Continue.\n    *   Next step is (2,-1). Out of bounds. Stop.\n    *   Path should be (7,4), (6,3), (5,2), (4,1), (3,0). Color Azure(8).\n    *   Expected output only has 8 at (7,4).\n\nThis rule is still insufficient. What if paths stop if they hit *any* non-zero cell OR *the location of another dynamic pixel* in the input grid?\n*   Input Example 2: Azure Path (TL) from Green Loc (7,4).\n    *   Start (7,4). Input=3 (dynamic). Output=8.\n    *   Next step (-1,-1) is (6,3). Input=0. Continue.\n    *   Next step is (5,2). Input=0. Continue.\n    *   Next step is (4,1). Input=0. Continue.\n    *   Next step is (3,0). Input=0. Continue.\n    *   Next step is (2,-1). Out of bounds. Stop.\n    *   Still predicts the wrong path length.\n\nLet's reconsider Example 1's paths and the input.\n*   Input: G(3)@(2,2), M(6)@(2,5), O(7)@(5,5), A(8)@(5,2). Red block (3,3)-(4,4).\n*   Azure Path (TL) from G@(2,2): Path (2,2), (1,1), (0,0). Stops at boundary. Input cells were 3, 0, 0. Matches output.\n*   Green Path (TR) from M@(2,5): Path (2,5), (1,6), (0,7). Stops at boundary. Input cells were 6, 0, 0. Matches output.\n*   Magenta Path (BR) from O@(5,5): Path (5,5), (6,6), (7,7), (8,8). Stops at boundary. Input cells were 7, 0, 0, 0. Matches output.\n*   Orange Path (BL) from A@(5,2): Path (5,2), (6,1), (7,0). Stops at boundary. Input cells were 8, 0, 0. Matches output.\n\nWhy did the Example 2, Azure Path (TL) from Green Loc (7,4) fail?\n*   Input: G@(7,4). Other dynamic: A@(7,1), G@(7,8), A@(7,11). Static: R@(8,2)-(9,3).\n*   Path starts (7,4). Input=3. Paint 8.\n*   Next step (6,3). Input=0. Paint 8.\n*   Next step (5,2). Input=0. Paint 8.\n*   Next step (4,1). Input=0. Paint 8.\n*   Next step (3,0). Input=0. Paint 8.\n*   Next step (2,-1). Out of bounds.\n*   Path should be 8s at (7,4), (6,3), (5,2), (4,1), (3,0).\n*   Expected output has 8 at (7,4), 7 at (6,3), 0 at (5,2), 0 at (4,1), 0 at (3,0).\n\nThere must be something else stopping the path. Could it be interference from other paths?\nWhere do paths overlap?\n*   Green path from M@(4,8) [TR]: (4,8),(3,9),(2,10),(1,11). Input=6,0,0,0. Expected=G,G,G,G. Looks ok.\n*   Magenta path from O@(3,9) [BR]: (3,9),(4,10),(5,11). Input=7,0,0. Expected=M,M,M. Looks ok.\n*   Orange path from A@(7,11) [BL]: (7,11),(8,10),(9,9),(10,8),(11,7). Input=8,0,0,0,0. Expected=O,O,O,O,O. Looks ok.\n*   Azure path from G@(7,8) [TL]: (7,8),(6,7),(5,6),(4,5),(3,4),(2,3),(1,2),(0,1). Input=3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Expected=A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A. Looks ok.\n\nLet's re-examine the specific failed path: Azure Path (TL) from G@(7,4).\n*   Input: G@(7,4). Static Red block at (8,2)-(9,3).\n*   Path: (7,4) -> (6,3) -> (5,2) -> (4,1) -> (3,0) -> boundary.\n*   The Red block is at (8,2), (8,3), (9,2), (9,3). Does the path interact? No.\n*   Is there an input dynamic pixel nearby? A@(7,1), O@(10,1). No direct interaction on the path cells.\n*   Consider the expected output grid state *during* the drawing process? Too complex.\n\nWhat if the stopping rule is: Stop if the next step hits a non-zero cell in the input *or* if the next step hits a cell *that is already occupied by another path being drawn*? This implies paths might block each other. Does the order matter? (3->8, 6->3, 7->6, 8->7)\n\nLet's assume an arbitrary order (Green paths, Magenta, Orange, Azure) and redraw Example 2 mentally with the \"block on non-zero input OR already drawn path\" rule.\n1.  Copy Input to Output.\n2.  **Draw Green Paths (from Magenta Locs)**\n    *   M@(0,9): G path (0,9). Stops boundary. Output[0,9]=3.\n    *   M@(4,8): G path (4,8),(3,9),(2,10),(1,11). Stops boundary. Output[4,8..]=3.\n    *   M@(10,4): G path (10,4),(9,5),(8,6). Stops boundary. Output[10,4..]=3.\n3.  **Draw Magenta Paths (from Orange Locs)**\n    *   O@(3,9): M path (3,9)? Already G(3). Blocked? No, rule is block on *next* step. Start (3,9). Output[3,9]=6. Next (4,10). Input=0. Output=0. Paint M(6). Next (5,11). Input=0. Output=0. Paint M(6). Next (6,12) boundary. Path: (3,9),(4,10),(5,11).\n    *   O@(4,11): M path (4,11). Output[4,11]=6. Next (5,12) boundary. Path: (4,11).\n    *   O@(10,1): M path (10,1),(11,2). Output[10,1..]=6. Next (12,3) boundary. Path: (10,1),(11,2).\n4.  **Draw Orange Paths (from Azure Locs)**\n    *   A@(0,6): O path (0,6) to (6,0). All input=0, output=0. Output[0,6..]=7.\n    *   A@(7,1): O path (7,1),(8,0). Output[7,1..]=7.\n    *   A@(7,11): O path (7,11) to (11,7). All input=0, output=0. Output[7,11..]=7.\n5.  **Draw Azure Paths (from Green Locs)**\n    *   G@(3,6): A path (3,6) to (0,3). All input=0, output=0. Output[3,6..]=8.\n    *   G@(7,4): A path (7,4). Output[7,4]=8. Next (6,3). Input=0. Output=0. Paint A(8). Next (5,2). Input=0. Output=0. Paint A(8). Next (4,1). Input=0. Output=0. Paint A(8). Next (3,0). Input=0. Output=0. Paint A(8). Next boundary. Path: (7,4) to (3,0).\n    *   G@(7,8): A path (7,8) to (0,1). All input=0, output=0. Output[7,8..]=8.\n\nThis still doesn't explain why the Azure path from G@(7,4) should only be one cell long in the expected output. The *only* non-zero input cells it could potentially hit are the Red block below it (8,2-3, 9,2-3) and the starting cells of other paths. None seem relevant based on the path coordinates.\n\nCould the color itself matter for stopping? Unlikely given ARC priors.\nIs the direction wrong? TL (-1,-1) seems consistent.\n\nLet's look *very* closely at the expected output for Example 2 near (7,4):\n`... 8 0 0 0 ...` (row 7)\n`... 0 0 0 8 ...` (row 8)\n`... 0 0 8 0 ...` (row 9)\n`... 0 8 0 0 ...` (row 10)\n`... 8 3 0 0 ...` (row 11)\n\nMy calculated Azure path (TL from G@(7,4)) was: (7,4), (6,3), (5,2), (4,1), (3,0).\nExpected output values: 8, 7, 0, 0, 0.\nThis indicates the path starting at (7,4) *is* Azure(8), but the very next step (6,3) is Orange(7). Where did that Orange come from?\nOrange paths start from Azure locations. A@(7,1) -> Path BL (1,-1): (7,1), (8,0). These are Orange(7).\nA@(0,6) -> Path BL (1,-1): (0,6)...(6,0). These are Orange(7).\nA@(7,11) -> Path BL (1,-1): (7,11)...(11,7). These are Orange(7).\nThe Orange(7) at (6,3) doesn't seem to come from any of these.\n\nWhat if the path stops if the *next* step location contains a non-zero value in the *expected output*? This is circular.\n\nCould the rule be simpler? Find the 4 dynamic pixels. Swap their locations cyclically (G->A, M->G, O->M, A->O). Draw the path from the *new* location using the color/direction of the pixel that *moved* there?\nExample 1:\nInput: G@(2,2), M@(2,5), O@(5,5), A@(5,2)\nCyclic swap: A moves to (2,2), G moves to (2,5), M moves to (5,5), O moves to (5,2).\nDraw paths from *new* locations:\n*   Azure (now @2,2), direction TL: Path starts (2,2) -> (1,1) -> (0,0). Color=Azure(8).\n*   Green (now @2,5), direction TR: Path starts (2,5) -> (1,6) -> (0,7). Color=Green(3).\n*   Magenta (now @5,5), direction BR: Path starts (5,5) -> (6,6) -> (7,7) -> (8,8). Color=Magenta(6).\n*   Orange (now @5,2), direction BL: Path starts (5,2) -> (6,1) -> (7,0).

Cyclic swap: A moves to (7,4).\nDraw path for Azure from new location (7,4), direction TL.\nPath starts (7,4). Paint A(8). Next (6,3). Input=0. Paint A(8). Next (5,2). Input=0. Paint A(8)... continues to boundary.\nThis *still* doesn't explain why the path stops after one step at (7,4) in the expected output.\n\nIs it possible the stopping rule involves the *color* being overwritten?\nMaybe path stops if the next step hits a non-zero value in the input *unless* that non-zero value is one of the 4 dynamic colors (which are being replaced anyway)?\nLet's re-test Azure path (TL) from G@(7,4) -> A swaps to (7,4).\nDraw path for A from (7,4) [TL]:\nStart (7,4). Paint A(8).\nNext (6,3). Input=0. Paint A(8).\nNext (5,2). Input=0. Paint A(8).\nNext (4,1). Input=0. Paint A(8).\nNext (3,0). Input=0. Paint A(8).\nBoundary. Stop.\nStill doesn't work.\n\nI must be misinterpreting the expected output or the mechanism fundamentally. Re-read task description/priors. Nothing obvious.\n\nCould the Red blocks interact in a way other than just blocking? No indication.\n\nWhat if the path length is fixed? No, lengths vary.\n\nLet's look at the specific cell (6,3) in Example 2. Input=0. Expected Output=7 (Orange).\nMy hypothesis puts Azure(8) there (as part of path from 7,4). Where does Orange(7) come from?\nOrange paths start at original Azure locations (0,6), (7,1), (7,11) and move BL (1,-1).\nPath from (0,6): (0,6)..(6,0) -> paints O(7)\nPath from (7,1): (7,1),(8,0) -> paints O(7)\nPath from (7,11): (7,11)..(11,7) -> paints O(7)\nNone of these paths hit (6,3).\n\nThis is confusing. The expected output at (6,3) is Orange(7). My best hypothesis (cyclic swap + path from new location) puts Azure(8) there. The previous hypothesis (path starts at cyclically next color's location) also puts Azure(8) there.\n\nMaybe the cyclic map is wrong?\nG(TR), M(BR), O(BL), A(TL)\nWhat maps to what?\nEx1: G@(2,2)->A path@(2,2). M@(2,5)->G path@(2,5). O@(5,5)->M path@(5,5). A@(5,2)->O path@(5,2).\nThis mapping seems solid based on Example 1.\n\nCould the stopping rule be: stop if next step hits non-zero in input OR hits the starting location of *another* path?\nLet's re-test Azure path (TL) from G@(7,4) -> A swaps to (7,4).\nDraw path for A from (7,4) [TL]:\nStart (7,4). Paint A(8).\nNext (6,3). Input=0. Is (6,3) a starting location for another path? No (starts are G,M,O,A locations). Paint A(8).\nNext (5,2). Input=0. Is (5,2) a starting location? No. Paint A(8).\n...still doesn't work.\n\nFinal attempt: What if the path stops if the *current* cell it's trying to paint is *already painted* by another path in the same step? Requires simultaneous drawing or careful ordering.\n\nLet's stick to the most promising hypothesis:\n1. Find locations of G, M, O, A.\n2. Create output grid copy.\n3. Determine target locations based on cycle: A goes to G's loc, G goes to M's loc, M goes to O's loc, O goes to A's loc.\n4. For each original dynamic pixel (color C, original location L_orig):\n    a. Find its target location L_target based on the cycle.\n    b. Determine path color P and direction (dr, dc) based on C (G->TR, M->BR, O->BL, A->TL).\n    c. Trace path starting at L_target:\n        i. Current cell = L_target.\n        ii. Loop:\n            - Paint current cell with color P in output grid.\n            - Calculate next cell = current cell + (dr, dc).\n            - Check stopping conditions for *next* cell:\n                - Out of bounds? Stop.\n                - Input grid at *next* cell is non-zero? Stop.\n            - Update current cell = next cell.\n\nThis seems the most consistent with Example 1. It fails Example 2's Azure path from (7,4). I'll proceed with this hypothesis but note the discrepancy.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
