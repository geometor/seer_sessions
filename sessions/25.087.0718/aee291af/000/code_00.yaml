# Focus on identifying objects, their properties, actions performed on them, and the relationships between them
Objects:
  - InputGrid: A 2D array of pixels (colors 1, 2, 8).
  - OutputGrid: A 2D array of pixels (colors 2, 8).
  - CandidateSubgrid: A square sub-section of the InputGrid.
  - Pixel: An element in a grid with a color value.

Properties:
  - CandidateSubgrid:
      - size: N x N (height equals width).
      - location: Top-left coordinates (row, column) within InputGrid.
      - border_pixels: The set of pixels forming the perimeter (top/bottom rows, first/last columns).
      - content_pixels: All pixels within the subgrid's boundaries.
  - Pixel:
      - color: Integer value (e.g., 1 for White, 2 for Red, 8 for Azure).

Relationships:
  - OutputGrid IS a CandidateSubgrid extracted from InputGrid.
  - A Qualifying CandidateSubgrid:
      - HAS border_pixels where color IS Azure(8) for all pixels.
      - HAS content_pixels where color IS ONLY Azure(8) or Red(2) for all pixels.
  - In each task example, all found Qualifying CandidateSubgrids ARE identical in size and pattern.

Actions:
  - SCAN InputGrid for all possible square CandidateSubgrids of varying sizes and locations.
  - FILTER CandidateSubgrids based on two criteria:
      1. Check if all border_pixels are Azure(8).
      2. Check if all content_pixels are only Azure(8) or Red(2).
  - IDENTIFY the unique pattern among the filtered (Qualifying) CandidateSubgrids.
  - OUTPUT the identified unique pattern as the OutputGrid.
