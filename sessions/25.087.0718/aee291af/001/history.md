Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Colors:** The input grids contain White (1), Azure (8), and Red (2) pixels. The output grids contain only Azure (8) and Red (2) pixels.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output is always a square grid (4x4 in the first two examples, 5x5 in the third).
3.  **Relationship:** The output grid appears to be a specific subgrid pattern extracted from the input grid.
4.  **Pattern Identification:** Let's examine where the output pattern occurs in the input.
    *   In `train_1`, the 4x4 output pattern `[[8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 2, 2, 8], [8, 8, 2, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8]]` is found starting at row 2, col 8, and also at row 9, col 8.
    *   In `train_2`, the 4x4 output pattern `[[8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 2, 8, 8], [8, 8, 2, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8]]` is found starting at row 10, col 7.
    *   In `train_3`, the 5x5 output pattern `[[8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 2, 8, 2, 8], [8, 8, 2, 8, 8], [8, 8, 2, 2, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]` is found starting at row 2, col 1, and also at row 9, col 5.
5.  **Pattern Characteristics:** The identified patterns (which become the output) share specific characteristics:
    *   They are square.
    *   Their border is composed entirely of Azure (8) pixels.
    *   They contain *only* Azure (8) and Red (2) pixels; crucially, they do not contain any White (1) pixels (or any other color besides 8 and 2).
6.  **Selection Rule:** The task seems to involve finding all square subgrids within the input that meet the criteria (Azure border, only Azure/Red content). In all provided examples, although a qualifying pattern might appear multiple times (`train_1`, `train_3`) or just once (`train_2`), all found qualifying patterns within a single input are *identical*. The transformation rule is therefore to find this unique qualifying pattern.

**Facts:**


```yaml
# Focus on identifying objects, their properties, actions performed on them, and the relationships between them
Objects:
  - InputGrid: A 2D array of pixels (colors 1, 2, 8).
  - OutputGrid: A 2D array of pixels (colors 2, 8).
  - CandidateSubgrid: A square sub-section of the InputGrid.
  - Pixel: An element in a grid with a color value.

Properties:
  - CandidateSubgrid:
      - size: N x N (height equals width).
      - location: Top-left coordinates (row, column) within InputGrid.
      - border_pixels: The set of pixels forming the perimeter (top/bottom rows, first/last columns).
      - content_pixels: All pixels within the subgrid's boundaries.
  - Pixel:
      - color: Integer value (e.g., 1 for White, 2 for Red, 8 for Azure).

Relationships:
  - OutputGrid IS a CandidateSubgrid extracted from InputGrid.
  - A Qualifying CandidateSubgrid:
      - HAS border_pixels where color IS Azure(8) for all pixels.
      - HAS content_pixels where color IS ONLY Azure(8) or Red(2) for all pixels.
  - In each task example, all found Qualifying CandidateSubgrids ARE identical in size and pattern.

Actions:
  - SCAN InputGrid for all possible square CandidateSubgrids of varying sizes and locations.
  - FILTER CandidateSubgrids based on two criteria:
      1. Check if all border_pixels are Azure(8).
      2. Check if all content_pixels are only Azure(8) or Red(2).
  - IDENTIFY the unique pattern among the filtered (Qualifying) CandidateSubgrids.
  - OUTPUT the identified unique pattern as the OutputGrid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty list to store qualifying patterns found.
2.  Iterate through all possible square sizes `s`, starting from 2 up to the smaller dimension (height or width) of the input grid.
3.  For each size `s`, iterate through all possible top-left starting positions `(row, col)` such that a square of size `s` fits entirely within the input grid boundaries.
4.  Extract the square subgrid of size `s` at `(row, col)`.
5.  Check if this subgrid meets the qualifying criteria:
    a.  Verify that every pixel on its border (the first and last row, and the first and last column of the subgrid) has the color Azure (8).
    b.  If the border condition is met, verify that every pixel *within* the subgrid (including the border) has a color that is either Azure (8) or Red (2). No other colors (like White (1)) should be present.
6.  If both criteria (a and b) are met, add this subgrid to the list of qualifying patterns.
7.  After checking all possible square subgrids, examine the list of qualifying patterns found.
8.  Since the examples suggest all qualifying patterns found within a single input grid will be identical, select the first pattern from the list (or any pattern, as they should all be the same).
9.  Return this selected pattern as the final output grid. If no qualifying patterns were found, the behavior is undefined by the examples, but likely implies returning an empty grid or handling an error (though this seems unlikely based on ARC task design).
