Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples involve grids with distinct regions:
    *   A border or frame region, primarily using azure (8).
    *   A 2x2 "key" block containing four distinct colors, located adjacent to the frame.
    *   A main "canvas" region, primarily white (0), containing scattered pixels of a single other color (the "source" color).
2.  **Key Block:** This 2x2 block seems crucial. Its location varies (top-left in Ex1, top-right in Ex2), and the specific colors within it change.
    *   Ex1 Key: `[[1, 4], [3, 2]]` (blue, yellow / green, red)
    *   Ex2 Key: `[[4, 6], [1, 2]]` (yellow, magenta / blue, red)
3.  **Canvas Area:** This is the main area where changes occur. It's predominantly white (0).
    *   Ex1 Canvas: Contains scattered blue (1) pixels.
    *   Ex2 Canvas: Contains scattered red (2) pixels.
4.  **Source Color:** The single non-white color scattered within the canvas area in the input. This color seems to be the target for transformation.
    *   Ex1 Source: Blue (1)
    *   Ex2 Source: Red (2)
    *   Notably, the source color in each example is also present *within* the corresponding 2x2 key for that example.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the source pixels within the canvas. The output color depends on the *position* of the source pixel within the canvas.
6.  **Positional Mapping:** The canvas area appears to be conceptually divided into four quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). The color assigned to a source pixel in the output corresponds to the color found in the matching position within the 2x2 key block.
    *   Pixel in canvas Top-Left quadrant -> Takes color from Key[0,0]
    *   Pixel in canvas Top-Right quadrant -> Takes color from Key[0,1]
    *   Pixel in canvas Bottom-Left quadrant -> Takes color from Key[1,0]
    *   Pixel in canvas Bottom-Right quadrant -> Takes color from Key[1,1]
7.  **Invariant Elements:** The frame (azure 8), the background (white 0) within the canvas, and the 2x2 key block itself remain unchanged between input and output.

```yaml
task_context:
  description: "Recolor pixels based on their quadrant within a defined canvas area, using a 2x2 color key."
  grid_elements:
    - element: Frame
      color: 8 (azure)
      role: Defines boundaries, remains unchanged.
    - element: Background
      color: 0 (white)
      role: Fills the main canvas area, remains unchanged.
    - element: Key
      shape: 2x2 block
      colors: Variable, non-background, non-frame.
      location: Adjacent to the frame (e.g., top-left, top-right).
      role: Provides the target colors for the transformation, remains unchanged. Contains 4 colors K_ul, K_ur, K_ll, K_lr corresponding to positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) within the key.
    - element: Canvas
      shape: Largest rectangular area primarily composed of Background color (0).
      contains: Background color (0) and scattered Source Color pixels.
      location: Bounded by Frame or grid edges.
      role: The area where the transformation occurs.
    - element: Source_Pixels
      color: Variable, single non-background color within the Canvas. Must be one of the colors present in the Key.
      role: The pixels that are targeted for recoloring.
  transformation:
    action: Recolor Source_Pixels within the Canvas.
    rule: "For each Source_Pixel:"
    condition: "Determine which quadrant of the Canvas the pixel resides in (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right)."
    outcome: "Change the pixel's color to the color from the corresponding position in the Key block (K_ul, K_ur, K_ll, K_lr)."
  invariants:
    - Frame pixels (color 8).
    - Background pixels (color 0) within the Canvas.
    - The 2x2 Key block itself.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify the Key:** Locate the 2x2 block of non-white (0), non-azure (8) colors. Store these four colors and their positions within the 2x2 block (Top-Left `K_ul`, Top-Right `K_ur`, Bottom-Left `K_ll`, Bottom-Right `K_lr`).
2.  **Identify the Canvas:** Find the largest rectangular region in the grid that is predominantly composed of white (0) pixels and is bordered by either azure (8) pixels or the grid edges. This region is the canvas. Determine its boundaries (top row, bottom row, left col, right col) and dimensions (height, width).
3.  **Identify the Source Color:** Within the identified canvas region, find the single color that is *not* white (0). This is the source color. (Verify this color exists within the Key identified in step 1).
4.  **Calculate Quadrant Boundaries:** Divide the canvas into four quadrants based on its dimensions. Calculate the midpoint row and column (integer division is likely appropriate).
    *   Top-Left Quadrant: Rows from canvas top to midpoint row, Columns from canvas left to midpoint column.
    *   Top-Right Quadrant: Rows from canvas top to midpoint row, Columns from midpoint column + 1 to canvas right.
    *   Bottom-Left Quadrant: Rows from midpoint row + 1 to canvas bottom, Columns from canvas left to midpoint column.
    *   Bottom-Right Quadrant: Rows from midpoint row + 1 to canvas bottom, Columns from midpoint column + 1 to canvas right.
5.  **Apply Transformation:** Create a copy of the input grid. Iterate through each pixel within the canvas boundaries of the copied grid.
    *   If the pixel's color in the *input* grid matches the source color:
        *   Determine which quadrant the pixel's coordinates fall into.
        *   Change the pixel's color in the *copied* grid to the color from the Key corresponding to that quadrant (`K_ul` for TL, `K_ur` for TR, `K_ll` for BL, `K_lr` for BR).
    *   If the pixel's color is not the source color, leave it unchanged in the copied grid.
6.  **Output:** The modified (copied) grid is the final output.
