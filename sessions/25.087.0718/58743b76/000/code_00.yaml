task_context:
  description: "Recolor pixels based on their quadrant within a defined canvas area, using a 2x2 color key."
  grid_elements:
    - element: Frame
      color: 8 (azure)
      role: Defines boundaries, remains unchanged.
    - element: Background
      color: 0 (white)
      role: Fills the main canvas area, remains unchanged.
    - element: Key
      shape: 2x2 block
      colors: Variable, non-background, non-frame.
      location: Adjacent to the frame (e.g., top-left, top-right).
      role: Provides the target colors for the transformation, remains unchanged. Contains 4 colors K_ul, K_ur, K_ll, K_lr corresponding to positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) within the key.
    - element: Canvas
      shape: Largest rectangular area primarily composed of Background color (0).
      contains: Background color (0) and scattered Source Color pixels.
      location: Bounded by Frame or grid edges.
      role: The area where the transformation occurs.
    - element: Source_Pixels
      color: Variable, single non-background color within the Canvas. Must be one of the colors present in the Key.
      role: The pixels that are targeted for recoloring.
  transformation:
    action: Recolor Source_Pixels within the Canvas.
    rule: "For each Source_Pixel:"
    condition: "Determine which quadrant of the Canvas the pixel resides in (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right)."
    outcome: "Change the pixel's color to the color from the corresponding position in the Key block (K_ul, K_ur, K_ll, K_lr)."
  invariants:
    - Frame pixels (color 8).
    - Background pixels (color 0) within the Canvas.
    - The 2x2 Key block itself.
