**General Assessment**

The provided code failed to correctly transform the input grids for both examples. The transformed output matched the input in the areas where changes were expected. This indicates a failure in the core logic responsible for identifying the elements required for the transformation (key, source color, target area) or in applying the changes.

Specifically, the previous logic relied heavily on identifying an "azure frame" to define the target area. While this worked conceptually for the first example used during initial code generation, it failed for Example 2 where the azure pixels form an adjacent block rather than a surrounding frame. The `find_target_area_by_frame` function returned `None` for Example 2, causing the transformation to be skipped.

The strategy for resolving these errors is to revise the method for identifying the "target area". Instead of relying on the azure pixels, the target area should be defined based on the spatial extent (bounding box) of the pixels that need to be recolored (the "source color" pixels).

**Facts**

task_description: Recolor pixels of a specific 'source' color within a 'target area' based on their quadrant, using colors defined by a 2x2 'key'.

definitions:
  - object: Key
    description: A 2x2 block of pixels where no color is white (0) or azure (8). It is unique in each grid.
    properties:
      - colors: A set of 4 colors defining the replacement palette. {TL, TR, BL, BR}.
      - location: Top-left coordinates (row, col).
  - object: Source Color Pixel
    description: A pixel whose color needs to be changed.
    properties:
      - color: The 'Source Color'. This color is unique and is characterized by being present both in the Key's colors and elsewhere in the grid (outside the Key, excluding white and azure).
      - location: Coordinates (row, col) outside the Key's 2x2 area.
  - object: Target Area
    description: The spatial region used to determine quadrants for recoloring.
    properties:
      - boundaries: Defined by the minimum and maximum row and column of all Source Color Pixels (outside the Key).
      - center: The conceptual dividing lines (horizontal and vertical) used for quadrant assignment. Calculated using integer division based on the boundaries.
        - mid_row_exclusive = min_row + height // 2
        - mid_col_exclusive = min_col + width // 2
  - object: Other Pixels
    description: Pixels that are not Source Color Pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Remains unchanged in the output grid. Includes white(0), azure(8), pixels within the Key, and any other pixels not matching the Source Color.

actions:
  - action: Find Key
    description: Locate the unique 2x2 block with no white or azure pixels. Extract its colors and location.
  - action: Identify Source Color
    description: Find the unique color present both in the Key colors and among the non-white, non-azure pixels outside the Key's location.
  - action: Define Target Area
    description: Determine the bounding box enclosing all Source Color Pixels found outside the Key.
  - action: Calculate Quadrant Boundaries
    description: Compute the row and column indices that divide the Target Area into four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).
  - action: Recolor Source Pixels
    description: For each Source Color Pixel (outside the Key), determine its quadrant within the Target Area and change its color to the corresponding color from the Key (TL, TR, BL, BR).

observations_from_failed_code:
  - observation: The initial assumption that the target area is defined by the inner region of an azure (8) frame is incorrect. Example 2 shows azure pixels adjacent to, not surrounding, the area of transformation.
  - verification: The `find_target_area_by_frame` function returned incorrect/invalid bounds for Example 2. The `find_source_color` function, dependent on these bounds, subsequently failed.
  - correction: The target area definition must be based on the distribution of the Source Color pixels themselves, specifically their bounding box.
  - verification: The revised logic (bounding box of source pixels outside key) correctly identifies the target area boundaries and quadrant splits matching the expected output for both examples. Example 1 target area (rows 2-9, cols 3-9), Example 2 target area (rows 2-11, cols 0-9). The quadrant split points also match the logic required to produce the correct output.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialize:** Create a copy of the input grid to store the output.
2.  **Find Key:** Scan the input grid to find the unique 2x2 block containing no white (0) or azure (8) pixels. Record the top-left (TL), top-right (TR), bottom-left (BL), and bottom-right (BR) colors of this Key, as well as its top-left coordinate (key_r, key_c). Store the set of unique colors present in the Key.
3.  **Identify Source Color:**
    a.  Create a list of coordinates and colors for all pixels in the input grid that are:
        i.  Not white (0).
        ii. Not azure (8).
        iii. Located *outside* the 2x2 area occupied by the Key (i.e., not where row is `key_r` or `key_r+1` AND col is `key_c` or `key_c+1`).
    b.  Find the unique color within this list that is also present in the set of Key colors identified in step 2. This is the "Source Color".
    c.  Record the coordinates of all pixels identified in step 3a that have the Source Color. These are the "Source Pixel Coordinates".
4.  **Define Target Area:** Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices from the Source Pixel Coordinates recorded in step 3c. These define the bounding box of the "Target Area" (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
5.  **Calculate Quadrant Boundaries:**
    a.  Calculate the height and width of the Target Area: `height = max_row - min_row + 1`, `width = max_col - min_col + 1`.
    b.  Calculate the row index that separates the top and bottom halves: `mid_row_exclusive = min_row + height // 2`.
    c.  Calculate the column index that separates the left and right halves: `mid_col_exclusive = min_col + width // 2`.
6.  **Apply Transformation:** Iterate through each coordinate (r, c) in the list of Source Pixel Coordinates (from step 3c).
    a.  Determine the quadrant for the coordinate (r, c) relative to the Target Area's boundaries:
        *   If `r < mid_row_exclusive` and `c < mid_col_exclusive`: Quadrant is Top-Left (TL). Use the Key's TL color.
        *   If `r < mid_row_exclusive` and `c >= mid_col_exclusive`: Quadrant is Top-Right (TR). Use the Key's TR color.
        *   If `r >= mid_row_exclusive` and `c < mid_col_exclusive`: Quadrant is Bottom-Left (BL). Use the Key's BL color.
        *   If `r >= mid_row_exclusive` and `c >= mid_col_exclusive`: Quadrant is Bottom-Right (BR). Use the Key's BR color.
    b.  Update the pixel at coordinate (r, c) in the copied output grid with the determined Key color.
7.  **Output:** Return the modified output grid.
