task_description: Recolor pixels of a specific 'source' color within a 'target area' based on their quadrant, using colors defined by a 2x2 'key'.

definitions:
  - object: Key
    description: A 2x2 block of pixels where no color is white (0) or azure (8). It is unique in each grid.
    properties:
      - colors: A set of 4 colors defining the replacement palette. {TL, TR, BL, BR}.
      - location: Top-left coordinates (row, col).
  - object: Source Color Pixel
    description: A pixel whose color needs to be changed.
    properties:
      - color: The 'Source Color'. This color is unique and is characterized by being present both in the Key's colors and elsewhere in the grid (outside the Key, excluding white and azure).
      - location: Coordinates (row, col) outside the Key's 2x2 area.
  - object: Target Area
    description: The spatial region used to determine quadrants for recoloring.
    properties:
      - boundaries: Defined by the minimum and maximum row and column of all Source Color Pixels (outside the Key).
      - center: The conceptual dividing lines (horizontal and vertical) used for quadrant assignment. Calculated using integer division based on the boundaries.
        - mid_row_exclusive = min_row + height // 2
        - mid_col_exclusive = min_col + width // 2
  - object: Other Pixels
    description: Pixels that are not Source Color Pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Remains unchanged in the output grid. Includes white(0), azure(8), pixels within the Key, and any other pixels not matching the Source Color.

actions:
  - action: Find Key
    description: Locate the unique 2x2 block with no white or azure pixels. Extract its colors and location.
  - action: Identify Source Color
    description: Find the unique color present both in the Key colors and among the non-white, non-azure pixels outside the Key's location.
  - action: Define Target Area
    description: Determine the bounding box enclosing all Source Color Pixels found outside the Key.
  - action: Calculate Quadrant Boundaries
    description: Compute the row and column indices that divide the Target Area into four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).
  - action: Recolor Source Pixels
    description: For each Source Color Pixel (outside the Key), determine its quadrant within the Target Area and change its color to the corresponding color from the Key (TL, TR, BL, BR).

observations_from_failed_code:
  - observation: The initial assumption that the target area is defined by the inner region of an azure (8) frame is incorrect. Example 2 shows azure pixels adjacent to, not surrounding, the area of transformation.
  - verification: The `find_target_area_by_frame` function returned incorrect/invalid bounds for Example 2. The `find_source_color` function, dependent on these bounds, subsequently failed.
  - correction: The target area definition must be based on the distribution of the Source Color pixels themselves, specifically their bounding box.
  - verification: The revised logic (bounding box of source pixels outside key) correctly identifies the target area boundaries and quadrant splits matching the expected output for both examples. Example 1 target area (rows 2-9, cols 3-9), Example 2 target area (rows 2-11, cols 0-9). The quadrant split points also match the logic required to produce the correct output.
