These colored blocks do not touch the outer white background directly; they are fully enclosed by the azure pixels.\n    *   The output grids are always 2x2.\n    *   The colors present in the output grid (excluding white) are the same colors as the rectangular blocks found inside the azure shape in the input grid.\n    *   The position of a color in the 2x2 output grid corresponds to the approximate quadrant (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) where the corresponding colored block is located within the bounding box of the main azure shape.\n    *   If a quadrant within the azure shape's bounding box does not contain a colored block, the corresponding cell in the output 2x2 grid is white (0).\n\n*   **facts**\n    "
