The rest of the grid is white (color 0).\n\n2.  **Action / Transformation Rule:** A blue (color 1) pixel appears to the right of the top pixel of each azure object.\n\n3. **Detailed Steps**\n    - Scan the input grid to find all instances of color 8 objects.\n    - For each 2x1 vertical group of color 8, determine the row and column index of its top-most cell.\n    - Create a 1x1 color 1 cell and place it to the direct right of each identified top cell. If the top cell is at column `c`, the new cell will be placed at column `c+1`.\n    - The position and shape of the color 8 objects remain unchanged.\n    - All other grid cells remain white(color 0)\n\n**Natural language program**\n```\nDEFINE the function \"transform\" which takes a 2D array \"input_grid\":\n    FOR each cell in the \"input_grid\" with color 8:\n        IF the cell below it has color 8:\n            place a color 1 cell at the position to the right of it.\n    Return modified grid\n```\n"
