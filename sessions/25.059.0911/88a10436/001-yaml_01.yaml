facts:
  - domain: 2D grid
  - elements: colored objects
  - object_property: color (represented by digits 0-9)
  - object_property: shape (contiguous block of same color)
  - object_property: position (grid coordinates)
  - transformation_type: spatial_rearrangement
  - transformation_detail: "copying and translation of a selected colored object to a location previously occupied by a single pixel object"
  - observation: "single pixel object of a unique color disappears after transform"
  - observation: "input is copied to output"
  - constraint: "transformation applied only to connected components that are not single pixels"
