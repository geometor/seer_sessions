There are distinct colored regions (objects) in the input grid: magenta (6), blue (1), red (2), and gray (5). The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid, focusing on the movement/replacement of certain colored regions. The single gray pixel in the input appears to be removed, or perhaps its relocation is not mirrored in the output by a corresponding non-zero pixel. The most prominent objects are horizontal lines of magenta, blue and red pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
