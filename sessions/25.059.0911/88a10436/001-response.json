The primary elements are colored objects, which appear to be contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color. There's a sense of spatial rearrangement, and possibly object interaction or copying. The input and output grids are not always the same size. Single colored pixels that do not form part of a larger object are ignored.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

It also finds a uniquely colored single pixel object, and moves a copy of the source object to that location in the output.\n"
