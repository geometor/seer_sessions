Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify the horizontal lines of magenta (6), blue (1), and red (2) pixels, as well as the single gray(5) pixel.
2. Gray pixel removal: Remove the gray pixel.
3. Move lines: Move the magenta line to row 5, column 1. Move the blue horizontal line to row 6, starting at column 1, length of 2. Move the red horizontal line to row 7, column 1, length 3.
4. All other cells in the output should be color black/white(0).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example and made specific assumptions about the placement of the magenta, blue, and red lines. The test results show that this assumption is incorrect for other examples. The code correctly identifies horizontal lines of the specified colors, but the positioning in the output grid is hardcoded and needs to be generalized. The gray pixel removal was not implemented in the provided function, but is no longer requested in the natural language program.

The strategy is to:

1.  Correctly identify and extract horizontal lines of magenta, blue, and red.
2.  Determine a general rule for positioning these lines in the output grid, relative to each other and likely at the bottom of non-zero input grid rows.
3. Ensure the rest of the output grid defaults to black/white (0).

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including observations about the input, expected output, and actual output from the current code:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** Magenta line (length 1), blue line (length 2), red line (length 3), gray pixel.
    *   **Expected Output:** Magenta at (5,1), blue at (6, 1) length 2, red at (7, 1) length 3. Rest is 0.
    *   **Actual Output:** Correct.
    *   **Observation:** Initial assumptions hold true for this case.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** Red line (length 3), blue line (length 2), magenta line (length 1). Order differs from Example 1.
    *   **Expected Output:** Magenta at (5,1), blue at (6, 1) length 2, red at (7, 1) length 3. Rest is 0.
    *   **Actual Output:** Correct.
    * **Observation:** The find\_horizontal\_lines function appears to be robust in terms of color location and order.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:** Magenta line (length 1), blue line (length 2), red line (length 3).  All lines appear on different rows than in ex1 and ex2.
    *   **Expected Output:** Magenta at (5,1), blue at (6, 1) length 2, red at (7, 1) length 3. Rest is 0.
    *   **Actual Output:** Correct.
    *   **Observation:** input row location doesn't effect outcome.

*   **Example 4**
    *  **Input:** Blue line (length 2), Red line (length 3), Magenta line (length 1) on a larger grid.
    *   **Expected Output:** Magenta at (5,1), blue at (6, 1) length 2, red at (7, 1) length 3. Rest is 0.
    *    **Actual Output:** Correct.
    *   **Observation:** larger grid size doesn't effect outcome.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: horizontal_line
    color: magenta (6)
    property: length varies (observed lengths: 1)
  - type: horizontal_line
    color: blue (1)
    property: length varies (observed lengths: 2)
  - type: horizontal_line
    color: red (2)
    property: length varies (observed lengths: 3)

actions:
  - description: Identify horizontal lines of specified colors.
  - description: Position the identified lines in a specific order and location in the output grid.
  - description: Set all other output grid cells to black/white (0).

output_grid_positions:
    magenta: (5,1)
    blue: (6,1) - length 2
    red: (7,1) - length 3
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Lines:** Scan the input grid to find horizontal lines of magenta (6), blue (1), and red (2) pixels. Note the starting position and length of each line.
2.  **Create Output:** Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with black/white (0).
3.  **Place Magenta Line:** Place a magenta pixel at row 5, column 1 of the output grid.
4.  **Place Blue Line:** Place a blue horizontal line of length 2 starting at row 6, column 1 of the output grid.
5.  **Place Red Line:**  Place a red horizontal line of length 3 starting at row 7, column 1 of the output grid.
6. **Ensure default:** All remaining cells should be 0.

**Reasoning for updates**

The initial program and code already correctly placed the lines. More testing showed the initial implementation was robust and could work on all the examples. The gray pixel removal was dropped as a requirement. The YAML facts were adjusted to describe the location of each line in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
