The blue pixels form vertical lines, and there are horizontal lines of blue pixels that cut through the grid.\n*   The output grid introduces two new colors: green (3) and yellow (4).\n*    The blue vertical and horizontal lines seem to be acting like barriers.\n*    The introduction of green seems to be filling the spaces defined by the blue and the yellow the spaces that are only enclosed by blue on 2 sides.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
