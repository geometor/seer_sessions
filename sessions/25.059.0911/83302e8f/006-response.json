            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, and as expected, it doesn't perfectly generalize to the other examples. The core idea of checking neighbors for azure pixels and changing white pixels based on their horizontal or vertical adjacency to azure is correct, but there are nuances and edge cases not yet addressed, and, based on Example 3's results, some fundamental errors.\n\nThe comparison reports highlight the discrepancies. The strategy to resolve these errors is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair and the comparison report to identify the specific rules that were missed or incorrectly applied.\n2.  **Refine Observations:** Update the YAML document with new observations or modified ones based on the comprehensive analysis.\n3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Modify the natural language program to incorporate the refined rules and edge cases, and ensure it includes handling for inputs like those in example 3, which did not change.\n4.  **Iterate:** This is the most important part. Propose new code based on these refinements.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example and the results:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 8)\n    *   Output Shape: (9, 8)\n    *   Result: Mostly correct. Only cells immediately adjacent (not diagonal) to an azure (8) cell and are white (0) change. Vertical adjacency changes to green (3), horizontal adjacency to yellow(4).\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 9)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 9)\n    *   Result: Mostly correct, see example 1 notes.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Output Shape: (6, 6)\n    *  Result: No change. This indicates an important condition that needs capturing. The previous examples had at least one white square in the input. This one doesn't. That may be the difference.\n\n**YAML Document (Observations)**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: 01a958d0\n  - objects:\n      - name: grid\n        description: A 2D array of pixels.\n        properties:\n          - rows: Variable\n          - cols: Variable\n          - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # All possible colors\n      - name: cell\n        description: An individual pixel within the grid.\n        properties:\n          - row: Row index of the cell.\n          - col: Column index of the cell.\n          - color: The color value of the cell (0-9).\n          - neighbors: List of adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, diagonals).\n  - transformations:\n      - condition: A cell is white (color 0) and has at least one azure (color 8) neighbor.\n        actions:\n          - if: Azure neighbor is directly above or below.\n            then: Change the cell's color to green (3).\n          - if: Azure neighbor is directly to the left or right.\n            then: Change the cell's color to yellow (4).\n          - if: no white squares in grid\n            then: no change\n      - condition: no white colors present in grid.\n        action:\n         - No change.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Examine the input grid:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid.\n2.  **Check for White Cells:** For each cell, check if its color is white (0).\n3. **Check for Azure Neighbors (only if the current cell is white):** If the cell is white, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).\n4.  **Conditional Color Change:**\n    *   If a neighbor directly above or below the white cell is azure (8), change the white cell's color to green (3).\n    *   If a neighbor directly to the left or right of the white cell is azure (8), change the white cell's color to yellow (4).\n5. **No white cells condition**: If no white cells are present in the input grid, return the original grid.\n\nThis revised natural language program now accounts for the key observation from Example 3: the transformation should produce no output change if the input contains no white.\n"
