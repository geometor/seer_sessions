Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Boundaries:** Locate all blue (1) pixels that form continuous horizontal and vertical lines. These lines serve as boundaries for the filling process.

2.  **Flood Fill with Green (3):** Starting from any black (0) pixel, change its color to green (3). Continue expanding this green region in all four directions (up, down, left, right) until a blue (1) pixel line or the edge of the grid is encountered. Repeat this for all disconnected black regions until no more black pixels can be filled with green.

3.  **Flood Fill with Yellow (4):** Starting from any remaining black (0) pixel, change its color to yellow (4). Continue expanding in all four directions until any of the following is encountered:
    *   A blue (1) pixel.
    *   A green (3) pixel.
    *   Two edges of the grid (e.g. a corner or a black region adjacent to two non-connected edges)

4. Repeat step 3 until there are no more black pixels.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were based on observations from the first training example. While it worked for the first example, it failed on the second and third. The primary issue seems to be the oversimplified condition for the yellow fill. The original logic assumed that yellow fills only regions touching two edges *or* encountering a boundary color. However, the second training example highlights areas filled with yellow that only contact one edge and also areas that contact two edges and are next to existing yellow color and shouldn't be filled. The third example shows that yellow must also fill when adjacent on multiple sides and a boundary, so the yellow fill logic needs significant refinement.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, paying close attention to the conditions under which black pixels are filled with green or yellow.
2.  **Refine Boundary Conditions:** The core of the problem is accurately defining the boundary conditions for the yellow fill. We need to identify scenarios where yellow fill *should* and *should not* occur. Proximity to edges, existing green/blue/yellow pixels, and the number of adjacent boundary pixels will all be crucial.
3. **Update Natural Language Program:** revise the natural language to improve the yellow fill description.
4.  **Iterative Code Adjustment:** Based on the refined natural language program, update the Python code, specifically the `flood_fill_yellow` function, to reflect the corrected logic. Test thoroughly after each adjustment.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To understand the transformations precisely, let's collect some information. I will manually inspect these for now since the primary issue is with the conceptual understanding, but I would build tools for automated analysis in the future.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with a blue horizontal line in the middle. Black above and below.
    *   Output: Green above the blue line, yellow below.
    *   Result: Success.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5 grid. Blue vertical line and partial horizontal line.
    *    Output: Green and yellow fill separated by the blue line, and in one case by an existing yellow square.
    *   Result: Failure. Some black pixels incorrectly remain black. Others incorrectly turn yellow.
*   **Example 3:**
    *  Input: complex shape of blue.
    *   Output: green and yellow filling.
    *   Result: Failure. Some black pixels remain, others are incorrectly filled.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
example_1:
  input:
    objects:
      - type: horizontal_line
        color: blue
        length: 3
      - type: region
        color: black
        location: above_line
      - type: region
        color: black
        location: below_line
  output:
    objects:
       - type: region
         color: green
         location: above_line
       - type: region
         color: yellow
         location: below_line
  transformation:
    - fill_region(above_line, green)
    - fill_region(below_line, yellow)

example_2:
  input:
    objects:
      - type: vertical_line
        color: blue
        length: 5
      - type: horizontal_line_segment
        color: blue
        length: 2
      - type: region
        color: black
  output:
     objects:
      - type: region
        color: green
      - type: region
        color: yellow
  transformation:
      - fill_region_with_green_until_blue
      - fill_remaining_black_with_yellow_avoiding_green_and_blue_unless_multiple_adjacent

example_3:
  input:
    objects:
      - type: complex_shape
        color: blue
      - type: region
        color: black
  output:
    objects:
       - type: region
         color: green
       - type: region
         color: yellow
  transformation:
      - fill_region_with_green_until_blue
      - fill_remaining_black_with_yellow_avoiding_green_and_blue_unless_multiple_adjacent

```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Boundaries:** Locate all blue (1) pixels. These form the boundaries.

2.  **Flood Fill with Green (3):** Starting from any black (0) pixel, change its color to green (3). Continue expanding this green region in all four directions (up, down, left, right) until a blue (1) pixel or the edge of the grid is encountered. Repeat this for all disconnected black regions until no more black pixels can be filled with green.

3.  **Flood Fill with Yellow (4):** Starting from any remaining black (0) pixel, change its color to yellow (4).  Continue expanding in all four directions until any of the following is encountered:

    *   A blue (1) pixel.
    *   A green (3) pixel.
    *   A yellow (4) pixel that is also connected to a boundary (either an edge or another boundary color - 1 or 3)
    *   If the current black pixel is completely surrounded by boundary pixels, it should be converted to yellow, regardless of the number of unique boundary pixels.

4.  Repeat step 3 until there are no more black pixels.

The key change is in step 3. It is no longer about being adjacent to two edges, it is being closed off by a boundary, regardless if that boundary consists of one, two, or three edge segments, or existing boundary pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
