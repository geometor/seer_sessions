Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example pair, aiming to discern the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains primarily white (0) and azure (8) pixels, while the output grid introduces green (3) and yellow (4) pixels, altering the arrangement and colors. The azure (8) pixels appear to form a connected shape in both the input and output, and the white pixels become green or yellow based on their relationship to the azure.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: azure_shape
    type: connected_shape
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - diagonal_lines

  - id: white_background
    type: background
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - fills_space
      - changes_color

  - id: green_fill
    type: fill
    color: green (3)
    properties:
     - replaces_white
     - above/below_azure

  - id: yellow_fill
      type: fill
      color: yellow (4)
      properties:
        - replaces_white
        - left/right_of_azure

actions:
  - type: color_change
    target: white_background
    condition:
      - adjacent_to: azure_shape
    result:
      - green_fill : if above/below
      - yellow_fill: if left/right

relationships:
  - azure_shape: surrounds: white_background
  - green_fill: adjacent: azure_shape, vertical
  - yellow_fill: adjacent: azure_shape, horizontal
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Azure Shape:** Locate the connected shape formed by azure (8) pixels. This shape consists of diagonal lines.

2.  **Analyze White Pixel Adjacency:** Examine the white (0) pixels adjacent to the azure shape.

3.  **Conditional Color Change:**
    *   If a white pixel is directly above or below an azure pixel, change its color to green (3).
    *   If a white pixel is directly to the left or right of an azure pixel, change its color to yellow (4).
    * If a white pixel is diagonally adjacent, leave it unchanged.

4.  The azure shape's color is preserved, so no changes happen to its colors.
