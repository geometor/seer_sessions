            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code were based on observations from the first training example. It seems the concept of \"flood fill\" with different colors based on proximity to blue lines was a good starting point. However, the provided code and description has errors that must be addressed. The primary issue seems to be the handling of yellow and understanding multiple connected components of the same color. The current approach has limitations when multiple separated regions of black exist, especially near corners or multiple blue lines.\n\nThe strategy to address these issues will involve:\n\n1.  **Precise Boundary Definition:** Clearly define the boundaries for both green and yellow fills. The current description is ambiguous, especially for yellow.\n2.  **Connected Component Analysis:** Consider the possibility of needing to identify and process separate regions (connected components) of black pixels independently.\n3.  **Refined Flood Fill:** Ensure the flood fill algorithm correctly handles boundaries and does not \"leak\" into unintended areas.\n4.  **Iterative Testing:** Test the revised code and natural language program against *all* training examples after each modification, not just the first one.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of what happened with the provided code on the other training examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Works perfectly as per the initial rule and code\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   The output is not correct.\n\n    ```\n    Input:\n    [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n\n    Expected Output:\n    [[3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 1 1 1 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 1 0 1 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 1 1 1 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3]]\n\n    Actual Output:\n    [[3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 1 1 1 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 1 4 1 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 1 1 1 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3]]\n    ```\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   The output is not correct\n\n    ```\n    Input:\n    [[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 1 1 1 1 0]\n     [0 1 0 0 1 0]\n     [0 1 0 0 1 0]\n     [0 1 1 1 1 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n\n    Expected Output:\n    [[3 3 3 3 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 3 3 3]\n     [3 1 1 1 1 3]\n     [3 1 4 4 1 3]\n     [3 1 4 4 1 3]\n     [3 1 1 1 1 3]\n     [3 3 3 3 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 3 3 3]]\n\n    Actual Output:\n    [[3 3 3 3 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 3 3 3]\n     [3 1 1 1 1 3]\n     [3 1 4 4 1 3]\n     [3 1 4 4 1 3]\n     [3 1 1 1 1 3]\n     [3 3 3 3 3 3]\n     [3 3 3 3 3 3]]\n    ```\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: grid\n    type: 2D array\n    description: Contains pixels of different colors.\n  - name: blue_lines\n    type: line segments\n    description: Horizontal and vertical lines formed by contiguous blue (1) pixels.

These lines serve as boundaries for the filling process.\n\n2.  **Flood Fill with Green (3):** Starting from any black (0) pixel, change its color to green (3). Continue expanding this green region in all four directions (up, down, left, right) until a blue (1) pixel line or the edge of the grid is encountered. Repeat this for all disconnected black regions until no more black pixels can be filled with green.\n\n3.  **Flood Fill with Yellow (4):** Starting from any remaining black (0) pixel, change its color to yellow (4). Continue expanding in all four directions until any of the following is encountered:\n    *   A blue (1) pixel.\n    *   A green (3) pixel.\n    *   Two edges of the grid (e.g. a corner or a black region adjacent to two non-connected edges)\n\n4. Repeat step 3 until there are no more black pixels.\n"
