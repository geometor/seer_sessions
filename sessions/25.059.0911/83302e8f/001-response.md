Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (matrices) where each cell contains a single digit representing a color. The input grids appear to have a pattern of lines forming a shape, predominantly using one color, against a background of another color. The output grids seem to modify the colors within the shape, sometimes introducing new colors, and inverting the colors in specific crossing. The overall shape defined by the non-background pixels appears to be mostly preserved, with changes primarily focused on color assignments. There appear to be different "layers" of crossing, using different colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      properties:
        - width: number of columns
        - height: number of rows
  - shape:
      type: connected component
      elements: contiguous pixels of the same non-background color
      properties:
        - color: initial color of the shape
        - outline: set of pixels forming the shape boundary
        - interior: set of pixels inside the shape boundary
  - background:
      type: connected component
      elements: pixels not belonging to the primary shape, usually color 0
      properties:
       - color: background color (usually 0)

actions:
  - color_inversion:
      description:  inverts pixel colors in crossing areas and adjacent areas.
      parameters:
        - affected_area: locations where the colors will be inverted.
  - color_fill:
     description: Fill background areas of the primary shape based on the crossing.
     parameters:
       - new_color: replacement colors based on original color of the primary shape.

relationships:
  - spatial:
    - adjacency: pixels directly next to each other (horizontally or vertically)
    - containment: pixels within the boundary of the primary shape
    - intersection: pixels where parts of the shape cross

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the primary shape:** Find the connected component of non-background color pixels (where the background is typically color 0).
2.  **Identify crossing:** identify areas where vertical and horizontal lines cross.
3.  **Color Inversion:** based on crossings, apply color inversion to crossing areas and adjacent area.
4.  **Background fill:** Based on the crossing, change areas to predefined colors.

In summary, the main transformation seems to be creating crossings with inverted colors and filling sections.
