Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Azure Shape:** Locate the connected shape formed by azure (8) pixels. This shape consists of diagonal lines.

2.  **Analyze White Pixel Adjacency:** Examine the white (0) pixels adjacent to the azure shape.

3.  **Conditional Color Change:**
    *   If a white pixel is directly above or below an azure pixel, change its color to green (3).
    *   If a white pixel is directly to the left or right of an azure pixel, change its color to yellow (4).
    * If a white pixel is diagonally adjacent, leave it unchanged.

4.  The azure shape's color is preserved, so no changes happen to its colors.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
