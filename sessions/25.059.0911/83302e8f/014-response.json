These form the boundaries.\n\n2.  **Flood Fill with Green (3):** Starting from any black (0) pixel, change its color to green (3). Continue expanding this green region in all four directions (up, down, left, right) until a blue (1) pixel or the edge of the grid is encountered. Repeat this for all disconnected black regions until no more black pixels can be filled with green.\n\n3.  **Flood Fill with Yellow (4):** Starting from any remaining black (0) pixel, change its color to yellow (4).  Continue expanding in all four directions until any of the following is encountered:\n\n    *   A blue (1) pixel.\n    *   A green (3) pixel.\n    *   A yellow (4) pixel that is also connected to a boundary (either an edge or another boundary color - 1 or 3)\n    *   If the current black pixel is completely surrounded by boundary pixels, it should be converted to yellow, regardless of the number of unique boundary pixels.\n\n4.
