Continue expanding this green region in all four directions (up, down, left, right) until a blue (1) pixel line or the edge of the grid is encountered. Repeat this for all disconnected black regions until no more black pixels can be filled with green.\n\n3.  **Flood Fill with Yellow (4):** Starting from any remaining black (0) pixel, change its color to yellow (4). Continue expanding in all four directions until any of the following is encountered:\n    *   A blue (1) pixel.\n    *   A green (3) pixel.\n    *   Two edges of the grid (e.g. a corner or a black region adjacent to two non-connected edges)\n\n4.
