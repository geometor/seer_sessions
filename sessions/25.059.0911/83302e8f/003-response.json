The input grid contains primarily white (0) and azure (8) pixels, while the output grid introduces green (3) and yellow (4) pixels, altering the arrangement and colors. The azure (8) pixels appear to form a connected shape in both the input and output, and the white pixels become green or yellow based on their relationship to the azure.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
