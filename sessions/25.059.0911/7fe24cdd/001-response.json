The colors are represented by single-digit integers (0-9). The transformation appears to involve some form of pattern replication or expansion, not just a simple scaling. The relationship between the input and output grids isn't a direct 1:4 pixel expansion, as the arrangement of colors changes. It seems more sophisticated.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts**\n\n"
