Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program consists of three different transformation rules, applied based on the characteristics of the input grid.

1.  **Rule 1 (Examples 1 & 2): 2x2 Tiling with Reflections**
    *   The input grid is expanded to double its original dimensions (2x2 tiling).
    *   The original input grid occupies the top-left quadrant of the output grid.
    *   The top-right quadrant is a vertically reflected image of the top-left quadrant.
    *   The bottom-left quadrant is a horizontally reflected image of the top-left quadrant.
    *   The bottom-right quadrant is both a horizontally and vertically reflected image of the top-left (180-degree rotation).

2.  **Rule 2 (Example 3): Horizontal Expansion with Alternating Columns**
    *   The output grid's width is double the input grid's width. The height remains the same.
    *   The output grid consists of alternating columns from the input grid.
    * Specifically the output pattern, using the input columns as `i0`, `i1` and `i2` is `i1`, `i0`, `i1`, `i0`, `i1`, `i0`

3.  **Rule 3 (Example 4): Identity Transformation**
    *   The output grid is identical to the input grid. No changes are made.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
