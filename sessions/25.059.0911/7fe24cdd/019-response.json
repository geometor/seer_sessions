The input grid appears to be smaller (3x3) than the output grid (6x6). The colors present are white (0), green (3), and magenta (6). The output grid seems to be a \"mirrored\" or \"expanded\" version of the input, with the colors alternating in a checkerboard-like pattern. The mirroring seems to be both horizontal and vertical. The black borders might need to be ignored and treated as an artifact.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This creates a new, empty grid four times the size of the original.\n\n2. **Mirroring and Filling:**  Iterate through the cells of the *original* input grid. For each cell:\n    - Place the original cell's color in the corresponding position in the expanded grid, then fill it in a 2x2 block of the same value.  This creates the size doubling effect.\n    - Or, looking at the output grid:\n        *   Copy the original value to the `[row][col]` location.\n        *   Copy the original value to the `[row][col + original_width]` location.\n        *   Copy the original value to the `[row + original_height][col]` location.\n        *   Copy the original value to the `[row + original_height][col+ original_width]`\n            location.\n\n3. **Result:** The expanded grid is now filled, with the colors from the original grid mirrored and repeated to create the checkerboard type design.\n"
