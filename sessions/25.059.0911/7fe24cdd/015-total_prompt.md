Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is expanded to double its original dimensions. The 3x3 input becomes a 6x6 output.

The original 3x3 input grid occupies the top-left quadrant of the 6x6 output grid.
The top-right quadrant of the output is a vertically reflected image of the top-left quadrant.
The bottom-left quadrant of the output is a horizontally reflected image of the top-left quadrant.
The bottom-right quadrant is both a horizontally and vertically reflected image of the top-left, which is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
