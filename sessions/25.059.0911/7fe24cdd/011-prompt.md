Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves a two-step expansion of the input 3x3 grid.

1.  **Horizontal Expansion:** Each pixel in the input grid is duplicated horizontally. For example, if a pixel has the value '5', it becomes two adjacent pixels with the value '5, 5'. This transforms the 3x3 grid into a 3x6 grid.

2.  **Vertical Expansion:** Each row in the resulting 3x6 grid from step 1 is duplicated. This means each row is repeated immediately below itself. This transforms the 3x6 grid into a 6x6 grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize an intermediate 3x6 grid for horizontal expansion.
    intermediate_grid = np.zeros((3, 6), dtype=int)

    # Horizontal expansion: Duplicate each pixel horizontally.
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            intermediate_grid[i, 2*j] = input_grid[i, j]
            intermediate_grid[i, 2*j + 1] = input_grid[i, j]

    # Initialize the final 6x6 output grid.
    output_grid = np.zeros((6, 6), dtype=int)

    # Vertical expansion: Duplicate each row from the intermediate grid.
    for i in range(3):
        output_grid[2*i, :] = intermediate_grid[i, :]
        output_grid[2*i + 1, :] = intermediate_grid[i, :]

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
