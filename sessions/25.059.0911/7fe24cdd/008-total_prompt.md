**input:**

**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (6x6). The input grid appears to be composed of single-digit integers, each representing a different color. The output grid seems to be an expanded version of the input, with some kind of pattern or rule governing the expansion. The black borders seem important to how the shapes are constructed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task: grid_transformation
input:
  type: 2D_grid
  dimensions: 3x3
  elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
output:
  type: 2D_grid
  dimensions: 6x6
  elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  relationship_to_input: expanded and patterned
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - element_type: integer
  - name: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 6x6
      - element_type: integer
actions:
  - type: expansion
    description: The input grid is expanded into the output grid.
  - type: pattern_replication
    description: A pattern, potentially based on mirroring and/or repeating, is applied during expansion.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a new 6x6 output grid.
2.  **Expansion:** For each cell in the 3x3 input grid, generate a 2x2 block of cells in the output grid.
3.  **Value Assignment:** Fill each block of 4 output cells with the corresponding color from the input cell.
4. Iterate the input row by row. First copy the 3 input pixels to make row 1 of the output.
5. Copy row 1 as row 2 of the output.
6. Move to the next input row.
7. Copy input row 2 to rows 3 and 4 of the output.
8. Repeat step 7 for the final row of the input to produce output rows 5 and 6.

Essentially, each pixel from the input grid becomes a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid in two steps, first expand to the right to double the columns, then expand down by copying the expanded row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
