"""
The transformation involves inverting the colors of the input grid based on a specific rule, and also inverting the grid diagonally. The rule seems to be: if a pixel's color in the input grid is black (0), it becomes blue (1) in the output grid. If a pixel's color is blue (1), it becomes black (0) in the output grid. Other colors remain unchanged. The grid itself is also flipped diagonally.
