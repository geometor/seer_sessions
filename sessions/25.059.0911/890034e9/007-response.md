Okay, I'm ready to analyze this example pair and try to understand the transformation. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid:** The input and output are both 21x21 grids.
*   **Colors:** The grids use colors 0 (white), 3 (green), 4 (yellow), and 8 (azure).
*   **Shapes:** There are irregular shapes formed by contiguous blocks of the same color.
*   **Specific Change:** The most obvious change is a block of azure (8) in the input, that gets segmented or parts are replaced by other colours in a specific pattern, in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 21x21
      colors: [0, 3, 4, 8]
  - type: region
    properties:
      colors: [0, 3, 4, 8]
      shape: irregular
      contiguous: true
actions:
  - type: replace
    properties:
      target_color: 8
      replacement_pattern: specific locations based on relative positions
relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: Colors form contiguous regions.
      properties:
          adjacent: true

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of color 8 (azure) within the input grid.
2.  **Targeted Replacement:** within each azure region
    *   If the azure region spans 5 consecutive horizontal cells, keep it, and move to next azure region.
    *   If azure region is less than 5 consecutive horizontal cells, keep azure.
    *   If the azure region is more than 5 horizontal cells, analyze as follows:
        1.  Replace the first and last two 8s with colour of cell directly above. If there is no cell directly above (at edge of grid) maintain 8.
        2.  Within the now shortened azure region (with 2 cells at start/end removed) replace with colour directly above. If there is no cell directly above, maintain 8.

Essentially, the transformation selectively replaces parts of the azure (8) regions based on their horizontal extension and position of other colours in the column above.
