examples:
  - example_1:
      status: correct
      input_objects:
        - color: green
          shape: single pixel
          neighbors:
            yellow: 3
      output_objects:
        - color: yellow
          shape: single pixel
      transformation: color change (green to yellow)
      notes: Initial rule seems valid here.

  - example_2:
      status: incorrect
      input_objects:
          - color: yellow
            shape: 2x1, 1x1
            position: top-left
          - color: green
            shape: 1x1
            position: top-right
          - color: blue
            shape: 1x2
            position: bottom-right
      output_objects:
          - color: yellow
            shape: 2x1, 1x1
            position: bottom-right
          - color: green
            shape: 1x1
            position: bottom-left
          - color: blue
            shape: 1x2
            position: top-left
      transformation: shift of all object positions.
      notes:  The initial rule does not apply, the output shift the objects into diagonally opposite positions.

  - example_3:
      status: incorrect
      input_objects:
          - color: yellow
            shape: 2x1, 1x1
            position: bottom-right
          - color: green
            shape: 1x1
            position: bottom-left
          - color: blue
            shape: 1x2
            position: top-left
      output_objects:
           - color: yellow
             shape: 2x1, 1x1
             position: top-left
           - color: green
             shape: 1x1
             position: top-right
           - color: blue
             shape: 1x2
             position: bottom-right
      transformation: shift of all object positions.
      notes: The initial rule is invalid. The objects are shifted to diagonally opposite positions.
