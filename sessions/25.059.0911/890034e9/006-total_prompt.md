Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were focused on identifying red squares and changing white pixels within their interiors to red. This approach works for some cases but fails to generalize to all the training examples. The primary issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Square Identification:** The `find_squares` function doesn't correctly identify all valid red squares, particularly those adjacent to other red pixels that are part of other squares. It can also get tripped up when the red "squares" have irregular borders.
2.  **Oversimplified Interior Logic:** The assumption that only white pixels inside red squares should be changed to red is too restrictive. The examples show more complex rules.
3.  **1x1 red pixel special condition not understood**: the behavior of the code when there are 1x1 red cells is incorrect - it should preserve them as 1x1.

The strategy to address these issues is to:

1.  **Improve Shape Detection:** Refine how squares are identified and handled. We may need to check if there is an internal matrix of identical pixels in all circumstances.
2.  **Re-evaluate Transformation Rules:** Carefully analyze the input/output pairs to discern the *precise* conditions under which pixel colors change. There might be more general rules based on surrounding pixels, not just the "interior" of squares.
3. **Document better**: include more information for the coder to understand how to implement a solution

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To accurately understand the transformations, let's examine each example pair. Because the code doesn't produce perfect output, I will describe the *expected* transformation, not what the current code produces. I cannot "execute" code, so the descriptions are based on visual inspection of the provided images.

*   **Example 1:** Input has one 3x3 red square with a white center. Output changes the center to red. (Current code works correctly)

*   **Example 2:** Input has one 3x3 red square and a single red pixel. Output changes nothing. (Current code works correctly)

*   **Example 3:** Input has one 5x5 red square with many white pixels in its interior and a 3x3 square of red pixels. Output changes all white pixels inside the 5x5 square to red. (Current code fails - it fills only partially.)

*    **Example 4:** Input is all white with a single red 1x1. The output is identical. (Current code works correctly)

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: red_region
    description: Regions of connected red pixels.  These can be any size or dimensions, not necessarily square.
    properties:
      - shape: variable
        notes: Can be square, rectangular, or irregular.
      - color: red (2)
      - interior: The pixels surrounded entirely by the red region.
        interior_colors:
          contains_white:
            exists: boolean #if there are any white cells in the interior
            action: fill #fill with red if true

  - object: 1x1_red_pixel
    description: Single red pixels not part of a larger red region.
    properties:
      - size: 1x1
      - color: red (2)
    actions:
      - preserve:  # These pixels remain unchanged.

actions:
  - name: fill_interior
    target: red_region
    condition: interior.contains_white.exists == True
    transformation: Change all interior pixels to red (2).
  - name: no_change
    target: 1x1_red_pixel
    condition: Always
    transformation: retain the 1x1 red pixel

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Red Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of red (2) pixels. These regions can be of any shape (not just squares).

2.  **Analyze Interior of Red Regions:** For each identified red region, examine its interior pixels (those completely surrounded by red pixels).
3.  **Check Interior Colors:** If the interior contains any white (0) pixels, fill all of the red region's interior pixels to red (2).

4. **Preserve 1x1 Red Pixels:** Leave any isolated 1x1 red (2) pixels unchanged.

5.  **Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the input grid that are *not* part of the interior of a red region remain unchanged in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
