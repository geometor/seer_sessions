Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on observations from the first training example. While it correctly handles the first example, the subsequent tests reveal that the logic is incomplete. Specifically, the initial program doesn't fully capture the intricacies of how azure regions are modified based on their length and the colors above them. The core issue is in the strict condition of `horizontal_span > 5` and replacement logic being applied only when the span is *greater* than 5, and not when equal. It also doesn't account for cases where sections less than 5 are in horizontal alignment with sections greater than 5, and are therefore impacted. The assumption of 5 as being somehow key also needs to be reviewed.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** The primary assumption that a horizontal span of *exactly* 5 is a special case needs revisiting. The provided examples suggest the rule applies to spans of 5 *or more*.
2.  **Comprehensive Region Analysis:** Instead of only looking at each azure region in isolation, consider their relationship with vertically adjacent pixels.
3. **Horizontal Alignment:** Check not just the horizontal span of individual azure sections, but check if sections of less than 5 are horizontally adjacent to larger sections that meet the "replace" criteria.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated natural language program and code against *all* training examples after each modification.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary):**

```

**Example Analysis:**

*   **Example 1:** Grids match. (Baseline - simple case)
*   **Example 2:** Grids do *not* match. The code didn't replace azure pixels in the second row where the horizontal span was >= 5.
*   **Example 3:** Grids do *not* match. The code didn't apply the transformation where a region of 3 azure pixels is adjacent (horizontally in-line) with a region of 7, so the whole span becomes length 10, triggering the replacement.
*  **Example 4:** Grids do not match, multiple rows and regions of length > 5 AND a region with horizontal alignment.

```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of color 8 (azure) within the input grid.

2.  **Horizontal Span Calculation:** For each azure region, and for regions that are horizontally adjacent, calculate the combined horizontal span.

3. **Conditional Replacement:** For any combined azure region:

    *   If the horizontal span is less than 5, no replacement occurs.
    *   If the horizontal span is 5 or greater, examine each pixel:

        1.  Check for a pixel directly above.
        2.  If a pixel exists directly above, replace the azure pixel with the color of the pixel above.
        3.  If there's no pixel directly above, retain the original azure color (8).

4. For other colours, no action.

This revised program accounts for the combined horizontal spans and applies the replacement rule based on the presence of pixels above, handling edge cases correctly. It generalizes the rule observed in all training examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
