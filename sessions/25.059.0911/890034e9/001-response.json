The colors are represented by single digits (0-9). There are clear, consistent changes between the input and output grids. The changes appear to be localized and related to specific colors or shapes, with surrounding areas remaining mostly unaffected. The most striking change appears to happen with some shape, for example in the first example a shape made of red (value 2) gets some of its pixels copied to the location of an azure (value 8) shape.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

In Example 1, this is the azure (8) shape. In Example 2, it's an azure/light blue shape (8) again, and in Example 3 it's also some kind of a frame made of value 4 (yellow) or value 2 (red) around value 4 (yellow).\n\n2.  **Identify target shape:** Locate the shape that fills in the marker. In Example 1, this is the red (2) shape. In Example 2, it's the light blue (8) again, and in Example 3 it's value 4 (yellow).\n\n3.  **Copy and Replace:** Copy the shape of the \"target\" shape to where the \"marker\" shape, replacing what is there. It overwrites the values in the output grid that are within target shape at the position of the marker.\n\nIn essence, the program identifies a \"marker\" shape and copies the shape of the \"target\" shape to the \"marker\" shape.\n"
