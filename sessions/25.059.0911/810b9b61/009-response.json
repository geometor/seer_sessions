The input contains blue (1) pixels forming distinct shapes. The output seems to retain some of these blue pixels while changing others to green (3). The positions of the blue pixels that remain unchanged seem significant, as do the positions of the new green pixels relative to the original blue ones. The shapes formed are irregular.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
