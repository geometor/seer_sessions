The input grid has two colors: azure (8) and white (0). The output grid also consists of azure and white pixels, but in a different arrangement and size. The core operation seems to be a reduction or extraction of certain elements from the input grid, preserving the relative positions of the colors. A diagonal symmetry could be imagined, where, the top-right and the bottom-left corners contain the same values as each other.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
