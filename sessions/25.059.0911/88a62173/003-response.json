The colors are represented by integers, with 0 being white and 2 being red. The input grid is larger (5x5) than the output grid (2x2). The output grid seems to be a condensed or extracted version of the input, preserving some, but not all, of the input's information. The transformation appears to focus on specific regions or features of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
