**input:**
```
0 2 0 0 2
2 2 0 2 2
0 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 2
2 2 0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7D67D395D850>

**output:**
```
2 2
2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7D67D395D4D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by integers, with 0 being white and 2 being red. The input grid is larger (5x5) than the output grid (2x2). The output grid seems to be a condensed or extracted version of the input, preserving some, but not all, of the input's information. The transformation appears to focus on specific regions or features of the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [height, width]
      cells: [integer values representing colors]
    actions:
      - transformation: reducing dimensions
      - selection: extracting a sub-grid
    relationships:
      - input_grid: relates to output_grid via transformation
  - type: cell
    properties:
      color: [integer value]
      position: [row, column]
    relationships:
      - part_of: grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Top-Left 2x2 Sub-grid:** Focus on the 2x2 sub-grid located at the top-left corner of the input grid.

2. **Extract the values**: copy this 2x2 section
3.  **Output:** The final output *is* the 2x2 extracted part.

In simpler terms, the transformation extracts the top-left 2x2 portion of the input grid and presents it as the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
