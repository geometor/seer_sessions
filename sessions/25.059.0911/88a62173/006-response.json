            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the results, and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was extremely simple, extracting only the top-left 2x2 subgrid. This approach, while correct for the provided training examples, doesn't generalize to any case where different colors or more complex reasoning may be present, but luckily the structure of the training examples is sufficient to identify the pattern. It highlights the importance of having diverse training examples. The results show that this simple rule worked on all given examples. This strongly suggests that the core logic of the task is to isolate a specific region of the input.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nSince all the results show perfect prediction, the strategy is to document a clear and concise natural language program and facts describing the observed transformation, and prepare for any modifications on a test case if needed.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis:**\n\nBecause all of the train examples were successful, there is no need to provide detailed metrics.\n\nAll examples show a consistent pattern:\n*   Input grids have varying dimensions.\n*   Output grids are always 2x2.\n*   Output grid is always the top-left 2x2 section of the input grid.\n*    All pixels in input and output are 'gray' (value 5).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      The output grid consistently represents a 2x2 subgrid extracted from the top-left corner of the input grid.\n  - object_properties:\n      - object: input_grid\n        properties:\n          - type: 2D array\n          - values: integers (0-9) representing colors\n          - dimensions: variable, between 1x1 and 30x30\n      - object: output_grid\n        properties:\n          - type: 2D array\n          - values: integers (0-9) representing colors\n          - dimensions: 2x2, constant\n  - transformation_rule: |\n      The transformation extracts the top-left 2x2 portion of the input grid to create the output grid.\n  - color_consistency:\n      - All input and output grids in provided examples contain only gray (5) pixels.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the top-left corner:** Locate the pixel at the (0, 0) index of the input grid (row 0, column 0).\n2.  **Extract 2x2 subgrid:**  Select the 2x2 area starting from the identified top-left corner. This includes pixels at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) and (1,1).\n3.  **Form the output:**  The selected 2x2 subgrid becomes the output grid.\n\nThis program describes taking a 2x2 subgrid and setting that as the output.\n"
