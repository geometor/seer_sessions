Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into a smaller 2D grid. The input grid has two colors: azure (8) and white (0). The output grid also consists of azure and white pixels, but in a different arrangement and size. The core operation seems to be a reduction or extraction of certain elements from the input grid, preserving the relative positions of the colors. A diagonal symmetry could be imagined, where, the top-right and the bottom-left corners contain the same values as each other.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      shape: 5x5
      colors: [azure, white]
      values: [[8, 8, 0, 0, 8], [8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 8, 8], [8, 0, 0, 8, 0]]
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      shape: 2x2
      colors: [white, azure]
      values: [[0, 8], [8, 0]]
  - transformation:
      type: extraction
      description: "Extract a 2x2 subgrid from the input grid, capturing a representative pattern."
  - relationships:
      - input_grid contains output_grid's elements
      - diagonal_symmetry: "The top-right and bottom-left corner pixels maintain position and color"

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Examine the input grid (5x5) and locate the four corner pixels.
2.  **Extract:** Extract the top-right, top-left, bottom-right and bottom-left pixels.
3. **Construct new grid.** Create the new grid with extracted pixels maintaining relative positions.
4.  **Output:** Return the 2x2 grid as a result.

In simpler terms, the transformation extracts the top-right and bottom-left corner elements of the input grid to form the output grid. Preserving color and the order of the corners.
