The input grids are 5x5, and the output grids are 2x2.  The key seems to be a pattern of alternating colors within the input grid, and some kind of selection or extraction process that creates the output grid. The colors involved change in each example (red/white, blue/white, azure/white), but the white (0) seems consistent as a sort of background or separator. The significant (non-zero) colors seems to form 2x2 blocks in upper-left of the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The non-zero pixels alternate positions in the input grid\n  - observation: size_reduction\n    description: The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid (2x2 vs. 5x5).\n  - observation: color_correspondence\n    description: The colors present in the output grid are a subset of the colors in the input grid.\n  - observation: position:\n      description: The 2x2 output seems to derive, somehow, from the top-left region, although it is not a direct copy\n```"

One of these colors will be white (0).\n2. **Locate Non-Zero Color Blocks:** Examine the top-left 2x2 section, and surrounding pixels. Note the non-zero numbers.\n3. **Extract Top-Left, Bottom-Right, and Diagonals** The output is formed by checking a 2x2 grid at top-left and moving diagonally. The input has an alternating pattern.\n4. **Construct Output:** Create the 2x2 output grid. Place the non-zero pixels in a clockwise spiral starting from the top-left: Top-left, Top-right, Bottom-right, Bottom-Left.\n\nIn summary: extract values of upper left 2 x 2 and place into a clockwise pattern.\n"
