**input:**
```
8 8 0 0 8
8 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0
8 8 0 8 8
8 0 0 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7D67CBEFC1D0>

**output:**
```
0 8
8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7D67CBEFFA50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into a smaller 2D grid. The input grid has two colors: azure (8) and white (0). The output grid also consists of azure and white pixels, but in a different arrangement and size. The core operation seems to be a reduction or extraction of certain elements from the input grid, preserving the relative positions of the colors. A diagonal symmetry could be imagined, where, the top-right and the bottom-left corners contain the same values as each other.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      shape: 5x5
      colors: [azure, white]
      values: [[8, 8, 0, 0, 8], [8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 8, 8], [8, 0, 0, 8, 0]]
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      shape: 2x2
      colors: [white, azure]
      values: [[0, 8], [8, 0]]
  - transformation:
      type: extraction
      description: "Extract a 2x2 subgrid from the input grid, capturing a representative pattern."
  - relationships:
      - input_grid contains output_grid's elements
      - diagonal_symmetry: "The top-right and bottom-left corner pixels maintain position and color"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Examine the input grid (5x5) and locate the four corner pixels.
2.  **Extract:** Extract the top-right, top-left, bottom-right and bottom-left pixels.
3. **Construct new grid.** Create the new grid with extracted pixels maintaining relative positions.
4.  **Output:** Return the 2x2 grid as a result.

In simpler terms, the transformation extracts the top-right and bottom-left corner elements of the input grid to form the output grid. Preserving color and the order of the corners.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
