facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Represents a grid of colored pixels.
    size: variable, between 1x1 and 30x30
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Represents the transformed grid.
    size: variable, appears smaller than input_grid
  - property: color
    values:
      0: white
      5: gray
  - observation: input_grids_contain_gray_objects
    description: Input grids have connected regions of gray pixels (5).
  - observation: output_grids_contain_gray_pixels
    description: Output grids contain only gray pixels (5) and white (0).
  - relationship: transformation
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid.
    details: Gray pixels are extracted and repositioned, white background is mostly discarded.
  - observation: downsampling
     description: the output grid is a smaller representation of the gray areas in the input grid
  - action: extract
    description: Extract gray pixels from the input.
  - action: reposition
    description: Reposition the extracted pixels in the output grid.
