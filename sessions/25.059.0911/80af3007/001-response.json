The input grids appear to contain connected regions of the color gray (5) against a background of white (0). The output grids seem to be a compressed or summarized version of the input, retaining the gray pixels but in a different arrangement and a smaller grid size. The key seems to be extracting and repositioning the gray (5) pixels while discarding the white (0) pixels. The output grid appears to maintain the relative positions of the blocks after downsampling the original objects.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"
