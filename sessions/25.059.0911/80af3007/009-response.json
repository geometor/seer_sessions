The primary color involved is gray (5), with a background of white (0). The input grid contains multiple disconnected regions of gray pixels, while the output seems to be a condensed, altered representation of these regions. The output grid's dimensions are significantly smaller than the input. There's an apparent loss of information, as the output doesn't retain the full structure of the input. It seems like the core concept is about extracting and potentially simplifying or abstracting certain features related to relative placement of isolated color regions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
