"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid.  Since we're taking every other row/col,
    # the output dimensions are half the input, rounded up.
    input_rows, input_cols = input_grid.shape
    output_rows = (input_rows + 1) // 2
    output_cols = (input_cols + 1) // 2
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through odd rows and columns of the input grid.
    for i in range(0, input_rows, 2):
        for j in range(0, input_cols, 2):
            # Map input indices to output indices (integer division by 2).
            output_i = i // 2
            output_j = j // 2

            # Copy the pixel value if it's gray (5).
            if input_grid[i, j] == 5:
                output_grid[output_i, output_j] = 5

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example and implemented a subsampling strategy, copying only gray pixels at odd row/column intersections. This approach clearly doesn't generalize to all training examples. Some examples show different colors being copied, different subsampling patterns (or none at all), and potentially other transformations. The strategy needs to shift from assuming a fixed subsampling rule to dynamically inferring the transformation based on *all* provided examples. We need to observe common patterns, object properties, and relationships *across* examples rather than overfitting to the first one.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1. **Gather Detailed Metrics:** For each example, we need to meticulously compare the input and output grids. This includes:
    - Dimensions of input and output.
    - Colors present in input and output.
    - Relative positions of copied pixels (if any).
    - Any apparent geometric transformations (rotations, reflections, etc.).
    - Presence of objects, and their properties (color, shape, size).

2. **Identify Common Patterns:** Analyze the metrics across *all* examples to find consistent rules. For instance, are certain colors *always* copied?  Is there a consistent spatial relationship between copied pixels in different examples?

3. **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the common patterns, develop a more general and accurate natural language description of the transformation. This description should account for all observed behaviors.

4. **Iterate:** The updated natural language program will guide the generation of new code. We'll repeat the testing and refinement process until the code correctly transforms all training inputs.

**Example Metrics and Analysis (using code execution when needed):**

I will use `print()` statements to represent what I would gather via code execution. In a real environment, I would be executing numpy operations and other analysis code here.
I will simulate code execution reports. I will do this for each example.

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule involves subsampling the input grid by a factor of 2. The output grid's dimensions are approximately half the input grid's dimensions (rounding up).  The color present in the input grid, other than black (0), is identified.  This non-black color from the input grid is copied to the output grid. The copying process selects pixels from the input at odd row and odd column intersections (every other row and every other column, starting from 0).  These selected pixels, if they match the identified non-black color, are copied to corresponding positions in the output grid. The output grid position is calculated by dividing the input row and column indices by 2 (integer division).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
