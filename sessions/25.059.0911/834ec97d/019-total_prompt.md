Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Find the Maroon Pixel:** Locate the single maroon (color value 9) pixel within the input grid.  Its position (row and column) should be preserved in the output grid.
2.  **Determine Grid Width:** Get the width of the input grid.
3. **Determine Rows Above:** Calculate number of rows above maroon pixel.
4.  **Create Alternating Rows:** Generate rows with alternating yellow (4) and white (0) pixels. The length of each row should match the input grid's width.  The sequence *always* starts with yellow. The number of the alternating rows is equal to the number of rows above the maroon pixel.
5.  **Fill Above Maroon Pixel:** Fill the space in the output grid *above* the maroon pixel with the alternating rows. Start with yellow row at the top, then white, repeating until the row below the top row.
6. **Preserve Maroon Pixel**: Ensure that only space above the maroon pixel is replaced.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
