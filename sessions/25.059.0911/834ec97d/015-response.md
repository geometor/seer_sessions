Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 9x9 grid with a single maroon (9) pixel near the center. The rest of the pixels are white (0).
*   The output is a 9x9 grid. It retains the maroon (9) pixel in the same location. Above the maroon pixel are five rows that alternate between yellow (4) and white(0).

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements: pixels
  - type: pixel
    color: maroon
    value: 9
    location: (2, 4) # (column, row) - zero-indexed
  - type: pixel
    color: white
    value: 0
  - type: pixel
    color: yellow
    value: 4

actions:
  - type: retain
    object: maroon pixel
    description: The maroon pixel remains unchanged in its original location.
  - type: add
    object: rows
    description: Five rows of alternating yellow and white pixels are present above original maroon pixel.
    pattern: 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4
             4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4
             4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4
             4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4
             4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4

relationships:
    - type: above
      subject: added rows
      object: maroon pixel
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate** the maroon (9) pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Retain** the maroon (9) pixel in the same location in the output grid.
3.  **Add** rows above the maroon pixel, where each row alternates between yellow (4) and white (0), starting and ending with yellow, and having as many rows to occupy the space above, leaving the rest as white pixels.
