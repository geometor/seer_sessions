The primary element is a single colored pixel (non-white, value > 0) within a grid of otherwise white (0) pixels. The transformation seems to involve adding yellow (4) pixels in a specific pattern related to the position of the initial colored pixel. The size of the grid appears to expand in at least one case.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
