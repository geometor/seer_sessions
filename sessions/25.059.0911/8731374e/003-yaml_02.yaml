task_type: abstraction_and_reasoning
input:
  type: grid
  dimensions: large
  elements: integers (0-9)
  colors: multiple (10)
  pattern: seemingly_random
output:
  type: grid
  dimensions: small
  elements: integers (1, 2)
  colors: two (blue, red)
  pattern: checkerboard
transformation:
  type: size_reduction, color_reduction, pattern_extraction
  details:
    - input grid is significantly larger than output grid
    - output grid uses only two colors, while input has many
    - output grid exhibits a regular, repeating pattern
    - output is likely some abstraction or summary of the input.
objects:
 - input_grid:
    properties:
      - large dimensions
      - multiple colors
      - noisy appearance
 - output_grid:
    properties:
        - small dimensions
        - two colors
        - checkerboard pattern
actions:
- size_reduction: Input grid dimensions transformed to significantly smaller output grid.
- color_reduction: Colors of the input grid simplified down to just two colors in output.
- abstraction: Output grid represents an abstract summary of the input
- pattern_creation: The output is a checkerboard pattern.
relationships:
 - input_to_output:  The output grid is derived from the input grid via an unknown transformation process.
