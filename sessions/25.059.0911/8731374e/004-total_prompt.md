Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large, colorful grid filled with single-digit numbers (0-9), each representing a different color. The output is a much smaller grid, containing only the numbers 1 and 2 (blue and red, respectively). The output grid appears to be a highly simplified, abstracted representation of the input grid. The striking difference in size and the reduction to only two colors suggests a significant transformation. The input grid looks noisy and random, while the output grid exhibits a clear, repeating checkerboard pattern. The dominant colors in the output seem to be derived from prominent features or regions within the input, but the exact nature of those prominences isn't immediately obvious without a deeper analysis of connected regions or color frequencies.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_type: abstraction_and_reasoning
input:
  type: grid
  dimensions: large
  elements: integers (0-9)
  colors: multiple (10)
  pattern: seemingly_random
output:
  type: grid
  dimensions: small
  elements: integers (1, 2)
  colors: two (blue, red)
  pattern: checkerboard
transformation:
  type: size_reduction, color_reduction, pattern_extraction
  details:
    - input grid is significantly larger than output grid
    - output grid uses only two colors, while input has many
    - output grid exhibits a regular, repeating pattern
    - output is likely some abstraction or summary of the input.
objects:
 - input_grid:
    properties:
      - large dimensions
      - multiple colors
      - noisy appearance
 - output_grid:
    properties:
        - small dimensions
        - two colors
        - checkerboard pattern
actions:
- size_reduction: Input grid dimensions transformed to significantly smaller output grid.
- color_reduction: Colors of the input grid simplified down to just two colors in output.
- abstraction: Output grid represents an abstract summary of the input
- pattern_creation: The output is a checkerboard pattern.
relationships:
 - input_to_output:  The output grid is derived from the input grid via an unknown transformation process.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Analyze Input Grid:** Examine the input grid to identify the most frequent color *within the large blue area*.
2. **Identify Central Shape:** Observe that a large, contiguous region of blue (1) dominates the central part of the input.
3. **Outline the Central Shape:** We will draw a boundary around this large blue shape in the original image, then shrink that boundary down significantly and fill with an alternating two colour pattern.
4. **Construct Output Grid Pattern:** Create a smaller output grid with a checkerboard pattern of alternating blue (1) and red (2) pixels.
5. **Determine output grid size**: the output grid will be the minimum bounding box of all blue (1) pixels, with one extra row above and one extra row below.
6. **Map to Output:** The presence of significant blue regions dictates a blue/red checkerboard.

In simpler terms, the program identifies the most common color and it's boundary, simplifies the grid, shrinks to the smallest dimension of the largest boundary and applies a checkerboard pattern using two designated colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
