The outputs are significantly smaller grids, seemingly derived from the inputs, and also composed of single-digit numbers/colors.  There's a clear reduction in size and complexity from input to output. The output grids appear to maintain a symmetrical, almost checkerboard-like or cross-like, pattern in all provided training examples.  The input grids, while appearing chaotic at first glance, contain large contiguous regions of the same color, particularly a large central area, often of blue (1), yellow (4), or azure (8) color. The transformation highlights a small subset of the grid and simplifies them significantly.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Note this color - it will act as the background color of the output grid.\n2. **Determine the Secondary Color** There is one other constant color present in the output. Identify this value.\n3. **Construct the Output Grid Shell:** Create an output grid. Its size is determined based on the central block from the Input Grid. It consists of a grid with alternating pixels, either in a checkerboard style or a cross style, of the two colors.\n4. **Populate Output:** Fill in the output grid with the two colors alternating in the pattern selected from the input grid.\n\nIn summary, the transformation extracts the colors from a simplified section of the input grid, then creates an alternating pattern in the output grid of the two colors.\n"
