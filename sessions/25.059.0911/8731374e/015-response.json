The output is a smaller grid composed of only two colors (azure and red) from the input grid. The output appears to extract a specific pattern, a cross shape, from the input. The dominant color in the large input grid is azure (8). The red (2) forms a plus sign (+) or cross in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this case, it's azure (8).\n2.  **Locate the Cross:** Examine the input grid and search for a cross or plus-shaped structure of same color, not the dominant one. This different color must have continuous horizontal and vertical lines, with same number of this color pixels at both sides.\n3.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** The output is smaller than the input. The size is defined by the horizontal and vertical extent of the non-dominant color forming cross, plus additional rows/columns of dominant color from input\n4.  **Extract:** Create the output grid by copying the identified cross pattern and the surrounding dominant-color background based on determined output size.\n5. The cross pattern has one azure(8) surrounding row in up and down, and has two azure(8) surrounding columns at left and right.\n\n"
