facts:
  - observation: The transformation creates a cross (horizontal and vertical lines) in the output grid.
  - observation: The color of the cross corresponds to the color of a single specific pixel in the input grid.
  - observation: The cross is formed by lines extending to the edges of the grid.
  - observation: The intersection point of the cross is at the location of the specific pixel found in the input grid.
  - observation: The specific pixel's color in the input grid is replaced with '5' in the output grid.
  - input_colors: The relevant pixel can be green (3), orange (7), or red (2) in the given examples.
  - output_color: the input pixel is always replaced with gray (5)
