facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    size: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    description: Input and output are grids of the same size.

  - object: pixel
    type: colored square
    values: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    color_mapping:
      0: white
      2: red
      3: green
      4: yellow
      5: gray
    description: Each cell in the grid is a pixel of a specific color.

  - observation: single_colored_pixel_input
    description: Input grids contain only one non-zero pixel, located in the bottom row.

  - observation: repeating_pattern_output
    description: >
        Output grids exhibit a repeating vertical stripe pattern.
        The pattern consists of the original color and a new color (gray).

  - action: pattern_creation
    type: replication and insertion
    description: >
        The original non-zero pixel's color is replicated vertically.
        Gray pixels are inserted between the replicated colored pixels.

  - relationship: input_output_color
    description: The color of the single non-zero pixel in the input determines one of the colors in the output pattern.

  - relationship: constant
    type: added color
    value: 5
    description: Output grids always include grey color.
