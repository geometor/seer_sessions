The input grids mostly consist of '0' (white) pixels, with a single colored pixel (red, green, or yellow) in the bottom row. The output grids retain the colored pixel from the input but expand it into a repeating pattern.\u00a0 A new color, '5' (gray), is introduced in the output, interleaved with the original color.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
