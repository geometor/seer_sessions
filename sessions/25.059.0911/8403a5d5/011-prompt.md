Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Find the green pixel:** Locate the single green (3) pixel in the input grid. Note its row and column.
2.  **Draw green lines**: In the output grid, draw a vertical line and a horizontal line of green (3) pixels.
    *   The vertical line is at the same column as the original green pixel in the input.
    *   The Horizontal line is at the same row as the original green pixel in the input.
    *   All cells of lines will have value of 3, no empty values.
3.  **Add Gray Highlights**: Add gray (5) pixels in two location:
    *   replace original green pixel location with '5'
    *   replace cell at (row, column) where column = original_column - 1

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
