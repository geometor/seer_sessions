Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Seed:** Locate the single yellow (4) pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Vertical and Horizontal Lines:**  Create vertical and horizontal lines of yellow (4) pixels passing through the seed pixel, extending to the edges of the grid.
3. **Alternating Fill:** Fill the remaining cells with alternating 4 and 0 such that cells adjacent to 4 are either 4 or 0 and never 5.
4.  **Corner Replacement:** In the four corners of resulting checkerboard of 4s and 0s, replace the 0 with 5, if a 4 exist there, the values stays a 4.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
