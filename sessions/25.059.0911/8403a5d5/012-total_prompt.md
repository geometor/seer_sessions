Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Find the green pixel:** Locate the single green (3) pixel in the input grid. Note its row and column.
2.  **Draw green lines**: In the output grid, draw a vertical line and a horizontal line of green (3) pixels.
    *   The vertical line is at the same column as the original green pixel in the input.
    *   The Horizontal line is at the same row as the original green pixel in the input.
    *   All cells of lines will have value of 3, no empty values.
3.  **Add Gray Highlights**: Add gray (5) pixels in two location:
    *   replace original green pixel location with '5'
    *   replace cell at (row, column) where column = original_column - 1

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on observing only the *first* training example.  By testing it against *all* training examples, we can identify where the initial assumptions were too narrow or incorrect.  The provided results show discrepancies between the expected outputs and the outputs generated by the `transform` function.  This is expected and is a crucial part of the iterative learning process.  Our strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Discrepancies:**  For each training example, carefully compare the generated output with the expected output. Identify the specific pixels that differ and why.
2.  **Identify Incorrect Assumptions:**  Based on the discrepancies, determine which parts of the initial natural language program were flawed.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:**  Modify the natural language program to correctly describe the transformation rule that applies to *all* training examples, not just the first.
4. **Fact Gathering:** Focus on what elements are constant in the examples, and determine a general set of rules based on these constant elements.

**Metrics and Observations (using Code Execution and Manual Inspection)**

To aid our analysis, I've used a simple custom made function to describe key characteristics of all training examples, including shapes of the grid and key pixels. This help focus on important features:

```python
def describe_grid(grid):
    """Provides a concise description of a grid."""
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    description = {
        'shape': (rows, cols),
        'min': int(np.min(grid)),
        'max': int(np.max(grid)),
        'unique_values': np.unique(grid).tolist(),
        'green_pixel': find_pixel_by_color(grid, 3)
    }

    return description
```

Here's an analysis of each training example, including the description, the expected output description, and the observed discrepancies:

*   **Example 1:**

    *   Input Description: `{'shape': (11, 20), 'min': 0, 'max': 5, 'unique_values': [0, 3, 5], 'green_pixel': (4, 11)}`
    *   Output Description: `{'shape': (11, 20), 'min': 0, 'max': 5, 'unique_values': [0, 3, 5], 'green_pixel': None}`
    *   Observed Result: Correct. The code works as expected for the first example.
*   **Example 2:**

    *   Input Description: `{'shape': (15, 22), 'min': 0, 'max': 3, 'unique_values': [0, 3], 'green_pixel': (13, 16)}`
    *   Output Description:  `{'shape': (15, 22), 'min': 0, 'max': 5, 'unique_values': [0, 3, 5], 'green_pixel': None}`
    *   Observed Result: **Incorrect**.
        - The code did paint a horizontal and vertical line intersecting at (13, 16)
        - The original green pixel was replaced with `5`
        - But there are not the additional `5` pixels that were added in example one.
*   **Example 3:**

    *   Input Description: `{'shape': (11, 14), 'min': 0, 'max': 3, 'unique_values': [0, 3], 'green_pixel': (2, 5)}`
    *   Output Description: `{'shape': (11, 14), 'min': 0, 'max': 5, 'unique_values': [0, 3, 5], 'green_pixel': None}`
    *   Observed Result: **Incorrect**.
        - The code did paint a horizontal and vertical line intersecting at (2, 5)
        - The original green pixel was replaced with `5`
        - But there are not the additional `5` pixels that were added in example one.

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Each input grid contains a single green (3) pixel.
  - observation: |
      The output grid has horizontal and vertical lines of green (3) pixels.
  - observation: |
      The intersection of the green lines in the output grid corresponds to the position of the original green pixel in the input grid.
  - observation: |
      The pixel in original green location in the output grid is changed to gray (5).
  - rule: |
      The horizontal and vertical lines extend to the edges of the output grid.
  - constraint: |
      The size of output is same as input.
```

**Refined Natural Language Program**

1.  **Locate the Green Pixel:** Find the single green (3) pixel in the input grid and note its row and column coordinates.
2.  **Draw Green Lines:** In the output grid (which is the same size as the input grid), draw a full horizontal and a full vertical line of green (3) pixels, intersecting at the coordinates found in step 1.  These lines extend to the edges of the grid.
3. **Replace original pixel:** Replace the pixel where lines intersect (original green pixel) with '5'.

Based on the new information, the additional gray pixels present in Example 1 do *not* appear to be part of the general transformation rule.  They are specific to that example and should be removed from the general description.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
