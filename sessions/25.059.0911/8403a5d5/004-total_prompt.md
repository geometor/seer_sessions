Okay, let's analyze this input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 10x10 grid, mostly filled with 0 (white) pixels. There's a single 2 (red) pixel at the bottom left (row 9, column 1 if we are zero indexing).
*   The output is also a 10x10 grid. It seems to have a repeating pattern involving 2 (red) and 0 (white) pixels. There are also some 5 (grey) pixels.
*   The single red pixel in the input seems to have "expanded" or "influenced" the entire output grid.
*   There is a specific structure to the distribution of 2,5, and 0 in output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
        majority: true
      - color: red
        value: 2
        location: [9, 1]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: red
        value: 2
      - color: gray
        value: 5
    pattern: repeating
  - action: transformation
    type: pattern_generation
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    rule_based: true
  - relationship: location to pattern
    from: red pixel in input
    to: full pattern, location of 5s and 2s in output

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the output grid being the same size as the input grid (10x10).

2.  **Seed Location:** Identify the location of the non-zero pixel (the red '2') in the input grid. In this case, it's at row 9, column 1.

3.  **Column Propagation:**
    *   Every other column starting from the seed column alternates 2 to the height of the grid.
    *    The seed column is the second column in the output and every other column from there is all 2s.

4.  **Row Propagation**:
    *   The seed row is the tenth row in the output and every other row from there is 2 where it is not a 5.

5.  **Fill with 5s**: Every other cell that is at the interseaction of the propogated rows and columns becomes 5, two cells away from the initial seed cell and each other.

6.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill all the other cells in output by a value of 0.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
