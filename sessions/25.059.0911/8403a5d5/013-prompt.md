Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate the Green Pixel:** Find the single green (3) pixel in the input grid and note its row and column coordinates.
2.  **Draw Green Lines:** In the output grid (which is the same size as the input grid), draw a full horizontal and a full vertical line of green (3) pixels, intersecting at the coordinates found in step 1.  These lines extend to the edges of the grid.
3.  **Replace original pixel:** Replace the pixel where lines intersect (original green pixel) with '5'.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
