The colors used are red (2), blue (1), green (3), and azure (8).  The background is consistently white (0). The key transformation appears to be the insertion of an azure (8) outline within existing colored rectangles. The outlines are always one pixel thick, and the original shape is maintained.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Consider each of these regions as a separate object.\n\n2.  **Create Inner Outline:** For each identified rectangle:\n    *   Determine the boundaries of the rectangle.\n    *   Inset a new rectangle inside, reducing height and width by two.\n    * Change the color of this inset rectangle to azure (8).\n    * If original width or height equal to one or two, skip inset - keep original.\n\n3.  **Output:** The output grid is the same as the input grid, but with the identified rectangles now containing an azure outline. The background (white/0) remains unchanged.\n"
