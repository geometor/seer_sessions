observations:
  - task: "Extract the largest contiguous yellow object from the input grid."
  - objects:
      - name: yellow_shapes
        properties:
          - color: yellow
          - type: contiguous region of pixels
          - size: variable, needs to be determined
      - name: largest_yellow_shape
        properties:
          - derived_from: yellow_shapes
          - selection_criteria: shape with the maximum number of pixels
  - actions:
      - name: find_shapes
        description: Identify all contiguous shapes in the grid, regardless of color.
      - name: filter_yellow_shapes
        description: Select shapes where the color is yellow.
      - name: find_largest_shape
        description: Determine the yellow shape with the maximum number of pixels.
      - name: extract_largest_shape
        description: Create a new grid containing only the pixels of the largest yellow shape, with a tight bounding box.
  - input: 2D grid of colored pixels
  - output: 2D grid containing only the largest contiguous yellow shape from the input, tightly bounding the object.
