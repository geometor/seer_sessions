Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grids appear to contain multiple colored objects, each a contiguous block of pixels of the same color. The output grids are consistently 3x3, and filled with a single color, with some white (0) padding. The color in the output grid seems to correspond to one of the colors present as an object in the input grid. The selected shape in the output seems to be a shape present in the input. It appears the task involves identifying a specific object in the input and reproducing its shape/color in the output, while changing size and grid background to white.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: Contiguous Block
    properties:
      - color: [yellow, green, red, blue, magenta]
      - shape: Variable (rectangle, L-shape, etc.)
      - size: Variable
    actions:
      - selected: True
      - reproduced: True
  - type: Background
    properties:
    - color: white
    - size: 3x3
relationships:
  - output_contains_selected_object: True
  - selected_based_on: Unknown_Criteria
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid to identify all distinct, contiguous blocks of non-white (non-zero) pixels. Consider each block a separate object.
2.  **Select Object:** Choose *one* of these objects based on criteria that are not entirely clear, but might involve:
    *   One unique colored object.
    *   It seems there might be two objects, one of which is an "inner" shape.
3. **Extract Color:** Identify and store the numerical color of the object, based on input and final output correlation.
4. **Extract Shape:** Identify and store the shape of that object.
5. **Create Output:** Construct 3x3 grid, filling all cells by default.
6.  **Reproduce and Resize:** Create and fill the selected shape with the extracted color in the center of the 3x3 grid.
7. **Set background**: set the background to white

The most challenging aspect is determining the selection criteria. From the provided three train examples it isn't obvious. However, the final output only ever shows the *shape* of one object, and never two objects, or a mix of pixels with two colors.
