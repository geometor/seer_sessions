Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify Green Objects: Examine the input grid and identify all distinct contiguous regions (objects) of green (color 3) pixels.  Two green pixels are part of the same object if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
2. Iterate and Copy: For *each* identified green object:
    a. Find the bounding box: determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices that enclose the object.
    b. Extract the object: Create a new grid containing a copy of the green object from the original input using the calculated bounding box to select a sub-grid with the object.
    c. Place into output: create the output by placing the copied object, maintaining shape.
3. Output: The final output is the result of copying all green objects.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
