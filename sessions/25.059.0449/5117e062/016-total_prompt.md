Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (13x13) containing several colored objects. The output is a smaller grid (3x3) containing only red pixels and some blank (white/0) space. The output seems to focus on a specific area and color (red, value 2) within the input. It appears that the output is a magnified and simplified representation of a portion of the input, likely selecting a region where '2' is a prominent color with some simple rule, removing other features.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: red_cluster_1
    type: cluster
    color: red (2)
    shape: irregular
    position: top-left quadrant
  - id: blue_cluster_1
    type: cluster
    color: blue (1)
    shape: irregular
    position: bottom-center
  - id: green_cluster_1
    type: cluster
    color: green (3)
    shape: irregular
    position: center-right
    
  - id: azure_pixel
    type: pixel
    color: azure (8)
    position: isolated, near red_cluster_1
  
  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    size: 3x3
    content:
       - [2, 2, 2]
       - [0, 2, 0]
       - [2, 2, 0]

relations:
  - type: spatial
    description: output grid appears related to the location of the red cluster.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the largest contiguous cluster of red (value 2) pixels in the input grid.**
2.  **Locate the bounding box that fully contains this red cluster.**
3.  **Create a 3x3 output grid.**
4. **Examine the 3x3 subgrid at rows 3,4,5, cols 1,2,3 of the input. Copy those values into the output grid.**

In simple language - Find where the block of red pixels are, and copy the 3x3 area in the top left of the entire input array, starting at index \[2,0] of input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
