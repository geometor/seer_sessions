The transformation seems to involve a combination of replicating the azure pixels and filling areas based on their positions. The output grid has significantly more azure pixels, forming a distinct pattern. It appears there are vertical and diagonal expansions, and potentially some influence from existing azure pixel placement on the final pattern.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Initial Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value 8 (azure) in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Vertical Replication:** For each azure pixel, create a vertical line of azure pixels extending upwards and downwards. The length of the line is determined by its placement in the series, such that the first vertical azure line extends the full height, and the last vertical azure like extends only to the bottom.\n\n3.  **Horizontal Replication:** Every other row has additional azure pixels. The first and second set of rows starting at the top have sections extending outwards. The following rows have a pattern: two rows down and every other column starting at 2, then two more rows down, then skip one row then the next one fills the whole row.\n\n4.  **Diagonal Expansion/Fill:** There is some kind of influence that connects the initial Azure dots and connects them as a series of diagonal lines, creating a zig zag pattern, except for the 1st, 2nd, 5th and 8th lines, but I cannot express it clearly.\n\n5. **Bottom row:** the third to last row is filled completely with azure.\n\nIn summary, the transformation replicates and expands the initial azure pixels vertically, horizontally, and diagonally, filling certain regions to produce the final pattern. There seems to be a simple rule connecting the original azure pixels to create the final output.\n"
