The input contains a few isolated '3' (green) pixels, seemingly scattered without an obvious pattern. The output has significantly more '3' (green) pixels, forming lines and what appears to be a larger, more complex shape \u2013 potentially a spiral or a winding path. The output also retains some '0' (white) pixels, mostly as background or as gaps within the green structure.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The size of this frame should match the size of input grid.\n\n3.  **Maintain Background:** Keep the empty cells in the spiral as '0'. The size of the spiral and the number of turns can vary, but the core structure remains a spiral.\n\nIn essence, the transformation takes sparse green pixels and uses them as seed points to construct an outlined spiral frame. The original green pixels serve as a guide of where the spiral will turn. The output grid is same size of input grid.\n"
