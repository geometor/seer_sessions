Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code attempts to create nested red squares. The initial observation was based on a single example and, as expected, doesn't generalize well to all cases. The primary issue is that the code assumes the output should *always* be nested squares, regardless of the input. The examples demonstrate variability, indicating a dependency between the input structure, and the output structure. We must consider more carefully exactly how to determine the size and position of the red squares based on the input data.

**Metrics and Observations**

To get a more accurate report on the transformation, and to inform the YAML
facts and natural language program, I will use the first example to guide my
observations.

Here's the breakdown of the training examples and results, I'll provide a
description, some metrics, and an assessment of the generated output:

**Example 1**

- **Input:**
```
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 2 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]]
```
- **Expected Output:**
```
[[2 2 2 2 2 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 0 0 2 0 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 2 2 2 2 2]]
```
- **Actual Output:** (Matches Expected)
```
[[2 2 2 2 2 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 0 0 2 0 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 2 2 2 2 2]]
```
- **Metrics:**
  - Input: 5x6, Single red (2) pixel at (2, 3).
  - Output: 5x6, Nested red squares. Outer square encompassing the entire grid. Inner square of size 1x1 at the original red pixel location.
- **Assessment:** The code correctly generates the expected output for this specific case.

**Example 2**

- **Input:**
```
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 2 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
```
- **Expected Output:**
```
[[2 2 2 2 2 2 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 0 0 0 2 0 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 2 2 2 2 2 2]]
```
- **Actual Output:**
```
[[2 2 2 2 2 2 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 2 2 2 2 2 2]]
```
- **Metrics:**
  - Input: 6x7, Single red pixel at (2, 4).
  - Output: 6x7, Nested red squares. Outer square encompassing the entire grid. There appears to be a bug, a single pixel in the inner most square at 4,4 should be a 2, but it isn't.
- **Assessment:**  The code does *not* correctly reproduce the result. It is close. It looks like the initial red pixel is not preserved as the center of the nested square structure.

**Example 3**

- **Input:**
```
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 2 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
```
- **Expected Output:**
```
[[2 2 2 2 2 2 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 0 0 2 0 0 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 2 2 2 2 2 2]]
```
- **Actual Output:**
```
[[2 2 2 2 2 2 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 0 0 0 0 0 2]
 [2 2 2 2 2 2 2]]
```
- **Metrics:**
  - Input: 6x7, single red pixel at (3,3)
  - output: 6x7, nested red squares. Outer square encompassing the entire grid, inner square of size 1x1 at original position of the red pixel.
- **Assessment:** The code does *not* correctly reproduce the result. It appears to have the same issue as Example 2.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [0, 2] # Black and Red
      red_pixels:
        - description: "location of the seed for output generation"
          count: 1
          positions: [] # to be filled in by code evaluation
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [0, 2]
      shape: "same as input_grid"
      pattern: "nested squares"
      outer_square:
        color: 2
        size: "same as input_grid dimensions"
      inner_squares:
        color: 2
        size: "decreases by 2 each level"
        center: "based on the position of input_grid.red_pixels, innermost square should match coordinates"

actions:
  - name: find_red_pixels
    description: Locate the red pixels in the input grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates of red pixels

  - name: create_outer_square
    description: Draw a red square encompassing the entire output grid.
    input: output_grid dimensions
    output: modified output_grid

  - name: create_inner_squares
    description: Draw nested red squares, centered on the original red pixel location.
    input: output_grid, red pixel coordinates
    output: modified output_grid
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Find the coordinates of all red pixels (value 2) within the input grid.
2.  **Outer Square:** Create a red square outline that encompasses the entire output grid. The dimensions of this square are identical to the input grid.
3.  **Nested Squares:** Create nested red squares within the outer square. The center of the nested squares is determined by the position of a red pixel in the input grid.
4.  **Innermost Square:** The innermost square will be a single pixel, if a red pixel from the input grid can be identified. The innermost square's position corresponds to the position of the initial red pixel in the input grid.
5.  **Size Reduction:** Each nested square's side length is reduced by 2 compared to the surrounding square.

**Summary and Next Steps**

The previous code was on the right track but missed a critical detail - maintaining
the center pixel. The natural language program and yaml facts have been updated to
reflect the accurate transformation rule.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
