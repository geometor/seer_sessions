<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=4496x2994 at 0x744068D7A350>Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output examples to discern the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The tasks involve 2D grids containing colored pixels. The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), red (2), and green (3). The transformations appear to involve changes in both the position and arrangement of colored pixels, often forming distinct geometric patterns or shapes. Sometimes a single colored pixel in the input may become a larger, filled shape like the letter 'L', or a spiral, or lines in the output. There might also be background filling.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: pixel
    properties:
      - color: [white, azure, red, green]
      - position: [row, column]
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [height, width]

actions:
  - name: fill
    description: Change the color of a pixel.
  - name: expand
    description: Replicate a pixel's color to adjacent pixels.
  - name: shape_creation
    description: creates shapes like lines, spirals, filled L shapes etc

relationships:
  - adjacency: Pixels are considered adjacent horizontally, vertically, and sometimes diagonally.
  - containment: Shapes are contained within the grid.
  - transformation: Input pixels/grid transform into output pixels/grid according to some rule.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a breakdown of the transformation, based on observing the three example pairs:

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the non-white pixels in the input grid. These pixels act as "seed" points for the transformation.

2.  **Expand and Fill:** Each non-white pixel becomes the starting point for a new shape. The shapes formed appear to trace a spiral-like or winding path.

3. **Color preservation:** The output grid uses the color for each input non-zero pixel.

4. **Specific cases for each example set:**
    *   **Example 1 (azure):** Each azure pixel expands outward creating perpendicular lines forming a spiral.
    *   **Example 2 (red):** Red pixels grow to be filled L shaped regions in the output.
    *   **Example 3 (green):** Green pixels expand similarly to Example 1, creating a spiral.

5. **General Rule** Each non-zero pixel is a seed to a winding/spiral shaped pattern using its color.

Let's refine it further: the spiral pattern is similar across example 1 and example 3,
but example 2 transforms each single pixel to an "L" shaped pattern, therefore it
might be more accurate to assume "L" shaped patterns are developed from
the initial seeds and they are combined together in cases where they meet to
create spirals and lines.

**Revised Natural Language Program**
1. **Identify key pixels:** Find all non-white pixels, these are the seeds
2. **Grow L shapes:** For each seed, grow an "L" shape of the same color.
3. **Combine:** Where two L shapes would intersect, combine them, creating longer
   lines or spirals.

This description seems more accurate, and captures some of the interaction between the grown areas.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
