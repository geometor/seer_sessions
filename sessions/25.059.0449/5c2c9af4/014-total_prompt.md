Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a revised natural language program and strategy.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was designed to find the *first* red pixel in an input grid and draw nested red squares centered on that pixel. This works for the first training example but fails to generalize to other cases where there are multiple red pixels, or more complex transformations are happening, or where the size is not a simple function.

The core issue is that the initial approach makes too strong an assumption: single red pixel as the center of nested squares. The strategy for resolving this involves these key changes:

1.  **Handle Multiple Red Pixels:** The code needs to iterate through *all* red pixels, not just the first one, and treat each as a potential center for a shape (not always nested squares.)

2.  **Generalize Shape Creation:** Instead of only creating nested squares, we need a more general shape identification process. We'll start by identifying that each red pixel forms a square whose corners are defined by other red pixels.

3.  **Refine Shape Drawing:** improve boundary and edge handling.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To understand the failures and refine our approach, let's examine each example pair individually by comparing the input, expected, and actual output grids. Because the outputs are small, visually inspecting them is sufficient.

*   **Example 1:** Input has one red pixel. Output has nested red squares. The code *succeeds* in this case, as it was designed for this scenario.

*   **Example 2:** Input has two red pixels. Output has two single red squares. The code *fails*. It draws squares based on the position of the first red pixel, then it fails to accurately identify the size of the second square.

*   **Example 3:** Input has two red pixels in an L shape. Output is a single red square with a side length of 3. Code *fails*. It draws nested squares on top of each other in the position of the first red pixel.

**YAML Fact Documentation**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input:
        red_pixels: [1]
        red_pixel_locations: [[3, 5]]
      output:
        shape: nested_squares
        centers: [[3, 5]]
        colors: [red]
  - example_2:
      input:
        red_pixels: [2]
        red_pixel_locations: [[2, 2], [6, 6]]
      output:
        shape: squares
        size: "1x1"
        centers: [[2, 2], [6, 6]]
        colors: [red]
  - example_3:
      input:
        red_pixels: [2]
        red_pixel_locations: [[0,0],[2,2]]
      output:
      	shape: square
      	size: "3x3"
      	corners: [[0,0],[2,2]]
      	colors: [red]
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Find Red Pixels:** Locate all red pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Determine bounding box:** For all red pixels, determine the corners of the smallest bounding box.

3.  **Draw Red Outline:** Create an output grid. For each set of red pixels, draw a filled red box on the output grid bounded by these pixels.

4. **Return Output:** Return this modified output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
