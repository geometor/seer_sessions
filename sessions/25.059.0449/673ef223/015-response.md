Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output grids are of the same dimensions (20x10).
*   The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), azure (8), and yellow (4).
*   There are vertical and horizontal lines of red (2) pixels.
*   There are isolated azure (8) pixels within the white (0) region, seemingly surrounded by or adjacent to red (2) lines.
*    In areas where azure and reds interact, in the output the azure appears to expand, and yellow is introduced.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: red_lines
    type: line
    color: red
    orientation:
      - vertical
      - horizontal
    properties:
      - contiguous

  - name: azure_pixels
    type: pixel
    color: azure
    properties:
     - isolated
     - can be adjacent to red lines

  - name: yellow_pixels
    type: pixel
    color: yellow
    properties:
        - appear in output only

  - name: background
    type: fill
    color: white

actions:
  - name: expand_azure
    agent: azure_pixels
    condition: adjacent to red_lines, in area defined by red lines
    result:
      - azure pixels fill contiguous white areas bounded by red_lines
  - name: introduce_yellow
      agent: process
      condition: where original azure was
      result: those pixels become yellow

relationships:
  - red_lines define regions:
    - azure_pixels might reside within these
  - azure_pixels and red_lines have spatial relationship:
    - adjacency triggers transformation
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Lines:** Locate all contiguous horizontal and vertical lines of red (2) pixels. These act as boundaries.
2.  **Identify initial Azure Pixels:** Find all azure (8) pixels.
3. **Fill within boundaries**: identify areas bound by the red lines, and expand the azure (8) pixels to fill any contiguous white (0) areas.
4.  **Introduce Yellow:** Where azure pixels were located in the input grid, replace with yellow (4) in the output grid.
5. **Preserve Red:** The red lines (2) remain unchanged.
6. **Background Remains:** All other white (0) areas not next to existing azure areas remain.
