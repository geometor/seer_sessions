Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the results, and the updated natural language program, designed as a report:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code, designed after observing the first training example, partially captures the transformation logic but fails to generalize correctly to all cases. The primary issues stem from:

1.  **Incorrect Directionality of Lower Azure Expansion:** The lower azure expansion incorrectly expands to the left. It should expand to the right, similar to the upper azure expansion.
2.  **Incomplete Yellow Replacement Condition**: The yellow replacement logic only replaces the first azure pixel to its right. It does not consider multiple or all azure.
3. The red boundary on the right side should mirror the left side.

The strategy to resolve these errors involves:

1.  **Correcting Azure Expansion:** Modify the lower azure expansion to propagate to the right, mirroring the upper expansion's logic.
2.  **Enhancing Yellow Replacement:** Revise the yellow replacement to change all azure pixels to the right of the original yellow.
3.  **Revising red pixel condition:** The red boundary should be on both the right and left side and at the same height as the azure pixel.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a summary of each example, the expected output, and an analysis of the code's output:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Expected Output: Correct.
    *   Code Output: Correct.

```python
import numpy as np
input_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],

    [0, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 0, 2],
    [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

output_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],

    [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])
transform(input_grid) == output_grid

```

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Expected:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 2],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

    *   Actual:

```

```
*   Observation: The yellow replacement did not replace all consecutive azure to the right. The bottom azure expansion is to the left and not the right.

**YAML Fact Representation**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: azure (8)
    role: expanding_region
    seed_points: True
    expansion_direction: right
    constraints:
      - color: red (2)
        type: boundary
      - type: grid_edge
  - color: red (2)
    role: boundary
    description: Acts as a barrier to the azure expansion.
  - color: yellow (4)
    role: replacement
    description: Replaces azure pixels to its right.

actions:
  - name: expand_azure
    description: Expand azure regions to the right from seed points, bounded by red pixels and grid edges.
  - name: replace_with_yellow
    description: Replace all azure pixels to the right of a yellow pixel with yellow.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Key Elements:** Locate all azure (8), red (2), and yellow (4) pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Upper Azure Expansion:** For each azure pixel, if there's a red pixel at the same height and to its left, expand the azure color to the right. Stop the expansion when encountering a red pixel or the edge of the grid.

3.  **Lower Azure Expansion:** For each azure pixel, if there's a red pixel at the same height and to the *right*, expand the azure color to the *right*. Stop the expansion when encountering a red pixel or the edge of the grid.

4. **Yellow Replacement:** For each yellow pixel, replace *all* azure pixels to its right with yellow.

5.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
