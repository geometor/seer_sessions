The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), azure (8), and yellow (4). There are distinct \"objects\" formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The most prominent change is the appearance of azure (8) and yellow (4) regions in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
