Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Boundaries:** Find all contiguous horizontal and vertical lines of red (2) pixels. These constitute the boundaries.
2.  **Locate Initial Azure:** Identify all pixels that are initially colored azure (8).
3.  **Expand Azure:** For each azure pixel, perform a flood fill operation:
    *   Change contiguous white (0) pixels to azure (8).
    *   Stop the flood fill when encountering a red (2) pixel or any color other than white.
4.  **Replace Initial Azure:** After the expansion, change all pixels that were *originally* azure (8) (i.e., before the expansion) to yellow (4).
5.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All pixels that are not white (0) or part of the original azure (8) regions remain in their original colors, including the red boundaries.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
