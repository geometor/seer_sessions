Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), azure (8), and yellow (4). There are distinct shapes formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. The transformation seems to involve some form of replication or expansion of existing colored areas, along with the introduction of new colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
