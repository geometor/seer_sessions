The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), azure (8), and yellow(4). There appear to be distinct regions or objects defined by these colors. The transformation seems to involve some form of expansion or filling of regions based on the initial positions of colored pixels. Specifically, the red(2) color acts as an anchor or border, and the azure (8) color fills the area to the right of the upper red region.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
