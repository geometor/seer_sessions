            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved expanding yellow regions by adding a red border. However, the subsequent examples reveal a more nuanced rule. The code correctly identifies yellow regions but makes an incorrect assumption. It appears the red border replaces, rather than simply fills in, adjacent white cells. Other colors should be unaffected.\n\nMy strategy is as follows:\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** For each example, I'll examine the input, expected output, and actual output of the `transform` function. I will use code execution to get exact pixel counts and identify differences.\n2.  **Fact Gathering:** I'll create a YAML block summarizing key observations about objects (yellow regions), their properties (size, location), and the transformation (red border).\n3.  **Refined Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis, I'll rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation rule, paying close attention to how the red border interacts with existing pixels.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\nHere is the information for each example.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef code_execution(input_grid, expected_output, actual_output):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the input, expected output, and actual output grids.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: The input grid as a NumPy array.\n        expected_output: The expected output grid as a NumPy array.\n        actual_output: The actual output grid produced by the transform function.\n\n    Returns:\n        A dictionary containing analysis results.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    input_yellow_count = np.sum(input_grid == 4)\n    expected_red_count = np.sum(expected_output == 2)\n    actual_red_count = np.sum(actual_output == 2)\n\n    discrepancy = not np.array_equal(expected_output, actual_output)\n    discrepancy_count = np.sum(expected_output != actual_output) if discrepancy else 0\n\n    results = {\n        \"input_yellow_pixels\": int(input_yellow_count),\n        \"expected_red_pixels\": int(expected_red_count),\n        \"actual_red_pixels\": int(actual_red_count),\n        \"discrepancy\": discrepancy,\n        \"discrepancy_count\": int(discrepancy_count),\n    }\n\n    return results\n\ndef find_regions(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous regions of a specific color in the grid.\"\"\"\n    visited = set()\n    regions = []\n\n    def dfs(row, col, current_region):\n        \"\"\"Depth-first search to explore a region.\"\"\"\n        if (\n            row < 0\n            or row >= grid.shape[0]\n            or col < 0\n            or col >= grid.shape[1]\n            or (row, col) in visited\n            or grid[row, col] != color\n        ):\n            return\n\n        visited.add((row, col))\n        current_region.append((row, col))\n\n        dfs(row + 1, col, current_region)\n        dfs(row -
