Both grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), and green (3). There are distinct clusters of azure and green pixels in the input, which appear to be manipulated in the output. The key difference seems to be a mirroring or reflection of the azure (8) objects, relative to the green (3) object, and an expansion in size of the azure objects.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Maintain the distance from the vertical center of the green cluster to the original, and new, azure clusters.\n4.  **Expand:** Duplicate the original azure cluster, and the reflected cluster, so they appear both above and below their original positions, relative to the vertical midpoint of the green area.\n5. **Reproduce Green:** reproduce the green cluster in the same location in the output\n\nIn essence, the transformation uses the green cluster as a \"mirror\" to reflect the azure cluster vertically, and expands it. The green cluster stays in place.\n"
