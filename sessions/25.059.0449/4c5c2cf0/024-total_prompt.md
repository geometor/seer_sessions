Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was a good start, focusing on identifying and mirroring a blue object. However, it seems the mirroring logic and adjoining aren't perfectly capturing the transformation rule, as evidenced by discrepancies in the test results. The code correctly identifies the blue object, but it has problem with connecting mirrored pixels correctly, missing the diagonal connections.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Examine All Examples:** Carefully review each input/output pair, paying close attention to how the blue object is mirrored and adjoined. Focus on diagonal connections and ensure all connected blue parts get mirrored correctly.
2.  **Refine Mirroring Logic:** The current code has comments indicating the complexity of mirroring. The error reports show a lot of pixel mismatches, so improving the mirror operation is key.
3.  **Precise Natural Language Program:** Based on the comprehensive analysis, rewrite the natural language program to explicitly describe the mirroring and adjoining process, highlighting how connectivity is maintained in the mirrored object.

**Example and Results Analysis:**

To gain precise insight, I'll generate code to calculate the number of mismatched pixels for each training example.

```python
import numpy as np

# Provided transform function and helper functions (find_object) would be here

def calculate_mismatched_pixels(predicted_output, expected_output):
    """Calculates the number of mismatched pixels between two grids."""
    return np.sum(predicted_output != expected_output)

# Dummy data for demonstration (replace with actual task data). I will use actual data from the files, once.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Static Elements:** The azure (8) and white (0) pixels remain unchanged throughout the transformation.
2.  **Locate Blue Object:** Find the contiguous block of blue (1) pixels.
3.  **Mirror and Adjoin:**
    *   Create a mirrored copy of the blue object. The mirroring is performed horizontally.
    *   Adjoin the mirrored copy to the right side of the original blue object.
    *   Maintain the cluster connections. If pixels in the original are adjacent (including diagonally), the copied pixels should maintain the connectivity.
4. **Output:** The output grid consists of the unchanged azure and white pixels, along with the original and mirrored blue object, adjoined correctly.

The crucial addition here is the explicit mention of maintaining connectivity, including diagonal connections, during the mirroring and adjoining process. This addresses the observed errors where the mirrored object was not properly connected in some cases.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
