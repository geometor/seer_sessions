Here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed natural language program update:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the core concept of reflecting the azure (8) object across the green (3) object. However, it made an incorrect assumption about expansion. The code expands from the original and reflected, leading to the incorrect doubling of the expansion. Instead, the expansion should happen *before* reflection, and just once, at the ends of the azure object, maintaining correct proportions. The provided code execution reports clearly show the issue. In the first and third examples the predicted output has too many azure clusters, and in the second example, it is missing azure cluster.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Correct the expansion:**. Calculate distances to top and bottom edges, expand, then reflect
2.  **Refine Reflection:** Ensure the reflection is calculated *after* expansion.
3.  **Object Identification:** The code correctly identifies the relevant objects (azure and green clusters). This part is sound.
4.  **Positional Reasoning:** The code uses cluster centers for reflection, which is the correct approach.

**Metrics and Reports:**

Here's a summary based on the provided `code_execution` reports, and expanded reports:

*Example 1:*

```
Example 1: {'azure_clusters_input': 1, 'green_clusters_input': 1, 'azure_clusters_output': 3, 'green_clusters_output': 1, 'azure_clusters_predicted': 6, 'green_clusters_predicted': 1, 'output_equals_predicted': False}
```

*   **Observation:** Predicted output has too many azure clusters. Original has 1, output has 3, and the prediction has 6.

*Example 2:*

```
Example 2: {'azure_clusters_input': 1, 'green_clusters_input': 1, 'azure_clusters_output': 2, 'green_clusters_output': 1, 'azure_clusters_predicted': 0, 'green_clusters_predicted': 1, 'output_equals_predicted': False}
```

*   **Observation:** Predicted output is missing the azure clusters. Original has 1, output has 2, predicted has 0.

*Example 3:*

```
Example 3: {'azure_clusters_input': 1, 'green_clusters_input': 1, 'azure_clusters_output': 3, 'green_clusters_output': 1, 'azure_clusters_predicted': 6, 'green_clusters_predicted': 1, 'output_equals_predicted': False}
```

*   **Observation:**  Predicted output has too many azure clusters. Similar to Example 1.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: azure_cluster
    color: 8
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - reflects
      - expands
  - object: green_cluster
    color: 3
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - axis_of_reflection: true
  - action: reflection
    agent: azure_cluster
    axis: green_cluster_center_row
  - action: expansion
    agent: azure_cluster
    details: extend to top and bottom edges before reflection
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous clusters of azure (color 8) pixels and green (color 3) pixels.
2.  **Green Center:** Determine the row index of the center of the green cluster. This serves as the reflection axis.
3. **Expansion:**
   *   Find the distance from the top of the azure object to the top of the grid. Add the same number of rows to the *top* of the azure object.
   *   Find the distance from the bottom of the azure object to the bottom of the grid. Add the same number of rows to the *bottom* of the azure object.
4.  **Reflect Azure:** Reflect the expanded azure cluster across the horizontal axis defined by the center row of the green cluster. The reflected azure cluster will consist of azure (8) pixels.
5. **Preserve green:** The original green cluster from input remains in same location.
6.  **Output:** Combine the expanded and reflected azure cluster, along with the original green cluster, to create the output grid.
