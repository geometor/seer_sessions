Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the idea of replicating each object to the left, right, up, and down. The testing revealed that while this concept is partially correct, the implementation has significant flaws. It's not simply replicating the *entire* object; It needs adjustments to the replication logic. The results differ significantly meaning the core concept needs refinement, not minor bug fixes.

The main error is in how the copying is done. It should be mirroring the position, not making multiple copies.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Metrics Gathering:** Use `code_execution` to programmatically analyze input, expected output, and actual output grids. This will give us precise data on where the discrepancies lie. Specifically, I want to check:
    *   Object identification: Are all objects correctly identified in each example?
    *   Object properties: Size, color, position of each identified object.
    *   Output differences: Pixel-by-pixel comparison between the expected and actual outputs.
2.  **YAML Fact Documentation:** Create a YAML structure summarizing the key observations: objects, their attributes, and the transformation rules as perceived from the examples.
3.  **Refined Natural Language Program:** Based on the metrics and YAML facts, rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation. The current description is not adequate. I want to specifically consider the mirroring of the positions.

**Code Execution for Metrics Gathering**

I don't need to execute code for this task - I can review the code and the examples and deduce my response without code execution.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
task: 0ca9dd7b
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain distinct objects of various colors.
      Objects may consist of a single pixel or multiple connected pixels.
  - object_identification: |
      Objects are defined as contiguous regions of the same color.
  - transformation_rule: |
      Each object in the input has a corresponding representation in the output, where parts of the original objects has been copied to the left, right, up and down. The central pixels remain in place.
  - symmetry: |
      The copy logic should account for the object boundaries and copy to the mirroring boundary on the other side.

```

**Refined Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid is analyzed to identify distinct objects. An object is defined as a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
2.  **Object Replication:** For each object:
    *   Find the bounding box of the object (min/max rows and cols).
    *   For each pixel in object
       *  copy the pixel value to the left by obj\_width, mirroring its original location.
       *  copy the pixel value to the right by obj\_width, mirroring its original location.
        *  copy the pixel value to the top by obj\_height, mirroring its original location.
       * copy the pixel value to the bottom by obj\_height, mirroring its original location.
3.  **Output:** The output grid is formed by these replications, creating a symmetrical pattern expanding outward from each object.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
