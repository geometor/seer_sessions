        - color: azure (8)
          shape: 3x3 rectangle
          position: top-left corner
        - color: white (0)
          shape: irregular
          position: surrounds azure and fills gaps
        - color: blue (1)
          shape: single pixel
          position: (3, 3)
      output_objects:
        - color: azure (8)
          shape: 3x3 rectangle
          position: top-left corner
        - color: white (0)
          shape: irregular
          position: surrounds azure and fills gaps
        - color: blue (1)
          shape: two connected pixels, mirrored horizontally
          position: (3,3) and (3,6)
      transformations:
        - action: mirror
          object: blue (1) pixel
          axis: horizontal
          notes: Adjoining the mirrored pixel to the right.
  - example_2:
    input_objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: 4x4 rectangle
        position: Top-left
      - color: 'white (0)'
        shape: irregular, fills gaps
        position: fills gaps
      - color: 'blue (1)'

      - color: azure (8)
        shape: 4x4 rectangle
        position: Top-left
      - color: 'white (0)'
        shape: irregular, fills gaps
      - color: 'blue (1)'
        shape: 2x2, a cluster.
        position: starts from (0,7), and (2,6)

    transformations:
      - action: mirror and cluster formation
        object: 'blue (1)'
        axis: horizontal and connect
        notes: Mirrored horizontally and expand adjacent pixels.

  - example_3:
    input_objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: 5x3 rectangle
        position: top-right
      - color: 'white (0)'
        shape: irregular, fills gaps
      - color: blue(1)
        shape: 1x1
        position: (2,1)

        shape: irregular, fills gaps
      - color: blue (1)
        shape: 1x2 horizontally connected pixels
        position: (2,1) and (2, 11)

    transformations:
      - action: copy and connect
        object: blue(1)
        axis: horizontal
        notes: Copy and connect the original blue (1) pixel to the mirrored position.
