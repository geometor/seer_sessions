Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved a simple horizontal replication of a blue object. However, the subsequent examples reveal a more complex mirroring and adjoining behavior, particularly with irregular shapes. The current code attempts to handle adjoining, but it's incomplete and doesn't fully capture the mirroring aspect, especially along diagonals and in non-rectangular shapes.

The strategy to resolve the errors is to:

1.  **Improve Object Identification:** Refine object identification and handling
    non-contiguous objects of the same color.
2.  **Precise Mirroring Logic:** Implement more robust mirroring, accounting for
    the original description.
3.  **Adjoining:** re-examine how the shapes are adjoined.

**Example and Results Analysis**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the discrepancies and what they reveal about the transformation:

*   **Example 1:** (Correct) The initial example worked because it was a
    simple rectangle.
*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect) Shows the expansion of a complex shape of
    blue, demonstrating that there is complex joining.
*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect) Also illustrates the complex shape issue.

Here's a YAML block documenting the facts, and the revised natural language program:

```yaml
facts:
  - task: 63613498
  - type: Mirror and Adjoin Blue Objects
  - objects:
      - color: blue (1)
        description: The primary object to be transformed. The shape may not be regular.
        actions:
          - name: mirror and copy
            details: Each pixel of the blue object is copied to the right, taking into accound adjoining connections.
      - color: azure (8)
        description: static object
        actions: []
      - color: white (0)
        description: background
        actions: []          
  - transformation:
      type: Mirror and adjoin a copy of the blue object.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Blue Object:** Locate all blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
    Treat this collection of pixels as a single, potentially irregular, object.
2.  **Mirror and Copy**: determine the rightmost edge of the blue object, mirror and adjoin a copy of the original blue shape
3.  **Preserve Other Colors:** Ensure that azure (8) and white (0) pixels
    remain unchanged in their original positions.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
