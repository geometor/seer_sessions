Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information, focusing on refining the natural language program and identifying the underlying transformation rule.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the observation that yellow regions in the input are surrounded by a red border in the output. The code correctly implements this, finding contiguous yellow regions and adding a red border where those regions neighbor white cells. The test results confirm this works for Example 1.  However, Examples 2 and 3 reveal a limitation: the red border is *only* applied to white cells, not to cells of *any* color other than yellow. The core concept is correct, but the condition for applying the red border needs to be broadened.

The strategy is to:

1.  **Confirm the observation**: Verify, using the results and visually inspecting the grids, that the rule is indeed to create a red border around yellow regions, regardless of the neighboring cell's color.
2.  **Refine the condition**: The natural language program and subsequently the code, should be adjusted to reflect the broadened condition: "create a red border around each yellow region". The definition of the border should be any cell adjacent to the yellow region.
3.  **No change to region finding:** The `find_regions` function correctly identifies contiguous yellow regions, so that part doesn't require modification.

**Example Metrics and Results Analysis**

Here's a breakdown of the examples, confirming our analysis, using `code_execution` and focusing on the discrepancy between the actual code outputs and the expected outputs, based on the current `transform` function. Note that I am providing the results summary, and the previous messages provide the python array.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   `input_yellow_pixels`: 21
    *   `expected_red_pixels`: 14
    *   `actual_red_pixels`: 14
    *   `discrepancy`: False
    *   `discrepancy_count`: 0

    Analysis: The code works perfectly for this case as all the yellow regions neighbor the border, which are white pixels.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   `input_yellow_pixels`: 6
    *   `expected_red_pixels`: 10
    *   `actual_red_pixels`: 7
    *   `discrepancy`: True
    *   `discrepancy_count`: 3

    Analysis: The code fails in this case. Three red pixels are missing, because some bordering pixels were not white.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   `input_yellow_pixels`: 8
    *   `expected_red_pixels`: 10
    *   `actual_red_pixels`: 5
    *   `discrepancy`: True
    *   `discrepancy_count`: 5

    Analysis: Similar to example 2. Five red pixels are missing.

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: yellow_region
    description: A contiguous area of yellow pixels.
    properties:
      - color: yellow
      - shape: variable
    actions:
      - bordered: "Surrounded by a red border."

  - object: red_border
    description: A set of red pixels adjacent to a yellow_region.
    properties:
      - color: red
    actions:
      - created: "Created around each yellow_region."

  - object: pixel
    description: A single cell in the grid.
    properties:
        - color: "Integer value representing a color (0-9)"
    actions: {}
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Yellow Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of yellow pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Create Red Border:** For each identified yellow region, change the color of all adjacent pixels, *regardless of their original color*, to red. Adjacent means cells above, below, left and right.
3. **Output**: Return modified output_grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
