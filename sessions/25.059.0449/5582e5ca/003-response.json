The input grid contains various colors, while the output grid consists of only one color (yellow, represented by the number 4). The dimensions of the grid appear to remain constant (3x3 in this example). The key element seems to be identifying a specific color from the input and using it to fill the entire output grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
