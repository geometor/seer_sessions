**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x744068CB5DD0>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains various colors, while the output grid consists of only one color (yellow, represented by the number 4). The dimensions of the grid appear to remain constant (3x3 in this example). The key element seems to be identifying a specific color from the input and using it to fill the entire output grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels.
    dimensions:
      - rows: 3
        columns: 3
  - type: object
    description: Pixels are the objects within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: Represented by integers 0-9.
  - type: transformation
    description: The output grid is a uniform color.
    action:
      - name: identify_color
        description: A specific color from the input grid is selected. In this case, yellow (4).
      - name: fill_grid
        description: The entire output grid is filled with the identified color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Color:** Examine the input grid and identify the color yellow, which is represented by the digit 4.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  **Fill with Target Color:** Fill every cell of the output grid with the color yellow (4).

In essence, the transformation replaces all pixels in the input grid with yellow pixels, maintaining the original grid's dimensions. The core logic is to find a specific color (yellow/4) and propagate it across the entire output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
