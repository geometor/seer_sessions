**Perception of Elements:**

The core elements are 3x3 grids. Each cell within the grid contains a single digit (0-9), representing a color. The transformation involves changing all cells of the input grid to a single, uniform color in the output grid. The key seems to be identifying which color from the input grid will be used for the entire output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 3x3
      cells:
        type: integer
        range: 0-9
        represents: color

transformations:
  - uniform_color_change:
      input: grid
      output: grid
      rule: >
        All cells in the output grid have the same color,
        selected based on a specific rule from the input grid.

rules:
 - color_selection:
    method: Find a common color within all the input grids that shows on the upper right corner.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a 3x3 grid where each cell contains a digit representing a color.
2.  **Color Selection:**
    *   Examine the value in the top-right cell of each input grid.
3.  **Output:** Create a new 3x3 grid.
4.  **Uniform Fill:** Fill *all* cells of the output grid with the color determined in step 2.

In essence, the transformation identifies the upper-right corner element and replicates its value to every cell to make the grid uniform.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
