            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine our approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a very simple observation (replacing everything with 6). This worked for the first training example, but it's clearly not the general rule, as it failed on subsequent examples. The strategy needs to shift from finding a single, universal replacement value to understanding a more complex, potentially conditional, transformation rule. We need to look for relationships between input and output grids, not just a blanket change. It is highly likely that the transformation is based on the properties of the objects within the input.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** We need to move beyond treating the grid as a monolithic entity. Identify individual \"objects\" within each input grid. An object will be defined as a contiguous region of pixels of the same color.\n2.  **Property Analysis:** For each identified object, record properties like color, size, position, and shape.\n3.  **Relationship Mapping:** Compare the input and output grids, focusing on how the properties of objects change (or don't change). Look for patterns like:\n    *   Object preservation: Does an object in the input appear in the output (possibly transformed)?\n    *   Color changes: Are specific colors mapped to other colors?\n    *   Positional changes: Are objects moved, rotated, or reflected?\n    *   Size/Shape changes: Are objects resized or reshaped?\n4.  **Conditional Logic:** The transformation rule might be conditional (e.g., \"if an object is blue, change it to red; otherwise, leave it unchanged\"). We need to identify these conditions.\n5. **Iterative refinement**: Test if the transformation rule accounts for all train set examples.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo accurately analyze object properties and transformations, I need to execute code to gather specific data from the input grids. I am providing that information here for the report.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef get_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies contiguous objects within a grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A 2D numpy array representing the grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A dictionary where keys are object IDs (integers) and values are lists\n        of (row, col) tuples representing the object's pixels.\n        Also returns a dictionary mapping object id to color\n    \"\"\"\n\n    objects = {}\n    object_colors = {}\n    visited = set()\n    object_id_counter = 0\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, object_id):\n        if (\n            row < 0\n            or row >= grid.shape[0]\n            or col < 0\n            or col >= grid.shape[1]\n            or (row, col) in visited\n            or grid[row, col] != color\n        ):\n            return\n        visited.add((row, col))\n        if object_id not in objects:\n            objects[object_id] = []\n        objects[object_id].append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, color, object_id)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, color, object_id)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, color, object_id)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, color, object_id)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if (row, col) not in visited:\n                color = grid[row, col]\n                dfs(row, col, color, object_id_counter)\n                object_colors[object_id_counter] = color\n                object_id_counter += 1\n    return objects, object_colors\n\ndef analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a single input-output pair.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: The input grid.\n        output_grid: The output grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A dictionary containing analysis results.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    input_objects, input_object_colors = get_objects(input_grid)\n    output_objects, output_object_colors = get_objects(output_grid)\n\n    #
