**input:**
```
6 8 9
1 8 1
9 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x744068E03350>

**output:**
```
9 9 9
9 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7440707191D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored squares (pixels), each represented by a single digit (0-9). The input grid has a variety of colors, while the output grid is entirely filled with the color corresponding to the digit '9' (maroon). The task appears to be about identifying a specific color/number and then filling the entire output grid with that color/number. The critical element seems to be the digit '9', which is present in the input and dominates the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: varies (input)
      - color: uniform (output)

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - color: mapped from value

actions:
  - identify_dominant:
      criteria: presence of '9'
  - fill_grid:
      value: '9'

relationships:
  - input_grid: contains_pixels
  - output_grid: filled_with_identified_color
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Color:** Examine the input grid and find the presence of the digit '9'. The color corresponding to '9' is the target color (maroon).

2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid (3x3).

3.  **Fill the Output Grid:** Fill every cell of the new grid with the digit '9', effectively making the entire grid the target color.

Essentially, the output will always be a uniform grid with all the cells containing the '9' value.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
