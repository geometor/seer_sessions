Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is: If the input grid contains *any* yellow pixels, create an output grid of the *same dimensions* that is entirely filled with yellow. If there are no yellow pixels present, it is unclear what the output should be, since all given examples *do* have yellow.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid with the same dimensions as the input_grid
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Check for the presence of yellow (4) in the input_grid
    if np.any(input_grid == 4):
        # If yellow is present, fill the output_grid with yellow
        output_grid[:] = 4

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
