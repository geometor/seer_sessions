Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 7x7 grid. Most cells are '0' (white), with a single '8' (azure) cell near the center.
*   **Output:** A 7x7 grid. The initial '8' is maintained, and a symmetrical pattern of '8's is created around it. The pattern resembles a square, rotated 45 degrees (a diamond shape), centered on the original '8'.
*   **Transformation:** The single azure pixel in the input expands outwards in all diagonal directions, creating a diamond-shape.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - color_map:  {0: white, 8: azure}
  - object: initial_pixel
    properties:
       - color: azure (8)
       - location: varies (but central)
    actions:
       - expands: diagonally
  - object: output_pattern
    properties:
       - shape: diamond
       - color: azure (8)
       - symmetry:  around initial_pixel
       - size: determined by grid boundaries
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate the single azure (8) pixel in the input grid. This is the "seed" pixel.
2.  **Expand Diagonally:** From the seed pixel, extend azure (8) pixels outwards in all four diagonal directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right).
3.  **Boundary Condition:** Continue the diagonal expansion until the edge of the grid is reached in each direction. The grid boundaries will form a cut diamond around the intial '8' pixel.
4. All other pixels should have the background value.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
