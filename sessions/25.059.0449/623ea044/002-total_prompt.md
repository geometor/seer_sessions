<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2448x1970 at 0x7440707B2F50>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on elements, a YAML block for facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of varying dimensions, but consistent within each example pair.
*   **Pixels:** Each cell in the grid is a pixel, represented by a single digit (0-9), corresponding to a color.
*   **Objects:** The primary objects appear to be single-colored pixels within the grid. Most of the grid is filled with 0 (white), acting as background.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves replicating the non-zero pixel in a specific pattern. It appears to be a diagonal expansion, possibly with wrapping around the grid edges.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: NonZeroPixel
    properties:
      color:  variable (determined by input pixel value)
      location: (row, col) # Initial location in the input grid
      replicated: true # Indicates the pixel will be copied
    actions:
      replicateDiagonally:
        parameters:
          grid_height: height # height of the grid
          grid_width: width   # width of the grid

relationships:
  - type: InputToOutput
    description:  The output grid is derived from the input grid by replicating the NonZeroPixel diagonally.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Non-Zero Pixel:** Find the single pixel in the input grid that has a non-zero value. Note its color and original (row, column) position.
2.  **Diagonal Replication:** Replicate this pixel diagonally in both directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right).
3.  **Modulo Operation/Edge Wrapping**: use the modulo operator with respect to the length/width in the direction of expansion. The new coordinates for a copy will by ( (row + i) % height, (col + i) % width) and ((row - i) % height, (col - i) % width) where height and width are grid dimensions and row/col are the original row/column location of the non zero pixel. i is the index of the copy.
4.  **Output Grid:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input. Place copies of the identified non-zero pixel value into the output grid according to the diagonal pattern and the edge wrapping rule. All other pixels in the output grid remain 0.

Essentially, the original non-zero pixel acts as a "seed" that grows diagonally, wrapping around the edges of the grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
