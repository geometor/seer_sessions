objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - shape: variable, between 1x1 and 30x30

  - name: orange_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: orange (value 7)
      - location: (row, column) coordinates within the grid

actions:
  - name: find_orange_pixel
    input: grid
    output: location of the orange pixel, or None if not found

  - name: create_orange_cross
    input:
      - grid
      - orange_pixel_location
    output: modified grid
    rules:
      - If an orange pixel is present in the input grid.
      - a cross is generated in the output grid, using orange pixels.
      - The cross consists of two diagonal lines intersecting at the location
        of the original orange pixel.
      - the cross is created in bounds - extending orange pixels only to the
        edges of the grid.
      - If no orange pixel exists in the input, the output is a grid filled
        with black (value 0)
