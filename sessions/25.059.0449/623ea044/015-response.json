Most cells are '0' (white), with a single '8' (azure) cell near the center.\n*   **Output:** A 7x7 grid. The initial '8' is maintained, and a symmetrical pattern of '8's is created around it. The pattern resembles a square, rotated 45 degrees (a diamond shape), centered on the original '8'.\n*   **Transformation:** The single azure pixel in the input expands outwards in all diagonal directions, creating a diamond-shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
