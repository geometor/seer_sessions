Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid (2D array) of pixels, initially mostly filled with the value 0 (white), with a single pixel of value 2 (red) in the input. The output grid has a distinct pattern of 2 (red) pixels, seemingly expanding outwards from the initial red pixel's location, but constrained in an interesting way. The background remains 0 (white). It seems the transformation is focused exclusively on the '2' pixels. The shape resembles a stylized, pixelated "explosion" or "diamond" pattern, expanding to the edges, but with the expansion decreasing as we move away from center.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 15x15
      default_value: 0
      cell_type: integer

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      value: [0, 2]  # Possible pixel values

  - type: pattern
    properties:
      shape: diamond-like
      color: 2
      origin: initial_red_pixel

actions:
  - name: expand_pattern
    description: Creates a diamond-like pattern of red pixels emanating from an origin.

relationships:
   - origin_pixel_to_pattern:  The initial red pixel serves as the center point for the expanding pattern.
   - pattern_to_grid: The expanding pattern occupies some cells in the grid, overwriting their values.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Origin:** Locate the single red pixel (value 2) in the input grid. This is the origin point.
2.  **Vertical and Horizontal Expansion:** from the origin, draw a line of '2's to the edges in each of the vertical and horizontal directions.
3.  **Diagonal Expansion:** Create diagonal lines of pixels with value '2', starting from the origin, going on the diagonals. The length of each line decreases as we move away from the central vertical and horizontal lines created in the last step.
4.  **Complete Pattern:** Continue insetting this cross shape until it reaches the origin.
5.  **Preserve Background:** All other pixels in the grid that are not part of the expanding pattern should retain their original value of 0.

In simpler terms: Draw an inset cross pattern of red pixels (value 2) centered on the location of the original red pixel in the input grid. The cross pattern starts from the edges, and works inwards.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
