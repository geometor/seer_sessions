Both grids are 10x10 and contain single-digit integer values (0-9), representing different colors.  The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), and blue (1). The input grid contains two distinct 2x2 squares: one red and one blue. The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input, maintaining the general structure but with alterations in color and potentially shape/position. There appears to be an interaction between the two colored squares, spreading between them and including them.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
