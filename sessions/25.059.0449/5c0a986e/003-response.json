The input grid contains two 2x2 squares: one blue (1) and one red (2). The output grid seems to retain the 2x2 red square in the same location. The blue square in the input is also a 2x2 square. In the output we see single blue pixels at the four corners of where an expanded square, which is the original plus one row and column added, where the original square was. The same has possibly been done for the red, but since the original is in the center, this can't be confirmed in this first training pair.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
