Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are 10x10 grids.
*   The grids contain pixels of different colors, represented by digits (0-9). Here, we see 0 (white), 1 (blue), and 2 (red).
*   There are two distinct 2x2 squares in the input, one blue and one red.
*   In the output, the blue square's pixels appear to have moved individually, now forming a diagonal line, and the red square appears in different locations, and also seems to have an additional element, with color 2, to it's right, and its bottom.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: blue_square
    type: square
    color: blue (1)
    size: 2x2
    initial_position: (3, 5)  # (row, col) - top-left corner
    movement: diagonal_split

  - id: red_square
    type: square
    color: red (2)
    size: 2x2
    initial_position: (5, 2)
    movement: appears_at_multiple_locations

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The blue and red squares are initially separate.
    status: output shows them still separate, with the blue squares no longer in square formation

actions:
  - object: blue_square
    action: split_and_move
    details: The 2x2 square breaks into individual pixels that move diagonally.

  - object: red_square
    action: move
    details: Appears in output at location to the right, and bottom, extending the shape.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the 2x2 blue square (color 1) and the 2x2 red square (color 2) in the input grid.
2.  **Process Blue Square:** Split the blue square into its four individual blue pixels. Move each of them independently. Place the first blue pixel in the top left of output, and move diagonally down and to the left, one pixel at a time, placing each of the blue pixels.
3.  **Process Red Square:** keep the red pixels in their original relative position, however, move the whole square formation of red, to start in the most right column. Place a red pixel at each location below the red square, and to its right.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
