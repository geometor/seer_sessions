```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the 2x2 blue square (color 1) and the 2x2 red square (color 2) in the input grid.
2.  **Process Blue Square:** Split the blue square into its four individual blue pixels. Move each of them independently. Place the first blue pixel in the top left of output, and move diagonally down and to the left, one pixel at a time, placing each of the blue pixels.
3.  **Process Red Square:** keep the red pixels in their original relative position, however, move the whole square formation of red, to start in the most right column. Place a red pixel at each location below the red square, and to its right.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code captured some aspects of the transformation, specifically the diagonal placement of blue pixels and the horizontal placement of red pixels. However, it's clear that the code doesn't fully generalize to all training examples. The placement logic for both blue and red squares needs adjustments, and there might be additional nuances we haven't captured yet. The main strategy will be to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to the positions of the blue and red squares and how they relate to the output.
2.  **Identify Errors:** Compare the code's output with the expected output for each example. Note the specific discrepancies (e.g., incorrect positions, missing pixels, extra pixels).
3.  **Refine Placement Logic:** Based on the error analysis, adjust the natural language program to describe the correct placement rules for both blue and red pixels. Consider using relative positioning (e.g., "starting from the top-left corner") and directional movements (e.g., "down and to the right").
4. **Test and Iterate:** if we had more tests, we would want to use the updated program to generate new code and test it against the examples. Repeat the analysis and refinement process until the code produces the correct output for all training examples.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution when possible)**

Since I can't execute code directly, I'll have to describe the observations and metrics based on visual inspection of the provided images. For real application, I would write small functions to help determine grid metrics programmatically.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** Blue square at (0,0), Red square at (0, 5).
    *   **Expected Output:** Blue pixels at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3). Red square at (0,6), (0,7), (1,6), (1,7) and additional reds at (5,7),(6,7).
    *   **Code Output:** Matches expected output.
    *   **Observation:** The initial code works correctly for this specific case.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** Blue square at (3, 3), Red square at (5, 2).
    *   **Expected Output:** Blue pixels at (3,0), (4,1), (5,2), (6,3). Red square at (5,6), (5,7), (6,6), (6,7) and additional reds at(2,7) and (3,7).
    *   **Code Output:** Red correct, except additional reds at (2,7) and (3,7). Blue starts in the correct row, but at column 0 instead of using an offset.
    *   **Observation:** The blue pixel placement needs to maintain the original row. The code places additional red pixels incorrectly.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:** Blue square at (1, 6), Red square at (2, 1).
    *   **Expected Output:** Blue pixels at (1,0), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3). Red square at (2,6),(2,7),(3,6),(3,7). Additional Red at (6,7),(7,7)
    *   **Code Output:** Blue placement incorrect - it looks like the rule is to maintain row, but always set col = 0, then diagonal. Incorrect red positions.
    *   **Observation:** Reinforces the incorrect blue placement observed in Example 2. Red is completely wrong, it seems to be a consistent rule, applied incorrectly here.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the 2x2 blue square (color 1) and the 2x2 red square (color 2) within the input grid.

2.  **Process Blue Square:**
    *   Disassemble the 2x2 blue square into four individual blue pixels.
    *   Place the first blue pixel in the first column (column 0) of the same row where the blue square started.
    *   Place the remaining three blue pixels diagonally, one pixel down and one pixel to the right for each subsequent pixel.

3.  **Process Red Square:**
    *    Move the red square to the last two columns of the grid, aligned to the same starting row.
    *   Find the row of the input grid that corresponds to a y-offset of +3 from the original red square location and put a red pixel in the last column. Do the same for +4.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
