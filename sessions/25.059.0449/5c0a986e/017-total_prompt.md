Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the 2x2 blue square (color 1) and the 2x2 red square (color 2) in the input grid.
2.  **Process Blue Square:** Split the blue square into its four individual blue pixels. Move each of them independently. Place the first blue pixel in the top left of output, and move diagonally down and to the left, one pixel at a time, placing each of the blue pixels.
3.  **Process Red Square:** keep the red pixels in their original relative position, however, move the whole square formation of red, to start in the most right column. Place a red pixel at each location below the red square, and to its right.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
