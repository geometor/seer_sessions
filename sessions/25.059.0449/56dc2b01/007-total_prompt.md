Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of red (2) pixels.
2.  **Determine Azure Column Position:** For the *leftmost* red block, find the x-coordinate that is two positions to the left of its leftmost edge.
3. **Conditional Azure Insertion**:
    * If the calculated x-coordinate is greater than or equal to 0 (i.e., within the grid boundaries), insert a vertical column of azure (8) pixels at that x-coordinate. The height of this column matches the height of the input grid.
   * If the calculated x-coordinate is less than 0, *do not modify the input grid*.
4. All other pixels remain in their original positions and retain their colors.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
