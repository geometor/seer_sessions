observations:
  - object: red_pixel_block
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      shape: contiguous block
      leftmost_x: variable
  - object: azure_column
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      shape: vertical line
      height: same as input grid
      x_position:
          relation: two positions to the left of the leftmost red pixel
          conditional: only if x_position >= 0
  - action: insert_azure_column
    precondition: red_pixel_block exists and (leftmost_x of red_pixel_block - 2) >= 0
    operation: set all pixels in the column at x_position to azure (8)
