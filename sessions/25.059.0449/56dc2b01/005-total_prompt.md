Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the contiguous block of green (3) pixels and the contiguous block of red (2) pixels.
2.  **Determine Azure Column Position:** Find the x-coordinate that is two positions to the left of the leftmost edge of the red shape.
3.  **Insert Azure Column:** Create a vertical column of azure (8) pixels at the determined x-coordinate. The height of this column matches the height of the input grid. All cells in this column become azure.
4. The other digits remain in their respective positions.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
