Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** A 10x10 grid with two distinct colored objects. One object is green (3) and located on the left side. The other object is orange (7) and located on the right side. Both objects are irregular, seemingly composed of connected pixels of the same color. The background is white (0).\n*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid containing only the two colored objects (green and orange). The green object is in the first column, the orange object is in the third column, and, the second column is shared by orange on top and green underneath. The relative sizes and vertical positions within their respective parts of output seem related to the size of the connected components of the inputs.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
