Okay, I'm ready to analyze the example pair and provide my observations. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 10x10 grid with two distinct colored objects. One object is green (3) and located on the left side. The other object is orange (7) and located on the right side. Both objects are irregular, seemingly composed of connected pixels of the same color. The background is white (0).
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid containing only the two colored objects (green and orange). The green object is in the first column, the orange object is in the third column, and, the second column is shared by orange on top and green underneath. The relative sizes and vertical positions within their respective parts of output seem related to the size of the connected components of the inputs.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: green_object
    color: green (3)
    type: irregular shape
    position: left side of input grid
    property: connected component

  - id: orange_object
    color: orange (7)
    type: irregular shape
    position: right side of input grid
    property: connected component

  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    type: background
    position: fills the grid

relations:
  - green_object is left of orange_object
  - the two objects are separated

actions:
    - select: Select the connected components
    - resize: output size 3x3
    - combine: place the objects in specified columns, related to size
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct, connected components (objects) in the input grid. In this case green (3) and orange (7).
2.  **Determine Output Grid:** the output is a 3x3 grid
3. **Place Objects:**
    *   The first column will contain all the green pixels vertically stacked.
    *   The third column will contain all the orange pixels vertically stacked
    *   The second column will be the first column stacked on the second
