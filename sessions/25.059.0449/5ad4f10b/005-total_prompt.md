Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Examine the input grid and locate all pixels with the value "8" (azure).

2.  **Bounding Box (Hypothesis):** It is possible that a bounding box around the azure colored pixels is a key idea. I will need more example pairs to test the bounding box idea. If true, create a bounding box around the outter most azure colored pixels.

3.  **Resize to Output:** Resample/Resize the Bounding box contents, into a 3x3 output grid. The method is not clear at this time.

4.  **Eliminate other colors** Set all non-azure (8) pixels to be white (0).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
