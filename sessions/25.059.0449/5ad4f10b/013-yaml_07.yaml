observations:
  - example: 1
    objects:
      - color: red
        type: cluster
        count: 1
        shape: irregular
        centroid: (5, 5)  # Approximate centroid, based on input grid
    transformation:
      - action: scale_and_map
        result: centroid mapped to (1, 1) in output grid
    accuracy: 1.0

  - example: 2
    objects:
      - color: red
        type: cluster
        count: 2
        shape: irregular
        centroids: [(3, 3), (9, 9)]  #approximate
    transformation:
      - action: scale_and_map
        result: centroids mapped to (0,1), and (2,1).  Expected (1,0) and (1,2)
      - action: rotate_ccw #counter clockwise
        result: 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation
    accuracy: 0.1111

  - example: 3
    objects:
     - color: red
       type: cluster
       count: 3
       shape: 3 distinct clusters forming a horizontal line.
       centroids: [(5,3), (5, 5), (5, 7)] #approximate
    transformation:
      - action: scale_and_map
        result: centroids mapped to output (1,0) (1,1) (1,2)
    accuracy: 1.0
