Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and try to discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A large grid (20x25) filled primarily with "0" (white pixels). There are distinct regions of "4" (yellow pixels) forming a large, somewhat rectangular shape. There are also scattered "8" (azure pixels) seemingly randomly placed, some bordering the yellow region, and some isolated.
*   **Output:** A much smaller grid (3x3) containing only "0" (white) and "8" (azure) pixels. The "8" pixels form a sort of frame, with a single "0" in the center.
*   **Dominant Colors:** White (0), Yellow (4) in Input, and Azure (8) and White(0) in Output. The yellow color is completely absent in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: 20x25
    primary_color: 0  # White
    secondary_color: 4 # Yellow
    tertiary_color: 8  # Azure
    yellow_shape: "large, roughly rectangular block"
    azure_placement: "scattered, some bordering yellow, some isolated"

  output_grid:
    dimensions: 3x3
    primary_color: 8  # Azure
    secondary_color: 0 #White
    pattern: "frame of azure, white center"
    colors_missing: [4]

  transformation:
     size: "drastic reduction"
     color_elimination:  "yellow (4) is completely removed"
     color_focus: "azure (8) becomes dominant"
     spatial_relation: "output pattern may relate to the distribution of azure in input"

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Examine the input grid and locate all pixels with the value "8" (azure).

2.  **Bounding Box (Hypothesis):** It is possible that a bounding box around the azure colored pixels is a key idea. I will need more example pairs to test the bounding box idea. If true, create a bounding box around the outter most azure colored pixels.

3.  **Resize to Output:** Resample/Resize the Bounding box contents, into a 3x3 output grid. The method is not clear at this time.

4.  **Eliminate other colors** Set all non-azure (8) pixels to be white (0).

The core idea seems to be focusing on the azure (8) pixels and their spatial arrangement, drastically reducing the grid size, and eliminating the yellow (4) color entirely. It is very unclear how the precise 3x3 output is created. I will need more information to understand how the information within the, hypothesized, bounding box is sampled, resampled, or summarized down to a 3 x 3 grid.
