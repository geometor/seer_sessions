Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids (3x3). The input grids seem to contain various colored objects, while the output grids appear to represent a simplified, abstracted version, focusing on the non-zero color distribution. The color white (0) appears to be a background. The salient colors seem to get extracted and placed in relationship to each other, and perhaps their relative positions in the larger input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (input), 3x3 (output)
      - colors: integers 0-9
      - background_color: 0

  - type: colored_blob
    properties:
     - color: integer (non-zero)
     - position: relative coordinates (x, y)

actions:
  - type: extract
    description: Identify colored blobs (non-zero pixels) in the input grid.
  - type: simplify
    description: Reduce the input grid to a 3x3 output grid.
  - type: reposition
    description: Place the extracted colors in the output grid, maintaining relative spatial relationships or some simplified form.

relationships:
  - input_grid_contains: colored_blobs
  - output_grid_represents: simplified_input
  - output_grid_colors: derived_from: input_grid_colors
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify:** Scan the input grid and identify all contiguous regions (blobs) of non-zero colored pixels. Consider each unique color as a separate object. Ignore the background, which is white (value of 0).

2. **Extract:** For each distinct non-zero color found, note its color value.

3. **Simplify and Map:** Create a 3x3 output grid.

4. **Relative Position Placement**:
   * Divide input image conceptually into nine equal sectors based on the output grid dimensions (3x3). Imagine placing a 3x3 grid over the input image
   * Map the extracted colors found into corresponding quadrants or regions of the 3x3 output grid to maintain approximate spatial arrangement. The dominant/first-encountered non-zero color in each of the nine regions will determine color value for the corresponding cell of output grid
   * If a section in input grid contains only background, the corresponding section in the output grid will become background (0)

In essence, the program extracts the distinct colors from the input grid and places them into a 3x3 grid, roughly preserving their relative positions, based on dividing up the input space into nine segments.
