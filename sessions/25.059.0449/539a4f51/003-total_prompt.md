Previous Code:
```python
"""
The 5x5 input grid is repeated four times in a 2x2 arrangement to partially fill the 10x10 output grid. The top-left corner of the repeated input grids start at coordinates (0,0), (0,5), (5,0) and (5,5) in output coordinates.

All other cells are temporarily given a fill of the last value of the first row of the input.

In columns 0-4, examine the last pixel/value of each column in the input
    a) If that last pixel of the input column is equal to the fill, do nothing
    b) else, change fill values of corresponding output columns to the pixel/value of the last pixel of the input column

In columns 5-9, fill will be value of cell (3,3) of the input.
    Examine columns 5-9 in the output
    a) If the value of that cell is the fill value, do nothing
    b) else change to the the fill value

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
