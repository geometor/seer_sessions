The input grid contains numerical values representing different colors (1-blue, 4-yellow, 6-magenta, 0-white). The output grid appears to be an expansion of the input grid, with some modifications. Specifically, it seems that a pattern of '1' (blue) is introduced, replacing the '0' (white) in certain areas and also forming a kind of border or filler.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
