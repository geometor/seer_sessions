facts:
  - observation: Input grids are expanded to double their height and width in the output grids.
  - observation: The input grid, or a sub-part of it, is replicated multiple times within the output grid.
  - observation: Replication can involve direct copying of the entire input grid.
  - observation: Replication can also involve copying and rotating smaller "tiles" within the input grid.
  - observation: Example 4 shows a tile-based rotation in the replication.
  - object: grid
    properties:
      height: variable
      width: variable
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    actions:
      expand: doubles in size
      replicate: copies itself or subparts
  - object: tile
    properties:
      height: subset of grid height
      width: subset of grid width
    actions:
      rotate: may be rotated during replication (e.g., Example 4)
      copy: copied to other locations
