1. Expand Grid: Double both the height and width of the input grid to create the output grid.
2. Replicate: Copy the *entire* input grid into the top-left quadrant of the output grid.
3. Repeat: Copy the top-left quadrant (which now contains the original input) to the top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right quadrants of the output grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified the core concept of grid expansion and replication. However, a closer examination of all training examples reveals that the replication isn't always a simple mirroring of the entire input grid. Instead, it appears the replication is tile based, and those tiles might undergo *rotations* or other symmetrical operations. The original program works perfectly for some cases, but it doesn't capture the nuances of tile rotations or flips within the replication. The strategy will be to carefully analyze *each* example, identify how repeating "tiles" of the input are positioned in the output, and modify the logic to incorporate these rotational or flipping transformations of the smaller repeating units.

**Metrics and Observations (using code_execution where needed):**

I don't need code execution here. I can manually inspect the results of the provided code output vs. the targets in the training set. I will generate a summary of what I observe by looking at the task examples in context of the code execution (which has already happened.)

*   **Example 1:** The provided code works perfectly. The input grid is replicated four times to fill the doubled output grid.
*   **Example 2:** The provided code works perfectly. The input grid is replicated four times.
*   **Example 3:** The provided code works perfectly. The input grid is replicated four times.
*   **Example 4:** This example highlights a case where the code is *not* perfect. The output grid is created, it has the right overall size, and some colors and blocks exist in the right places, but it is not a complete replica. By visual inspection, we can observe that this time the replication isn't a simple copy but involves rotations of a smaller sub-block (or "tile").

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are expanded to double their height and width in the output grids.
  - observation: The input grid, or a sub-part of it, is replicated multiple times within the output grid.
  - observation: Replication can involve direct copying of the entire input grid.
  - observation: Replication can also involve copying and rotating smaller "tiles" within the input grid.
  - observation: Example 4 shows a tile-based rotation in the replication.
  - object: grid
    properties:
      height: variable
      width: variable
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    actions:
      expand: doubles in size
      replicate: copies itself or subparts
  - object: tile
    properties:
      height: subset of grid height
      width: subset of grid width
    actions:
      rotate: may be rotated during replication (e.g., Example 4)
      copy: copied to other locations

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expand Grid:** Double both the height and width of the input grid to create the output grid.
2.  **Identify Tile:** Determine the repeating tile within the input grid. In simple cases, this may be the entire input grid. In other cases, it could be a smaller rectangular section.
3. **Replicate and Transform Tiles:** Replicate the identified tile to fill the output grid. This replication may involve:
    *   Direct copying of the tile.
    *   Rotating the tile (90, 180, or 270 degrees) before placing it.
    * Potentially flipping/mirroring.
4.  **Fill Output:** Ensure all quadrants of the output grid are filled with appropriately transformed copies of the identified tile.

The key improvement here is the explicit acknowledgement of a "tile" which might be smaller than the entire grid, and the explicit mention of *rotation* (and hinting at other transformation such as mirroring) as part of the replication process. This addresses the issue seen in Example 4 where simple replication failed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
