Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Expand the grid: Double the width and height of the input grid.
2. Replicate Input Pattern: Copy the values in the input grid (except '0's) to the top-left quadrant of the expanded output grid.
3. Fill with '1': Fill all remaining cells in the output with the value '1' (blue).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_height, output_width = input_height * 2, input_width * 2
    output_grid = np.ones((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # change output pixels
    for row in range(input_height):
        for col in range(input_width):
            if input_grid[row, col] != 0:
              output_grid[row, col] = input_grid[row, col]

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program captured the core idea of expanding the grid and replicating a portion of the input. However, it's clear from the results that the replication logic and fill color are not universally correct across all examples. The initial assumption of replicating the top-left quadrant and filling with '1' (blue) is too specific. We need to generalize the pattern replication and filling behavior based on *all* provided examples, not just the first. The strategy will be to:

1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine each input, expected output, and actual output. Identify discrepancies.
2.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Look for consistent rules governing how the input is replicated (or transformed) into the output, paying attention to color and position.
3.  **Generalize:**  Formulate a natural language program that accurately describes the transformation for *all* training examples.
4. **Metrics:** Gather metrics for each example to confirm alignment.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution when necessary):**

```python

def describe_grid(grid):
    """Provides a concise description of a grid."""
    height, width = grid.shape
    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)
    color_counts = {color: np.count_nonzero(grid == color) for color in unique_colors}
    return {
        "height": height,
        "width": width,

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
- task: 3ed85e60
- objects:
  - input_grid: The original grid of pixels.
  - output_grid: The transformed grid of pixels.
  - pixels: Individual cells within the grids, each having a color value.
- properties:
  - height: The number of rows in a grid.
  - width: The number of columns in a grid.
  - color: The value of a pixel, represented by an integer (0-9).
- actions:
  - expand_grid: The input grid's dimensions are doubled.
  - replicate_pattern: The input grid's pattern is replicated in the output grid. The pattern and the non-pattern pixels are both replicated.
  - fill: The output grid is not filled; replication applies to the input
    exactly, including 0's
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expand Grid:** Double both the height and width of the input grid to create the output grid.
2.  **Replicate:** Copy the *entire* input grid into the top-left quadrant of the output grid.
3. **Repeat:** Copy the top-left quadrant (which now contains the original input) to the top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right quadrants of the output grid.

This revised natural language program addresses the shortcomings of the previous version. It correctly captures the replication behavior observed across *all* provided examples, and it removes the incorrect "fill with 1" instruction. The critical update is realizing it's not just the non-zero values, but the *entire* input that gets replicated.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
