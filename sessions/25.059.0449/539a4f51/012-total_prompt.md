Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid contains numerical values representing different colors (1-blue, 4-yellow, 6-magenta, 0-white). The output grid appears to be an expansion of the input grid, with some modifications. Specifically, it seems that a pattern of '1' (blue) is introduced, replacing the '0' (white) in certain areas and also forming a kind of border or filler.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of numerical values representing colors.
    properties:
      - name: dimensions
        description: height and width of the grid
      - name: cells
        description: individual elements within the grid, represented by integers.
      - name: colors
        value:
          0: white
          1: blue
          4: yellow
          6: magenta

actions:
  - name: expansion
    description: Input grid is expanded to a larger size.
  - name: replacement
    description: Some cells in the input are replaced by other values in the output. Original '0' values are subject to this.
  - name: insertion
    description: A background or border of value '1' is inserted into the expanded output.

relationships:
  - input_grid: original smaller grid
  - output_grid: expanded and modified grid
  - color_mapping: integers to colors
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expand the Grid:** Double the width and height of the input grid, in effect, 2x in each dimention.

2.  **Replicate Input Pattern:** Copy all the values in the input grid (except the '0's) to the top-left quadrant of the new expanded output grid, occupying the same coordinates as in the original input.

3.  **Fill with '1':** Fill all remaining cells in the output that are outside of the copied pattern with the value '1' (blue).

In short, the output is created by replicating the colored shape of the input on a doubled and filled canvas of blue color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
