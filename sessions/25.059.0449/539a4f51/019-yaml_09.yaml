observations:
  - example_1:
    input:
      dimensions: (3, 3)
      colors: [blue, red, green]
      objects:
        - 3x3 grid
    output:
      dimensions: (10, 10)
      colors: [blue, red, green]
      objects:
        - 10x10 grid
    transformation:
      - The input grid is duplicated horizontally.
      - Rows are appended to the bottom, following a pattern derived from the input grid's colors. The pattern repeats to fill a 10x10 grid.
  - example_2:
    input:
      dimensions: (2, 2)
      colors: [yellow, gray]
      objects:
        - 2x2 grid
    output:
      dimensions: (10, 10)
      colors: [yellow, gray]
      objects:
         - 10x10 grid
    transformation:
      - The input grid is duplicated horizontally.
      - Rows are appended to the bottom, following a pattern derived from the input grid's colors, repeating to create a 10 x 10 grid.
  - example_3:
    input:
      dimensions: (5, 5)
      colors: [white, magenta, orange, azure, maroon]
      objects:
        - 5x5 grid
    output:
      dimensions: (10, 10)
      colors: [white, magenta, orange, azure, maroon]
      objects:
        - 10x10 grid
    transformation:
      - The input grid is duplicated horizontally.
      - Rows are appended based on the input, repeating the pattern to reach size 10 x 10.
  - example_4:
    input:
      dimensions: (1, 1)
      colors: [red]
      objects:
        - 1x1 grid
    output:
      dimensions: (10, 10)
      colors: [red]
      objects:
        - 10x10 grid
    transformation:
      - The input grid is duplicated horizontally.
      - Rows of the same color are appended to fill 10x10 grid.
