Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Expansion:** Each non-white pixel in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid. The top-left of each 2x2 block will map to row index `r*2`, col index `c*2`, where `r` and `c` are the input row and column of a non-white pixel.
2. **Background:** The background color of the output grid is the same as the most frequent color in the *output* of the example.
3. **Replacement:** Go through each pixel of the input. Replace the area in output corresponding to non-zero pixels, determined by the rule in step 1. If the input pixel is the same as the background color (from step 2), do *not* replace the background of the output.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
