<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2000x1330 at 0x7440707354D0>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements**

The task involves 2D grids containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a specific color change, consistently applied across all examples. Certain colors are modified while other remains same.

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 10x10
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: color_group
    properties:
      - original_colors: [1, 6, 9, 4]
      - transformed_color: [1->1, 6->5, 9->5, 4->5]
      - description: certain color is changed to color 5, while some colors remains as same.

actions:
  - type: color_transformation
    description: specific colors in the input grid are changed into color 5.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **Check** colors that has to changed or not.
    *   color 1 remains the same.
    *   Colors 6,9,4 is transformed to 5.
    *    All the other colors remains the same.
3.  **Create** output grid with transformed values.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
