"""
The transformation rule is to replace all magenta (6) pixels with grey (5) pixels. The dimensions (height and width) of the grid remain unchanged. The process involves iterating through each pixel in the input grid. If a pixel's value is 6 (magenta), it is changed to 5 (grey). All other pixels remain unchanged.
