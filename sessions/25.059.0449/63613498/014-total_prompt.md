Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x10). Several distinct colored objects are present, varying in size and shape. The primary change seems to involve specific color changes. I see a maroon object in the input that has been turned to grey in the output. All the other colored objects are the same.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - objects:
      - description: Contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color.
        properties:
          - color: Defined by the pixel value (0-9).
          - shape: Can be any shape.
          - size: Variable, from single pixels to larger areas.
      - id: green_object_1
        color: 3
        location: top left
        shape: rectangle
        size: 2 x 1
      - id: grey_object_1
        color: 5
        location: top left, below green_object_1
        shape: rectangle
        size: 1 x 1
      - id: yellow_object
        color: 4
        location: top right
        shape: rectangle
        size: 2 x 1
      - id: grey_object_2
        color: 5
        location: left
        shape: rectangle
        size: 1 x 4
      - id: orange_object
        color: 7
        location: middle-left
        shape: rectangle
        size: 1 x 3
      - id: azure_object
        color: 8
        location: bottom-left
        shape: rectangle
        size: 2 x 2
      - id: maroon_object_input
        color: 9
        location: input, bottom-right
        shape: rectangle
        size: 2 x 1
      - id: grey_object_output
        color: 5
        location: output, bottom-right
        shape: rectangle
        size: 2 x 1

  - transformation:
      - type: color_change
        from_object: maroon_object_input
        to_object: grey_object_output
        details: The maroon (9) object in the input is changed to grey (5) in the output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Examine the input grid and identify all contiguous blocks of pixels sharing the same color. These are the objects.
2.  **Locate Maroon Object:** Find the maroon object (color value 9) located at the bottom-right corner of the grid, specifically with the shape of a 2x1 or 1x2 rectangle.
3. **Perform Color change**: Change the color from maroon (9) to grey (5)
4.  **Preserve Other Objects:** Maintain all other objects with no alterations.
5.  **Output:** Construct the output grid, identical to the input grid except for the color modification identified.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
