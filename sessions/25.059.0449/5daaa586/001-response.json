The transformation seems to involve extracting and rearranging specific rows or parts of rows from the input grid to form the output grid.  The consistent presence of a vertical green line (color 3) in the inputs, and its presence in the output suggests it might be a key element. Colors other than the green '3' appear in the output, suggesting a selection process based on the input. The shape and size of the output are significantly different from the input. It is a re-organization and extraction, not an in-place modification.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
