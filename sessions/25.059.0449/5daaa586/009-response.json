This suggests a reduction in size.\n*   The grids contain single-digit numbers, representing colors.\n*   There's a prominent vertical line of '1' (blue) in the input, which seems to be preserved in the output.\n*   There are horizontal lines of '8' (light blue), '6'(pink) and a column of '4' (yellow) in the input that seem important for the transformation.\n* some '8' pixels are maintained, others are turned to '0'.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Locate the horizontal line of '8' (light blue) at row three. Locate the horizontal line of color '6'(pink) at row ten. Locate the vertical line of '4'(yellow) at the third column.\n\n2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Focus on a sub-grid region. The left border is the column of '4's, the right border is the column of '1'. The upper bound is the row of '8's, the lower bound is the row of '6's.\n\n3.  **Output Generation:** Create the output grid. Maintain every pixel in the sub-grid, replace all other sub-grid pixels in columns 3,4,5,6 with '0'.\n\n"
