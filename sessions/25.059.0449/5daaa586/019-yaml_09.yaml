example_1:
  input_objects:
    - row_1: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8]
    - row_2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    - row_3: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8]
    - row_4: [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8]
    - row_5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    - row_6: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8]
  output_objects:
    - row_1: [8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8]
    - row_2: [8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8]
    - row_3: [8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8]
  transformations:
    - Select rows containing only color 8 and optionally 0.
    - Replace 0 with 4, keep 8.
    - Compress runs of 8's down to a single 8.
    - Insert 4 between adjacent 8's.
    - Remove rows that are all 0's.

example_2:
  input_objects:
    - object_1: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # All rows are identical
  output_objects:
      - object_1: [3] #all rows are [3]
  transformations:
    - Select rows containing color 3 and optionally 0.
    - remove all 0's

example_3:
  input_objects:
     - object_1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
  output_objects:
    - object_1: [5]
  transformations:
     - Select rows containing the color 5 and optionally 0.

example_4:
  input_objects:
    - row_1: [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
  output_objects:
    - row_1: [6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6]
  transformations:
    - Select rows containing color 6 and optionally 0.
    - remove all 0.
    - Insert 4 between adjacent 6's.

example_5:
  input_objects:
     - object_1: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  output_objects:
    - object_1: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
  transformations:
      - Select a row with 7s.
      - Keep all 7's
      - remove 0's
