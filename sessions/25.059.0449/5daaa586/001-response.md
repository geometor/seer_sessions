Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on elements, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.  The transformation seems to involve extracting and rearranging specific rows or parts of rows from the input grid to form the output grid.  The consistent presence of a vertical green line (color 3) in the inputs, and its presence in the output suggests it might be a key element. Colors other than the green '3' appear in the output, suggesting a selection process based on the input. The shape and size of the output are significantly different from the input. It is a re-organization and extraction, not an in-place modification.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9)
      properties:
        rows: variable number
        columns: variable number
  - row:
    type: 1D array
    elements: integers from grid
    properties:
        length: number of columns in the original grid or sub-grid
  - vertical_line:
      type: 1D array
      element: 3
      properties:
          position: variable, defines where the rows above will be cut
actions:
  - extract: Select specific rows or parts of rows based on color and possibly position relative to the vertical green line
  - rearrange:  Order extracted rows to form the output grid.
relationships:
  -  vertical_line_row_division:  The vertical green line(color 3) seems to act as a dividing marker for selecting sub-rows to keep in the output.
  - row_content_based_selection: Specific colors (and potentially their surrounding context) influence whether a row (or a portion of it) is included in the output.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the Vertical Line:** Locate the vertical line composed entirely of the color 3 (green) in the input grid.

2. **Segment Rows:** Divide the input grid into horizontal rows.

3. **Row Selection and Extraction:** For each row, determine if any horizontal line exist, and select the portion of the row on right of the green line (3).

4. **Rearrange selected rows:** Combine these rows from up to down to create the output grid.
