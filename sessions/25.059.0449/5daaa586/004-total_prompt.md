Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task example.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of different dimensions.
*   The input grid has a vertical line of green (3) pixels.
*   There is a horizontal line of blue (1) at the top, a horizontal line of red (2) at the bottom.
*    Azure (8) forms a vertical line at the right border.
*   Scattered red (2) pixels are within the input grid, predominantly near the green line and the right border (azure).
*   The output grid is smaller than the input grid.
*   The output grid retains the green vertical line (now at the left edge, first column), the azure (8) vertical line, and some of the red pixels (2) from the input, positioning them at the far right of the output grid.
* The top row of the output appears to inherit from the top row of the input, but with most of the elements removed

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: green_line
    color: green
    shape: vertical line
    initial_position: column 6
    final_position: column 1

  - id: azure_line
    color: azure
    shape: vertical line
    initial_position: column 17
    final_position: last column

  - id: red_pixels
    color: red
    shape: scattered pixels
    initial_position: various
    final_position: clustered towards right edge

  - id: blue_line
    color: blue
    shape: horizontal line
    initial_position: row 2
    final_position: removed

  - id: bottom_red_line
    color: red
    shape: horizontal line
    initial_position: row 16
    final_position: removed

  - id: white_background
    color: white
    shape: background fills

properties:
  - grid_size: changes from input to output
  - relative_position: green and azure lines maintain relative vertical positions.
  - pixel_inclusion: output includes the input's green line and azure line, and some red pixels.

actions:
  - select: Green line, Azure line, some red pixels
  - crop: remove rows, remove empty columns between the green line and azure line

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Locate the vertical green line, the vertical azure line, the horizontal blue line, the horizontal red line and the scattered red pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Select:** Select the green line, the azure line, and all red pixels.

3.  **Crop/Resize:**
    *   Remove the top blue horizontal line and bottom red horizontal line.
    *   Keep the columns containing the selected objects.
    *    Remove all rows above the highest and below the lowest selected pixels in the selected columns.

4. **Create new output**.
 *   Place selected Green line at the first column
 *  Place Azure line as the last column
 *   Place selected red pixels, maintaining their relative vertical positions within the new grid, towards the right, adjacent to the Azure line.
*    Fill background in white (0)

In essence, the transformation isolates the green and azure vertical lines and some red pixels, removes the empty columns, then reconstructs a smaller grid with these elements. The top blue line and bottom red line are discarded.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
