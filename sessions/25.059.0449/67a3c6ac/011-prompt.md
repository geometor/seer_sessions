Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a "double reflection" or a 180-degree rotation.

1. **Horizontal Reflection:** For each pixel in the input grid, its corresponding pixel in the output grid is located at the horizontally mirrored position. Specifically, if a pixel is `x` positions away from the center column in the input, its corresponding pixel in the output is `x` positions away from the center column on the *opposite* side.

2. **Vertical Reflection:** Simultaneously, the same principle applies vertically. If a pixel is `y` positions away from the center row in the input, its output counterpart is `y` positions away from the center row on the *opposite* side.

3. Center point: Because the array has a odd number of rows and columns (7x7), the array will be reflected over the center point, (3,3).

In essence, each pixel's position is inverted relative to both the center column and the center row. This is equivalent to rotating the entire grid by 180 degrees around its center point.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
