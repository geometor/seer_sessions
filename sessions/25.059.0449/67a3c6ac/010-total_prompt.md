Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (7x7). The colors are represented by single-digit integers (1, 2, 6, 7). Visual inspection suggests a mirroring or reflection operation, but it's not a simple horizontal or vertical flip. The transformation seems to operate on individual pixels based on their spatial relationship to the grid's axes.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color: [1, 2, 6, 7]  # Representing blue, red, magenta, orange
  - type: transformation
    description: "Pixel mirroring across both horizontal and vertical axes."
    operations:
        - name: horizontal_mirror
          details: "Each pixel's horizontal position is inverted relative to the center column."
        - name: vertical_mirror
          details: "Each pixel's vertical position is inverted relative to the center row."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule can be described as a "double reflection" or a 180-degree rotation.

1.  **Horizontal Reflection:** For each pixel in the input grid, its corresponding pixel in the output grid is located at the horizontally mirrored position. Specifically, if a pixel is `x` positions away from the center column in the input, its corresponding pixel in the output is `x` positions away from the center column on the *opposite* side.

2.  **Vertical Reflection:** Simultaneously, the same principle applies vertically. If a pixel is `y` positions away from the center row in the input, its output counterpart is `y` positions away from the center row on the *opposite* side.

3. Center point: Because the array has a odd number of rows and columns (7x7), the array will be reflected over the center point, (3,3).

In essence, each pixel's position is inverted relative to both the center column and the center row. This is equivalent to rotating the entire grid by 180 degrees around its center point.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
