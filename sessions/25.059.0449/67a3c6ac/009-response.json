The input and output grids have the same dimensions (7x7). The colors are represented by single-digit integers (1, 2, 6, 7). Visual inspection suggests a mirroring or reflection operation, but it's not a simple horizontal or vertical flip. The transformation seems to operate on individual pixels based on their spatial relationship to the grid's axes.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Specifically, if a pixel is `x` positions away from the center column in the input, its corresponding pixel in the output is `x` positions away from the center column on the *opposite* side.\n\n2.  **Vertical Reflection:** Simultaneously, the same principle applies vertically. If a pixel is `y` positions away from the center row in the input, its output counterpart is `y` positions away from the center row on the *opposite* side.\n\n3. Center point: Because the array has a odd number of rows and columns (7x7), the array will be reflected over the center point, (3,3).\n\nIn essence, each pixel's position is inverted relative to both the center column and the center row. This is equivalent to rotating the entire grid by 180 degrees around its center point.\n"
