"""
Unable to determine a universally applicable transformation rule. The initial hypothesis of mirroring along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal only works for the first training example.  Further analysis is required to identify the correct transformation, potentially involving object-based reasoning and conditional operations. This code currently implements the *incorrect* transformation, serving as a placeholder for future revisions.
