Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a 180-degree rotation of the entire input grid. This is equivalent to performing both a horizontal and a vertical reflection.

1.  **Center Point:** Imagine a center point in the grid.  For grids with odd dimensions, this is the exact middle pixel.

2.  **Horizontal Reflection:** Each pixel's horizontal distance from the center is inverted. A pixel `x` units to the right of center in the input becomes `x` units to the left of center in the output, and vice versa.

3.  **Vertical Reflection:** Each pixel's vertical distance from the center is inverted. A pixel `y` units below the center in the input becomes `y` units above the center in the output, and vice versa.

4. **Combined Effect:** Steps 2 and 3 together achieve a 180-degree rotation around the grid's center.  The pixel at position (i, j) in the input grid moves to position (rows - 1 - i, cols - 1- j) in the output grid.

            mirrored_j = cols - 1 - j

            # assign pixel value from input to corresponding mirrored position in output

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
