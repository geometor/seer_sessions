Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and the proposed transformation rule for the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid of colored pixels.  The colors are represented by single digits (0-9). The input and output grids have the same dimensions (4x4 in this case). The transformation appears to involve a rotation of some kind, with the positions and/or colors of some elements changing.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 4x4
      elements: pixels
      colors: [1, 2, 6, 7] # blue, red, magenta, orange

actions:
  - type: rotation
    description: 90 degree counter-clockwise
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input Interpretation**: The input is a 4x4 grid of colored pixels.

2.  **Transformation**: The entire grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

3.  **Output**:  The output grid reflects this rotation, mapping all pixels to their new location after the rotation.
