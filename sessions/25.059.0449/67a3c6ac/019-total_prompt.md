Previous Code:
```python
"""
Unable to determine a universally applicable transformation rule. The initial hypothesis of mirroring along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal only works for the first training example.  Further analysis is required to identify the correct transformation, potentially involving object-based reasoning and conditional operations. This code currently implements the *incorrect* transformation, serving as a placeholder for future revisions.

    This is a placeholder and will be replaced with the correct logic once it's determined.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
