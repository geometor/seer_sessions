facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain connected components (objects) of non-zero pixels.
  - object_property: |
      Non-zero pixels represent distinct colors (blue=1, green=3, red=2).
  - object_property: |
      Zero pixels represent the background (white).
  - transformation: |
      The original object expands vertically downwards.
  - transformation_detail: |
      The height of the output grid is greater than or equal to the height of the input. The output height appears to be almost double the height of the original shape (it might stop at the boundary of 10).
  - constraint: output grid height is at max 10.
