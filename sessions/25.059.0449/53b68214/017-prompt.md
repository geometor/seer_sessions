Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to identify the pattern of red pixels in the input grid, extend the grid by two rows,
and continue the pattern of red pixels in the extended rows, filling the rest with white pixels.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Extends the input grid by two rows and continues an alternating red pixel pattern.
    """
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_height = input_height + 2
    output_width = input_width
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # Copy existing pattern
    output_grid[:input_height, :] = input_grid

    # Extend the pattern
    for row in range(input_height, output_height):
        for col in range(2):  # First two columns
          if (row % 2 == 0 and col==0) or (row % 2 !=0 and col ==1) :
            output_grid[row, col] = 2

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
