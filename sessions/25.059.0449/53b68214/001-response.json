The input grids transform into output grids of potentially different dimensions. The primary change seems to be an expansion or padding of the original shape formed by non-zero pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The output height appears to be almost double the height of the original shape (it might stop at the boundary of 10).\n  - constraint: output grid height is at max 10.\n\n```"

This constitutes the primary object.\n2.  **Vertical Extension:** Extend the object downwards. Every non zero pixel should have identical non-zero pixels with the same values below it to fill up the canvas, until row 9 (index starts with 0). If the shape is already occupying row 9, it won't be extended further down.\n3. The dimension of output should always have height of 10.\n\nEssentially, the transformation rule is a vertical downward extension of the input shape, making it occupy more rows downwards until the height of grid is 10.\n"
