Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, focusing on identifying a blue object and expanding the grid based on its dimensions. However, the provided feedback indicates that this approach doesn't fully capture the transformation rule, as evidenced by failures in some training examples.

The core issue seems to be that the initial approach is *too* focused on a single, contiguous blue object. The examples suggest a more nuanced rule is at play that may be related to rows or columns.

My strategy will be:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, including the reported results (pass/fail). I will use the provided python function transform to execute the transformation and inspect the resulting grid, so I can understand _why_ certain examples failed.
2.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Look for consistent patterns across all examples, paying close attention to how blue pixels (and potentially others) are handled, even when not part of a single contiguous object.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program description to reflect a more generalized rule that accounts for all observed behaviors.
4. **Prepare YAML for coder:** Create a YAML summary to include everything that would be useful for generating an updated python function

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To thoroughly analyze each example, I need to be able to execute the code and view each input/output and result. Given that, I will consolidate all the information in the YAML.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

The transformation rule identifies all blue pixels (color 1) in the input grid. For each blue pixel, a new blue pixel is added immediately to its right. The dimensions of the grid are adjusted as needed to accommodate the new pixels, but existing non-blue pixels are not moved or changed.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
