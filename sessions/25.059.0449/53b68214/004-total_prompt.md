Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, where each pixel can be one of two colors: blue (represented by '1') or white (represented by '0'). The input grid appears to contain a single connected blue object on a white background. The output grid seems to be an expansion of the blue shape in the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_shape
    type: connected_pixels
    color: blue
    initial_position: top-left
    properties:
      - contiguous: true
  - name: background
    type: grid
    color: white
    properties:
      - fill: true

actions:
  - name: expand
    object: blue_shape
    properties:
      - direction: down,right
      - amount: add rows and columns maintaining connectedness
      - fill: true

relationships:
  - type: inside
    object1: blue_shape
    object2: background
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the blue object:** Locate the connected region of blue pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Expand Down:** Add rows at bottom. The number of rows add is equal to the height of the initial shape * 2/3 rounded up. The color of cells are defined by the original shape extended down.
3. **Expand Right**: Add columns at the right. The number of columns is equal to the height of the original shape. The color of cells are defined by the original shape, extended to the right.

In essence, the transformation rule takes the connected blue shape and expands it downwards and to the right, creating extra space with the object stretched down and to the right.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
