<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2000x1202 at 0x744068DB7750>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The tasks involve 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit representing a color. The input grids transform into output grids of potentially different dimensions. The primary change seems to be an expansion or padding of the original shape formed by non-zero pixels.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain connected components (objects) of non-zero pixels.
  - object_property: |
      Non-zero pixels represent distinct colors (blue=1, green=3, red=2).
  - object_property: |
      Zero pixels represent the background (white).
  - transformation: |
      The original object expands vertically downwards.
  - transformation_detail: |
      The height of the output grid is greater than or equal to the height of the input. The output height appears to be almost double the height of the original shape (it might stop at the boundary of 10).
  - constraint: output grid height is at max 10.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the contiguous block of non-zero pixels within the input grid. This constitutes the primary object.
2.  **Vertical Extension:** Extend the object downwards. Every non zero pixel should have identical non-zero pixels with the same values below it to fill up the canvas, until row 9 (index starts with 0). If the shape is already occupying row 9, it won't be extended further down.
3. The dimension of output should always have height of 10.

Essentially, the transformation rule is a vertical downward extension of the input shape, making it occupy more rows downwards until the height of grid is 10.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
