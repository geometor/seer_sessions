The input grid appears to contain a single connected blue object on a white background. The output grid seems to be an expansion of the blue shape in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The number of rows add is equal to the height of the initial shape * 2/3 rounded up. The color of cells are defined by the original shape extended down.\n3. **Expand Right**: Add columns at the right. The number of columns is equal to the height of the original shape. The color of cells are defined by the original shape, extended to the right.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule takes the connected blue shape and expands it downwards and to the right, creating extra space with the object stretched down and to the right.\n"
