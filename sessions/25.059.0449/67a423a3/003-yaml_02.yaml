facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output are 2D grids of integers.
  - dimensions: |
      Both grids are 4x4.
  - colors: |
      Input grid contains colors 0 (white), 2 (red), and 3 (green).
      Output grid contains colors 0 (white), 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).
  - unchanged_pixels: |
       Green (3) and Red(2) pixels in the input retain their colors in the output.
  - color_change: |
       Some White (0) pixels in input become Yellow (4) pixels in output.
  - potential_rule: |
      The transformation of white pixels to yellow pixels might be dependent on adjacency to other colored pixels.
