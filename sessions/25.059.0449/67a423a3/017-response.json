            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code were a good first attempt, focusing on the adjacency of blue pixels and changing the color of specific neighboring pixels. However, the provided results will help highlight any errors or omissions from the provided program. The execution did what was asked, and correctly transformed when white and maroon pixels were next to blue. Other colors were left alone.\n\nMy strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Examine Each Example:** Carefully compare the input, expected output, and actual output for each training example.\n2.  **Identify Discrepancies:** Pinpoint where the actual output differs from the expected output.\n3.  **Analyze the Cause:** Determine *why* the code produced an incorrect result. This might involve revisiting the assumptions, boundary conditions, or overlooked aspects of the transformation.\n4.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Modify the natural language description to accurately capture the observed transformation rule, incorporating the new insights.\n5. **Document in YAML and a natural language program:** Structure observations in a report.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo gather metrics, I will examine the shape and color of objects. I'll check the output against the expected output, and report on the difference.\n\nHere are the metrics for each example.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n*   **Input Grid:** 7x7\n*    Objects\n    *   Blue square (1) at center\n    *   Maroon and white surrounding the center\n*   **Expected Output Grid:** 7x7\n*    Objects\n    *    Blue square at center\n    *    Yellow square surrounding the center\n    *   Outermost layer is unchanged\n*   **Actual Output Grid:** 7x7\n*    Objects\n    *    Blue square at center\n    *    Yellow square surrounding the center\n    *   Outermost layer is unchanged\n*    Result\n    *    Matches the expected output\n\n**Example 2**\n\n*   **Input Grid:** 9x9\n*    Objects\n    *   Blue square (1) at center\n    *   Orange, red, and white surrounding the center\n*   **Expected Output Grid:** 9x9\n*    Objects\n    *    Blue square at center\n    *    Yellow square surrounding the center\n    *   Outermost layer is unchanged\n*   **Actual Output Grid:** 9x9\n*    Objects\n    *    Blue square at center\n    *    Yellow square surrounding the center\n    *   Outermost layer is unchanged\n*    Result\n    *    Matches the expected output\n\n**Example 3**\n\n*   **Input Grid:** 11x11\n*    Objects\n    *   Blue square (1) at center\n    *  Green, Grey, White and magenta surrounding the center\n*   **Expected Output Grid:** 11x11\n*    Objects\n    *    Blue square at center\n    *    Yellow square surrounding the center\n    *   Outermost layer is unchanged\n*   **Actual Output Grid:** 11x11\n*    Objects\n    *    Blue square at center\n    *    Yellow square surrounding the center\n    *   Outermost layer is unchanged\n*    Result\n    *    Matches the expected output\n\n**YAML Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example: 1\n    input_shape: 7x7\n    output_shape: 7x7\n    objects:\n      - type: blue_square\n        input_location: center\n        output_location: center\n        color_change: none\n      - type: adjacent_pixels\n        input_color: [white, maroon]\n        output_color: yellow\n        relation: adjacent to blue square\n    transformation: \"Change adjacent white/maroon pixels to yellow\"\n    result: match\n\n  - example: 2\n    input_shape: 9x9\n    output_shape: 9x9\n    objects:\n      - type: blue_square\n        input_location: center\n        output_location: center\n        color_change: none\n      - type: adjacent_pixels\n        input_color: [white, orange, red]\n        output_color: [yellow, orange, red]\n        relation: adjacent to blue square\n    transformation: \"Change adjacent white pixels to yellow; leave orange and red\"\n    result: match\n\n  - example: 3\n    input_shape: 11x11\n    output_shape: 11x11\n    objects:\n      - type: blue_square\n        input_location: center\n        output_location: center\n        color_change: none\n      - type: adjacent_pixels\n        input_color: [white, green, gray, magenta]\n        output_color: [yellow, green, gray, magenta]\n        relation: adjacent to blue square\n    transformation: \"Change adjacent white pixels to yellow; leave other colors unchanged\"\n    result: match\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify** the blue (1) square object in the input grid, located at the center.\n2.  **Locate** all pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, right - not diagonally) to the blue square.\n3.  **Change** the color of adjacent pixels that are white (0) to yellow (4).\n4. **Preserve** the color of the blue pixels.\n5. **Preserve** all other pixels, including the outermost layer of the grid.\n6.  **Output** the modified grid.\n"
