Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are blue (1), maroon/dark red (9), and white (0). In the output, yellow (4) appears. The transformation seems to involve a change in color surrounding the blue (1) pixels. Specifically, it appears some white (0) pixels and some maroon (9) pixels adjacent to blue are changed to yellow.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - blue (1)
        - maroon (9)
        - yellow (4)
      position: [row, column]
actions:
  - type: color_change
    target: pixel
    from: [white, maroon]
    to: yellow
    condition: adjacent to blue
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side (not diagonal).
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Locate** all pixels that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally) to the blue pixels.
3.  **Change** the color of any adjacent pixels from white (0) or maroon (9) to yellow (4).
4.  **Preserve** the color of the blue pixels and any other pixel not described above.
5.  **Output** the modified grid.
