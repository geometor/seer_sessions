The primary colors involved are blue (1), maroon/dark red (9), and white (0). In the output, yellow (4) appears. The transformation seems to involve a change in color surrounding the blue (1) pixels. Specifically, it appears some white (0) pixels and some maroon (9) pixels adjacent to blue are changed to yellow.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
