Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against all the training examples and formulate a revised natural language program and supporting information.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, focusing on object identification and adjacency-based expansion. However, the results across multiple training examples reveal that the logic is incomplete and needs refinement. The core issue is that the original logic only considers expanding *into* azure (8) pixels, it does not understand how expansion occurs correctly. It also incorrectly handles multiple object interactions. We need to correct directionality of the propogation.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** For each example, meticulously compare the expected output with the actual output of the `transform` function. Identify precisely which pixels are incorrect and why.
2.  **Object Interaction:** Pay close attention to how different colored objects interact, especially when multiple objects are adjacent to azure.
3.  **Directionality:**  The current logic assumes a bidirectional expansion, which is not always the case. Determine the rules governing the direction of color propagation.
4. **Revised YAML and natural language program:** Incorporate observations to create a complete and accurate transformation rule.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To gather metrics, I will use the provided `code_execution` tool to compare each input, expected output, and actual output from the current `transform` function.

Here is the general format I will use for the report:

```
Example: [example number]
Input Shape: [rows, cols]
Expected Output Shape: [rows, cols]
Actual Output Shape: [rows, cols]
Pixel Accuracy: [percentage of correctly predicted pixels]
Incorrect Pixels: [(row, col, expected_color, actual_color), ...]
```
```tool_code
def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:
        return {
            'equal': False,
            'accuracy': 0,
            'incorrect_pixels': []
        }
    else:
        comparison = grid1 == grid2
        equal = np.all(comparison)
        accuracy = np.sum(comparison) / grid1.size if grid1.size >0 else 0
        incorrect_pixels = []
        if not equal:
            indices = np.where(comparison == False)
            for i in range(len(indices[0])):
                row = indices[0][i]
                col = indices[1][i]
                incorrect_pixels.append((row, col, int(grid2[row, col]), int(grid1[row,col])))

        return {
            'equal': equal,
            'accuracy': round(accuracy,4),
            'incorrect_pixels': incorrect_pixels
        }

results = []
for i, example in enumerate(task_data['train']):
    input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
    expected_output = np.array(example['output'])
    actual_output = transform(input_grid)
    comparison_results = compare_grids(actual_output, expected_output)
    results.append({
        'example': i,
        'input_shape': input_grid.shape,
        'expected_output_shape': expected_output.shape,
        'actual_output_shape': actual_output.shape,
        'accuracy': comparison_results['accuracy'],
        'incorrect_pixels': comparison_results['incorrect_pixels']
    })
print(results)
```
