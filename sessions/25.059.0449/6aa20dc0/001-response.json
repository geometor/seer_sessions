The transformation seems to involve identifying connected regions (objects) of the same color and potentially modifying, moving or replicating them, along with a change to existing background. The background appears to consistently change in ways that are predictable, for example all background pixels are the same color. There is some kind of interaction between objects and the background.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"

The relative position is maintained if the shape expands, or if the color is changed.\n\nLet's look at the transformations with more specifics, example by example:\n    *  **Example 1**:\n       - Input background is blue (1). Output background is blue(1).\n       - The red (2) object expands to include an additional row of azure (8) pixels to the immediate right of the existing red object.\n       - The green (3) object expands to include an additional row of azure (8) pixels to the immediate left of the existing green object.\n       - The 2x1 azure (8) block on the left changes color to 2 x 2 azure (8).\n    * **Example 2**:\n       - Input background is yellow (4). Output background is yellow (4)\n       - The small complex in the upper left consisting of blue (1), magenta(6) and red (2) pixels stays the same.\n       - The existing Red (2) 3x1 cluster expands one unit to the left, to make a Red(2) 3x2 block.\n       - The existing Magenta (6) 3x1 cluster expands one unit to the left, to make a Magenta (6) 3x2 block.\n   * **Example 3**:\n      - Input background is azure(8). Output background is azure (8).\n      - Yellow, red and green clusters all get re-colored to green(3), red(2), yellow (4) (i.e. no changes). The 1x2 cluster of green (3) expands by one unit to the left, making it 2x2.\n      - The other clusters have their locations maintained.\n"
