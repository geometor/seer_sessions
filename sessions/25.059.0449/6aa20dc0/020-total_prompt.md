Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all connected components (clusters) of non-azure (8) colored pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Analyze Colored Pixels:** For each identified cluster, record the original positions of the colored pixels.

3.  **Replicate and Shift:**
     For each non-azure pixel in the original figure:
          Replicate that pixel, along with all non-azure pixels below and to the
		  right of that pixel in the input figure, in a new position, shifted
		  diagonally by a specific amount relative to its position in the original image. Specifically the
		  shift is down and to the right, and the amount is based on the original position
		  of the pixel in the original cluster in the input image.

4.  **Preserve Background:**  All azure (8) pixels in the input grid that are not replaced by the replicated objects remain unchanged in the output grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. The results on subsequent examples reveal some inaccuracies:

1.  The description correctly identified the downward and rightward shift.
2.  The relationship between shift and original position wasn't precise, causing both under- and over-shifting.
3.  The replication of pixels below and to the right, only, of the current pixel
    is incomplete.

The strategy to address these issues is as follows:

1.  **Refine Shift Calculation:** Carefully re-examine the relationship between the original pixel positions and their new positions in *all* training examples. Look specifically for a consistent mathematical relationship.
2.  **Correct Replication**: Review the definition of replication to ensure that all intended pixels will be copied.

**Metrics and Observations**

I'll use `code_execution` to confirm dimensions and other specific characteristics.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - task: 5f2f8664
  - objects:
    - description: Connected components of non-azure pixels.
      properties:
        - color: Varies (not azure).
        - shape: Varies.
        - size: Varies.
  - actions:
    - description: The object's pixels are replicated and shifted.
      details:
        - shift:  Pixels move diagonally down and to the right.
        - amount: The initial x and y of each pixel determines its position,
                the entire object is replicated relative to the starting pixel's
                initial x and y.
        - replication: includes all non-azure pixels.
  - background:
      color: azure (8)

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all connected regions (objects) of non-azure (8) colored pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Replicate and Shift:** For each object, replicate the entire object multiple times. Each non-azure pixel within the object serves as an "origin" for one of these replications.
3.  **Shifting Rule:** The new position of each replicated object is determined by the initial row and column of the origin pixel used for that replication. Specifically, each pixel (r, c) of the *entire replicated object* is placed at a new location (r + origin_row, c + origin_col), where (origin_row, origin_col) is the position of the "origin" pixel within the original input grid.
4.  **Background Preservation:** Any azure (8) pixels in the input grid that are not overwritten by the replicated object remain unchanged in the output grid.

The critical change is understanding that the ENTIRE object is replicated for EACH non-azure pixel it contains, and the shift of that replicated object is based on the initial coordinates of the origin pixel used for THAT specific replication. The previous version incorrectly limited the replication to pixels below and to the right of the current pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
