There are isolated \"objects\" composed of connected pixels of colors other than azure. These objects appear to be the focus of the transformation. The transformation seems to involve some kind of replication or propagation of these non-azure colored objects, possibly with a change in their arrangement and relative positions. The azure background remains largely unchanged, except where replaced by the replicated objects.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
