objects:
  - id: blue_shape
    color: blue
    type: dynamic  # Because its final shape depends on others
    initial_shape: L-shape # In most cases, but it varies
    behavior: expands_and_fills

actions:
  - name: combine_and_expand
    target: blue_shape
    description: >
      The blue shape's bounding box expands to include the bounding boxes
      of the red and magenta squares, plus a one-pixel border.
  - name: modified_fill
    target: blue_shape
    description: >
       The expanded bounding box is filled with blue, and then filtered using a gravity rule. If a blue
      pixel does not lie directly below another one, it reverts to background.
  - name: overlay
    target: red_square, magenta_square
    description: The red and magenta squares are overlaid on the blue shape, maintaining their original positions and sizes.
  - name: column_filter
    target: blue_shape
    description: >
        The blue shape is then filtered to keep only columns that are either original or fully adjacent to another column that has a count of greater than one blue.
