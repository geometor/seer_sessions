Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the blue L-shape, the red square, and the magenta square in the input grid. Note their colors, positions, and dimensions. Note the areas covered by all of them.

2.  **Combine and fill a new shape:** Create an expanded shape that combines all of the objects in the input. Use the blue (1) color to perform fills.

3. **Fill Red:** Fill a red square using the original position and extent.
4. **Fill Magenta:** Fill a magenta square using the original position and extend.

5.  **Background:** The rest of the grid remains yellow (4).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
