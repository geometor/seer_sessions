The primary colors observed are blue (1), red (2), green (3), and azure (8). There appear to be distinct \"objects\" formed by contiguous blocks of the same color (other than blue, which seems to act as a background). The transformation seems to involve some interaction between the objects, specifically expansion and/or color changes.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
