The primary colors involved seem to be yellow (4), red (2), and blue (1). The background is white (0). The transformation appears to involve a rearrangement and potentially a deletion of some of these colored rectangles. Specifically, it seems like the positions and shapes of the rectangles change between the input and output, with some disappearing. The yellow rectangle appears to reduce in height, the red and blue move position and shrink\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
