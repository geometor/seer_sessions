The input grid transforms into a different output grid. The primary visual elements are colored rectangular blocks. The colors present are white (0), blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4). The positions and potentially the sizes of these colored blocks change between the input and output. Some rows/parts of the colored areas disappear.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
