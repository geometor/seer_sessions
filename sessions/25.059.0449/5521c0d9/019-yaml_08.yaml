- objects:
    - color: blue (1)
      shape: single pixel
      initial_position: variable
      movement: shift up 4 rows
    - color: yellow (4)
      shape: variable, can be multiple connected pixels
      initial_position: variable
      movement: shift up 2 rows
    - color: red (2)
      shape: variable, can be multiple connected pixels.  In examples, it is always a contiguous line.
      initial_position: variable
      movement: shift up 1 row
- context:
    - description: The colored objects move together, as a unit
    - relative_position: The relative positions of the colored pixels to each other are maintained.
    - boundary: The objects shift upwards within the grid boundaries.
    - combined_object: the set of blue, yellow and red pixels should be considered as a single object with internal relationships that must be maintained
