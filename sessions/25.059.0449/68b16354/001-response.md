Okay, I've reviewed the provided input-output pairs. Here's my analysis:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers, where each integer represents a color. The transformation appears to be a spatial manipulation of the grid rather than a change in the colors themselves. The size of grids also appear to be the same. It seems like simple row reversal.

**Facts (YAML):**



```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
transformation_type: spatial
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns
      - elements: integers (representing colors)
actions:
  - name: reverse_rows
    description: The order of rows in the grid is reversed.
relationships:
  - input_grid is transformed to output_grid by reversing_rows
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to reverse the order of the rows in the input grid. The first row becomes the last, the second row becomes the second-to-last, and so on, until the last row becomes the first. The columns are kept the same.

Essentially, the output grid is a vertically flipped version of the input grid.
