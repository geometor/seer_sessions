The key colors involved seem to be red (2), green (3), and background/white (0).  The transformation appears to involve a shifting or repositioning of colored blocks, specifically a red block with a green center, or individual occurrences of green. The shapes formed by non-zero pixels are significant.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Also, identify any isolated green (3) pixels or green pixels within the red blocks.\n2.  **Analyze Output Structure**: Observe that connected components are present in both input and output.\n3.  **Shift or Copy Red Block**: In the example given, it appears there is a connected 3x1 region of red color which is not present at the location of the input, but copied to just above it, keeping the green color pixels intact.\n4. **Maintain Green Locations:** Green(3) pixels inside a connected red block are maintained to the relative position after the shift/copy\n5. **Maintain Vertical Order if No Red Block**: If a green block is present outside the connected red block, the relative vertical order of all green pixels should be kept.\n6. **Empty the original block**: After moving the red block, replace those cells with white(0)\n\nIn summary, the core transformation seems to be a structured shift or duplication of connected red block along with green pixels in and out of the red block, while maintaining the relative position of green pixels inside a red block, and empty the original location of the red block.\n\n"
