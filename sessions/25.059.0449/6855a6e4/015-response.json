The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and gray (5).  There are distinct shapes formed by the red and gray pixels. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement or interaction between the red and gray objects. Specifically, the gray pixels in the output appear to occupy a location previously bounded, but not filled, by the red pixels. It also looks like there is a horizontal line of symmetry in both input and output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
