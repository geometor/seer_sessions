Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule takes each azure pixel and expands it into an "L" shape of green pixels to the right and down, stopping when there is no available cell, or they are out of the grid. The red block at the bottom remains unchanged.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_pixels_by_color(grid, color):
    """Finds the coordinates of all pixels of a specific color."""
    return np.argwhere(grid == color).tolist()

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the described rule."""
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    azure_pixels = find_pixels_by_color(input_grid, 8)

    for row, col in azure_pixels:
        # Generate green pixel to the right
        if col + 1 < output_grid.shape[1] and output_grid[row, col + 1] == 0:
            output_grid[row, col + 1] = 3

        # Generate green pixels downwards
        current_row = row + 1
        current_col = col
        
        if current_row < output_grid.shape[0] and output_grid[current_row,current_col ] == 0:
            output_grid[current_row,current_col] = 3

        
        current_col = col +1
        while current_row < output_grid.shape[0] :

            if current_col < output_grid.shape[1] and output_grid[current_row,current_col] == 0:

                output_grid[current_row, current_col] = 3
                current_col +=1
            else:
                break
            current_row += 1
    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were on the right track, focusing on expanding azure pixels. However, the implementation has several issues as demonstrated in the results. The code doesn't always draw to the edge and sometimes expands the "L" shape incorrectly. The red object at the bottom should stay unchanged.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully review each input-output pair, paying close attention to how the azure shapes transform and how the "L" shapes are formed, including their boundaries and interactions.

2.  **Refine Shape Expansion Logic:** The current code attempts a somewhat complex expansion that has proven to be buggy. We need to simplify the logic, perhaps by thinking separately about the rightward and downward expansions or by iterating in a different order and also adding boundary checks.

3. **Ensure no changes of red block.** Make sure that the code does not accidentally change the red object at the bottom.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example and the code execution results:

**Example 0 (Correct):**

*   **Input:** A single azure pixel in the top left corner.
*   **Expected Output:** An "L" shape of green pixels extending to the right and bottom edges.
*   **Actual Output:** Matches the expected output.
*   **Assessment:** The initial code handled this simple case correctly, but did draw over a red object at the bottom.

**Example 1 (Incorrect):**

*   **Input:** A single azure pixel near the top-right.
*   **Expected Output:** A single horizontal green line that begins at the azure,
    and a single veritcal green line that begins at the azure.
*   **Actual Output:** Does draw correctly to the right, but only expands 3 down,
    stopping short of the bottom.

**Example 2 (Incorrect):**

*   **Input:** Two azure pixels, one near the center and another on the right
    edge.
*   **Expected Output:** Two "L" shapes of green, respecting the grid boundaries.
*   **Actual Output:** The center azure creates and L that stop short. The pixel
    at the edge draws a line down that stops short..

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task_id: 25d8a9c8
objects:
  - id: azure_pixels
    color: azure
    description: Source pixels for the transformation.
    initial_positions: Varies in each example.
  - id: green_l_shapes
    color: green
    description: "L" shaped expansions from the azure pixels.
    behavior: Extends right and down from each azure pixel, stopping at grid boundaries.
  - id: red_block
    color: red
    description: a single red block at the bottom of the grid.
    behavior: remains unchanged.
actions:
  - name: expand_l_shape
    input: azure_pixels
    output: green_l_shapes
    description: >-
      For each azure pixel, create a green line to the right, until the edge of
      the grid, and a green line down, until the edge of the grid.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are colored azure.

2.  **Expand Right and Down:** For each azure pixel:

    *   Change one cell to the right of the current azure pixel to green.
    *   Change one cell to the bottom of the current azure pixel to green.
    *   Create green cells from each new green cell to the edges of the grid, to
        the right and down, respectively.

3. **Keep red cells unchanged:** The initial red block at the bottom should be unchanged.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
