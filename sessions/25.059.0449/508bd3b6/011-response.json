            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were on the right track, focusing on expanding azure pixels. However, the implementation has several issues as demonstrated in the results. The code doesn't always draw to the edge and sometimes expands the \"L\" shape incorrectly. The red object at the bottom should stay unchanged.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully review each input-output pair, paying close attention to how the azure shapes transform and how the \"L\" shapes are formed, including their boundaries and interactions.\n\n2.  **Refine Shape Expansion Logic:** The current code attempts a somewhat complex expansion that has proven to be buggy. We need to simplify the logic, perhaps by thinking separately about the rightward and downward expansions or by iterating in a different order and also adding boundary checks.\n\n3. **Ensure no changes of red block.** Make sure that the code does not accidentally change the red object at the bottom.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example and the code execution results:\n\n**Example 0 (Correct):**\n\n*   **Input:** A single azure pixel in the top left corner.\n*   **Expected Output:** An \"L\" shape of green pixels extending to the right and bottom edges.\n*   **Actual Output:** Matches the expected output.\n*   **Assessment:** The initial code handled this simple case correctly, but did draw over a red object at the bottom.\n\n**Example 1 (Incorrect):**\n\n*   **Input:** A single azure pixel near the top-right.\n*   **Expected Output:** A single horizontal green line that begins at the azure,\n    and a single veritcal green line that begins at the azure.\n*   **Actual Output:** Does draw correctly to the right, but only expands 3 down,\n    stopping short of the bottom.\n\n**Example 2 (Incorrect):**\n\n*   **Input:** Two azure pixels, one near the center and another on the right\n    edge.\n*   **Expected Output:** Two \"L\" shapes of green, respecting the grid boundaries.\n*   **Actual Output:** The center azure creates and L that stop short. The pixel\n    at the edge draws a line down that stops short..\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: 25d8a9c8\nobjects:\n  - id: azure_pixels\n    color: azure\n    description: Source pixels for the transformation.\n    initial_positions: Varies in each example.\n  - id: green_l_shapes\n    color: green\n    description: \"L\" shaped expansions from the azure pixels.\n    behavior: Extends right and down from each azure pixel, stopping at grid boundaries.\n  - id: red_block\n    color: red\n    description: a single red block at the bottom of the grid.\n    behavior: remains unchanged.\nactions:\n  - name: expand_l_shape\n    input: azure_pixels\n    output: green_l_shapes\n    description: >-\n      For each azure pixel, create a green line to the right, until the edge of\n      the grid, and a green line down, until the edge of the grid.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are colored azure.\n\n2.  **Expand Right and Down:** For each azure pixel:\n\n    *   Change one cell to the right of the current azure pixel to green.\n    *   Change one cell to the bottom of the current azure pixel to green.\n    *   Create green cells from each new green cell to the edges of the grid, to\n        the right and down, respectively.\n\n3. **Keep red cells unchanged:** The initial red block at the bottom should be unchanged.\n\n"
