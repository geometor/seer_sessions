Both grids are 12x12 and contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors involved seem to be red (2), white (0), azure (8), and green (3).  A significant change is the appearance of green (3) in the output where only white (0) existed in the input, and the azure (8) pixels remain unchanged. The red (2) pixels also remain. It appears as though the green (3) pixels are filling in the upper triangle created if there was a line between each of the blue pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The empty space bounded by the red rectangle to left, above the diagonal azure line, and extending to the top right. Change all white (0) pixels within this bound to green (3).\n\nIn short: \"Change to green all white pixels in a region formed by the left, the top, and a line that would connect the azure pixels.\"\n"
