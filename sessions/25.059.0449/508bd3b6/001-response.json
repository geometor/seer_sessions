The most noticeable changes involve the introduction or shifting of green (3) pixels, while the azure (8) and red (2) pixels mostly remain constant. The white (0) pixels seem to act as a background. It appears that a sequence of green pixels is added, originating from a position relative to the existing azure pixels, extending diagonally upwards and to the left until interrupted by an edge or red object.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
