The input grid contains a diagonal line of azure (8) pixels in the top left, and a large block of red (2) pixels at the bottom. The output grid introduces green (3) pixels, seemingly related to the position of the azure pixels, while maintaining the other elements. The green pixels form an inverse \"L\" shape, expanding down and right from each original azure.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

All other elements stay in place.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule takes each azure pixel and expands it into an \"L\" shape of green pixels to the right and down, stopping when there is no available cell, or they are out of the grid. The red block at the bottom remains unchanged.\n"
