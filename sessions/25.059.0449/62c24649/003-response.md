Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The core of the input grid seems to be replicated and surrounded by a border. The colors (represented by numbers) in the input grid are preserved in the output grid. The border appears to have a specific color based on one of the corner colors of the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**

    output_size: 6x6 # (input_size * 2)
  - type: object
    description: border
    color: top-left pixel of input (3/green in this case)
    thickness: 1 pixel

  - type: replication

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with dimensions double that of the input grid (e.g., if input is 3x3, output is 6x6).

2.  **Copy Input:** Copy the input grid to the center of the output grid. Specifically, the top-left corner of the input grid should start at the cell (1,1) of the output grid.

3.  **Create Border:** Fill the outermost rows and columns of the output grid with the color of the top-left pixel of the *input* grid. This forms a one-pixel-wide border around the replicated input grid.
