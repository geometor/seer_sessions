The core elements appear to be individual colored pixels/cells and their spatial relationships. The transformation seems to involve some form of expansion or replication of the original grid, maintaining the relative positions of the colors. The output grid is significantly larger than the input grid, suggesting a scaling factor. The colors in the input are preserved in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
