Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (6x6). The colors in the original grid seem to be replicated and arranged in a specific pattern in the output grid. The transformation appears to be a form of mirroring or reflection, both horizontally and vertically, creating a symmetrical pattern.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)

properties:
  - symmetry:
    type: boolean
    value: true
  - reflection:
    type: string
    value: "horizontal and vertical"

actions:
 - name: reflect_horizontally
   type: replicate grid content across vertical axis
 - name: reflect_vertically
   type: replicate content across horizontal axis

relationships:
  - input_grid is transformed into output_grid
  - output_grid is a mirrored and expanded version of input_grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Copy** the input grid.
2. **Reflect** the input grid horizontally to create a new 3x3 grid to the right of the original.
3. **Combine** the original and the reflected grid, now creating the top half (3x6) of the final grid.
4. **Reflect** this combined 3x6 grid vertically to create the mirrored bottom half.
5. **Combine** the original combined grid with new reflected gird to get the complete output_grid.

In essence, the input grid is mirrored both horizontally and vertically to produce the output grid. The output grid's dimensions are double that of the input grid in both height and width.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
