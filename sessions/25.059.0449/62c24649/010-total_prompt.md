Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The core elements appear to be individual colored pixels/cells and their spatial relationships. The transformation seems to involve some form of expansion or replication of the original grid, maintaining the relative positions of the colors. The output grid is significantly larger than the input grid, suggesting a scaling factor. The colors in the input are preserved in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cells:
        - value: 3 (green)
          location: (0,0)
        - value: 3 (green)
          location: (0,1)
        - value: 1 (blue)
          location: (0,2)
        - value: 1 (blue)
          location: (1,0)
        - value: 3 (green)
          location: (1,1)
        - value: 0 (white)
          location: (1,2)
        - value: 0 (white)
          location: (2,0)
        - value: 2 (red)
          location: (2,1)
        - value: 2 (red)
          location: (2,2)

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 6x6
      - cells:
        - values_correspond_to_input: True # All values present in input also appear in the output.

  - type: transformation
    description: grid expansion
    properties:
      - scaling_factor: 2  # Output dimensions are twice the input dimensions.
      - replication_type: "block"  # Each input pixel becomes a 2x2 block in the output.
      - border: black

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Receive the input grid (3x3).
   - Determine the scaling factor (2). The output is 2 times in both directions.

2. **Expansion:**
   - Create a new, empty output grid with dimensions twice that of the input grid (6x6).

3. **Replication:**
     - Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
     - For each cell, replicate its color value into a 2x2 block of cells in the corresponding position of the output grid.
     - For input cell (i, j), the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid starts at cell (2i, 2j).

4. **Final Output:** Return the populated 6x6 output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
