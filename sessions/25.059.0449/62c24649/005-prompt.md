Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is expanded to double its original dimensions. The original grid is then copied
into the center of the expanded grid. A border, one pixel wide, is created around the copied
grid. The color of this border is the same as the color of the top-left pixel of the original input grid.
"""

    # Get dimensions of input grid
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape

    # Create output grid with double the dimensions
    output_height = input_height * 2
    output_width = input_width * 2
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # Determine border color (top-left pixel of input)
    border_color = input_grid[0, 0]

    output_grid[0, :] = border_color  # Top row
    output_grid[-1, :] = border_color # Bottom row

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
