observations:
  - task_description: |
      The task involves expanding a given input grid by a factor of two in both dimensions.
      Each pixel in the input grid is replicated as a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
  - object_types:
      - input_grid: A 2D array of integers representing pixel colors.
      - output_grid: A 2D array of integers, double the size of the input grid, with each input pixel expanded.
  - object_properties:
      - pixel_color: Integer value (0-9) representing the color of a pixel.
      - grid_dimensions: The height and width of the grid.
  - actions:
      - pixel_replication: Each pixel in the input is replicated into a 2x2 block in the output.
      - grid_expansion: The output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions.
  - constraints:
      - output_size: The output grid must be exactly twice the size of the input grid in both height and width.
      - color_preservation: The color of each replicated pixel must match the original pixel.
