The primary difference is the appearance of two yellow (value 4) pixels in the last row of the output grid, which were white (value 0) in the input grid.  The magenta (value 6) pixels seem to play a key role, as the yellow pixels appear in locations that seem related to the positions of the magenta pixels. Specifically, the new yellow pixels are at the bottom of the grid in columns that contain magenta pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
