Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Copy Rows: Copy the first four rows (indices 0-3) of the input grid directly to the output grid.
2. Conditional Replacement: For the last row (index 4) of the output grid, iterate through each column:
    *   If the pixel in the input grid's last row is white (0), check the pixel in the same column of row 2 (index 2) of the input grid.
    *   If the pixel in row 2 is either azure (8) or magenta (6), change the corresponding pixel in the output grid's last row to yellow (4).
    *   Otherwise, keep the pixel in the output grid's last row the same as the input.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
