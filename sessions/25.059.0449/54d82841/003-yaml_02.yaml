facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are 8x8.
  - objects:
      - name: magenta_pixels
        color: magenta (6)
        locations:
          input:  [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 7)]
          output: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 7)] # Same as input
        properties:
          - shape: single pixels
          - static: true  # Positions don't change between input and output
      - name: yellow_pixels
        color: yellow (4)
        locations:
          input:  [] # None in the input
          output: [(7, 2), (7, 6)]
        properties:
          - shape: single pixels
          - static: false # Appear in output
  - relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: |
          Yellow pixels appear in the bottom row (row 7).
          The columns of the yellow pixels (2 and 6) contain magenta pixels in the input grid.
      - type: conditional_appearance
        description: |
            The presence of magenta pixels in a column triggers the change of the bottom-row pixel in that column to yellow.
