The input grids appear to have certain colored regions, and the output grids seem to mostly retain the input structure, but with the addition of a yellow (color 4) object at the bottom. The position of the new yellow object seems related to objects of other colours in the upper rows.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

If there are two or more objects, place two yellow pixels in last row below each object, matching their x position\n\n"
