Okay, here's my attempt at describing the transformation:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Elements:** Locate all instances of the digit '8' in the input grid.

2.  **Conditional Replacement:** For every '8', check to see if it exists at the border, for every border it does NOT exist at replace with digit '1'.

**Explanation of the Logic:**

The core of the transformation seems to be based on the following concept to search every number 8 in the grid:

*   If the number 8 is not next to the border, then replace that instance with number 1.

**Example Application (to Input):**

*   In the provided example input, We see six '8's in the Input grid.
*    Only two '8' digits are surrounded, from the left, right, up, and down borders.
*   The transformation changes the numbers 8 that meet the rules described before to number 1.
