The logic of replacing '8' with '1' when it is *not* on a border still holds true.\n\nTo reiterate:\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Key Elements:** Find all occurrences of the digit '8' within the input grid.\n2.  **Conditional Replacement:** For each identified '8', check if it lies on any of the grid's edges (top, bottom, left, or right). If the '8' is *not* on any edge (i.e., it's an \"inner\" 8), replace it with the digit '1'.\n\nThe provided code already implements this logic correctly.  It iterates through the grid, identifies '8's, and checks their position against the grid boundaries before performing the replacement.  Therefore, I'm confident that the existing solution is accurate and complete.\n"
