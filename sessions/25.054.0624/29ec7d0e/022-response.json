The non-white pixels retain their positions relative to each other and to the overall grid boundaries. The output grid has the exact same shape (height and width) as the input grid. Essentially, white pixels act as \"empty\" space that doesn't affect the layout of the other colored pixels, and is removed without altering the grid structure.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Find the indices of all white (0) pixels.\n    white_indices = np.where(output_grid == 0)\n\n    # Set all white pixels to -1 to visually remove them, while keeping grid dimensions.\n    output_grid[white_indices] = -1  # Use -1 as a placeholder\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
