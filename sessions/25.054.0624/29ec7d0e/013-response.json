The primary observation is that a significant portion of the input grid, specifically a central \"block\", is removed in the output. The remaining parts of the grid appear unchanged. The removed block seems to correspond to areas where zeros were present, as well as other colors within that same connected region.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
