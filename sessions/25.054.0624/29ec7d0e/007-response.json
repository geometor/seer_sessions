The most obvious change is the removal of all '0' (white) pixels. The other colored pixels remain in their exact original positions. The overall grid dimensions remain identical. The transformation appears to be a simple filter operation: remove all pixels of a specific color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
