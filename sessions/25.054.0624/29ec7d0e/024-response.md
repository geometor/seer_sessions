"""
The transformation rule is to identify all pixels that are white (color value 0) in the input grid. The output grid has identical dimensions to the input grid. Every cell in the input grid that is not white (0), is unchanged in the output grid. Every cell in the input grid that *is* white (0), is set to white (0) in the output grid. In other words, the output is the same as the input.

    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.  This ensures
    # the dimensions are the same and all non-white pixels are already
    # correctly placed.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Find the indices of all white (0) pixels.  Although the prompt says
    # to remove them, we interpret "remove" in this context as setting those pixels to background.
