Both grids appear to have identical dimensions (18x18) and contain numerical digits (0-5) representing different colors. The primary difference lies in the arrangement and presence of specific digits/colors.  I perceive that some parts of the input grid are removed (white/0).\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
