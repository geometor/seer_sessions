            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program and supporting documentation.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial strategy was partially correct in identifying a 4x4 block and applying a circular shift. However, several key aspects were incorrect:\n\n1.  **Block Identification:** The code attempts to find a \"multicolor\" block, using a heuristic of `len(unique_colors) > 4`. This is not a reliable way to identify the correct block, especially since the block isn't always guaranteed to have more than 4 unique colors. The consistent element across all examples is that the relevant 4x4 block is in the lower-right part of the input grid and contains *all* of the non-background colors. the provided code did not use the `COLOR_MAP` but instead worked directly with the integer values.\n\n2.  **Output Size:** The code always produces a 4x4 output. The expected outputs in examples 1 and 2 are 3x3, and example 3 is 4x4. It seems the size needs to be variable, or some rows are dropped. Let's clarify that.\n\n3. **Shifting:** The code attempts a circular right shift. However, the examples shows different row sizes.\n\n4.  **Zero-Padding:** The transformed output has extra zeros - where do they\n    come from?\n\nThe strategy to resolve these errors will involve:\n\n1.  **Improved Block Detection:** Instead of relying on a \"multicolor\" heuristic, we should identify the 4x4 block based on the presence of all, or most, non-background colors *and* its position near the lower-right.\n\n2.  **Size Determination:** Investigate if rows are dropped.\n\n3.  **Precise Shift Logic:** Examine the input and output pairs more closely to determine the *exact* shifting/rearrangement logic, not just a simple circular shift.\n\n4.  **Review Padding:** Determine the source and reason for zero padding.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on relevant metrics:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 21x22\n    *   Expected Output Size: 3x4\n    *   Transformed Output Size: 4x4\n    *   Colors in 4x4 block (bottom-right): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9\n    *   Unique Colors in Expected Output: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9\n    *   Notes: One row appears to be deleted. The shift logic is a right circular shift.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 27x25\n    *   Expected Output Size: 3x4\n    *   Transformed Output Size: 4x4\n    *   Colors in 4x4 block (bottom-right): 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9\n    *   Unique Colors in Expected Output: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0\n    *   Notes: One row appears to be deleted. The shift logic is a right circular shift.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 22x20\n    *   Expected Output size: 4x4\n    *   Transformed output size: 4x4\n    *   Colors in 4x4 block(bottom-right): 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9\n    *   Unique Colors in Expected output: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9\n    *   Notes: The output size matches. Shift logic is right circular.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_grid_size: [21, 22]\n    output_grid_size: [3, 4]\n    block_colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n    output_colors: [0,2,3,4,6,7,8,9]\n    transformation: circular_shift_right\n    notes: row_dropped\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_grid_size: [27, 25]\n    output_grid_size: [3, 4]\n    block_colors:  [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n    output_colors: [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n    transformation: circular_shift_right\n    notes: row_dropped\n\n  - example_id: 3\n    input_grid_size: [22, 20]\n    output_grid_size: [4, 4]\n    block_colors: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9]\n    output_colors:  [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9]\n    transformation: circular_shift_right\n    notes: \"\"\n\nobjects:\n    - name: input_grid\n      type: grid\n      properties:\n          - rows\n          - cols\n          - cells (2d array of integers)\n    - name: 4x4_block\n      type: grid\n      properties:\n          - rows: 4\n          - cols: 4\n          - location: bottom-right of input_grid\n          - description: contains all/most non-background colors.\n    - name: output_grid\n      type: grid\n      properties:\n          - rows (variable, could be less than 4x4 block)\n          - cols (variable)\n          - cells (modified from 4x4 block)\n\nactions:\n    - name: locate_4x4_block\n      input: input_grid\n      output: 4x4_block\n      description: Finds the 4x4 block near bottom right containing most non-background color values.\n    - name: extract_rows\n      input: 4x4_block\n      output: rows (list of lists)\n    - name: circular_shift\n      input: row (list)\n      output: shifted_row (list)\n      description: Moves the last element to the beginning.\n    - name: drop_row\n      input: list of rows, row number\n      output: list of rows after removal\n    - name: create_output_grid\n      input: list of rows\n      output: output_grid\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Locate 4x4 Block:** Find the 4x4 block of pixels in the lower-right region of the input grid. This block contains all or most of the non-background (non-zero) colors present in the entire input grid. The code will check all 4x4 blocks moving from bottom right up and to the left.\n\n2.  **Extract Rows:** Extract each row of the 4x4 block as a separate list.\n\n3. **Drop Row:** If the first and second rows of the input 4x4 block contain all the same values, and those are the background color, drop the first row.\n\n4.  **Circular Shift Right:** For each extracted row (after potentially dropping one), perform a circular shift to the right. This means moving the last element of the row to the beginning, and shifting all other elements one position to the right.\n\n5.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create the output grid by combining the shifted rows.\n"
