Okay, I'm ready to analyze this example and try to figure out the transformation. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a large grid (22x22) mostly filled with white pixels (0).
*   There's a large, irregular shape made of azure pixels (8) in the center.
*   There's a smaller, dense 4x4 block of multi-colored pixels at the lower right.
*   The output is a smaller grid (4x4) that seems to correspond to the 4x4 multi-colored block in the input, however the last digit of each row in the block is moved to the beginning.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: large_grid
    dimensions: 22x22
    dominant_color: white (0)
  - type: irregular_shape
    color: azure (8)
    location: center
  - type: multi_color_block
    dimensions: 4x4
    location: lower_right
    colors: [4,1,9,4,6,3,6,1,3,5,7,5,2,4,2,7]
  - type: output_grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    colors: derived from multi_color_block

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: The multi-color block is extracted from the input grid.
  - type: circular_shift
    description: moving last element to first position within each row.
    

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate** the 4x4 multi-colored block in the lower right of the input grid.
2.  **Extract** the values from each row from this 4x4 block.
3.  **Circular Shift Right**: For each extracted row, shift the last element of each row and insert to first position.
4.  **Construct** the output grid with these modified rows.

In essence, the program extracts a specific region from the input, then rearranges the elements by rotating each row's to the right, by one.
