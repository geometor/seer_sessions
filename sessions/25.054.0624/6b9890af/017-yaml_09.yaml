    description: The inner rectangle's width is adjusted to fit inside the red rectangle's outline.
    details: >
      The width is calculated as the width of the red rectangle minus 2
      (to account for the left and right borders). The original height should be
      the distance between top of the inner shape and the bottom of the outer
      rectangle, plus 1, including any rows where the inner shape touches
      the outer shape.

  - name: position_inner_rectangle
    description: The inner rectangle is placed just inside the top border of the red rectangle.
    details: >
      The top-left corner of the inner rectangle is placed one row down and one
      column to the right of the red rectangle's top-left corner. If inner shape is positioned
      under the top of red rectangle, the position and height should be adjusted
      accordingly.

  - name: redraw
    description: >
      The output grid is created with the size of the red rectangle's bounding box.
      Both the red rectangle (outline only) and the inner rectangle (filled) are drawn
      onto the output grid, with the inner rectangle positioned and resized as described above.
