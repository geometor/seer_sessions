Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, broken down into perceptions, a YAML fact block, and a natural language program.

**Perception:**

The input is a large grid (18x21) containing two distinct colored objects: a small azure (8) shape in the top-center and a larger red (2) square/frame towards the bottom-center. The output is a smaller grid (8x8) that appears to be a cropped and combined representation of the two objects from the input, overlaid on each other. The red square from the input forms the outer border of the output grid, while the azure shape is placed in the center. Where the colors overlap, the azure (8) takes priority. Areas outside of any colored region in the result remain white (0).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: azure_shape
    color: azure (8)
    type: contiguous_block
    position: top_center, input_grid
    action: cropped, overlayed
  - object: red_square
    color: red (2)
    type: frame/square
    position: bottom_center, input_grid
    action: cropped, overlayed
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 8x8
    relationship: combined_representation, azure_shape, red_square
  - rule: "color_priority: azure (8) > red (2)"
  - rule: cropping_bounds: inferred_from_objects
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the azure (8) contiguous block and the red (2) square/frame within the input grid.
2. **Determine Output Grid Size and Cropping Bounds**: determine cropping bounds to encapsulate both identified objects and resize to 8x8. The cropping boundary in input includes all parts of both shapes.
3.  **Overlay Objects:** Create an 8x8 output grid.
4.  **Draw Red Square:** Copy the pixels of the cropped red square into the output grid, maintaining relative positions.
5.  **Draw Azure Shape:** Copy the pixels of the cropped azure shape into the output grid, maintaining relative positions.
6. **Color Priority:** if there is any pixel with overlapping colors, copy the pixel value of azure shape.
7.  **Background:** Any remaining pixels in the output grid that were not part of either object are set to white (0).

In essence, the program crops the relevant objects from the input grid, overlays them onto a new 8x8 grid with a defined color priority, and sets any remaining background pixels to white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
