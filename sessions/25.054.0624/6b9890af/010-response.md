Okay, let's analyze the provided data and results to refine our understanding of the transformation.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was a simple placeholder, providing basic information about the input, expected output, and a preliminary (incorrect) transformed output. It doesn't perform any actual transformation logic. The provided 'transformed' outputs in the examples are clearly *not* derived from the inputs using any consistent rule, they seem to be simplified or incomplete versions of the *expected* output. We need to ignore the `transformed` field and focus solely on how to correctly map `input` to `expected`.

The core strategy is to:

1. **Identify Objects:** Determine what constitutes an "object" in each input grid. This might be contiguous regions of the same color, or it might have a more complex definition.
2. **Object Properties:** For each object, note its color, size, position, shape, and any other relevant features.
3. **Transformation Rules:** Analyze how these object properties change between the input and output grids.  Look for patterns like:
    *   **Movement:** Do objects move?  If so, in what direction and by how much?
    *   **Color Changes:** Do object colors change? Is there a consistent mapping (e.g., all blues become reds)?
    *   **Size/Shape Changes:**  Do objects grow, shrink, or change shape?
    *   **Creation/Deletion:** Are new objects created? Do any objects disappear?
4. **Prioritize Simplicity:** Start with the simplest possible transformation rules and increase complexity only as needed.

**Metrics and Observations (from `code_execution` results):**
The print statements have been run with the input, expected, and transformed values. Here is a summarized view of what is most valuable:

**Example 1:**

*   `input_colors`: [0, 2, 8]
*   `output_colors`: [0, 2, 8]
*   `transformed_colors`: [0, 2]
*   `input_nonzero_count`: 34
*   `expected_nonzero_count`: 56
*   `transformed_nonzero_count`: 20
*  `output_shape`:(8,8)
*  `transformed_shape`: (5,5)

**Example 2:**

*   `input_colors`: [0, 1, 2]
*   `output_colors`: [0, 1, 2]
*  `transformed_colors`: [0, 1, 2]
*   `input_nonzero_count`: 17
*   `expected_nonzero_count`: 21
*   `transformed_nonzero_count`: 17
*  `output_shape`:(5,5)
*  `transformed_shape`: (5,5)

**Example 3:**

*   `input_colors`: [0, 2, 4]
*   `output_colors`: [0, 2, 4]
*   `transformed_colors`: [0,2]
*   `input_nonzero_count`: 37
*   `expected_nonzero_count`: 77
*   `transformed_nonzero_count`: 20
*   `output_shape`:(11,11)
*   `transformed_shape`: (5,5)

  - example: 1
    input_objects:
      - color: 8 #azure

      - color: 2 # red
        shape: rectangle + vertical line
        position: center-left
        size: 16 # pixels
    output_objects:
      - color: 8
        shape: 2x2 square inside a frame of 2
        position: center of 8x8
        size: 4
      - color: 2
        shape: Frame around azure square
        position: outer edges
        size: calculated by frame
    transformation: |
       The azure L-shape is converted into a 2x2 square and moved.
       The red object is simplified into a frame around the azure, maintaining its relative position.

  - example: 2
    input_objects:
      - color: 2  # red
        shape: rectangle + vertical line
        position: top-left
        size: 11
      - color: 1 # blue
        shape: small L
        position: center
        size: 3
    output_objects:
        - color: 2
          shape: frame
          position: outer edges
          size: calc by frame
        - color: 1
          shape: 2 x 2
          position: center
    transformation: |
      The blue L object in the center becomes a 2x2 square.
      The red object is simplified into a frame, maintaining relative position.
  - example: 3
    input_objects:
      - color: 2 # red
        shape: rectangle + vertical line
        position: top-left
        size: 22 # pixels
      - color: 4  # Yellow
        shape: small L
        position: bottom-right
        size: 3
    output_objects:
      - color: 2
        shape: frame
        size: calc by frame
      - color: 4
        shape: 3 x 3 cross, center empty, surrounded by 4
        position: Center
    transformation: |
       Yellow L object in bottom right becomes 3x3 cross and moved to center. The cross consists of the center pixel removed, and the remaining pixels surrounded by pixels of the same color.
       The red object is simplified into a frame, maintaining its position.

general_transformation: |
  1.  Identify "L-shaped" objects composed of 3 pixels.
  2.  Transform these L-shapes:
      a. If Azure, create a 2x2 Azure square in the center.
      b. If Blue, create a 2x2 Blue square in the center.
      c. If Yellow, create a 3x3 cross where the center pixel is blank (0), and the remaining cross pixels are surrounded by pixels of the same color.
  3. Find large shapes on left, convert to a frame.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify L-Shaped Objects:** Locate all objects in the input grid that consist of exactly three contiguous pixels forming an "L" shape. The color of these objects can be azure (8), blue (1), or yellow (4).

2.  **Transform L-Shapes:**
    *   **Azure (8) L-shape:** Replace the L-shape with a 2x2 square of azure (8) pixels. Position this square in the center of the output grid.
    *   **Blue (1) L-shape:** Replace the L-shape with a 2x2 square of blue (1) pixels. Position this square in the center of the output grid.
    *    **Yellow (4) L-shape:** Replace the L-shape with a 3 x 3 cross. The cross consists of the center pixel removed (color 0), and the remaining pixels surrounded by pixels of the same color. Move this to the center of the grid.

3. **Frame Creation:** Identify the largest, non-L shaped colored object on the left side of the input. Simplify this to a rectangular frame of the same color, that is 1 pixel wide along the edges of the output grid. If the output grid is not square, it will match the dimensions of the largest non-L shaped object.

4. The background (0) of the output is not explicitly defined by a rule, other than filling the output grid.

The "transformed" data given in the prompt should be ignored as it is not a valid transformation of the input data.  It's a partial/modified version of the *expected* output, used out of context here.
