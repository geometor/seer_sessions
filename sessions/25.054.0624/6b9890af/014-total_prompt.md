Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain numerical values representing colors. The input grid appears to have two distinct rectangular shapes, one outlined in red (value 2) and another smaller shape in yellow (value 4). The output grid seems to be a condensed and modified version of the input, retaining elements of both shapes. The output is significantly smaller than the input. Specifically, it appears to be made of just the outlines of a rectangle.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: large_rectangle
    color: red (2)
    shape: rectangle
    attribute: outline
    relation: surrounds_smaller_shape
  - object: small_rectangle
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: rectangle
    attribute: filled
    relation: inside_large_rectangle
  - action: combine_outlines
    input_objects: [large_rectangle, small_rectangle]
    output_object: combined_rectangle
    description: "Combines relative positions of the rectangles in the input and incorporates parts of their outline and fill"
  - transformation: size_reduction
    description: The output grid is smaller than input grid.
  - transformation: outline_preservation
    description: "the final red outline shape is preserved"
  - transformation: relative_position
    description: "the small yellow shape moves to be just inside the upper border of the large red outline"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Shapes:** Locate the large red (2) rectangular outline and the smaller, filled yellow (4) rectangle within the input grid.
2.  **Extract Coordinates:** Get the y and x coordinates of both shapes
3. **Create an empty output grid** using the coordinates to create bounding dimensions
4. **Draw Outer Outline:** preserve the large rectangle, scaling to output grid
5.  **Draw Inner Shape:** Place copies the smaller yellow rectangle into the new grid such that it is just inside the top outline of the large shape.
6. **Fill**: preserve the existing fill of the small shape

In essence, the transformation takes the outline of the larger shape, and combines the smaller inside shape inside its top border, while significantly reducing the overall size.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
