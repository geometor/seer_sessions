"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, identify distinct colored regions. In this example, we see a hollow red rectangle (object_1) and a filled blue rectangle (object_2).

2.  **Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest bounding box that can encompass both of the identified colored regions.

3.  **Create Output grid:** Create a 5x5 grid

4.  **Fill Outside with Red:** Fill the perimeter (outermost rows and columns) of this 5 x 5 with Red (2).

5. **Fill Interior with object_2, if present**
    *  check the object in the input
    *  If a filled shape of color other than red exists inside of the bounding box, add 2 units of this color inside of the Red border
    *  These are placed, horizontally centered, at row, column locations: (1,2)(1,3) and (3,2)(3,3)

6.  **Fill remaining with white** Add a White (0) in the one cell inside the Red (2) border and Blue(1) infill

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
