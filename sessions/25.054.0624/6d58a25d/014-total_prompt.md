Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid:** The input and output are both 20x20 grids.
*   **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), green (3), and yellow (4).
*   **Shapes:** There are isolated green (3) pixels scattered throughout the grid. There's a cluster of yellow (4) pixels forming a distinct shape in the input.
*   **Transformation:** The yellow (4) shape seems to be replaced by green (3) pixels, and green pixels are propogated throughout.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 20x20
    elements: pixels
  - type: pixel
    colors:
      - white (0)
      - green (3)
      - yellow (4)
  - type: shape
    color: yellow (4)
    description: A contiguous block of yellow pixels.
  - type: scattered_pixels
    color: green (3)
    description: Individual green pixels not part of any larger shape.

actions:
  - type: replace
    target: yellow shape
    replacement: green pixels
  - type: fill
    color: green
    pattern: all empty cells are filled and existing greens stay

relationships:
  - yellow_shape: adjacent_to, green_pixels
  - green_shape: replaces yellow_shape

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels.
2.  **Identify** the contiguous yellow (4) shape.
3.  **Locate** the position the yellow shape.
4.  **Replace** the yellow (4) shape with green (3)
5.  **Fill** all of the empty (white, 0) cells with green (3) pixels.
6. Existing Green (3) pixels remain unchanged.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
