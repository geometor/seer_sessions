These digits correspond to different colors. The transformation seems to involve modifying the existing pixels, primarily focusing on the azure (8) and maroon (9) pixels. The white (0) pixels appear to act as a background. The transformation appears to primarily involve adding more of a color (azure) that is already present, in places where another color (maroon) is present.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
