The input and output grids have the same dimensions (20x20).  The primary colors present are white (0), red (2), and orange (7). There are distinct clusters or \"objects\" formed by contiguous pixels of the same color. The transformation seems to involve primarily the red (2) pixels.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

Consider the orange pixels as a single object.\n2.  **Horizontal Replication**: For every isolated red pixel not touching or adjacent to an orange pixel, create a duplicate red pixel immediately to its right.\n3.  **Vertical Expansion Based on Orange:** For every column that contains any part of the orange object, perform the following:\n    *   Find all of the existing red pixels from horizontal replication.\n    *   Fill every empty cell in that column between the minimum y coordinate to the maximum y coordinate containing existing red pixels from previous step.\n\nIn summary, red pixels that do not touch orange pixels are replicated, and the orange object acts defines vertical \"zones\" where existing red pixels will define the bounds for red pixels.\n"
