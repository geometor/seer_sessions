            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another grid of the same dimensions. The input grid appears mostly empty (filled with 0s, or white), with a few isolated, single-pixel colored objects. The output grid seems to expand, or \"extrude\", these colored objects, primarily horizontally, creating lines of the same color. The extrusion isn't uniform; it seems related to the presence of other colored pixels in the general area, possibly creating a kind of repeating, alternating pattern. It also looks like the color '3'(green) is repeated vertically as well.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These are the \"seed\" pixels.\n\n2. **Horizontal Extension/Repetition:** For each seed pixel:\n    a. Extend the pixel's color horizontally to the left and right. The pattern alternates between the colors in a row.\n    b. The extension length seems to extend to the edges of the input grid, or where the 0 value is encountered.\n    c.

It is as though the seed pixels' colors have \"bled\" outwards, primarily horizontally but also vertically for color '3'(green).\n\nIn essence the logic appears to replicate the non-zero colors in a cross pattern. horizontally for all non-zero colors, and vertically for the color green (3).\n"
