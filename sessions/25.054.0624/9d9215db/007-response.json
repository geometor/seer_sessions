The most prominent change is the replication of certain colored pixels (blue, yellow, and green) in a specific pattern. The white pixels (0) seem to act as a background. The replication appears to be influenced by existing colored pixels, suggesting a kind of \"expansion\" or \"mirroring\" based on initial positions. The most significant feature appears to be a horizontal line, created by blue, that is extended both horizontally and vertically.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

For each yellow pixel (4), mirror vertically across the center row.\n\n3. **Expand Blue Pixels:**\n    - Find horizontal distance from the line of blue pixels to edge of grid, on each side.\n    - Create horizontal and vertical lines of blue pixels expanding out, using the distance.\n    - Yellow and Green pixels in output from step 2 acts as barriers for blue pixel replication, blue will stop.\n\nIn summary, the transformation involves mirroring green/yellow pixels vertically and replicating blue pixels based on distance of blue pixels, limited by other colors.\n"
