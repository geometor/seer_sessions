Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a color value other than 0 (white). These are the "seed" pixels.

2. **Horizontal Extension/Repetition:** For each seed pixel:
    a. Extend the pixel's color horizontally to the left and right. The pattern alternates between the colors in a row.
    b. The extension length seems to extend to the edges of the input grid, or where the 0 value is encountered.
    c. A minimum length of one unit to the left and the right

3. **Vertical Extension:** The color '3' green expands to fill the height of the grid in its original column

4. **Result:** The output grid is formed by combining these horizontal and vertical expansions. It is as though the seed pixels' colors have "bled" outwards, primarily horizontally but also vertically for color '3'(green).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
