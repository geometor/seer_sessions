There are distinct horizontal lines of azure pixels and vertical lines of azure pixels, creating a grid-like pattern. Within some of the grid \"cells\" formed by the azure lines, there are single pixels of blue (1) and red (2). The output is a much smaller 3x3 grid containing only white (0), blue (1), and red (2) pixels. The positions of the 1 and 2 in the output grid seem to correspond to the relative positions of those colored pixels within a repeating sub-pattern in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Each 3x3 section has the same pattern of the azure lines.\n\n2. **Focus on Non-Azure colors.** Within each 3x3 section the colored pixels (1s and 2s) are of interest.\n\n3.  **Create Output:** Generate the 3x3 output grid.\n\n4.  **Map Colors:** Each cell in the 3x3 section maps directly to the corresponding location.\n    - The blue (1) and red (2) pixels that may appear in the input sections are preserved in the output grid.\n    - Azure is a background and gets dropped and replaced with white(0) in the output grid.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts a representative 3x3 sub-grid from the larger input grid, preserving the relative positions and colors of the non-azure pixels (blue and red), replacing all the other pixels, including azure with white.\n"
