1. **Identify and Isolate:** Scan the input grid and identify all pixels that are *not* green (3) or white (0). In this case, find the red (2) and azure (8) pixels.
2. **Extreme Down-sampling:** Create a new, much smaller 3x3 grid.
3. **Map and reconstruct (condense):** Place the identified non-green, non-white colors (red and azure) into the new grid, maintaining approximate relative positioning from input. The other cells are filled with white (0). Because the grid has been reduced, the location is based on groups of 9 input cells.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of identifying non-background pixels (not green or white) and mapping them to a 3x3 grid based on integer division of their coordinates was partially correct in concept. However, it's clear that the simple coordinate division (`// (input_grid.shape[0] // 3)`) doesn't accurately capture the intended positioning logic, and it also appears to be very sensitive to the contents of each row. The generated outputs often have incorrect colors and positions, especially when multiple different colors are present, or when colors expected in the output, are located near a background color in the input.

The core issue seems to be that the code doesn't properly consider *objectness* or grouping. It treats each non-background pixel independently, rather than recognizing them as parts of potentially larger, meaningful shapes. The integer division approach is also too rigid; it divides the input grid into 9 fixed regions and maps pixels within those regions to the output grid, which isn't always the intended behavior and causes a misalignment of pixels.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Improve Object Recognition:** Instead of treating each pixel individually, we should identify contiguous regions of the same color (objects).
2.  **Refine Mapping Logic:** The mapping to the 3x3 grid should be based on the *centroids* or bounding boxes of these objects, not just individual pixel coordinates.
3.  **Prioritize Non-Background Colors:** Use a strategy that correctly identifies and places non-background colors.
4. **Handle different grid sizes** use a consistent method to reduce to the 3x3 grid

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, along with some observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Size: 29x29
    *   Expected Output Size: 3x3
    *   Colors in Input: 0 (white), 1 (blue), 3 (green), 4 (yellow)
    *   Colors in Expected Output: 0 (white), 1 (blue), 3 (green)
    *   Observations: The code places the blue (1) correctly in the top left and also puts a yellow (4) and incorrectly changes the color to the top. The positioning is off, which is expected as mentioned before.
    *   Identified Error: mapping is pulling in the wrong values, not just location

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Size: 27x27
    *   Expected Output Size: 3x3
    *   Colors in Input: 0 (white), 2 (red), 3 (green), 8 (azure)
    *   Colors in Expected Output: 0 (white), 2 (red), 8 (azure)
    *   Observations: The code identifies red (2) and azure (8), but their relative positions and order aren't entirely correct.
    *   Identified Error: location and ordering

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Size: 29x29
    *   Expected Output Size: 3x3
    *   Colors in Input: 0 (white), 1 (blue), 3 (green), 6 (magenta)
    *   Colors in Expected Output: 0, 3, 6
    *   Observations: Fails to identify non-background colors.
    *   Identified Error: all values incorrect

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input Size: 27x27
    *   Expected Output Size: 3x3
    *   Colors in Input: 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 8 (azure)
    *   Colors in Expected Output: 1, 2, 0
    *   Observations: Output is all azure (8), which is present in the input, but not in the expected output.
    *   Identified Error: all values incorrect, ordering

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_objects:
      - color: 4  # Yellow
        shape: Vertical lines and large block
      - color: 1  # Blue
        shape: Scattered pixels within the yellow block
      - color: 3  # Green
        shape: Scattered pixels within the yellow block
    output_objects:
      - color: 1
        relative_position: top-left
      - color: 3
        relative_position: top-right
    transformation: Downsample to 3x3, preserve relative positions of non-white colors.
    notes: The output seems to pick specific non-white and non-background colors, and place some of them in the top row.

  - example_id: 2
    input_objects:
      - color: 3  # Green
        shape: Vertical lines and background fill
      - color: 2  # Red
        shape: Scattered pixels within green areas
      - color: 8  # Azure
        shape: Scattered pixels within green areas
    output_objects:
      - color: 2  # red
        relative_position: top-center and middle-left
      - color: 8
        relative_position: bottom-right
    transformation: Downsample to 3x3, focus on red and azure.
    notes: output contains correct color.

  - example_id: 3
    input_objects:
      - color: 1
        shape: Vertical Lines
      - color: 6
        shape: Isolated pixels
      - color: 3
        shape: isolated pixels
    output_objects:
      - color: 6
        relative_position: top row
      - color: 3
        relative_position: bottom row
    transformation: Downsample to 3x3 grid focusing on colors 3 and 6. The top row contains 6s, and the bottom row contains 3s. The middle row is all white (0).
    notes: output is not just positioning of the objects, but entire rows of the output are a single color

  - example_id: 4
    input_objects:
     - color: 8
       shape: Vertical Lines, background
     - color: 1
       shape: scattered pixels
     - color: 2
       shape: scattered pixels
    output_objects:
      - color: 1
        relative_position: Top-left
      - color: 2
        relative_position: all other positions
    transformation: Downsample to a 3x3. Colors 1 and 2 are present, with color 2 taking the most area.
    notes: output is not just positioning of the objects, but entire rows of the output are a single color

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Background:** The background color appears to consistently be white (0).
2.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of non-white colors.
3.  **Downsample:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
4.  **Select Colors:** The non-white colors present in the *output* appear to be a subset of those in the input, but there's no simple rule based on individual pixels. It's more like a *selection* of the most prominent or relevant colors, based on some criteria, we haven't fully captured (likely their overall size/area and potentially their grouping or interaction with other objects). Prioritize non-background colors based on this selection, although the exact prioritization method is yet to be determined.
5.  **Map Objects by Row:** The arrangement in the 3x3 grid doesn't strictly follow centroid positions. Instead it appears that entire rows of the input grid, after removing background colored pixels, contribute a single color to one row of the output grid.
6. **Fill Output Grid** the selected colors are placed in the output, filling rows, using a process to be discovered.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
