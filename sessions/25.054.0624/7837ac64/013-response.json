There are horizontal lines of solid blue (1) pixels separating groups of these stripes. Within some of these striped sections, there are horizontal lines of a single different-colored pixel: magenta (6) or green (3). The output is a much smaller 3x3 grid containing only the colors magenta (6), white/background (0), and green (3). The output grid seems to summarize or represent only specific colors present, and those colors are other than the dominant alternating blue/white striped background\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Focus only on colors that \"interrupt\" the striped pattern within a section, specifically magenta (6) and green (3).\n2. **Create Output Grid:** Construct a 3x3 grid.\n3. **Populate Output Grid:** Scan for rows with highlighted colors in input.\n   - For each highlight color in the input grid that exists\n   - Add that color to the output\n   - Fill the rest with '0'\n4. The result will be a compressed representation with the highlighted colors.\n\nIn essence, the program extracts and represents specific \"highlighted\" colors present in more complex patterned input grid.\n"
