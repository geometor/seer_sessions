The output is a much smaller 3x3 grid containing only blue (1), white (0), and green (3). The output seems to be a highly abstracted representation of the input, focusing on a very specific subset of colors and possibly their relative positioning. It is as if, the output grid is summarizing key color features in the source.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
