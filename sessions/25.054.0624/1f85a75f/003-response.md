Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to find a 3x3 green square and create a 5x3 output filled with green, bordered by white.  The first example failed because the position of the green block was not at the very bottom of the input grid (it was in the middle), and because the expected output included a white border *around* the green square in specific configuration. The second example failed because the target 3x3 block was yellow (color 4), not green (color 3) and the expected shape was 3x3, not 5x3.  This indicates the program needs to be more flexible and adapt to different colors and potentially different output sizes, and to correctly locate and extract the target shape. The program strategy should shift from looking for *only* a green square to identifying a 3x3 square of *any* single color, and the output generation should include the correct border.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Generalize Color:** Modify the code to identify a 3x3 square of *any* uniform color, not just green.
2.  **Dynamic Output Size:** Calculate the size of the region around the 3x3 region.
3. **Border Generation**: Generate the correct white border, and fill the inside with the identified color.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including observations:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** 30x30 grid with various colors. A 3x3 green square is present, but not at the edge.
*   **Expected Output:** A 5x3 grid representing a selected section of green values.
*   **Actual Output:** 5x3 grid all zeros
*   **Observations:**
    *   The green square is located at row 11, column 17.
    * The correct output contains a white border on the top and bottom rows.
    *  The white border rows extend one pixel beyond the green on either side.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** 30x30 grid with various colors. A 3x3 yellow square is present.
*   **Expected Output:** A 3x3 grid, all yellow
*   **Actual Output:** 5x3 grid, all zeros.
*   **Observations:**
    *   The yellow square is at row 10, column 11
    *  There is no border around the 3x3 block in the correct output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    target_object:
      shape: square
      size: 3x3
      color: green
      location:
          row: 11
          col: 17
    output:
      shape: rectangle
      size: 5x3
      border:
          color: white
          rows: [top, bottom]
          cols: [all]
      fill:
          color: green

  - example_id: 2
    target_object:
      shape: square
      size: 3x3
      color: yellow
      location:
        row: 10
        col: 11
    output:
      shape: square
      size: 3x3
      fill:
          color: yellow
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Object:** Find a contiguous 3x3 block of pixels that all have the same color (any color) within the input grid. Record the color and the top-left coordinates of this block.
2. **Determine Output Size** If a 3x3 block is not found, return a 1x1 grid of 0. If it is found, and has a border of white above and below, return 5 x 3. If it is found and does not have a border, return 3x3.
3.  **Extract Target Object:** Create an output grid based on determined size.
4. **Case 1: No border** 3x3 found, no white border above and below.
    - Fill output grid with the color of the target object.
5. **Case 2: Border** 3x3 found, white border above and below:
   -   Fill the output grid with white (0).
   -   Replace the inner 3x3 portion of the output (rows 1 to 3 and all columns) with the identified color from step 1.
6. Return the output grid.
