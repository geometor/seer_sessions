The input grid contains scattered pixels of different colors (primarily red/color 2, with a small patch of yellow/color 4). The output grid appears to be a condensed representation, focusing on the yellow (color 4) region. The output is always a 3x3 grid in this example.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
