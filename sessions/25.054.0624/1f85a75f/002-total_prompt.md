**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input is a large, complex grid (30x30) containing various colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9). The output is a much smaller grid (5x3) containing only the colors green (3) and white (0).  The output seems to be a highly abstracted representation of a specific feature within the input.  The input contains many instances of colors 1 (blue), and 5 (gray). It contains several green pixels(3), but the output is all greens and whites. It looks like the green square from input is the only data that matters for the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 30x30
    elements: pixels
    colors: [0, 1, 3, 5]  # Observed colors
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x3
    elements: pixels
    colors: [0, 3] # Observed colors
  - object: green_square
    type: shape
    color: 3
    location: input_grid #can be more specific like coordinates after analyzing the input grid
    relation_to_output: "appears to be the source data for output"
  - action: extraction
    description: "A specific region/pattern in input is isolated"
  - action: transformation
    description: output contains extracted data from the input

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Object:** Locate the contiguous 3x3 block of green (value '3') pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Extract the green square:** Isolate the 3x3 green square, along with a one pixel thick white border on top and bottom edges of the square.
3. **Construct output:** Construct a 5 x 3 grid that represents the extracted region including the white border.

Essentially, the program extracts a specific green square region from the input and keeps it identical in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
