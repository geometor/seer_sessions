"""
1.  **Identify the Target Object:** Find a contiguous 3x3 block of pixels that all have the same color (any color) within the input grid. Record the color and the top-left coordinates of this block.
2. **Determine Output Size** If a 3x3 block is not found, return a 1x1 grid of 0. If it is found, and has a border of white above and below, return 5 x 3. If it is found and does not have a border, return 3x3.
3.  **Extract Target Object:** Create an output grid based on determined size.
4. **Case 1: No border** 3x3 found, no white border above and below.
    - Fill output grid with the color of the target object.
5. **Case 2: Border** 3x3 found, white border above and below:
   -   Fill the output grid with white (0).
   -   Replace the inner 3x3 portion of the output (rows 1 to 3 and all columns) with the identified color from step 1.
6. Return the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
