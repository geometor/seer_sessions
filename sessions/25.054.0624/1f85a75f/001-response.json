The output is a much smaller grid (5x3) containing only the colors green (3) and white (0).  The output seems to be a highly abstracted representation of a specific feature within the input.  The input contains many instances of colors 1 (blue), and 5 (gray). It contains several green pixels(3), but the output is all greens and whites. It looks like the green square from input is the only data that matters for the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
