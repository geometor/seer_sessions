Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed around identifying a 3x3 square of the same color and then potentially expanding it to 5x3 if a white border existed above and below the square. The results clearly show this approach is too simplistic and doesn't capture the full logic of the transformations. Both examples failed to produce the expected output. Example 1 incorrectly identified green where it should have produced 5x3 with 3, and Example 2 identified yellow 3x3 where it should have produced a partially bordered 4. The white border detection seems to be the primary point of failure, along with handling more than the colors.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine the Assumptions:** The initial assumption about a simple 3x3 square and white border expansion is flawed. We need to look for more complex patterns. The shapes are all 3 width, but various heights (3 or 5). The border is sometimes partial, and the core color extends into the border.

2.  **Focus on Object Properties:** Instead of just finding a 3x3 square, consider the identified region as a "core object." Analyze its properties:
    *   **Color:** The dominant color within the core object.
    *   **Border:** Does it have a full or partial border of a specific color (white, in the examples)?
    *   **Border Extension:** Does the core color extend into part of the border?
    *   Size: What are the size relations, if any

3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Start with a revised natural language program based on observations from *both* examples. Then, test this revised program and further refine it based on subsequent examples.

**Metrics and Observations (using a conceptual approach, actual code execution would be used):**

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** Large, scattered grid.
*   **Expected Output:** 5x3 grid.
*   **Identified Object:** 3x3 green square (incorrect "object", should include bordering).
*   **Observed Border:** Full border of white (0) above and below the 3x3 green square.
*   **Expected Transformation:** The core color should be 3, extending a 5x3 block bordered by the white, with 3's in all cells, and the 3s extending up and down.
* **Error Analysis**: Incorrect size, incorrect color.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** Large, scattered grid.
*   **Expected Output:** 3x3+ grid.
*   **Identified Object:** 3x3 yellow square.
*   **Observed Border:** Partial border (left, right, top-left, top-right are zeros).
*   **Expected Transformation:** 3x3+ output with border pattern.
* **Error Analysis:** Incorrect size, incorrect fill.

**YAML Fact Base:**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    core_object:
      shape: rectangle
      width: 3
      height: 3 #initial detection
      color: 3 #expected final object
      final_height: 5
    border:
      exists: true
      color: 0
      type: full #above and below only
    transformation:
      type: extend_with_border
      output_height: 5

  - example_id: 2
    core_object:
      shape: rectangle
      width: 3
      height: 3
      color: 4
      final_height: 3
    border:
      exists: true
      color: 0
      type: partial
    transformation:
      type: extend_with_border
      output_height: 3

```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Core Object:** Search for a contiguous 3x3 block of pixels that all have the same color. This is the "core object." Record the color and top-left coordinates.

2.  **Check for White Border:**
    *   Examine the rows immediately above and below the core object. If all pixels in those rows, within the same columns as the core object, are white (0), mark it as having a "full" border for expansion.
    *   If only some are, mark it as a partial border

3. **Determine output height:**
   - If full border, and 3x3 object detected, output size is 5 x 3
   - If partial border, and 3x3 object, output height is 3, and 3 wide

4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid of the determined size, initialized with white (0).

5.  **Fill Output Grid:**
    *   If there's a *full* white border above and below: Fill the entire output grid with the core object's color, then replace the above and below rows, within the columns of the found object, with 0.
    *   If there is *partial* white border: Fill the output grid according the pattern of the partial border.
    * If there is no border: Fill the output grid with the color of the target object.

6.  **Return:** Return the output grid.

This revised program takes into account both the existence and type of border (full or partial, above/below) to determine the output size and filling strategy. It moves beyond the simple "expansion" logic to a more nuanced "fill based on border" approach. The next step would be to translate this revised program into code and test it against further examples.
