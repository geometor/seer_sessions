This seems to be the background color.\n*   **Objects:** There are isolated groups of pixels of other colors (red (2), green (3), and azure (8)). These appear to be distinct objects.\n*   **Object Shapes:** Some objects are single pixels (e.g., the red and green ones in the top right of the input). Others are 2x2 squares (e.g., the red and green squares near the center and bottom). The azure (8) object at row 5, column 6 in the input is an \"L\" shape.\n* **Changes between Input and Output:** The positions of the objects is mostly the same in the Input and output. The most notable change is the azure (8) colored pixels added to expand existing object.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

These are the objects.\n2.  **Locate Target color** Find all the objects of azure color (8).\n3.  **Conditional Expansion:** Iterate through the azure objects. For the object with adjacent azure objects. Add azure color on top of adjacent, connected azure colored objects.\n4.  **Expansion:** Expand the existing azure objects by filling any adjacent, blue(1) pixels, with azure, making them part of these objects. If the object is a 2x2 shape it becomes a 4x4.\n\nIn essence, the transformation expands any \"azure\" colored connected objects that are adjacent to each other.\n"
