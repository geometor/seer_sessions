These digits correspond to colors. The primary \"objects\" appear to be clusters of non-background (non-8) pixels. The background color is consistently 8 (azure). The transformation seems to involve a local operation around these non-background pixel clusters, possibly some form of replication or shifting.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
