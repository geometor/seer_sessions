            "text": "Okay, here's an analysis of the results and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code struggles with multiple blue regions and correctly placing the 2x2 red square within them. It seems to have issues with:\n\n1.  **Inconsistent Red Square Placement:** The red square isn't always centered within the upper blue regions, and sometimes it overwrites parts of the input incorrectly.\n2.  **Incorrect Region Selection for Orange Filling:** The orange filling logic needs to better accommodate edge cases with partial borders.\n3.  **Overlapping regions:** The code isn't performant with overlapping areas.\n\nThe strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Improving Region Identification:** Refine the `find_regions` function or its usage to handle overlapping or adjacent regions more robustly.\n2.  **Precise Red Square Logic:** Modify the red square placement to be relative to each individual blue region's bounding box, ensuring it's centered and doesn't extend beyond the region's boundaries.\n3.  **Refine Border Exclusion:** Ensure the orange fill is correctly excluding border in cases where the object extends to the edge of the image.\n\n**Example Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the discrepancies:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   The red square is placed at the top-left corner instead of being centered within the top-left blue region.\n    *   Orange fill in the bottom is correct.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   The red square should be in the top right region. The code creates orange squares in the top region\n    *   The orange square isn't correctly centered within the remaining blue region.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Red squares appear, but misaligned, and orange squares are misaligned.\n    *   The code has difficulty with the multiple non-contiguous blue regions.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   The red square placement is off-center in the upper blue region.\n    *   Orange filling in the correct area\n\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *    Orange fill is in the incorrect region\n    *   Red square in the top rectangle should be lower.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: blue_regions\n    type: list\n    description: List of contiguous blue pixel regions.\n    properties:\n      - property: shape\n        type: rectangle\n        description: All blue regions appear to be generally rectangular.\n      - property: bottom_region\n        type: object\n        description: The blue region with the lowest bottom edge.\n        actions:\n          - action: fill_orange\n            description: Fill the interior of the bottom-most region with orange, excluding a 1-pixel border.\n      - property: other_regions\n        type: list\n        description: all blue regions that are not the bottom most\n        actions:\n          - action: place_red_square\n            description: Place a 2x2 red square centered within each of these regions.\n  - object: red_square\n    type: shape\n    properties:\n      - dimensions: [2, 2]\n      - color: red\n    actions:\n      - placement: center\n        description: placed in the center of top blue regions.\n  - object: orange_fill\n    type: shape_modification\n    properties:\n     - color: orange\n    actions:\n     -  placement: bottom_blue_region\n     -  constraint: exclude border\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Blue Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. Consider each region as a separate object.\n\n2.  **Bottom-Most Region Processing:**\n    *   Select the blue region with the lowest y-coordinate (bottom-most region).\n    *   Fill the interior of this selected region with orange (7), excluding a one-pixel wide border around the region.\n\n3.  **Other Regions Processing:**\n    *   For all the *other* blue regions (all blue regions that are not the bottom most)\n    *   Calculate the center coordinates (geometric center) of the region's bounding box.\n    *   Place a 2x2 square of red (2) pixels centered at the calculated center coordinates. The placement should be entirely within the blue region; if the region is too small, skip red square placement for that region.\n\n4.  **Copy Unchanged:** Any pixels that are not part of the transformed blue regions (i.e. are white) will maintain their original value.\n"
