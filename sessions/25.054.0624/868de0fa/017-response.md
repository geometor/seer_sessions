Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial strategy, while conceptually sound, misinterprets the definition of "inner regions". The current implementation defines `inner_region_1` as blue pixels adjacent to *any* white pixel, regardless of whether that white pixel is inside or outside the blue region. This leads to incorrect coloring.  `inner_region_2` selection also relies on the faulty `inner_region_1` definition. Instead, the "inner" regions should be defined with respect to the *entire* blue region's boundary, not just adjacency to white. The boundary condition is a white pixel *adjacent to the blue region*.

The key error is how the 'border' is being calculated.

The main strategy will be to:

1.  **Correct Border Identification:**  Instead of simply checking for white neighbors, we need to identify the *outer boundary* of the entire blue region.
2.  **Improve Inner Region Definition**: Refine "inner region" identification to correctly represent the areas that should be colored red.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

Here's a breakdown of each example, along with relevant metrics gathered:

| Example | Match | Pixels Off | Size Correct | Colors Correct | Notes                                                                                                                                                   |
| :------ | :---- | :--------- | :----------- | :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | False | 50         | True         | True           |  Incorrect border definition (adjacent to any white, includes exterior white). `inner_region_2` depends on faulty `inner_region_1`, so red is wrong location. |
| 2       | False | 45         | True         | True           | Same issues as Example 1.                                                                                                                            |
| 3       | False | 190        | True         | True           | Same issues as Example 1.                                                                                                                            |
| 4       | False | 50          | True        | True             | Same as above.                                                                                                              |
| 5         |False | 85       |   True      |      True         |    The border is not being correctly applied to the interior region 2.                                                           |

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_region
    description: A contiguous area of blue (1) pixels.
    properties:
      - boundary: The set of pixels surrounding the blue_region, defined by white pixels (0)
      - inner_region_1: The set of blue pixels in the blue_region directly adjacent to the boundary.  Colored orange.
      - inner_region_2: The set of blue pixels in the blue_region that is not part of inner_region_1. Colored red.

actions:
  - name: identify_boundary
    description: Find the white (0) pixels that are adjacent to a blue region
  - name: color_inner_region_1
    description: Change the color of pixels in inner_region_1 to orange (7).
  - name: color_inner_region_2
    description: Change the color of pixels in inner_region_2 to red (2).
  - name: preserve_other_colors
    description: All pixels not part of any blue_region remain unchanged.

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Blue Regions:** Find all distinct, connected regions of blue (1) pixels. These are the `blue_region` objects.
2.  **Identify the Boundary:** Find all white pixels(0) which are adjacent to the `blue_region`.
3. **Define Inner Region 1 (Orange):** For each `blue_region`, identify the blue pixels which are adjacent to the `boundary`. These constitute `inner_region_1`.
4.  **Define Inner Region 2 (Red):** For each `blue_region`, the remaining blue pixels *not* in `inner_region_1` constitute `inner_region_2`.
5.  **Color Inner Region 1:** Change the color of all pixels in `inner_region_1` to orange (7).
6.  **Color Inner Region 2:** Change the color of all pixels in `inner_region_2` to red (2).
7.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All pixels not part of any `blue_region` keep their original color.
