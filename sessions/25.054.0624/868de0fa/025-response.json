The input grid contains two distinct objects, both composed of blue (1) and white (0) pixels. The first object appears in the top half, and the second in the bottom half of the grid. The objects are rectangular outlines filled with white, except for the outer edges which are blue. The output grid maintains the structure of the blue outlines, while the insides get different solid color fillings. The top outline is filled orange(7), the bottom filled with red(2)\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Rectangles are defined by a continuous blue (1) outline, one pixel thick, enclosing an area of white (0) pixels.\n\n2.  **Determine Position:** Classify the identified rectangles based on their vertical position within the grid. Rectangles in the top half are considered \"top,\" while those in the bottom half are considered \"bottom.\"\n\n3. **Fill Top Rectangle:** For any rectangle in the \"top\" half, change all pixels within its blue outline to orange (7).\n\n4.  **Fill Bottom Rectangle:** For any rectangle in the \"bottom\" half, change all the pixels within its blue outline to red (2).\n\n5. **Preserve outline**: Keep the outline blue (1)\n\n6.  **Output:** Present the modified grid as the output.\n"
