A contiguous block consists of one or more blue pixels connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n2.  **Categorize Blocks:** Determine if each blue block is a \"top-row block.\" A block is a \"top-row block\" if *any* of its pixels are located in row 0 or row 1 of the grid.\n3.  **Transform Top-Row Blocks:**\n    *   If the top-row block starts at row 1, column 1 and the second element is 1, set the color of (1,1) to orange (7). Check the next two down and one to the right, and two to the right. Set these to orange as well if they exist.\n    *  Scan the top two rows. For every blue pixel that is part of a top-row block, trace to see if other blue pixels are connected, within the top two rows, by skipping a cell. Replace all skipped cells with orange (7).\n    *   If a contiguous block of blue pixels with 3 or more pixels *only* exists in the top two rows, and is not transformed to orange by skipping, do not transform it.\n4.  **Transform Other Blocks:** For blue blocks that are *not* top-row blocks:\n    *   If a block has 3 or more pixels, change all pixels in that block to red (2).\n5.  **Preserve White Pixels:** White (0) pixels always remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_contiguous_blocks(grid, color):\n    visited = set()\n    blocks = []\n\n    def dfs(row, col, current_block):\n        if (row, col) in visited or not (0 <= row < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= col < grid.shape[1]) or grid[row, col] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((row, col))\n        current_block.append((row, col))\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                dfs(row + dr, col + dc, current_block)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[row, col] == color and (row, col) not in visited:\n                current_block = []\n                dfs(row, col, current_block)\n                blocks.append(current_block)\n    return blocks\n\ndef is_top_row_block(block):\n    for row, _ in block:\n        if row in (0, 1):\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef transform_top_row_blocks(grid, blocks):\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n\n    # Handle (1,1) special case\n    if grid[1, 1] == 1 and grid[1,2] == 1:\n        output_grid[1, 1] = 7\n        if grid.shape[0] > 3 and grid[3,2] == 1:\n          output_grid[3,2] = 7\n        if grid.shape[1] > 3 and grid[1,3] ==1:\n            output_grid[1,3] = 7\n\n    for r in range(2):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r,c] == 1:\n              #skip transform\n                if r==0 and c+2 < grid.shape[1] and grid[r, c+2] == 1:\n                    output_grid[r,c+1] = 7\n                if r==1 and c+2 < grid.shape[1] and grid[r, c+2] == 1:\n                    output_grid[r,c+1] = 7\n                if c-2 >= 0 and grid[r, c-2] == 1:\n                    output_grid[r,c-1] = 7\n\n    return output_grid\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = input_grid.copy()\n\n    # Find all blue blocks\n    blue_blocks = find_contiguous_blocks(input_grid, 1)\n\n    # Categorize blocks\n    top_row_blocks = [block for block in blue_blocks if is_top_row_block(block)]\n    other_blocks = [block for block in blue_blocks if not is_top_row_block(block)]\n\n    # Transform top-row blocks\n    output_grid = transform_top_row_blocks(output_grid, top_row_blocks)\n    \n    # Transform other blocks\n    for block in other_blocks:\n        if len(block) >= 3:\n            for row, col in block:\n                output_grid[row, col] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
