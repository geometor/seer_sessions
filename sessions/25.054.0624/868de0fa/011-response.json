            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code has several issues. It correctly identifies contiguous blue blocks and distinguishes between \"top-row blocks\" and others. However, the transformation logic is flawed, especially the \"skip transform\" and the special case handling at (1,1). The transformation of non-top-row blocks also needs refinement. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Refine Top-Row Transformation:** Simplify and correct the logic for transforming blue blocks in the top two rows. Focus on the \"skipping\" behavior and ensure it's applied correctly and consistently.\n2.  **Improve Non-Top-Row Transformation:** Ensure that blue blocks outside the top two rows are correctly transformed to red based on their size.\n3.  **Address Edge Cases:** The current implementation performs poorly. Consider a general rule about transforming.\n4.  **Iterative Testing:** After each modification, re-evaluate against all training examples.\n5.  **Simplify logic:** Focus on clear action surrounding the blue objects.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n*   All outputs are the correct size.\n*   All outputs use the expected color palette [0,1,2,7].\n*   Pixel counts do not match expected.\n\nHere's a breakdown of observations and the proposed logic in the YAML and natural language program:\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: blue_block\n    description: Contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels.\n    properties:\n      top_row_block: True if any part of the block is in the first two rows (0 and 1), otherwise False.\n      size: The number of pixels in the block.\n    actions:\n      - if: top_row_block is True\n        then: |\n          Check for \"skipped\" blue pixels.  A skipped blue pixel is one where there's a blue pixel\n          to the left or right (but not diagonally) with exactly one pixel of any color in between within\n          the top two rows.  If a skipped pixel exists, change the in-between pixel to orange (7).\n      - if: top_row_block is False and size >= 3\n        then: Change all pixels in the block to red (2).\n      - if: starts in coordinate (1,1)\n        then: Set the (1,1) color to orange.\n  - object: white_pixel\n    description: Pixels with color white (0).\n    properties: {}\n    actions:\n      - Remain unchanged.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Blue Blocks:** Find all contiguous groups of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Top-Row Blocks (Rows 0 and 1):**\n    *   Iterate through the first two rows (row indices 0 and 1).\n    *   For each blue pixel, check for \"skipped\" blue pixels horizontally. A \"skipped\" blue pixel is defined as another blue pixel two positions away (either left or right) with one pixel (of any color) between them, all within the top two rows.\n    *   If a \"skipped\" blue pixel is found, change the color of the pixel in between to orange (7).\n3. **Check position (1,1):**\n    * If pixel at (1,1) is blue set it to orange.\n4.  **Other Blue Blocks:**\n    *   For blue blocks *not* entirely within the top two rows: If a block contains 3 or more pixels, change all pixels within that block to red (2).\n5.  **White Pixels:** White (0) pixels always remain unchanged.\n"
