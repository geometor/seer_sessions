1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels.
2.  **Preserve White:** Keep all white (0) pixels unchanged.
3.  **Inner Rectangle Rule**: Find blue objects completely enclosed within another, larger blue object. If it's at the top-left *within that enclosure*, change it to red (2). Note that "top-left" is relative to the enclosing object, not the entire grid.
4. **3x1 or 1x3 Rule**: Change a portion of a blue object that forms a 3x1 or 1x3 shape into orange (7).
5. **Other Blue Objects**: Blue objects or parts of blue objects that do not fit the above rule, do not change.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The current code is based on two main ideas: identifying enclosed blue objects and changing them to red, and identifying 3x1 or 1x3 blue lines and changing them to orange. The results show that these rules are partially correct but are not being applied correctly or completely, and potentially missing an important spatial/positional element. The consistent errors across all examples suggest a systematic flaw in either the object identification, the enclosure logic, the line detection, or the application of the transformation rules. The placement of orange and red pixels are not consistent.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Prioritize Enclosure Rule:** The enclosure rule seems more specific and potentially fundamental to the transformation. Focus first on ensuring that enclosed regions are identified and handled correctly, and that top-left within the enclosure is working.
2.  **Re-evaluate Line Detection:** The 3x1 and 1x3 rule might be incorrectly implemented, perhaps it only searches for *exactly* that shape.
3.  **Combine Rules:** Investigate how the enclosure and line rules interact. It's possible one rule should take precedence, or they apply sequentially.
4. **Consider Relative Positioning:** The rules likely depend on the relative position of blue objects to each other, and perhaps to white pixels.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a summary of each example, and a breakdown of the primary issues:

*   **All Examples:**
    *   Size is always correct.
    *   Color palette is always correct.
    *   Pixel counts are always incorrect.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   The top-left enclosed blue area should be red, not orange. There is an orange line at the top and scattered incorrectly on the left.
    *   Bottom left blue area should have an orange outline, not the whole shape

*   **Example 2:**
    *   The right enclosed area does become red but orange is also applied incorrectly.
    *   The orange application is not limited to the left line.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Again, red is not applied, orange is not applied correctly.

*   **Example 4:**
    *    Orange outline rule is not followed. Top-left enclosed blue area changes to orange, not red.

*   **Example 5:**
    *   Orange outline is incorrect. Right enclosed blue area is not changed to red.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - can be enclosed by other blue objects
      - can form 3x1 or 1x3 lines
      - can exist independently
    actions:
      - change_to: red (2)
        condition: enclosed, top-left within enclosure
      - change_to: orange (7)
        condition: forms 3x1 or 1x3 as part of outer object
  - color: white (0)
    properties:
      - static, does not change
    actions: []
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels. These are considered blue objects.
2.  **Preserve White:** White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
3.  **Inner Rectangle Rule:** Identify blue objects that are fully enclosed *within* another, larger blue object. The top-leftmost pixel of an enclosed object becomes red (2).
4. **Outer Rectangle Rule:** For all blue objects, examine the outer edge. If the blue object contains any 3x1 or 1x3 section of adjacent blue pixels, change *only those pixels* to orange.
5.  **Remaining**: All other blue pixels remain blue.

**Reasoning for changes**:
- Emphasize that orange only changes a portion of the blue, the other parts remain blue.
- Top-Leftmost clarification
- Emphasize the outer object context for the orange rule.
- Inner and Outer terminology for clarity

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
