            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code correctly identifies and fills rectangles based on their vertical position (top/bottom) in some cases, but there are inconsistencies. It seems to be confusing multiple disjoint shapes as a single object. The primary issue stems from the `find_rectangles` function's depth-first search (DFS), which doesn't adequately separate diagonally adjacent or separate rectangles.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Improve Rectangle Detection:** Modify the `find_rectangles` function to correctly identify distinct rectangular objects. The current DFS considers diagonally adjacent blue pixels as part of the same rectangle, which is incorrect. We need to enforce stricter adjacency rules (up, down, left, right) and ensure complete isolation of rectangles.\n2. **Re-evaluate Position Logic**: Check for any off-by-one errors.\n3. **Consider Edge cases:** Check that all inputs are handled correctly.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution):**\n\nI will consolidate metrics I am able to discern.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Pixels off: 13\n    *   Description: Two rectangles. Top one filled incorrectly with orange, should be red. Bottom rectangle is filled incorrectly with red, should be orange.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Pixels off: 16\n    *   Description: Two rectangles, one at top and one to the right. Top should be orange, bottom should be red.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Pixels off: 45\n    *   Description: Four rectangles, colors incorrect according to the rule.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    * Pixels off: 13\n    * Description: Two rectangles. Top one filled with orange and bottom one filled with red. The colors are swapped.\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 0\n    *   Description: Perfect match. Two rectangles, colors correct.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - type: rectangle\n    properties:\n      outline_color: blue\n      fill_color:\n        - conditional: top_half\n          color: orange\n        - conditional: bottom_half\n          color: red\n      outline_thickness: 1\n      interior: white # Before transformation\n    constraints:\n      - shape: 4-sided, right angles\n      - adjacency: Only up, down, left, right neighbors considered part of the same object\n\nactions:\n  - name: fill_interior\n    target: rectangle\n    parameter:\n      color:\n        - conditional: top_half  # Based on average row position\n          value: orange\n        - conditional: bottom_half\n          value: red\n\nconditions:\n    top_half: rectangle's average row index < (grid height / 2)\n    bottom_half: rectangle's average row index >= (grid height / 2)\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Rectangles:** Find all distinct rectangular shapes in the input grid. A rectangle is defined by a continuous blue (1) outline that is one pixel thick. The interior of a valid rectangle must be entirely white (0) before any transformations. Rectangles are distinct if they do not share any edges (up, down, left, right). Diagonally touching rectangles are considered separate.\n2.  **Determine Vertical Position:** For each identified rectangle, calculate its average row position. If the average row position is less than half the grid's height, consider the rectangle to be in the \"top half.\" Otherwise, consider it in the \"bottom half.\"\n3.  **Conditional Filling:**\n    *   If a rectangle is in the \"top half,\" fill its interior (all pixels within the blue outline, excluding the outline itself) with orange (7).\n    *   If a rectangle is in the \"bottom half,\" fill its interior with red (2).\n4. **Preserve Outlines**: Ensure the blue (1) outlines are not changed.\n5.  **Output:** The transformed grid is the final output.\n"
