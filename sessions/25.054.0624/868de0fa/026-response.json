Rectangles are defined by a continuous blue (1) outline, one pixel thick, enclosing an area of white (0) pixels.\n2.  **Determine Position:** Classify the identified rectangles based on their vertical position within the grid. Rectangles in the top half are considered \"top,\" while those in the bottom half are considered \"bottom.\"\n3. **Fill Top Rectangle:** For any rectangle in the \"top\" half, change all pixels within its blue outline to orange (7).\n4.  **Fill Bottom Rectangle:** For any rectangle in the \"bottom\" half, change all the pixels within its blue outline to red (2).\n5. **Preserve outline**: Keep the outline blue (1)\n6.  **Output:** Present the modified grid as the output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_rectangles(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds rectangular shapes with blue outline and white filling.\"\"\"\n    rectangles = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    def dfs(r, c, current_rectangle):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not is_valid(r, c) or grid[r, c] == 0:\n            return\n\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_rectangle.append((r, c))\n\n        neighbors = [(r - 1, c), (r + 1, c), (r, c - 1), (r, c + 1)]\n        for nr, nc in neighbors:\n            dfs(nr, nc, current_rectangle)\n    \n    # Find the starting pixels and the enclosed\n    for r in range(rows):\n      for c in range(cols):\n        if grid[r,c] == 1 and (r,c) not in visited:\n          current_rectangle = []\n          dfs(r,c,current_rectangle)\n          # check if rectangle by checking if it has min/max\n          if current_rectangle:\n                min_r = min(x[0] for x in current_rectangle)\n                max_r = max(x[0] for x in current_rectangle)\n                min_c = min(x[1] for x in current_rectangle)\n                max_c = max(x[1] for x in current_rectangle)\n                \n                # Check if all cells in bounding box are either 1 (outline) or 0(inside)\n                valid_rect = True\n                for i in range(min_r,max_r + 1):\n                  for j in range(min_c, max_c + 1):\n                    if (i,j) not in current_rectangle:\n                        if grid[i,j] != 0:\n                          valid_rect = False\n                          break\n\n                if valid_rect:\n                      rectangles.append(current_rectangle)\n\n\n    return rectangles\n\ndef get_rectangle_position(rectangle, grid_height):\n    \"\"\"Determines if a rectangle is in the top or bottom half.\"\"\"\n    avg_row = sum(r for r, _ in rectangle) / len(rectangle)\n    return \"top\" if avg_row < grid_height / 2 else \"bottom\"\n\ndef fill_rectangle(grid, rectangle, color):\n    \"\"\"Fills the inside of a rectangle with the specified color.\"\"\"\n    min_r = min(r for r, _ in rectangle)\n    max_r = max(r for r, _ in rectangle)\n    min_c = min(c for _, c in rectangle)\n    max_c = max(c for _, c in rectangle)\n\n    for r in range(min_r + 1, max_r):\n        for c in range(min_c + 1, max_c):\n            grid[r, c] = color\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n    # Find rectangles\n    rectangles = find_rectangles(output_grid)\n\n    # change output pixels \n    for rectangle in rectangles:\n        position = get_rectangle_position(rectangle, rows)\n        if position == \"top\":\n            fill_rectangle(output_grid, rectangle, 7)  # Fill top with orange\n        else:\n            fill_rectangle(output_grid, rectangle, 2)  # Fill bottom with red\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
