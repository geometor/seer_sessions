Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be a large rectangle composed of two colors: gray (5) and magenta (6).  The magenta region is a smaller, centered rectangle within the larger gray rectangle. The output grid is significantly smaller and seems to represent a highly abstracted version of the input. It appears the output is a 3x3 representation of the input image.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: large (e.g., 22x25)
      - colors: [gray, magenta]
      - pattern: large gray rectangle containing a centered magenta rectangle
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: small (3x3)
      - colors: [gray, magenta]
      - pattern: representation of the input image
  - action: transformation
    description: Reduces a large grid to a 3x3 representation.
    details: The center pixel of the output represents the color of the inner, centered region of the input, and output border has the same color as the input border.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the outermost border color:** Examine the input grid and determine the color of the pixels forming the outer border.
2.  **Identify the innermost object color:** Examine the input grid and determine the color of the pixels froming central rectangle region.
3.  **Create output grid:** Construct a 3x3 grid.
4.  **Populate outer layer:** Fill all border cells of a 3x3 output grid with the border color.
5.  **Populate inner layer:** Fill the single center cell of the 3x3 grid with central color.

Essentially, the transformation reduces any image to 3x3 image showing only the outer most and inner most colors.
