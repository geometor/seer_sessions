The input grid appears to contain nested rectangles of different colors. The output grid seems to be a highly compressed representation of the input, retaining only the core structure of the nested rectangles, and the innermost shape.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Note their colors (green, azure, red, blue) and nesting order (green outermost, blue innermost).\n2.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** A consistent, smaller grid that maintains the positional information of the main shapes in the original grid. In this example 7x7.\n3.  **Create Compressed Structure:** Represent the outermost green rectangle by a green border of the grid.\n4. Represent the azure rectangle by an azure border inside of the green border.\n5. Represent the red rectangle by a red border inside of the azure border.\n6. Represent the blue center as a single blue pixel within the red.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts the core \"skeleton\" of nested rectangles and their colors, discarding the redundant pixels within each rectangle's area. The output grid is like a zoomed-out, schematic view of the input grid's nested structure.\n"
