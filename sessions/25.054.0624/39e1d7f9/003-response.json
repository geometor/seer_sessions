            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the initial code and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple color swap between magenta (6) and green (3). The test results reveal that this transformation is incorrect, as evidenced by the high `pixels_off` count in all three examples. The `match` is `False` in every case. The `size_correct` is `True`, so the dimensions of grid isn't transforming, also `color_palette_correct` is true so no new colors are introduced. However, `correct_pixel_counts` is false, showing a problem.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the transformation rule. Because only some pixels change, the existing hypothesis is too broad. We need to inspect where green and magenta colors *are* in each input and output, to see if the error provides clues.\n\n**Example Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo better understand the errors, let's examine each example, focusing on the green and magenta pixels. I'll provide coordinate lists and counts and compare the input, expected, and the actual transformation output.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ninput_grid = np.array([\n    [0,
