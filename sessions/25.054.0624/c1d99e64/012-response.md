"""
1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Iterate through Pixels:** Examine each pixel in the grid, one by one.
3.  **Trigger Condition:** For each pixel, check if its color is white (0) AND if its column index has a remainder of 4 when divided by 5 (column index `mod` 5 equals 4).
4.  **Pixel Transformation:** If *both* conditions in step 3 are true for a pixel, change that pixel's color to red (2).
5.  **Preservation:** All other pixels that do *not* meet both trigger conditions remain unchanged.
6.  **Output:** The grid with the transformed pixels becomes the output.
