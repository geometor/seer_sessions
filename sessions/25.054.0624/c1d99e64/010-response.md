"""
1.  **Initialization:** Begin with the input grid.
2.  **Iterate Rows:** Examine each row of the input grid, one at a time.
3.  **Trigger Condition:** Within each row, check if there's *any* white pixel (color 0) where the column index `mod 5` is equal to `4`.
4.  **Row Transformation:** If the condition in step 3 is met for a given row (at least one white pixel exists at the correct column position), change *all* white pixels (color 0) in that *entire* row to red (color 2).
5.  **Preserve Other Colors:** Pixels that are not white in rows that satisfy the condition will be preserved.
6.  **Output:** The modified grid, with the transformed rows, becomes the output.
