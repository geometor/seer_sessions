The input grid appears to be transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions. The primary colors involved are blue (1), white (0), and red (2). The transformation seems to involve a specific geometric pattern: a red cross is overlaid onto the input, replacing existing values. The positioning of the cross seems to be consistently in the center. The entire 9th row is red and every 9th column is red.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
