The primary colors involved seem to be green (3), white (0), and red (2). The transformation appears to involve a selective replacement of white (0) pixels with red (2) pixels, while green (3) pixels remain unchanged. The red pixels appear to form horizontal lines in the regions where the white pixels were.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
