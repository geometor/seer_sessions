Here's my breakdown of the input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** Both input and output are 29x29 grids.\n*   **Colors:** The input grid uses colors 0 (white), and 1 (blue). The output grid uses colors 1 (blue), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).\n*   **Shapes:** The input grid contains blue (1) lines forming a complex, interconnected shape, somewhat resembling a maze or a circuit. These lines are mostly one pixel wide, but there are a few thicker sections. The rest of the input is white (0).\n*    The output colors create regions or zones.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These pixels form the \"blue lines\" object.\n2.  **Identify Enclosed Regions.** Determine the regions enclosed by the continuous blue lines. An enclosed region is a set of contiguous white pixels that are completely surrounded by blue pixels, directly adjacent, forming a closed loop.\n3. **Change color of first enclosed area:** Change the enclosed area above the first horizontal solid line of 1's to green (3)\n4. **Change color of second enclosed area:** Change the enclosed area below the first horizontal solid line of 1's to yellow (4).\n5.  **Preserve Blue Lines:** Maintain the blue (1) pixels in their original positions in the output grid.\n6.  **Other areas:** All other enclosed areas not specified before get a fill value according to their position, if they are above the first line of 1's then the value is 3, otherwise the value is 4.\n\n"
