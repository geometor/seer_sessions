Identify White Regions: Identify contiguous regions of white (0) pixels. Consider pixels connected horizontally, vertically, and diagonally as part of the same region.\n3. Conditional Color Change within white connected regions:\n    *   The upper-left region of white bounded by maroon is changed to yellow.\n    *   The lower-right region of white bounded by maroon is changed to green.\n4. Output: Create a new grid with the maroon pixels in their original positions, and the white regions replaced based the regions determined in the previous step.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_contiguous_regions(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous regions of a given color in the grid.\"\"\"\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    regions = []\n\n    def dfs(row, col, current_region):\n        \"\"\"Depth-first search to explore a region.\"\"\"\n        if (\n            row < 0\n            or row >= grid.shape[0]\n            or col < 0\n            or col >= grid.shape[1]\n            or visited[row, col]\n            or grid[row, col] != color\n        ):\n            return\n\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        current_region.append((row, col))\n\n        # Explore adjacent cells (including diagonals)\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                dfs(row + dr, col + dc, current_region)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[row, col] == color and not visited[row, col]:\n                current_region = []\n                dfs(row, col, current_region)\n                regions.append(current_region)\n\n    return regions\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # Find maroon (9) pixels - these remain unchanged, so done in copy step\n    \n    # Find white (0) regions\n    white_regions = find_contiguous_regions(input_grid, 0)\n\n    # Determine which region is \"upper-left\" and which is \"lower-right\"\n    # We'll do this by comparing the average row/col of each region.\n\n    if len(white_regions) >= 2:\n       \n        region_centers = []\n        for region in white_regions:\n            coords = np.array(region)\n            avg_row = np.mean(coords[:, 0])\n            avg_col = np.mean(coords[:, 1])\n            region_centers.append( (avg_row, avg_col) )\n\n        #find region with the lowest combined row and col values\n        upper_left_index = np.argmin( [ sum(center) for center in region_centers ] )\n\n        #change colors by identified region index\n        for i, region in enumerate(white_regions):\n            new_color = 4 if i == upper_left_index else 3\n            for row, col in region:\n                output_grid[row, col] = new_color\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
