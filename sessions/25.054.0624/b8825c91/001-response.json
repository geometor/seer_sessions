The transformation seems to maintain the overall structure of the grid (same dimensions) but alters the colors of specific regions. The most prominent change is the central block of pixels. It appears a specific color swap or \"fill\" operation occurs within the central region.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Visual inspection suggests this region covers a significant portion of the grid's center.\n2.  **Conditional Color Swap:** Within the *central region only*:\n    *   If a pixel is yellow (4), change it to green (3).\n    *   If a pixel is magenta (6), change it to blue (1).\n    *   If a pixel is azure (8), change it to maroon (9).\n3. **Preserve Other Pixels:** All pixels outside the central region, and those within the central region *not* matching the colors above, remain unchanged.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**\n\n*   **Central Region Definition:** The exact dimensions and positioning of the central region need precise definition. We need a consistent rule, not just visual estimation. It is likely relative to the size of the overall input grid.\n*   **Color Swap Rule:** The identified color swaps (4->3, 6->1, 8->9) are based on this single example. More examples are needed to confirm this is the complete and correct rule, or if there are additional color mappings or a more general pattern.\n*   It would be ideal to verify these observations with the coder phase before moving on.\n\n"
