"""
1.  **Identify Azure (8) Pixels:** Locate all pixels that are azure (color 8).
2.  **Conditional Changes based on adjacent colors**
    *   If an azure (8) pixel is adjacent to the edge of an object of color 4, the
        azure pixel might change to a different color, such as 3,5,9, based on
        relative position, and potentially the color 4 object it belongs to.
    *   If a pixel of color 4 is adjacent to an object of color 6, change to a 1.
    *   Re-examine edge concept and object shape. Example 3 has different 
        transformations.
