Determine the set of colors directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to that shape.\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation Rules:**\n    *   If a pixel of color 4 is surrounded by colors including 6, and is directly above, below, to the left or to the right of a pixel of color 4, then:\n        * if the surroundings also include 9, change color 4 to color 3.\n        * If the surroundings also include 1 and 8, change color 4 to 8.\n        * If the surroundings also include 5, change color 4 to 1\n        * If the surroundings also include 8, change color 4 to 1.\n    * If a pixel of color 1 is surrounded by colors including 6, and is directly above, below, to the left or to the right of a pixel of color 4, then:\n        * if the surroundings also include 9, change color 1 to 9.\n        * If the surroundings also include 8, change color 1 to 5.\n        * if the surroundings also include 2, change color 1 to 5.\n        * If the surroundings also include 3 and 7, change color 1 to 2.\n        * If the surroundings also include 8, change color 1 to 2.\n    * If a pixel of color 4 is surrounded by 1,2,7,8,9, change to 2\n    * If a pixel of color 4 is surrounded by 1,3,6,7,9, change to 5\n    * Otherwise, the pixel's color remains unchanged.\n\n4.
