observations:
  - example: 1
    objects:
      - color: yellow
        shape: variable
        moved: true
        movement_rule: adjacent_to_green
        integrity: partially_preserved
      - color: green
        shape: variable
        moved: false
      - color: azure
        shape: variable
        moved: false
    notes: "Yellow objects should be moved next to green, preserving shape if possible. Current code moves incorrectly and removes parts of the yellow objects."

  - example: 2
    objects:
      - color: yellow
        shape: variable
        moved: true
        movement_rule: adjacent_to_green
        integrity: not_preserved
      - color: green
        shape: variable
        moved: false
      - color: azure
        shape: variable
        moved: false
    notes: "Yellow objects move very little. Many green objects are incorrectly colored yellow."

  - example: 3
    objects:
      - color: yellow
        shape: rectangle
        moved: true
        movement_rule: adjacent_to_green
        integrity: not_preserved, splits into many parts
      - color: green
        shape: variable
        moved: false
    notes: "The large yellow rectangle should be split to move parts adjacent to green.  Current implementation removes many green and makes no movement."
