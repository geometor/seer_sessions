Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The primary visual elements are grids of colored pixels. The colors used are white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), and azure (8). The most salient feature seems to be the insertion and movement of azure (8) colored regions, specifically in areas related to green(3) and yellow(4) regions. The input and output grids are the same size.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output grids are 2D arrays of the same dimensions.
    dimensions: 21x21
  - type: object
    description: Pixels are the fundamental objects, represented by color values.
  - type: color_values
    values: [0, 3, 4, 8]
    descriptions: [white, green, yellow, azure]
  - type: observation
    description: Azure (8) pixels appear to be added or moved within the grid.
  - type: observation, potentially important
    description: The changes in position of the azure color seem related to green and yellow contiguous blocks.
  - type: relationship, requires verification
    description: "If a large enough shape of 3s exists, move/create an 8 on top of it"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Regions:** Locate contiguous regions of green (3) pixels. I will call these "green objects".
2.  **Assess Region Size/Shape**: Determine which of those regions, if any, has an azure (8) block related to them.
3.  **Apply Transformation:** Within the green object, find sections of green (3) pixels that form a horizontal line adjacent to, or are part of, a bigger block, and convert some or all of those pixels to azure (8). It appears the location that the 8s get moved to are next to the block of 4.

The transformation rule is: For each green object that is related to an azure block, move the azure block from its existing location to overlap or be contained by the green object. If there is already an azure block inside the green object, the move operation consists of a translation only.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
