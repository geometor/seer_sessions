The same general shape made of yellow is recognizable in the output, although it seems to move around with some interference from other colors.\n*   **Background:** The background is a noisy mix of red (2), green(3), white(0), and rarely blue(1).\n*    **Change**: the yellow shape seems to remain unchanged between input and output, the only changes occur on the border of the yellow shape\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The rest of the grid is untouched.\n"
