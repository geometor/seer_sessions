The colors used are white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), and azure (8). The most salient feature seems to be the insertion and movement of azure (8) colored regions, specifically in areas related to green(3) and yellow(4) regions. The input and output grids are the same size.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

I will call these \"green objects\".\n2.  **Assess Region Size/Shape**: Determine which of those regions, if any, has an azure (8) block related to them.\n3.  **Apply Transformation:** Within the green object, find sections of green (3) pixels that form a horizontal line adjacent to, or are part of, a bigger block, and convert some or all of those pixels to azure (8). It appears the location that the 8s get moved to are next to the block of 4.\n\nThe transformation rule is: For each green object that is related to an azure block, move the azure block from its existing location to overlap or be contained by the green object. If there is already an azure block inside the green object, the move operation consists of a translation only.\n"
