The output grid seems to construct a rectangular border around each isolated green pixel, extending both vertically and horizontally. The green pixels are maintained. There's also an apparent \"filling\" operation happening within the areas bounded, but it's constrained by the single green pixel. It is an \"expansion\" of green pixels within constraints.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
