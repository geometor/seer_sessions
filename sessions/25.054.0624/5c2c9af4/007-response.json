Sparse 'red' (2) pixels are scattered seemingly at random within the input. The output grid has a significantly different structure. It appears to be composed of concentric, nested squares or rectangles of 'red' (2) pixels, with a 'white' (0) background. The 'red' shapes are connected, with varying spacing between the \"layers\" of the nested squares. The output image appears to be a complete transformation - no single red pixels and no isolated components.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
