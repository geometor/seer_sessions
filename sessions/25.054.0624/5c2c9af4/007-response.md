Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grid consists primarily of background pixels of color 'white' (0).  Sparse 'red' (2) pixels are scattered seemingly at random within the input. The output grid has a significantly different structure. It appears to be composed of concentric, nested squares or rectangles of 'red' (2) pixels, with a 'white' (0) background. The 'red' shapes are connected, with varying spacing between the "layers" of the nested squares. The output image appears to be a complete transformation - no single red pixels and no isolated components.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    role: static, fills empty space
  - object: red_pixels
    color: red (2)
    input_state: scattered, isolated
    output_state: connected, forming nested squares
  - transformation: dilation_and_connection
    description: Red pixels expand and connect to form nested square structures.
  - spatial_relationship: input_to_output
    description:  The positions of the initial red pixels in the input influence, but do not directly correspond to, the positions of red pixels in the output.  The output's structure is a global transformation, not a local one.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all 'red' (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Create** a new grid filled with 'white' (0) pixels.
3.  **Iteratively draw** expanding, connected, and nested squares composed of red pixels.
  * start the outermost square by filling most of the border (except corners, to allow for background color).
  * each inner square should be one row/column smaller at each border.
  * the number of nested square levels, their sizes, and their placements are defined by expanding all original red pixels until connected in this nested pattern.
4. **Output** the resulting grid. The process is essentially creating a new, connected pattern of filled, nested shapes - not transforming existing shapes.
