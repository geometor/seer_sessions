The primary colors observed are gray (5) and white (0). The transformation introduces red (2) pixels in specific locations within the gray areas. The overall grid dimensions remain constant. The shape formed by white pixels doesn't change, but some of the surrounding gray pixels are changed to red, seemingly \"filling in\" or \"thickening\" certain regions on one side of the shape.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Specifically:\n\n    *   Iterate over the pixels on the outside of the shape.\n    *   Fill gray (5) pixel directly to the left or bottom of the shape\n    *   Fill if a gray (5) pixel is to the lower-left diagonally\n\n4. **Preserve:** Ensure the original white (0) shape is preserved. The transformation only involves changing gray (5) to red (2).\n\n5. **Maintain boundaries:** Ensure the grid boundaries are not crossed. Only operate on existing pixel locations.\n"
