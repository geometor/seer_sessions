These regions may have irregular shapes.\n\n2.  **Selective Filling:** Starting at row index 5, and moving left to right, and downward by one row, for all regions identified in the prior stage: if there is white (0) pixel, paint it and every pixel to the right of it, until the next grey pixel, with '2'.\n    - continue until the last row of the output\n\n3.  **Preserve Boundaries:** The gray (5) pixels in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.
