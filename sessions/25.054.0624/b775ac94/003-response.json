            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies contiguous objects (non-zero pixels) and attempts to replicate them. However, it fails to capture the core logic of how colors and shapes are modified and extended. It appears to be missing the context of how objects connect/relate to each other and extend other objects. The matching assessment also points out a significant number of mismatched pixels, so overall our approach is not generalizing.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Relationships:** The transformation seems to extend objects based on adjacency and color relationships. We need to shift from simply copying objects to analyzing how objects *interact* and *influence* each other's colors/shapes.\n2.  **Neighborhood Analysis:** Instead of just looking at an object in isolation, consider its neighboring pixels (including diagonals) to determine how it should be extended or modified.\n3. **Object Extension:** It seems that object extend themselves, possibly into background.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code_execution is not available here - manually reporting - see next step for automated results):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Multiple disconnected objects of different colors.\n    *   Output: Objects are extended, and some colors \"bleed\" into adjacent areas, especially horizontally. Some diagonal connections, too. The final result has many more colored pixels\n    *   Mismatched Pixels: 39\n    *   Objects: correctly identifies original objects, but extension creates overlap and incorrect color spread\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Two main horizontal objects (red and another of green/blue).\n    *   Output: Each object expands to fill alternating rows. Colors are adjacent\n    *   Mismatched Pixels: 24\n    *   Objects: correctly identifies, extension not accurate.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: Several small, disconnected objects.\n    *   Output: Objects are connected and extend colors into adjacent rows\n    *   Mismatched Pixels: 18\n    *   Objects: correctly identifies, extension/connection not implemented\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  objects:\n    - color: 2 # red\n      shape: blob\n      adjacent: [1, 7] # blue, orange\n      extended: true\n      extension_direction: horizontal, vertical\n    - color: 1 # blue\n      shape: blob\n      adjacent: [2] #red\n      extended: true\n      extension_direction: horizontal\n    - color: 7 # orange\n      shape: blob\n      adjacent: [2, 4] #red, yellow\n      extended: true\n      extension_direction: horizontal\n    - color: 4 # yellow\n      shape: blob\n      adjacent: [7,3] # orange, green\n      extended: true\n      extension_direction: horizontal, vertical\n    - color: 3 # green\n       shape: blob\n       adjacent: [4,2] # yellow, red\n       extended: true\n       extension_direction: horizontal\n    - color: 8 # light blue\n      shape: blob\n      adjacent: [2,3] # red, green\n      extended: true\n      extension_direction: horizontal, vertical\n    - color: 6\n      shape: single\n      adjacent: []\n      extended: false\n\nexample_2:\n  objects:\n    - color: 2 # Red\n      shape: horizontal_line\n      adjacent: [8]\n      extended: true\n      extension_direction: vertical\n    - color: 8 # light blue\n      shape: blob\n      adjacent: [2]\n      extended: true\n      extension_direction: none #appears that the red line creates it\n    - color: 4\n      shape: horizontal_line\n      adjacent: [3] #green\n      extended: true\n      extension_direction: vertical\n    - color: 3 #green\n      shape: blob\n      adjacent: [4]\n      extended: true\n      extension_direction: none #yellow object grows\n\nexample_3:\n  objects:\n    - color: 8 # light blue\n      shape: blob\n      adjacent: [4]\n      extended: true\n      extension_direction: vertical, horizontal\n    - color: 4\n      shape: single\n      adjacent: [8,6,2] # light blue, magenta, red\n      extended: true\n      extension_direction: horizontal\n    - color: 6\n      shape: single\n      adjacent: [4]\n      extended: true\n      extension_direction: horizontal\n    - color: 1\n      shape: blob\n      adjacent: [2,4]\n      extended: true\n      extension_direction: horizontal, vertical\n    - color: 2\n      shape: line\n      adjacent: [4,1]\n      extended: true\n      extension_direction: horizontal, vertical\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous clusters of non-zero pixels in the input grid. Each cluster is an object.\n2.  **Object Expansion:** Each object attempts to expand.\n3.  **Expansion Rules:**\n    *   An object expands horizontally and/or vertically into adjacent (including diagonally) background (0-colored) pixels.\n    *   If an object is adjacent to another object, it may take on some of other objects color during expansion, as long as the color is adjacent. The color will extend in alternating lines.\n\nThis revised natural language program focuses on the *interaction* and *expansion* of objects, which seems to be the key concept missing in the previous iteration. The \"alternating rows\" and adjacency rules are crucial for capturing the observed transformations.\n"
