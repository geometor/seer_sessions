Previous Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_metrics(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    if transformed_output is None:
        return {
            'match': "ERROR",
            'pixels_off': None,
            'size_correct': None,
            'color_palette_correct': None,
            'correct_pixel_counts': None,
        }
    match = np.array_equal(expected_output, transformed_output)
    pixels_off = None if match else np.sum(expected_output != transformed_output)
    size_correct = expected_output.shape == transformed_output.shape
    
    expected_colors = set(np.unique(expected_output))
    transformed_colors = set(np.unique(transformed_output))
    color_palette_correct = expected_colors == transformed_colors

    expected_counts = {color: np.sum(expected_output == color) for color in expected_colors}
    transformed_counts = {color: np.sum(transformed_output == color) for color in transformed_colors}
    correct_pixel_counts = expected_counts == transformed_counts
    
    return {
        'match': match,
        'pixels_off': pixels_off,
        'size_correct': size_correct,
        'color_palette_correct': color_palette_correct,
        'correct_pixel_counts': correct_pixel_counts,
    }
#dummy data
input_grid = np.zeros((3,3))
expected_output = np.zeros((3,3))
transformed_output = np.zeros((3,3))
metrics = calculate_metrics(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output)
print (metrics)

```

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:

Input:
```
None
```
Expected Output:
```
None
```
match: None
pixels_off: None
size_correct: None
color_palette_correct: None
correct_pixel_counts: None
Okay, here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to move forward.

**General Assessment:**

The initial attempt resulted in a dummy function that simply returns a zero-filled array. This is a basic starting point, and as expected, it doesn't solve any of the tasks (as evidenced by the `None` values for everything in the provided example). We need to analyze the actual input/output pairs from the training examples to discern the transformation rule. Since I don't have any training data, It is impossible to determine the pattern, and impossible to derive the natural language program.

The provided code does include a very useful function for evaluating the performance of predicted outputs, so i will use that in the next steps.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Gather Data:** Execute provided `calculate_metrics` function on the available data.
2.  **Analyze Results, Identify Objects and Actions:** Examine the input and output grids, and corresponding metrics, to identify:
    *   **Objects:** What are the distinct elements within the grids (e.g., shapes, lines, individual pixels)?
    *   **Properties:** What are the characteristics of these objects (e.g., color, size, position, shape)?
    *   **Actions:** How are these objects being manipulated or transformed (e.g., moved, resized, recolored, rotated)?
3.  **Formulate Natural Language Program:** Based on the object/action analysis, create a concise, step-by-step description of the transformation rule in plain English.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Develop code and use the test input/output data and compare results. Use errors to inform changes in the NL program.

**Example Metrics Reports (Placeholder):**

I am unable to create a report, because I do not have any example grids.

**YAML Fact Block (Placeholder):**

Because I am unable to examine examples, the YAML block contains general facts, and not specific ones.

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Grids are 2D arrays of integer values.
  - observation: |
      Each integer represents a color.
  - observation: |
      Transformations involve changes to the grid.
  - observation: |
     The goal is to determine the rule to change the input to the output.
```

**Natural Language Program (Placeholder):**

Since I don't have any training data, It is impossible to determine the pattern. I will create an initial program as placeholder.

```
1.  Examine the input.
2.  Return the input.
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
