The full outline, or portions of the original blue object are traced.\n4. **Locate Green Pixel** in original object.\n5. Replicate Green pixel.\n6. Replicate object and outline, rotating to match Green Pixel location on replicated outline.\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts the blue object, traces some or all of its exterior with red pixels, and highlights a specific point or points on that outline with green pixels. The original and duplicated object green highlights are swapped.\n"
