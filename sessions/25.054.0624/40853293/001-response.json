The input grid contains isolated pixels of different colors (red, green, blue, magenta, gray). The output grid seems to replicate these colored pixels, but with some changes:\n\n1.  The single pixels of color red (2), green (3) and gray (8), have become vertical lines of those same color.\n2.  There's one color, magenta (6), that has become a horizontal line of the same color.\n3.  Some color patterns (gray(5) and magenta(6)) has changed the magenta(6) pixel to be adjacent, and extend the gray (5).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
