The primary element is the existence of single, isolated colored pixels in the input grid. These isolated pixels seem to trigger the creation of vertical and horizontal lines of the same color in the output grid. The lines extend from the original pixel's position. The lines appear to be one pixel wide. The output retains the colors of input singletons, but fills in adjacent pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

All original pixels are kept.\n"
