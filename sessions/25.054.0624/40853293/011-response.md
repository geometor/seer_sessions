Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial strategy of identifying isolated pixels and creating plus shapes centered on them is partially correct. However, the current implementation has several issues:

1.  **Overlapping Plus Shapes:** The horizontal extension takes precedence, leading to incorrect shapes and color overwrites when plus shapes intersect, especially evident in Example 2.
2.  **Incorrect Extension Logic:** The extension logic doesn't correctly handle cases where a non-white pixel is encountered *before* the original isolated pixel is reached. The program assumes that the non-white cells should not be colored.
3. **Misinterpretation of Isolation**: My initial logic to preserve the original cell color was wrong - the plus-shaped objects extend until either the edge of the grid, or a non-white object is met.

The main strategy for resolving these errors will involve:
* revisiting the extension logic so that extensions can color until the edge or non-white pixels are reached.
* prioritizing merging by maintaining the color of the isolated pixel in overlaps

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a summary of the examples, including observations:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** Multiple isolated pixels of different colors (2, 3, 8, 6, 5). Some are close together.
*   **Expected Output:** Plus shapes of corresponding colors. Overlapping regions seem arbitrary.
*   **Actual Output:** Incorrect plus shapes. Many overlaps are handled incorrectly, with horizontal extensions overwriting vertical ones.
*  The transformed image extends to the edge, instead of stopping at the closest non-white pixel.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** Isolated pixels of different colors (4, 3, 7, 8, 9), some very close.
*   **Expected Output:** Plus shapes, with some overlaps.
*   **Actual Output:** Incorrect plus shapes and overlaps. Horizontal extensions dominate.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - isolated: boolean  # Whether the pixel is surrounded by white pixels or the grid edge.
      - color: integer (0-9)  # The color of the pixel.

actions:
  - name: extend_horizontally
    description: Extend a pixel's color to the left and right until a non-white pixel or grid edge is encountered.
  - name: extend_vertically
    description: Extend a pixel's color up and down until a non-white pixel or grid edge is encountered.
  - name: overlap_priority
    description: When horizontal and vertical extensions from two different pluses would overlap, keep the initial isolated pixel color.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Isolated Pixels:** Find all non-white pixels that are surrounded by white pixels or the edge of the grid on all four sides (up, down, left, right).

2.  **Create Plus Shapes:** For each isolated pixel:
    *   Extend the pixel's color horizontally, both left and right. Stop the extension in each direction when a non-white pixel or the edge of the grid is reached.
    *   Extend the pixel's color vertically, both up and down. Stop the extension in each direction when a non-white pixel or the edge of the grid is reached.

3.  **Handle Overlaps:** If, during the extension, a pixel's extension would overwrite a pixel that is already part of *another* isolated pixel's extension, maintain the initial isolated pixel color.

4. **Output:** The final grid will consist of these plus-shaped objects, potentially with some overlaps handled as described in step 3.
