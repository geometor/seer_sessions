"""
The transformation rule is not a simple identity operation. It appears there's a pattern of changes, likely localized,
affecting certain pixel values, often involving the color 0 (white), especially in areas where it forms larger
contiguous regions. We will preserve the input grid dimensions, and, initially, make a copy
and selectively modify ONLY pixels where the color is 0, based on analysis of the
training data, and we will test to see if we can discern a simple replacement rule.
