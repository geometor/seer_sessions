The input grid appears to have a large central region of white (0) pixels surrounded by a repeating pattern of other colors. The output grid seems to be a simplified or \"cleaned\" version of the input, where the central white region and some other areas have been removed, leaving only the repeating border pattern. The core transformation appears to be the removal of a large connected component (the white shape).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
