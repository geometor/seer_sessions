The primary colors involved are green (3) and white (0). There's an introduction of blue (1) in the output grid in a specific, localized area. The overall structure of the green and white pattern remains identical between the input and output, except for the introduction of the small blue region. The location of the new blue pixels are areas that were white.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
