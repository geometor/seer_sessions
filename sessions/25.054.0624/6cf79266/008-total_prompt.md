Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are 20x20 grids. The primary colors involved are green (3) and white (0). There's an introduction of blue (1) in the output grid in a specific, localized area. The overall structure of the green and white pattern remains identical between the input and output, except for the introduction of the small blue region. The location of the new blue pixels are areas that were white.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 20x20
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color_values: [0, 1, 3]

  - name: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          type: integer
          values:
            0: white
            1: blue
            3: green

  - name: blue_region
    type: object
    properties:
      - shape: square like
      - size: small
      - color: blue
      - location: center-left
      - composed of : pixels

actions:
  - name: identify_region
    description: Locate a specific region based on color and shape.
  - name: change_color
    description: Modify the color of pixels within the region.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The grid consists of pixels arranged in rows and columns.
  - type: containment
    description: The blue region is contained within the grid.
  - type: transformation
    description: input pixels become output pixels. The color remains unchanged except white pixels in a certain area.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Region:** Locate a region on the grid where the original color is white. It seems to be a 3x3 shaped region on the left, vertically centered.
2.  **Change Color:** Change the color of the internal 3x3 pixels of that region to blue (1).
3. **Preserve other pixels**: All other pixels keep the colors from the input to the output.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
