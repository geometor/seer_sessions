The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), blue (1), and yellow (4). The transformation seems to involve a selective deletion or movement of certain colored objects/pixels based on their color and possibly their spatial relationship to other objects. The yellow (4) in the input is not in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
