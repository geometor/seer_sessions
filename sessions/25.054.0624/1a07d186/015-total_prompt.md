1. **Identify Key Feature:** Locate the horizontal line of azure (8) pixels that spans the entire width of the grid. This line appears to be constant between input and output and is on row index 5 (counting starts with zero).

2. **Preserve Line:** Keep all pixels on this horizontal line unchanged.

3. **Conditional Removal Above:** For all rows *above* the identified line, any azure (8) or blue (1) pixel which is not within the azure line, is removed (changed to white/0).

4. **Conditional Removal Below:** For rows *below* the identified line, any blue(1) pixels is removed. Azure(8) is removed unless it is directly above or below the azure line of pixels

5. Leave all white(0) pixels as they are.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
