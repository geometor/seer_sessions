The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and azure (8).  The input grid contains seemingly randomly placed azure and blue pixels, while the output grid seems to have removed some of them based on a specific, yet-to-be-determined rule. The most obvious feature is a horizontal line of azure (8) pixels across the middle of both grids.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
