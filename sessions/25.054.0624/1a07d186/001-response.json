The grids contain single-digit numbers representing colors. The most prominent colors are 0 (white), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow). There's also a single 2 (red) in the input that disappears in the output.  The green and yellow colors appear to form vertical lines. The transformation seems to involve some interaction or modification of the green and yellow vertical lines, possibly based on adjacency. The red pixel seems to be irrelevant.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
