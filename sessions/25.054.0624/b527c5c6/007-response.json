The input grid contains two primary shapes: a horizontal rectangle of green (3) pixels with a single red (2) pixel near the right end, and a vertical rectangle of green (3) pixels, also with a single red (2) pixel, near the bottom. The rest of the input grid is filled with white (0) pixels. The output grid seems to highlight certain pixels in and around these rectangles. The large horizontal green rectangle and the vertical green rectangle get their red pixels duplicated, specifically the input red pixel is maintained, and it is copied to the left of the original on the upper horizontal bar, and upwards on the vertical one. The red pixel in the horizontal rectangle appears copied across the entire lower section of the rectangle.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
