Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves manipulating a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are white (0), green (3), and red (2). The transformation seems to involve some kind of selective modification of existing objects and potentially the creation of new ones based on certain criteria. The input grid contains two distinct green (3) objects, each containing a single red (2) pixel. The output seems to modify the top-left green object and creates a new red object to the left of the lower-right green object.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object_1:
      type: rectangle
      color: green (3)
      position: top-left
      contains:
        - type: pixel
          color: red (2)
          relative_position: within
  - object_2:
      type: rectangle
      color: green (3)
      position: bottom-right
      contains:
        - type: pixel
          color: red (2)
          relative_position: within
  - action:
      type: modification
      target: object_1
      description: The top three rows of pixels where x < 9 are turned into the following. Green pixels become white, and white pixels stay white, excluding the red pixel, which is not modified.
  - action:
      type: creation
      new_object: object_3
      object_3:
          type: rectangle
          color: red
          position: to the left of object_2, aligned to the top of object 2
          description: All the green pixels in object_2 are extended one unit to the left. The single red pixel is extended to the left filling all the new created space.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Top-Left Object Modification:** Identify the green (3) rectangular object in the top-left quadrant of the input grid. Within this object, locate the single red (2) pixel. For the top three rows of this green object, if the x index is less than 9, change all green (3) pixels to white (0).

2.  **Bottom-Right Object Extension:** Identify the green (3) rectangular object at the lower part of the input grid. Add a column of red (2) pixels adjacent to the left edge of this bottom-right object, aligning it with the top row of the original bottom-right object. The red pixels mirror the shape of the adjacent border of the green object.

Essentially, the top-left green object is partially "erased" or trimmed, while the lower object gains an adjacent red region.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
