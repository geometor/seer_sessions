The primary colors involved seem to be green (3), red (2), and white (0). The transformation appears to involve some kind of interaction between the green and red pixels, potentially related to their position and adjacency. The white pixels seem to act as a background and are possibly unchanged. The overall shape of the connected green component is altered, with some parts expanding vertically. Some red pixels are also introduced on the right side.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These form the primary objects.\n\n2.  **Vertical Expansion (Green):**  For the leftmost green object, expand the green region downwards. The expansion extends to the bottom of the grid. The width of this object matches the original width, and the y coordinates are maintained.\n\n3.  **Red Replacement:** All red pixels on the left become part of the expanding left green block.\n\n4.  **Red Addition (Right Side):** For the right green object. Add red pixels at the right edge of the expanded shape. It appears this starts at the original red square on the right of the initial shape and continues downwards.\n\n5. **Vertical Expansion (Red):** Expand any new red regions vertically downwards until the bottom of the board.\n\nIn summary, the leftmost green object expands down, replacing any reds on the left and encompassing them. Red pixels are generated on the right boundary of the rightmost green object and expand down.\n"
