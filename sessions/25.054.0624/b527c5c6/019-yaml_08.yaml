        location: within green_region_out_1 and grid_in.red_pixel_1

observations:
  - The overall grid dimensions remain constant.
  - The green region in the top-left is largely preserved.
  - The white region in the bottom right corner seems to have a vertical red bar painted along the green L shape.
  - The single red pixel within the green shape also persists from the input to output
  - The single red pixel is replicated downwards.
