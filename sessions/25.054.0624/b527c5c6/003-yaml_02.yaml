    observations: |
        The left-most green object expands down. The red pixel to the left of the
        left green is replaced by green. The right green adds red to it's right
        and expands down starting at the location of any adjecent red pixels.

        action: expand_down_red
    observations: |
        The left-most green object expands down. There is a single red pixel to
        the right of the rightmost green. This triggers the rule to extend this
        shape down in red. The middle green object expands down.
