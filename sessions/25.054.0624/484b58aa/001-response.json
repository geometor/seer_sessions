The most obvious change between the input and output is the removal of all white (0) pixels. There are different colored pixels present, and it seems like the core concept relies on identifying and removing, or filtering out a specific color (white/0). The other colored pixels seem unaffected by the transformation. The overall grid dimensions (height and width) are preserved.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
