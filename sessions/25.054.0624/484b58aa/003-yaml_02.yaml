      - example_id: 1
        input_objects:
          - object_id: grid_1
            type: grid
            colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
            shape: [29, 29]
            has_white: true
            white_pixel_count: 59
        output_objects:
          - object_id: grid_1_transformed
            type: grid
            colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
            shape: [29, 29] #expected shape
            has_white: false # ideally
            white_pixel_count: 0
        transformation: remove_white
        notes: "The output grid should not contain any white pixels (0). The positions of other color pixels should be maintained relative to each other."

      - example_id: 2
        input_objects:
          - object_id: grid_2
            type: grid

            has_white: false
            white_pixel_count: 0
        transformation: remove_white
        notes: "Similar to example 1, white pixels need to be removed."

      - example_id: 3
        input_objects:

            type: grid

            has_white: false
            white_pixel_count: 0
        transformation: remove_white
        notes: "White pixel removal is the consistent transformation across all examples."
