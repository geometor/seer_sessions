task_description: |
  The task involves processing a grid of colored pixels. The transformation rule is to remove or filter out all pixels of a specific color, while preserving the others.
observations:
  - objects:
    - type: grid
      properties:
        - height: 29
        - width: 30
        - cells: pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors
    - type: pixel
      properties:
        - color: integer value (0-9)
        - position: (row, column)
  - actions:
    - name: remove_color
      description: Remove all pixels of a specific color from the grid.
      parameters:
        - color_to_remove: 0 (white)
  - relationships:
    - spatial: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.
    - transformation:  The output grid is derived from the input grid by removing all white pixels.
