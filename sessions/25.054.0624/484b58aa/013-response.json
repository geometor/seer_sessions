The input grid has regions of repeating patterns of digits (and therefore, colors). These repeating color patterns are arranged in 2x2 squares, and the color sequences within these 2x2 squares is \"blue, red, blue, red...\" in the even numbered rows and either \"yellow, magenta, yellow, magenta\", \"orange, azure, orange, azure\", or \"green, maroon, green maroon\" in the odd numbered rows. There's also a large central section where many of the pixels are 0 (white). The output image is identical to the input, except all of the white colored pixels are removed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
