The input and output grids have the same dimensions (21x21). The primary colors present are yellow (4), gray (5), black(0), with some scattered pixels of other colors. The dominant feature in the input appears to be a large, mostly yellow, shape resembling a face, with gray regions inside. White (0) areas seem to fill in background. In the output, the white background is removed.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
