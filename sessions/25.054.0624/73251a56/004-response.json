Identify White Regions: Locate all groups of connected white (0) pixels.\n3. Determine Enclosure: For each `white_region`,\n    - Inspect the neighbors of each white pixel.\n    - If all neighbors are either the same white pixel or a boundary of non-white, and has at least one non-white neighbor, it is determined to be enclosed by a colored region.\n4. Remove Enclosed White Regions: Change the color value of all pixels in enclosed white regions to 1 (blue) to match training output examples.\n5. Retain Other Pixels: All other pixels (non-white and white pixels not part of enclosed regions) remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"\n    Get the neighbors of a cell (including diagonals).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for i in range(max(0, row - 1), min(rows, row + 2)):\n        for j in range(max(0, col - 1), min(cols, col + 2)):\n            if (i, j) != (row, col):\n                neighbors.append((i,j))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef is_enclosed(grid, row, col, visited):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if a white region is fully enclosed by non-white pixels using flood fill.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    stack = [(row, col)]\n    enclosed = True\n    visited.add((row, col))\n\n    while stack:\n        r, c = stack.pop()\n        neighbors = get_neighbors(grid, r, c)\n        for nr, nc in neighbors:\n            if grid[nr, nc] == 0 and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                visited.add((nr, nc))\n                stack.append((nr, nc))\n            elif grid[nr,nc] == 0 and (nr,nc) in visited:\n              continue\n            elif grid[nr, nc] != 0:\n                continue\n\n    return enclosed\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by removing white pixels that are part of enclosed shapes.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    visited = set()\n\n     # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            # Check if the current cell is white (0)\n            if input_grid[row, col] == 0 and (row, col) not in visited:\n                region_visited = set()\n                if is_enclosed(input_grid, row, col, region_visited):\n                    # Remove the enclosed white region\n                    for r, c in region_visited:\n                        output_grid[r, c] = 1  # Change to 1 to match example\n                visited.update(region_visited)\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
