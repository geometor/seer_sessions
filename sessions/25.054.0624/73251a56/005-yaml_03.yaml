  - example_1:
      input:
        objects:
          - description: Multi-colored grid with various shapes and enclosed regions.
            properties:
              - colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
              - shapes: Irregular, enclosed, and open regions.
      output:
        objects:
          - description: Enclosed regions of any color are filled with blue.
            properties:
              - colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
              - shapes: Irregular, filled enclosed regions.
      transformations:
        - action: Fill enclosed regions.
          condition: Region is completely surrounded by other colors.
          result: Change color of enclosed region to blue (1).
  - example_2:
      input:
        objects:
          - description: Similar to Example 1, with different color arrangements.
            properties:
              - colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
              - shapes: Irregular, some enclosed by others.
      output:
        objects:
          - description: Enclosed regions filled with blue.
            properties:
              - colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
              - shapes: Irregular, filled enclosed regions.
      transformations:
        - action: Fill enclosed regions.
          condition: Any color region completely surrounded by different colors.
          result: Change color of enclosed region to blue (1).
  - example_3:
      input:
        objects:
          - description: Another multi-colored grid, emphasizing the need for general enclosure detection.
            properties:
              - colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
              - shapes: Irregular, enclosed regions present.
      output:
      transformations:
        - action: Fill enclosed regions.
          condition: Any color region completely surrounded by different colors.
          result: Change color of enclosed region to blue (1).
