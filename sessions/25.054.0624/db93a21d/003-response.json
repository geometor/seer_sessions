            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program correctly identified two key aspects of the transformation: preserving maroon pixels and outlining them in green where they border white pixels. However, it failed significantly in the \"create blue object\" part. The blue object's placement, size, and, in some cases, even its presence were incorrect across multiple examples.  The strategy for resolving errors will involve:\n\n1.  **Precise Blue Object Logic:** Abandon the simplistic \"bottom-right\" approach. Instead, analyze the relationship between the maroon objects, their outlines, and the placement/size of the blue object.\n2. **Consistent Green Outline**: The examples show some problems with the green outline as well.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per example):**\n\nHere's a summary, I'll consolidate observations after reporting on the individual examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Maroon Preservation: Correct.\n    *   Green Outline: Mostly correct, but missed some green pixels around the top maroon object and incorrectly placed some pixels\n    *   Blue Object: Incorrect size and placement. Should fill the space to bottom right and be outlined.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Maroon Preservation: Correct.\n    *   Green Outline: Many errors, not fully surrounding either maroon areas, and not positioned correctly\n    *   Blue Object: Incorrect size, shape, and placement. Should fill the space created by the outline and have an irregular shape.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Maroon Preservation: Correct.\n    *   Green Outline: Many errors in placement, size, shape\n    *   Blue Object: Incorrect size, shape, and placement; extends too far left, includes non-white areas.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Maroon Preservation: Correct.\n    *   Green Outline: Many errors in placement, size and shape.\n    *   Blue Object: Incorrect size, shape and placement; inconsistent and extends too far horizontally\n\n**Consolidated Observations and Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Maroon Preservation:** Consistently correct. This part of the program is fine.\n2.  **Green Outline:** The green outline is applied to *all* white pixels adjacent to maroon, but also to the boundary of the grid.\n3.  **Blue Object:** The big issue. The current method of placing blue object in bottom right of image is not supported. The blue objects appear inside a space that is enclosed, where one border is green.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: maroon_object\n    color: maroon (9)\n    properties:\n      - shape: irregular\n      - persistence: preserved\n\n  - name: green_outline\n    color: green (3)\n    properties:\n      - location: adjacent to maroon_object and white pixels and edge of grid\n\n  - name: blue_object\n    color: blue (1)\n    properties:\n      - shape: irregular, fills enclosed space\n      - location: within a space defined, in part, by the green outline\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Preserve Maroon:** Copy all maroon (9) pixels from the input to the output grid.\n2.  **Green Outline:**\n    *   Any white (0) pixel that is adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a maroon (9) pixel is changed to green (3) in the output.\n    *   Any white pixel that is adjacent to the edge of the grid is changed to green (3) in the output\n3.  **Blue Object:** Identify the spaces created enclosed by a green outline. Fill this shape with blue (1) pixels.\n\n"
