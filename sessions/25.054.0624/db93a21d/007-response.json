The primary colors involved are white (0), maroon/dark red (9), green (3), and blue (1). There are distinct maroon shapes in the input. The output seems to retain the maroon shapes but alters their surrounding context with green and blue colors. The shapes influence the colors around them. The output includes additional colors that weren't as prominent or organized in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
