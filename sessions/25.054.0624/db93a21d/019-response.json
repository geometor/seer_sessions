The primary colors involved seem to be maroon (9), white (0), green(3), blue(1). The input grid contains two distinct maroon (9) colored rectangular shapes, positioned at the top-left and bottom-right, on a white background. The output grid has changed substantially. The maroon areas maintain similar positioning but have changed colors to blue and green in different areas. The areas surrounding maroon objects also contain green and blue and the maroon shapes have become smaller inside green and blue fillings.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
