examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_size: [24, 25]
    output_size: [5, 5]
    output_colors: [0, 3]
    transformation: "Extract 5x5 subgrid from top-left. Keep white and green."
    notes: "Original hypothesis, partially correct."

  - example_id: 2
    input_size: [24, 25]
    output_size: [5, 5]
    output_colors: [6]
    transformation: "Extract 5x5 subgrid. Incorrectly keeps white and green."
    notes: "Highlights color selection error."

  - example_id: 3
    input_size: [24, 25]
    output_size: [5, 5]
    output_colors: [0, 5]
    transformation: "Extract 5x5 subgrid. Incorrectly keeps white and green."
    notes: "Confirms color selection error. Output should be gray and white."

general:
  - observation: "Output is always a 5x5 subgrid of the input."
  - observation: "The subgrid is extracted from the top-left corner."
  - observation: "The colors in the output are a subset of colors present at the top-left corner of the input, but it's NOT always white and green."
  - hypothesis: "The transformation extracts the 5x5 top-left corner subgrid, but the colors preserved varies between examples, while remaining consistent within each individual input/output mapping"
