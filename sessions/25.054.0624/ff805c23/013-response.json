The output is a significantly smaller grid, seemingly extracting a specific pattern or region from the input. The dominant colors in the input are green (3), gray (5), and white (0), with a small patch of blue (1) near the center-bottom. The output grid consists only of gray (5) and white (0) pixels. It is a 5x5 grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
