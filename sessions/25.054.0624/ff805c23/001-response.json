The output is a significantly smaller grid, seemingly derived from the upper-left corner of the input grid, specifically using only green (3) and white(0) values. The input contains red(2), blue(1), and the output doesn't. The output grid appears to be a sub-grid of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
