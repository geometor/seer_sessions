The target color may be magenta (6), green(3), or gray (5).\n2.  **Find Object Colors:** Create an initial bounding box around the identified largest object. Note all colors contained within this bounding box.\n3.  **Object Region Extraction:** Perform a flood-fill (connected component analysis) starting from a pixel within the identified object, expanding only to adjacent pixels of colors identified in step 2.\n4. **Extract Sub-grid:** Determine the minimum bounding box that fully contains the expanded region identified in Step 3. Extract this rectangular sub-grid from the input.\n5. **Simplify Colors:** Replace all pixels except the color white (0) in the extracted subgrid to the primary color, as identified in Step 1.\n6. **White Pixel Rule:** Examine the immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) of each white (0) pixel in the *original input grid*. If ALL the neighbors within the original grid are non-zero, then make that cell white, else make that cell the primary color, as identified in Step 1.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_largest_object(grid, colors):\n    \"\"\"Finds the largest contiguous block of the specified colors.\"\"\"\n    visited = set()\n    max_size = 0\n    max_coords = None\n    primary_color = None\n\n    def dfs(r, c):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not (0 <= r < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= c < grid.shape[1]) or grid[r, c] not in colors:\n            return 0, None\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        count, _ = dfs(r + 1, c)\n        c1, _ = dfs(r - 1, c)\n        c2, _ = dfs(r, c + 1)\n        c3, _ =  dfs(r, c - 1)\n        return 1 + count + c1+ c2 + c3, grid[r,c]\n\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] in colors and (r, c) not in visited:\n                size, color = dfs(r, c)\n                if size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    max_coords = (r, c)\n                    primary_color = color\n    return max_coords, max_size, primary_color\n    \ndef get_bounding_box(grid, center_coords, colors):\n    \"\"\"\n    Expands outwards from center coordinates to fully encompass\n    a contiguous shape, but only using specified colors.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    \n    min_row = center_coords[0]\n    max_row = center_coords[0]\n    min_col = center_coords[1]\n    max_col = center_coords[1]\n\n    \n    q = [center_coords]\n    seen = {center_coords}\n    \n    while q:\n        r, c = q.pop(0)\n        \n        min_row = min(min_row, r)\n        max_row = max(max_row, r)\n        min_col = min(min_col, c)\n        max_col = max(max_col, c)        \n        \n        neighbors = [(r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), (r, c-1)]\n        \n        for nr, nc in neighbors:\n            if 0<=nr<rows and 0<=nc<cols and (nr, nc) not in seen:\n                if grid[nr, nc] in colors:\n                    q.append((nr, nc))\n                    seen.add((nr, nc))\n    \n    return (min_row, min_col), (max_row, max_col)\n\ndef get_neighbor_colors(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"Returns a set of the colors of the immediate neighbors.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = [(r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), (r, c-1)]\n    neighbor_colors = set()\n    for nr, nc in neighbors:\n        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n            neighbor_colors.add(grid[nr, nc])\n    return neighbor_colors\n    \n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the described rules.\"\"\"\n    \n    # Convert input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.\n    grid = np.array(input_grid)\n\n    # 1.
