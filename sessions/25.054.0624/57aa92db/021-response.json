            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program and code captured some aspects of the transformation but failed to generalize correctly across all examples. The primary issues seem to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Green Expansion:** The green object expansion is too simple. It expands in all directions regardless of other objects.\n2.  **Incorrect Yellow Interaction:** The yellow object's interaction with red is not correctly implemented. The description assumed a diagonal fill, but the actual behavior is more complex.\n3. **Incorrect object interaction**: In several of the examples there are interactions that are not being handled correctly.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Object Identification:** Ensure the `find_objects` function correctly identifies all distinct objects, even single-pixel ones.\n2.  **Precise Interaction Rules:** Define very specific conditions for how the green and yellow objects interact with others. This includes checking for adjacency (not just general proximity) and specific colors.\n3. **Iterative Refinement**: Use information from all the examples - modify and describe the program, implement, test, evaluate.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Green 'T', Azure 'I', Yellow 'square', with blue and red pixels.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Green expands, Yellow fills an area beside it and connects diagonally.\n    *   **Actual Output:** Green expands up, down, left, and right. Yellow fills some, but not all.\n    *   **Issues:** Green expansion is too broad. Yellow filling is incorrect.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Azure, Red, Magenta, Green objects.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Green expands around the adjacent red, magenta expands.\n    *   **Actual Output:** Green only expands around itself. Magenta doesn't get filled.\n    *   **Issues:** Green expansion needs to consider adjacent colors. Magenta fill condition not understood.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    **Input**: Blue 'L', Yellow 'square', Azure 'square'.\n    *   **Expected output**: Azure expands to fill available horizontal space, yellow expands to fill available vertical space.\n    *   **Actual Output**: incorrect expansion and interaction between the yellow and azure.\n    *   **Issues**: both yellow and azure object filling is not correct.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *    **Input**: green and red pixels, azure, yellow and red squares.\n    *   **Expected output**: green expands in one direction adjacent to the red, yellow extends left and down beside and below the red.\n    *   **Actual output**: the extensions are in the incorrect place.\n    *   **Issues**: the conditions and rules for the green, yellow and red interaction are not correct.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_1:\n      objects:\n        - color: 3  # Green\n          shape: \"T-shape\"\n          action: \"Expand orthogonally adjacent to other objects\"\n        - color: 1  # Azure\n          shape: \"I-shape\"\n          action: \"Retain shape\"\n        - color: 4 #yellow\n          shape: \"Square\"\n          action: \"Expand down and to the left, filling space between it and a red object.\"\n        - color: 2  # Red\n          shape: \"pixel\"\n          action: none\n\n  - example_2:\n      objects:\n        - color: 8  # Azure\n          shape: \"Line\"\n          action: \"Retain shape\"\n        - color: 2 #red\n          shape: \"Line\"\n          action: \"Retain shape\"\n        - color: 6  # Magenta\n          shape: \"L-shape\"\n          action: \"expand to fill a square shape with a diagonal red pixel\"\n        - color: 3  # Green\n          shape: \"pixel\"\n          action: \"expand one pixel in all directions next to the red pixel\"\n\n  - example_3:\n      objects:\n        - color: 1 #blue\n          shape: \"L-shape\"\n          action: \"Retain shape\"\n        - color: 4 #yellow\n          shape: \"Square\"\n          action: \"Expand vertically and down\"\n        - color: 8  # Azure\n          shape: \"square\"\n          action: \"expand horizontally\"\n  - example_4:\n      objects:\n          - color: 3  # Green\n            shape: \"pixel\"\n            action: \"Expand orthogonally adjacent to other objects\"\n          - color: 2  # Red\n            shape: \"various\"\n            action: \"Retain shape\"\n          - color: 8  # Azure\n            shape: \"line\"\n            action: \"Retain shape\"\n          - color: 4 #yellow\n            shape: \"Square\"\n            action: \"Expand down and to the left, filling space between it and a red object.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all contiguous objects (non-white pixels) in the input grid.\n2.  **Green Expansion (Conditional):** If a green object exists, expand it by one pixel *only* in the directions where it is directly adjacent (orthogonally) to another object.\n3.  **Yellow Expansion (Conditional):** If a yellow object exists, and it's orthogonally adjacent to a red object to its immediate left, extend left by one. If adjacent and down below, expand down by one.\n4. **Magenta Expansion (Conditional)**: If a magenta object exists and there is a red pixel to the immediate NW diagonal, extend left by one and up by one.\n5.  **Azure Expansion (Conditional)**: If an azure square is detected and it has space on either of its horizontal sides, expand in both directions.\n6.  **Preservation:** All other objects retain their original shape and position.\n7.  **Background:** White pixels (0) remain unchanged unless filled by an expanding object.\n"
