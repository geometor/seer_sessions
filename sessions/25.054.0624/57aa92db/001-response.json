The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors involved appear to be green (3), blue (1), and yellow (4), with a significant presence of white/background (0). The transformation seems to involve some form of object interaction and modification, likely based on spatial relationships or contact. Specifically a yellow object appears to be growing around a blue object, while parts are removed from it.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
