"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels in the input grid. These are our initial objects.
2.  **Green Object Expansion:** The green object expands. If it exists, increase its size by one pixel in all orthogonal directions (up, down, left, right).
3. **Yellow Object Expansion:** If exists, the yellow object will check if red squares are diagonal from it. If so, extend them to down and to the left, filling the area between them.
4.  **Preserve Other Objects:**  All other non-green, non-yellow objects (in this case, the azure and red objects) retain their original shape and position in the output grid.
5.  **Background:** All other pixels (white/0) remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
