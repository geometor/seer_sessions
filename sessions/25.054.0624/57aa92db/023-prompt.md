"""
1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all contiguous objects (non-white pixels) in the input grid.
2.  **Green Expansion (Conditional):** If a green object exists, expand it by one pixel *only* in the directions where it is directly adjacent (orthogonally) to another object.
3.  **Yellow Expansion (Conditional):** If a yellow object exists, and it's orthogonally adjacent to a red object to its immediate left, extend left by one. If adjacent and down below, expand down by one.
4. **Magenta Expansion (Conditional)**: If a magenta object exists and there is a red pixel to the immediate NW diagonal, extend left by one and up by one.
5.  **Azure Expansion (Conditional)**: If an azure square is detected and it has space on either of its horizontal sides, expand in both directions.
6.  **Preservation:** All other objects retain their original shape and position.
7.  **Background:** White pixels (0) remain unchanged unless filled by an expanding object.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
