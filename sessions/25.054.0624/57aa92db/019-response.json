The colors represent digits 0-9.  The primary colors observed are white (0), green (3), red (2), azure (8), yellow (4). The input and output grids have the same dimensions. There appear to be distinct colored objects, possibly defined by contiguous blocks of the same color. Some objects expand, others stay the same, and some new components may get added.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
