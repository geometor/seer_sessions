These are our initial objects.\n2.  **Green Object Expansion:** The green object expands. If it exists, increase its size by one pixel in all orthogonal directions (up, down, left, right).\n3. **Yellow Object Expansion:** If exists, the yellow object will check if red squares are diagonal from it. If so, extend them to down and to the left, filling the area between them.\n4.  **Preserve Other Objects:**  All other non-green, non-yellow objects (in this case, the azure and red objects) retain their original shape and position in the output grid.\n5.  **Background:** All other pixels (white/0) remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous objects in a grid.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def dfs(r, c, obj_color, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not (0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols) or grid[r, c] != obj_color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            dfs(r + dr, c + dc, obj_color, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(r, c, grid[r, c], current_object)\n                objects.append((grid[r, c], current_object))  # Store color and object pixels\n    return objects\n\ndef expand_object(grid, object_pixels, color, diagonally=False):\n  \"\"\"Expands an object by one pixel in orthogonal directions.\"\"\"\n  new_pixels = set(object_pixels)\n  rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n  for r, c in object_pixels:\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                new_pixels.add((nr,nc))\n  return list(new_pixels)\n\ndef get_diagonal_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"Returns the diagonal neighbors of a cell.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr, dc in [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]:\n        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n            neighbors.append((nr, nc))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Find all objects in the input grid\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n\n    for color, obj_pixels in objects:\n        if color == 3:  # Green object\n            # expand green\n            expanded_pixels = expand_object(input_grid, obj_pixels, 3)\n            for r, c in expanded_pixels:\n                output_grid[r,c] = 3\n        elif color == 4: # Yellow Object\n            output_pixels = obj_pixels[:]\n\n            for r, c in obj_pixels:\n              # Find diagonal neighbors\n              diagonals = get_diagonal_neighbors(input_grid, r, c)\n\n              # check diagonal for red\n              for nr, nc in diagonals:\n                if input_grid[nr, nc] == 2: # check if red\n                  output_pixels.append((nr, nc))\n            \n            # Expand by one pixel to the down and to the left\n            expanded_pixels = expand_object(input_grid, output_pixels, 4, True)\n\n            # Fill the area between original yellow pixels and red pixels\n            min_r = min(r for r, _ in expanded_pixels)\n            max_r = max(r for r, _ in expanded_pixels)\n            min_c = min(c for _, c in expanded_pixels)\n            max_c = max(c for _, c in expanded_pixels)\n\n            for r in range(min_r, max_r+1):\n              for c in range(min_c, max_c+1):\n                if (r,c) in expanded_pixels:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 4\n\n        else: # Other\n            for r, c in obj_pixels:\n                output_grid[r, c] = color\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
