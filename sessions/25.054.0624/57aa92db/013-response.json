Both grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), yellow (4), and azure (8). The input grid contains two distinct colored regions: a small blue/yellow structure in the top-left and a larger azure/yellow structure in the bottom-right. The output grid seems to combine and modify these regions. The upper blue shape is unchanged. The lower shape of azure is expanded, and combines the lower shape of yellow.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

We can identify two such regions: a small blue region with a yellow pixel (shape1) and a larger azure region with a yellow region (shape2).\n\n2.  **Maintain Shape 1:** The blue and yellow object (shape1) in the top-left corner is unchanged. Keep its position, size, outline, and internal pixel arrangement.\n\n3.  **Expand and Combine Shape 2:**\n    *   Expand the borders of the azure region (shape2).\n    *   The amount of expansion is such that the new azure shape is padded with\n    empty rows and columns, with 3 empty rows above, two columns on each side, and\n    filling the 8s up to and including row 15, column 14.\n    *   Maintain the relative position of the internal yellow (4) pixels within the expanded azure region.\n\nIn essence, the transformation preserves the smaller blue/yellow structure while substantially expanding and combining the larger azure/yellow structure. The yellow pixels inside the larger structure are 'carried along' during the azure expansion.\n"
