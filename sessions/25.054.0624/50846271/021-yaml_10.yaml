examples:
  - id: 1
    cross_found: true
    azure_placement: "left and below center, but cross extends further down, and left"
    correct: false
    notes: >
        The azure pixels were placed incorrectly.
        The cross extends further down on the left side.
        The existing code doesn't seem to account for variations in how the cross shape is formed.

  - id: 2
    cross_found: true
    azure_placement: "appears within and around cross, but not consistent"
    correct: false
    notes: >
        The cross is not fully formed, yet azure fills in gaps around the red.
        It extends the red cross to full, contiguous form.
        Placement is inconsistent, but generally near.

  - id: 3
    cross_found: true
    azure_placement: "left, below, and diagonal to center"
    correct: false
    notes: >
         Azure fills in around the edges of where red pixels are.
         The cross extends further to one side.
         Azure is placed correctly in some places, but not others.

  - id: 4
    cross_found: true
    azure_placement: "below and to the right of the central red pixel"
    correct: false
    notes: >
        The initial placement rule (left and below) isn't followed.
        Placement is correct, but description is inconsistent.
