The primary colors observed are gray (5), white (0), red (2), and azure (8). The input and output grids are identical except for the introduction of azure pixels. The azure pixels appear to be related to the pre-existing red pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider contiguous regions of red pixels as single objects.\n\n2.  **Identify Target Gray Pixels:** Find gray (value 5) pixels that are cardinally adjacent (up, down, left, or right, *not* diagonally) to any red pixel.\n\n3.  **Conditional Color Change:** For each *gray* pixel from those found in step two, check the input grid. IF the *gray* pixel found in step 2 is gray, change it to azure (8) in the output grid.\n\n4. **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the input grid retain their original color in the output grid. In other words. If it is not a gray pixel next to a red pixel, as defined above, copy its value to the same coordinates in the output grid.\n"
