            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code focuses on identifying and changing *isolated* red pixels to azure. However, the examples demonstrate a more nuanced rule. It's not just about isolation; it's about the *shape* formed by the red pixels. Specifically, single red pixels and 'L' shaped groups of three red pixels, where the red pixels are continguous.\n\nThe primary strategy will be to adjust our definition of \"isolated\" to include checking not only for immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors but also for diagonal neighbors and more complex configurations, while maintaining the correct shape.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary of the provided examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Pixels off: 14\n    *   The code correctly identifies some isolated red pixels but misses a few. It also incorrectly changes some red pixels that are part of a three-pixel \"L\" shape.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Pixels off: 16\n    *   Similar issues to Example 1. The code incorrectly handles some isolated red pixels, single red pixels, and L-shaped configurations.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Pixels off: 9\n    *   Again, the code misses some isolated red pixels and incorrectly handles \"L\" shapes.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    * Pixels off: 3\n    * Same shape problem.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: red_pixel\n    properties:\n      color: red (2)\n      context: isolated or part of a line or L shape\n    actions:\n      - if: isolated\n        then: change_color_to_azure\n      - if: part of a three-pixel L shape\n        then: change the central color to azure\n      - else: remain_unchanged\n\n  - object: other_pixel\n    properties:\n      color: not red\n    actions:\n      - remain_unchanged\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Iterate through the input grid, focusing on pixels with the color red (value 2).\n\n2.  **Check for Isolation and L-shapes:** For each red pixel, determine if the red pixel has either of these properties:\n     * The red pixel does not have a direct vertical or horizontal neighbor that is also red.\n     * The red pixel has exactly two neighbors, with each neighbor a direct vertical or horizontal neighbor (i.e. an L-shape with three red pixels)\n\n3.  **Conditional Transformation:**\n    *   If a red pixel is determined to be one of these specific shapes, change its color to azure (value 8).\n    *   Otherwise, leave the red pixel's color unchanged.\n\n4.  **Other Pixels:** Pixels that are not red are left unchanged.\n"
