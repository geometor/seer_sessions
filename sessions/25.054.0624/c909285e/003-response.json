            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code identifies a repeating pattern and replaces green (3) with gray (0) within that pattern. However, it fails on all three examples. The primary issue is that it returns the *entire* input grid, instead of the repeating sub-pattern and it only considers replacing Green, but the output should reflect a substitution of the upper left corner value. The expected outputs are significantly smaller than the inputs, indicating that the core logic of extracting and returning *only* the repeating pattern is flawed. The \"replace green with gray\" part is also too specific and not universally applicable, we should focus on a color substitution based on existing colors, not on a fixed one.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Correct Pattern Extraction:** The `find_repeating_pattern` function needs to correctly *return* the smallest repeating subgrid, not the entire grid.\n2.  **Dynamic Color Replacement:** Instead of hardcoding the green-to-gray replacement, we need to identify a rule-based color replacement. By inspecting the examples, it appears the top-left pixel's color in the repeating pattern is the key. All occurrences of the top-left color in the original pattern are replaced by the color in that same top-left position *in the output grid*.\n3. **Size:** assure that the returned value is the repeating pattern, not the original grid.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection, code execution is implied):**\n\n| Example | Input Size | Output Size | Pattern Size | Top-Left Input Color | Top-Left Output Color | Colors in Pattern | Replacement Rule                               | Match |\n| :------ | :--------- | :---------- | :----------- | :------------------- | :-------------------- | :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :---- |\n| 1       | 24x26      | 7x7         | 6x7        | 0                    | 3                   | 0, 2, 4, 8, 5, 3 | 0 -> 3                                          | False |\n| 2       | 24x26      | 7x7         | 6x7          | 0                    | 2                   | 0, 8, 3, 1, 2    | 0 -> 2                                          | False |\n| 3       | 28x27      | 7x7         | 6x7          | 0                    | 6                   | 0, 3, 1, 8, 5, 6 | 0 -> 6                                          | False |\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: 002\n    examples:\n      - example_id: 1\n        input_objects:\n          - object_id: grid_1\n            type: grid\n            properties:\n              size: 24x26\n              repeating_pattern: true\n              pattern_size: 6x7\n              top_left_color: 0\n        output_objects:\n          - object_id: grid_out_1\n            type: grid\n            properties:\n              size: 7x7\n              top_left_color: 3\n        actions:\n          - action_type: replace_color\n            parameters:\n              original_color: 0\n              replacement_color: 3\n      - example_id: 2\n        input_objects:\n          - object_id: grid_2\n            type: grid\n            properties:\n              size: 24x26\n              repeating_pattern: true\n              pattern_size: 6x7\n              top_left_color: 0\n        output_objects:\n          - object_id: grid_out_2\n            type: grid\n            properties:\n              size: 7x7\n              top_left_color: 2\n        actions:\n          - action_type: replace_color\n            parameters:\n              original_color: 0\n              replacement_color: 2\n      - example_id: 3\n        input_objects:\n          - object_id: grid_3\n            type: grid\n            properties:\n              size: 28x27\n              repeating_pattern: true\n              pattern_size: 6x7\n              top_left_color: 0\n        output_objects:\n          - object_id: grid_out_3\n            type: grid\n            properties:\n              size: 7x7\n              top_left_color: 6\n        actions:\n          - action_type: replace_color\n            parameters:\n              original_color: 0\n              replacement_color: 6\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Repeating Pattern:** Find the smallest rectangular subgrid that repeats both horizontally and vertically to fully cover the input grid.\n2.  **Extract Pattern:** Isolate one instance of this repeating subgrid.\n3.  **Identify Top-Left Colors:** Note the color of the top-left pixel in the *input* pattern and the top-left color in the *output* pattern.\n4. **Color Replacement.** Within the extracted pattern, replace all instances of the original top-left color with the output top-left color.\n5.  **Output:** The modified subgrid is the output.\n"
