            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy of finding a specific row (\"0 1 3 8 0\") and extracting a bordered region around it has fundamental flaws. It fails completely on Examples 2, and produces an empty grid and completely incorrect match for Example 3. The assumption that this specific row is *always* present and that a fixed-color border surrounds the target area is incorrect. The color substitution (5 to 6) works in the third example where conditions coincidentally align, but the overall approach to finding the output area is wrong.\n\nThe strategy needs to shift from finding a specific *sequence* to identifying a *repeating pattern* within a *bordered region*. The border is a consistent feature, and acts as a deliminter to a section. The content *within* the border appears to be what is copied to create the output.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Border Detection:** Instead of searching for a specific row sequence, focus on reliably detecting the single-color border that surrounds the region of interest. This border can vary in color between examples (2, 8, and 5 in the examples).\n2.  **Extract Inner Region:** Once the border is found, extract the rectangular region *inside* the border.\n3. **Analyze inner contents** Use the inner region to locate repeating patterns of pixels and color change values.\n4.  **Conditional Color Substitution:**  Maintain the color substitution rule, but make it conditional.  It doesn't *always* happen. We need a reliable trigger for it.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including the metrics and observations. I will manually describe them since I don't have code execution capabilities here.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input Size:** 24x25\n*   **Expected Output Size:** 7x7\n*   **Border Color:** Varies (5, then 3)\n*   **Color Substitution:** No\n*   **Result:** `transform` function returned `None`. Complete failure.\n* **Objects**: Border object that surrounds an inner rectangular grid object.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input Size:** 26x25\n*   **Expected Output Size:** 7x7\n*   **Border Color:** Varies (8, then 2)\n*   **Color Substitution:** No\n*   **Result:** `transform` function returned `None`. Complete failure.\n* **Objects**: Border object that surrounds an inner rectangular grid object.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input Size:** 28x31\n*   **Expected Output Size:** 7x7\n*   **Border Color:** Varies (5, then 6)\n*   **Color Substitution:** Yes (5 becomes 6)\n*   **Result:** Empty output, wrong size, but the color substitution *did* occur in the attempted (but failed) extraction.\n* **Objects**: Border object that surrounds an inner rectangular grid object.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    border_colors: [5, 3]\n    color_substitution: false\n    objects:\n      - type: border\n        shape: rectangle\n      - type: inner_grid\n        shape: rectangle\n        relation: contained_by_border\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    border_colors: [8, 2]\n    color_substitution: false\n    objects:\n      - type: border\n        shape: rectangle\n      - type: inner_grid\n        shape: rectangle\n        relation: contained_by_border\n\n  - example_id: 3\n    border_colors: [5, 6]\n    color_substitution: true\n    substitution_rule: {from: 5, to: 6}\n    objects:\n      - type: border\n        shape: rectangle\n      - type: inner_grid\n        shape: rectangle\n        relation: contained_by_border\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find the Border:** Scan the input grid to identify a rectangular border. The border is defined as a contiguous region of a single color that completely encloses an inner rectangular area. The border may have different colors on the inner and outer edges, or have more than one row or column making it thicker.\n2.  **Extract Inner Region:** Once the border is identified, extract the rectangular region located *inside* the border. This inner region is the area of interest.\n3.  **Conditional Color Substitution:** Examine the *input* grid. If color 5 is adjacent to the *outer* border color anywhere, replace all instances of color 5 with color 6 *within the extracted inner region*.\n4. **Output:** The transformed \"inner region\" from step 3 becomes the output grid.\n"
