The primary colors observed are azure (8), white (0), and green (3). The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid, with some areas of azure (8) pixels replaced by green (3) pixels. The shape formed by the green pixels resembles a plus sign or a cross.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"

The dimensions and thickness of the cross might have specific calculations, but it's based on filling green (3) onto the grid.\n\nIn short, the transformation replaces a centered, cross-shaped section of the azure background with green pixels. The remaining parts of the grid keep original colors and structure.\n"
