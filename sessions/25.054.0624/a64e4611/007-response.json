Both grids are 30x30 and contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors observed are blue (1), white (0), and green (3) in the output. The input grid consists of seemingly random arrangements of blue (1) and white (0) pixels. The output grid introduces a large rectangular block of green (3) pixels replacing a large area of what were previously mixed blue and white pixels in the input, and keeps the blue and white parts of the input untouched.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
