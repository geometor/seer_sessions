The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), and red (2). The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a complex interaction between the azure and red objects, where the azure pixels are maintained, but the red pixels seem to be moved or alternated.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

In the output, change the position of the '2' pixel based on it's column and row.\n    *   If the row is 2 or 15, change pixels in column 4 and 7 to red.\n    *   For every other horizontal line of red in the input, maintain every other horizontal red pixel.\n\nThis program captures the core logic: preserving the azure and selectively modifying the red region based on a alternating pattern.\n"
