examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_grid_size: [19, 13]
    output_grid_size: [19, 13]
    input_colors: [0, 2, 8]
    output_colors: [0, 2, 8]
    transform_match: False
    pixels_off: 65
    notes: >
      The initial code failed to correctly mirror the red '2' pixels across the central
      azure '8' object and its horizontal line. Also, added red '2' to the edge on row 7.
      The approach of extending lines with yellow '4' is completely wrong.
  - example_id: 2
    input_grid_size: [17, 17]
    output_grid_size: [17, 17]
    input_colors: [0, 1, 4]
    output_colors: [0, 1, 4]
    transform_match: False
    pixels_off: 63
    notes: >
        The transformation involves both mirroring the '4' pixels above and below the
        central blue '1' structure, and some form of edge modification involving the
        '4' pixels. Yellow '4' is also added on row 8, columns 1,2,14,15,16.
  - example_id: 3
    input_grid_size: [16, 18]
    output_grid_size: [16, 18]
    input_colors: [0, 2, 3]
    output_colors: [0, 2, 3]
    transform_match: False
    pixels_off: 57
    notes: >
      Mirroring of '3' pixels seems to occur across the long axis of a shape of 2's.
      The code added some yellow incorrectly. Also, added maroon '3' to the edge on
      row 9.
