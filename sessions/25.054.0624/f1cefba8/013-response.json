The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), and green (3). The input appears to be a solid rectangle of red (2) containing an inner rectangle of green (3). The overall shape resembles an apple. The transformation seems to involve a complex modification to the inner green object and a 'creeping' green pixel.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Change that red pixel to green.
