            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the results, and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code, while capturing some aspects of the transformation (like identifying objects and preserving azure pixels), fails to correctly implement the core logic of alternating color replacement and border handling. The errors are significant, with a large number of mismatched pixels in each test case.  The strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Re-examining the Core Rule:**  The alternating pattern and its relation to different colored objects and their neighbors is not correctly understood. We need to revisit the examples and derive a more precise rule description. The concept of \"border\" needs clarification.\n2.  **Simplifying Object Handling:** The current object handling and border detection seem overly complex, making debugging and modification difficult.\n3.  **Focusing on Relative Positioning:** The correct outputs show a clear dependence on the relative position of pixels *within* each object and in relation to neighboring objects.  The current code doesn't effectively capture this.\n4. **Improving border color handling:** The logic on which color should be at the border is not working, it should copy the adjacent neighbor color, unless no neighbor.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a summary of what we can derive from provided results, using the images as support.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: A large azure (8) rectangle surrounding a smaller red (2) rectangle.\n    *   Expected Output: The red rectangle alternates colors internally between red and white, with a red border. The azure rectangle is preserved.\n    *   Actual Output: Incorrect alternating pattern and border inside of the red rectangle.\n    *   Key Observation: The alternating pattern seems to be based on a checkerboard-like grid *within* the object, and border should copy the color of the adjacent object.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Two overlapping rectangles: blue (1) and yellow (4).\n    *   Expected Output: The overlapping area forms a complex pattern, parts of the yellow section become a checkerboard, some of the blue becomes a checkerboard. There is a line of yellow and 4's along the line separating the regions.\n    *   Actual Output: Almost entirely wrong, very few pixels are correct.\n    *   Key Observation: The overlapping area and adjacent color handling is critical and completely missed.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: Two adjacent, irregular shapes of red (2) and green (3).\n    *   Expected Output: A complex interaction, with the green object affecting the red, and vice-versa, with an alternating pattern.\n    *   Actual Output: Incorrect, only applies checkerboard, misses the influence on neighbors.\n    *   Key Observation: Adjacency of *different* colors is crucial, and the transformation depends on this adjacency.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts and Properties**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: 8  # Azure\n    behavior: preserve\n    instances:\n      - shape: rectangle\n        coords: [(2,1) -> (14,12)] # Example 1, approximate\n  - color: 2  # Red\n    behavior: alternating_pattern, affected_by_neighbors\n    instances:\n      - shape: rectangle\n        coords: [(4,3) -> (12,10)] # Example 1, approximate\n  - color: 1  # Blue\n    behavior: alternating_pattern, affected_by_neighbors\n    instances:\n       - shape: rectangle\n         coords: [(4,2) -> (11,13)] # Example 2\n  - color: 4  # Yellow\n    behavior: alternating_pattern, affected_by_neighbors\n    instances:\n      - shape: rectangle\n        coords: [(5,4) -> (10, 11)] # Example 2\n  - color: 3 # Green\n    behavior: alternating_pattern, affected_by_neighbors\n    instances:\n      - shape: irregular\n        coords: [(4, 5) -> (12,13)] # Example 3\nactions:\n  - type: preserve\n    target:\n      color: 8\n  - type: alternating_color\n    target:\n      colors: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    rules:\n      - condition: adjacent_to_different_color\n        result: border_takes_neighbor_color\n      - condition: inside_object\n        result: checkerboard_pattern\n      - condition: no_neighbor\n        result: checkerboard_pattern\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of the same color, excluding white (0).\n\n2.  **Preserve Azure:**  Leave all azure (8) pixels unchanged.\n\n3.  **Process Other Colors:** For all other colors (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.):\n    *   **Border Handling:**\n        *   If a pixel of the object is adjacent (including diagonals) to a pixel of a *different* color, change the pixel to the adjacent color, unless that color is 0 or 8, in which case set to 0.\n    *   **Interior Alternating Pattern (Checkerboard):**\n        *   For pixels *not* on the border, apply an alternating pattern based on their row and column indices *relative to the top-left corner of the object's bounding box*. The pattern follows a \"checkerboard\" style:\n        *   If (row + col) is even: Keep the original color.\n        *   If (row + col) is odd: change to white (0)\n\n4. **Border Priority:** Border handling takes precedence. The checkerboard pattern is applied *only* to internal object pixels after borders are determined.\n\n**Next Steps**\nThe provided assessment, YAML block, and the natural language program, will serve as documentation to develop a new version of the python function.\n"
