1.  **Identify the "hole"**: Locate the empty (value 0) region within the red (value 2) shape in the input grid. This is the internal space that is not part of the red square's perimeter. It can consist of one or several 0 pixels.
2.  **Find the vertical center**: The new pixels are vertically centered.
3. **Place Green Pixels**: In the output, the center of the hole is made of two green pixels stacked on top of one another. All the red pixels are turned to white pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
