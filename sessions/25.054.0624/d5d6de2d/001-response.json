Both grids are 10x10 and contain numerical values representing colors. The input grid has two distinct shapes formed by the color red (value 2) against a background of white (value 0). The output grid has corresponding shapes of green (value 3) in the same locations, but the shape appears to be reduced and possibly a subset of the input shapes.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
