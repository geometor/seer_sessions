Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies the "hole" within a red shape and attempts to place green pixels. However, it makes several incorrect assumptions:

1.  It assumes there's only one hole.
2.  It assumes the hole is always a single pixel.
3.  It assumes two green pixels are always placed, vertically stacked.
4. It assumes the shape is on the edge of the image
5. It doesn't replace the red pixels to white

The strategy to resolve these errors is to:

1.  Generalize the hole detection to handle multi-pixel holes.
2.  Correctly identify the center of a multi-pixel hole.
3.  Place the correct number of green pixels horizontally in all cases.
4.  Fill the bounding box with white
5. Consider all red shapes

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has two red shapes, each with a single-pixel hole.
    *   The code only processes the first hole it finds (top-left).
    *   It places two green pixels vertically.
    *   The output is incorrect because it misses the second hole and misplaces green pixels and doesn't replace the red.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has one red shape with a single-pixel hole.
    *   The code finds the hole correctly.
    *   It places two green pixels vertically.
    *   The output places the green in the correct location, but there should only be two green pixels.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input has one red shape and a multi-pixel (3x3) hole.
    *   The code only detects one pixel in the corner of the hole.
    *   It places only two green, vertically.
    *   The placement is incorrect, and the size of green shape is wrong and doesn't replace the red.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Shapes and Their Holes**: Find all contiguous red (value 2) shapes in the input grid. For each red shape, locate the internal "hole," which is a contiguous region of white (value 0) pixels completely enclosed by the red shape. Holes can be of any size (1x1, 3x3, or other dimensions).

2.  **Find the Hole Center**: Calculate the center coordinates of each hole. The center is determined by finding the center row. The columns are the range of columns the hole occupies.

3.  **Create Green Line**: For each hole, replace all of the white pixels with a horizontal line of green (value 3) pixels.

4. **Remove Red**: Change all red pixels in the input to white in the output.

5.  **Preserve other parts:** If any parts of the input are not red or the "hole" inside the red, then those pixels should be value 0 in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
