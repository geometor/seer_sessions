            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed updates to the natural language program and strategy.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code captures some key aspects of the transformation, specifically:\n\n*   **Object Identification:** The `find_objects` function correctly identifies contiguous blocks of pixels as distinct objects.\n*   **Green Pixel Replication:** The `replicate_green_horizontal_alternate` function implements the horizontal replication of green pixels with alternating blank spaces, but errors exist in blank space location.\n*    **Red Rectangle Replication:** The `replicate_red_vertical_alternate_hollow` implements replication, but errors exist in replication.\n\nHowever, the code has significant shortcomings:\n\n*   **Incomplete Replication Logic:** The code only handles green and red objects and does not generalize to other colors. It doesn't handle variations in replication patterns (e.g., diagonal, specific shapes).\n*   **Incorrect Transformations:** All of the examples failed.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze All Examples:** Carefully examine *all* provided examples, not just the first one, to identify the complete set of transformation rules. Pay very close attention to any patterns that are related.\n2.  **Refine Object Properties:** Extend the object identification process to include not just location, but also shape, size, and relative position.\n3.  **Generalized Replication:** Develop a more general replication mechanism that can handle different directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) and patterns.\n4.  **Conditional Logic:** Implement conditional logic to determine which transformation rule to apply to each object based on its properties.\n5. **Iterate** - focus on developing the simplest functions possible that demonstrate at least some of the key features of the example.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of each example.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** Azure rectangle, Green pixels, Red rectangle.\n*   **Expected Output:** Green pixels replicated horizontally with alternating blank spaces. Red rectangle replicated vertically with alternating full and hollow versions.\n*   **Actual Output:** Green replication is not completely correct (spacing wrong). Red replication is also incorrect.\n* **Metrics:**\n    ```\n    pixels_off: 28\n    size_correct: True\n    color_palette_correct: True\n    correct_pixel_counts: False\n    ```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** Yellow, Blue, Red and Green Pixels\n*   **Expected Output:** Red Pixel creates solid rectangle, Green Pixel replicates, Yellow and Blue create a complex diagonal shape.\n*   **Actual Output:** Replication is incorrect\n* **Metrics:**\n    ```\n    pixels_off: 41\n    size_correct: True\n    color_palette_correct: True\n    correct_pixel_counts: False\n    ```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:** Magenta, Gray, and Blue shapes.\n*   **Expected Output:** Magenta and Blue shapes replicate in a diagonal pattern.\n*   **Actual Output:** No replication of any kind.\n* **Metrics:**\n    ```\n    pixels_off: 21\n    size_correct: True\n    color_palette_correct: True\n    correct_pixel_counts: False\n    ```\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: 8 # Azure\n    type: rectangle\n    action: none # Remains unchanged\n  - color: 3 # Green\n    type: pixel\n    action: replicate_horizontal_alternate\n    pattern:\n      - color: 3\n      - color: 0\n  - color: 2 # Red\n    type: rectangle\n    action: replicate_vertical_alternate\n    pattern:\n      - type: full\n      - type: hollow\n  - color: 4 # Yellow\n    type: pixel\n    action: combine_and_replicate\n  - color: 1 # Blue\n    type: pixel, rectangle\n    action: combine_and_replicate\n  - color: 6 # Magenta\n    type: shape\n    action: combine_and_replicate\n  - color: 5 # Gray\n    type: shape\n    action: none\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Revised):**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.\n2.  **Azure Rectangle:** Azure rectangles remain unchanged.\n3.  **Green Pixel:** Each green pixel is replicated horizontally to the right edge of the grid. The replication alternates between a green pixel and a blank space (color 0). The green pixel comes first.\n4.  **Red Rectangle:** Each red rectangle is replicated vertically downwards. The replication alternates between a full rectangle and a hollow version. The hollow version has the same bounding box, but the center pixels are set to color 0 (blank). The full rectangle comes first.\n5.  **Yellow and Blue Pixels and Rectangles:**\n   - find the bounding box that contains all yellow and blue objects.\n   - replicate yellow and blue, alternating, in a complex diagonal shape until the bounding box is filled.\n   - if a blue rectangle exists, replicate it vertically downward, inserting an empty row between.\n6.  **Magenta Shapes:** Replicate diagonally.\n7. **Gray Shapes:** Gray objects remain unchanged.\n"
