There are distinct colored objects (non-white pixels) within the grid. The transformation seems to involve a duplication or mirroring of certain colored objects, with some spatial translation. The gray (5) object seems unaffected. It is an object replication task where select objects based on their color are replicated and repositioned relative to their initial position.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The object with gray (5) color should be ignored.\n4.  **Replicate and Translate Magenta (6) objects:**\n    *   For each magenta object, create a copy.\n    *   The position is variable, and depedends on the position relative to the center:\n        *  If the object is on the 1st row (y=0) and 6 spaces to the left or to the right of the center column, insert another magenta pixel at that position.\n        *  If the object is on the 1st row (y=0) and 5 spaces to the left or to the right of the center column, insert two magenta pixels in a row at that position.\n        * If the magenta pixel is in the first quadrant, move its copy one step diagonally (top right).\n        * If the magenta pixel is in the second quadrant, move its copy one step to the left.\n        * If the magenta pixel is in the third quadrant, remain the pixel in the original position.\n        * If the magenta pixel is in the forth quadrant, move its copy one step down.\n5.  **Replicate and Translate Blue (1) Objects:**\n    *   For each blue object, create a copy.\n    *  The position is variable, and depedends on the position relative to the bottom:\n        * If the object is on the last row (y=H-1) and one space up, shift it one step to the left.\n        * If the object is on the last row (y=H-1) and two spaces up, insert another blue pixel at that position.\n        * If the object is 5 spaces up from the last row, insert two blue pixels on top of each other.\n        * If the object is 6 spaces up from the last row, shift it one row down and one column to the right.\n        * If the blue pixel is in other positions, keep the original position.\n6.  **Gray (5) Objects unchanged:** The gray object doesn't change position or replicate.\n7. **Output:** The output will keep every pixel (including white pixels) and the replicated pixels from previous steps.\n\n"
