The input grid contains a cross-like shape formed by blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4) pixels, all on a background of white (0) pixels. The output grid modifies this cross. It expands the yellow pixels, changes the arrangement of red pixels, and maintains the blue pixels' positions (although their function changes in relation to the red pixels). A key observation is the apparent \"reflection\" or mirroring of certain elements and extending existing shapes.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This serves as a central structure.\n2.  **Yellow Expansion:** Expand the yellow (4) pixels. Each single yellow pixel becomes a horizontal line of three yellow pixels, centered on the original yellow pixel's location.\n3.  **Blue Axis:** The position of the blue pixles doesn't change.\n4. **Red Expansion:** Expand the red (2) pixels. The single red pixel expands to become a vertical and a horizontal line, using the original red pixel position as their meeting point, and adjacent to the sides of the original blue pixels.\n\nIn essence, the transformation involves expanding the yellow and red elements around a central, unchanged set of blue pixels. The expansions are influenced by adjacency and the relative positions of the colors.\n"
