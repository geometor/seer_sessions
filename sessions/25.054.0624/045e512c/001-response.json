The primary colors involved appear to be azure (8), green (3), and red (2), all on a background of white (0). The input grid contains distinct shapes formed by these colors. The transformation seems to involve replicating and potentially repositioning or altering these shapes, specifically concerning the green and red elements. The azure shape appears to serve as a reference or is somehow excluded from a specific operation that is applied to others.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Each cell will contain '3', such that new pattern is 3,0,3,0,3,0,...\n3.  **Replicate Red:** Replicate the red rectangle vertically downwards multiple times. Every other red shape should have the middle red pixel removed and be replaced with a white pixel (0).\n4.  **Preserve Azure Shape:** Ensure the process leaves the original azure object at its original position.\n\n"
