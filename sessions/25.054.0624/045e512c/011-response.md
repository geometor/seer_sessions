Here's an analysis of the provided examples and the code's performance, along with a revised natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial strategy of identifying a blue line and expanding other colors around it has fundamental flaws, highlighted by the mismatches in all three test examples. The core issue is that the blue line concept is neither consistently present nor correctly interpreted. The expansion logic is also misapplied, as it expands all around non-blue non-black pixels, not just vertically. The correct transformation involves identifying individual, isolated non-black pixels and drawing either vertical or horizontal lines, depending on their neighbors. The code needs to recognize the primary objects, the creation of the secondary objects, and the positioning of the secondary objects with respect to the primary objects.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including observations and metrics, using the previous code execution results:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** Contains isolated azure (8), green (3) and red (2) pixels.
    *   **Expected Output:** Vertical line from the azure, horizontal line from the green, and vertical line from the red pixels.
    *   **Code Output:** Incorrectly expands around some colors, misses placement, and incorrectly expands horizontally.
    *   **Pixels Off:** 65
    * **Observations:** Code is not handling isolated pixels correctly.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** Contains isolated yellow (4) and red (2) pixels, with some blue (1) pixels.
    *   **Expected Output:** Horizontal line for the yellow, vertical line for the red.
    *   **Code Output:** Similar errors to Example 1, misinterpreting the roles of individual pixels.
    *  **Pixels Off:** 42
      * **Observations:** Fails to handle isolated pixels correctly. Horizontal and vertical lines are drawn incorrectly.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:** Contains isolated magenta (6) and gray (5) pixels, along with a contiguous block of blue pixels.
    *   **Expected Output:** Horizontal lines for both magenta and gray.
    *   **Code Output:** Incorrect expansion and placement
      *   **Pixels Off:** 49
        * **Observations:** Horizontal line logic partially correct.
**YAML Block**

```yaml
objects:
  primary:
    - type: pixel
      properties:
        color: non-black, non-zero
        isolated: true  # Indicates if the pixel is not directly adjacent to another pixel of the same color
  secondary:
      - type: line
        properties:
          orientation: ["horizontal", "vertical"]
          color: same as primary pixel
          length: 3

rules:
  - condition: primary pixel has no immediate same-color neighbors horizontally
    action: create secondary object, vertical line, centered on primary pixel
  - condition: primary pixel has no immediate same-color neighbors vertically
    action: create secondary object, horizontal line, centered on primary pixel

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Primary Objects:** Find all non-black pixels. These are the primary objects.

2.  **Determine Isolation:** For each primary object (pixel), check if it has any directly adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, or right) of the same color.

3.  **Create Secondary Object (Line):**
    *   If there is an immediate same color horizontal neighbor, draw a vertical line, color of the primary object, centered on the source pixel.
    *   If there is an immediate same color vertical neighbor, draw a horizontal line, color of the primary object, centered on the source pixel.
    *  If there are no same color horizontal or vertical neighbors, the draw either a horizontal or vertical line.
    *   A single pixel will produce *either* a horizontal *or* a vertical line.

4. **Line characteristics:** All lines created will be 3 pixels in length, centered at the original primary pixel.
