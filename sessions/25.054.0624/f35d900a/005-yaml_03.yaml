task_description: >-
  Expand non-white pixels into 3x3 blocks, 
  handling overlaps with gray color.

observations:
  - object_type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)
    actions:
      expand: Create a 3x3 block of the same color.
      overlap: If expanded blocks overlap, change color to gray (5).

  - object_type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: (rows, columns)
    actions:
      initialize: Set all pixels to white (0).
      transform: Apply expansion and overlap rules.

  - process: iterative
    details: process pixels in input grid by row order from top left to bottom right.
