Okay, let's analyze this example and try to figure out the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 17x14 grid with mostly 'white' (0) pixels. There are two distinct objects: a 'blue' (1) pixel and an 'azure' (8) pixel, mirrored across the horizontal center.
*   **Output:** A 17x14 grid. It seems to maintain the mirrored symmetry of the input, but with significant changes:
    *   The original 'blue' and 'azure' pixels are still present but have "expanded" horizontally into 3x1 blocks.
    *   These blocks have also "expanded" vertically, taking the spaces directly above and below, now having made a 3x3 block each
    *    Between these two main blocks of blue and azure, a 'gray' (5) pixel appears on the central horizontal. Also between each pair of the extended 3 x 3 block.
    *   The original 'blue' (1) and 'azure' (8) pixels have swapped positions within their 3 x 3 blocks, across a row and across the central vertical.
    *    There are now three additional grey '5' pixels on the central horizontal
*   **Overall:** The transformation involves mirroring, expansion, swapping, and the introduction of new 'gray' pixels based on the positions of the original colored pixels.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Initial Objects:** Locate the 'blue' (1) and 'azure' (8) pixels in the input grid. Also identify the two mirrored objects, blue and azure across the horizontal.

2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** Expand each of the identified pixels horizontally to create 3x1 blocks of the same color.

3.  **Vertical Expansion:** Expand each of the four 3 x 1 blocks vertically by taking the row directly above, and the row directly below, each creating 3 x 3 blocks.

4.  **Position Swap:** Swap positions between the blue and azure pixel colors within the two expanded blocks. The pixel that was in the upper-left corner, for example, goes to the bottom right.

5. **Introduce Gray Pixels:**
     * Place gray pixels between the 3x3 blue and azure blocks, from edge to edge.
      * Introduce 'gray' (5) pixels above, below, and between the expanded blocks in the central horizontal line.

6. **Mirroring**: Ensure that the final result is mirrored on the horizontal axis.
