      Expand each non-white colored pixel into a 3x3 block of the same color.
      If the expanded blocks overlap, the overlapping pixels become gray (5).
  - objects:
      - description: Non-white pixels in the input grid.
        properties:
          color: Varies (not 0/white).
          shape: Initially a single pixel.
          expansion: Becomes a 3x3 block of the same color.
      - description: Overlapping regions of expanded blocks.
        properties:
          color: Gray (5).
          shape: Determined by the intersection of expanded regions.
  - actions:
      - name: Expand
        description: Create a 3x3 block centered on the original pixel, using the pixel's original color. Stop expansion if the blocks would exceed the sides of the grid.
      - name: Overlap
        description: Where expanded 3x3 regions from different colored pixels overlap, replace those pixels with gray (5).
      - name: maintain_background
        description: Ensure non expanded, non-overlapping colors pixels remain white
