1.  **Initial Placement and Mirroring**: Copy each non-white pixel from the input grid to four corresponding positions in the output grid: the original position, its horizontal mirror, its vertical mirror, and its mirror across both axes. If any mirroring causes an overlap, place the colored pixel value once.
2.  **Color Expansion**: After *all* initial non-white pixels have been placed and mirrored:
    *   Expand red (2) pixels to all directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (0) pixels.
    *   Expand yellow (4) pixels to all directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (0) pixels.
    *   Expand green(3) pixels to all directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) white(0) pixels.
    *    Expand azure(8) pixels to all directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) white(0) pixels.
3.  **Gray Filling**: After color expansion, for each remaining white (0) pixel in the output grid:
    *   Check if it is directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to at least two pixels of *different* non-white colors.
    *   If so, replace the white pixel with gray (5).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
