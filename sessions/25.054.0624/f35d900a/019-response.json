These objects are single pixels in the input. The output grid expands these single-pixel objects into 3x3 squares of the same color. There is a gray (5) horizontal line pattern where every other element of input line is mirrored to the output line in the output grid. Also, adjacent green and azure pixels are connected by drawing a line between them.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The original pixel should be the center of the new 3x3 square.\n3. **Connect Objects with Gray Lines:** Find pairs of 3x3 colored squares that are close to each other (in this case, green and azure squares). Draw gray (5) colored one pixel wide horizontal lines between them. The line is drawn such that every other pixel on the input line is mirrored to a corresponding pixel on the output line. The lines should start in the middle row and middle column of each square.\n\n"
