Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The code has several issues, as evidenced by the errors and mismatches in the test results. The primary problems seem to be:

1.  **Index Out of Range Errors:** Occur in examples 1, 3 and 4. Likely due to incorrect handling of boundary conditions during pixel expansion or color swapping, especially when dealing with mirrored positions, or the lists of pixels by color are empty.
2.  **Incorrect Pixel Placement:** Example 2 shows a significant number of `pixels_off`, indicating that the expansion, mirroring, or swapping logic is flawed. The gray pixel introduction also seems incorrect.
3. mirror locations are not correctly being accounted for in the gray pixel additions

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Handle Edge Cases:** Carefully review the code, especially the `expand_horizontally`, `expand_block_vertically`, `swap_colors_in_block` and `introduce_gray_pixels`, to ensure they correctly handle edge cases (pixels at or near the grid boundaries). Use more robust boundary checks using `max(0, ...)` and `min(grid.shape[...], ...)` to avoid index errors. Check for existance of the color pixels before using coordinates
2.  **Verify Mirroring Logic:** Double-check the mirroring calculations to ensure they accurately reflect the intended symmetry. Visualize the expected mirrored positions and compare them with the code's output.
3.  **Refine Color Swapping:** The `swap_colors_in_block` function might be swapping colors incorrectly or in the wrong blocks. Make sure you're selecting block correctly.
4.  **Gray Pixel Logic**: The gray pixel introduction needs to consider the mirroring and correctly place pixels between the expanded blocks, and adjacent.

**Metrics and Observations:**

I will build some reports using jupyter notebook and the `code_execution` tool to understand the source of the errors.

find_pixels_by_color = lambda grid, color: np.array(np.where(grid == color)).T.tolist()

blue_pixels = find_pixels_by_color(input_grid, 1)
azure_pixels = find_pixels_by_color(input_grid, 8)
print(f"Blue Pixels: {blue_pixels}")
print(f"Azure Pixels: {azure_pixels}")

#Error is raised because transform is accessing the first value from blue_pixels
# and azure_pixels, but those lists are empty. The code assumes there will be
# values but in this case and others, there are not, so the code should check first

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all 'blue' (1) and 'azure' (8) pixels within the input grid. Also compute their mirrored positions across both the horizontal and vertical center lines of the grid.

2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For every original and mirrored blue/azure pixel, expand it horizontally into a 3x1 block of the same color centered on the original pixel's column.

3.  **Vertical Expansion:** Expand each 3x1 block (both original and mirrored) into a 3x3 block of the same color, centered on the original 3x1 block.

4. **Color Swap:**  Within each 3x3 block (original and mirrored), swap all the 'blue' pixels with 'azure' pixels and vice-versa.

5.  **Add Gray Separators (Horizontal):** Add a horizontal line of 'gray' (5) pixels between the expanded blocks, along the center row of the expanded blocks.

6.  **Add Gray Separators (Vertical):** If there are any empty spaces ('white' (0)) vertically adjacent to the central expanded pixels, fill these with 'gray' (5).

7. Check the existance of blue and azure colors before operating on their pixel positions.

The key improvements in this revised program are the explicit consideration of mirroring in all steps, the clarification of the color swapping within the expanded blocks, explicit instructions about adding the grey pixels and checking color pixels for existance.
