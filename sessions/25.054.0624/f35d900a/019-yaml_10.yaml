objects:
  - id: 1
    color: green (3)
    initial_shape: single pixel
    initial_position: [4, 4]
    final_shape: 3x3 square
    final_position: centered on initial position

  - id: 2
    color: azure (8)
    initial_shape: single pixel
    initial_position: [4, 12]
    final_shape: 3x3 square
    final_position: centered on initial position

  - id: 3
    color: gray(5)
    initial_shape: none
    final_shape: lines
    connections:
      - between green and azure squares, with a 1-pixel buffer

relationships:
  - spatial: objects 1 and 2 are initially separated.
  - transformation:  Each colored pixel expands into a 3x3 square of the same color.
  - connectivity: Gray lines connect areas around the expanded objects.

actions:
    - type: expansion
      target: single-pixel objects (green and azure)
      result: 3x3 squares

    - type: draw
      target:  Areas around azure and green
      result: gray lines in between
