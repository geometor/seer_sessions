The transformation seems to involve creating a symmetrical pattern, expanding, and introducing a new color (gray=5). The output grid mirrors the layout and colors of the input grid, but introduces a gray color where a colored pixel is adjacent to another colored pixel. The main challenge is to identify adjacency and color replacement rule.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Otherwise, keep the current value of the pixel.\n3. If the cell is not white and has not been changed to gray, maintain its input color in the output grid.\n\nEssentially, the transformation preserves the initial colored cells positions, expands them and adds gray color where different colors are adjacent.\n"
