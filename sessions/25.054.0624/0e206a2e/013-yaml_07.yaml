facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains single pixels of colors blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4), 
      and a cluster of azure (8) pixels.
  - object_identification:
      - object: blue pixel
        properties:
          color: blue (1)
          initial_position: (12, 1)
          final_position: (12,1)
      - object: red pixel
        properties:
          color: red (2)
          initial_position: (12, 5)
          final_position: (12,5)
      - object: yellow pixel
        properties:
           color: yellow (4)
           initial_position: row 3, column 9, and row 14, column 5
           final_position: row 14, column 5
      - object: azure cluster
        properties:
          color: azure (8)
          initial_position: around (4, 5), and (4,9)
          final_position: around (12, 2), and (13,2)
  - transformation: |
      The azure (8) cluster appears to shift downwards and the other color stay the same,
      except for yellow at (3,9) which is deleted.
  - constraints:
      - Grid dimensions remain constant (16x14).
      - Colors of moved pixels are preserved.
      - the yellow (4) stays where it is or it is deleted.
  - relationships:
    - the azure (8) at (4,9) moves close the yellow (4) at (3,9) which triggers its deletion
