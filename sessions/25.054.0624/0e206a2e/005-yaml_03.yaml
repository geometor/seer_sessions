objects:
  - description: "Contiguous regions of non-white pixels."
    properties:
      - color: "The color value (1-9) of the pixels within the object."
      - centroid: "The average row and column coordinates of all pixels in the object."
      - direction: "The direction of movement, determined by the centroid's position relative to the grid's vertical center (1 for down, -1 for up)."
      - moved: "Boolean, indicates whether an object was able to move."
      - coordinates: "List of (row, col) tuples representing the pixel locations of the object."

actions:
  - name: "Move"
    description: "Objects move one pixel at a time in their assigned direction (up or down)."
  - name: "Collide"
    description: "Objects stop moving when they hit the grid boundary or another object."
  - name: "Stack"
    description: "Objects stack on top of each other when collisions occur."

grid:
  - properties:
    - dimensions: "The height and width of the grid."
    - vertical_center: "The midpoint of the grid's height, used to determine the direction of object movement."
