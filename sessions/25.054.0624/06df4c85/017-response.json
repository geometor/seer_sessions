            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the core concept of horizontal yellow bands and 2x2 islands of green and red within them. However, the propagation logic is flawed. It doesn't correctly handle the horizontal expansion *within* the yellow bands, and the conditional suppression of red propagation based on the presence of green above is too simplistic and incorrectly implemented. The code propagates colors across the *entire* band and does not account for cases where multiple islands of different colors are present. Example 2, in particular, has revealed that propagation should extend from the 2x2 islands, stopping if other colors are encountered. Also it has a mix of colors in the bands, and yellow should be filled in. Example 3 has revealed a bug in the red propagation, near green.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Propagation:** Instead of propagating across the entire band, we need to propagate *from each island* to the left and right, stopping when we encounter a non-yellow pixel (or the edge of the grid).\n2.  **Handle Multiple Islands:** The code needs to handle cases where multiple islands of different colors exist within the same band.\n3.  **Correct Red Suppression:** Revise the logic for suppressing red propagation. It is not simply that there *is* green above, but its exact position. It needs to prevent only overwriting the *adjacent* yellow above with red.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using the provided output, no need for code execution here):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   `match`: False\n    *   `pixels_off`: 20\n    *   `size_correct`: True\n    *   `color_palette_correct`: True\n    *   Notes: Red and green islands propagate, but don't fill the whole yellow area, and aren't expanded.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   `match`: False\n    *   `pixels_off`: 36\n    *   `size_correct`: True\n    *   `color_palette_correct`: True\n    *   Notes: Same issue as Example 1, but more pixels are off because more propagation should have occurred. The yellow in the horizontal stripes are not filled, the red and the other colored regions have not expanded\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   `match`: False\n    *   `pixels_off`: 36\n    *   `size_correct`: True\n    *   `color_palette_correct`: True\n    *   Notes: The green propagates correctly (by chance, due to full-band propagation). Red propagation is suppressed in places it shouldn't be.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - type: band\n    color: yellow (4)\n    height: 3\n    orientation: horizontal\n  - type: island\n    shape: 2x2\n    colors: [green (3), red (2)]\n    location: within_band\n\nactions:\n  - name: propagate\n    object: island\n    direction: horizontal (left and right)\n    condition: within_band\n    limit: until non-yellow pixel or grid edge\n  - name: suppress_red_propagation\n    condition:  if red island and the cell directly above any of its cells is green\n    action: do not propagate red vertically into that cell.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Yellow Bands:** Find all horizontal bands of yellow (4) pixels that are exactly three pixels high.\n\n2.  **Locate Islands:** Within each yellow band, identify 2x2 \"islands\" of green (3) or red (2) pixels.\n\n3.  **Propagate Green:** For each green (3) island:\n    *   Expand the green color horizontally to the left and right, *within the yellow band*.\n    *   Stop the expansion when a non-yellow pixel or the grid edge is encountered.\n\n4.  **Propagate Red:** For each red (2) island:\n    *   Expand the red color horizontally to the left and right, *within the yellow band*.\n    * Stop when a non-yellow pixel or the grid boundary is encountered.\n    * Check the cells directly above the current red island's cells. If any of those cells are green, then do not replace yellow color of corresponding column with red.\n\n5.  **Fill in Yellow:** Within each band, after expansion, replace any remaining yellow with the color that has most recently expanded into it. If there are multiple colors, fill with last color that would be encountered traveling left-to-right.\n\n6. **Preserve Other Pixels:** All pixels outside the identified yellow bands remain unchanged.\n"
