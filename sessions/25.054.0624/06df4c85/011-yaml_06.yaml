objects:
  - type: vertical_strip
    description: Initial colored regions, excluding white and blue, forming vertical lines.
    properties:
      color:
        - value: varies (2, 3, 4, 8, 9) # Colors observed in the examples
        - description: The color of the vertical strip.
      height:
        - value: variable
        - description:  Extends to the full height of contiguous, same-colored pixels in original.
      width:
        - value: variable
actions:
  - name: horizontal_expansion
    description: >-
      Expands the color of each vertical strip horizontally,
      replacing adjacent blue pixels. Propagation continues
      until a non-blue, non-white, pixel is encountered.
    constraints:
      - Only replaces blue pixels.
      - Expands bidirectionally.
      - Stops at white or different-colored pixels
  - name: vertical_expansion
    description: >-
      Expands the color of each vertical strip and horizontally expanded
      pixels, replacing adjacent blue pixels.
    constraints:
      - Only replaces blue pixels.
      - Expands bidirectionally.
      - Stopts at white pixels
