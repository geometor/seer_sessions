The dominant colors are yellow (4), white (0), green (3), and red (2).  There are distinct horizontal bands of solid yellow (4) pixels. Within these yellow bands are \"islands\" of other colors, primarily green (3) and red (2), that seem to be undergoing some kind of transformation.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

These bands are three pixels high.\n\n2.  **Identify Islands:** Within each yellow band, identify \"islands\" of green (3) and red (2) pixels. These islands are 2x2 blocks.\n\n3.  **Propagate Colors (Conditional):**\n    *   If an island is green (3): Expand the green color horizontally to the left and right *within* the yellow band. The expansion fills the entire width of the yellow band, replacing any white (0) pixels, only if there is an existing green island withing the yellow row.\n    *   If an island is red (2): Expand the red color horizontally to the left and right *within* the yellow band, in place of white pixels (0), only if there is an existing red island. Furthermore, if the row immediately above has green, do not replace yellow with red.\n\n4.  **No Change Outside Bands:** Pixels outside the identified yellow bands remain unchanged.\nThe rows that don't contain any Green or Red colored pixels are not affected.\n"
