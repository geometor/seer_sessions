            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results from the three training examples and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe current code implements horizontal expansion of colors based on adjacency and attempts a limited vertical expansion for colors 8 (azure) and 9 (maroon). The results show consistent mismatches, indicating flaws in both the horizontal and vertical expansion logic. The primary issue seems to be an overly restrictive horizontal rule and an incorrect, overly complex and incomplete, vertical rule. It expands the area between max and min of object columns.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n\n1.  **Simplify and Correct Horizontal Expansion:** The horizontal rule needs to be more general. Instead of requiring the *same* color on both sides, we should propagate any non-white, non-blue color horizontally into a blue pixel if the blue pixel is *between* pixels of *any* two non-white, non-blue colors.\n2.  **Revise Vertical Expansion:** The vertical expansion is clearly wrong. Vertical expansion must be applied to the *entire column* where the object is found and should consider the adjacent objects in the same column.\n3. **Consider object shapes**: Analyze if the shapes are preserved or altered during the operation.\n4.  **Iterative Improvement:** We'll focus on fixing the horizontal rule first, then tackle the vertical expansion, testing after each change.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Observation:** Horizontal expansion fails in rows with alternating colors (e.g., `8 2 2 8`). Vertical expansion of 8 is partially correct but doesn't fill the full column, missing some blue(1) pixels in the column.\n    *   **Pixels Off:** 24. Indicates significant errors.\n    *   **Shapes:** Shapes are altered; vertical strips are extended vertically.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Observation:** Similar issues to Example 1. Horizontal expansion only works for `2 2` and `4 4` but not in other instances. Vertical filling fails for both maroon(9) and azure(8).\n    *    **Pixels Off:** 36. Worse than Example 1.\n    *   **Shapes:** Shapes are altered; vertical strips are extended vertically.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Observation:** Horizontal expansion does not consider adjacent colors correctly.Vertical expansion of maroon and azure are not considered.\n    *   **Pixels Off:** 36. Consistent with the incorrect vertical expansion.\n    *   **Shapes:** Shapes are altered; vertical strips are extended vertically.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example: 1\n    objects:\n      - color: 8  # Azure\n        shape: vertical_strip\n        action: expand_vertically\n      - color: 2  # Red\n        shape: vertical_strip\n        action: expand_horizontally, expand_vertically\n      - color: 3 # Green\n        shape: vertical_strip\n        action: expand_horizontally, expand_vertically\n    horizontal_expansion:\n      rule: \"If a blue pixel is between two non-white, non-blue pixels, change the blue pixel to match the color of adjacent non-white and non-blue.\"\n      correct: false\n    vertical_expansion:\n      rule: \"If a vertical_strip with color 8 is found, fill its whole column with color 8, if it is not blocked.\"\n      correct: partially #only expands between min and max columns.\n  - example: 2\n    objects:\n      - color: 2\n        shape: vertical_strip\n        action: expand_horizontally, expand_vertically\n      - color: 4\n        shape: vertical_strip\n        action: expand_horizontally, expand_vertically\n      - color: 9\n        shape: vertical_strip\n        action: expand_vertically\n      - color: 8\n        shape: vertical_strip\n        action: expand_vertically\n    horizontal_expansion:\n      rule: \"If a blue pixel is between two non-white, non-blue pixels, change the blue pixel to match the color of adjacent non-white and non-blue.\"\n      correct: false\n    vertical_expansion:\n      rule: \"If a vertical_strip with color 9 or 8 is found, fill its whole column with respective color, if it is not blocked.\"\n      correct: false\n  - example: 3\n    objects:\n      - color: 4\n        shape: vertical_strip\n        action: expand_vertically\n      - color: 3\n        shape: vertical_strip\n        action: expand_horizontally, expand_vertically\n      - color: 2\n        shape: vertical_strip\n        action: expand_horizontally, expand_vertically\n    horizontal_expansion:\n      rule: \"If a blue pixel is between two non-white, non-blue pixels, change the blue pixel to match the color of adjacent non-white and non-blue.\"\n      correct: false\n    vertical_expansion:\n      rule: \"If a vertical_strip with certain colors is found, fill its whole column with respective color, if it is not blocked.\"\n      correct: false\ngeneral_observations:\n  - \"Shapes are consistently altered to create vertically extended strips.\"\n  - \"Horizontal filling is context-dependent and incomplete.\"\n  - \"Vertical expansion logic is consistently misapplied in all given examples.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color, excluding white (0) and blue (1). These are initial colored objects and are vertical strips.\n\n2.  **Horizontal Expansion:**\n    *   Iterate through each row of the grid.\n    *   If a blue (1) pixel is horizontally adjacent to non-white and non-blue colors, change the blue pixel's color to the color of the strip.\n\n3.  **Vertical Expansion:**\n    * Iterate through each column.\n    *   If a column contains colored objects (excluding 0 and 1), extend those colors vertically to fill the entire column, replacing blue(1) pixels. If a column has multiple colored objects, then expand all of them within the column.\n\n4. **Preservation:**\n    * The horizontal and vertical lines with color white(0) are preserved.\n"
