            "text": "Here's an analysis of the results and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the azure region and its vertical bounds. It also correctly implements the adjacency check. However, the logic for transforming blue pixels to green is too strict. It appears the transformation should occur for blue pixels adjacent to *any* azure pixel, *regardless* of whether the blue pixel is within the *entire* vertical bounds of the azure region. The current implementation is an \"AND\" of two conditions which needs to become an \"OR\". Also, Example 2 shows an edge condition where an adjacent blue pixel to the azure region is *outside* the grid, causing an error.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Relax Vertical Bound Constraint:** Modify the condition for transforming blue pixels. Instead of requiring the blue pixel's row to be *within* the azure region's vertical bounds, simply change the condition from \"if *both* conditions are true\" to \"if *either* condition is true\".\n\n2. **Edge Condition:** Correct the program to properly handle cases where the adjacent pixel is *outside* the grid, preventing a runtime error.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 3\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: True\n    *   Correct Pixel Counts: False\n    *   Observation: Three blue pixels that should have turned green did not - on row 3 (1,5), (1,6) and on row 5 (1,5).\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 2\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: True\n    *   Correct Pixel Counts: False\n    *   Observation: Two blue pixels that should have turned green did not. Also, a blue pixel outside the grid and adjacent to an azure pixel was incorrectly changed to green - on row 7 (0,0), (0,2) and row 8 (0,1).\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 6\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: True\n    *   Correct Pixel Counts: False\n    *   Observation: Several blue pixels are not transformed, similar to Example 1.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: azure_region\n    type: contiguous_block\n    color: azure (8)\n    property: vertical_bounds\n\n  - name: blue_pixel\n    type: pixel\n    color: blue (1)\n    property: adjacent_to_azure_region\n    property: within_vertical_bounds\n\nactions:\n  - name: transform_color\n    subject: blue_pixel\n    condition: adjacent_to_azure_region OR within_vertical_bounds\n    new_color: green (3)\n\n  - name: bounds_check\n    subject: blue_pixel\n    condition: adjacent_to_azure_region\n    check: within grid\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Region:** Locate all azure (8) pixels in the input grid. This forms the azure region.\n\n2.  **Determine Vertical Bounds:** Find the minimum and maximum row indices of the azure region.\n\n3.  **Conditional Transformation**: Iterate through each pixel. If a pixel is blue (1), check two things:\n    *   Is the pixel *adjacent* (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to *any* pixel in the azure region?\n    *   Does the blue pixel's row index fall *within* the vertical bounds (inclusive) of the azure region?\n\n4.  **Transformation Rule:** If *either* of the above conditions is true, change the blue pixel's color to green (3). If neither condition is true, keep the pixel's original color.\n\n5.  **Bounds Check:** When determining if a pixel is adjacent to the azure region, be sure that the adjacent pixel is inside the grid - not outside the bounds of the grid.\n"
