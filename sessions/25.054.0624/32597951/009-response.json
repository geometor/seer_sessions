            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the contiguous region of '8' (azure) pixels. However, the relative positions used to change '8' to '3' (green) are incorrect and inconsistent across the examples. The code assumes a fixed set of relative positions, which doesn't generalize well. Instead of hardcoding relative positions, we need a rule-based approach to determine which '8' pixels within the region should be changed to '3'. The second and third examples clearly shows a pattern to how 8's are converted into 3.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Pattern:** Carefully examine the input and expected output grids in all three examples to discern the pattern of '8' to '3' transformations. It looks like there's some kind of cross, X or diagonal pattern.\n2.  **Refine Relative Position Logic:** Instead of a fixed list, derive a rule or algorithm that determines the relative positions dynamically. This rule should be based on the dimensions of the bounding box of '8' or its row/column indices.\n3.  **Test and Iterate:** After updating the logic, re-run the code on all training examples and check for improvements.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using provided results, visual inspection):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Observed a 5x5 block of 8.\n    *   Pixels off: 13\n    *   There appear to be 6 azure pixels which should be green.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Observed a 4x6 block of 8.\n    *   Pixels off: 12\n    *   There appear to be 8 azure pixels which should be green\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Observed a 4x3 group of 8, repeated 4 times.\n    *   Pixels off: 17\n    *   It seems that some \"8\" are converted to 3 based on relative positions in the azure object.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: contiguous_region\n    color: 8  # azure\n    action: identify_bounds\n    description: A rectangular region of azure pixels is identified.\n  - object: pixels_within_region\n    color: 8  # azure\n    action: transform_color\n    new_color: 3  # green\n    description: >-\n      Some azure pixels within the identified region are changed to green based\n      on their position relative to the bounding box.
