Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, primarily composed of '0' (white) and '1' (blue). There's a distinct region of '8' (azure) pixels in the input, which is modified to include '3' (green) pixels in the output. The overall structure of the grid and the positions of '0' and '1' remain constant. The key change seems to be localized to the area originally occupied by the '8's.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [17, 17]
      cell_values: [0, 1, 8, 3]
  - type: region
    properties:
      initial_value: 8
      modified_value: 3
      shape: irregular  #It is not a regular shape.
      location: central_left # It is a region in the left-central zone of the input
    relations:
      - within: grid

actions:
  - type: modify_value
    agent: unknown
    target: region
    properties:
        original: 8
        new: 3
        location: specific cells
  -type: maintain_value
   agent: unknown
   target: grid
   properties:
        values: [0,1]

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the grid:** The input is a 17x17 grid of pixels.
2.  **Locate the '8' region:** Find the contiguous region of pixels with the value '8' (azure).
3.  **Modify Specific '8' Pixels to green '3':**
    *   Within the identified '8' region: the '8' values are changed to '3'.
    *   It is considered the change is on position (x,y): (1,2),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,1), (3,2) and (3,3), where (0,0) corresponds to the first '8' on the top.

4.  **Preserve other pixels:** All pixels with values '0' (white) and '1' (blue) remain unchanged.
5.  **Output grid:** The modified grid becomes the output.

In summary: A region of 8 is replaced using the original 8 region. The 8 are changed to 3. The rest is conserved.
