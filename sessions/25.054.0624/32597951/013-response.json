The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), azure (8), and green (3).  The input and output grids appear to be the same size. The core transformation seems to involve a specific interaction between the azure (8) and blue (1) pixels, resulting in the appearance of green (3) pixels in the output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

For each cluster, blue pixels can be one of two types.\n    *   Inner Blue Pixels. Those blue(1) pixels that are adjacent to azure(8) pixels *and* also adjacent to blue(1) pixels that are *not* adjecent to azure(8) pixels\n    *   Outer Blue Pixels: those blue(1) pixels that are adjacent to azure(8) pixels *and* are *not* inner blue pixels.\n\n3.  **Conditional Replacement, Outer Blue Pixels:** For all \"Outer Blue Pixels\", change any that are adjacent to azure(8) pixels to green(3).\n\n4.  **Conditional Replacement, Inner Blue Pixels:** For all \"Inner Blue Pixels\", change any that are adjacent to azure(8) pixels to green(3).\n\nIn simpler terms, the azure clusters are having their adjacent blue pixels checked.
