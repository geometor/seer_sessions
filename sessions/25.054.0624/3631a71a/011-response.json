However, the results across multiple examples reveal several key issues:\n\n1.  **Inconsistent Simplification:** The \"replace color appearing only once within an object with its most prevalent neighbor\" rule isn't consistently applied, and sometimes, it's incorrect. Many pixels remain unchanged.\n2.  **Edge Cases:** The current implementation may have problems at the edges and corner, specifically with example 3.\n3. **Missing Global Context:** The algorithm seems to operate on a very local, pixel-by-pixel basis, without a complete view of the transformations.\n\n**Strategy for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Object Analysis:** Refine the `get_objects` function, making it more robust with different object shapes and sizes.\n2.  **Rule Clarification:** Instead of a \"replace color appearing only once\" rule, we should determine the most frequent color to assign the entire object with that.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated algorithm and natural language program on each example, making incremental adjustments after each test.\n\n**Metrics and Code Execution**\n\nTo understand the errors better, let's use `get_objects` to investigate object properties in input and output.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import
