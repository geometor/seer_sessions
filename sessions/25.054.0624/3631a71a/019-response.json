The colors range from 0-9. Visually, the grids appear to contain many irregular shapes and scattered single pixels. It seems like a complex transformation. There's significant overlap in content between the input and output. It's highly probable some form of object detection/filtering/replacement is occurring.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
