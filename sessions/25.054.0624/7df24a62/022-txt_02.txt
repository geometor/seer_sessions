--- Example 2 ---
Input Grid:
[[2 2]
 [2 2]]
Expected Output:
[[2 2 2]
 [2 2 2]]
Transformed Output:
[[2 2]
 [2 2]]
Match: False
Pixels Off: 2
Expected Color Counts: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 6, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0, 9: 0}
Transformed Color Counts: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 4, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0, 9: 0}
Pixel differences (expected -> transformed):
  (0,2): 2 -> False
  (1,2): 2 -> False
