--- Example 3 ---
Input Grid:
[[3 3]
 [3 3]]
Expected Output:
[[3 3 3 3]
 [3 3 3 3]]
Transformed Output:
[[3 3]
 [3 3]]
Match: False
Pixels Off: 4
Expected Color Counts: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 8, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0, 9: 0}
Transformed Color Counts: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 4, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0, 9: 0}
Pixel differences (expected -> transformed):
  (0,2): 3 -> False
  (0,3): 3 -> False
  (1,2): 3 -> False
  (1,3): 3 -> False
