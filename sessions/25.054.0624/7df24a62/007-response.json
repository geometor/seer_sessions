The colors present are yellow (4), blue (1), and white (0).  There are distinct yellow objects scattered across the grid. A blue square appears in the input and a mirrored version appears at the bottom. It appears the output maintains the yellow objects.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Place the mirrored 4x4 blue square in the bottom-center region.\n\nIn summary, the transformation preserves the yellow pixels and adds a mirrored blue square on the opposite vertical side of the grid.\n"
