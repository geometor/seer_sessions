The primary colors involved seem to be blue (1), yellow/orange (4), and white/background (0). There are distinct regions of blue and isolated yellow pixels. The transformation seems to involve some kind of interaction or merging between the blue and yellow regions. The output retains some yellow pixels from the input, and alters the blue regions, in some cases inserting blue pixels where yellow pixels existed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Now consider where the yellow pixels existed *within* the region of the blue square in the input.\n    \n3.  **Yellow Pixel Replacement/Retention:** If the yellow pixel was *outside* of the perimeter of the original blue square, retain and keep in original position. If within/on the boundary of the original blue square, replace with blue.\n\n4. **Output Generation:** Create the output grid by replicating any background pixels. Fill yellow pixels according to the retention rule in step 3. Fill other pixels with the modified regions of blue.\n\nIn summary, the transformation involves expanding a blue square region and selectively replacing yellow pixels with blue pixels, depending on where they existed in relation to the original blue region in the input, and keeping those yellow pixels that are outside this original region.\n"
