facts:
  - object: green_pixel
    color: green (3)
    description: The starting point for the transformation.
    action: Initiates adjacency check.

  - object: white_pixel
    color: white (0)
    description:  Potentially transformed if adjacent to a green pixel.
    action: Changes color to yellow if directly adjacent to green.

  - object: adjacent_pixel
    color: varies
    description: A pixel directly above, below, to the left, or to the right of another pixel. *Crucially, NOT diagonally adjacent.*
    action: Determines which white pixels are transformed.

  - object: other_pixel
    color: varies
    description: any pixel that is not green or is not adjacent to green.
    action: No action taken

  - transformation: color_change
    input: white_pixel
    output: yellow_pixel
    condition:  white_pixel is directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a green_pixel.

  - grid_property: dimensions
    description: The height and width of the grid remain constant.
    action: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
