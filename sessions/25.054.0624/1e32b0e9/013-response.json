The most prominent feature is a horizontal line of blue (1) pixels. Green (3) pixels appear sporadically. The transformation seems to involve a repeating pattern related to the blue and green pixels. It looks to me that all 1's that aren't on the two horizontal lines of 1's are shifting.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
