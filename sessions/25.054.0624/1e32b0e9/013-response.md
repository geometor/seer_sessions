Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid with three colors: white (0), blue (1), and green (3). The most prominent feature is a horizontal line of blue (1) pixels. Green (3) pixels appear sporadically. The transformation seems to involve a repeating pattern related to the blue and green pixels. It looks to me that all 1's that aren't on the two horizontal lines of 1's are shifting.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    values: [0, 1, 3]  # white, blue, green
    properties:
      color:
        white: 0
        blue: 1
        green: 3
      position: [row, col]

  - type: grid
    properties:
      height: 17
      width: 17

  - type: line
    properties:
      color: blue
      orientation: horizontal

  - type: shape
    properties:
        color: green

actions:
    - name: insert
      description: insert blue between existing green, or adjacent to a single green

relationships:
  - blue_line_constant: The horizontal blue lines remain unchanged.
  - green_blue_interaction:  Blue pixels are inserted in a pattern related to the green pixels and other blues.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Constant Elements:** The two horizontal lines of blue (1) pixels, one near the middle and another near the bottom of the grid, remain unchanged throughout the transformation.

2. **Green Preservation**: The green pixels remain in the same position.

3.  **Blue Pixel Insertion - Columns with Green:** For every other column *not* containing a green pixel:
    *   If there is currently *not* a blue pixel, do not add a blue pixel

4.  **Blue Pixel Insertion - Columns without Green:** For every other column containing a green pixel:
    *   If there is currently *not* a blue pixel, and a blue does not exist anywhere else in this column, add a blue pixel.

In summary, the program preserves the horizontal blue lines and the location of the green pixels, inserting additional blue pixels into columns with greens and alternating inserting a 1 in all other columns, not including those two rows of 1s.
