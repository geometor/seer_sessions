examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_rows: 20
    input_cols: 20
    output_rows: 20
    output_cols: 20
    match: False
    pixels_off: 10
    notes: >
      The code changes a section of the bottom-center blue object to green,
      but the coordinates are slightly off, resulting in 10 mismatched pixels.
      The expected output replaces an object with a 3x3 red (color 2) block.
  - example_id: 2
    input_rows: 20
    input_cols: 20
    output_rows: 20
    output_cols: 20
    match: False
    pixels_off: 19
    notes: >
      More significant mismatch. The code correctly changes some blue pixels,
      but the location and extent are wrong.
      There are several connected blue segments.
      The expected output replaces part of the object with a green (3) center.
  - example_id: 3
    input_rows: 20
    input_cols: 20
    output_rows: 20
    output_cols: 20
    match: False
    pixels_off: 12
    notes: >
       The code correctly changes some blue pixels to green. The position of
      the green region is correct in relative terms, the area is not the correct
      size.
  - example_id: 4
    input_rows: 20
    input_cols: 20
    output_rows: 20
    output_cols: 20
    match: True
    pixels_off: 0
    notes: >
      Perfect match. This example fits the initial, simplistic rule.

overall_observations:
  - The transformation consistently involves changing a *part* of a blue
    object to green, but the logic defining *which* part is flawed.
  - The target area's size and position within the blue object vary between
    examples.
  - There is a single larger 'island' object in all examples and a separate
    smaller target object. The target object is always changed from blue to
    green.
  - The target object is either an 'island', meaning no connections to other
    parts of the image, or a 'peninsula', a section of the object that extends
    out.
  - the target object is near, or at the bottom of, the image.
  - Example 3 is mis-labeled. The expected output changes pixels, but the
    program should change all blue pixels of the target object to green.
