"""
1.  **Find Objects:** Identify all distinct, contiguous objects (shapes) in the grid.  An object is a group of connected pixels of the same color. Consider pixels connected, even diagonally.

2.  **Identify Key Colors:** Focus on objects with colors blue (1), green (3), and gray (5).

3.  **Gray Container:** For each gray (5) object, consider it a "container".

4.  **Green Reference Shapes:** Within each gray container, identify all green (3) objects.  These are the "reference shapes".

5.  **Blue Target Shapes:** Identify all blue (1) objects. These are the "target shapes."

6.  **Shape Matching and Transformation:** For each blue (1) object:
    *   Compare its shape to *each* of the green (3) reference shapes *anywhere within any* gray container. The shapes must be identical in configuration but may be translated (located in different positions). The comparison should not rely on absolute position or a fixed offset between top-left corners.
    *   If a shape match is found between the blue object and *any* green object *within any* gray container, change the color of all pixels in the matching blue object to green (3).

7.  **Preserve Other Objects:** All other objects that do not meet the above criteria remain unchanged. The background (color 0) also remains unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code correctly identifies objects and their shapes, but the logic for matching and transforming blue objects based on green reference shapes within gray containers has flaws. The primary issues are:

1.  **Incorrect Matching Scope:** The original program was too restrictive. It seems it only correctly matched when the green object was within the *same* gray container as the blue object. The instructions, and subsequent examples show the match should occur if *any* green object with a matching shape in *any* gray container is found.
2.  **Incorrect Shape Match Location**: The matching of the green objects to the blue objects was not considering just the shape, but the location of that shape. In the first example, the blue shapes were correctly not transformed because there were no gray objects containing a 3x1 green object.
3.  **Incorrect Assumption**: The description assumed that there would always be a green shape within a gray area. This is false.

The strategy to resolve these errors will be:

1.  **Broaden Matching Scope:** Modify the natural language program (and subsequently the code) to check for shape matches against *all* green objects in *all* gray containers, not just the same container.
2.  **Shape Configuration**: Ensure the program accurately describes how we will match by just shape configuration, removing any location dependent assumptions.
3.  **Update Assumption**: Modify the natural language program, removing the assumption about where the green reference objects will be located.

**Metrics and Observations (per example):**

Here, I summarize key properties and how the original logic failed.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Gray containers: Yes (top left).
    *   Green objects within containers: No.
    *   Blue objects: Yes.
    *   Matching shapes (blue to any green in any container): Yes, but no green objects within any container.
    *   **Error:** It did not transform the blue objects to green correctly because there were no green shapes *within* the gray object.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Gray containers: Yes.
    *   Green objects within containers: Yes.
    *   Blue objects: Yes.
    *   Matching shapes (blue to any green in any container): Yes.
    *   **Result:** Correctly transforms some blue objects to green based on matching shapes in a gray container.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Gray containers: Yes.
    *   Green objects within containers: No
    *   Blue objects: Yes.
    *   Matching shapes (blue to any green in any container): Yes, a 3x1 blue object matches 2x red object that is inside a gray area. There are no green objects within a gray object.
    *   **Error:** Did not perform transformation as there was no 3 x 1 green object inside the gray container.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Gray containers: Yes.
    *   Green objects: Yes, some *within* containers.
    *   Blue objects: Yes.
    *   Matching Shapes (blue to any green): Yes
    *   **Error**: Did not perform all correct transformations because it may not check all possible combinations of green objects and containers.

**YAML Fact Block:**

        shape: 'varied'
        matched: false # no matching green
        transform: false

example_4:
  gray_containers:
    - exists: true
  green_objects:
    - exists: true
      within_gray: true
      shape: "varied"
  blue_objects:
      - exists: true
        shape: "varied"
        matched_to_green: true/false # Needs precise matching
        transform: some
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all distinct objects in the grid. An object is a group of connected pixels of the same color (diagonal connections are allowed).

2.  **Key Colors:** Focus on objects colored gray (5), green (3), and blue (1).

3.  **Gray Containers:** Consider gray (5) objects as potential "containers."

4.  **Shape Matching:** For each blue (1) object:
    *   Compare its shape to the shape of *every* green (3) object *anywhere* in the grid.
    *   Two objects have the same shape if their pixel configurations are identical, regardless of their position within the grid. Only the relative positions of pixels within each object matter.

5.  **Transformation:** If a blue (1) object's shape matches a green (3) object's shape, change all pixels of the blue object to green (3).

6. **Preservation**: All objects, not blue, or all blue shapes that do *not* have a matching shape, are not changed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
