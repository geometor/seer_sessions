The primary colors observed are white (0), grey (5), red (2), and blue (1). The transformation seems to involve a color substitution, specifically, blue (1) becomes red (2), while all other colors appear to remain constant. The shapes and relative positions of the objects also appear to remain constant.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"
