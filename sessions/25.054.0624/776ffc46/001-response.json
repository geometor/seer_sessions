The primary colors involved are gray (5), blue (1), red (2), and white (0). There appear to be two main shapes formed: a \"cross\" shape made of red pixels and an \"L\" or partial rectangle shape of blue pixels. The transformation seems to involve a color swap based on the shapes present.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
