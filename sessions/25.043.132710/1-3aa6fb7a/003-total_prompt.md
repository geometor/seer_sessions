--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, let's analyze the transformation from `example_1_input` to `example_1_output`.

Here's a step-by-step natural language description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects and Properties:** The primary objects are squares of the color 8 (likely representing a specific color, e.g., dark gray).

2.  **Transformation Rule:**
    The rule is: For the smallest shape of color 8, number 1 is placed in the top left pixel in a line going vertically and number 1 is placed in the bottom right most pixel of the same shape in the line going vertically.

3.  **Step-by-step application of rule:**
    - The input has two shapes of color 8:
        -Shape 1: A vertical line of two pixels on the left side.
        -Shape 2: A vertical line of two pixel on the right side.
    - Apply the rule: The number 1 is placed in the top left pixel in shape 1 and it is also placed in the bottom right pixel of shape 2.

**Natural Language Program (NLP):**

Locate all shapes of color 8. For each shape of color 8, check if there are many or only one shape. Place the number 1 in the top left pixel that composes vertically that color 8 shape and the bottom right most pixel in the shapes of color 8 that are vertically shaped.
