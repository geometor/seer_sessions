## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x78586A0704C0>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x78586A0719F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The transformation seems to involve a rotation of the grid's contents. The colors themselves remain unchanged, but their positions within the grid are altered. The transformation appears to be a rotation.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
    element_type: color
  - observation: input grid colors match output grid colors
  - transformation_type: rotation
  - rotation_direction: clockwise or counter-clockwise (needs further investigation)
  - rotation_angle: 90, 180 or 270 (needs clarification)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a 3x3 grid of integers representing colors.
2.  **Rotate:** Rotate the entire grid by 180 degrees clockwise. We can verify visually. Original top left now bottom right. Original bottom right is now top left.
3. **Output:** the 180 degree rotated grid.

Based on just a single example pair, my initial best guess on the general rule is 180 degree clockwise rotation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
