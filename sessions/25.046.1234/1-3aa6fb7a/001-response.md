Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[1,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions:  [[4,4]]
  background:
     color: 0 (white)

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure). The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white), which serves as the background.

2.  **Detect Change:** By comparing the output and input grids, it appears that a single cell of value '1' (blue) is added to the right of the top-left corner of each L-shape.

3. **Transformation Rule:**

    *   Locate each azure (8) L-shaped object.
    *   For each one, identify their top-left corner.
    *   Change the color of the cell directly to the right of the identified corner to blue (1).
    *   Leave the original azure objects unchanged, as well as the white background.

In summary, the input contains azure L-shapes on white. In the output, a single blue cell has been added to the right of each L-shape's top-left corner. Everything else remains the same.
