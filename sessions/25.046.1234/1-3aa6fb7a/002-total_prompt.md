Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[1,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions:  [[4,4]]
  background:
     color: 0 (white)

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure). The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white), which serves as the background.

2.  **Detect Change:** By comparing the output and input grids, it appears that a single cell of value '1' (blue) is added to the right of the top-left corner of each L-shape.

3. **Transformation Rule:**

    *   Locate each azure (8) L-shaped object.
    *   For each one, identify their top-left corner.
    *   Change the color of the cell directly to the right of the identified corner to blue (1).
    *   Leave the original azure objects unchanged, as well as the white background.

In summary, the input contains azure L-shapes on white. In the output, a single blue cell has been added to the right of each L-shape's top-left corner. Everything else remains the same.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    expected_output = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    print()
    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
