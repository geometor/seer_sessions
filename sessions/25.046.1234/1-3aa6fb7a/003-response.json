This requires considering different rotations of the L-shape.\n    *   Add a blue (1) cell to the right of the identified top-left corner.\n    *   Preserve the existing azure L-shapes and the white background.\n\nThe core concept is consistent with the first example: identify the top-left corner of each azure L-shape and place a blue cell to its right. The generalization now clearly includes handling different rotations of the L-shapes. The previous Python implementation should be correct.\n"
