Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
      positions: [[5,4], [6,4], [6,3]]

  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[1,4]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[2,3]]
     - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
      positions: [[5,4], [6,4], [6,3]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
       shape: single cell
       positions: [[5,3]]
  background:
     color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure) in various rotations, and a background of color 0 (white).

2.  **Detect Change:** Comparing the output and input grids, it's evident that a single cell of color 1 (blue) has been added to the right of the top-left cell of *each* azure L-shape.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   Locate all azure (8) L-shaped objects.
    *   For each L-shape, find the top-left corner cell. This requires considering different rotations of the L-shape.
    *   Add a blue (1) cell to the right of the identified top-left corner.
    *   Preserve the existing azure L-shapes and the white background.

The core concept is consistent with the first example: identify the top-left corner of each azure L-shape and place a blue cell to its right. The generalization now clearly includes handling different rotations of the L-shapes. The previous Python implementation should be correct.
