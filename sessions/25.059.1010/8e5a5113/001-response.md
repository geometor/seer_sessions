Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation occurring between the input and output grids.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x11 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 3x11 grid. The most prominent visual feature is the presence of a vertical "divider" of grey (5) pixels in the input grids, always in the 5th column.  The output grids also retain the grey divider. The areas to the left and the right seem to be involved in a sort of exchange and mirroring operation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x11
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x11
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - name: divider_column
    type: 1D array
    dimensions: 3x1
    elements: integer (5)
    location: column 5
  - name: left_block
    type: 2d array
    dimensions: 3x4
  - name: right_block
    type: 2d array
    dimensions: 3x6
  - name: output_left_block
    type: 2D array
    dimension: 3x4
  - name: output_mid_block
     type: 2D array
     dimension: 3x3
  - name: output_right_block
      type: 2D array
      dimension: 3x3

actions:
  - name: mirror_reflect_horizontal
    description: Reflects a block of pixels horizontally.
  - name: copy
    description: Copies the block to another part.
  - name: exchange
    description: Swaps pixel values between corresponding sub-blocks

relationships:
  - divider_separates_blocks: The divider column separates the input grid into a left block (columns 1-4) and a right block (columns 6-11).
  - mirroring: There's horizontal mirroring happening related to the divider.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Key Regions:** Divide the input grid into three regions: a left block (columns 1-4), a divider column (column 5), and a right block (columns 6-11).

2. **Divider Preservation:** The divider column (all 5s) remains unchanged in the output grid.

3. **Left Block Transformation:**
    - create an empty output_left_block
    - Reverse the *order* of the columns of the input Left block and put into a temp block.
    - For the input left block columns, from left to right, examine pairs of pixels (adjacent colors).
    - Within each horizontal pair, exchange the positions of any two pixels that are *different colors*. If they are the same color, they are not swapped.
    - save the temp block as output_left_block.

4.  **Right Block Transformation:**
    - take columns 6-8 from the right block, reverse the *order* of the columns, and save them to the output_mid_block.
    - Take columns 9-11 of the right block, reverse the *order* of the columns, and exchange each horizontal pair of *different colors* within each row, just like step 3, and save them to the output_right_block.

5. **Combine:** Construct the output grid by combining output_left_block, the original divider column, output_mid_block and output_right_block.
