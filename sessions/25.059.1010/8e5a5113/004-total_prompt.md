Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x11). The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement and potential duplication of certain colored pixels, while others are completely replaced. The right half of the input grid filled with gray (5) and white (0) seems to provide the template for the replacement, with colors from the left side filling in a specific pattern. It appears there is an element of mirroring and shifting occurring, potentially based on the vertical dividing line between the colorful and non-colorful parts.

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
task_name: ARC_e560c10d
input_grid:
  dimensions: [3, 11]
  objects:
    - id: 1
      color: blue
      positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [1,1]]
    - id: 2
      color: red
      positions: [[0,2]]
    - id: 3
      color: yellow
    - id: 4
        color: gray
        positions: all pixels where x >= 4 in input
    - id: 5
        color: white
        positions: input grid empty spaces

output_grid:
  dimensions: [3, 11]
  objects:
    - id: 6
      color: blue, red, yellow, and gray.
      positions:
        blue: All positions that were either blue or gray.
        red: all postions that were either red or white.
        yellow: all positions were gray are now yellow or blue
        gray: all positions that were gray in input remain gray.

transformation:
  type: rearrangement, mirroring, shift
  rules:
    - The input grid is divided vertically into two halves.
    - The colors on the left half of input replace some of the colors from right half of the input.
    - Colors are potentially mirrored or shifted.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Mentally divide the input grid into two vertical halves. The left half contains colored pixels (blue, red, yellow), and the right half consists of grey and white pixels.

2.  **Mirror/Shift & Replace:** The right half of the *output* grid appears to take its structure of gray (5) pixels from the *input*, but with colors from left half replacing them based on the following:

    *   Locate all of the gray pixels. For any gray pixel in the input grid, the pixel will either be yellow, blue, or stay grey.
    *   Locate the white pixels. The white pixels will all be replaced with either the red or blue value.
    *   The left side colors are transposed onto the right side based on their original positions.

3. The overall shape of the gray color in the right side of the input remain the same and fixed.

Essentially, the right half of the input grid acts as a template. The program replaces grays and whites with colors found on the left half. The position of the colors relative to each other seems transposed onto the grey area.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
