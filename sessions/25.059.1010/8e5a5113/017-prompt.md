Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is divided into two sections: a left section (first four columns) and a right section (remaining columns).
The output grid is constructed as follows:
1. The left section of the input grid is copied to the output grid.
2. A mirrored version of the left section is inserted to columns 5-7.
3. An inverted version of the left section is placed in the final four columns.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the observed rules."""

    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # 1. Copy the left section (first four columns) to the output
    left_section = input_grid[:, :4]
    output_grid[:, :4] = left_section

    # 2. Mirror the left Section and add
    mirrored_section = np.flip(left_section, axis=(0, 1))
    output_grid[:, 4:7] = mirrored_section[:, 1:]

    # 3. Invert Left section and insert in final three columns.
    inverted_section = np.flip(left_section, axis=1)
    output_grid[:, 7:11] = inverted_section

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
