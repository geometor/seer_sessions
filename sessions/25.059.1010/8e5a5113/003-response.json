The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x11). The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement and potential duplication of certain colored pixels, while others are completely replaced. The right half of the input grid filled with gray (5) and white (0) seems to provide the template for the replacement, with colors from the left side filling in a specific pattern. It appears there is an element of mirroring and shifting occurring, potentially based on the vertical dividing line between the colorful and non-colorful parts.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

The left half contains colored pixels (blue, red, yellow), and the right half consists of grey and white pixels.\n\n2.  **Mirror/Shift & Replace:** The right half of the *output* grid appears to take its structure of gray (5) pixels from the *input*, but with colors from left half replacing them based on the following:\n\n    *   Locate all of the gray pixels. For any gray pixel in the input grid, the pixel will either be yellow, blue, or stay grey.\n    *   Locate the white pixels. The white pixels will all be replaced with either the red or blue value.\n    *   The left side colors are transposed onto the right side based on their original positions.\n\n3. The overall shape of the gray color in the right side of the input remain the same and fixed.\n\nEssentially, the right half of the input grid acts as a template. The program replaces grays and whites with colors found on the left half. The position of the colors relative to each other seems transposed onto the grey area.\n"
