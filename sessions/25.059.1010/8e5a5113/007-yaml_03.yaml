  - name: mirror_and_replace
    description: The structure of the right half of the input grid is preserved in the output grid, but the colors are replaced based on the colors in the left half.
    steps:
      - Find gray pixels (5) on right half of output.
      - find the color in the same row, mirrored position to the left side.
      - if the left side pixel is not gray, replace.
      - Find white pixels (0) on right side.
      - find the color in the same row, on the left side (starting from the leftmost position).
      - find the first non-gray color and use it for the replacement.
