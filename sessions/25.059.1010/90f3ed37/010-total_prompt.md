Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, initially mostly white (0) with some azure (8) elements. The transformation seems to involve changing some of the azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels. The azure pixels appear in horizontal lines of varying lengths. The core of the transformation appears to lie in replacing a segment of azure pixels with blue, starting from where an azure region ends.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - azure (8)
        - blue (1)
      position:
        row: [0-14]
        column: [0-9]
  - type: azure_region
    properties:
      shape: horizontal_line
      start_position:
        row: int
        column: int
      end_position:
         row: int
         column: int
      length: int

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    parameters:
      original_color: 8
      new_color: 1
      start_row: int
      start_column: int
      end_row: int
      end_column: int

relationships:
 - azure_regions are composed of adjacent azure pixels
 - replacement occurs within the bounds of azure regions
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Find all contiguous horizontal lines of azure (8) pixels.
2.  **Determine Replacement Area:** For each identified azure region, find the end, and use this to begin the replacement.
3.  **Replace Azure with Blue:** Within each azure region, starting after the end of the original azure region, replace azure pixels with blue pixels, extending the same length as the original azure.

In simple terms, the transformation finds lines of azure color, and adds a new line segment after it, of equal length, but color blue.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
