<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2048x2000 at 0x7F2DF794F9D0>Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to discern the underlying transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing pixels of two colors: azure (8) and white (0), with the transformation introducing blue (1) pixels. The azure pixels seem to be the primary objects of interest, and their spatial arrangement appears crucial. The introduced blue pixels seem to relate to the positions of the azure pixels somehow.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_pixels
    color: azure (8)
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - position: (row, col)
  - name: blue_pixels
    color: blue (1)
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - position: (row, col)
  - name: background
    color: white (0)
    type: pixel
    properties: {}

actions:
  - name: create_blue_pixels
    description: New blue pixels are created based on the azure pixel positions.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The relationship between adjacent azure and white cells.
  - type: positional_mapping
    description:  Azure pixels map in some way to a new set of blue pixels.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value 8 (azure) in the input grid.

2.  **Conditional Blue Pixel Creation**: For each azure pixel in input:
    - examine a right side horizontal "line" (series of adjacent pixels) starting at this position.

3.  **Transformation**: Create new blue pixels in same row and where all examined positions in input were 0, place a 1 in the output.

In summary, the transformation identifies azure pixels and creates blue pixels to the right in rows and columns, based on white '0' pixels adjacent to the azure pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
