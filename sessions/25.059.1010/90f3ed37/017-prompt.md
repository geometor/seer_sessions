Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation preserves the existing azure (8) pixels and selectively introduces blue (1) pixels in the locations that follow the perceived checkerboard pattern established in the top section of the grid. The output shows the bottom part of the pattern being completed with color '1'.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by filling in missing azure (8) pixels in the checkerboard
    pattern with blue (1) pixels, starting from row 6.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Iterate through the grid starting from row 6
    for r in range(5, rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            # Check for the expected checkerboard pattern
            # Azure should be present based on position on grid.
            # start a pattern, then skip a line. start a pattern, then skip a line.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
