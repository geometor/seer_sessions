If the location contains 0, change to 1, If it contains 8, keep 8.\n\n4. **Maintain Grid dimensions** output grid is same size as input\n\nIn essence, the transformation preserves the existing azure (8) pixels and selectively introduces blue (1) pixels in the locations that follow the perceived checkerboard pattern established in the top section of the grid. The output shows the bottom part of the pattern being completed with color '1'.\n"
