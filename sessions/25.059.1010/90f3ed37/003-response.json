The transformation seems to involve adding new blue (1) pixels based on the positions of the azure pixels, but not directly replacing them. The azure pixels remain in the output. There's a spatial relationship between the azure and blue pixels. Specifically, the blue pixels seem to appear below and separated from the azure pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
