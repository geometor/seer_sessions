The most obvious difference between the input and output grids is that the output grids mostly consist of zeros (white), with only a small, solid-colored rectangular block remaining in some cases. The position and color of this remaining block vary.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Find the largest rectangular block of pixels that are all of the same color and are contiguously connected (horizontally or vertically, but *not* diagonally). If there are multiple blocks of the same largest size, other information not contained in these inputs are used.\n2.  **Clear Other Pixels:** Create the output grid, initially filled entirely with 0 (white).\n3.  **Preserve the Identified Block:** Copy the pixels of the largest identified solid-colored block from the input grid to the *exact same position* in the output grid. All other pixels in the output grid remain 0.\n\nIn summary, the transformation rule is to find the largest, solid-colored, rectangular, contiguous block within the input grid and preserve it in the output grid, setting all other pixels to white (0).\n"
