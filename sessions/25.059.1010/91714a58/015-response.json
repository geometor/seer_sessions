Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input is a grid with various single-digit numbers (0-9), representing different colors.\n*   The output is a grid of the same dimensions, but it appears to be mostly empty (filled with 0s) except for a concentrated area of 7s.\n*   The 7s in the output seem to correspond to a cluster of 7s in the input, although other instances of '7' are in the input and do not appear in the output. It appears the largest cluster of '7' is preserved.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Contiguous means pixels are adjacent horizontally or vertically. Diagonal adjacency doesn't seem to contribute.\n4.  **Clear Output:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized with all cells set to 0 (white).\n5.  **Reconstruct:** Copy the largest cluster of 7s found in step 3 to the output grid, maintaining its original shape and relative position.\n6. **Ignore other 7s**: All other 7s which are not part of the largest cluster are ignored (replaced with 0).\n7. **Final Output:** All other colored pixels in the input grid are set to 0 in the output grid, the identified cluster will be the only non zero area.\n\nEssentially, the transformation finds the largest connected \"island\" of 7s in the input and reproduces *only* that island in the output, setting everything else to 0.\n"
