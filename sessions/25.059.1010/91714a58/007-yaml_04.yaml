examples:
  - id: example_1
    multicolored_object_present: true
    overlapping_red_rectangle_present: true
    correct: true
    notes: "The initial logic works correctly here."
  - id: example_2
    multicolored_object_present: false
    overlapping_red_rectangle_present: false
    correct: false
    notes: "Fails because it selects the largest red rectangle, output is incorrect. A different red rectangle is in the output"
  - id: example_3
    multicolored_object_present: false
    overlapping_red_rectangle_present: false
    correct: false
    notes: "Fails; selects largest red rectangle (the entire grid). There seems to be a smaller, specific red rectangle that needs to be identified."
  - id: example_4
    multicolored_object_present: true
    overlapping_red_rectangle_present: false
    correct: false
    notes: "Fails. Selects largest rectangle (entire grid) even though a multi-colored object exists. The logic does not handle no overlapping."
  - id: example_5
    multicolored_object_present: true
    overlapping_red_rectangle_present: true
    correct: false
    notes: "Fails, even with a multi colored object and overlap. Selects the wrong rectangle."
red_rectangles:
    - "multiple red rectangles are present in most of the examples"
    - "red rectangles can be any size and do not need to be a specific orientation"
multicolored_objects:
  - "not always present"
  - "when present, seems important to define the correct red rectangle"
general:
  - "The current logic based on 'largest red rectangle' and 'overlapping with multicolored object' is incorrect for most examples."
  - "The critical element seems to be selecting the *correct* red rectangle, not necessarily the largest or overlapping one."
  - "The correct red rectangle might have some spatial relationship with the multicolored area or other figures when they are there."
