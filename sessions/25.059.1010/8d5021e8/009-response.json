The input is a 3x2 grid, and the output is a 9x4 grid. The colors involved appear to be red (2) and white (0). The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input grid, with a specific pattern of repetition and arrangement of the colors. The most noticeable change is the change is size and positioning of the colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The 2x2 block is horizontally repeated across starting at output positions, (0,1), and (0,2). These three blocks of 2x2 red squares make up the first two row.\n\n4. **Vertical Placement:** The set of three horizontal 2x2 blocks is placed into the output 3 times.\n\n5.  **Fill Remaining:** All other cells not filled by red (value 2) are filled with white (value 0).\n\nIn short, the core operation is the expansion of the input grid, and placement of 2x2 blocks of the color red, with the remaining area filled with white.\n"
