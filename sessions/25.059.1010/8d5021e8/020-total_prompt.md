Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Reflect Horizontally:** The input grid is reflected horizontally. Imagine a vertical mirror placed to the right of the input grid; the reflection appears next to the original.
2.  **Reflect Vertically:** The combined grid (original and horizontal reflection) is then reflected vertically. Imagine a horizontal mirror placed below the combined grid; the reflection appears below.
3. **Expansion**: The output grid size is double the size of the input grid in both dimensions.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # 1. Reflect Horizontally:
    # Use np.fliplr() to flip the input array along the horizontal axis (left-to-right).
    horizontal_reflection = np.fliplr(input_array)

    # Concatenate the original array and its horizontal reflection side-by-side.
    combined_horizontal = np.concatenate((input_array, horizontal_reflection), axis=1)

    # 2. Reflect Vertically:
    # Flip the combined array (original + horizontal reflection) along the vertical axis (up-to-down).
    vertical_reflection = np.flipud(combined_horizontal)

    # 3. Combine for Final Output:
    # Concatenate the combined_horizontal array and its vertical reflection.
    output_array = np.concatenate((combined_horizontal, vertical_reflection), axis=0)

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists for the final output.
    return output_array.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on the first training example, which involved horizontal and vertical reflections, effectively quadrupling the input grid. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this is not the universally applicable rule. Some examples only involve a single reflection (either horizontal or vertical), while others involve different color mappings or object manipulations.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair in the training set, paying close attention to the dimensions, colors, and spatial relationships.
2.  **Identify Discrepancies:** Compare the actual output with the output produced by the current code. Note the specific differences (e.g., incorrect dimensions, wrong colors, misplaced objects).
3.  **Categorize Transformations:** Group the examples based on the type of transformation observed (e.g., reflection, color change, object movement).
4.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Develop a revised, more general natural language program that encompasses the variety of transformations observed across all training examples. The updated program should describe conditions, contexts or parameters for each transform operation.
5. **Document Facts**: Create a yaml document describing the ground truth about input and outputs, objects, actions, and results for each example

**Metrics and Observations**

To provide accurate metrics, I'll describe key features of each example and result.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input Dimensions:** 3x3
*   **Output Dimensions:** 6x6
*   **Transformation:** Horizontal and Vertical Reflection (quadrupling)
*   **Code Result:** Correct

**Example 2:**

*   **Input Dimensions:** 5x5
*   **Output Dimensions:** 5x10
*   **Transformation:** Horizontal Reflection only
*   **Code Result:** Incorrect (output is 10x10)

**Example 3:**

*   **Input Dimensions:** 3x3
*   **Output Dimensions:** 6x3
*   **Transformation:** Vertical Reflection only
*   **Code Result:** Incorrect (output is 6x6)

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Determine Reflection Type:** Analyze the input and output dimensions.
    *   If the output width is double the input width and the output height is the same as the input height, perform a horizontal reflection.
    *   If the output height is double the input height and the output width is the same as the input width, perform a vertical reflection.
    *   If both the output width and height are double the input dimensions, perform both horizontal and vertical reflections (as in the original program).
2. **Perform Reflection:**
    * **Horizontal Reflection:** Create a mirrored copy of the input grid to the right of the original.
    * **Vertical Reflection:** Create a mirrored copy of the input grid below the original.
    * **Combined Reflection:** First, perform a horizontal reflection. Then, create a mirrored copy of the combined (original + horizontal reflection) grid below.

3.  The color mapping does not need to change. The values retain their meaning.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
