            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe core elements appear to be 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The input grids are consistently smaller than the output grids.  The transformation seems to involve expanding the input grid and rearranging the non-zero elements. The zero-valued pixels seem to act as a background or filler. The non-zero values are duplicated and mirrored to create a larger, symmetrical pattern in the output. The output grids have a very specific structure, with non-zero number appearing in the 4 corners of the larger output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
