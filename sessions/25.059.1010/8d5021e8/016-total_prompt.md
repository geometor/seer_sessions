**input:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a small 2D grid (input) into a larger 2D grid (output). The grids contain numerical values representing colors (0 for white and 5 for gray). The input grid appears to be a "seed" or "pattern" that is expanded and replicated in the output grid. The spatial relationship between the gray pixels (5) in the input seems to be a key factor influencing the output. The output maintains symmetries.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x2
    elements: [0, 5]
    description: Initial pattern or seed.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 9x4
    elements: [0, 5]
    description: Expanded and replicated pattern derived from the input.
  - action: expansion
    type: spatial transformation
    description: The input grid is expanded into a larger grid.
  - action: replication
    type: pattern repetition
    description: The pattern of the input, or a transformation of, is repeated.
  - relationship: input_output_size
    type: scaling
    description: The output grid dimensions are multiples of the input grid dimensions. 9/3 = 3 vertically and 4/2=2 horizontally
  - observation: symmetry
    type: geometric
    description: output is symmetrical around both the horizontal and vertical axes
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the input pattern:** The input is a 3x2 grid.
2.  **Determine expansion factors:** The output grid is 9x4. Calculate expansion factors: vertical (9/3 = 3) and horizontal (4/2 = 2).
3.  **Expand and reflect**: Expand the input. Each original row gets copied 3 times vertically and then reflected around its horizontal and vertical axes. Each original column is copied two times horizontally.

In simpler terms: Take the input grid, copy each row three times vertically, and copy each column twice horizontally. Reflect the input around it's horizontal and vertical axes, while expanding to get a larger image.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
