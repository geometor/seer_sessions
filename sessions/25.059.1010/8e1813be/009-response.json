The input grid contains several distinct colored regions: a gray square, a blue vertical line, a red vertical line, and a yellow vertical line. The output grid seems to extract only the blue, red, and yellow colors, maintaining their relative horizontal positions. The gray square and white background are ignored. The output grid appears to take the right-most occurrence of non-background and non-gray pixels from each column.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Ignore white (0) and grey(5).\n2.  **Locate Columns:** For each column in the input grid that contains at least one of the target colored, record the right-most value of target colored.\n3.  **Construct Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Place the target colored into each column.\n4. **Fill Down**: Replicate the column values down.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts the vertical lines of blue, red, and yellow from the input grid, disregards the grey square and background, and represents these lines in a smaller, condensed output grid, maintaining their relative horizontal positions. The right-most values among target-colored are extracted and filled down.\n"
