The output grid seems to be composed of select, complete horizontal lines from the input grid. The colors in the output grid are present in the input grid. The lines selected are not all adjacent, lines have been skipped or culled. Lines of all zeros are not present in the output. The selected lines appear to be ones of a uniform single color.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
