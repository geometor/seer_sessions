general:
  - The output grid always consists of solid color lines that also exist in the input grid.
  - The output grid's height is equal to the number of solid color lines in the input grid, excluding those of color 0.
  - The output grid's width is consistent within each example, but varies across examples.
  - The order of solid color lines in the output matches the order in the input.
