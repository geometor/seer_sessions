Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 12x10 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains several distinct colored regions: a gray square, a blue vertical line, a red vertical line, and a yellow vertical line. The output grid seems to extract only the blue, red, and yellow colors, maintaining their relative horizontal positions. The gray square and white background are ignored. The output grid appears to take the right-most occurrence of non-background and non-gray pixels from each column.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 12x10
    elements:
      - color: white  # 0
        type: background
      - color: blue  # 1
        shape: vertical_line
      - color: red   # 2
        shape: vertical_line
      - color: green # 3
        shape: none # not present
      - color: yellow #4
        shape: vertical_line
      - color: gray #5
        shape: square

  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: blue # 1
      - color: red # 2
      - color: yellow #4

relations:
  - input_grid contains multiple colored_regions
  - output_grid represents a condensed version of input_grid
  - output_grid preserves the horizontal order of colored_lines (blue, red, yellow)

actions:
  - select: colors blue, red, and yellow from input.
  - ignore: colors white and gray.
  - condense: reduce grid height and width.
  - locate: position of the colored lines in input and output, maintaining
    order.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** Focus on the blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. Ignore white (0) and grey(5).
2.  **Locate Columns:** For each column in the input grid that contains at least one of the target colored, record the right-most value of target colored.
3.  **Construct Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Place the target colored into each column.
4. **Fill Down**: Replicate the column values down.

In essence, the transformation extracts the vertical lines of blue, red, and yellow from the input grid, disregards the grey square and background, and represents these lines in a smaller, condensed output grid, maintaining their relative horizontal positions. The right-most values among target-colored are extracted and filled down.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
