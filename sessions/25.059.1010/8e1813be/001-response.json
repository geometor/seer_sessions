The input grids are generally larger and more complex than the output grids. The output grids seem to be a simplified or extracted version of the input grids, retaining only certain colors and often reducing the overall size. The background is always white (0). There are distinct colored regions or \"objects.\"\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Also the colors should be unique. For example, if color 2 appears twice as complete rows, ignore them.\n2.  **Extract Rows:** For each target color identified, extract *one* full row of that color from the input grid. The width of the extracted row should be the same as the number of non-zero pixels in the original row.\n3.  **Compose Output:** Stack the extracted rows vertically, in the order they appear top-to-bottom in the input, to create the output grid.\n\nIn summary, the process finds rows that are solid blocks of the *same* color (not background) and are unique within the input grid, extracts one instance of those rows, removes background, and combines.\n"
