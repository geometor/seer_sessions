Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming grids of colored pixels. The input grids are generally larger and more complex than the output grids. The output grids seem to be a simplified or extracted version of the input grids, retaining only certain colors and often reducing the overall size. The background is always white (0). There are distinct colored regions or "objects."

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - cells: colored pixels (0-9)
  - type: colored_region
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - shape: contiguous block

actions:
  - select:
    description: Identify specific colored regions.
    criteria:
      - color: not 0 (background)
      - uniqueness: appears only once in each input
      - complete row: occupies a full horizontal line on the grid, might only be part of a row.
  - extract:
      description: Copy the selected colored regions
  - compose:
    description: Arrange the extracted regions into a new grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid_contains: colored_regions
  - output_grid_composed_of: extracted_colored_regions
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** Examine the input grid and identify the colors that *completely fill one or more rows, and where the remaining pixels on that row are all 0*. Also the colors should be unique. For example, if color 2 appears twice as complete rows, ignore them.
2.  **Extract Rows:** For each target color identified, extract *one* full row of that color from the input grid. The width of the extracted row should be the same as the number of non-zero pixels in the original row.
3.  **Compose Output:** Stack the extracted rows vertically, in the order they appear top-to-bottom in the input, to create the output grid.

In summary, the process finds rows that are solid blocks of the *same* color (not background) and are unique within the input grid, extracts one instance of those rows, removes background, and combines.
