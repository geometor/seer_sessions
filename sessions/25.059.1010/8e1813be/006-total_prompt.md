Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all horizontal lines (rows) in the input grid that consist of a single, uniform color. We can refer to these as "solid color lines".
2.  **Exclude** any solid color lines where the color is 0 (white/background).
3. **Select:** select the solid colored lines.
4.  **Construct** the output grid by vertically stacking the selected solid color lines, in the order that they appeared in the input grid.

import numpy as np

def is_solid_color_line(line):
    """Checks if a line (list) contains only one unique non-zero value."""
    unique_values = np.unique(line)
    return len(unique_values) == 1 and unique_values[0] != 0

def transform(input_grid):

    selected_lines = []

    # Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    for row in input_grid:
        # Check if the current row is a solid color line (excluding 0).
        if is_solid_color_line(row):
            selected_lines.append(row)

    # Construct the output grid by vertically stacking the selected lines.
    # If no lines were selected, return an empty grid (or handle as appropriate).
    if not selected_lines:
      return np.array([])

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code and refine the natural language program and observations.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program focused on identifying and stacking horizontal solid color lines (excluding white). This approach worked for the first example, but failed on subsequent examples. The primary issue is that the transformation is more specific than just stacking all non-white solid color lines. The restriction of length to 6 and the specific case the empty array are clues, but not descriptive. We need to determine exactly which solid-colored lines are kept and what their length should be. It appears the code should focus on matching the dimensions of a specific part of the output and apply those to extract the relevant portions of the input.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Examine All Examples:** Carefully analyze all input-output pairs, not just the first one.
2.  **Identify Output Dimensions:** Determine the dimensions of the output grids and how the lines within the output relate to the input, including length.
3.  **Refine Selection Criteria:** Determine *which* solid color lines are selected. It's not all of them, and color alone isn't sufficient. Position might be a factor.
4.  **Adjust Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to accurately reflect the refined selection and construction process.
5.  **Test and Iterate:** After updating the program, re-run the code and check the results. Iterate on this process.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To better understand the patterns, I'll use a `code_execution` block to collect metrics about each example. I will focus on the presence, number, and colors of solid color lines in both input and output.

```python
import numpy as np

def is_solid_color_line(line):
    """Checks if a line (list) contains only one unique non-zero value."""
    unique_values = np.unique(line)
    return len(unique_values) == 1 and unique_values[0] != 0

    results = []
    for example in task_data['train']:
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])

        input_solid_lines = []
        for i, row in enumerate(input_grid):
            if is_solid_color_line(row):
                input_solid_lines.append((i, row[0]))  # (row index, color)

        output_solid_lines = []
        for i, row in enumerate(output_grid):
            if is_solid_color_line(row):
                output_solid_lines.append((i, row[0])) # (row index, color)

        example_data = {
            'input_shape': input_grid.shape,
            'output_shape': output_grid.shape,
            'input_solid_lines': input_solid_lines,
            'output_solid_lines': output_solid_lines,
            'output_line_length': output_grid.shape[1] if len(output_grid) > 0 else 0,

        }
        results.append(example_data)
    return results

# the task data will be provided later when this block is executed in a notebook
# the notebook will define task_data
# for local dev, it can be initialized to an empty dict like this:
# task_data = {}
if 'task_data' not in locals():
    task_data = {}
    print("WARNING: `task_data` not found, initializing to empty {}.  This is expected behavior for local development, but not in the SEER evaluation notebook environment".format(task_data))
else:
  analysis_results = analyze_examples(task_data)
  print (analysis_results)
```

general:
  - The output grid always consists of solid color lines that also exist in the input grid.
  - The output grid's height is equal to the number of solid color lines in the input grid, excluding those of color 0.
  - The output grid's width is consistent within each example, but varies across examples.
  - The order of solid color lines in the output matches the order in the input.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Find all horizontal lines (rows) in the input grid that consist of a single, uniform color. These are the "solid color lines".
2.  **Exclude:** Ignore any solid color lines where the color is 0 (white/background).
3.  **Select:** From the solid colored lines, select those that match the row indices of solid colored lines in the output.
4.  **Determine Output Length:** Observe the length of the lines in the output grid. This length is consistent for all lines within a single example.
5.  **Construct:** Create the output grid by taking the selected solid color lines from the input grid. Truncate or pad (with what?) each line to match the determined output length. In the examples, the lines are simply truncated.

Based on these observations, it's clear now that the key is to recognize that we are extracting specific solid-colored lines from the input to make the output, and the width of the output grid dictates the length of the lines in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
