Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule filters rows from the input grid based on the first element of each row. Rows starting with 0 or 5 are removed. The remaining rows are included in the output grid *as they are*, without modification and preserving their original order.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid by selecting rows that do not start with 0 or 5, preserving original row content."""

    # Convert input_grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Initialize an empty list to store the selected rows
    selected_rows = []

    # Iterate through each row of the input array
    for row in input_array:
        # Check if the first element of the row is not 0 and not 5
        if row[0] != 0 and row[0] != 5:
            # If the condition is met, append the *entire* row to the selected_rows list
            selected_rows.append(row)

    # Convert the list of selected rows to a NumPy array
    output_array = np.array(selected_rows)

    return output_array.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program focused on filtering rows based on the first element (0 or 5). While this worked for the first example, it's clear from the other examples that this rule is not universally applicable. The core issue is that the transformation rule is more complex and likely involves conditions beyond just the first element of each row.

My strategy will be:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to *all* differences, not just the presence or absence of rows.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for consistent patterns across *all* examples. The initial rule might be a *part* of the solution, but it's almost certainly not the whole story.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Develop a new natural language program that accurately describes the transformation observed across *all* training examples. This may involve incorporating more complex conditions or different types of operations.
4. Document observations as facts, focusing on the context of the transformation, object identification, and their attributes.
5. **Prepare for Code Modification:** The refined natural language description should be detailed enough to prepare for the next phase, revising the Python code.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To get a more quantitative and systematic understanding, I'll perform the
following on each example:

*   Count the number of rows and columns in both input and output.
*   List the values in the first column of both input and output.
*   Note any other specific observations.

Here's a breakdown of the results and observations:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** 6 rows, 5 columns. First column: `[7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 5]`
*   **Output:** 4 rows, 5 columns. First column: `[7, 7, 7, 7]`
*   **Observation:** Rows starting with 0 and 5 are removed, as per the original logic.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** 6 rows, 11 columns. First column: `[1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1]`
*   **Output:** 3 rows, 11 columns. First column: `[1, 1, 1]`
*   **Observation:** Rows starting with 0 and 5 are removed.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** 7 rows, 7 columns. First column: `[8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 0]`
*   **Output:** 2 rows, 7 columns. First column: `[8, 8]`
*   **Observation:** Rows starting with 0 and 5 are removed.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation rule consistently removes rows based on the value of the first element in each row.
  - condition: |
      Rows starting with the value 0 are removed.
  - condition: |
      Rows starting with the value 5 are removed.
  - input_grid_properties:
      - The input is a 2D grid of varying dimensions.
      - Grid cells contain integer values representing colors.
  - output_grid_properties:
    - row_count: The number of rows in the output grid is always less than or equal to the input grid.
    - col_count: The output has same number of columns.
  - object_identification: |
      Each row of the grid can be considered an object.
  - object_attribute: |
      The first element of each row is a key attribute determining its inclusion or exclusion in the output.
  - action: |
     Rows that do not start with the value 0 or 5 are retained.
```

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation rule filters rows of the input grid based on the value of their first element. If a row starts with either 0 or 5, it is removed. Otherwise, the row is kept. The order of the remaining rows, and all the columns and their values are preserved in the output. The output grid contains only the rows that satisfy this condition.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
