            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the observation that the orange pixel (color 7) expands horizontally to become a three-pixel-wide object, centered on the original pixel. This holds true for some cases but fails in others. The primary issue is that the provided code *always* extends the orange object horizontally, regardless of its initial size or the context of surrounding pixels. We need to refine the rule to account for cases where the orange object is *already* wider, or the expansion is different.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I'll examine each input/output pair, noting the specific changes in the orange object's size and position.\n2.  **Error Categorization:** I'll classify the errors. Are they due to:\n    *   Incorrect expansion width?\n    *   Expansion in the wrong direction?\n    *   Missing expansion?\n    *   Expansion applied to an existing block\n3. **Metrics gathering** execute the code on each input, and compare that result with the expected.\n4.  **Rule Refinement:** Based on the error analysis, I will update the natural language program to be more precise and cover all observed cases.\n5.  **YAML Documentation:** I'll create a YAML block summarizing the observed facts about objects, properties, and actions.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Example Analysis:**\n\nTo do this effectively I need to perform some operations to programmatically compare the results. Since I can't execute the code I have to state my assumptions.\nThe first assumption, is that the python function works exactly as described in the initial comment, taking the input, identifying the orange pixel and setting the left and right adjacet pixels to orange.\nHere is the analysis (without code execution, relying on visual inspection of the provided data and the description of the code's behavior):\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Single orange pixel.\n    *   Expected Output: Three-pixel-wide orange line.\n    *   Actual Output (assumed): Three-pixel-wide orange line.\n    *   Result: **Correct.**\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Two horizontal orange pixels.\n    *   Expected Output: Four horizontal orange pixels\n    *   Actual Output (assumed): Four-pixel-wide orange line (the two original, and one to the left of the left-most, one to the right of the right-most).\n    *   Result: **Correct.**\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    Input: Three horizontal orange pixels.\n    *    Expected Output: Five horizontal orange pixels\n    *    Actual output (assumed): Five-pixel-wide orange line\n    *    Result: **Correct**\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *    Input: Four horizontal orange pixels.\n    *    Expected Output: Six horizontal orange pixels\n    *    Actual output (assumed): Six-pixel-wide orange line\n    *    Result: **Correct**\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: orange_region\n    type: contiguous_horizontal_line\n    initial_length: variable  # Length of the initial orange region\n    transformation: extend_both_sides\n    extension_amount: add one pixel to each end of original\n    final_length: initial_length + 2\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify** all horizontal contiguous regions of orange (color 7) pixels.\n2.  **For each** identified orange region, extend it by one pixel on both the left and right sides. Ensure that pixels are only added, and none are removed. If extending to the left or right would result in an attempt to address an invalid location, simply do not add the pixel to that side.\n3. **All** other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.\n\n"
