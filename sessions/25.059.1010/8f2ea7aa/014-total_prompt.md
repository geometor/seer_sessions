    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the observation that the orange pixel (color 7) expands horizontally to become a three-pixel-wide object, centered on the original pixel. This holds true for some cases but fails in others. The primary issue is that the provided code *always* extends the orange object horizontally, regardless of its initial size or the context of surrounding pixels. We need to refine the rule to account for cases where the orange object is *already* wider, or the expansion is different.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I'll examine each input/output pair, noting the specific changes in the orange object's size and position.
2.  **Error Categorization:** I'll classify the errors. Are they due to:
    *   Incorrect expansion width?
    *   Expansion in the wrong direction?
    *   Missing expansion?
    *   Expansion applied to an existing block
3. **Metrics gathering** execute the code on each input, and compare that result with the expected.
4.  **Rule Refinement:** Based on the error analysis, I will update the natural language program to be more precise and cover all observed cases.
5.  **YAML Documentation:** I'll create a YAML block summarizing the observed facts about objects, properties, and actions.

**Metrics Gathering and Example Analysis:**

To do this effectively I need to perform some operations to programmatically compare the results. Since I can't execute the code I have to state my assumptions.
The first assumption, is that the python function works exactly as described in the initial comment, taking the input, identifying the orange pixel and setting the left and right adjacet pixels to orange.
Here is the analysis (without code execution, relying on visual inspection of the provided data and the description of the code's behavior):

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Single orange pixel.
    *   Expected Output: Three-pixel-wide orange line.
    *   Actual Output (assumed): Three-pixel-wide orange line.
    *   Result: **Correct.**

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Two horizontal orange pixels.
    *   Expected Output: Four horizontal orange pixels
    *   Actual Output (assumed): Four-pixel-wide orange line (the two original, and one to the left of the left-most, one to the right of the right-most).
    *   Result: **Correct.**

*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input: Three horizontal orange pixels.
    *    Expected Output: Five horizontal orange pixels
    *    Actual output (assumed): Five-pixel-wide orange line
    *    Result: **Correct**

*   **Example 4:**
    *    Input: Four horizontal orange pixels.
    *    Expected Output: Six horizontal orange pixels
    *    Actual output (assumed): Six-pixel-wide orange line
    *    Result: **Correct**

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: orange_region
    type: contiguous_horizontal_line
    initial_length: variable  # Length of the initial orange region
    transformation: extend_both_sides
    extension_amount: add one pixel to each end of original
    final_length: initial_length + 2

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all horizontal contiguous regions of orange (color 7) pixels.
2.  **For each** identified orange region, extend it by one pixel on both the left and right sides. Ensure that pixels are only added, and none are removed. If extending to the left or right would result in an attempt to address an invalid location, simply do not add the pixel to that side.
3. **All** other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
