def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by mirroring the orange pixels across horizontal, vertical, and diagonal axes.

    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a reasonable hypothesis (mirroring orange pixels), but it's clearly incomplete. The provided results show discrepancies between the expected outputs and the outputs generated by the `transform` function. The core issue seems to be that the mirroring logic isn't fully capturing the intended transformation. The original hypothesis assumes that the orange object and the mirrored image is always orange, which is not true. It's not just mirroring the orange; other colors and even multiple objects are involved. The existing code only mirrors orange pixels and doesn't account for other colors or the overall structure of the objects.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Observation:** Carefully examine *all* input-output pairs, not just the first one. Identify all objects and colors.
2.  **Object Identification:** Determine what constitutes an "object" in each case (contiguous pixels of the same color, specific shapes, etc.).
3.  **Relationship Analysis:**  Analyze the relationships between objects in the input and how they change in the output. Is it a simple mirroring, a more complex transformation, or perhaps even involves a change in the surrounding pixels?
4.  **Color Changes:** Pay close attention to any color changes that occur during the transformation. The previous code assumed that only orange pixels were relevant, but other colors might also be affected.
5.  **Refine Hypothesis:** Based on the extended example analysis, refine the initial mirroring hypothesis or propose a new one that accounts for all observations.
6.  **Iterative Improvement:** Test and validate.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To accurately describe the transformations, I need to understand the shapes, colors, and relative positions. I will use numpy to help with the comparison.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    description = {
        'shape': (rows, cols),
        'colors': {},
        'objects': []
    }
    for color in np.unique(grid):
        description['colors'][int(color)] = np.sum(grid == color)

    # Simple object detection: contiguous blocks of the same color
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r, c]:
                color = grid[r, c]
                object_coords = []
                stack = [(r, c)]
                while stack:
                    curr_r, curr_c = stack.pop()
                    if 0 <= curr_r < rows and 0 <= curr_c < cols and grid[curr_r, curr_c] == color and not visited[curr_r, curr_c]:
                        visited[curr_r, curr_c] = True
                        object_coords.append((curr_r, curr_c))
                        stack.extend([(curr_r + 1, curr_c), (curr_r - 1, curr_c), (curr_r, curr_c + 1), (curr_r, curr_c - 1)])
                if object_coords:
                  description['objects'].append({
                      'color': int(color),
                      'coordinates': object_coords,
                      'size': len(object_coords)
                  })

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
