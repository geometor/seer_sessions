Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing numerical values representing colors. The primary colors observed are azure (8) and white (0). The input grid appears to have a pattern of azure pixels, which is altered in the output grid. The overall size of the grid remains consistent, but the position and number of azure pixels change.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_elements:
  objects:
    - type: grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: 9x9
        - cells: contain numerical values (colors)
    - type: pixel
      properties:
        - color: azure (8)
        - color: white (0)
        - position: (row, column)
  actions:
    - type: move
      description: Pixels change their position.
    - type: replicate
      description: The number of azure pixels increases.
    - type: shift
      description: translate the mirrored set
  relationships:
    - input_grid: contains initial arrangement of pixels
    - output_grid: contains transformed arrangement of pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify**: Find all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Mirror**: For each azure pixel at position (r, c), create a mirrored pixel at position (r, 9-1-c), i.e., by mirroring each column about a vertical line drawn through the very middle of the grid (column #4 for a grid with 9 columns)
3. **Shift Down and Right**: Move all the original and mirrored positions, down and right, one grid unit
4. **Wrap**: If an original element hits the bottom, top or right-most border when moved, wrap down and right one unit


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
