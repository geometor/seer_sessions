Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors). The primary color involved is orange (7), with the background being white (0). The transformation seems to involve some form of mirroring or reflection of the orange objects, both horizontally and vertically, and perhaps diagonally. The shape formed by the orange pixels is altered significantly.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: orange_pixels
    properties:
      color: orange (7)
      shape: irregular, changes during transformation
      initial_location: center of the grid
    actions:
      - mirrored: across horizontal, vertical, and possibly diagonal axes
      - replicated
    relationships:
      - adjacent_to: other orange pixels, forming a contiguous shape
      - background: white pixels (0)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Orange Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value 7 (orange) in the input grid.

2.  **Mirror/Reflect:** Reflect all orange pixels across a horizontal axis passing through the middle of the grid and separately do a reflection across a vertical axis through the middle of the grid. Place the orange pixels into locations on the grid based on mirroring these coordinates.

3.  **Combine:** Mirror all orange pixels again but on the diagonal that runs from the top right to bottom left, and also on the diagonal axis that runs from the top left to the bottom right. Place the orange pixels into locations on the grid based on mirroring these coordinates.

4.  **Output:** The output grid consists of mirrored pixels.

In simpler terms, the orange shape in the input is mirrored or reflected both vertically, horizontally, and diagonally to generate the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
