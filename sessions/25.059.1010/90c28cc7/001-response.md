Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grids are composed of colored blocks. Each block is a contiguous region of pixels with the same color. The colors correspond to digits 0-9. The output grids are significantly smaller and seem to represent a simplified version of the input, highlighting certain features or properties of the colored blocks.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: Block
    properties:
      - color: int (0-9)
      - shape: rectangle
      - size: area (number of pixels)
      - position: (row, col) #top-left
    actions:
      - identified: The presence of a distinct color block.
    relationships:
      - adjacent_to: Other blocks.

transformation:
  - type: Summarization/Sampling
  - method: Representative Pixel
  - criteria:
     -distinct_colors: unique colors in the blocks
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Distinct Blocks:** In the input grid, identify all distinct rectangular blocks of color. A block is defined as a contiguous region of pixels sharing the same color.
2. **Find Representative Colors:** find all the distinct colors.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid where the dimensions depends on number of distinct colors found in the previous step.
4. **Populate with Colors**: populate output grid cells with the colors found in the step 2, it seems that the colors should respect the y axis of the blocks in the original figure.

In summary, the transformation identifies the distinct color blocks in the input grid and represents them on x,y grid in the output grid, the output grid represent the position of the first occurrence (top,left) of each different color.
