Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code assumes the existence of exactly four distinct colored blocks arranged in a 2x2 configuration. It identifies these blocks, orders them based on their top-left corner, and then extracts their colors into a 2x2 output grid. This approach works for some cases but fails when the input doesn't conform to this specific 2x2 block structure. The core issue is the rigid assumption about the input structure, and find_blocks will combine adjacent block of the same color.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**
1.  **Relax the 2x2 assumption:** The transformation rule needs to be more general and not strictly dependent on finding four distinct 2x2 blocks.
2.  **Focus on color extraction:** The core operation seems to be about identifying specific color arrangements rather than whole block structures. We might consider extracting the colors at certain relative positions.
3. **Consider position and adjacency:** Look for repeating structural elements that are common to all the input/output examples.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To understand the patterns, I'll analyze each input-output pair, focusing on identifying the relationship between them. I won't use `code_execution` here, as manual inspection is more insightful at this stage, and I want to reason about the *why* behind the failures.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 6x5 grid. Four distinct color blocks (blue, red, green, yellow) in a 2x2 configuration.
    *   Output: 2x2 grid with the same colors in the same arrangement.
    *   Code Result: Correct.
    *   Observation: The initial assumption holds.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 7x7 grid. Several colored pixels, but not arranged in distinct 2x2 blocks of single colors.
    *    Output: 2x2 grid
    *   Code Result: Incorrect, output is \[\[0,0],\[0,0]]
    *    Observation: The assumption does not hold. We should look for the repeating structure.
*    **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 9x9 Grid. Four 3x3 color blocks in a 2x2 configuration
    *    Output: 2x2 grid of those colors
    *    Code Result: Correct.
    *    Observation: The initial assumption that blocks are found even when adjacent pixels are the same color.
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: 11x11 grid. Four 4x4 color squares arranged in a 2x2 structure.
    *   Output: 2x2 grid with the colors from the input.
    *   Code Result: Correct.
    *   Observation: The 2x2 color arrangement is key, the function `find_blocks` correctly combines areas of the same color.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - contains_colors: [blue, red, green, yellow, black]
      - varying_size: true
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - size: [2, 2]
      - colors_from_input: true
  - object: color_blocks
    type: regions
    properties:
       - arranged_2x2: True
  - action: extract_colors
    description: Colors from the input 2x2 arrangement are extracted.
  - action: create_output
    description: A 2x2 output grid is created using the extracted colors.
  - constant: output_size
    value: [2,2]

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the 2x2 Arrangement:** In the input grid, locate the largest 2x2 arrangement of four distinct color regions or blocks. It doesn't matter how big these color areas, but they must form the four sections of a 2x2 structure where the top left section is adjacent to the top right and bottom left, and the bottom left is adjacent to the bottom right.
2.  **Extract Colors:** Note the color of each of the four sections: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right.
3.  **Create Output:** Construct a 2x2 output grid.
4.  **Populate Output:** Fill the output grid with the colors extracted in step 2, maintaining the same relative positions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).

This revised natural language program avoids the strict "four distinct blocks" assumption and focuses on the core 2x2 color arrangement, which seems consistent across all successful examples. The `find_blocks` function should work, as written, because of how it combines areas of the same color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
