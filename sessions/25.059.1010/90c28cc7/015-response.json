The output is a much smaller grid (3x2) or a list of pairs of numbers. The input grid appears to be composed of four distinct rectangular blocks of color arranged in a 2x2 pattern. Each block has a unique color (azure, red, green, yellow, blue). The output seems to represent a summary of the input, distilling each colored block into a pair of numbers. The key is that each colored rectangle is represented by its colors. It appears that the upper left corner colors are listed, followed by the upper right, then the lower left, etc.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
