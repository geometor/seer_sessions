Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (21x21) composed of different colored blocks. The output is a much smaller grid (3x3) that seems to represent a summary or a distilled version of the input. The colors in the input grid appear in horizontal bands or stripes, and each band consists of a single repeating color for an extended stretch before transitioning. The output grid seems to capture a single representative color from each of these bands. The background is all 0 (white) but the program is not expected to copy it to the output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [21, 21] # Input grid dimensions
      colors: [0, 8, 7, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5]  # Colors present in the input
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3] # Output grid dimensions
      colors: [8, 7, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5] # Colors present in the output

actions:
  - type: summarize
    description: Condense the input grid into a smaller output grid.
    method:  Extract a representative color from each distinct horizontal color band.

relationships:
  - type: represents
    description: Each cell in the output grid represents a distinct color band in the input grid.
    mapping:  Output grid row corresponds to input grid color bands from top down.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Distinct Color Bands:** Divide the input grid into horizontal bands, where each band is defined by a contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color. Ignore all rows which have color 0 (white) only.
2.  **Extract Representative Color:** For each identified color band, take the first non-zero color encountered.
3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Fill each row of this output grid with the representative colors extracted from each input color band, maintaining the top-down order. The output grid will therefore have as many rows as distinct and non-white horizontal bands.

Essentially, the transformation extracts the first non-zero color in each solid horizontal color band of the input grid, ignoring rows of all 0, and places these colors into a smaller output grid, maintaining the original order.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
