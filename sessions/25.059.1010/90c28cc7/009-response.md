Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (21x21) filled primarily with '0' (white) pixels. Within this grid, there are four distinct rectangular blocks of color: red (2), azure (8), blue (1), and yellow (4). These blocks are arranged in a 2x2 pattern, occupying the central area of the grid. The output is a much smaller 2x2 grid, with each cell containing a single digit corresponding to the color of the respective block in the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [21, 21] # Input grid dimensions
      background_color: 0  # White
  - type: block
    properties:
      shape: rectangle
      arrangement: 2x2 grid
    sub_objects:
      - id: block_1
        color: 2  # Red
        position: top-left
      - id: block_2
        color: 8  # Azure
        position: top-right
      - id: block_3
        color: 1  # Blue
        position: bottom-left
      - id: block_4
        color: 4  # Yellow
        position: bottom-right
  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [2, 2]
      cell_values: [2, 8, 1, 4] # Correspond to block colors

actions:
    - type: extract_color
      description: Extract the color value of each distinct block
      agent: system

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Input blocks are arranged in a 2x2 grid within the larger input grid.
  - type: correspondence
    description: Each cell in the output grid corresponds to a block in the input grid, representing its color.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blocks:** Within the input grid, identify four distinct rectangular blocks of color arranged in a 2x2 configuration.
2.  **Determine Colors:** Note the color value of each block.
3.   **Order blocks:** Order these from top left to bottom right
4.  **Create Output:** Create a 2x2 output grid.
5.  **Populate Output:** Fill each cell of the output grid with the color value of the corresponding block from the input grid, maintaining the 2x2 arrangement (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).

In simpler terms, the transformation extracts the color values of four blocks arranged in a 2x2 grid within the input and represents them in a smaller 2x2 output grid, preserving the spatial arrangement.
