Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Frame Identification:**
    *   Examine the input grid to identify the presence of an outer rectangular frame composed primarily of yellow (color 4) pixels, but possibly containing other colors, embedded in a consistent pattern.
    *   The frame must define a clear rectangular inner region.

2.  **Inner Region Determination:**
    *   Once a frame is identified, determine the boundaries (top-left and bottom-right) of the inner rectangular region enclosed by the frame.

3.  **Output Grid Creation:**
    *   Calculate the dimensions of the output grid. The output grid's height and width are each half the height and width of the inner region, respectively (integer division by 2).

4.  **Region Condensation and Color Mapping:**
    *   Iterate through 2x2 pixel blocks within the inner region of the input grid.
    *   For each 2x2 block, map it to a single pixel in the corresponding position of the output grid.
    *   **Color Selection Logic:** Within each 2x2 block:
        *   If all pixels are the same color, the output pixel takes that color.
        *   If the pixels are a mix of colors apply this rule: The colors in the 2x2 region in the input are evaluated, and the most prevalent color is used in the output, excluding black(0). If there is a tie, the color that appears the most number of times in the bottom right of the input region is used.

5.  **No Frame Handling:**
    * If step one does not find a valid border, do not modify the grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a revised natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying a yellow frame, extracting the inner region, and downscaling it by a factor of 2, selecting the most prevalent color in each 2x2 block. The results on the other examples indicate that this approach has several limitations:

1.  **Frame Assumption:** The code assumes the existence of a yellow frame. This is not true for all examples. The concept of a "frame" needs to be generalized or removed if it's not a consistent feature. A more generalized border detection may be required, not limited to the color yellow.
2.  **Downscaling Logic:** While the 2x2 downscaling works for some examples, it's not universally applicable. We need to examine cases where the output dimensions are different and derive a more general rule for determining output size.
3.  **Color Selection:** The most prevalent color logic, while working for the tie-breaker, does not define the entire transformation. The presence of lines in a grid suggests some other selection logic.

**Strategy for Improvement**

1.  **Broaden Frame/Border Detection:** Instead of looking specifically for yellow, we should look for *any* consistent border pattern, possibly of any color, or abandon the frame concept.
2.  **Generalized Output Size Determination:** Investigate how the input and output dimensions relate across all examples. Look for patterns beyond simple halving.
3. **Refine Content Logic:** We need a new rule for color selection, the current one is incomplete.
4. **Iterative Refinement:** Use each example to test and modify the natural program and code, testing to see which inputs succeed and which fail.

**Metrics and Example Analysis (using code execution for verification)**

```python
def analyze_results(task):
    correct_count = 0
    print(f"Task: {task['name']}")
    for example in task['train']:
        input_grid = example['input']
        expected_output = example['output']
        predicted_output = transform(input_grid)

        if np.array_equal(predicted_output, expected_output):
            correct_count += 1
            print(f"  Example {example['index']} - PASS")
        else:
            print(f"  Example {example['index']} - FAIL")
            print(f"    Input: {np.array(input_grid).shape} - {input_grid}")
            print(f"    Expected Output: {np.array(expected_output).shape} - {expected_output}")
            print(f"    Predicted Output: {np.array(predicted_output).shape} - {predicted_output}")
    print(f"  Passed {correct_count} of {len(task['train'])} examples")

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
task: d2abd087
objects:
  - id: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels, each pixel represented by a single digit integer.
    properties:
      - height: varies (15 in examples)
      - width: varies (15 in examples)
      - values: integers from 0 to 9, representing colors

  - id: line
    description: A sequence of one or more pixels, vertically or horizontally
    properties:
      - orientation:
          type: enum
          values: [vertical, horizontal]
      - color: the color of the line

actions:
  - id: fill
    description: Fills an area
    properties:
        - color: The color to apply.
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Lines:** Examine the input grid. Identify any horizontal or vertical lines that extend from one edge to another. A line consists of a series of adjacent pixels of the same color. The line can begin at any position along an edge.
2.  **Fill Inside of Lines:** Examine the pixels inside (not a part of) the lines.
3.  **Color Selection:** Replace the color of any pixels inside of lines with the color of the line.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
