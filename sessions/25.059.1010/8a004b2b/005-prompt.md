Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Frame Identification:**
    *   Examine the input grid to identify the presence of an outer rectangular frame composed primarily of yellow (color 4) pixels, but possibly containing other colors, embedded in a consistent pattern.
    *   The frame must define a clear rectangular inner region.

2.  **Inner Region Determination:**
    *   Once a frame is identified, determine the boundaries (top-left and bottom-right) of the inner rectangular region enclosed by the frame.

3.  **Output Grid Creation:**
    *   Calculate the dimensions of the output grid. The output grid's height and width are each half the height and width of the inner region, respectively (integer division by 2).

4.  **Region Condensation and Color Mapping:**
    *   Iterate through 2x2 pixel blocks within the inner region of the input grid.
    *   For each 2x2 block, map it to a single pixel in the corresponding position of the output grid.
    *   **Color Selection Logic:** Within each 2x2 block:
        *   If all pixels are the same color, the output pixel takes that color.
        *   If the pixels are a mix of colors apply this rule: The colors in the 2x2 region in the input are evaluated, and the most prevalent color is used in the output, excluding black(0). If there is a tie, the color that appears the most number of times in the bottom right of the input region is used.

5.  **No Frame Handling:**
    * If step one does not find a valid border, do not modify the grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
