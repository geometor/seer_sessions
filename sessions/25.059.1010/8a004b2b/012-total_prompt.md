```python
"""
1.  **Bounding Box:** Find the smallest rectangular region (bounding box) that encompasses all non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid. This is defined by the topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost non-white pixels.

2.  **Horizontal Blue Connection:** Within the bounding box, locate all blue (1) rectangles. If two blue rectangles are on the same row and every pixel between them is white (0), connect them by filling the intermediate pixels with blue (1). If any pixel in between is not white, do not connect.

3. **Vertical Blue Merge:** Within the bounding box, locate all blue (1) rectangles. If two blue rectangles are vertically contiguous, merge them.

4.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All non-blue and non-white pixels within the bounding box must be preserved in the output grid, maintaining their exact relative positions and sizes.

5.  **Output Grid:** Create a new grid based on the bounding box size. Populate it by performing the blue connection/merging, and preserving other colors as described above.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program and approach accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, focusing on identifying blue objects, connecting them horizontally, and merging them vertically. However, the provided examples and results show that the current approach is insufficient. Specifically we need to consider these points:

1.  **Bounding Box:** The initial bounding box concept needs refinement. The results are mixed - on example 3, the bounding box appears to be including white pixels in the input.
2.  **Horizontal Connection:** The horizontal connection of blue objects appears to be working as intended.
3.  **Vertical Merge** The vertical merge of blue objects only merges single pixel objects.
4. **Output Grid** The program creates a new grid and copies the transformed bounding box.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To better understand the errors, I'll perform a more detailed analysis of each example.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 4x7 grid with two blue 1x1 blocks in the first row, and a single red 1x1 block on the third row.
    *   Expected Output: 4x7 grid with a single blue 1x7 block in the first row, and the single red 1x1 block on the third row.
    *   Actual Output: 1x6 grid with the blue blocks connected. The bounding box did not include the entire row and column of the input objects. The red block was not included in the output.
    *   **Observations:** The code correctly connected the blue horizontally. It did *not* correctly copy the other non-blue pixels and did not preserve all the rows of the input.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 7x7 grid. Several blue rectangles, various sizes (1x1, 2x1, 3x1, 1x2, 2x2). A single 1x1 green pixel and a single 1x1 orange pixel.
    *   Expected Output: 7x7 grid with blue rectangles merged vertically and connected horizontally where applicable.
    *   Actual Output: 6x6. The 1x1 green pixel is removed - The bounding box is slightly too restrictive. Blue blocks connected/merged correctly where applicable.
    *   **Observations:** The code correctly connected horizontally. It correctly merged vertically. Other non-blue colors *were* preserved in some cases.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 15x16. Several blue rectangles of various sizes. Several other single-pixel colors.
    *   Expected Output: 15x16. Blue rectangles connected and merged.
    *   Actual Output: 15x16 grid. Correct connection and merging.
    *   **Observations:** Performs perfectly.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate Rows:** Process each row of the input grid from top to bottom.

2.  **Horizontal Blue Connection:** Within each row, locate all blue (1) pixels. If two blue pixels are on the same row and all pixels between them are white (0), connect them by changing the intermediate white pixels to blue (1).

3.  **Iterate Columns:** After processing all rows, iterate through the grid by columns, from left to right.

4.  **Vertical Blue Merge:** Within each column, locate all blue pixels. Merge adjacent blocks.

5. **Preserve All Pixels** during the row and column operations, preserve all pixels by copying the input to the output.

6.  **Output:** The output grid should be the same dimensions as the input grid, with the transformations applied.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
