Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of non-zero colored pixels and single non-zero pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Fill Rows:** For each row in the grid, find the right-most non-zero pixel. Fill all pixels to the left of this pixel with the same color.
3.  **Reposition Yellow Pixels:** Find all single pixels of color 4 (yellow). Move these pixels to the corners of the grid. The corners are filled in this order: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right. If there are more yellow pixels than corners, leave the extra yellow pixels in place. If a corner is not background, move to the next corner.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
