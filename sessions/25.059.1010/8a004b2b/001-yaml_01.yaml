facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids contain colored objects (contiguous blocks of same-colored pixels).
  - observation: Output grids seem to represent a simplified or combined version of the objects in the input grid.
  - observation: There is a frame of "4" (yellow color) in the corner.
  - observation: the size of the output grid seems to be related with the frame defined by 4.
  - observation: Pixels with value 0 in the input seem to be largely ignored in the output, except for maintaining overall shape.
  - observation: Connected regions of non-zero pixels inside the yellow frame, are merged together in the output.
  - observation: Regions of adjacent and diagonally touching pixels inside the frame are maintained or combined.
