Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying colored rectangular blocks and placing them in a new grid, prioritizing yellow blocks as "bookends" to determine the output grid size. The subsequent tests show that this approach doesn't fully capture the transformation rules for all cases. Specifically, there's a need to handle cases where the input does not have yellow blocks, as well as other edge cases.

The strategy will involve the following:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine the input and output grids of each training example, along with the results of the current code.
2.  **Identify Discrepancies:** Pinpoint where the code's output differs from the expected output.
3.  **Refine Transformation Rules:** Update the natural language program to account for the observed discrepancies, making the rules more general and robust. This may involve handling cases with no yellow, different object arrangements, and other unanticipated scenarios.
4.  **Metrics Collection**: use code to generate reports on pixels and objects in each example

**Metrics Collection and Example Analysis**

I'll use code execution to gather data on the input/output grids, and then compare each predicted output vs the actual.

**Refined Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Colored Objects:** Examine the input grid and identify all distinct colored objects. Consider each contiguous block of a single color as an object.
2. **Determine Output Column**:
    - if yellow is present, the output will be a column, with height determined by number of rows from the top most, to bottom most yellow objects, inclusively
    - the output will be a sub-section of the input column containing the yellow objects
    - copy any colors in the same column, skipping empty cells
3.  **Determine Output Row:** If *only* azure is present, the output is a single row, containing all of the azure segments from the input. The length of the row is determined by the combined length of the azure segments.
4.  **Object Placement:**
    -   Yellow objects, if present, establish the structure. Other colors are placed based on their relative position to the yellow "bookends", specifically their position in the same column.

**Summary of Changes from Previous Iteration**
The most important change is to copy a column section based on the positions of
yellow objects, rather than building rows based on yellow objects.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # change output pixels
