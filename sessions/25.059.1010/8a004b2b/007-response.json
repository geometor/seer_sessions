The input grid is larger than the output grid. The output grid seems to be a cropped and, in some areas, condensed version of the input grid. The colors present are white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4). The most striking feature is the consolidation of blue (1) squares.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If multiple blue squares are adjacent horizontally or vertically, condense or connect those. Horizontal blue blocks attempt to connect by filling a line between the blocks if all colors inbetween are white. Vertical condensation simply merges contiguous vertically aligned blocks. Diagonal and isolated squares do not get condensed.\n3. **Preserve other colors:** Other colored squares (red, green, yellow) are preserved from the cropped input to the output without modification to position or dimension, in the same absolute positions relative to each other.\n\n"
