There are contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color, which we can consider as \"objects.\"\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are smaller than the input grids, and seem to retain a compressed, combined, or simplified version of the objects and color arrangements from the input.\n*    The output grids also seem to omit or remove elements from the input that are not part of colored objects.\n*   **Colors:** The colors present are consistent with the ARC color map (0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 8: azure).\n* **Yellow frame:** The yellow pixels (4) in the corners seems to define a rectangular region of interest. The inside of that yellow border frame shrinks, and it seems like the output grid are the result of combining color regions inside the frame.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n"

The height and width of the output grid are the same as the dimensions of the \"inner region\" divided by 2, rounding down for odd dimensions (integer divison by 2, no remainders).\n4. **Merge regions** For each 2 x 2 region inside of the input yellow border, combine into the output grid, into a single cell in the output grid.\n5.  **Combine Colors:**\n    *    If the cells of the 2x2 region contains only 0 and a single other color, the non-zero color is used.\n    *    If a 2x2 region in input contains multiples different colors, the color that is in the bottom right most cell is the output.\n\n"
