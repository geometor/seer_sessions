Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grids:** The input grids are rectangular and contain various colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9). There are contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color, which we can consider as "objects."
*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are smaller than the input grids, and seem to retain a compressed, combined, or simplified version of the objects and color arrangements from the input.
*    The output grids also seem to omit or remove elements from the input that are not part of colored objects.
*   **Colors:** The colors present are consistent with the ARC color map (0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 8: azure).
* **Yellow frame:** The yellow pixels (4) in the corners seems to define a rectangular region of interest. The inside of that yellow border frame shrinks, and it seems like the output grid are the result of combining color regions inside the frame.

**YAML Fact Identification:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids contain colored objects (contiguous blocks of same-colored pixels).
  - observation: Output grids seem to represent a simplified or combined version of the objects in the input grid.
  - observation: There is a frame of "4" (yellow color) in the corner.
  - observation: the size of the output grid seems to be related with the frame defined by 4.
  - observation: Pixels with value 0 in the input seem to be largely ignored in the output, except for maintaining overall shape.
  - observation: Connected regions of non-zero pixels inside the yellow frame, are merged together in the output.
  - observation: Regions of adjacent and diagonally touching pixels inside the frame are maintained or combined.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Frame:** Locate the rectangular frame defined by the yellow (color 4) pixels in the corners of the input grid.
2.  **Inner Region:** Determine the dimensions of the inner rectangle enclosed by this yellow frame.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, smaller output grid. The height and width of the output grid are the same as the dimensions of the "inner region" divided by 2, rounding down for odd dimensions (integer divison by 2, no remainders).
4. **Merge regions** For each 2 x 2 region inside of the input yellow border, combine into the output grid, into a single cell in the output grid.
5.  **Combine Colors:**
    *    If the cells of the 2x2 region contains only 0 and a single other color, the non-zero color is used.
    *    If a 2x2 region in input contains multiples different colors, the color that is in the bottom right most cell is the output.



```
Example:

input:
0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

1. The frame is defined by 4 at (0,2), (0, 15), (8, 2), (8, 15)

2. There are no corner pixels. Inner region goes from row 1 to 7, and cols 3 to 14. Size is 7 height, 12 width

3. Output will be of size 3 x 6

4. loop for row in range(1, 7, 2): # start, stop, step (exclusive of last, jump of 2)
      loop for col in range(3, 15, 2):
         region_to_reduce = input_grid[row:row+2, col:col+2]

5. For each region, combine adjacent cells:
Example 1:
row=1, col=3
0 0
0 0  -> output cell become 0
Example 2:
row=1, col=5
3 3
3 3 -> output cell is 3
Example 3:
row = 3, col= 7
0 0
1 1 -> output is 1

```
