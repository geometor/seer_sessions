            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a reasonable hypothesis: extracting the smallest bounding box containing all non-white pixels. The results, however, reveal that this hypothesis is incomplete or incorrect for some of the training examples. The strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Failures:** Carefully examine the input/output pairs where the code failed. Identify the specific discrepancies between the expected output and the actual output.\n2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for common patterns or rules that explain the failures. Are there specific colors, shapes, or arrangements of pixels that the current logic doesn't handle?\n3. **Hypothesis Adjustment**: Update observations and facts, then refine/rewrite the natural language program\n\n**Gather Metrics and Example Analysis (using code_execution when necessary)**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each training example and the results, including analysis using a theoretical code_execution (since I can't actually execute code here)\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Predicted Output Shape | Result    | Analysis                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | (11, 11)    | (3, 5)      | (3, 5)                 | Success   | The initial hypothesis works perfectly here. The bounding box of non-white pixels is correctly extracted.                                                                                      |\n| 2       | (13, 13)    | (5, 5)       | (5,5)                 | Success  | The initial hypothesis works perfectly here.                                                                    |\n| 3       | (3, 3)    | (3, 3)       | (3, 3)                 | Success   | The initial hypothesis works perfectly here, all pixels are non-white.                                                                                                                        |\n| 4     |    (6,3)         |   (6,3)           |   (6,3)                       |  Success         |  The smallest non-white rectangle matches the input shape.                                       |\n| 5     |    (6,6)         |       (1, 1)       |     (4, 4)                     |  Fail         |  A single gray pixel is the output, original assumption does not capture the transformation accurately.                                      |\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      The initial hypothesis of extracting the smallest bounding box of non-white pixels works for some, but not all, of the training examples.\n  - input_grid_properties:\n      - shape: variable (between 1x1 and 30x30)\n      - cell_values: integers (0-9, representing colors)\n  - output_grid_properties:\n      - shape: variable\n      - cell_values: integers (0-9, representing colors)\n  - example_analysis:\n    - example_5:\n        - input contains a cross, output is a single gray pixel.\n  - transformation_type:\n    - conditional: |\n        The transformation rule appears to be dependent on the specific arrangement of the pixels.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Examine Input:** Take the input grid.\n2.  **Identify non-white pixels:** Locate all pixels that are not white (value 0).\n3.  **Bounding box**: If the non-white pixels form a shape, find the bounding box.\n4. **Conditional Rule**:\n      * if a \"cross\" shape is present, return the single pixel in the center of the cross\n      * Otherwise: Return a subgrid which contains the smallest rectangle containing all the non-white pixels.\n5. **Return Subgrid**: extract the defined grid.\n\nThe key update here is the addition of the conditional rule that captures the special \"cross\" case observed in the training example #5. This revised program attempts to address the shortcomings.\n"
