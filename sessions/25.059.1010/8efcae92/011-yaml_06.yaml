observations:

    objects:
      - name: input_grid
        description: The original grid of pixels.
        properties:
          - dimensions: variable (MxN)
          - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # All possible colors
      - name: bounding_box
        description: The smallest rectangular region within the input grid containing all non-white pixels.
        properties:
          - dimensions: variable (HxW)
          - location: relative to input_grid
      - name: non_white_pixels
        description: Pixels within the bounding box that are not white (color 0).
        properties:
          - colors: [1, 2]  # Observed to be only blue and red
          - positions: relative to the bounding box's top-left corner
      - name: output_grid
        description: The resulting grid after the transformation.
        properties:
          - dimensions: variable (PxQ)
          - colors: [1, 2] # Observed to be only blue and red

    actions:
      - name: extract_subgrid
        description: A subgrid is extracted based on the bounding box of non-white pixels.
      - name: remove_white_pixels
        description: All white pixels within the subgrid are removed.
      - name: reconstruct_grid
        description: >
          The non-white pixels are rearranged to form the output grid.  The
          relative positions of the non-white pixels within the bounding
          box are *critical* to this reconstruction. The arrangement and
          dimensions of the output are determined by the original relative positions
          of the non-white pixels. This is NOT a simple reshape.
