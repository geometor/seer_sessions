objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1, 2] # white, blue, red
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 20x20, 20x19)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [1, 2] # blue, red
      - dimensions: variable, smaller than input_grid

  - name: blue_region
    type: connected component
    properties:
     - color: 1

  - name: red_pixels
    type: individual pixels or small clusters
    properties:
      - color: 2

actions:
  - name: condense
    description: Reduces the grid size while preserving relative positions of red pixels.
  - name: remove_background
    description: Eliminates all white (0) pixels.
    
relationships:
  - input_grid contains multiple blue_regions and red_pixels.
  - output_grid represents a condensed version of the input_grid, maintaining the relative positions of red pixels within a blue field. The output field is a large connected component of blue pixels.
