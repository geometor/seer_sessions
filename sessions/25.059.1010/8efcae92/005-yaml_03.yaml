facts:
  - observation: |
      The initial hypothesis of extracting the smallest bounding box of non-white pixels works for some, but not all, of the training examples.
  - input_grid_properties:
      - shape: variable (between 1x1 and 30x30)
      - cell_values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - output_grid_properties:
      - shape: variable
      - cell_values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - example_analysis:
    - example_5:
        - input contains a cross, output is a single gray pixel.
  - transformation_type:
    - conditional: |
        The transformation rule appears to be dependent on the specific arrangement of the pixels.
