Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (20x20) containing mostly blue (1) and white (0) pixels, with some red (2) pixels interspersed. The output is a smaller grid (9x9) also containing blue (1) and red (2) pixels. The output seems to be a condensed, abstracted, or cropped version of the main features of the input, while maintaining the general relative locations of the red pixels within a field of blue pixels. The white pixels in the input are completely gone and do not appear in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - blue (1)
        - red (2)
      position: [row, column]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [height, width]
      content: 2D array of pixels

actions:
- type: extract_subgrid #inferring - may need refinement later
  input: source_grid
  parameters:
       focus_color: blue, red # inferred, eliminate white

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Red pixels are surrounded by blue pixels, blue by other blues, and red, white and blue, all within a larger grid. The output grid pixels relate to the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the bounding box:** Imagine to find a sub-grid, scaled/resized somehow, that the output grid is. Iterate to perform this.
2.  **Ignore White:** Completely discard any white pixels.
3. **Create new smaller grid**: The dimensions are much smaller. (9x9 vs 20x20)
4.  **Transfer Relevant Colors:** Copy only the red and blue pixels from the imagined input sub-grid to the output grid, maintaining their relative positions. The locations are not identical, but the relative arrangement of the red within blue is kept.

In simpler terms, extract a section of the input grid, remove the white pixels, and shrink/resize the result while keeping the red and blue pixels in roughly the same arrangement.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
