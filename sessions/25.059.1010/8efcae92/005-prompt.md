Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to extract the smallest rectangular region containing all non-white pixels from the input grid and return it as the output grid. This involves finding the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by non-white pixels, and then slicing the input grid to extract this region.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Convert input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Find the indices of all non-white (non-zero) pixels.
    non_white_indices = np.argwhere(input_array != 0)

    # If there are no non-white pixels, return an empty grid (or handle as appropriate).
    if non_white_indices.size == 0:
        return np.array([])  # Or perhaps a 1x1 grid with a default value

    # Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices.
    min_row, min_col = np.min(non_white_indices, axis=0)
    max_row, max_col = np.max(non_white_indices, axis=0)

    # Extract the subgrid defined by these boundaries.
    output_grid = input_array[min_row:max_row+1, min_col:max_col+1]

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
