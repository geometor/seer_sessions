Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing pixels of different colors, primarily blue (1), red (2), and background white (0). The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids and seem to contain a condensed or summarized representation of the input, retaining the relative positions of the red (2) pixels within a field of blue (1) pixels. The white (0) background is completely eliminated. The core operation seems to involve identifying connected components of blue and red, and recreating a smaller version of the input where only connected blue and the red pixels are maintained.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1, 2] # white, blue, red
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 20x20, 20x19)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [1, 2] # blue, red
      - dimensions: variable, smaller than input_grid

  - name: blue_region
    type: connected component
    properties:
     - color: 1

  - name: red_pixels
    type: individual pixels or small clusters
    properties:
      - color: 2

actions:
  - name: condense
    description: Reduces the grid size while preserving relative positions of red pixels.
  - name: remove_background
    description: Eliminates all white (0) pixels.
    
relationships:
  - input_grid contains multiple blue_regions and red_pixels.
  - output_grid represents a condensed version of the input_grid, maintaining the relative positions of red pixels within a blue field. The output field is a large connected component of blue pixels.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Background:** The background color is white (0).
2. **Remove Background:** Eliminate all white pixels from the input grid.
3. **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all red (2) pixels within the remaining grid.
4. **Identify the largest blue connected component:** Find the connected components of the blue (1) color, select the largest as the field.
5. **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the minimum size. Initialize this grid to the largest blue region from the input.
6. **Place Red Pixels:** Copy red (2) color from the filtered input (without white background) to the new grid respecting coordinates.
7.  **Result:** output grid

Essentially, the transformation extracts and shrinks the parts of the input grid that are not the white background, keeping the spatial relationships between blue (1) and red (2) colored pixels. The process condenses and filters to produce the output, and there is a clear focus on the blue and red sub-regions.
