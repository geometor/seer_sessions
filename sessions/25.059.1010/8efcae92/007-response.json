            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a reasonable hypothesis, focusing on identifying a \"cross\" shape and extracting a bounding box otherwise. The tests reveal that this hypothesis is not entirely correct, the program seems too focused on extracting a subgrid and doesn't handle some cases such as only wanting a single output pixel.\n\nMy strategy is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, along with the code's output, to pinpoint exactly where the logic breaks down. I'll create a table for organized tracking.\n2.  **Identify Incorrect Assumptions:** Determine which parts of the initial natural language program are incorrect or incomplete.\n3. **Metric Gathering:** use code execution to get shape, unique colors and other\n   useful metrics\n4.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation rule, taking into account all the training examples.\n5. **Prepare YAML facts:** I will produce the YAML facts for this task\n\n**Example Analysis and Metric Gathering**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each training example, including the expected output, the actual output from the code, assessment and metrics:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Expected Output                                                                                           | Actual Output                                                                                                | Assessment                                                                                                 | Metrics (Input)                                                                                                         | Metrics (Output)                                                                                                 |\n| ------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 1       | (11, 11)    | (1, 1)      | Single blue pixel.                                       | Single blue pixel.                                              | Correct.

A cross shape is defined as a 3x3 grid where the center row and center column are all the same non-white color, all other values are white, and the center value of the 3x3 grid is also this color.\n4.  **Conditional Extraction:**\n    *   If a cross shape is present, return a 1x1 grid containing *only* the center pixel of the cross.\n    *   If no cross shape is present, and there is only one non-white pixel, return the single non-white pixel as a 1x1 grid.\n    *   If no non-white pixels are present, return an empty grid.\n    * If a cross is not present, but other non-cross shapes are present, return just the center of the cross if it was a cross\n\nThe key change is combining the handling of the cross shape with the default case. The bounding box idea is not necessary here. The task seems to want the *center pixel of a cross shape*, or any *single* non-white pixel if no cross is present.\n"
