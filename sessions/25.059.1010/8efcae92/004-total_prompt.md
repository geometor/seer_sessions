Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger, more complex grid (input) into a smaller, simplified grid (output). The input grid appears to contain two distinct rectangular shapes composed of blue (1) and red (2) pixels, surrounded by white (0) pixels.  The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of only the colored parts of the input, specifically retaining the arrangement of blue and red pixels, but removing any white space and contracting the shape. The output shape appears to maintain the 2D structure, and all the colors, present in the sub region of the input grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid contains two distinct rectangular regions of blue (1) and red (2) pixels.
  - observation: The rest of input consists of white (0) pixels.
  - observation: Output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid.
  - observation: Output grid contains only blue (1) and red (2) pixels.
  - observation: The relative positions of the blue and red pixels are preserved.
  - property: input_grid_size: 20x20
  - property: output_grid_size: 6x5
  - relationship: Output grid appears to be a cropped and condensed version of the colored regions within the input grid.
  - action: cropping: Removing white space
  - action: condensing: Combining separated colored areas.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Regions:** Locate all non-white (non-zero) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Isolate:** Consider the smallest bounding box on the input grid which can contain all of the non-white pixels.
3. **Crop:** remove rows and columns of all white pixels from the edges of the input.
4.  **Output:** Produce the resulting grid. The colors, and 2D structure of non-white colors are preserved in this smallest possible output grid.

In essence, the transformation isolates and extracts the core colored structure from the input grid, eliminating all surrounding white space, while preserving the 2D positioning of the colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
