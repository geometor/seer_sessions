Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing integer values representing colors. The input grid is significantly larger than the output grid.  The primary colors involved seem to be blue (1) and red (2), with some white (0) in the input. The transformation appears to involve a significant reduction in size, and perhaps a focus on the arrangement of red (2) pixels within a predominantly blue (1) background. The output grid's dimensions seem unrelated to the input by any trivial proportion.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [variable, variable] # Height and width can vary
      cells:
        type: integer
        values: [0, 1, 2] # white, blue, red

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        type: integer
        values: [0, 1, 2]
      position:
        type: coordinate
        values: [row, col]

actions:
  - name: resize
    properties:
      input_grid_to_output_grid: unknown

  - name: color_filtering_and_retaining:
      description: "The input grid is mostly blue with some red pixels. Output has the same colors but is much smaller"
      parameters:
        - color_to_retain: [1, 2]

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The relative positions of red pixels within the blue background in the input seem to be, in some way, reflected in the output, but the transformation method is not directly obvious.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Region of Interest:** Examine the input grid and focus on the area containing blue (1) and red (2) pixels, disregarding the surrounding white (0) pixels. Note that this does not mean the white pixels can simply be trimmed.

2.  **Reduce Size:** Drastically reduce the size of the identified region to a much smaller grid. The new dimensions are not immediately obvious, but seem significantly condensed.

3.  **Preserve Relative Red Positions:** While reducing the size, maintain the approximate relative positions of the red (2) pixels within the predominantly blue (1) background. The exact mapping of positions is not a direct scaling or simple sub-sampling, but rather a more complex transformation that preserves some spatial relationships.

4.  **Output:** Output the reduced grid with blue and red pixels, capturing the essential red pixel arrangement.

In summary, the transformation extracts a "core" from the input grid, preserving relative red positions. It shrinks a region, not just the overall grid. The white portions do not seem to directly influence the output. The key challenge is figuring out *how* exactly this reduction and preservation of red positioning occurs.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
