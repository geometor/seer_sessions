The output is a smaller grid (9x9) also containing blue (1) and red (2) pixels. The output seems to be a condensed, abstracted, or cropped version of the main features of the input, while maintaining the general relative locations of the red pixels within a field of blue pixels. The white pixels in the input are completely gone and do not appear in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Iterate to perform this.\n2.  **Ignore White:** Completely discard any white pixels.\n3. **Create new smaller grid**: The dimensions are much smaller. (9x9 vs 20x20)\n4.  **Transfer Relevant Colors:** Copy only the red and blue pixels from the imagined input sub-grid to the output grid, maintaining their relative positions. The locations are not identical, but the relative arrangement of the red within blue is kept.\n\nIn simpler terms, extract a section of the input grid, remove the white pixels, and shrink/resize the result while keeping the red and blue pixels in roughly the same arrangement.\n"
