facts:
  - observation: Input grid contains two distinct rectangular regions of blue (1) and red (2) pixels.
  - observation: The rest of input consists of white (0) pixels.
  - observation: Output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid.
  - observation: Output grid contains only blue (1) and red (2) pixels.
  - observation: The relative positions of the blue and red pixels are preserved.
  - property: input_grid_size: 20x20
  - property: output_grid_size: 6x5
  - relationship: Output grid appears to be a cropped and condensed version of the colored regions within the input grid.
  - action: cropping: Removing white space
  - action: condensing: Combining separated colored areas.
