Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Input Grid**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: 8
    shape: L-shape
    positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
  - color: 8
    shape: L-shape
    positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct objects. Both are L-shaped and composed of the color 8 (azure).

2.  **Predicate Changes**: The top leftmost and bottom rightmost pixels in the L-shapes change its color.

3. **Describe action**: The transformation rule is: For each L-shape comprised of color 8, change the top leftmost pixel's color from 8 to 1, and change the bottom rightmost pixel's color from 8 to 1.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
