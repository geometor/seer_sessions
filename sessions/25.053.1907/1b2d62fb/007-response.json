The input grid appears to have a vertical line of blue (1) pixels and surrounding maroon (9) and white (0) pixels. The output grid seems to be a cropped and color-modified version of the input, retaining only a portion related to the blue (1) pixels and changing some to azure (8). The dimensions also change, going from 7x5 to 3x5.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The cropped section consists of three columns: The column to the left of the blue line and the two columns to the right. The height of the cropped section should be the height of the original section.\n3.  **Change Colors**: Transform the pixels that were blue (1) to be azure(8). Leave all other pixel in the cropped section as color 0.\n\n"
