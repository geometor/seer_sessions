There's a prominent vertical line of '1's (blue) in the center. The surrounding pixels are a mix of '0' (white), and '9' (maroon).\n*   **Output:** A smaller 2D grid, also of single-digit integers. It seems to be a drastically simplified version of the input. It contains only '0' (white) and '8' (azure). The '8's (azure) are in the same relative position, but many pixels have been removed.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The height is the same as the number of rows of 1s in the input grid. The width appears to be fixed to 3 columns centered on the original line.\n3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the subgrid defined by the bounds in the previous step.\n4.  **Replace Values:**\n    *   Replace all '1' values within the subgrid with '8' (azure).\n    *   Replace all other values in the subgrid with '0' (white).\n5.   Return extracted and transformed subgrid.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts a region around, and including, the central blue line, replaces the blue with azure, and sets all other colors to white. The final result is a condensed, and recolored section of the central feature of the input image.\n"
