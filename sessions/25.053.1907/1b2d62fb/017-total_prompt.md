Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Find Center:** Locate the central vertical column of the input grid (index = width // 2).
2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract a 3-column-wide subgrid centered on the identified central column. This means taking the central column itself, one column to its left, and one column to its right, while keeping all rows.
3.  **Conditional Recolor:** For each row in the subgrid, if the output pixel is different from the input pixel, then it is replaced by the value of the other non-center pixel. If there is a change to a pixel in the left or right of the extracted subgrid, change to the color of the opposite side.
4.  **Output:** The resulting 3xN subgrid (where N is the number of rows) is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
