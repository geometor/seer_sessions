Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are blue (color code 1).
2.  **Determine Cropping Region:**
    *   Find the leftmost column containing any blue pixel.
    *   The cropped region starts one column to the left of this leftmost blue pixel's column.
    *   The cropped region extends three columns wide.
    *   The cropped region's height is the same as the input grid's height.
3.  **Crop:** Extract the defined cropped region from the input grid.
4.  **Transform Colors:**
    *   Within the cropped region, change all blue pixels (color code 1) to azure (color code 8).
    * Set all the other pixels in the cropped region to black (color code 0)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
