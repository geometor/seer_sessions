The input grid seems to have a prominent vertical stripe of '1' (blue) and various arrangements of '9' (maroon) and '0' (white). The output grid is smaller and seems to focus on a specific area of the input, replacing some '0's (white) with '8's (azure) based on a relation with the blue stripe in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

If the sub-grid pixel is not '0', it becomes '0'.\n5.  **Output:** The transformed region is presented as the output grid.\n\nEssentially, the transformation isolates a region of the input grid defined by a blue vertical stripe then modifies the values of the sub-grid to the right of this region.\n"
