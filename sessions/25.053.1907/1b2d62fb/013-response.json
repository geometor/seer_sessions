These represent colors: white, blue, and maroon, respectively.  The most prominent feature is a vertical blue stripe (1's) in the center. There are patterns of maroon (9) and white (0) around this central stripe.\n*   **Output Grid:** A 5x3 grid, smaller than the input. It contains digits 0 and 8, representing white and azure. The output seems to be a simplified or abstracted version of the input, focusing on the central area, where there was a blue stripe in input. The azure (8) pixels in the output correspond to the blue areas of the central stripe.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this case, it's the column at index 3 (the fourth column).\n2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract a 5x3 subgrid centered on the identified column. This means take the central column, and one column to the left and one column to the right, preserving all rows.\n3.  **Recolor:** In the extracted subgrid, change all pixels in the center column that have a value of 1 (blue) to 8 (azure). Keep the values of all other surrounding columns the same.\n4.  **Output:** The resulting 5x3 subgrid is the output.\n\nIn summary, the transformation extracts a 3-column-wide section from the center of the input grid and changes blue(1) in the center column of this extracted part to azure(8).\n"
