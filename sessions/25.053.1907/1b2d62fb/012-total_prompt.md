Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, analysis of the results, and an updated natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial strategy was on the right track – identifying blue pixels and using them to define a cropping region. However, the transformation logic within the cropped region is incorrect. The current code *always* changes the middle column of the *cropped* grid to azure, regardless of the original positions of the blue pixels in the *input* grid. The code needs to more accurately track the locations of the blue pixels, and make the changes only if the blue pixels in the input grid map to the position in the output grid.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Correct Blue Pixel Mapping:** The core issue is that the code isn't correctly translating the positions of blue pixels from the input grid to the cropped grid. The `original_col` calculation is a step in the right direction, but needs to be complete.

2.  **Revisit Cropping Logic:** Although it's based on the leftmost blue, there might be a subtle relationship that is making the crop consistent across all of the tasks. We should verify.

3. **Color Transformation Improvement** improve the logic for replacing color with azure based on the initial location of the blue pixels

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, incorporating some checks:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has blue pixels at (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3).
    *   Leftmost blue column: 3.
    *   Cropped region: Columns 2-4 (inclusive).
    *   Expected output shows azure at (3,1), (3,2) within the cropped region,
        which aligns with input at (3,3) and (3,4)
    *   Current code makes all of column index 1 of output azure

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has blue pixels at (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3).
    *   Leftmost blue column: 3.
    *   Cropped region: Columns 2-4 (inclusive).
    *   Expected output shows azure at (0,1) of cropped, which corresponds to
        (0,3) of input
    *   Current code makes all of column index 1 of output azure

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input has blue pixels at (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)
    *   Leftmost blue column: 3
    *   Cropping Region: Columns 2-4
    *   Expected Output shows a complex pattern where blue pixels in the input
        do not always result in azure

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input has blue pixels at (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)
    *   Leftmost blue column: 3
    *   Cropping Region: Columns 2-4
    *   Expected Output shows a complex pattern where blue pixels in the input
        do not always result in azure

*    **Example 5:**
    *   Input has blue pixels at (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)
    *   Leftmost blue column: 3
    *   Cropping Region: Columns 2-4
    *   Expected Output shows that there is no azure where blue pixels are
        located at (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), and (4,3)

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - blue_pixels: []

  - name: cropped_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: 3
      - height: same as input_grid
      - start_column: one to the left of the leftmost blue pixel in input_grid

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid

actions:
  - name: crop
    input: input_grid
    output: cropped_grid
    description: Crop the input grid based on blue pixel positions.

  - name: transform_color
    input: [cropped_grid, input_grid]
    output: output_grid
    description: >-
      Selectively change the color of pixels within the cropped region based on input blue pixels
      Specifically set the color of pixels to azure for specific input blue pixels.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Blue Pixels:** Identify all pixels in the *input* grid that are blue (color code 1).

2.  **Determine Cropping Region:**
    *   Find the leftmost column index containing a blue pixel.
    *   The cropped region starts one column to the *left* of this leftmost blue pixel's column. If the leftmost blue pixel is in the first column, start cropping at column 0.
    *   The cropped region is always 3 columns wide.
    *   The cropped region has the same height as the input grid.

3.  **Crop:** Extract the specified cropped region from the input grid.

4.  **Conditional Color Transformation:**

    * Initialize the `output_grid` as all black
    * Iterate over the `cropped_grid`
    * For each pixel in the `cropped_grid`:
        * calculate the original index of the pixel from `input_grid`
        * if the pixel location corresponds with one of the locations
          of a blue pixel in the input grid AND certain conditions are met, change the color to
          azure (8).
        * The condition: within the cropped region, blue pixels change to azure conditionally, not always, based on their original location and surrounding. The pattern from observation is more complex than simple one-to-one. It could
          be a combination, a diagonal, etc.

5. Return the transformed `output_grid`

The critical change is in step 4. It acknowledges the *conditional* nature of the blue-to-azure transformation, which the previous code and natural language program did not consider. This complexity of the conditions on when a blue pixel turns azure will require further refinement in the next iteration, when we rewrite the function.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
