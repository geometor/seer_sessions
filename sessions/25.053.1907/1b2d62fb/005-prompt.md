Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the longest vertical line of blue (1) pixels** in the input grid. Record its starting row, column index, and length.
2.  **Determine Output Grid Height:** The output grid has the same height as the length of the identified blue line.
3.  **Determine the Region and Output Grid Width:**
    - initialize the output grid width as 1.
    - iterate through each row within the length of the blue vertical line.
    - For each row:
        - If the pixel to the *left* of the blue pixel is 0, then add a column to the beginning of the output grid.
        - If the pixel to the *right* of the blue pixel is 0, then add a column to the end of the output grid.
4.  **Create and Populate output grid:** Create the correctly sized and shaped output grid filled with white (0).
    - Iterate through each row within the length of the blue vertical line.
    - For each row:
        - populate the central pixel with azure (8)
        - If the pixel to the *left* of the blue pixel is 0, populate the left pixel with azure (8)
        - If the pixel to the *right* of the blue pixel is 0, populate the right pixel with azure (8).
5.  **Return** the resulting output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
