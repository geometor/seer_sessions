# Example

**input:**
```
0 9 9 1 9 9 9
0 0 9 1 9 9 0
9 0 9 1 9 9 0
0 0 0 1 9 0 0
0 9 9 1 9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7EF8F235FA00>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 8 8
0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 2D grid (matrix) of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. There's a prominent vertical line of '1's (blue) in the center. The surrounding pixels are a mix of '0' (white), and '9' (maroon).
*   **Output:** A smaller 2D grid, also of single-digit integers. It seems to be a drastically simplified version of the input. It contains only '0' (white) and '8' (azure). The '8's (azure) are in the same relative position, but many pixels have been removed.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    shape: rectangular
    properties:
      - has_central_line: True
        value: 1
        orientation: vertical
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    shape: rectangular
    properties:
        - smaller_than: input_grid
  - action: extract_subgrid
    description: A smaller grid is extracted from the input grid.
  - action: replace_value
    description: specific values in the subgrid are maintained or changed, the rest are set to 0
    details:
      - original_value: 1
        new_value: 8
      - original_value: all others
        new_value: 0
  - relationship: spatial_correspondence
    description: The position of the '8' values in the output grid corresponds to a scaled-down section of the original positions of '1' in the input grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Region of Interest:** Locate the vertical line of '1's (blue pixels) in the input grid.
2.  **Define Subgrid:** Define bounds of the output grid. The height is the same as the number of rows of 1s in the input grid. The width appears to be fixed to 3 columns centered on the original line.
3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the subgrid defined by the bounds in the previous step.
4.  **Replace Values:**
    *   Replace all '1' values within the subgrid with '8' (azure).
    *   Replace all other values in the subgrid with '0' (white).
5.   Return extracted and transformed subgrid.

In essence, the transformation extracts a region around, and including, the central blue line, replaces the blue with azure, and sets all other colors to white. The final result is a condensed, and recolored section of the central feature of the input image.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
