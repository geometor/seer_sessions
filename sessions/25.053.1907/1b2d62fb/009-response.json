            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and generated code were on the right track, focusing on a vertical blue line and cropping around it. However, the code has two primary issues:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Color Placement After Cropping:** The code sets *all* positions where blue was found to azure, it always puts azure in the center column, rather than maintaining their original column position relative to the blue line within the cropped section.\n2.  **Incorrect Assumption of Single Vertical Line:** The code assumes there will be a single complete vertical line. The examples show that the blue pixels might not form a perfect, uninterrupted vertical line, and it may be interrupted or staggered. It should handle cases where blue pixels are adjacent vertically but don't form complete lines.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Color Handling:** Instead of blindly setting azure in a fixed column, the code needs to identify *all* blue pixels within the cropped region and change *only those* to azure, preserving their original positions within the cropped grid.\n2.  **Handle Discontinuous Lines:** Instead of looking for a *complete* vertical line, we must identify all pixels that are blue (color 1) and perform the transformation on all of these pixels.\n3.  **Re-evaluate Cropping Logic:** Review the cropping logic carefully. The current \"-1/+2\" logic seems intended, but the inconsistent results suggest a subtle flaw or edge case that needs addressing in relation to where the blue pixels actually fall. The description of the crop might need to be changed.\n\n**Example Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating some additional observations:\n\n| Example | Input Size | Blue Line(s)? | Blue Pixels | Cropped Size | Expected Colors           | Transformed Colors                                         | Errors/Notes                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| :------ | :--------- | :------------ | :---------- | :----------- | :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | 5x7        | Yes           | (0,3),(1,3),  (2,3),(3,3),  (4,3)           | 5x3         | 5 azure, 10 black     | 5 azure, 10 black, (all azure in col 1 of cropped region)  | Azure in wrong column after cropping.                                                                                                         |\n| 2       | 5x7        | Yes           | (0,3),(1,3),  (2,3),(3,3),  (4,3)         | 5x3         | 1 azure, 14 black    | 5 azure, 10 black, (all azure in col 1 of cropped region) | Azure in wrong column.
