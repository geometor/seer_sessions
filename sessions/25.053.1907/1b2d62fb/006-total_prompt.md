Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the longest vertical line of blue (1) pixels** in the input grid. Record its starting row, column index, and length.
2.  **Determine Output Grid Height:** The output grid has the same height as the length of the identified blue line.
3.  **Determine the Region and Output Grid Width:**
    - initialize the output grid width as 1.
    - iterate through each row within the length of the blue vertical line.
    - For each row:
        - If the pixel to the *left* of the blue pixel is 0, then add a column to the beginning of the output grid.
        - If the pixel to the *right* of the blue pixel is 0, then add a column to the end of the output grid.
4.  **Create and Populate output grid:** Create the correctly sized and shaped output grid filled with white (0).
    - Iterate through each row within the length of the blue vertical line.
    - For each row:
        - populate the central pixel with azure (8)
        - If the pixel to the *left* of the blue pixel is 0, populate the left pixel with azure (8)
        - If the pixel to the *right* of the blue pixel is 0, populate the right pixel with azure (8).
5.  **Return** the resulting output grid.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the results, and the updated natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code focused on identifying the longest vertical blue line and using its adjacent white pixels to determine the output grid's width and the placement of azure pixels. However, the results show consistent errors across multiple examples. The core issue isn't just the placement of the azure pixels, but also the dimensions of the output grid and how they relate to the *entire context* of the blue line, not only to its length. We seem to check only the existence of a white pixel (0) to the left or right of the blue, and use it to determine output width, but we are doing it incorrectly. We also are filling the output grid incorrectly. The height and width aren't consistently correct, and neither is the fill. It seems that it is the *existence* of at least one white (0) to the left *or* right of the blue (1) that is key.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-evaluate Width Determination:** The current width calculation is flawed.  We need to determine a rule that applies across *all* examples.
2.  **Re-evaluate Height Determination:** The height calculation is also flawed. It should not always equal the line length.
3.  **Correct Azure Placement:** While the initial idea of using adjacent pixels for azure placement was partially correct, the implementation needs revision to account for cases where a white pixel may exist to the left or right.
4. **Refine conditions** verify each assumption against all available examples.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a summary of the results, including some added observations that could be helpful:

| Example | Input Shape | Expected Output Shape | Actual Output Shape | Match | Notes                                                                                                                  | Left White | Right White |

| 3       | (6, 7)      | (5, 3)                | (5, 3)              | False | Incorrect azure placement, although the shape is correct                                                             |    Yes     |     Yes     |
| 4       | (5, 7)      | (5, 3)                | (5, 3)              | False | Incorrect azure placement, although the shape is correct                                                             |    Yes     |     Yes     |
| 5       | (5, 7)      | (5, 3)                | (5, 3)              | False | Incorrect azure placement, although the shape is correct                                                             |    Yes     |     Yes     |

**Key Observations after re-examining the examples**
*   **Width:** The width is always 3 if there are *any* white (0) pixels to the *left or right* of the blue vertical line. Otherwise the width is 1.
*    **Height:** The height equals the number of rows in the blue line.
*   **Azure Placement:** The Azure (8) placement is not solely determined by directly adjacent white pixels *in each row*, but by the overall presence of white to the left or the right for the *entire blue line*. If there are white pixels on *either* side, the output is 3 wide, with an azure line down the middle, and azure pixels on the other columns in rows corresponding to white pixels next to blue in the same row. If there are no white pixels, it's a single azure column.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_line
    color: blue (1)
    shape: vertical line
    properties:
      length: varies
      start_row: varies
      column: varies
  - name: white_pixels
    color: white (0)
    shape: individual pixels
    properties:
      adjacency: adjacent to blue_line, either left or right

actions:
  - name: determine_output_dimensions
    input: blue_line, white_pixels
    description: Determine height and width of output grid based on blue line and presence of adjacent white pixels.
  - name: populate_output_grid
    input: output_dimensions, blue_line, white_pixels
    description: Fill the output grid with azure (8) pixels based on position of blue_line and the presence of white pixels on either side, in corresponding rows

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find the Longest Blue Line:** Identify the longest vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. Note its starting row, column index, and length.
2.  **Check for Adjacent Whites:** Determine if there are *any* white (0) pixels directly to the left *or* right of the *entire* blue line (not just row by row, but for the column as a whole).
3.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**
    *   **Height:** The output grid height is equal to the length of the longest blue line.
    *   **Width:**
        *   If there are *any* white pixels to the left *or* right of the blue line, the output width is 3.
        *   If there are *no* white pixels to the left *or* right of the blue line, the output width is 1.
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid filled with black (0) pixels, with the determined height and width.
5.  **Populate with Azure:**
    *    A vertical line of Azure (8) will always exist in the center of the output grid, for all rows, with a height equal to the length of the blue line.
    *   Iterate through each row of the *input grid* that corresponds to the blue line:
      * If, in a given row, there's a white pixel to the immediate left of the blue pixel *in the input*, place an azure pixel in the first column of the corresponding row in the *output* grid.
      * If, in a given row, there's a white pixel to the immediate right of the blue pixel *in the input*, place an azure pixel in the third column of the corresponding row in the *output* grid.
6.  **Return:** Return the resulting output grid.

This revised natural language program provides a more accurate and comprehensive description of the transformation, addressing the issues observed in the initial attempts. It emphasizes the crucial role of the *overall presence* of white pixels adjacent to the blue line, not just row-specific adjacency, for determining both the dimensions and the azure pixel placement within the output. It clarifies the conditional logic for placing azure and ensures all examples are taken into account.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
