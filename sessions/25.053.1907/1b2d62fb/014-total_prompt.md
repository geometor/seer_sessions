# Example

**input:**
```
9 0 0 1 9 0 9
9 0 0 1 0 9 0
9 0 0 1 9 0 0
0 9 9 1 0 9 9
0 0 9 1 0 9 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7EF8F177AB00>

**output:**
```
0 8 0
0 0 8
0 8 8
8 0 0
8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x7EF8F177B400>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 5x7 grid containing digits 0, 1, and 9. These represent colors: white, blue, and maroon, respectively.  The most prominent feature is a vertical blue stripe (1's) in the center. There are patterns of maroon (9) and white (0) around this central stripe.
*   **Output Grid:** A 5x3 grid, smaller than the input. It contains digits 0 and 8, representing white and azure. The output seems to be a simplified or abstracted version of the input, focusing on the central area, where there was a blue stripe in input. The azure (8) pixels in the output correspond to the blue areas of the central stripe.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 5x7
    elements: [0, 1, 9]
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 5x3
    elements: [0, 8]
  - type: column
    name: central_column
    color: blue (1)
    position: input_grid column 4
  - type: column
    name: output_column
    color: azure(8)

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: Extract a subgrid from the input grid.
  - type: replacement
    description: Replace the central column of blue(1) with azure(8).
  - type: remove
    description: remove the surronding columns of the extracted subgrid.

relationships:
  - relationship: "central_column in input_grid corresponds to output_column in output_grid"
  - relationship: "output_grid is a subset of the input_grid, focused around the central_column"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Center:** Identify the central vertical column in the input grid. In this case, it's the column at index 3 (the fourth column).
2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract a 5x3 subgrid centered on the identified column. This means take the central column, and one column to the left and one column to the right, preserving all rows.
3.  **Recolor:** In the extracted subgrid, change all pixels in the center column that have a value of 1 (blue) to 8 (azure). Keep the values of all other surrounding columns the same.
4.  **Output:** The resulting 5x3 subgrid is the output.

In summary, the transformation extracts a 3-column-wide section from the center of the input grid and changes blue(1) in the center column of this extracted part to azure(8).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
