            "text": "Here's an analysis of the results and a revised natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy correctly identified the importance of the vertical line of blue ('1') pixels. However, it incorrectly assumed that *only* the blue pixels in that line would be transformed to azure ('8'). The expected outputs reveal a more complex pattern of interaction with the surrounding context: the columns immediately to the left and right of the blue line *are* sometimes included, and those pixels should turn azure as well. It also always includes the adjacent pixels, and it should not. The current code's subgrid extraction is too simple, only extracting the three columns centered on the blue line, and only replacing the blue pixels within that subgrid.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Subgrid Extraction:** Instead of always extracting a 3-wide subgrid, we need to conditionally extract sections.\n2.  **Conditional Transformation:** The transformation to '8' (azure) must depend on original value of the pixel *and* position relative to the vertical line. The new code needs to consider the pixel values to the left and right in determining to add to the region, and to change to an 8.\n3.   **Dynamic Width**: The width of the output is dependent on the adjacent pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (via code execution):**\n\nIt's difficult to provide exact code to automatically evaluate \"correctness\" beyond simple pixel comparisons at this point, because the underlying logic is not yet captured. We can, however, systematically analyze the examples. Manually evaluating the outputs gives more insights at this stage.\n\nHere's a summary based on manual inspection, incorporating the provided transformed outputs:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Blue Line Col | Blue Line Len | Pixels Off | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :----------- | :----------- | :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | (5, 7)      | (5, 3)       | 3            | 5            | 5           | The output replaces *only* the blue line with azure, but should sometimes affect adjacent columns. Should have `0 8 0`, `0 8 0`, `0 8 0`, `0 8 0`, `0 8 0`.                                                |\n| 2       | (5, 7)      | (5, 3)       | 3            | 5            | 5           | Same issue as example 1. Should have `0 8 0`, `0 8 0`, `0 8 0`, `0 8 0`, `0 8 0`.                                                                             |\n| 3       | (5, 7)      | (5, 3)       | 3            | 5            | 7           |  The pattern is more nuanced.
