            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and the subsequent code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a very limited observation (only the first training example). It implemented a simple color mapping, but this mapping is clearly incomplete and incorrect, as evidenced by the failures in examples 2, 3, and 4. The strategy for resolving the errors is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine *all* input/output pairs to determine the *complete* color mapping rule.\n2.  **Identify incorrect mappings:** Pinpoint the specific color transformations that the current code is handling incorrectly.\n3.  **Revise the natural language program:** Update the description to reflect the full and correct mapping.\n4.  **Update Code (for next phase):** Modify the python code to implement the corrected mapping.\n5. Re-validate the result\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of each example, including a clearer report on where the code succeeded and failed.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input:  `3 1 2` (repeated 3x)\n    *   Expected Output: `4 5 6` (repeated 3x)\n    *   Transformed Output: `4 5 6` (repeated 3x)\n    *   Result: **Correct**. The initial mapping happened to be correct for these specific colors.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input:  `2 3 8` (repeated 3x)\n    *   Expected Output: `6 4 9` (repeated 3x)\n    *   Transformed Output: `6 4 8` (repeated 3x)\n    *   Result: **Incorrect**.\n        *   `2 -> 6`: Correct.\n        *   `3 -> 4`: Correct.\n        *   `8 -> 9`: **Incorrect**. The code leaves 8 unchanged.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `5 8 6` (repeated 3x)\n    *   Expected Output: `1 9 2` (repeated 3x)\n    *   Transformed Output: `5 8 6` (repeated 3x)\n    *   Result: **Incorrect**.\n        *   `5 -> 1`: **Incorrect**. The code leaves 5 unchanged.\n        *   `8 -> 9`: **Incorrect**. The code leaves 8 unchanged.\n        *   `6 -> 2`: **Incorrect**. The code leaves 6 unchanged.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: `9 4 2` (repeated 3x)\n    *   Expected Output: `8 3 6` (repeated 3x)\n    *   Transformed Output: `9 4 6` (repeated 3x)\n    *   Result: **Incorrect**.\n        *   `9 -> 8`: **Incorrect**. The code leaves 9 unchanged.\n        *   `4 -> 3`: **Incorrect**. The code leaves 4 unchanged.\n        *   `2 -> 6`: Correct.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example: 1\n    input_colors: [3, 1, 2]\n    output_colors: [4, 5, 6]\n    mapping:\n      3: 4\n      1: 5\n      2: 6\n    result: correct\n  - example: 2\n    input_colors: [2, 3, 8]\n    output_colors: [6, 4, 9]\n    mapping:\n      2: 6\n      3: 4\n      8: 9\n    result: partially correct\n  - example: 3\n    input_colors: [5, 8, 6]\n    output_colors: [1, 9, 2]\n    mapping:\n      5: 1\n      8: 9\n      6: 2\n    result: incorrect\n  - example: 4\n    input_colors: [9, 4, 2]\n    output_colors: [8, 3, 6]\n    mapping:\n      9: 8\n      4: 3\n      2: 6\n    result: partially correct\n  - summary: |\n      The transformation is a one-to-one color mapping. Each color in\n      the input grid is replaced by a different, specific color in\n      the output grid. The mapping observed so far and that needs\n      to hold in the general case:\n          1 -> 5\n          2 -> 6\n          3 -> 4\n          4 -> 3\n          5 -> 1\n          6 -> 2\n          8 -> 9\n          9 -> 8\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule is a one-to-one color mapping. Every pixel in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding, predefined color in the output grid. The specific color mapping is as follows:\n\n*   Blue (1) becomes Gray (5)\n*   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6)\n*   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4)\n*   Yellow (4) becomes Green (3)\n*   Gray (5) becomes Blue (1)\n*   Magenta (6) becomes Red (2)\n*   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9)\n*   Maroon (9) becomes Azure (8)\n*   White (0) and Orange (7) remain unchanged.\n\nThis program provides a *complete* description based on all available training data. It corrects the deficiencies of the previous description, which was based only on the first example.\n"
