# Example

**input:**
```
0 4 0 9
0 0 0 0
0 4 6 0
1 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7EF8F235FB50>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 4 0 0
1 4 6 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7EF8F235FA00>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 4x4 grids. The input grid contains single-digit integers (0-9) representing different colors. The output grid appears to be a rearrangement of some of the elements from the input grid. Some elements are removed, and positions are changed. The consistent elements are those with values 1, 4, 6, and 9. The zeros are also present in both but their relative positions are changed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Input and output grids containing colored pixels.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: Represented by integers 0-9.
      position: (row, column) within the grid.
    description: Individual cells within the grids.

actions:
  - type: rearrangement
    description: Moving pixels to different positions within the grid.
  - type: removal
    description: Eliminating pixels from the input grid.
  - type: preservation
    description: Retaining the same position for specific color.

relationships:
  - input_grid: Contains the initial arrangement of pixels.
  - output_grid: Contains the transformed arrangement of pixels.
  - pixel-to-pixel: Mapping between pixels in the input and output grids (some are preserved, others are removed or reordered).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** In the input grid, identify pixels with the values 1, 4, 6, and 9.

2.  **Preserve Key Pixels values and position:**
    Copy the values of the pixels from the last row into the output, at their respective position

3. **Remove other position:** Remove the non key pixels from the first, second and third rows.

4.  **Rearrange Zeroes:**
Fill the remaining cells of the output grid with zeros.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
