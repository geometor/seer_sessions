The input grid contains single-digit integers (0-9) representing different colors. The output grid appears to be a rearrangement of some of the elements from the input grid. Some elements are removed, and positions are changed. The consistent elements are those with values 1, 4, 6, and 9. The zeros are also present in both but their relative positions are changed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
