The input grid appears to be a larger version of the output grid, suggesting some form of reduction or extraction. The colors (represented by numbers) seem to be preserved in the transformation, while their arrangement and quantity are altered.  It looks like the input is simply being downscaled/cropped.  The core object is the entire grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
