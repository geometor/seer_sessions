# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 1
0 1 1 0 2 2 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2
1 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 2 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7EF8F17DD990>

**output:**
```
1 1 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x64 at 0x7EF8F17DD7B0>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a larger grid (9x9) containing various colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-2, corresponding to white, blue, and red). The output is a much smaller grid (1x5), seemingly summarizing some aspect of the input grid, containing blue and white. The most obvious initial hypothesis is some form of object counting, which is supported by the prompt's instructions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions:
      input: 9x9
      output: 1x5
    elements: pixels
    element_types:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: blue
        value: 1
      - color: red
        value: 2
  - type: count_summary # added the type to specify the objects in the output
    elements: digits

actions:
    - type: count
      target: objects of specific color
      condition: by row or by whole board

relationships:
    - input_grid: contains multiple colored objects
    - output_grid: represents a summarized form of count for the input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count Blue Objects:** Count the total number of blue (value '1') pixels present in the entire input grid.
2.  **Count White Objects at edges**: Count number of times a white pixel is at the edge (first row, last row, first column or last column)
3. **Construct Output:** Create an output grid of 1x5 dimension and the first two elements contain the two counts and fill the rest with zero.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
