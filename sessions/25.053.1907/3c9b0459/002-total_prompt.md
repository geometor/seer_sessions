# Example

**input:**
```
2 2 1
2 1 2
2 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7EF8F235FA00>

**output:**
```
1 8 2
2 1 2
1 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7EF8F2113E50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The transformation seems to involve a rotation or reflection of the grid. It's not a simple color substitution, as the spatial arrangement of the pixels changes.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)
  - observation: spatial_rearrangement
    details: The positions of colors change between input and output.
  - operation: possible_rotation_or_reflection
    details:  The transformation is likely a 180-degree rotation or a combination of horizontal and vertical reflections.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a 180-degree rotation of the grid.  Each pixel in the input grid is mapped to a new position in the output grid such that its row and column indices are reversed relative to the maximum indices. For example, pixel at (0,0) in input goes to (2,2) in output, and pixel at (1,0) goes to (1,2).

More explicitly we rotate the elements clockwise, twice.
First rotation:

```
2 2 1      2 2 2      8 1 2
2 1 2  ->  8 1 2  ->  1 2 2
2 8 1      1 1 2      2 2 1
```


Second rotation:

```
8 1 2       1 8 2
1 2 2   ->  2 1 2
2 2 1       1 2 2
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
