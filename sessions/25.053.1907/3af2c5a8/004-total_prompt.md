Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1. **Expand the Grid:** Double the dimensions of the input grid. The number of rows in the output grid is twice the number of rows in the input grid. The number of columns in the output grid is twice the number of columns in the input grid.

2. **Replicate and shift the azure pixels:** For each azure (8) pixel in the input, create a copy and a new cell to the right.

3. Fill with 0: all other locations are now filled with a 0.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were overly specific to the first training example. It correctly identified the doubling of the grid dimensions and attempted to replicate/shift a specific color (azure - 8). However, it failed to generalize to other colors and patterns present in the subsequent examples. The core issue is that the rule is color-specific and doesn't account for the actual transformation logic, which seems to involve replicating *all* colors, not just azure, and expanding them in a 2x2 block pattern in the output grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze all Examples:** Carefully examine *all* input/output pairs to identify the common transformation rule. The rule works by expanding a 1x1 cell from the input grid into a 2x2 block.
2.  **Generalize the Color:** Modify the logic to apply to *any* color present in the input grid, not just azure (8).
3. **YAML Summary and Natural Language Program**: I will be sure to document my observations correctly and update the natural language program, this is the main method to solving the task.
4.  **Revise Code:** Generate new Python code that reflects the updated, generalized transformation rule.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

Here's a more detailed breakdown of each example, including some targeted observations to guide the code revision:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    0 0 8 0
    0 8 0 8
    0 0 8 0
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0
    0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0
    0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0
    0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0
    0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0
    0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0
    ```

* **Problem**: Only expands and handles azure pixels, it does correctly expand but not in the correct location. It seems to understand the 2x2 expansion, but misapplies the row logic.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    0 0 3 3
    0 3 0 3
    3 3 3 0
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3
    0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3
    0 0 3 3 0 0 3 3
    0 0 3 3 0 0 3 3
    3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0
    3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0
    3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3
    3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3
    ```
* **Problem**: The code does not replicate the green color. The output shows how the replication works.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    3 3 3 3
    3 0 0 0
    3 0 0 0
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
    3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
    ```
* **Problem**: Again the replication is missing, and only the azure color is moved.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: doubled in both rows and columns
      - transformation: each input pixel becomes a 2x2 block in the output
      - color_invariance: transformation applies to all colors, not just one
  - action: replicate
    details: Every pixel of input becomes a 2x2 block of the same color
  - action: expand
    details: Grid expands by a factor of 2.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expand Grid:** Double the dimensions of the input grid to create the output grid.
2.  **Replicate Pixels:** For *each* pixel in the input grid, create a 2x2 block of the *same* color in the output grid. The top-left cell of this 2x2 block corresponds to the position of the original pixel multiplied by two. In other words: Every element at input\_grid\[row, col] becomes a 2x2 block at output\_grid\[row\*2:row\*2+2, col\*2:col\*2+2].

This revised natural language program is much more accurate and generalizable than the original. It captures the essence of the transformation without being tied to specific colors or edge cases.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
