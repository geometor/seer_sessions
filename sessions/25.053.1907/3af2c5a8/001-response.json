Both grids contain single-digit integer values, representing colors. The primary color observed is 0 (white) and 8 (azure). The output grid appears to be an expansion of the input grid, both in terms of dimensions and the arrangement of the azure (8) pixels. The white (0) pixels seem to act as a background or filler.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
