# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7EF8F23F6B30>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 8 1 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each represented by a single digit integer (0-9). The primary colors involved seem to be white (0) and azure (8). The transformation appears to involve the introduction of blue (1) pixels in specific locations within the azure regions.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are of the same dimensions (7x7).
  - object: |
      Azure (8) colored regions.
  - property: |
      Azure regions are contiguous.
  - object: |
      Blue (1) colored pixels.
  - action: |
      Blue pixels are introduced within the existing azure regions.
  - relationship: |
      The placement of blue pixels seems to be related to the internal positions within the azure regions. Specifically, blue pixels only replace the azure when a pixel has four adjacent azure pixels.
  - constraint: The number of changed pixels are relatively small, related to internal azure pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Locate Internal Pixels:** Within each azure region, identify the azure pixels that have four cardinally adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) that are also azure.
3.  **Introduce Blue:** Change the value of azure pixels determined in the previous step to blue (1).
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid retain their original values.
5. **Output:** The output should match the input grid, except with the value of the identified internal azure pixels changed to blue.

Essentially, the rule seems to be about changing "internal" azure pixels (surrounded on all four sides by other azure pixels) to blue.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
