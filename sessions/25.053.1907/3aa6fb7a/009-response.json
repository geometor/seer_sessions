            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies azure (8) regions but makes an incorrect assumption about which azure pixels to transform to blue (1). It only considers pixels with *four* azure neighbors as \"internal\".  The examples demonstrate that the rule is more nuanced: an azure pixel is considered \"internal\" if it is part of a contiguous 2x2 block of azure. This is important because, visually, it's how the \"internal\" pixels are determined. It's essential to re-evaluate not just individual neighbors, but also *their* neighbors to identify these 2x2 regions.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Internal Pixel Identification:** Instead of checking only direct neighbors, we need to check for the existence of a 2x2 azure square.\n2.  **Iterate and Validate:** Apply the updated logic to all training examples and re-evaluate the mismatches.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary of the provided test results, including my observations and the problems.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input Shape:** (7, 7)\n    *   **Expected Output Shape:** (7, 7)\n    *   **Transformed Output Shape:** (7, 7)\n    *   **Match:** False\n    *   **Pixels Off:** 2\n    *   **Size Correct:** True\n    *   **Color Palette Correct:** True\n    *   **Correct Pixel Counts:** False\n    * **Problem:** fails to change appropriate pixels to blue\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input Shape:** (7, 7)\n    *   **Expected Output Shape:** (7, 7)\n    *   **Transformed Output Shape:** (7, 7)\n    *   **Match:** False\n    *   **Pixels Off:** 3\n    *   **Size Correct:** True\n    *   **Color Palette Correct:** True\n    *   **Correct Pixel Counts:** False\n        *   **Problem:** fails to change appropriate pixels to blue\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 008\nobjects:\n  - color: azure (8)\n    shape: contiguous regions\n    property: can be internal or external\n  - color: blue (1)\n    shape: derived from internal azure pixels\nactions:\n  - identify: find all contiguous regions of azure\n  - identify: find all *internal* azure pixels within each region, defined as part of 2x2 azure block\n  - transform: change color of identified internal azure pixels to blue\n  - preserve: keep all other pixels unchanged\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) colored pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Identify Internal Azure Pixels:** Within each azure region, identify \"internal\" azure pixels. An azure pixel is considered \"internal\" if it is part of a 2x2 square of adjacent azure pixels.\n3.  **Transform Internal Pixels:** Change the color of all identified \"internal\" azure pixels to blue (1).\n4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid (non-internal azure pixels and pixels of other colors) remain unchanged.\n"
