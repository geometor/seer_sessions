The \"L\" can be in any orientation (normal, reversed, rotated).\n\n2.  **Locate the insertion point:** For each identified \"L\" shape, determine the \"inner corner\" pixel. This is the pixel *adjacent* to all three azure pixels of the L, but contained within the 2x2 bounding box of the object.\n\n3.  **Insert Blue Pixel:** Change the color of the inner corner pixel to blue (color 1).\n\n**Explanation and Improvements Based on Test Cases**\n\nThe original code and description had two main flaws, which are addressed above:\n\n*   **Incorrect \"L\" detection and inner corner logic**: It wasn't accurately placing the insertion relative to each L correctly. The updated natural language simplifies: it should be within the 2x2 bounding box and adjacent to all azure parts of the L.\n* **Missing inner corner:** My original code didn't correctly consider reversed and rotated Ls\n\nThe key improvement is focusing on the *geometric relationship* within the L-shape.  We find the \"inner corner\".  This is more robust than relying on sorting, which failed in previous testing.\n"
