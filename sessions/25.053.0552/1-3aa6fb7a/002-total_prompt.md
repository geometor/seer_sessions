Okay, I will analyze the provided input and output grids to determine the transformation rule. Here's my approach:

**1. Observation and Fact Gathering**

I will first carefully examine the input and output grids, noting the positions and colors of pixels. I'll document these observations in a YAML block.


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_size: 7x7
  - output_grid_size: 7x7
  - input_objects:
    - object1:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: L-shape, composed of two adjacent azure pixels
      - initial_position: (1,1), (2,1) # row, col
    - object2:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: reverse L-shape, composed of two adjacent azure pixels.
      - initial_position:  (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)
  - output_objects:
    - object1:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: L-shape, composed of two adjacent azure pixels
      - final_position: (1,1), (2,1)
    - object2:
       - color: azure (8)
       - shape: reverse L-shape
       - final_position: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)
    - new_pixel:
      - color: blue(1)
      - position: (2,2)
    - new_pixel2:
      - color: blue (1)
      - position: (4,4)
```


**2. Identify Relationships and Transformations**

Now I will try to relate the facts to understand the transformation logic.

- The overall grid size remains the same (7x7).
- The azure objects (color 8) from the input, keep the shape and size in the
  output, so we can conclude they are not changed, except potentially their
  location.
- There are two new blue pixels in the output. One inside of each of the azure
  shapes.

**3. Natural Language Program**

Based on the above, I'll create a natural language program describing the transformation.

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (8) colored objects in the
    input grid. Specifically those with shape of an L.
2.  **Maintain Azure objects:**  The two azure objects are not altered.
3.  **Add Blue Pixel:** For each azure object, add new blue(1) pixel inside the
    L-Shape.

**Summary**
The program consists of finding all azure L-shaped objects, and inserting a
blue pixel inside each "L".

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
