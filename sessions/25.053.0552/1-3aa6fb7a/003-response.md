Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and refine the natural language program description.

Here's a breakdown of the observed transformation, incorporating the feedback from the failed test cases:

**Natural Language Program (Revised)**

1.  **Identify "L" shapes:** Find all contiguous objects composed of exactly three azure (color 8) pixels that form an "L" shape. The "L" can be in any orientation (normal, reversed, rotated).

2.  **Locate the insertion point:** For each identified "L" shape, determine the "inner corner" pixel. This is the pixel *adjacent* to all three azure pixels of the L, but contained within the 2x2 bounding box of the object.

3.  **Insert Blue Pixel:** Change the color of the inner corner pixel to blue (color 1).

**Explanation and Improvements Based on Test Cases**

The original code and description had two main flaws, which are addressed above:

*   **Incorrect "L" detection and inner corner logic**: It wasn't accurately placing the insertion relative to each L correctly. The updated natural language simplifies: it should be within the 2x2 bounding box and adjacent to all azure parts of the L.
* **Missing inner corner:** My original code didn't correctly consider reversed and rotated Ls

The key improvement is focusing on the *geometric relationship* within the L-shape.  We find the "inner corner".  This is more robust than relying on sorting, which failed in previous testing.
