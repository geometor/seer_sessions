One inside of each of the azure\n  shapes.\n\n**3. Natural Language Program**\n\nBased on the above, I'll create a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (8) colored objects in the\n    input grid. Specifically those with shape of an L.\n2.  **Maintain Azure objects:**  The two azure objects are not altered.\n3.  **Add Blue Pixel:** For each azure object, add new blue(1) pixel inside the\n    L-Shape.\n\n**Summary**\nThe program consists of finding all azure L-shaped objects, and inserting a\nblue pixel inside each \"L\".\n"
