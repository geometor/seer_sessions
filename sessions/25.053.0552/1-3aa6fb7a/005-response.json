Identify Relationships and Transformations**\n\n- The overall grid size remains the same (7x7).\n- The azure objects (color 8) from the input keep their shape and size in the\n  output.\n- There are three new blue pixels in the output, and three azure objects in\n  the input and output. One inside each of the L shapes.\n\n**3. Natural Language Program**\n\nBased on the above, I can confirm that my initial natural language program\nremains correct. The transformation rule doesn't change.\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (8) colored objects in the\n    input grid. Specifically those with the shape of an L (of three pixels).\n2.  **Maintain Azure objects:**  The two azure objects are not altered.\n3.  **Add Blue Pixel:** For each azure object, add new blue(1) pixel inside the\n    L-Shape.\n\n**Summary**\nThe program consists of finding all azure L-shaped objects, and inserting a\nblue pixel inside each \"L\".\n"
