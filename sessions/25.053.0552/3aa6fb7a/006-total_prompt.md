Okay, I will analyze the provided input and output grids to determine the transformation rule. Here's my approach:

**1. Observation and Fact Gathering**

I will first carefully examine the input and output grids, noting the positions and colors of pixels. I'll document these observations in a YAML block.


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_size: 7x7
  - output_grid_size: 7x7
  - input_objects:
    - object1:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: L-shape, composed of two adjacent azure pixels
      - initial_position: (1,1), (2,1) # row, col
    - object2:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: reverse L-shape, composed of two adjacent azure pixels.
      - initial_position:  (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)
  - output_objects:
    - object1:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: L-shape, composed of two adjacent azure pixels
      - final_position: (1,1), (2,1)
    - object2:
       - color: azure (8)
       - shape: reverse L-shape
       - final_position: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)
    - new_pixel:
      - color: blue(1)
      - position: (2,2)
    - new_pixel2:
      - color: blue (1)
      - position: (4,4)
```


**2. Identify Relationships and Transformations**

Now I will try to relate the facts to understand the transformation logic.

- The overall grid size remains the same (7x7).
- The azure objects (color 8) from the input, keep the shape and size in the
  output, so we can conclude they are not changed, except potentially their
  location.
- There are two new blue pixels in the output. One inside of each of the azure
  shapes.

**3. Natural Language Program**

Based on the above, I'll create a natural language program describing the transformation.

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (8) colored objects in the
    input grid. Specifically those with shape of an L.
2.  **Maintain Azure objects:**  The two azure objects are not altered.
3.  **Add Blue Pixel:** For each azure object, add new blue(1) pixel inside the
    L-Shape.

**Summary**
The program consists of finding all azure L-shaped objects, and inserting a
blue pixel inside each "L".

```python
"""

import numpy as np

def find_objects(grid, color, shape):
    objects = []
    visited = set()

    def is_valid(r, c):
        return 0 <= r < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= c < grid.shape[1]

    def dfs(r, c, current_object):
        if (r, c) in visited or not is_valid(r, c) or grid[r, c] != color:
            return

        visited.add((r, c))
        current_object.append((r, c))

        neighbors = [(r + 1, c), (r - 1, c), (r, c + 1), (r, c - 1)]
        for nr, nc in neighbors:
            dfs(nr, nc, current_object)
    
    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):
        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):
            if grid[r,c] == color and (r,c) not in visited:
                current_object = []
                dfs(r,c,current_object)

                # simplified shape determination
                if len(current_object) > 1:
                    objects.append(current_object)
    return objects
                

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Find azure objects
    azure_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 8, "L")

    # Add a blue pixel inside each azure L-shape
    for obj in azure_objects:
        if len(obj) == 3: #check it's an L shape
            sorted_obj = sorted(obj)
            # check for L vs reverse L
            if (sorted_obj[0][0] == sorted_obj[1][0] and sorted_obj[1][1] == sorted_obj[2][1]): #check rows and columns
                # L shape, add pixel at +1,+1 from top
                output_grid[sorted_obj[0][0] + 1, sorted_obj[0][1] + 1] = 1
            elif (sorted_obj[0][1] == sorted_obj[1][1] and sorted_obj[1][0] == sorted_obj[2][0]): #reversed L
                # reverse L shape, add pixel at -1,-1 from bottom
                output_grid[sorted_obj[2][0] -1, sorted_obj[2][1]-1]=1

    return output_grid
```

Okay, I will analyze the second provided input and output grids to determine the transformation rule, following the same approach as before.

**1. Observation and Fact Gathering**

I will carefully examine the input and output grids, noting the positions and colors of pixels, and document my observations.


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_size: 7x7
  - output_grid_size: 7x7
  - input_objects:
    - object1:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: reverse L-shape, composed of three adjacent azure pixels
      - initial_position: (0,4), (0,5), (1,5)
    - object2:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: L-shape, composed of three adjacent azure pixels.
      - initial_position:  (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)
    - object3:
        - color: azure(8)
        - shape: reverse L shape
        - initial_position: (5,4),(6,4),(6,3)
  - output_objects:
    - object1:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: reverse L-shape, composed of three adjacent azure pixels
      - final_position: (0,4), (0,5), (1,5)
    - object2:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: L-shape, composed of three adjacent azure pixels.
      - final_position:  (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)
    - object3:
        - color: azure(8)
        - shape: reverse L shape
        - initial_position: (5,4),(6,4),(6,3)
    - new_pixel1:
      - color: blue(1)
      - position: (1,4)
    - new_pixel2:
      - color: blue (1)
      - position: (2,3)
    - new_pixel3:
       - color: blue(1)
       - position: (5,3)
```


**2. Identify Relationships and Transformations**

- The overall grid size remains the same (7x7).
- The azure objects (color 8) from the input keep their shape and size in the
  output.
- There are three new blue pixels in the output, and three azure objects in
  the input and output. One inside each of the L shapes.

**3. Natural Language Program**

Based on the above, I can confirm that my initial natural language program
remains correct. The transformation rule doesn't change.

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (8) colored objects in the
    input grid. Specifically those with the shape of an L (of three pixels).
2.  **Maintain Azure objects:**  The two azure objects are not altered.
3.  **Add Blue Pixel:** For each azure object, add new blue(1) pixel inside the
    L-Shape.

**Summary**
The program consists of finding all azure L-shaped objects, and inserting a
blue pixel inside each "L".

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
