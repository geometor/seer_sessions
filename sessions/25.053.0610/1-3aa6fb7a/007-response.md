Okay, let's analyze the second example pair. Here's the YAML block with my observations:



```yaml
observations:
  - grid_size: 7x7
  - colors:
    - present: [0, 8]
    - added: [1]
  - object_shapes:
    - "three separate L shaped objects of color 8"
  - relative_positions:
    - object_1: top-right
    - object_2: middle-left
    - object_3: bottom-right, mirrored orientation of object_2
```



Here's my step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains three distinct "L"-shaped objects made of azure (color 8) pixels.

2.  **Object Transformations**: Locate the *inside corner* of each L-shape.
    *   If the L is in the top row, the inside corner is one down and one left from the corner
    *   If the L is in the left column, the inside corner is one right and one down from the corner
    *   If the L is in the bottom row (and not the left column), the inside corner is one up and one right.

3.  Change the color of the pixel at each inside corner to blue (1)

The rule is to change the inside corner of each azure L-shaped object to blue. The previous solution attempted to find *all* L-shapes but then only modified the bottom-right one. This new example and description modifies all L-shapes.
