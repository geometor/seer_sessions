Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial observations:



```yaml
observations:
  - grid_size: 7x7
  - colors:
    - present: [0, 8]
    - added: [1]
  - object_shapes:
      - "two separate L shaped objects of color 8"
  - relative_positions:
    - object_1: top-left
    - object_2: bottom-right, mirrored orientation of object_1
```



Here's my step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains two distinct "L"-shaped objects made of azure (color 8) pixels.

2.  **Object 1 Transformation**: The top-left "L" shape remains unchanged.

3.  **Object 2 Transformation**: In the bottom right "L" shaped object color: a single pixel in the corner of the "L", specifically the second to the rightmost and second to the bottommost azure, is changed to blue (value 1).

In essence, the transformation involves changing single corner azure pixel of the mirrored L object in the bottom-right of the input grid to the color blue.
