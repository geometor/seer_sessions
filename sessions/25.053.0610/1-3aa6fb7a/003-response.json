            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the observed transformation, focusing on objects, properties, and actions:\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The primary objects of interest are \"L\"-shaped structures formed by azure (color 8) pixels. An \"L\" shape is defined as a 2x2 block of pixels where one of the corner pixels is missing (of a different color or outside the grid), and all other pixels within the implied 2x2 block are azure.\n\n2.  **Object Selection:** The transformation targets *all* L-shaped objects of azure color, not only two.\n\n3. **Action / Transformation:**\n    *   The inside corner pixel of each identified \"L\" shape is changed to blue (color 1). The inside corner is defined by the place where, if the 2 x 2 square would be completed, the corner would be.\n\n4. **Grid Context:** The rest of the grid remains unchanged. Pixels not part of the identified \"L\" shapes retain their original colors.\n\n**Key Improvements over Previous Description:**\n\n*   **All L-Shapes:** The crucial difference is recognizing that the rule applies to *all* azure L-shapes, not just two. The prior code and description incorrectly limited the search and modification.\n* **Inside corner** The inside corner has been correctly identified. The previous description, while on the right track for one of the shapes, wasn't general.\n\n**Example Application to demonstrate inside corner:**\n\nInput\n```\n0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0\n```\n\n1.  **Identify L-Shapes:**\n    *   Top right: Corner at (0, 5). Inside corner at (1,4)\n    *   Middle Left: Corner at (2, 2). Inside Corner (3,3)\n    *    Bottom Right: Corner at (5, 4). Inside corner at (6,3)\n    \n2. Change those inside corner pixels to blue.\n```\n0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 1 8 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 1 8 0 0\n```\n"
