Status: False
Okay, here's a breakdown of the observed transformation, focusing on objects, properties, and actions:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Object Identification:** The primary objects of interest are "L"-shaped structures formed by azure (color 8) pixels. An "L" shape is defined as a 2x2 block of pixels where one of the corner pixels is missing (of a different color or outside the grid), and all other pixels within the implied 2x2 block are azure.

2.  **Object Selection:** The transformation targets *all* L-shaped objects of azure color, not only two.

3. **Action / Transformation:**
    *   The inside corner pixel of each identified "L" shape is changed to blue (color 1). The inside corner is defined by the place where, if the 2 x 2 square would be completed, the corner would be.

4. **Grid Context:** The rest of the grid remains unchanged. Pixels not part of the identified "L" shapes retain their original colors.

**Key Improvements over Previous Description:**

*   **All L-Shapes:** The crucial difference is recognizing that the rule applies to *all* azure L-shapes, not just two. The prior code and description incorrectly limited the search and modification.
* **Inside corner** The inside corner has been correctly identified. The previous description, while on the right track for one of the shapes, wasn't general.

**Example Application to demonstrate inside corner:**

Input
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

1.  **Identify L-Shapes:**
    *   Top right: Corner at (0, 5). Inside corner at (1,4)
    *   Middle Left: Corner at (2, 2). Inside Corner (3,3)
    *    Bottom Right: Corner at (5, 4). Inside corner at (6,3)
    
2. Change those inside corner pixels to blue.

```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
