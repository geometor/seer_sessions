Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
        shape: Two separate 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal azure blocks.
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
        shape:  Two separate 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal azure blocks.
      - color: 1 (blue)
        positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
        shape: Two single blue cells.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid. There are two distinct shapes formed by azure colored cells: two cells forming a vertical line, and two cells forming a horizontal line.

2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** Copy all azure colored areas to the output grid, in their respective locations.

3.  **Introduce Blue Pixel, Top:** Identify the azure object with the upper-leftmost coordinate. Add a blue (color 1) pixel to the right of its upper-rightmost coordinate.

4. **Introduce Blue Pixel, Bottom:** Identify the azure object with the bottom-leftmost coordinate. Add a blue pixel (color 1) to the left of its bottom-leftmost coordinate.

In summary, the transformation preserves the azure objects and introduces two blue pixels that are placed according to the described rules.
