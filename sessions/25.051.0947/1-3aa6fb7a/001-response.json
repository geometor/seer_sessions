There are two distinct shapes formed by azure colored cells: two cells forming a vertical line, and two cells forming a horizontal line.\n\n2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** Copy all azure colored areas to the output grid, in their respective locations.\n\n3.  **Introduce Blue Pixel, Top:** Identify the azure object with the upper-leftmost coordinate. Add a blue (color 1) pixel to the right of its upper-rightmost coordinate.\n\n4. **Introduce Blue Pixel, Bottom:** Identify the azure object with the bottom-leftmost coordinate. Add a blue pixel (color 1) to the left of its bottom-leftmost coordinate.\n\nIn summary, the transformation preserves the azure objects and introduces two blue pixels that are placed according to the described rules.\n"
