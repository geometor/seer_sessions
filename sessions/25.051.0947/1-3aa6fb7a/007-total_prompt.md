The transformation rule is:

1. Preserve Azure: Copy all azure (color 8) objects from the input grid to the output grid without changes.

2. Add Blue - Top: Find the uppermost azure object. Place a blue pixel (color 1) to the right of its rightmost cell.

3. Add Blue - Bottom: Find the lowermost azure object. Place a blue pixel (color 1) to the left of its leftmost cell.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
