Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:
        - (0, 4)
        - (0, 5)
        - (1, 5)
        - (2, 2)
        - (3, 2)
        - (3, 3)
        - (5, 4)
        - (6, 4)
        - (6, 3)
      shape: Three separate L-shaped objects.

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
     - color: 8 (azure)
       positions:
        - (0, 4)
        - (0, 5)
        - (1, 5)
        - (2, 2)
        - (3, 2)
        - (3, 3)
        - (5, 4)
        - (6, 4)
        - (6, 3)
       shape: Three separate L-shaped objects.
     - color: 1 (blue)
       positions:
        - (1, 4)
        - (2, 3)
        - (5,3)
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all azure (color 8) colored objects within the input grid. In this instance, we can discern three distinct L-shaped configurations.

2. **Change Color:** Change single azure cell on the right side and the top of each object to color 1.

3.  **Preservation:** The remaining cells, including the unchanged parts of the azure structures, maintain their original colors.

*Essence:* This transformation processes the input grid by pinpointing each azure object and recoloring particular azure elements at the upper and right boundaries to blue.
