Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:
        - (1, 1)
        - (2, 1)
        - (2, 2)
        - (3, 4)
        - (3, 5)
        - (4, 5)
      shape: Two separate L-shaped objects.

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:
        - (1, 1)
        - (2, 1)
        - (2, 2)
        - (3, 4)
        - (3, 5)
        - (4, 5)
      shape: Two separate L-shaped objects.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions:
        - (1,2)
        - (4,4)

```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) colored objects in the input grid. There are two disconnected L-shaped objects.

2.  **Change Color:** Change single azure cell on the right side and the top of each object to color 1.

3. **Preserve:** All other cells, including the azure objects, stay unchanged.

In Essence: The transformation identifies azure objects and paints the topmost and rightmost with blue color, where those pixels make L shape with others.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
