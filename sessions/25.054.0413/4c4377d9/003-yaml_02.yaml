  - task: 002
    objects:
      - type: row
        properties:
          original_index: int  # 0 to N-1, where N is the number of rows
          colors: list[int]   # List of color values in the row
        actions:
          - reorder:
              description: Rows are reordered before duplication.
              mapping:  # Mapping of original row index to new row index (before duplication)
                0: 2
                1: 1
                2: 0
          - duplicate:

      - note: "The color palette and the pixel counts are preserved in the transformation."
      - note: "rows are reversed"
