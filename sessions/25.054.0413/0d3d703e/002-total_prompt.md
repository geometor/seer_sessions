# Example

**input:**
```
3 1 2
3 1 2
3 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7AE1FE2478E0>

**output:**
```
4 5 6
4 5 6
4 5 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7AE1FE247F10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer. The digits in the input grid seem to correspond to specific colors (as per the color map). The transformation appears to involve adding 1 to each digit in the input grid to produce the output grid. The spatial arrangement of elements remains identical.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    properties:
      - Each cell has a single digit.
      - Cell values correspond to colors.
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    properties:
      - Each cell has a single digit.
      - Cell values correspond to colors.
  - relationship: transformation
    description: input grid transforms to output grid
    rule: Each element in the input grid is incremented by 1 to obtain the corresponding element in the output grid.
    constraints:
      - Spatial layout remains constant
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The program takes a 3x3 input grid of digits and transforms it into a 3x3 output grid. For each cell in the input grid, increment the digit value by 1. The resulting value is placed in the corresponding cell of the output grid. The dimensions and arrangement of cells is unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
