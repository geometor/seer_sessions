# Example

**input:**
```
2 2 1
2 1 2
2 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7AE1FE2477C0>

**output:**
```
1 8 2
2 1 2
1 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7AE1FE00A6E0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. Each integer represents a color. The transformation appears to involve a rotation or reflection of some kind, as the relative positions of the numbers change. The colors (represented by numbers) stay the same, but their locations within the grid are altered. Specifically, it looks like a 180-degree rotation.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    element_properties:
      color: mapped from integer value
  - observation: input grid colors are preserved in output grid
  - transformation:
      type: spatial
      description: "180-degree rotation"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of integers, each representing a color.
2.  **Transformation:** Rotate the entire grid by 180 degrees. This means that the element at position (i, j) will move to position (3-1-i, 3-1-j), where rows and colums are numbered 0 to 2..
3.  **Output:** The rotated 3x3 grid.

Essentially the grid is flipped both horizontally and vertically, which is the equivalent of a 180 degree rotation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
