Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed changes:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains objects of color '8' (which appears to be light blue). All other cells are '0' (grey).

2.  **Locate Corner:** The top right of cluster of color 8 is identified.

3.  **Change Value:** The value of the color 8 at those x, y coordinates is changed to a '1'.
    The top right 8 is where x is max and y is minimal.
    Bottom cluster: of the set of 8s where x is max, the 8 with minimal y.
    Top Cluster: Of the set of 8s where x is max, the 8 with minimal y.

**In summary:** The transformation identifies the rightmost 8's of color '8', then of those the top, and changes those values to '1'. All other values remain the same.
