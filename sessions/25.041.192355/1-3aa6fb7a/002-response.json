Locate the First '8': Scan the input grid row by row, starting from the top row and moving left to right in each row. Identify the coordinates (row and column index) of the very first cell that contains the value 8.\n    2. Modify to the Right of First '8':  Take the coordinates of the first '8' found.  Examine the cell immediately to the right of this '8'. If this cell contains the value 0, change its value to 1 in the output grid.\n    3. Locate the Last '8': Scan the input grid row by row, starting from the top row and moving left to right in each row. Identify the coordinates (row and column index) of the very last cell that contains the value 8.\n    4. Modify to the Left of Last '8': Take the coordinates of the last '8' found. Examine the cell immediately to the left of this '8'. If this cell contains the value 0, change its value to 1 in the output grid.\n\n    This process is applied to transform the input grid into the output grid. Note that if there is no cell to the right of the first '8' (i.e., it's in the last column) or no cell to the left of the last '8' (i.e., it's in the first column), or if the adjacent cell is not 0, no change is made at that step.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid] # Create a copy to avoid modifying input directly\n\n    first_8_location = None\n    last_8_location = None\n\n    # 1. Locate the First '8'\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if output_grid[r][c] == 8:\n                first_8_location = (r, c)\n                break # Exit inner loop once first '8' is found in the row\n        if first_8_location:\n            break # Exit outer loop once first '8' is found\n\n    # 2. Modify to the Right of First '8'\n    if first_8_location:\n        first_8_row, first_8_col = first_8_location\n        if first_8_col + 1 < cols and output_grid[first_8_row][first_8_col + 1] == 0:\n            output_grid[first_8_row][first_8_col + 1] = 1\n\n    # 3. Locate the Last '8'\n    for r in range(rows - 1, -1, -1): # Iterate rows in reverse\n        for c in range(cols - 1, -1, -1): # Iterate columns in reverse\n            if output_grid[r][c] == 8:\n                last_8_location = (r, c)\n                break # Exit inner loop once last '8' is found in the row\n        if last_8_location:\n            break # Exit outer loop once last '8' is found\n\n    # 4. Modify to the Left of Last '8'\n    if last_8_location:\n        last_8_row, last_8_col = last_8_location\n        if last_8_col - 1 >= 0 and output_grid[last_8_row][last_8_col - 1] == 0:\n            output_grid[last_8_row][last_8_col - 1] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
