In this case, we have a red cell at (3, 2) and a blue cell at (6, 6).\n\n2.  **Yellow Surround:** For the red object, place yellow (4) cells above, below, and two cells placed horizontally to form a mirrored L-shape around the red cell on the left. The pattern looks like two vertical lines, placed one row above and other below the identified object.\n\n3. **Orange Surround:** For the blue cell create an L-shape using orange object (color 7) to surround it on the left, using 3 orange cells at the left of the blue object and one cell at the bottom-right, at a distance of one cell.\n\n4.  **Preserve Original Objects:** The original red and blue cells remain in their original positions in the output grid.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n1. Find every object of size 1 in the input.\n2. For each of those objects:\n   - if the object is red:\n     - Place a yellow cell above it.\n     - Place a yellow cell below it.\n     - Place a yellow cell at its left.\n   - if the object is blue:\n     - Place 3 orange cells to form a vertical line at its left.\n     - Place one orange cell at the bottom-right of the blue cell, with distance 1.\n3. Maintain original objects of size 1.\n"
