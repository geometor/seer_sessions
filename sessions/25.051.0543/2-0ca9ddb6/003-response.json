This includes red cells at (2, 6), (7,1), and blue cells at (3, 2), (6,6).\n\n2.  **Yellow Surround:** For each red object, place yellow (4) cells above, below, and two cells placed horizontally to form a mirrored L-shape around the red cell on the left. The pattern looks like two vertical lines, placed one row above and other below the identified object.\n\n3. **Orange Surround:** For each blue cell create an L-shape using orange object (color 7) to surround it on the left, using 3 orange cells at the left of the blue object and one cell at the bottom-right, at a distance of one cell.\n\n4.  **Preserve Original Objects:** The original single cell objects with colors different to 0 remain in their original positions in the output grid.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n1. Find every object of size 1 in the input, except those of color 8.\n2. For each of those objects:\n   - if the object is red:\n     - Place a yellow cell above it.\n     - Place a yellow cell below it.\n     - Place a yellow cell at its left.\n   - if the object is blue:\n     - Place 3 orange cells to form a vertical line at its left.\n     - Place one orange cell at the bottom-right of the blue cell, with distance 1.\n3. Maintain original objects of size 1, except those of color 8.\n\nThis is essentially the same rule as in the first example, with the additional condition of ignoring single-cell objects of color 8. The Python code developed for the first example can be reused, with just a minor addition, the condition to ignore single cell of color 8.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n1.
