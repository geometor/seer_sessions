In detail:\n      - The object of color 1 (blue) moves from (3, 0) to (3, 0).\n      - The object of color 4 (yellow) moves from (0, 1) to (3, 1).\n      - The object of color 6 (magenta) moves from (2, 2) to (3, 2).\n      - The object of color 9 (maroon) moves from (0, 3) to (3, 3).\n\n3. **Final Output**: The other cells, not occupied by the moved objects, become or remain 0.\n\nIn summary, all the single colored cells move to the last row.\nThe cells that are not affected by the move become, or remain, 0.\n"
