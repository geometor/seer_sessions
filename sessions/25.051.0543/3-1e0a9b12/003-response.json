The other object of color 8 remains in its position.\n    - All the other colors objects remain in their position\n\n3. **Final Output**: The other cells, not occupied by the moved objects, become or remain 0.\n\nIn summary, the object of color 9 and one of the objects of color 8 are moved to the last row preserving the column.\nThe cells that are not affected by the move remain 0.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\n1. Identify the objects of color 9 and 8.\n2. Move the object of color 9 to the last row of the grid, maintaining its column position.\n3. Move the object of color 8 that is most on top to the last row preserving its column.\n4. All other cells in the grid remain the same.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Get the dimensions of the input grid.\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    \n    #Move the object of color 9.\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 9:\n                output_grid[rows - 1, c] = 9\n                if r!= rows-1:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 0\n\n    # Move one object of color 8\n    found = False\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 8 and not found:\n                output_grid[rows - 1, c] = 8\n                if r != rows -1:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 0\n                found = True\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
