Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: two separate 2x1 rectangles
        positions:
          - (1,1) & (2,1) # First rectangle
          - (3,4) & (4,5) & (3,5) & (4,4)  # Second set, forms an L shape.
    background_color: 0 (white)
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: two separate 2x1 rectangles
        positions:
          - (1,1) & (2,1) # First rectangle
          - (3,4) & (4,5) & (3,5) & (4,4)  # Second set, forms an L shape.
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: two single cells
        positions:
            - (1,2)
            - (4,4)
    background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One L object is present in the corner of the 2x2 azure square and one azure object is present on the other corner.

2.  **Detect Change:** The transformation involves the introduction of blue (color 1) pixels.

3.  **Predicate for Blue Pixel Placement:**. Place the new pixel (with value = 1) to the right of the top azure object.

4. **Predicate for Blue Pixel Placement:**. Place the new pixel (with value = 1) to the left of the bottom azure object.
