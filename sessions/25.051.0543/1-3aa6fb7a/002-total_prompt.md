Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: two separate 2x1 rectangles
        positions:
          - (1,1) & (2,1) # First rectangle
          - (3,4) & (4,5) & (3,5) & (4,4)  # Second set, forms an L shape.
    background_color: 0 (white)
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: two separate 2x1 rectangles
        positions:
          - (1,1) & (2,1) # First rectangle
          - (3,4) & (4,5) & (3,5) & (4,4)  # Second set, forms an L shape.
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: two single cells
        positions:
            - (1,2)
            - (4,4)
    background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One L object is present in the corner of the 2x2 azure square and one azure object is present on the other corner.

2.  **Detect Change:** The transformation involves the introduction of blue (color 1) pixels.

3.  **Predicate for Blue Pixel Placement:**. Place the new pixel (with value = 1) to the right of the top azure object.

4. **Predicate for Blue Pixel Placement:**. Place the new pixel (with value = 1) to the left of the bottom azure object.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
