Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this fourth example.

**YAML Block for Initial Observations:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    objects:
      - color: 9
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 4
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 2
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
  output_grid:
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    objects:
      - color: 8
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 3
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 6
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program (Step-by-Step Transformation):**

1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines of cells. The first vertical line is composed of cells with color 9 (maroon), the second of cells with color 4 (yellow), and the third of cells with color 2 (red).

2.  **Color Transformation:** Each color in the input grid is transformed to a new, unique color in the output grid. The specific mapping observed is:

    *   Input color 9 (maroon) becomes output color 8 (azure).
    *   Input color 4 (yellow) becomes output color 3 (green).
    *   Input color 2 (red) becomes output color 6 (magenta).

3.  **Shape and Position Preservation:** The shape (vertical lines) and the relative positions of the colored lines are preserved during the transformation. The output grid has the same dimensions (3x3) as the input grid.

4.  **Transformation Rule**:
    * Subtract one (-1) to the first vertical line.
    * Subtract one (-1) to the second vertical line.
    * Add four (+4) to the third vertical line.

**Summary of the Transformation Rule:**

The transformation involves a consistent color mapping where each color in the input is replaced by a specific corresponding color in the output, maintaining the geometric structure. The transformation rule subtracts -1 to the first and second object, and adds +4 to the third. The existing `transform` function and `color_map` should continue working without modification.
