            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this third example.\n\n**YAML Block for Initial Observations:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  input_grid:\n    dimensions: [3, 3]\n    objects:\n      - color: 5\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n      - color: 8\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n      - color: 6\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n  output_grid:\n    dimensions: [3, 3]\n    objects:\n      - color: 1\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n      - color: 9\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n      - color: 2\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Step-by-Step Transformation):**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines of cells. The first vertical line is composed of cells with color 5 (gray), the second of cells with color 8 (azure), and the third of cells with color 6 (magenta).\n\n2.  **Color Transformation:** Each color in the input grid is transformed to a new, unique color in the output grid. The specific mapping observed is:\n\n    *   Input color 5 (gray) becomes output color 1 (blue).\n    *   Input color 8 (azure) becomes output color 9 (maroon).\n    *   Input color 6 (magenta) becomes output color 2 (red).\n\n3.  **Shape and Position Preservation:** The shape (vertical lines) and the relative positions of the colored lines are preserved during the transformation. The output grid has the same dimensions (3x3) as the input grid.\n\n4.  **Transformation Rule:**\n   * Subtract four (-4) to the first vertical line.\n   * Add one (+1) to the second vertical line.\n   * Subtract four (-4) from the third vertical line.\n\n**Summary of the Transformation Rule:**\n\nThe transformation involves a consistent color mapping where each color in the input is replaced by a specific corresponding color in the output, maintaining the geometric structure. The transformation rule subtracts -4 to the first object's index, adds +1 to the second, and subtracts -4 from the third.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation involves a consistent color mapping where each color in the input is replaced by a specific corresponding color in the output, maintaining the geometric structure. The mapping is as follows: 5 (gray) -> 1 (blue), 8 (azure) -> 9 (maroon), and 6 (magenta) -> 2 (red). The grid dimensions and object shapes/positions are preserved.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid to the output grid based on a color mapping rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Define the color mapping.\n    color_map = {\n        5: 1,  # Gray to Blue\n        8: 9,  # Azure to Maroon\n        6: 2   # Magenta to Red\n    }\n\n    # Iterate through the input grid and apply the color transformation.\n    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):\n            input_color = input_grid[i, j]\n            # Use the color map to determine the output color, default to 0 if not found.\n            output_color = color_map.get(input_color, input_color)  # Default to input color if not in color_map.\n            output_grid[i, j] = output_color\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
