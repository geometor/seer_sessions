            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.\n\n**YAML Block for Initial Observations:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  input_grid:\n    dimensions: [3, 3]\n    objects:\n      - color: 2\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n      - color: 3\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n      - color: 8\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n  output_grid:\n    dimensions: [3, 3]\n    objects:\n      - color: 6\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n      - color: 4\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n      - color: 9\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Step-by-Step Transformation):**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines of cells. The first vertical line has cells of color 2 (red), the second of color 3 (green), and the third of color 8 (azure).\n\n2.  **Color Transformation:** Each unique color in the input grid is transformed to a new, unique color in the output grid. The observed mapping is:\n\n    *   Input color 2 (red) becomes output color 6 (magenta).\n    *   Input color 3 (green) becomes output color 4 (yellow).\n    *   Input color 8 (azure) becomes output color 9 (maroon).\n\n3.  **Shape and Position Preservation:** The shape (vertical lines) and relative positions of the lines are maintained.  The output grid, like the input grid, is 3x3.\n\n4.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    - Add four (+4) to the first vertical line. The output grid takes the color index in the input grid and transforms it by adding +4 to the cell index.\n    - Add one (+1) to the second vertical line. The output grid takes the color index in the input grid and transforms it by adding +1 to the cell index.\n    - Add one (+1) to the third vertical line. The output grid takes the color index in the input grid and transforms it by adding +1 to the cell index.\n\n**Summary of the Transformation Rule:**\n\nThe transformation is a color mapping where each color in the input is replaced by a corresponding color in the output, preserving the geometric structure. The transformation rule adds +4 to the index of the first object, +1 to the second, and +1 to the third.\n"
