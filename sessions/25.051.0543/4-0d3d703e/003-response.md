Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.

**YAML Block for Initial Observations:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    objects:
      - color: 2
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 3
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 8
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
  output_grid:
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    objects:
      - color: 6
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 4
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 9
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program (Step-by-Step Transformation):**

1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines of cells. The first vertical line has cells of color 2 (red), the second of color 3 (green), and the third of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Color Transformation:** Each unique color in the input grid is transformed to a new, unique color in the output grid. The observed mapping is:

    *   Input color 2 (red) becomes output color 6 (magenta).
    *   Input color 3 (green) becomes output color 4 (yellow).
    *   Input color 8 (azure) becomes output color 9 (maroon).

3.  **Shape and Position Preservation:** The shape (vertical lines) and relative positions of the lines are maintained.  The output grid, like the input grid, is 3x3.

4.  **Transformation Rule:**
    - Add four (+4) to the first vertical line. The output grid takes the color index in the input grid and transforms it by adding +4 to the cell index.
    - Add one (+1) to the second vertical line. The output grid takes the color index in the input grid and transforms it by adding +1 to the cell index.
    - Add one (+1) to the third vertical line. The output grid takes the color index in the input grid and transforms it by adding +1 to the cell index.

**Summary of the Transformation Rule:**

The transformation is a color mapping where each color in the input is replaced by a corresponding color in the output, preserving the geometric structure. The transformation rule adds +4 to the index of the first object, +1 to the second, and +1 to the third.
