            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this fourth example.\n\n**YAML Block for Initial Observations:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  input_grid:\n    dimensions: [3, 3]\n    objects:\n      - color: 9\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n      - color: 4\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n      - color: 2\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n  output_grid:\n    dimensions: [3, 3]\n    objects:\n      - color: 8\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n      - color: 3\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n      - color: 6\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Step-by-Step Transformation):**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines of cells. The first vertical line is composed of cells with color 9 (maroon), the second of cells with color 4 (yellow), and the third of cells with color 2 (red).\n\n2.  **Color Transformation:** Each color in the input grid is transformed to a new, unique color in the output grid. The specific mapping observed is:\n\n    *   Input color 9 (maroon) becomes output color 8 (azure).\n    *   Input color 4 (yellow) becomes output color 3 (green).\n    *   Input color 2 (red) becomes output color 6 (magenta).\n\n3.  **Shape and Position Preservation:** The shape (vertical lines) and the relative positions of the colored lines are preserved during the transformation. The output grid has the same dimensions (3x3) as the input grid.\n\n4.  **Transformation Rule**:\n    * Subtract one (-1) to the first vertical line.\n    * Subtract one (-1) to the second vertical line.\n    * Add four (+4) to the third vertical line.\n\n**Summary of the Transformation Rule:**\n\nThe transformation involves a consistent color mapping where each color in the input is replaced by a specific corresponding color in the output, maintaining the geometric structure. The transformation rule subtracts -1 to the first and second object, and adds +4 to the third. The existing `transform` function and `color_map` should continue working without modification.\n"
