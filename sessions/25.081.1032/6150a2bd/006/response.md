Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial transformation rule (transpose and reverse rows) was too simplistic and only coincidentally worked for some parts of the provided examples. The results clearly show a mismatch between the expected and transformed outputs in both provided examples. The consistent `pixels_off` count of 6 suggests a systematic error related to how the transposition and reversal are being applied or interpreted, rather than random errors. My initial assumption was incorrect. I need to revise the core logic of the transformation. The color palette is consistent, so the issue lies purely in the spatial rearrangement of pixels.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze the input and expected output grids *without* pre-conceived notions from the previous attempt. Look for direct mappings of pixel positions from input to output.  I will use python to create mappings and compare pixel locations
2.  **Identify Core Operation:**  The previous approach was based on global operations (transpose, flip). I will consider more localized operations or different global transformations.
3.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Create a new, precise description of the *correct* transformation rule based on the re-examination.
4.  **Test Thoroughly:** Use the results to inform development of the function in the next step.

**Gather Metrics and Develop Reports:**

I need to understand exactly *which* pixels are incorrect.

**Analysis of Tool Output:**

The tool output confirms the mismatches and provides crucial details:

*   **Differences between Expected and Transformed:** These lists show the exact coordinates where the transformed output differs from the expected output.  This confirms the systematic nature of the error.
*   **Pixel Mapping:** This is the most valuable output. It shows how each pixel in the input grid *should* map to a position in the output grid.  Let's analyze these mappings:

    *   **Example 1 Mapping:** `{(0, 0): (1, 2), (0, 1): (1, 2), (0, 2): (2, 0), (1, 0): (1, 2), (1, 1): (1, 1), (1, 2): (0, 0), (2, 0): (0, 2), (2, 1): (0, 0), (2, 2): (0, 0)}`
    *   **Example 2 Mapping:** `{(0, 0): (2, 1), (0, 1): (2, 1), (0, 2): (2, 0), (1, 0): (1, 2), (1, 1): (0, 0), (1, 2): (0, 0), (2, 0): (0, 0), (2, 1): (0, 0), (2, 2): (0, 0)}`

Looking at the pixel mappings, I notice a pattern. Let's denote input coordinates as (i, j) and output coordinates as (o\_i, o\_j). The mapping appears to be:

o\_i = j
o\_j = grid\_height - 1 - i

Let's test this.
Example 1:
(0,0) -> (0, 3-1-0) = (0, 2) - incorrect, should be (1,2)
Example 2:
(0,0) -> (0, 3-1-0) = (0,2) - incorrect, should be (2,1)

Another try, looking at the pattern: the x and y are being flipped, then
o\_i = grid\_width - 1- j
o\_j = i

Example 1:
(0,0) -> (2, 0) - no
(0,1) -> (1, 0) - no
(0,2) -> (0, 0) - no

Final try - reverse the order:
o\_i = n_rows - j - 1
o\_j = i

Example 1, input (0,0) becomes (3-0-1, 0) = (2,0) - no,
Example 2, input (0,0) becomes (3-0-1, 0) = (2, 0) no
Ok, lets try another transformation

o\_i = n_cols - 1 - j
o\_j = i

Example 1:
Input(0, 0) -> Output(3-1-0, 0) = (2, 0). NO!

It seems the transformation is a reflection across the anti-diagonal.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
transformation_type: reflection
reflection_axis: anti-diagonal
object_interaction: none
objects:
    - description: individual pixels
      properties:
          color: integer (0-9)
          position: (row, column)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a reflection (or a flip) of the input grid across its anti-diagonal (the diagonal line from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner). This means that the element at position (i, j) in the input grid will be moved to the position (n\_cols - 1 - j, n\_rows - 1 - i) in the output grid, where n\_rows is the number of rows, and n\_cols is the number of columns in the input grid.
