Okay, I'm ready to analyze this task. Here's my breakdown of the input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs are grids of varying sizes (3x3 in the examples).
*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color.
*   The outputs are smaller grids, also containing single-digit integers.
*   The output grids seem to be related to the non-zero values in the input grids.
*   The output size varies and does not have any obvious correlation to input size.
*   There's a clear focus on the non-zero color pixels. The background color is consistently zero (white).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: 3
      - height: 3
      - cells: integers (0-9)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
      - cells: integers (0-9)
  - name: non_zero_pixels
    type: set
    properties:
      - values: unique non-zero integers from input_grid

actions:
  - name: extract_non_zero
    description: Identify all non-zero pixels in the input grid.
  - name: create_output
    description: Construct the output grid using the extracted non-zero pixels.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains non_zero_pixels
  - output_grid is derived from non_zero_pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Examine the input grid and identify all pixels with values other than 0.
2.  **Extract Unique Values:** Create a set of the *unique* non-zero values found in the input grid.
3.  **Construct Output:** Create a new output grid. The number of cells in this output grid is equal to number of times the non-zero value appears in the input grid. Populate *all* output grid cells with the non-zero value. If there are more than one non-zero values, consider only the first encountered non-zero value.

In summary: The transformation extracts the first unique non-zero value from the input grid and creates an output grid filled with that color, where the number of cells in the output grid equals to the number of time the first non-zero color appeared in input grid.
