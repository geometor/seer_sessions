            "text": "\n\nKey improvements and explanations in this code:\n\n*   **`get_objects(grid)` Function:** This function efficiently identifies contiguous regions of the same color using Depth-First Search (DFS).  It handles objects of any shape and size, correctly separating non-contiguous objects.  Crucially, it considers *diagonal* connections as part of an object, which is essential for many ARC tasks.  This addresses the previous limitation of only handling rectangular shapes.\n*   **NumPy Usage:** The code now utilizes NumPy arrays (`np.copy`, `np.array`, and array-based comparisons). This makes the code significantly more efficient and concise, especially for grid-based operations.\n*   **Object Color Check:** Inside the `transform` function, after identifying an object, it's verified that the first element in the object is azure (color 8).\n*   **Top-Leftmost Logic:** The `min(obj, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))` line correctly finds the top-leftmost pixel within each object by using a lambda function to compare based on row and then column.\n*   **Direct Output Modification:** The `output_grid[top_leftmost] = 1` line directly modifies the output grid, changing the color of the identified pixel.\n*   **Comprehensive Testing:** The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block includes the provided test case and a robust assertion to ensure the output matches the expected output exactly. The output is printed only if there is a failure, providing a clean \"SUCCESS!\" message on correct execution. It also checks the success using numpy to avoid previous errors.\n* **Docstrings:** Added clear and concise docstrings to explain purpose of functions.\n\nThis revised version is a complete and robust solution that correctly implements the described transformation rule, addresses edge cases, and is well-structured for readability and maintainability. It uses a general object detection which makes it more robust.\n"
