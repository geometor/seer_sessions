Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both 10x10 grids.
*   The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   Most of the grid is filled with '0' (white), representing the background.
*   There are a few colored 2x2 squares in the input.
*    one is orange (7) and magenta (6) on top and maroon(9) and yellow(4) below.
*   another one is azure(8)
*   The output seems to rearrange one of the 2x2 squares. The azure square is gone and the orange/magenta/maroon/yellow one appears to have been moved and duplicated, so two squares are now present

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: square
    dimensions: 2x2
    colors:
        - top_left: 7 #orange
          top_right: 6 #magenta
          bottom_left: 9 #maroon
          bottom_right: 4 #yellow
        - top_left: 8 #azure
          top_right: 8
          bottom_left: 8
          bottom_right: 8

actions:
  - type: move
    object: square_ommy
    new_location: Some location, potentially based on certain rules.
  - type: duplicate_move
    object: square_ommy
    new_location: Some other locations, potentially based on certain rules, and appear to move the object while duplicating.
  - type: delete
    object: square_azure

relationships:
  - input_grid: contains multiple squares
  - output_grid: contains moved and possibly duplicated squares, and deleted squares.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Squares:** Locate all 2x2 squares of non-zero pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Target Square**: Select the square composed of orange(7), magenta(6), maroon(9), and yellow(4) pixels.
3.  **Move and Duplicate:** Move this square down, so that it will align with the bottom of the grid, creating copies, one shifted toward the right so as to be aligned with the final column.
4. **Remove**: Delete/Remove the azure(8) square.
5.  **Output:** Generate the new grid with the moved, duplicated and deleted squares.

Essentially, the transformation involves identifying a specific 2x2 colored square, moving/copying it to two new specified locations based on the structure and removing another identified square.
