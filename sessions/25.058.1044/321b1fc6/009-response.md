Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of digits, where each digit represents a color. The transformation seems to involve a color substitution, specifically targeting connected regions of the same color.  The azure (8) regions are changing to either orange (7) or magenta (6). The choice between 7 and 6 appears to depend on the row of the azure region: top part is replaced by 7, bottom part by 6.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 10x10
      elements: digits (0-9) representing colors
  - type: region
    properties:
      shape: contiguous block of same-colored pixels
      color: initially azure (8)
      transformation: color change
    relationships:
      - to: other regions (adjacency not relevant in transformation)
      - to: grid (contained within)

actions:
  - name: color_substitution
    agent: unknown (rule-based)
    target: azure (8) regions
    parameters:
      new_color: determined by row index (7 or 6)

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Determine New Color:** For each region, compare to row index. Top part of azure (8) is replaced by Orange color (7). Bottom part of azure (8) is replaced by magenta color (6).
3.  **Substitute:** Replace all pixels within each identified region with the new color that was determined in step 2.
4.  **Output:** Produce the modified grid with the color substitutions. All other colors remain the same.

Essentially, azure shapes are changed to either orange or magenta depending on original row indices.
