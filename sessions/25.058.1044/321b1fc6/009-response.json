The transformation seems to involve a color substitution, specifically targeting connected regions of the same color.  The azure (8) regions are changing to either orange (7) or magenta (6). The choice between 7 and 6 appears to depend on the row of the azure region: top part is replaced by 7, bottom part by 6.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Bottom part of azure (8) is replaced by magenta color (6).\n3.  **Substitute:** Replace all pixels within each identified region with the new color that was determined in step 2.\n4.  **Output:** Produce the modified grid with the color substitutions.
