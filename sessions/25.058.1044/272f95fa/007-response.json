The `8` pixels form a vertical and horizontal line, intersecting at the center, and constant horizontal lines at rows 2 and 7.\n*   The output grid retains the `8` (azure) pixels from the input in the exact same positions.\n*   The output grid introduces new colors (`1`-blue, `2`-red, `3`-green, `4`-yellow, `6`-magenta) in the spaces between the azure lines.\n*   The new colors appear to fill the spaces to the left and right of the vertical azure line, in vertical columns between the crossing and edge constant azure lines.\n*    The new colors are consistently laid from up to down: `2`, `6`, `1` in output.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
