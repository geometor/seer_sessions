Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Azure Cross:** Locate the cross-shaped structure formed by connected azure (8) pixels.  The cross is defined by the longest horizontal and longest vertical lines of azure.
2.  **Retain Central Row:** The row that forms the horizontal line of the cross is maintained in the output.
3.  **Fill Above:** Fill the area *above* the central horizontal line with red (2), bounded by the azure pixels.
4.  **Fill Left Below:** Fill the area *below* the central horizontal line and to the *left* of the vertical azure line with magenta (6), bounded by azure.
5.  **Fill Top-Left, First Row (Yellow):** On the first row immediately below the central azure row, fill the area to the left of the vertical azure line with yellow (4), bounded on the left, top, and right by azure.
6.  **Fill Right Below:** Fill the area *below* the central horizontal line and to the *right* of the vertical azure line with green (3), bounded by azure.
7.  **Fill Bottom:** Fill the region at the very bottom row, bounded on the top by azure, with blue(1).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
