Okay, I'm ready to analyze this ARC-AGI task example. Here's my breakdown of the input-output pair, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program description.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (14x12).
*   The input grid primarily contains 0 (white), and 8 (azure).
* There appears to be a cross of azure (8) color.
*   The output grid introduces new colors: 2 (red), 4(yellow), 6 (magenta), 1 (blue), 3(green).
*   The azure (8) pixels in the input seem to act as a structural guide or boundary.
* The output colors fill regions that are bounded in some places by the azure cross.
* The central row containing all 8s in input is retained.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml

  - id: azure_cross

    color: azure (8)
    description: A cross-shaped structure formed by connected azure pixels.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Azure Cross:** Locate the cross-shaped structure formed by connected azure (8) pixels. This cross has a horizontal line and a vertical line. The central horizontal line is maintained.
2.  **Retain central row:** the row that consists of all azure(8) pixels is unchanged.
3. **Fill Above:** Fill the area *above* the central horizontal line of the azure cross and bounded on the left, right, and top by the azure pixels, with red (2).
4. **Fill Left Below, Top row:** Fill the top-left area *below* the horizontal central line and to the *left* of the vertical azure line using yellow (4). This region starts on first row below central row.
5.  **Fill Left Below, Rest:** Fill the remaining area *below* the horizontal central line and to the *left* of the vertical azure line with magenta (6).
6. **Fill Right Below:** Fill the area *below* the central horizontal line and to the *right* of the vertical azure line, with green (3).
7.  **Fill Bottom:** Fill the region at the bottom bounded by the lower arms of the azure cross with blue(1).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
