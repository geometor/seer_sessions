Both grids are 9x9. The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.  The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and orange (7). A new color, red (2) is introduced in the output.  The non-zero digits appear to be significant, forming objects.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The azure lines occupy the entire row and column of the initial azure pixel.\n\n3.  **Extend Orange:**  Create a horizontal and vertical line of orange (7) pixels, extending in all directions from the original orange pixel's position to the edges of the grid. The orange lines occupy the entire row and column of the initial orange pixel.\n\n4. **Place Red:** Determine the intersection point of the extended azure and orange lines. Place a red (2) pixel at this intersection point.\n\n5. **Output:** The output is grid combining all actions.\n"
