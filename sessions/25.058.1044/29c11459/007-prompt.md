Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all non-zero pixels in the input grid. Note their color (value) and initial positions.

2.  **Horizontal Expansion (Conditional):** If there are two non-zero pixels on the *same* row, and if those same colors appear expanded on that row in the output, they might be expanding.
    *   For each pair of objects of different colors on the *same row*: Determine if they expand horizontally towards each other in the output.
        *   If they do expand, determine the start and end positions of their expansion in the output.  Replicate this expansion in the predicted output.  There might be multiple on the same row expanding.
        *   If they *don't* expand, other transformation logic may be at play (see other rules).

3. **Row Replication (Conditional):** If the non zero values in a single row are replicated from their positions in the input, replicate the value across the output row between the positions.
    *   If this rule applies, consider that there might be a different transformation for other cases.

4.  **Other Cases**: If Rules 2 & 3 do not explain the change, look for additional or different transformations.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
