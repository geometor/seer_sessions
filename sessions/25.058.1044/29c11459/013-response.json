            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. The tests on the remaining training examples show that the code doesn't perfectly generalize. The main issues appear to be:\n\n1.  **Fill Color Logic:** The initial code hardcoded the fill color logic, setting output\\[row, midpoint] to a default value based on specific values in the input. It became clear, from testing, that there's a more flexible, pattern to apply.\n2.  **Pair Selection**: The `find_adjacent_pixel_pair` function seems to find *any* qualifying pair. The examples hint that we should only work on horizontal pairs that has a whitespace gap between them.\n\nThe strategy to resolve these issues is:\n\n1.  **Improve Fill Color Determination:** We need to make `get_fill_color` dynamic. The current, hard-coded method is not accurate for all cases. The new solution should determine the fill color based on the *output* example.\n2. **Refine Pair Selection Criteria.** Ensure that the selected pair has blank space between the colors.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis**\n\nTo better understand the patterns, I will analyze the input/output grids. Here are the metrics I'll focus on:\n\n*   Presence of a horizontal pair of different colored pixels.\n*   The gap between a pair.\n*   The fill color used in the output.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the examples and results, generated using print statements in a modified version of the `transform` function to collect needed details.\n\n```\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 3 0 0 1 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\nOutput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 3 3 2 1 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\nPixel A: (3, 1), Pixel B: (3, 4), Color A: 3, Color B: 1, Midpoint: 2, Fill Color: 2\nSUCCESS\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 3 0 0 7 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]\nOutput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 3 3 1 7 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]\nPixel A: (1, 2), Pixel B: (1, 5), Color A: 3, Color B: 7, Midpoint: 3, Fill Color: 1\nFAIL - Predicted fill color 5\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]\nOutput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 3 3 3 3 5 7 7 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]\nPixel A: (1, 1), Pixel B: (1, 7), Color A: 3, Color B: 7, Midpoint: 4, Fill Color: 5\nSUCCESS\n```\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_objects:\n        - description: \"Horizontal pair of pixels: blue (1) and green (3) with space between them\"\n          row: 3\n          start_col: 1\n          end_col: 4\n      output_objects:\n        - description: \"Green (3) expanded to the right, blue (1) expanded to the left, filled with red(2)\"\n          row: 3\n          fill_color: 2\n  - example_2:\n      input_objects:\n        - description: \"Horizontal pair of pixels: green (3) and orange (7) with space between them.\"\n          row: 1\n          start_col: 2\n          end_col: 5\n      output_objects:\n          - description: \"Green(3) extended to the right, Orange(7) extended to left, filled with blue(1)\"\n            row: 1\n            fill_color: 1\n  - example_3:\n       input_objects:\n         - description: \"Horizontal pair of pixels: green (3) and orange(7) with space between them\"\n           row: 1\n           start_col: 1\n           end_col: 7\n       output_objects:\n         - description: \"Green(3) expanded to right, Orange(7) extended to the left, filling the gap with grey(5)\"\n           row: 1\n           fill_color: 5\ngeneral:\n  - rule: \"Identify a horizontal pair of differently colored pixels separated by empty space.
