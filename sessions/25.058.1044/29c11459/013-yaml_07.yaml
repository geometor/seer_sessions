general:
  - rule: "Identify a horizontal pair of differently colored pixels separated by empty space. Extend the left pixel's color to the right and the right pixel's color to the left, meeting in the middle. Fill remaining single space between extended colors with a specific color."
  - fill_color_logic: "The fill color appears context dependent, drawn from the output, not a calculation from the inputs."
