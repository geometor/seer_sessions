Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to focus on expanding specific, non-zero colored pixels horizontally. A single gray pixel (value 5) consistently appears in the output between the expanded colored regions. The background (0, or white) remains unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D array (rows x columns)
      - cell_values: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - value: integer (color code)
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: color_block
    properties:
      - start_color: integer
      - end_color: integer
      - start_position: (row,col)
      - end_position:(row,col)
      

actions:
  - name: horizontal_expansion
    description: Replicating a pixel's color value horizontally.
    parameters:
      - color: integer (color code)
      - start_position: original pixel position.
      - end_position: where the expansion stops
      - expansion_length: int

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description:  Non-zero pixels in the input grid are horizontally expanded in the output grid.
  - type: constant
    description: a gray pixel is inserted between the expansion of the two non-zero pixels.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a non-zero value.
2. **Order Non-zero pixels:** Sort them from left to right based on their column index.
3.  **Determine Expansion Lengths:** From the examples it appears expansion extends to a length of 5 to each side, with the insertion point of '5' in the center.
4.  **Horizontal Expansion (Left):** For the leftmost non-zero pixel, replicate its color value horizontally to the left, 5 times.
5.  **Insert Separator:** Place the gray pixel (5) at the center.
6. **Horizontal Expansion (Right):** For the rightmost non-zero pixel, replicate its color value horizontally to the right, 5 times.
7.  **Retain Background:** All other pixels (value 0) in the input grid remain unchanged (value 0) in the output grid.

The core concept is creating two "blocks" of color extending, inserting a neutral gray in the middle.
