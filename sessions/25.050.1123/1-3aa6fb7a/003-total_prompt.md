Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5,4)]
      shape: "Two separate L shapes"
  background_color: 0

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5,4)]
      shape: "Two separate L shapes"
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,4)]
      shape: "single pixels inside the L shapes"
  background_color: 0
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct "L" shaped objects formed by the color 8 (azure).

2.  **Locate Insertion Points:** In both azure L shapes there is one pixel with color 0 bordered by two sides by azure pixels.

3. **Color Changing**: For each detected "L", a color 1 (blue) dot is placed in a location that is inside the L, one cell down and one cell to the right from the top-left pixel, and respectively, one cell up of the bottom-right pixel.

**Step-by-step transformation description**
The input azure L shapes are preserved. Two blue pixels are added inside the azure shapes.

```python
"""
The input azure L shapes are preserved. Two blue pixels are added inside the azure shapes,
one cell down and one cell to the right from the top-left pixel of the "L" shape, 
and respectively, one cell up of the bottom-right pixel.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
