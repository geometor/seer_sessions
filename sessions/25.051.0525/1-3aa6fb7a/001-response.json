These objects are 2x1 rectangles. One is located at the top-left corner (1, 1), and the second at position (3,4).\n\n2.  **Detect Changes**: Comparing the input and output, we can see that a color 1 (blue) cell has been added to the right of the top rectangle (at [1,2]). We can see that the other color 1 (blue) cell is added to the left of the bottom rectangle (at [4,4]).\n\n3. **Transformation Rule:**\n    -   For the top azure rectangle, add a blue cell to the immediate right of the rectangle.\n    -   For the bottom azure rectangle, add a blue cell to the immediate left of the rectangle.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe program identifies each 2x1 azure rectangle. For the topmost rectangle, add a blue cell to the immediate right. For the bottommost rectangle, add a blue cell to the immediate left.\n"
