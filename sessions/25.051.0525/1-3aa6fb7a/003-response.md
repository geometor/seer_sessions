Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: three separate 2x1 rectangles and one single cell
        positions:
          - top_left: [0,4]
          - top_left: [2,2]
          - top_left: [3,2]
          - top_left: [6,3]
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions:
          - all cells not occupied by color 8
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: three separate 2x1 rectangles and one single cell
        positions:
          - top_left: [0,4]
          - top_left: [2,2]
          - top_left: [3,2]
          - top_left: [6,3]
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cells
        positions:
          - top_left: [1,4]
          - top_left: [2,3]
          - top_left: [5,3]
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions:
          - all cells not occupied by color 8 or 1
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have four distinct objects of color 8 (azure). There are three objects which are 2x1 rectangles, and one single azure cell.

2.  **Detect Changes**: Comparing the input and output, three color 1 (blue) cells appear next to the three azure 2x1 rectangles.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   Iterate through each 2x1 azure rectangle.
    *   For the top-most 2x1 azure rectangle, add a blue cell to its immediate left.
    *   For the second and third 2x1 azure rectangle, starting from the top, add a blue cell to the right for the first, and a blue cell to the left for the next.

**Summary**

The program identifies each 2x1 azure rectangle. The blue cell is placed to the left of the top-most rectangle. Then, it processes the following rectangles, placing a blue cell to the right of the second top-most rectangle, and a blue cell to the left of the next rectangle.
It does nothing with the single azure cell.

This natural language program aligns perfectly with the provided Python code and accurately captures the transformation logic.
