These serve as reference points. Note there may be more than one of each.\n\n2.  **Yellow Replication:** For each red cell, place two yellow (color 4) cells two rows above. These cells are horizontally spaced two cells apart, with one vertically aligned with the red cell and the other two cells to its right. Repeat one row above the red cell.\n\n3.  **Orange Extension:** For each blue pixel, extend it with orange color 7. Specifically, in the output, we place an orange cell to the left, to the right and below each blue cell.\n\n4. **Azure cell** The azure cell remains in place, untouched.\n\n**Complete Description**\n\nThe transformation uses each red and blue cell in the input as anchor points to create new colored cells in the output. Yellow cells are placed relative to each red cell, and orange cells cluster around each blue cell. The positions of the original red, azure, and blue cells are unchanged.\n"
