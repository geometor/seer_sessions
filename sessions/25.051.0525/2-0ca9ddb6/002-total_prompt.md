Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
  background_color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      position: (2, 2), (2,4)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      position: (4, 2), (4,4)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 7 (orange)
      position: (5,6),(6,6),(6,7),(7,6)
      shape: single cells
  background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Key Positions:** Locate the positions of the red (color 2) and blue (color 1) cells in the input grid. These serve as reference points.

2.  **Yellow Replication:** Two rows above the red cell, place two yellow (color 4) cells. These cells are horizontally spaced two cells apart, with one vertically aligned with the red cell and the other two cells to its right in the example provided.
   Two rows above *that*, place two yellow (color 4) cells, with the same relative postions to each other.

3. **Orange Extension:** The blue pixel is extended with orange. The single blue cell (color 1) transforms into a cluster of orange (color 7) cells. Specifically, in the output, we place an orange cell to the left, to the right and below the blue cell.

**Complete Description**

The transformation involves using the red and blue cells in the input as anchor points to create new colored cells in the output. Yellow cells are placed relative to the red cell, and orange cells cluster around the blue cell, replacing the single blue cell. The positions of the original red and blue are unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
