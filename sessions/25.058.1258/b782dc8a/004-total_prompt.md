Okay, I'm ready to analyze this ARC-AGI task example. Here's my report on the input-output pair, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output grids are the same size (11 x 24).
*   The primary colors involved are azure (8), green (3), red (2), and white(0).
*   The input grid seems to have a "noisy" distribution of azure pixels, with a small cluster of green, red and white pixels near the center-right.
*    The output maintains a similar structure (azure all around) but "inserts" green and red in an alternating horizontal and verticle pattern around where a non azure pixel is.
*   It appears some kind of "fill", "expansion", or "alternating insertion" operation is applied to the non-azure pixels.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: 11x24
      colors: [8, 0, 3, 2]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: 11x24
      colors: [8, 0, 3, 2]
  - object: azure_pixels
    color: 8
    property: dominant_background
  - object: insertion_pixels
    colors: [3, 2]
    property: inserted_alternating
  - relationship: size_preservation
    type: equality
    between: [input_grid, output_grid]
  - action: insertion
    type: fill
    parameters:
      colors: [3,2]
      pattern: alternating
      condition: non_azure_neighbors
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  Check if the current pixel is NOT azure (8).
3. If not azure (8) examine the four neighbor pixels (up, down, left, right)
4.  Iterate over the four neighbors.
5. If any neighbor is azure (8) then:
   - Change the neighboring azure (8) pixel to green(3) if the last non-azure pixel was not green
   - Change the neighboring azure(8) pixel to red(2) if the last non-azure pixel was not red
   - Reset the 'last non-azure pixel' at each non-azure pixel, start with the last non azure was red.

Essentially, for every non-azure pixel, the program checks the adjacent pixels. The adjacent azure pixels are replaced in an alternating horizontal and vertical pattern of red and green.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
