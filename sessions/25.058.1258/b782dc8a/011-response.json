            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the derived code focused on identifying a central \"island\" of azure, blue, and yellow pixels, then performing a mirrored color swap within that island. While this worked for the first example, it fails to generalize correctly to the other training examples. The main issues appear to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Island Identification**: The `find_island` function, designed to find a contiguous region of azure surrounding blue and yellow, isn't working reliably. Sometimes it captures too little or too much.\n2. **Strict mirroring:** It appears that transformation does perform a mirroring on each individual axis.\n3. **Overly Specific Color Mapping:** The initial color swapping rules are too specific (yellow becomes azure, blue becomes yellow, azure becomes blue). The actual color transformations seem to be based on a mirroring relative to the boundaries, not a fixed color map.\n\nThe strategy to address these errors will involve:\n\n1.  **Revising Island Definition:** Instead of focusing on a contiguous azure region *surrounding* the colors, reframe the \"island\" concept. The key appears to be mirroring on different axis.\n2.  **Generalized Mirroring Logic**: Remove any color based logic in favor of performing mirroring around each of the axis\n3.  **Iterative Refinement**: Test the revised program after each change on all training examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo get precise data, let's use `code_execution` to examine the grids and the results.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_island(grid, core_colors):\n    \"\"\"Finds the contiguous azure region around the core colors.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n    island_pixels = []\n\n    # Find a starting pixel of a core color\n    start_row, start_col = -1, -1\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] in core_colors:\n                start_row, start_col = r, c\n                break\n        if start_row != -1:\n            break\n\n    if start_row == -1:\n        return []\n\n    # Explore the connected region using DFS\n    stack = [(start_row, start_col)]\n    while stack:\n        r, c = stack.pop()\n        if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols and not visited[r, c]:\n            visited[r, c] = True\n            if grid[r, c] == 8 or grid[r,c] in core_colors :  # Include azure and core colors\n                island_pixels.append((r, c))\n                # Add neighbors to the stack\n                for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                    stack.append((r + dr, c + dc))\n\n    return island_pixels\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the mirroring and color replacement rules.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # 1.

If an azure, blue, or yellow pixel with the coordinate(`r`,`mirror_c`) is within the defined region, replace the color of pixel (`r`,`c`) with the mirrored color.\n    *   For pixels to the right of the maximum yellow column: find the `mirror_c` by calculating `mirror_c =  max_yellow_col - (c - max_yellow_col) + 1`. If an azure, blue, or yellow pixel with the coordinate(`r`,`mirror_c`) is within the defined region, replace the color of pixel (`r`,`c`) with the mirrored color.\n\n3.  **Vertical Mirroring:**\n   * Find the minimum and maximum row of the blue pixels\n   * Within the identified region, and above the minimum and below the maximum, mirror the colors.\n   * For pixels above the minimum blue row, find the `mirror_r` by calculating `mirror_r = min_blue_row + (min_blue_row - r) - 1`. If an azure, blue, or yellow pixel with coordinate (`mirror_r`,`c`) is in a region, replace the color of pixel (`r`,`c`) with the mirrored color.\n   * For pixels below the maximum blue row, find the `mirror_r` by calculating `mirror_r = max_blue_row - (r - max_blue_row) + 1`. If an azure, blue, or yellow pixel with coordinate (`mirror_r`,`c`) is in a region, replace the color of pixel (`r`,`c`) with the mirrored color.\n\n4.  **Color Preservation:** Any pixels not within the mirrored region, or not of color azure, blue, or yellow within the mirrored region, retain their original color from the input grid.\n\nThe next step is to translate the revised natural language to a new python function\n"
