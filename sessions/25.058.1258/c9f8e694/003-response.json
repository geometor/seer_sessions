The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), blue (1), red (2), and gray (5). The transformation seems to involve replacing the gray (5) pixels with the color of the pixel to the immediate left. There appears to be a propagation of color replacement, or it is conditional based on the left neighbor.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
