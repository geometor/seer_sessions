Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements**

*   **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 12x12 grids.
*   **Colors:** The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), green (3), yellow (4), and gray (5). The output grid retains white, green, and yellow, but all gray pixels are replaced by the color of the non-gray pixel that initiated the gray area.
*   **Shapes:** There are distinct regions or "blobs" of connected pixels of the same color. Gray areas seem to be bounded or "seeded" by other colors.
* **Boundaries**: gray areas extend until a change to white or another color

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [12, 12]
    elements: pixels
    properties:
        - color

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [white, green, yellow, gray]
      location: [row, column]

  - type: region
    properties:
      color: [white, green, yellow, gray]
      pixels: list_of_pixel_locations

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    input: [region, color]
    output: region
    description: Replaces the color of all pixels in a region with a new color.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [pixel, pixel]
    properties:
      direction: [horizontal, vertical, diagonal]

  - type: containment
    between: [region, pixel]

  - type: boundary
    between: [region, region]

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Scan the input grid and identify contiguous regions of pixels with the same color. A region is defined as a group of horizontally or vertically (not diagonally) adjacent pixels of the same color.

2.  **Gray Region Processing:** For each region of gray (5) pixels:
    *   Find the non-gray color that initiated the gray region. Looking at the example, it is the value that is immediately up, down, left, or right of the gray region that is not '0'.
    *   Replace all gray (5) pixels within that identified region with the identified non-gray color.

3.  **Other Colors:** Regions of white (0), green (3), and yellow (4) remain unchanged.

4.  **Output:** The output grid is the result of the above replacements.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
