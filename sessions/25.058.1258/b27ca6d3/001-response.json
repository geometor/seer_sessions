The white (0) pixels serve as a background and don't seem to directly participate in the transformation. The output grids are mostly identical to the input grids, with changes related to where red pixels are located. Green pixels are introduced adjacent to red pixels in specific configurations.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
