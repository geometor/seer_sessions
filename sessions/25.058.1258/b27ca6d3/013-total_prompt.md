Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value '2' (red).

2.  **Check Horizontal/Vertical Adjacency:** For each target pixel (red pixel):
    *   Check for three or more horizontally or vertically adjacent red pixels.
    *   If found, change *all* connected red pixels in that group to '3' (green).

3.  **Check Diagonal Adjacency for Isolated Pairs:**
    * Iterate through all of the `red` pixels
    * If there exists two red_pixels, that are diagonally adjacent and they each are not adjacent to a third red pixel that is horizontally or vertically aligned with both, change the color of the upper-right red_pixel to be green.

4. **Leave Unchanged:** Red pixels not matching the above cases stay red.  Non-red pixels are unchanged.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
