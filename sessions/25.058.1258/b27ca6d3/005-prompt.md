Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **For each** red (2) pixel:
    *   **Check** the directly adjacent pixels (up, down, left, and right - not diagonal).
    * Specifically find the group of 3 pixels: the top, middle, and bottom of the row, or the left, middle, and right of the column.
    * If a horizontal or vertical group of three such cells all exist, **change** the color of adjacent white (0) pixels to green (3) *within that set of 3*.
3.  **Leave** all other pixels unchanged.
4. Green pixels are only added on the first and third cells in the existing group, that is, it looks like an adjacent 'frame' must exist for green to be filled.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
