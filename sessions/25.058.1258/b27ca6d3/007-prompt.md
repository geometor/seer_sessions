Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all red (2) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **For each** red pixel:
    *   **Check for horizontal sequences:** If there's a white (0) pixel directly to the left AND a white (0) pixel directly to the right of the red pixel, forming a `white-red-white` sequence, change the color of *both* white pixels to green (3).
    *   **Check for vertical sequences:** If there's a white (0) pixel directly above AND a white (0) pixel directly below the red pixel, forming a `white-red-white` sequence, change the color of *both* white pixels to green (3).
3.  **All other pixels remain unchanged.** The transformation only affects white pixels that are part of a `white-red-white` sequence centered on a red pixel.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
