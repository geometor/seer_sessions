Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value '2' (red).

2.  **Check Adjacency:** For each target pixel (red pixel):
    *   Iterate through its eight neighboring pixels (including diagonals).

3.  **Conditional Transformation:** If ANY of the following is true, change color from `red` to `green`:
    *    There exist three or more horizontally or vertically adjacent red(2) pixels.
    *	  Place a green(3) pixel to the upper right of any set of two diagonally adjacent red pixels.

4.  **Leave Unchanged:** Any red pixel not meeting the adjacency condition remains red. All non-red pixels remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
