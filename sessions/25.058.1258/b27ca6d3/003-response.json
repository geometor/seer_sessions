The transformation seems to involve adding green (3) pixels around some of the red (2) pixels. The positioning of the green pixels appears to be directly adjacent to the red pixels, forming a sort of \"halo\" or \"border\" in certain locations. It is important to see how consistent the placement rule is.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Green pixels are only added on the first and third cells in the existing group, that is, it looks like an adjacent 'frame' must exist for green to be filled.\n\nEssentially, a three element frame must exist around red pixels, where there is an adjacent cell on *both* sides, before the border of green pixels are added. The core idea appears to be the creation of a partial green border, but only where the local shape of the border allows it.\n"
