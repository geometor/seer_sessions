            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code correctly identify the core concept: changing white pixels to green based on their proximity to red pixels. However, the original description and code only considered *immediate* horizontal and vertical neighbors. The additional training examples reveal that the rule is slightly more nuanced, specifically regarding the extent and directionality of these checks, and that it only applies to white pixels next to red pixels. The provided examples demonstrate perfect matching, which simplifies matters by removing ambiguities.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I will meticulously examine each input/output pair, and include an automated set of properties of the objects and relationships within each example. This involves programmatically checking for sequence lengths, directions, and any skipped pixels.\n\n2.  **Refine Observations:** Based on the detailed analysis, I will update the `YAML` block with more precise observations, paying close attention to edge cases and exceptions.\n\n3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** I'll rewrite the natural language program to accurately and completely capture the transformation rule, incorporating the new insights. The program will be deterministic and leave no room for misinterpretation.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nHere, I provide a text description and a YAML block to catalog important object and transformation data.\n\n```yaml\ntask: 0bda4c78\nexamples:\n  - example_index: 0\n    input_grid_shape: [5, 5]\n    output_grid_shape: [5, 5]\n    input_objects:\n        red_pixel_count: 1\n        white_pixel_count: 16\n        other_pixel_count: 8\n    output_objects:\n        red_pixel_count: 1\n        white_pixel_count: 12\n        green_pixel_count: 4\n        other_pixel_count: 8\n    transformations:\n      - description: \"White pixels adjacent to a red pixel, horizontally or vertically, become green.\"\n        affected_pixels: 4\n        unaffected_pixels: 21\n        direction: \"Both\"  # Horizontal and Vertical\n        sequence_length: 3 #white red white\n\n  - example_index: 1\n    input_grid_shape: [5, 3]\n    output_grid_shape: [5, 3]\n    input_objects:\n        red_pixel_count: 1\n        white_pixel_count: 12\n        other_pixel_count: 2\n    output_objects:\n        red_pixel_count: 1\n        white_pixel_count: 8\n        green_pixel_count: 4\n        other_pixel_count: 2\n    transformations:\n      - description: \"White pixels adjacent to a red pixel, horizontally or vertically, become green.\"\n        affected_pixels: 4\n        unaffected_pixels: 11\n        direction: \"Both\"\n        sequence_length: 3\n\n  - example_index: 2\n    input_grid_shape: [5, 5]\n    output_grid_shape: [5, 5]\n    input_objects:\n      red_pixel_count: 1\n      white_pixel_count: 20\n      other_pixel_count: 4\n    output_objects:\n      red_pixel_count: 1\n      white_pixel_count: 16\n      green_pixel_count: 4\n      other_pixel_count: 4\n    transformations:\n      - description: \"White pixels adjacent to a red pixel, horizontally or vertically, become green.\"\n        affected_pixels: 4\n        unaffected_pixels: 21\n        direction: \"Both\"\n        sequence_length: 3\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify** all red (2) pixels within the input grid.\n2.  **For each** red pixel:\n    *   **Check for adjacent white pixels:** If there's a white (0) pixel directly to the left, change it to green (3).\n    *   **Check for adjacent white pixels:** If there's a white (0) pixel directly to the right, change it to green (3).\n    *   **Check for adjacent white pixels:** If there's a white (0) pixel directly above, change it to green (3).\n    *   **Check for adjacent white pixels:** If there's a white (0) pixel directly below, change it to green (3).\n3.  **All other pixels remain unchanged.** The transformation only affects white pixels that are immediately adjacent to a red pixel.\n"
