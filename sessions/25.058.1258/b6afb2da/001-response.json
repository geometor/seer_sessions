The outlining appears to replace the outer layer of the original filled rectangle. The fill color (interior) of the outlined rectangle is red (color 2), the four corners are blue (color 1) and the edges excluding the corners are yellow (color 4). The background is white (color 0).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
