The input grid appears to transform into the output grid by replicating a section of itself. The colors and their spatial relationships seem crucial. The replication is not a simple copy of the entire input; a specific region is selected and repeated.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The original content of rows 11 and below is completely overwritten by this pasted region.\n\nIn essence, the transformation duplicates the top section (rows 0-8) of the input grid and places it below row 10 (a line full of '4').
