This line is consistently present in the same row index in both input and output.\n2.  **Isolate Non-Yellow Pixels Above the Line:** Consider all pixels above the yellow line in the input grid. Exclude any pixels that are yellow (4).\n3. **Duplicate and position below the yellow line:** Copy non-yellow pixels from the input grid and position the duplicate below the yellow line in the output grid.\n4. **Maintain position relative to x axes**: The position relative to the x axes should be the same in the output grid as the input grid.\n5. **Preserve Remainder of Grid**: all the pixels in the input, should exist in the output.\n\nIn essence, the transformation duplicates the non-yellow pixels from the top section of the grid (above the yellow line) to the bottom section (below the yellow line), maintaining their respective column positions, while keeping the yellow line in place.\n"
