Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Landmark Row:** Find the row index where all pixels are yellow (color value 4).
2.  **Define Source Region:** The source region starts from the top of the grid (row 0) and extends up to, but does not include, the landmark row.
3. **Define Destination Region:** The destination region starts two rows *below* the landmark row.
4.  **Copy and Paste:** Copy the entire source region. Paste this copied region into the destination region.
5. **Clear Remaining Rows**: Set all rows below pasted region to black (0).
6. **Handle Edge Cases**: If the landmark row does not exists or destination goes beyond bounds, return the original input.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying a "landmark" row of yellow pixels, copying the region above it, and pasting it two rows below the landmark. The code seems to implement this logic correctly. However, the results on the other examples show inconsistencies. This indicates that the transformation rule is more complex or different than initially hypothesized.

My strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair and the code's output. Determine if the landmark rule applies, and if not, what alternative rule might be in play. I'll pay close attention to cases where the code's output differs from the expected output.
2.  **Identify Errors:** Categorize the errors. Are they due to incorrect landmark identification, incorrect copy/paste logic, issues with boundary conditions, or a completely different transformation rule?
3.  **Refine the Program:** Based on error analysis, I'll incrementally refine the natural language program. If necessary, I will abandon the initial "landmark" concept and develop a new one.
4. **Facts:** Create a detailed YAML document summarizing the findings, specifically noting observations related to "objectness", copying, and positioning operations.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution when needed)**

Here's an analysis of each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (6, 5)
    *   Landmark Row Index: 3
    *   Expected Output Shape: (6, 5)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (6, 5)
    *   Correct: True.
    *   Observation: original case, correctly transformed

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (7, 5)
    *   Landmark Row Index: 4
    *   Expected Output Shape: (7, 5)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (7, 5)
    *   Correct: True.
    *   Observation: transform occurred, image above landmark moved down 2 rows

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (9, 8)
    *   Landmark Row Index: None.
    *   Expected Output Shape: (9,8)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (9, 8)
    *   Correct: True
    *   Observation: No yellow row. The function correctly handles the edge case and return the original.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input Shape: (15, 7)
    *   Landmark Row Index: 10
    *   Expected Output Shape: (15, 7)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (15, 7)
    *   Correct: False
    *   Observation: The code correctly identified the landmark row and copied the region above, but the copy should include the 2 green lines below landmark, not just above it.

* **Example 5:**
   *   Input Shape: (18, 8)
    *   Landmark Row: 7
    *   Expected Output Shape: (18, 8)
    *   Actual Output: (18, 8)
    *   Correct: False.
    *   Observation: Like example 4, it appears the landmark rule applies, and the source region is incorrect. The source needs to include 2 rows under the landmark.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
examples:
  - id: example_1
    landmark_present: true
    landmark_color: yellow
    source_region_includes: "rows above landmark"
    copy_offset: 2 # Rows below landmark
    correct: true
  - id: example_2
    landmark_present: true
    landmark_color: yellow
    source_region_includes: "rows above landmark"
    copy_offset: 2
    correct: true
  - id: example_3
    landmark_present: false
    landmark_color: yellow
    source_region_includes: "N/A"
    copy_offset: N/A
    correct: true
  - id: example_4
    landmark_present: true
    landmark_color: yellow
    source_region_includes: "rows above AND 2 rows below landmark"
    copy_offset: 2
    correct: false
 - id: example_5
    landmark_present: true
    landmark_color: yellow
    source_region_includes: "rows above AND 2 rows below landmark"
    copy_offset: 2
    correct: false
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Landmark Row:** Find the row index where all pixels are yellow (color value 4). If no such row exists, return original grid.
2.  **Define Source Region:**
    *   The source region *starts* at the top of the grid (row 0).
    *   The source region *ends* two rows *below* the landmark row.
3.  **Define Destination Region:** The destination region starts two rows *below* the landmark row.
4.  **Copy and Paste:** Copy the entire source region. Paste this copied region into the destination region, starting at the destination start row.
5. **Clear Remaining Rows:** Set all rows after the pasted region to black (0).
6. **Handle Edge Cases:**
    *   If no landmark is found, return the original input.
    *   If copying goes out of output grid bounds, return the original input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
