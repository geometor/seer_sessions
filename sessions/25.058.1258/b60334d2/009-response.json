Most cells are '0' (white). There are a few '5' (gray) pixels scattered seemingly randomly.\n*   **Output:** A 9x9 grid. It retains some '0' (white) pixels, introduces '1' (blue) pixels, and repositions/replicates the '5' (gray) pixels. The arrangement of 5s and 1s appears more structured than the input's 5s. There's a noticeable checkerboard-like pattern in the upper-left portion.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"

The process resembles tiling with some constraint when the base title cannot fully fill the whole output.\n"
