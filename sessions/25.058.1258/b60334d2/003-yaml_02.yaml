objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 5
        color: gray
      - value: 1
        color: blue

actions:
  - name: identify_gray_pixels
    input: input_grid
    description: Locate all pixels with a value of 5.

  - name: create_cross
    input: gray_pixel_location
    description: Generate a cross-shaped pattern of blue pixels (value 1) centered on the gray pixel location. The cross extends one pixel in each cardinal direction (up, down, left, right) from the central gray pixel, but only if within the grid bounds, replacing what would otherwise be 0's.

  - name: combine
    input: gray_pixels, blue_crosses, empty_grid
    description: Place the original gray and new blue pixels onto the initial grid, keeping any 0's that do not interact with a '5'.

relationships:
  - adjacency: Blue pixels are placed adjacent to gray pixels.
  - centrality:  The gray pixel is the center of the cross formed by blue pixels.
  - containment: All pixels are contained within the 9x9 grid.
