Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Iterate through each pixel in the input grid. The pixels of interest are those with the value 8 (azure).

2.  **Recolor Target Pixels:**
    a. If the azure pixel is in the top right corner area (defined, in this case, by rows 1-3 and colums 7-9 inclusive), change the color to 2 (red)
    b. If the azure pixel is not in that top right corner area, change the color of the azure pixel to 1 (blue).

3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (those not azure) retain their original color/value.

4.  **Output:** The resulting grid, with recolored pixels, becomes the output.

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the specified rules."""

    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)  # Initialize output grid
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Iterate through each pixel
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Recolor azure pixels based on location
            if output_grid[i, j] == 8:
                if 1 <= i <= 3 and 7 <= j <= 9:
                     output_grid[i,j] = 2
                else:
                    output_grid[i, j] = 1

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example only, and as expected, it doesn't correctly handle all other cases. The core idea of recoloring azure pixels based on their location is partially correct, but the conditions for determining *which* color to apply are not universally valid. The initial program assumed a static top-right corner as the region for recoloring to red, and everything else to blue. The additional examples reveal a more dynamic relationship. We need to identify what distinguishes the azure pixels that turn red from those that turn blue, across *all* training examples.

My strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, focusing on the azure pixels.
2.  **Identify the Determining Factor:** Determine the rule that dictates whether an azure pixel becomes red or blue. It's likely related to spatial relationships or proximity to other colors/objects, not just absolute position.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect the discovered rule, generalizing across all training examples.
4.  **Prepare for Code Modification:** The YAML and refined program will guide the changes needed in the Python code.

**Example Metrics and Results**

I will use a structured approach to examine each example pair to create an observation report and validate my assumptions as I progress.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
