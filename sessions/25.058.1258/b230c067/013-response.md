Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are 10x10 grids.
*   The input grid contains a shape made of azure (8) pixels against a background of white (0) pixels.
*   The output grid seems to replicate the shape of the input, but with blue (1) pixels in place of azure and a new element: some of the surrounding white is replaced with red. These red pixels are only in the top right of the azure shape.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    property: static

  - id: shape_1
    color: azure (8)
    property: contiguous
    relation: occupies_input

  - id: shape_2
    color: blue(1)
    property: contiguous
    relation: occupies_most_output

  - id: shape_3
    color: red(2)
    property: contiguous
    relation: occupies_part_output

actions:
  - subject: shape_1
    type: color_change
    new_color: blue (1)
    result: shape_2

  - subject: background
    type: partial_color_change_near_shape
    area: top_right_quadrant_of_shape
    color: red(2)

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Shape:** Locate the contiguous block of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Recolor the shape blue:** Change all the azure (8) pixels of the shape to blue (1). Copy this shape to the output grid.
3.  **Outline:** Find the "outline" of the shape - cells where the shape touches the background, focus on the outline cells in the top and right of the original shape.
4.  **Change color on top and right to red:** Change to red (2) the color of the white (0) pixels that touch the top and right part of the changed shape.
