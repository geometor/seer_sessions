Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on discerning the transformation logic and expressing it as a natural language program.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming input grids containing azure (8) pixels into output grids with blue (1) and red (2) pixels. The white (0) background remains unchanged. The azure shapes are replaced, but the overall shape *structure* is preserved. It appears that azure regions are converted into either blue or red, based, likely, on their spatial configuration.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: background
    color: white (0)
    property: static, unchanged

  - name: shape_group_1
    color: azure (8)
    property: contiguous, replaced, becomes blue

  - name: shape_group_2
    color: azure(8)
    property: contiguous, replaced, becomes red
    

actions:
  - name: replace
    agent: transformation_rule
    target: shape_group_1,shape_group_2
    result: change color to blue or red

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: shapes are replaced based on their relative position
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Replacement Color, first group:** If a region in the top right corner is azure, replace the connected pixels with red (2)
3. **Determine Replacement Color, second group:** replace all other azure pixels with blue (1).
4. **Preserve Background:** Keep all white (0) pixels unchanged.

Essentially, the transformation replaces azure with either blue or red based on the identified groups in each example.
