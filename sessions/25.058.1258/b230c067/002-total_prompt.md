**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming input grids containing azure (8) pixels into output grids with blue (1) and red (2) pixels. The white (0) background remains unchanged. The azure shapes are replaced, but the overall shape *structure* is preserved. It appears that azure regions are converted into either blue or red, based, likely, on their spatial configuration.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: background
    color: white (0)
    property: static, unchanged

  - name: shape_group_1
    color: azure (8)
    property: contiguous, replaced, becomes blue

  - name: shape_group_2
    color: azure(8)
    property: contiguous, replaced, becomes red
    

actions:
  - name: replace
    agent: transformation_rule
    target: shape_group_1,shape_group_2
    result: change color to blue or red

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: shapes are replaced based on their relative position
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Replacement Color, first group:** If a region in the top right corner is azure, replace the connected pixels with red (2)
3. **Determine Replacement Color, second group:** replace all other azure pixels with blue (1).
4. **Preserve Background:** Keep all white (0) pixels unchanged.

Essentially, the transformation replaces azure with either blue or red based on the identified groups in each example.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
