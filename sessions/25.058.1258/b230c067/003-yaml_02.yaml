facts:
  - description: |
      The input grids contain azure (8) and white (0) pixels.
  - description: |
      Azure pixels form contiguous regions (objects).
  - description: |
      White pixels are unchanged (background).
  - description: |
      Azure regions are replaced by either red (2) or blue (1) pixels.
  - rule: |
      The color replacement appears to use these rules: If the contiguous
      azure region has any pixels in the last 3 rows AND last 3 columns, the
      region is replaced with red (2). All other regions
      are replaced with blue(1).
