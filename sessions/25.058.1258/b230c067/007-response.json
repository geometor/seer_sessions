The primary colors involved in this specific example are white (0), azure (8), blue (1) and red (2). The transformation seems to involve a change in color based on the original color, rather than the positions. Specifically, azure (8) is getting recolored. It will be interesting to observe how that recoloring is occuring: to either blue (1) or red (2).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

If the azure pixel is in the top right corner area (defined, in this case, by rows 1-3 and colums 7-9 inclusive), change the color to 2 (red)\n    b.
