Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved replacing azure regions with either red or blue based on their proximity to the top-right corner. This rule, however, doesn't generalize perfectly to all the training examples. Specifically, the corner-based color determination is not accurate in every case.

The strategy to resolve this is to:

1.  **Analyze All Examples:** Examine all input/output pairs, not just the first one, to identify the *true* underlying rule.
2.  **Refine Region Identification:** The `find_contiguous_regions` function seems correct and can be reused.
3.  **Improve Color Determination:** The logic for determining whether to use red or blue needs adjustment. It's not solely based on the corner, but more complex logic.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the adjusted code and program against *all* examples after each change, and modify again if errors persist.

**Example and Results Analysis**

To understand the rule better, let's analyze some details about each example. The most crucial aspect is the rule that defines the replacement color.

Here is a breakdown of the training data that illustrates this:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Azure regions correctly identified.
    *   Replacement color rule (corner proximity) *works* in this case, making the upper right region red, others blue.

*   **Example 2:**

    *   Azure regions correctly identified.
    *   Replacement color rule (corner proximity) *works*. The larger azure region is along the bottom, triggering red.

*   **Example 3:**

    *   Azure regions correctly identified.
    *   Replacement color rule (corner proximity) *works*. The larger azure region is along the bottom and right, triggering red.

From this analysis, we notice that the rule for the azure replacement isn't exactly the top right, but the bottom right, and even more precice: if any part of an azure colored object exists in the last three rows and last three columns, the replacement color is red (color 2), else it is blue (color 1).

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
facts:
  - description: |
      The input grids contain azure (8) and white (0) pixels.
  - description: |
      Azure pixels form contiguous regions (objects).
  - description: |
      White pixels are unchanged (background).
  - description: |
      Azure regions are replaced by either red (2) or blue (1) pixels.
  - rule: |
      The color replacement appears to use these rules: If the contiguous
      azure region has any pixels in the last 3 rows AND last 3 columns, the
      region is replaced with red (2). All other regions
      are replaced with blue(1).
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.  A contiguous region is a group of connected pixels of the same color, where connectivity is defined by the 4 cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

2.  **Determine Replacement Color:** For each identified azure region, determine the replacement color based on these rules:

    *   **Red (2):** If the region contains ANY pixels existing in the last 3
        rows AND last 3 columns, the replacement color is red.
    *   **Blue (1):** All other azure regions are replaced with blue.

3.  **Apply Replacement:** Replace the azure pixels in each region with their determined replacement color.

4.  **Preserve Background:** Keep all white (0) pixels unchanged (they are the background and do not participate in the transformation).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
