The output grids retain the same orange (7) background pixels in their original positions. The key transformation involves the gray (6) objects. Each contiguous block of gray pixels in the input is identified as a single object. In the output, each of these objects is replaced by a block of the exact same shape and size, but filled with a new color. The specific color used for replacement depends on the properties (size, shape, bounding box) of the original gray object. Different gray objects can map to different colors.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
