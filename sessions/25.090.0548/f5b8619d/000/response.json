Other white pixels remain white.\n5.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation of white pixels to azure seems dependent on their position relative to the non-white pixels in the *original* input grid. A white pixel at position (r, c) becomes azure (8) if *either* row 'r' *or* column 'c' of the input grid contains at least one non-white pixel. If both the row and column containing the white pixel are entirely white in the input, the pixel remains white (0) in the base tile.\n6.  **Tiling:** Once the base tile is generated according to rules 3-5, the final output is created by repeating this base tile in a 2x2 arrangement.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Create a new intermediate grid, `base_tile`, of the same dimensions (H x W).\n3.  Find all rows in the input grid that contain at least one non-white pixel. Store their indices in a set called `rows_with_non_white`.\n4.  Find all columns in the input grid that contain at least one non-white pixel. Store their indices in a set called `cols_with_non_white`.\n5.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid at row `r` (from 0 to H-1) and column `c` (from 0 to W-1):\n    a.  Let `input_color` be the color of the input grid cell at (r, c).\n    b.  If `input_color` is not white (0), set the cell `base_tile[r, c]` to `input_color`.\n    c.  If `input_color` is white (0):\n        i.  Check if `r` is in `rows_with_non_white` OR if `c` is in `cols_with_non_white`.\n        ii. If the check is true, set `base_tile[r, c]` to azure (8).\n        iii. If the check is false, set `base_tile[r, c]` to white (0).\n6.
