Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input is always a 6x6 grid. It contains a single 2x2 block of non-white pixels. The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels. The position of this 2x2 block varies, but it seems to be somewhat centered, not touching the absolute edges. The four pixels within the 2x2 block have different colors.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output is also a 6x6 grid. It retains the original 2x2 block from the input in its exact position and with its original colors. Additionally, the four 2x2 corners of the output grid are filled with solid colors. The top-left corner (rows 0-1, cols 0-1), top-right corner (rows 0-1, cols 4-5), bottom-left corner (rows 4-5, cols 0-1), and bottom-right corner (rows 4-5, cols 4-5) are each filled with a single color, creating four 2x2 monochromatic blocks.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves mapping the colors from the input's 2x2 block to the output's corner 2x2 blocks.
    *   The color of the **top-left** pixel in the input's 2x2 block determines the color of the **bottom-right** corner block in the output.
    *   The color of the **top-right** pixel in the input's 2x2 block determines the color of the **bottom-left** corner block in the output.
    *   The color of the **bottom-left** pixel in the input's 2x2 block determines the color of the **top-right** corner block in the output.
    *   The color of the **bottom-right** pixel in the input's 2x2 block determines the color of the **top-left** corner block in the output.
    This mapping corresponds to a 180-degree rotation or a reflection across both the horizontal and vertical center axes relative to the input 2x2 block's local coordinates. The original input 2x2 block remains unchanged in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
grid_properties:
  size: 6x6 for both input and output

input_objects:
  - type: block
    shape: 2x2
    pixels: non-white, typically distinct colors
    location: variable, but near the center, surrounded by white pixels
    count: 1

output_objects:
  - type: block
    shape: 2x2
    pixels: same as the input block's pixels
    location: same as the input block's location
    origin: copied directly from input

    shape: 2x2
    pixels: solid color (monochromatic)
    location: bottom-right corner (4:6, 4:6)
    count: 1

relationships_and_actions:
  - action: identify
    target: the 2x2 non-white block in the input grid
    attributes: location (top-left coordinate) and pixel colors (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
  - action: copy
    source: the identified input 2x2 block
    destination: the same location in the output grid
  - action: map_color_and_fill
    source: input block top-left pixel color
    destination: output bottom-right 2x2 corner block
  - action: map_color_and_fill
    source: input block top-right pixel color
    destination: output bottom-left 2x2 corner block
  - action: map_color_and_fill
    source: input block bottom-left pixel color
    destination: output top-right 2x2 corner block
  - action: map_color_and_fill
    source: input block bottom-right pixel color
    destination: output top-left 2x2 corner block

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Locate the 2x2 block of non-white pixels within the input grid. Let its top-left pixel be at `(row, col)`.
3.  Extract the colors of the four pixels within this input block:
    *   `color_TL` = color at `(row, col)`
    *   `color_TR` = color at `(row, col + 1)`
    *   `color_BL` = color at `(row + 1, col)`
    *   `color_BR` = color at `(row + 1, col + 1)`
4.  Fill the 2x2 area in the top-left corner of the output grid (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) with `color_BR`.
5.  Fill the 2x2 area in the top-right corner of the output grid (rows 0-1, columns 4-5) with `color_BL`.
6.  Fill the 2x2 area in the bottom-left corner of the output grid (rows 4-5, columns 0-1) with `color_TR`.
7.  Fill the 2x2 area in the bottom-right corner of the output grid (rows 4-5, columns 4-5) with `color_TL`.
8.  The output grid now contains the original central pattern plus the four corner patterns derived from its colors.
