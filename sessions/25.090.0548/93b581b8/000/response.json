It contains a single 2x2 block of non-white pixels. The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels. The position of this 2x2 block varies, but it seems to be somewhat centered, not touching the absolute edges. The four pixels within the 2x2 block have different colors.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output is also a 6x6 grid. It retains the original 2x2 block from the input in its exact position and with its original colors. Additionally, the four 2x2 corners of the output grid are filled with solid colors. The top-left corner (rows 0-1, cols 0-1), top-right corner (rows 0-1, cols 4-5), bottom-left corner (rows 4-5, cols 0-1), and bottom-right corner (rows 4-5, cols 4-5) are each filled with a single color, creating four 2x2 monochromatic blocks.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves mapping the colors from the input's 2x2 block to the output's corner 2x2 blocks.\n    *   The color of the **top-left** pixel in the input's 2x2 block determines the color of the **bottom-right** corner block in the output.\n    *   The color of the **top-right** pixel in the input's 2x2 block determines the color of the **bottom-left** corner block in the output.\n    *   The color of the **bottom-left** pixel in the input's 2x2 block determines the color of the **top-right** corner block in the output.\n    *   The color of the **bottom-right** pixel in the input's 2x2 block determines the color of the **top-left** corner block in the output.\n    This mapping corresponds to a 180-degree rotation or a reflection across both the horizontal and vertical center axes relative to the input 2x2 block's local coordinates. The original input 2x2 block remains unchanged in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
