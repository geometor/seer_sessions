```python
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

"""
Analyze the frequency of non-white (non-zero) colors in the input grid.
If the count of the most frequent non-white color is less than 10, the output is a 1x1 grid containing that color.
If the count of the most frequent non-white color is 10 or more:
  - If there is only one non-white color, output a 1x1 grid of that color.
  - If there are multiple non-white colors, determine the two most frequent non-white colors (color1 and color2).
  - Construct a 2x2 output grid.
  - The top row is [color1, color1].
  - If color1 < color2, the bottom row is [color2, color1].
  - If color1 >= color2, the bottom row is [color1, color2].
