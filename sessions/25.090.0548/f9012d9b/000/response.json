A threshold (specifically, 10) determines the size and content of the output grid.\n    *   If the count of the most frequent non-white color is below the threshold, the output is a simple 1x1 grid containing that color.\n    *   If the count meets or exceeds the threshold, the output is a 2x2 grid constructed using the two most frequent non-white colors.\n    *   The specific arrangement of the two colors in the 2x2 grid depends on the numerical comparison of their color values (indices).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
