            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The task operates on 2D grids of pixels. All examples have grids with 3 rows, but varying widths.\n2.  **Colors**: The input grids use only white (0) and red (2). The output grids introduce yellow (4) while retaining the original white and red pixels.\n3.  **Input Pattern**: The red (2) pixels in the input form a consistent, repeating diagonal pattern across the three rows.\n    *   Row 0: `2 0 0 0` repeated\n    *   Row 1: `0 2 0 2` repeated\n    *   Row 2: `0 0 2 0` repeated\n4.  **Output Pattern**: The output grids maintain the original red pixel pattern. Some of the white pixels from the input are changed to yellow (4) in the output, while others remain white.\n5.  **Transformation**: The key change is the conversion of *some* white pixels to yellow. Observing the locations, the yellow pixels appear in areas that are \"enclosed\" or \"bounded\" by the red pixels. White pixels that have a path (moving horizontally or vertically only through other white pixels) to the edge of the grid remain white. White pixels that are trapped by red pixels and cannot reach the edge change to yellow.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Identify all white pixels in the input grid that are located on any of the four boundaries (top row, bottom row, leftmost column, rightmost column).\n3.  Perform a \"flood fill\" search (like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) starting from these boundary white pixels. This search explores adjacent white pixels (horizontally and vertically). Mark all white pixels reachable from the boundary during this search.\n4.  Iterate through all pixels in the original input grid.\n5.  If a pixel is white and was *not* marked as reachable from the boundary in step 3, change its color to yellow in the output grid.\n6.  Leave all red pixels and all white pixels marked as reachable from the boundary unchanged.\n7.  The final modified grid is the result."
