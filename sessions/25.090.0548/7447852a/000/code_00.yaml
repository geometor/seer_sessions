Objects:
  - type: Pattern
    color: red
    description: A fixed, repeating diagonal pattern across the 3 rows. Acts as a barrier.
    pixels_row0: [2, 0, 0, 0] repeating

  - type: BackgroundArea
    color: white
    description: Areas of white pixels in the input.
  - type: FilledArea
    color: yellow
    description: Appears in the output, replacing some white pixels from the input.

Relationships:
  - type: Containment
    description: Red pixels form boundaries around some white pixel areas.
  - type: Reachability
    description: White pixels can be categorized based on whether they can reach the grid boundary by moving only through other white pixels (horizontally or vertically).

Actions:
  - type: Identify
    target: White pixels that cannot reach the grid boundary without crossing a red pixel.
  - type: ChangeColor
    source_color: white
    target_color: yellow
    condition: Applies only to the identified "enclosed" white pixels.
  - type: PreserveColor
    target_color: red
    condition: All red pixels remain unchanged.
  - type: PreserveColor
    target_color: white
    condition: Applies only to white pixels that *can* reach the grid boundary.
