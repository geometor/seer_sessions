Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure**: The task operates on 2D grids of pixels. All examples have grids with 3 rows, but varying widths.
2.  **Colors**: The input grids use only white (0) and red (2). The output grids introduce yellow (4) while retaining the original white and red pixels.
3.  **Input Pattern**: The red (2) pixels in the input form a consistent, repeating diagonal pattern across the three rows.
    *   Row 0: `2 0 0 0` repeated
    *   Row 1: `0 2 0 2` repeated
    *   Row 2: `0 0 2 0` repeated
4.  **Output Pattern**: The output grids maintain the original red pixel pattern. Some of the white pixels from the input are changed to yellow (4) in the output, while others remain white.
5.  **Transformation**: The key change is the conversion of *some* white pixels to yellow. Observing the locations, the yellow pixels appear in areas that are "enclosed" or "bounded" by the red pixels. White pixels that have a path (moving horizontally or vertically only through other white pixels) to the edge of the grid remain white. White pixels that are trapped by red pixels and cannot reach the edge change to yellow.

Relationships:
  - type: Containment
    description: Red pixels form boundaries around some white pixel areas.
  - type: Reachability
    description: White pixels can be categorized based on whether they can reach the grid boundary by moving only through other white pixels (horizontally or vertically).

Actions:
  - type: Identify
    target: White pixels that cannot reach the grid boundary without crossing a red pixel.
  - type: ChangeColor
    source_color: white
    target_color: yellow
    condition: Applies only to the identified "enclosed" white pixels.
  - type: PreserveColor
    target_color: red
    condition: All red pixels remain unchanged.
  - type: PreserveColor
    target_color: white
    condition: Applies only to white pixels that *can* reach the grid boundary.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
2.  Identify all white pixels in the input grid that are located on any of the four boundaries (top row, bottom row, leftmost column, rightmost column).
3.  Perform a "flood fill" search (like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) starting from these boundary white pixels. This search explores adjacent white pixels (horizontally and vertically). Mark all white pixels reachable from the boundary during this search.
4.  Iterate through all pixels in the original input grid.
5.  If a pixel is white and was *not* marked as reachable from the boundary in step 3, change its color to yellow in the output grid.
6.  Leave all red pixels and all white pixels marked as reachable from the boundary unchanged.
7.  The final modified grid is the result.
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

"""
Identify white pixels (0) that are 'enclosed' by red pixels (2) and cannot reach the grid boundary by moving horizontally or vertically through other white pixels. Change these enclosed white pixels to yellow (4). Leave all other pixels (red pixels and white pixels connected to the boundary) unchanged.

1. Copy the input grid to create the output grid.
2. Find all white pixels located on the boundary (edges) of the grid.
3. Perform a flood fill (BFS or DFS) starting from these boundary white pixels, marking all reachable white pixels. Only move horizontally or vertically.
4. Iterate through the grid. Any white pixel that was not reached during the flood fill is considered enclosed.
5. Change the color of these enclosed white pixels to yellow in the output grid.
6. Return the modified output grid.
