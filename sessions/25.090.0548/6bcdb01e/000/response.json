The original green (3) pixels also remain unchanged in the output.\n4.  **Color Transformation**: Many orange (7) pixels in the input are changed to green (3) in the output. Some orange pixels remain orange.\n5.  **Spatial Relationship**: The transformation seems related to the initial green (3) pixels. The green color appears to \"spread\" outwards from the initial green pixel(s) into adjacent orange (7) areas.\n6.  **Boundaries**: The spread of the green color seems to be contained or blocked by the azure (8) pixels. The green color does not replace or cross over the azure pixels.\n7.  **Connectivity**: The orange pixels that change to green appear to be connected (including diagonally) to the original green source pixels through a path consisting only of other orange pixels (which also get changed). Orange pixels separated from the green source by azure pixels do not change color.\n8.  **Mechanism**: This pattern strongly suggests a \"flood fill\" or \"region growing\" algorithm starting from the green pixels, filling the orange pixels, and being bounded by the azure pixels.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
