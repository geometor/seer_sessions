task_description: "Perform a flood fill operation starting from green pixels, filling orange pixels, bounded by azure pixels."
elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: remain constant between input and output.
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: can be green(3), orange(7), or azure(8).
      - role:
          - green(3): source color for the fill operation.
          - orange(7): fillable color.
          - azure(8): barrier color, stops the fill.
      - state_change:
          - green(3): remains green(3).
          - azure(8): remains azure(8).
          - orange(7): changes to green(3) if reachable from a source green(3) pixel via a path of only orange(7) pixels without crossing an azure(8) pixel. Otherwise, remains orange(7).
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side or a corner (8-connectivity).
  - type: connectivity
    description: An orange(7) pixel is connected to a source green(3) pixel if a path exists between them using only adjacent orange(7) pixels.
  - type: boundary
    description: Azure(8) pixels act as boundaries, preventing the fill operation from spreading into or across them.
actions:
  - action: flood_fill
    parameters:
      - start_pixels: all pixels with the source color (green, 3) in the input.
      - fill_color: green(3).
      - target_color: orange(7).
      - barrier_color: azure(8).
    constraints:
      - Fill only spreads to adjacent (including diagonal) pixels.
      - Fill only changes pixels that originally had the target color (orange, 7).
      - Fill cannot spread into or across pixels with the barrier color (azure, 8).
