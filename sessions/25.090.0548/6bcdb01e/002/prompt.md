"""
Perform a flood fill operation starting from green (3) pixels. 
The fill spreads into adjacent (including diagonal) orange (7) pixels. 
The fill is bounded by azure (8) pixels and the grid boundaries. 
Azure (8) pixels and original green (3) pixels remain unchanged.
Orange (7) pixels that are not reachable from a green (3) source pixel 
via a path of only orange (7) pixels also remain unchanged.
