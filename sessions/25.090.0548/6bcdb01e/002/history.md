Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure**: Both input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example (7x7 for train_1, 5x5 for train_2).
2.  **Colors Present**: The primary colors involved are green (3), orange (7), and azure (8).
3.  **Color Persistence**: Azure (8) pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output. The original green (3) pixels also remain unchanged in the output.
4.  **Color Transformation**: Many orange (7) pixels in the input are changed to green (3) in the output. Some orange pixels remain orange.
5.  **Spatial Relationship**: The transformation seems related to the initial green (3) pixels. The green color appears to "spread" outwards from the initial green pixel(s) into adjacent orange (7) areas.
6.  **Boundaries**: The spread of the green color seems to be contained or blocked by the azure (8) pixels. The green color does not replace or cross over the azure pixels.
7.  **Connectivity**: The orange pixels that change to green appear to be connected (including diagonally) to the original green source pixels through a path consisting only of other orange pixels (which also get changed). Orange pixels separated from the green source by azure pixels do not change color.
8.  **Mechanism**: This pattern strongly suggests a "flood fill" or "region growing" algorithm starting from the green pixels, filling the orange pixels, and being bounded by the azure pixels.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: "Perform a flood fill operation starting from green pixels, filling orange pixels, bounded by azure pixels."
elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: remain constant between input and output.
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: can be green(3), orange(7), or azure(8).
      - role:
          - green(3): source color for the fill operation.
          - orange(7): fillable color.
          - azure(8): barrier color, stops the fill.
      - state_change:
          - green(3): remains green(3).
          - azure(8): remains azure(8).
          - orange(7): changes to green(3) if reachable from a source green(3) pixel via a path of only orange(7) pixels without crossing an azure(8) pixel. Otherwise, remains orange(7).
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side or a corner (8-connectivity).
  - type: connectivity
    description: An orange(7) pixel is connected to a source green(3) pixel if a path exists between them using only adjacent orange(7) pixels.
  - type: boundary
    description: Azure(8) pixels act as boundaries, preventing the fill operation from spreading into or across them.
actions:
  - action: flood_fill
    parameters:
      - start_pixels: all pixels with the source color (green, 3) in the input.
      - fill_color: green(3).
      - target_color: orange(7).
      - barrier_color: azure(8).
    constraints:
      - Fill only spreads to adjacent (including diagonal) pixels.
      - Fill only changes pixels that originally had the target color (orange, 7).
      - Fill cannot spread into or across pixels with the barrier color (azure, 8).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the source color (green, 3). Create a list or queue of these initial locations to process.
3.  Create a set to keep track of visited locations to avoid redundant processing. Add the initial source locations to the visited set.
4.  While the list/queue of locations to process is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue a location (row, col).
    b.  Examine its 8 neighbors (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally adjacent).
    c.  For each neighbor:
        i.  Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.
        ii. Check if the neighbor has *not* already been visited.
        iii. Check if the neighbor's color in the *input* grid is the fillable color (orange, 7).
        iv. If all these conditions are true:
            1.  Change the color of the neighbor pixel in the *output* grid to the fill color (green, 3).
            2.  Add the neighbor's location to the visited set.
            3.  Enqueue the neighbor's location for further processing.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
