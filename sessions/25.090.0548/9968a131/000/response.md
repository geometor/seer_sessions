Okay, let's break down the transformation based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids maintain the same dimensions in each example pair (4x4 for the first, 6x6 for the second).
2.  **Row-Based Transformation:** The changes occur on a row-by-row basis. Comparing input and output rows reveals that some rows are identical, while others are modified.
3.  **Conditional Change:** The modification specifically targets rows with odd indices (row 1, row 3, row 5, etc., using 0-based indexing). Rows with even indices (row 0, row 2, row 4, etc.) remain unchanged from input to output.
4.  **Nature of Change:** For the rows that *are* modified (odd-indexed rows), the transformation involves rearranging the pixels within that row. Observing the pattern (`7 8 3 7` -> `7 7 8 3` and `5 0 7 7 7 7` -> `7 5 0 7 7 7`), it appears to be a right circular shift. The last element of the input row becomes the first element of the output row, and all other elements shift one position to the right.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input_output_properties:
  dimensions_preserved: true # Input and output grids have the same height and width
  colors_preserved: true # The set of colors present might change slightly due to rearrangement, but no new colors are introduced outside the input set.
transformation_logic:
  scope: row-based # The transformation applies independently to each row.
  condition:
    type: row_index
    predicate: is_odd # Applies only to rows with odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...).
  action:
    type: pixel_rearrangement
    subtype: circular_shift
    direction: right
    description: Pixels within the affected row are shifted one position to the right, with the last pixel wrapping around to the first position.
  unchanged_elements:
    condition:
      type: row_index
      predicate: is_even # Applies to rows with even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).
    action: copy # Rows with even indices are copied directly from input to output.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row index (starting from 0).
3.  For each row:
    a.  Check if the row index is odd (i.e., 1, 3, 5, ...).
    b.  **If the row index is odd:**
        i.  Perform a right circular shift on the pixels within that row. Specifically, take the last pixel of the input row and place it at the beginning of the corresponding output row. Then, take the first pixel of the input row and place it in the second position of the output row, the second pixel of the input row into the third position of the output row, and so on, until the second-to-last pixel of the input row is placed in the last position of the output row.
    c.  **If the row index is even:**
        i.  Copy the row directly from the input grid to the corresponding row in the output grid without any changes.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
