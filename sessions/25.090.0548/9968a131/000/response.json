Comparing input and output rows reveals that some rows are identical, while others are modified.\n3.  **Conditional Change:** The modification specifically targets rows with odd indices (row 1, row 3, row 5, etc., using 0-based indexing). Rows with even indices (row 0, row 2, row 4, etc.) remain unchanged from input to output.\n4.  **Nature of Change:** For the rows that *are* modified (odd-indexed rows), the transformation involves rearranging the pixels within that row. Observing the pattern (`7 8 3 7` -> `7 7 8 3` and `5 0 7 7 7 7` -> `7 5 0 7 7 7`), it appears to be a right circular shift. The last element of the input row becomes the first element of the output row, and all other elements shift one position to the right.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
