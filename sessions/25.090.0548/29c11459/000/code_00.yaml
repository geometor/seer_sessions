task_type: pattern_completion
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: consistent between input and output (e.g., 5x11 in examples)
  - background_color: predominantly white (0)

objects:
  - type: colored_pixels
    properties:
      - location: specific row and column index
      - color: non-white (1-9)
      - count_per_row: typically two in affected rows
      - initial_position: column 0 (left edge) and last column (right edge) in affected rows
  - type: generated_segments
    properties:
      - color: inherited from edge pixels
      - orientation: horizontal
      - extent: from edge towards the center
  - type: central_divider
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - location: exact horizontal midpoint column of the affected row
      - shape: single pixel in the affected row

actions:
  - name: identify_target_rows
    criteria:
      - count of non-white pixels is exactly 2
      - one non-white pixel is at column 0
      - the other non-white pixel is at the last column
  - name: expand_left_pixel
    direction: rightward
    color: same as the pixel at column 0
    endpoint: column before the midpoint
  - name: expand_right_pixel
    direction: leftward
    color: same as the pixel at the last column
    endpoint: column after the midpoint
  - name: place_divider
    color: gray (5)
    location: midpoint column

relationships:
  - input_output: Output grid is derived from the input grid by modifying specific rows.
  - row_transformation: Transformation is applied independently to each row based on its content.
  - color_inheritance: The expanded segments inherit the colors of the initial edge pixels.
  - midpoint_dependency: The placement of the gray divider and the endpoints of the expanded segments depend on the grid width (specifically, the calculated midpoint column).
