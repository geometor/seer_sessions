            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\nThe input and output grids have the same dimensions. In the provided examples, the dimensions are 5x11. The core transformation appears to operate row by row.\n\n1.  **Identify Target Rows:** The transformation specifically targets rows that contain exactly two non-white pixels, one located at the very beginning (column 0) and the other at the very end (last column) of the row. Rows that don't meet this criterion remain unchanged.\n2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** Within a target row, the leftmost colored pixel expands horizontally to the right, filling the cells with its color. Simultaneously, the rightmost colored pixel expands horizontally to the left, filling cells with its color.\n3.  **Midpoint Fill:** The expansion from both sides stops just before the horizontal midpoint of the row. The exact midpoint column is then filled with a gray pixel (color 5).\n4.  **Example 1:** The green pixel (3) at (3, 0) expands right to (3, 4). The orange pixel (7) at (3, 10) expands left to (3, 6). The midpoint column (index 5) is filled with gray (5) at (3, 5).\n5.  **Example 2:** The blue pixel (1) at (1, 0) expands right to (1, 4). The red pixel (2) at (1, 10) expands left to (1, 6). The midpoint column (index 5) is filled with gray (5) at (1, 5).\n\nThe transformation essentially creates a horizontal bar in the target rows, composed of two colored segments originating from the edges and meeting at a central gray divider.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

If the count is 2, check if the first pixel (column 0) is non-white and the last pixel (column `width - 1`) is non-white.\n    d.  If both conditions (b and c) are true:\n        i.  Determine the color of the leftmost pixel (`left_color`) and the rightmost pixel (`right_color`).\n        ii. Calculate the midpoint column index: `mid_col = floor((width - 1) / 2)`.\n        iii.
