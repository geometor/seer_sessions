**Metrics Analysis:**

*   The `find_movable_objects` function correctly identifies the objects.
*   The sorting logic `key=lambda obj: (-obj['length'], obj['row'])` correctly implements: primary sort by length descending (`-obj['length']`), secondary sort by original row ascending (`obj['row']`).
*   The sequence of objects in the `code_output` matches the expected stacking order (bottom-up) derived from the expected outputs.
*   The key mistake was assuming the horizontal position (`col_start`, `col_end`) was preserved. It should be calculated based on right-alignment.

**Recap of Tie-breaking:**
My initial analysis of Example 1 tie-breaking was slightly confused. Let's re-verify:
Ex 1: Red (len 3, row 2), Green (len 2, row 4). No tie needed. Sorted: Red, Green.
My previous note said: "In Example 1, two lines (red and green) have the same length (3)." - This was WRONG. Red is length 3, Green is length 2.
Let's imagine a tie: If Red was length 2 (row 2) and Green was length 2 (row 4). Sorting key `(-length, row)` would give `(-2, 2)` for Red and `(-2, 4)` for Green. Sorting these tuples gives `(-2, 2)` first, then `(-2, 4)`. So Red (row 2) would be placed first (lower), then Green (row 4). This matches the "original row ascending" tie-breaker rule (`obj['row']`).

**Final Confirmation of Rules:**
1.  Find base (azure line, row `r_base`).
2.  Find movable objects (non-0, non-8 horizontal lines), note color, length, original row (`r_orig`), original columns.
3.  Sort objects by length descending, then by `r_orig` ascending.
4.  Initialize output grid (all 0s).
5.  Copy base line to output at `r_base`.
6.  Set `stack_row = r_base - 1`.
7.  For each sorted object:
    *   Calculate `new_col_start = grid_width - object_length`.
    *   Calculate `new_col_end = grid_width - 1`.
    *   Place object color in `output_grid[stack_row, new_col_start:new_col_end + 1]`.
    *   Decrement `stack_row`.
8.  Return output grid.

This seems consistent with all examples now.**General Assessment**

The previous attempt correctly identified the core task: sorting horizontal colored lines (objects) by length and stacking them. The sorting order (length descending, original row ascending for ties) was also correctly identified based on the code execution metrics. The key error was in determining the *horizontal placement* of the objects in the output stack. The initial assumption that original column indices were preserved was incorrect. Analysis of the failed examples shows that the objects are instead **right-aligned** within the grid width when placed in the output stack.

**Strategy for Resolution**

1.  Modify the logic for placing objects in the output grid. Instead of using the original `col_start` and `col_end`, calculate the new starting column based on the object's length and the grid's width to achieve right-alignment.
2.  Update the Facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this right-alignment rule accurately.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Rearrange horizontal colored lines by length, stacking them right-aligned above a fixed base.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors) with width W and height H.
  - Background_Color: White (0).
  - Base_Object:
      - Identifier: A horizontal line of Azure (8) pixels, typically full width.
      - Position: Usually occupies the bottom-most row (row H-1).
      - Behavior: Fixed; remains unchanged in the output at its original position. If absent, the effective base for stacking is the bottom edge of the grid.
  - Movable_Objects:
      - Identifier: Horizontal contiguous lines of a single color.
      - Exclusions: White (0) background pixels and Azure (8) base pixels.
      - Properties:
          - color: The integer value (1-7, 9).
          - length: The number of pixels (width) of the line.
          - original_row: Row index in the input grid.
          - original_col_start: Starting column index in the input grid.
          - original_col_end: Ending column index in the input grid.

Transformation:
  - Action: Collect, sort, and stack Movable_Objects vertically above the Base_Object (or grid bottom), applying right-alignment.
  - Process:
      1. Identify the Base_Object (Azure line) and its row index (`base_row`). If no base object exists, `base_row` is conceptually H.
      2. Identify all Movable_Objects and their properties (color, length, original_row, original_col_start, original_col_end).
      3. Sort the Movable_Objects:
          - Primary key: By `length` in descending order.
          - Secondary key: By `original_row` in ascending order (topmost first in case of length tie).
      4. Create an output grid of the same dimensions (W x H) as the input, initialized to White (0).
      5. If a Base_Object exists, copy it to the output grid at `base_row`.
      6. Initialize the `current_stack_row` to `base_row - 1`.
      7. Iterate through the sorted Movable_Objects:
          a. Calculate the target horizontal position for right-alignment:
             - `target_col_start = W - length`
             - `target_col_end = W - 1`
          b. Place the current object's `color` into the output grid at `current_stack_row`, spanning columns from `target_col_start` to `target_col_end`.
          c. Decrement `current_stack_row` by 1.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions (W x H) as input.
  - Base_Object: Azure line (if present in input) in the same bottom row position.
  - Stacked_Objects: The Movable_Objects from the input, stacked vertically above the Base_Object (or bottom edge).
      - Vertical Order: Determined by the sort (longest first, then topmost original position).
      - Horizontal Position: Each object is right-aligned within the grid width.
  - Background: Remaining grid cells are White (0).

Relationships:
  - The final vertical position of a Movable_Object depends on its length and original row relative to other Movable_Objects.
  - The final horizontal position depends *only* on the object's length and the grid width (right-aligned). Original horizontal position is ignored for placement.
  - All Movable_Objects are stacked contiguously above the fixed Base_Object or grid bottom.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Search the input grid, starting from the bottom row and moving upwards, to find the first row composed entirely of azure (8) pixels. If found, copy this azure line to the exact same row in the output grid and record its row index as `base_row`. If no such line is found, set `base_row` to be the total height of the grid (effectively placing the base just below the last row).
3.  Identify all distinct horizontal, contiguous lines of pixels in the input grid that are *not* white (0) and *not* azure (8). For each such line (object), record its color, its length (number of pixels), and its original row index in the input grid.
4.  Create a list of these identified objects.
5.  Sort this list of objects based on two criteria:
    *   Primary criterion: Sort by object length in descending order (longest objects first).
    *   Secondary criterion (for ties in length): Sort by the original row index in ascending order (objects that were originally higher in the input grid come first).
6.  Determine the width of the grid.
7.  Initialize a `current_stack_row` variable to `base_row - 1`.
8.  Iterate through the sorted list of objects:
    *   For the current object, retrieve its color and length.
    *   Calculate the starting column for placing the object in the output grid: `start_column = grid_width - object_length`.
    *   Place the object's color into the output grid at the `current_stack_row`, filling the cells from `start_column` up to the last column (inclusive).
    *   Decrement the `current_stack_row` by 1 (to move up one row for the next object).
9.  Return the completed output grid.
