Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Size:** The input grids are relatively large (e.g., 11x11), while the output grids are consistently small (3x3).
2.  **Color Palette:** The input grids contain various colors (magenta, gray, orange, red, green, yellow, blue, maroon) scattered on a white background (0). The output grids reuse some of these colors.
3.  **Key Color - Gray (5):** Gray pixels (value 5) appear in all input examples. They seem to play a crucial role. In the output grids, the center pixel (index 1, 1) is *always* gray (5).
4.  **Spatial Relationship:** The arrangement of colors in the 3x3 output grid appears to be related to the spatial arrangement of colors in the input grid, specifically relative to the positions of the gray pixels.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying non-gray, non-white pixels in the input, determining their position relative to the *nearest* gray pixel, and then mapping those pixels onto the 3x3 output grid if their relative position falls within a 3x3 neighborhood centered on the gray pixel. The output grid's center is then set to gray.

**Facts**


```yaml
Observations:
  - Input grids contain scattered colored objects/pixels on a white background.
  - Gray pixels (color 5) are present in all inputs and act as reference points.
  - Output grids are always 3x3.
  - The center pixel of the output grid (1, 1) is always gray (5).
  - Other pixels in the output grid derive their color and position from input pixels.

Process:
  - Identify all gray pixels (value 5) in the input grid; these are 'anchors'.
  - For every non-white (0) and non-gray (5) pixel P in the input:
    - Find the gray anchor pixel A closest to P (using Manhattan distance).
    - Calculate the relative offset (row_offset, col_offset) of P from A. (P.row - A.row, P.col - A.col)
    - If the absolute value of both row_offset and col_offset is less than or equal to 1:
      - The corresponding position in the 3x3 output grid (1 + row_offset, 1 + col_offset) takes the color of pixel P.
  - Initialize the 3x3 output grid with white (0).
  - Perform the mapping described above for all relevant input pixels.
  - Finally, set the center pixel of the output grid (1, 1) to gray (5), potentially overwriting any color previously mapped there.

Distance Metric:
  - Manhattan distance is used to find the closest gray anchor. `dist = |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|`.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new 3x3 grid, initially filled with white pixels (0). Call this the `output_grid`.
2.  Locate all pixels in the `input_grid` that have the color gray (5). Store their coordinates (row, column) as a list of `anchor_points`.
3.  Iterate through each pixel P at `(r, c)` in the `input_grid`.
4.  If the color of P is *not* white (0) and *not* gray (5):
    a.  Calculate the Manhattan distance from P to every anchor point in `anchor_points`.
    b.  Identify the `closest_anchor_point` (gr, gc) that has the minimum Manhattan distance to P. (If there's a tie, any of the closest anchors can be chosen).
    c.  Calculate the row offset `dr = r - gr` and column offset `dc = c - gc`.
    d.  Check if `dr` is between -1 and 1 (inclusive) *and* `dc` is between -1 and 1 (inclusive).
    e.  If both offsets are within the [-1, 1] range, set the pixel in the `output_grid` at position `(1 + dr, 1 + dc)` to the color of pixel P.
5.  After checking all pixels in the `input_grid`, set the pixel in the `output_grid` at position `(1, 1)` to gray (5).
6.  Return the `output_grid`.
