Observations:
  - Input grids contain scattered colored objects/pixels on a white background.
  - Gray pixels (color 5) are present in all inputs and act as reference points.
  - Output grids are always 3x3.
  - The center pixel of the output grid (1, 1) is always gray (5).
  - Other pixels in the output grid derive their color and position from input pixels.

Process:
  - Identify all gray pixels (value 5) in the input grid; these are 'anchors'.
  - For every non-white (0) and non-gray (5) pixel P in the input:
    - Find the gray anchor pixel A closest to P (using Manhattan distance).
    - Calculate the relative offset (row_offset, col_offset) of P from A. (P.row - A.row, P.col - A.col)
    - If the absolute value of both row_offset and col_offset is less than or equal to 1:
      - The corresponding position in the 3x3 output grid (1 + row_offset, 1 + col_offset) takes the color of pixel P.
  - Initialize the 3x3 output grid with white (0).
  - Perform the mapping described above for all relevant input pixels.
  - Finally, set the center pixel of the output grid (1, 1) to gray (5), potentially overwriting any color previously mapped there.

Distance Metric:
  - Manhattan distance is used to find the closest gray anchor. `dist = |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|`.
