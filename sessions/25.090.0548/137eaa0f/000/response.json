The output grids reuse some of these colors.\n3.  **Key Color - Gray (5):** Gray pixels (value 5) appear in all input examples. They seem to play a crucial role. In the output grids, the center pixel (index 1, 1) is *always* gray (5).\n4.  **Spatial Relationship:** The arrangement of colors in the 3x3 output grid appears to be related to the spatial arrangement of colors in the input grid, specifically relative to the positions of the gray pixels.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying non-gray, non-white pixels in the input, determining their position relative to the *nearest* gray pixel, and then mapping those pixels onto the 3x3 output grid if their relative position falls within a 3x3 neighborhood centered on the gray pixel. The output grid's center is then set to gray.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

(P.row - A.row, P.col - A.col)\n    - If the absolute value of both row_offset and col_offset is less than or equal to 1:\n      - The corresponding position in the 3x3 output grid (1 + row_offset, 1 + col_offset) takes the color of pixel P.\n  - Initialize the 3x3 output grid with white (0).\n  - Perform the mapping described above for all relevant input pixels.\n  - Finally, set the center pixel of the output grid (1, 1) to gray (5), potentially overwriting any color previously mapped there.\n\nDistance Metric:\n  - Manhattan distance is used to find the closest gray anchor. `dist = |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|`.\n```"
