Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are rectangular grids of pixels with different colors. The dominant color is typically Azure (8), acting as a background.
2.  **Object Identification:** In each input grid, there is a single contiguous object made of a non-background color (Red-2, Maroon-9, Yellow-4). These objects vary in shape (vertical line, rectangle).
3.  **Transformation Goal:** The transformation involves keeping the original object and adding new shapes of the same color to the grid.
4.  **Added Shapes:** The shapes added depend on the dimensions (height H, width W) of the original object.
    *   If the object is a vertical line (W=1), new horizontal and sometimes vertical lines of length H are added near the grid boundaries. The number and placement vary between Example 1 (H=5) and Example 3 (H=2).
    *   If the object is a rectangle (H>1, W>1), a copy of the object is added at the top-right, and a horizontal line related to the object's width (W+1) is added at the bottom-center.
5.  **Color Preservation:** The color of the added shapes is always the same as the color of the original object. The background remains unchanged.
6.  **Positional Logic:** The placement of the added shapes seems related to the corners and edges of the grid, and sometimes involves centering (Example 2). The rules for placement appear specific to the object's shape category (vertical line vs. rectangle) and potentially its exact dimensions (height of the vertical line).

common_properties:
  background_color: 8 # Azure seems consistent as background
  object_count: Exactly one non-background object in input.
  action: Add shapes based on original object's properties (color, H, W).
  color_rule: Added shapes use the same color as the original object.
  original_object_persistence: The original object remains in the output grid.

relationships:
  - The type and placement of added shapes depend on the original object's shape category (vertical line vs. rectangle) and dimensions (H, W).
  - For vertical lines, the specific rule seems to vary based on height H (compare H=5 vs H=2).
  - For rectangles, a copy is added top-right, and a line of length W+1 is added bottom-center.
  - Added shapes are typically lines whose length is derived from the original object's height (H) or width (W), or are direct copies.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Background and Object:** Determine the background color (the most common color in the input grid). Find the single contiguous block of non-background pixels; this is the 'object'. Record its color (C), height (H), and width (W).
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
3.  **Apply Shape-Specific Rule:**
    *   **If the object is a vertical line (W=1):**
        *   **If H = 5:** Create a horizontal line segment of color C and length H (1x5). Add this segment starting at the top-left corner (0,0). Add another identical segment starting at the bottom-left corner (GridHeight-1, 0).
        *   **If H = 2:** Create horizontal segments of color C and length H (1x2). Create vertical segments of color C and length H (2x1). Add these segments at the following fixed locations (assuming GridHeight=7, GridWidth=9 as in the example):
            *   Horizontal at row 0, columns 1-2.
            *   Horizontal at row 0, columns 5-6.
            *   Horizontal at row 6, columns 0-1.
            *   Horizontal at row 6, columns 4-5.
            *   Vertical at column 8, rows 1-2.
            *   Vertical at column 8, rows 5-6.
        *   *(Generalize if possible, otherwise handle specific H values as cases)*
    *   **If the object is a horizontal line (H=1):** *(No direct example, but inferring symmetry)* Create vertical line segments of color C and length W (Wx1). Add these based on a pattern potentially mirroring the vertical line rules (e.g., add at top-left and top-right corners).
    *   **If the object is a rectangle (H>1 and W>1):**
        *   Create a copy of the object (HxW area with color C). Add this copy to the output grid, aligned with the top-right corner (position 0, GridWidth-W).
        *   Create a horizontal line segment of color C and length W+1 (1x(W+1)). Add this segment to the output grid on the bottom row (GridHeight-1), centered horizontally. If W+1 is even and GridWidth is even/odd causing centering ambiguity, default to placing the start slightly left of the exact center.
4.  **Final Output:** Return the modified grid.
