task_elements:
  - element: Grids
    properties:
      - Input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels (0-9).
      - Grid dimensions vary.
  - element: Colors
    properties:
      - A subset of colors (1-9) are present in the input.
      - One color typically acts as a background/filler (e.g., color 7 in examples).
      - Other colors represent distinct objects or pixel groups.
  - element: Pixel Groups (by non-background color)
    properties:
      - Identified by collecting all pixels of a specific non-background color.
      - Characterized by their color and total pixel count (N).
    actions:
      - Count total pixels (N) for each non-background color.
      - Reshape into a solid rectangular block of size h x w, where h * w = N and h, w minimize h + w.
  - element: Output Blocks
    properties:
      - Solid rectangular blocks, each corresponding to a non-background color from the input.
      - Dimensions (h, w) determined by the pixel count N of the corresponding input color.
      - Have a specific color.
    relationships:
      - Sorted by pixel count (N) in ascending order.
  - element: Output Grid
    properties:
      - Dimensions determined by the arrangement of the generated blocks.
      - Height: Maximum height among all generated blocks.
      - Width: Sum of block widths plus single-column gaps between blocks.
      - Contains the generated blocks arranged horizontally, sorted by size (smallest left), bottom-aligned, separated by single columns of the background color.
      - Remaining space filled with the background color.
actions_on_elements:
  - action: Identify Background Color
    actor: Transformation Process
    details: Determine the color that serves as the primary background or filler in the output grid (seems to be color 7 in the examples).
  - action: Quantify and Reshape Non-Background Pixels
    actor: Transformation Process
    details: For each non-background color, count its total pixels (N) in the input and form a solid h x w block where h*w=N and |h-w| is minimized.
  - action: Sort Blocks
    actor: Transformation Process
    details: Arrange the generated blocks in ascending order based on their pixel count (N).
  - action: Assemble Output Grid
    actor: Transformation Process
    details: Create a new grid, place the sorted blocks left-to-right, bottom-aligned, with one column of background color as spacing between them. Fill remaining space with the background color.
