## Perception

1.  **Color Analysis:** Both examples use a limited palette of colors. A dominant color often acts as a background or filler in the output (orange/color 7 in both provided examples).
2.  **Object Identification:** The input grids contain distinct contiguous or non-contiguous groups of pixels of the same color, which are treated as objects or collections of pixels associated with a specific color.
3.  **Transformation Goal:** The core transformation involves identifying non-background colored pixels, quantifying them, reshaping them into solid rectangular (often square) blocks, and arranging these blocks in a new grid.
4.  **Reshaping:** For each non-background color, all pixels of that color in the input are counted. This count (`N`) determines the size of a solid rectangular block in the output. The dimensions (`h`, `w`) of this block are chosen such that `h * w = N` and the shape is as close to a square as possible (minimizing `h + w`).
5.  **Arrangement:** The generated blocks are sorted based on their pixel count (`N`), from smallest to largest.
6.  **Layout:** The sorted blocks are placed horizontally in the output grid, from left to right. They are separated by a single column of the background color. All blocks are bottom-aligned within the output grid.
7.  **Output Grid Size:** The height of the output grid is determined by the height of the tallest block generated. The width is the sum of the widths of all blocks plus the widths of the single-column gaps between them.
8.  **Background Fill:** Any space in the output grid not occupied by the placed blocks is filled with the identified background color.

task_elements:
  - element: Grids
    properties:
      - Input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels (0-9).
      - Grid dimensions vary.
  - element: Colors
    properties:
      - A subset of colors (1-9) are present in the input.
      - One color typically acts as a background/filler (e.g., color 7 in examples).
      - Other colors represent distinct objects or pixel groups.
  - element: Pixel Groups (by non-background color)
    properties:
      - Identified by collecting all pixels of a specific non-background color.
      - Characterized by their color and total pixel count (N).
    actions:
      - Count total pixels (N) for each non-background color.
      - Reshape into a solid rectangular block of size h x w, where h * w = N and h, w minimize h + w.
  - element: Output Blocks
    properties:
      - Solid rectangular blocks, each corresponding to a non-background color from the input.
      - Dimensions (h, w) determined by the pixel count N of the corresponding input color.
      - Have a specific color.
    relationships:
      - Sorted by pixel count (N) in ascending order.
  - element: Output Grid
    properties:
      - Dimensions determined by the arrangement of the generated blocks.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Background Color:** Determine the background color. This is the color that appears to fill the empty spaces in the output grid (e.g., orange/color 7).
2.  **Isolate and Count Non-Background Pixels:** For every color present in the input grid *other* than the background color:
    *   Count the total number of pixels (`N`) of that color.
3.  **Create Color Blocks:** For each non-background color identified in step 2:
    *   Calculate the dimensions (`h`, `w`) for a solid rectangular block such that `h * w = N` and the dimensions `h` and `w` are as close to each other as possible (i.e., minimize `h + w` among factors of `N`). If N is 1, the block is 1x1.
    *   Create an `h` x `w` block filled entirely with that color. Associate this block with its original color and its pixel count `N`.
4.  **Sort Blocks:** Order the created blocks based on their pixel count (`N`), from the smallest count to the largest count.
5.  **Determine Output Grid Dimensions:**
    *   Calculate the maximum height (`H`) among all the created blocks. This will be the height of the output grid.
    *   Calculate the total width (`W`) required: Sum the widths of all blocks in the sorted order, and add `number_of_blocks - 1` (for the single-column gaps between blocks). This will be the width of the output grid.
6.  **Construct Output Grid:**
    *   Create a new grid of size `H` x `W`, initially filled entirely with the background color identified in step 1.
    *   Initialize a horizontal placement cursor `current_col = 0`.
7.  **Place Blocks:** Iterate through the blocks, in the order determined in step 4 (sorted by size):
    *   For the current block with color `C`, height `h`, and width `w`:
        *   Calculate the starting row for placement: `start_row = H - h` (to achieve bottom-alignment).
        *   Place the `h` x `w` block of color `C` into the output grid, covering rows `start_row` to `H-1` and columns `current_col` to `current_col + w - 1`.
        *   Update the horizontal placement cursor: `current_col = current_col + w + 1` (move past the placed block and the following single-column gap).
8.  **Finalize:** The grid constructed in steps 6 and 7 is the final output.
