            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids vary in height but seem to maintain a consistent width (9 columns). They all feature a single horizontal line composed of gray pixels (color 5). This gray line acts as a separator, dividing the grid into an upper and a lower region. The background is white (color 0).\n2.  **Objects:** The significant objects, apart from the background and the gray line, are individual pixels of red (color 2) and yellow (color 4). These pixels are scattered in both the upper and lower regions relative to the gray line.\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is consistently a 2x2 square.\n4.  **Transformation:** The color filling the output grid seems dependent on the relative counts of red and yellow pixels in the input grid. Specifically, it appears to focus on the region *below* the gray line.\n    *   In `train_1`, below the gray line, there are 4 red pixels and 4 yellow pixels. The output is red.\n    *   In `train_2`, below the gray line, there are 4 red pixels and 4 yellow pixels. The output is red.\n    *   In `train_3`, below the gray line, there are 4 red pixels and 3 yellow pixels. The output is red.\n    *   In `train_4`, below the gray line, there are 2 red pixels and 4 yellow pixels. The output is yellow.\n5.  **Inferred Logic:** The transformation involves:\n    *   Locating the horizontal gray line.\n    *   Focusing on the area below this line.\n    *   Counting the occurrences of red pixels and yellow pixels in this lower area.\n    *   Comparing these counts.\n    *   If red count >= yellow count, the output is a 2x2 grid of red.\n    *   If yellow count > red count, the output is a 2x2 grid of yellow. Red seems to be the default or tie-breaker color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
