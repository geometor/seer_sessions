2. Isolate the region of the grid that lies *below* this gray separator line.
3. Count the total number of red pixels (color 2) within this lower region (`red_count`).
4. Count the total number of yellow pixels (color 4) within this lower region (`yellow_count`).
5. Calculate the difference between the yellow count and the red count (`difference = yellow_count - red_count`).
