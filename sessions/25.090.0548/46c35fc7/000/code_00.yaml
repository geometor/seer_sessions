Input_Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  properties:
    - variable dimensions (height, width)
    - contains pixels with values 0-9 (colors)
    - has a predominant background color: orange (7)

Output_Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  properties:
    - same dimensions as the corresponding input grid
    - derived from the input grid via transformation

Objects:
  - type: Subgrid
    identifier: 3x3 blocks of pixels
    properties:
      - location (top-left coordinate)
      - pixels (9 integer values)
      - corner_pixels (pixels at relative coordinates (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2))
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - location (row, column)

Relationships:
  - Input_Grid contains multiple potential 3x3 Subgrids.
  - Output_Grid is a transformation of Input_Grid.
  - The transformation depends on the corner_pixels of specific 3x3 Subgrids within the Input_Grid.

Actions:
  - Identify: Find all 3x3 Subgrids within the Input_Grid.
  - Filter: Select only those 3x3 Subgrids where none of the four corner_pixels have the background color (orange, 7).
  - Transform: For each selected 3x3 Subgrid, rotate its pixels 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
  - Compose: Construct the Output_Grid by applying the rotations to the selected Subgrids in their original locations and copying all other pixels directly from the Input_Grid.

Constants:
  - Background Color: orange (7)
  - Subgrid Size: 3x3
  - Rotation Angle: 90 degrees counter-clockwise
