            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Size:** The grid dimensions vary across examples but are consistent between the input and output of a single example (e.g., 7x7 in all provided examples).\n2.  **Background Color:** The color orange (7) appears frequently and seems to act as a background or neutral color, often remaining unchanged.\n3.  **Transformation Areas:** The changes between input and output occur within distinct, localized 3x3 square regions.\n4.  **Transformation Type:** Within these 3x3 regions, the pattern of pixels is altered. Comparing the input and output 3x3 blocks reveals a consistent 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.\n5.  **Identifying Regions:** The key challenge is determining *which* 3x3 regions are selected for rotation.\n    *   In `train_1`, two regions are rotated: one at the top-left corner (0,0) and one near the bottom-right (4,3).\n    *   In `train_2`, one region in the center (2,2) is rotated.\n    *   In `train_3`, two regions are rotated: one near the top-right (1,3) and one at the bottom-left (4,0).\n6.  **Selection Criteria:** Let's examine the properties of the rotated 3x3 blocks versus non-rotated ones. The background color orange (7) seems crucial. Observing the *corners* of the 3x3 blocks:\n    *   Rotated blocks (Examples 1, 2, 3): *None* of their four corner cells are orange (7).\n    *   Consider non-rotated 3x3 blocks: They invariably have at least one orange (7) pixel in a corner position. For instance, in `train_1`, the 3x3 block starting at (0,1) has orange corners at (0,3) and (2,3). The block starting at (1,1) has orange corners at (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), and (3,3).\n7.  **Conclusion:** The rule appears to be: identify all 3x3 subgrids whose four corner cells are *not* orange (7). Rotate each of these identified 3x3 subgrids 90 degrees counter-clockwise in place. Pixels outside these rotated blocks, or within blocks that don't meet the corner criteria, remain unchanged. The examples do not show overlapping selected regions, suggesting the transformation is applied independently to each qualifying region.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
