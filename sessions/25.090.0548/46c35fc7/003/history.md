Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Size:** The grid dimensions vary across examples but are consistent between the input and output of a single example (e.g., 7x7 in all provided examples).
2.  **Background Color:** The color orange (7) appears frequently and seems to act as a background or neutral color, often remaining unchanged.
3.  **Transformation Areas:** The changes between input and output occur within distinct, localized 3x3 square regions.
4.  **Transformation Type:** Within these 3x3 regions, the pattern of pixels is altered. Comparing the input and output 3x3 blocks reveals a consistent 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.
5.  **Identifying Regions:** The key challenge is determining *which* 3x3 regions are selected for rotation.
    *   In `train_1`, two regions are rotated: one at the top-left corner (0,0) and one near the bottom-right (4,3).
    *   In `train_2`, one region in the center (2,2) is rotated.
    *   In `train_3`, two regions are rotated: one near the top-right (1,3) and one at the bottom-left (4,0).
6.  **Selection Criteria:** Let's examine the properties of the rotated 3x3 blocks versus non-rotated ones. The background color orange (7) seems crucial. Observing the *corners* of the 3x3 blocks:
    *   Rotated blocks (Examples 1, 2, 3): *None* of their four corner cells are orange (7).
    *   Consider non-rotated 3x3 blocks: They invariably have at least one orange (7) pixel in a corner position. For instance, in `train_1`, the 3x3 block starting at (0,1) has orange corners at (0,3) and (2,3). The block starting at (1,1) has orange corners at (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), and (3,3).
7.  **Conclusion:** The rule appears to be: identify all 3x3 subgrids whose four corner cells are *not* orange (7). Rotate each of these identified 3x3 subgrids 90 degrees counter-clockwise in place. Pixels outside these rotated blocks, or within blocks that don't meet the corner criteria, remain unchanged. The examples do not show overlapping selected regions, suggesting the transformation is applied independently to each qualifying region.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input_Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  properties:
    - variable dimensions (height, width)
    - contains pixels with values 0-9 (colors)
    - has a predominant background color: orange (7)

Output_Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  properties:
    - same dimensions as the corresponding input grid
    - derived from the input grid via transformation

Objects:
  - type: Subgrid
    identifier: 3x3 blocks of pixels
    properties:
      - location (top-left coordinate)
      - pixels (9 integer values)
      - corner_pixels (pixels at relative coordinates (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2))
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - location (row, column)

Relationships:
  - Input_Grid contains multiple potential 3x3 Subgrids.
  - Output_Grid is a transformation of Input_Grid.
  - The transformation depends on the corner_pixels of specific 3x3 Subgrids within the Input_Grid.

Actions:
  - Identify: Find all 3x3 Subgrids within the Input_Grid.
  - Filter: Select only those 3x3 Subgrids where none of the four corner_pixels have the background color (orange, 7).
  - Transform: For each selected 3x3 Subgrid, rotate its pixels 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
  - Compose: Construct the Output_Grid by applying the rotations to the selected Subgrids in their original locations and copying all other pixels directly from the Input_Grid.

Constants:
  - Background Color: orange (7)
  - Subgrid Size: 3x3
  - Rotation Angle: 90 degrees counter-clockwise
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through all possible top-left corner positions (row `r`, column `c`) for a 3x3 subgrid within the input grid (i.e., `r` from 0 to height-3, `c` from 0 to width-3).
3.  For each potential 3x3 subgrid:
    a.  Examine its four corner pixels: at input grid coordinates (`r`, `c`), (`r`, `c+2`), (`r+2`, `c`), and (`r+2`, `c+2`).
    b.  Check if *none* of these four corner pixels have the background color (orange, 7).
    c.  If the condition in step 3b is met (all four corners are non-orange):
        i.  Extract the 3x3 block of pixels from the input grid starting at (`r`, `c`).
        ii. Perform a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation on this extracted 3x3 block.
        iii. Place the rotated 3x3 block into the output grid, starting at the same top-left corner position (`r`, `c`), overwriting the initially copied values.
4.  Return the modified output grid.

Okay, the metrics confirm the errors identified previously. The issue wasn't identifying *which* blocks to transform, but *how* to transform them. The size, color palette, and color counts were correct because the transformation was contained within the 3x3 blocks and simply rearranged existing colors. The errors came from the specific pixel values being incorrect after the transformation.## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the trigger condition for the transformation: 3x3 subgrids whose four corner cells are not orange (7). However, the transformation applied within these subgrids (a standard 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation) was incorrect, leading to errors in all examples.

The errors occurred specifically within the transformed 3x3 blocks. By comparing the input, expected output, and the incorrectly transformed output for these blocks, a new transformation pattern emerged: a combination of counter-clockwise rotation for corners/center and clockwise rotation for edges.

**Strategy:**
1.  Update the description of the transformation action to reflect the mixed rotation pattern (CCW for corners/center, CW for edges).
2.  Refine the Natural Language Program and YAML facts accordingly.
3.  The coder phase will need to implement this specific mixed rotation logic for the 3x3 blocks instead of using a simple `np.rot90`.

## Facts


```yaml
Input_Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  properties:
    - variable dimensions (height, width)
    - contains pixels with values 0-9 (colors)
    - has a predominant background color: orange (7)

Output_Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  properties:
    - same dimensions as the corresponding input grid
    - derived from the input grid via transformation

Objects:
  - type: Subgrid
    identifier: 3x3 block of pixels
    properties:
      - location (top-left coordinate)
      - pixels (9 integer values)
      - corner_pixels (pixels at relative coordinates (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2))
      - edge_pixels (pixels at relative coordinates (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1))
      - center_pixel (pixel at relative coordinate (1,1))
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - location (row, column)

Relationships:
  - Input_Grid contains multiple potential 3x3 Subgrids.
  - Output_Grid is a transformation of Input_Grid.
  - The transformation is triggered based on the corner_pixels of specific 3x3 Subgrids within the Input_Grid.
  - The transformation rule applies differently to corner/center pixels vs. edge pixels within the triggered Subgrids.

Actions:
  - Identify: Find all 3x3 Subgrids within the Input_Grid.
  - Filter: Select only those 3x3 Subgrids where none of the four corner_pixels have the background color (orange, 7).
  - Transform: For each selected 3x3 Subgrid:
      1. Create a new empty 3x3 block.
      2. Rotate the four corner_pixels and the center_pixel 90 degrees counter-clockwise and place them in the new block.
      3. Rotate the four edge_pixels 90 degrees clockwise and place them in the new block.
      4. This new block represents the transformed subgrid.
  - Compose: Construct the Output_Grid by applying the specific mixed rotations to the selected Subgrids in their original locations (overwriting the original pixels) and copying all other pixels directly from the Input_Grid.

Constants:
  - Background Color: orange (7)
  - Subgrid Size: 3x3
  - Rotation Type 1 (Corners/Center): 90 degrees counter-clockwise
  - Rotation Type 2 (Edges): 90 degrees clockwise
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Define the background color as orange (7).
3.  Iterate through all possible top-left corner positions (row `r`, column `c`) for a 3x3 subgrid within the input grid (ensuring the subgrid fits within the bounds: `r` from 0 to height-3, `c` from 0 to width-3).
4.  For each potential 3x3 subgrid starting at (`r`, `c`):
    a.  Check the colors of its four corner pixels: input grid coordinates (`r`, `c`), (`r`, `c+2`), (`r+2`, `c`), and (`r+2`, `c+2`).
    b.  If *none* of these four corner pixels are the background color (orange, 7):
        i.  Extract the 3x3 block of pixels from the input grid starting at (`r`, `c`). Let this be `input_block`.
        ii. Create a new, empty 3x3 block, let this be `output_block`.
        iii. Perform a 90-degree **counter-clockwise** rotation for the corner and center pixels:
            - `output_block[0,0] = input_block[0,2]`
            - `output_block[0,2] = input_block[2,2]`
            - `output_block[2,0] = input_block[0,0]`
            - `output_block[2,2] = input_block[2,0]`
            - `output_block[1,1] = input_block[1,1]`
        iv. Perform a 90-degree **clockwise** rotation for the edge pixels:
            - `output_block[0,1] = input_block[1,0]`
            - `output_block[1,0] = input_block[2,1]`
            - `output_block[1,2] = input_block[0,1]`
            - `output_block[2,1] = input_block[1,2]`
        v.  Place the completed `output_block` into the main output grid, starting at the same top-left corner position (`r`, `c`), overwriting the initially copied values.
5.  Return the final modified output grid.
