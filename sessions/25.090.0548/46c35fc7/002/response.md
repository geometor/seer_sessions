Okay, the metrics confirm the errors identified previously. The issue wasn't identifying *which* blocks to transform, but *how* to transform them. The size, color palette, and color counts were correct because the transformation was contained within the 3x3 blocks and simply rearranged existing colors. The errors came from the specific pixel values being incorrect after the transformation.## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the trigger condition for the transformation: 3x3 subgrids whose four corner cells are not orange (7). However, the transformation applied within these subgrids (a standard 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation) was incorrect, leading to errors in all examples.

The errors occurred specifically within the transformed 3x3 blocks. By comparing the input, expected output, and the incorrectly transformed output for these blocks, a new transformation pattern emerged: a combination of counter-clockwise rotation for corners/center and clockwise rotation for edges.

**Strategy:**
1.  Update the description of the transformation action to reflect the mixed rotation pattern (CCW for corners/center, CW for edges).
2.  Refine the Natural Language Program and YAML facts accordingly.
3.  The coder phase will need to implement this specific mixed rotation logic for the 3x3 blocks instead of using a simple `np.rot90`.

## Metrics from Previous Attempt

The provided results and the code execution confirm the following metrics for the previous attempt (which used simple counter-clockwise rotation):


```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(results):
    metrics = []
    for i, res in enumerate(results):
        inp = np.array(res['input'])
        expected = np.array(res['output'])
        transformed = np.array(res['transformed_output'])

        match = np.array_equal(expected, transformed)
        pixels_off = np.sum(expected != transformed)
        size_correct = inp.shape == expected.shape == transformed.shape

        palette_input = set(inp.flatten())
        palette_expected = set(expected.flatten())
        palette_transformed = set(transformed.flatten())
        palette_correct = palette_expected == palette_transformed

        counts_expected = {k: np.sum(expected == k) for k in palette_expected}
        counts_transformed = {k: np.sum(transformed == k) for k in palette_transformed}
        count_correct = counts_expected == counts_transformed

        metrics.append({

## Facts


```yaml
Input_Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  properties:
    - variable dimensions (height, width)
    - contains pixels with values 0-9 (colors)
    - has a predominant background color: orange (7)

Output_Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  properties:
    - same dimensions as the corresponding input grid
    - derived from the input grid via transformation

Objects:
  - type: Subgrid
    identifier: 3x3 block of pixels
    properties:
      - location (top-left coordinate)
      - pixels (9 integer values)
      - corner_pixels (pixels at relative coordinates (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2))
      - edge_pixels (pixels at relative coordinates (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1))
      - center_pixel (pixel at relative coordinate (1,1))
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - location (row, column)

Relationships:
  - Input_Grid contains multiple potential 3x3 Subgrids.
  - Output_Grid is a transformation of Input_Grid.
  - The transformation is triggered based on the corner_pixels of specific 3x3 Subgrids within the Input_Grid.
  - The transformation rule applies differently to corner/center pixels vs. edge pixels within the triggered Subgrids.

Actions:
  - Identify: Find all 3x3 Subgrids within the Input_Grid.
  - Filter: Select only those 3x3 Subgrids where none of the four corner_pixels have the background color (orange, 7).
  - Transform: For each selected 3x3 Subgrid:
      1. Create a new empty 3x3 block.
      2. Rotate the four corner_pixels and the center_pixel 90 degrees counter-clockwise and place them in the new block.
      3. Rotate the four edge_pixels 90 degrees clockwise and place them in the new block.
      4. This new block represents the transformed subgrid.
  - Compose: Construct the Output_Grid by applying the specific mixed rotations to the selected Subgrids in their original locations (overwriting the original pixels) and copying all other pixels directly from the Input_Grid.

Constants:
  - Background Color: orange (7)
  - Subgrid Size: 3x3
  - Rotation Type 1 (Corners/Center): 90 degrees counter-clockwise
  - Rotation Type 2 (Edges): 90 degrees clockwise
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Define the background color as orange (7).
3.  Iterate through all possible top-left corner positions (row `r`, column `c`) for a 3x3 subgrid within the input grid (ensuring the subgrid fits within the bounds: `r` from 0 to height-3, `c` from 0 to width-3).
4.  For each potential 3x3 subgrid starting at (`r`, `c`):
    a.  Check the colors of its four corner pixels: input grid coordinates (`r`, `c`), (`r`, `c+2`), (`r+2`, `c`), and (`r+2`, `c+2`).
    b.  If *none* of these four corner pixels are the background color (orange, 7):
        i.  Extract the 3x3 block of pixels from the input grid starting at (`r`, `c`). Let this be `input_block`.
        ii. Create a new, empty 3x3 block, let this be `output_block`.
        iii. Perform a 90-degree **counter-clockwise** rotation for the corner and center pixels:
            - `output_block[0,0] = input_block[0,2]`
            - `output_block[0,2] = input_block[2,2]`
            - `output_block[2,0] = input_block[0,0]`
            - `output_block[2,2] = input_block[2,0]`
            - `output_block[1,1] = input_block[1,1]`
        iv. Perform a 90-degree **clockwise** rotation for the edge pixels:
            - `output_block[0,1] = input_block[1,0]`
            - `output_block[1,0] = input_block[2,1]`
            - `output_block[1,2] = input_block[0,1]`
            - `output_block[2,1] = input_block[1,2]`
        v.  Place the completed `output_block` into the main output grid, starting at the same top-left corner position (`r`, `c`), overwriting the initially copied values.
5.  Return the final modified output grid.
