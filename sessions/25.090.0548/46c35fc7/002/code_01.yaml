Input_Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  properties:
    - variable dimensions (height, width)
    - contains pixels with values 0-9 (colors)
    - has a predominant background color: orange (7)

Output_Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  properties:
    - same dimensions as the corresponding input grid
    - derived from the input grid via transformation

Objects:
  - type: Subgrid
    identifier: 3x3 block of pixels
    properties:
      - location (top-left coordinate)
      - pixels (9 integer values)
      - corner_pixels (pixels at relative coordinates (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2))
      - edge_pixels (pixels at relative coordinates (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1))
      - center_pixel (pixel at relative coordinate (1,1))
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - location (row, column)

Relationships:
  - Input_Grid contains multiple potential 3x3 Subgrids.
  - Output_Grid is a transformation of Input_Grid.
  - The transformation is triggered based on the corner_pixels of specific 3x3 Subgrids within the Input_Grid.
  - The transformation rule applies differently to corner/center pixels vs. edge pixels within the triggered Subgrids.

Actions:
  - Identify: Find all 3x3 Subgrids within the Input_Grid.
  - Filter: Select only those 3x3 Subgrids where none of the four corner_pixels have the background color (orange, 7).
  - Transform: For each selected 3x3 Subgrid:
      1. Create a new empty 3x3 block.
      2. Rotate the four corner_pixels and the center_pixel 90 degrees counter-clockwise and place them in the new block.
      3. Rotate the four edge_pixels 90 degrees clockwise and place them in the new block.
      4. This new block represents the transformed subgrid.
  - Compose: Construct the Output_Grid by applying the specific mixed rotations to the selected Subgrids in their original locations (overwriting the original pixels) and copying all other pixels directly from the Input_Grid.

Constants:
  - Background Color: orange (7)
  - Subgrid Size: 3x3
  - Rotation Type 1 (Corners/Center): 90 degrees counter-clockwise
  - Rotation Type 2 (Edges): 90 degrees clockwise
