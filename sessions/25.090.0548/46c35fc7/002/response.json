            "text": "Okay, the metrics confirm the errors identified previously. The issue wasn't identifying *which* blocks to transform, but *how* to transform them. The size, color palette, and color counts were correct because the transformation was contained within the 3x3 blocks and simply rearranged existing colors. The errors came from the specific pixel values being incorrect after the transformation.## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the trigger condition for the transformation: 3x3 subgrids whose four corner cells are not orange (7). However, the transformation applied within these subgrids (a standard 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation) was incorrect, leading to errors in all examples.\n\nThe errors occurred specifically within the transformed 3x3 blocks. By comparing the input, expected output, and the incorrectly transformed output for these blocks, a new transformation pattern emerged: a combination of counter-clockwise rotation for corners/center and clockwise rotation for edges.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Update the description of the transformation action to reflect the mixed rotation pattern (CCW for corners/center, CW for edges).\n2.  Refine the Natural Language Program and YAML facts accordingly.\n3.  The coder phase will need to implement this specific mixed rotation logic for the 3x3 blocks instead of using a simple `np.rot90`.\n\n## Metrics from Previous Attempt\n\nThe provided results and the code execution confirm the following metrics for the previous attempt (which used simple counter-clockwise rotation):\n\n"
