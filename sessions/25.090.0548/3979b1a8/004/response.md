Okay, my manual counts were slightly off, but the resulting ranks R1, R2, R3 are the same as I assumed.
Ex 1: R1=3, R2=5, R3=2.
Ex 2: R1=8, R2=2, R3=9. (Tie breaking by value confirms R2=2, R3=9).

Let's re-verify the quadrants based on these exact ranks.
G1 (TL): Input. Correct.
G2 (TR): Swap(Input, R1, R2). Correct.
G3 (BL): Fill row `r` with color `Rank[(r % 3) + 1]` where ranks map {1:R1, 2:R2, 3:R3}? No, the sequence was [R3, R2, R1, R3, R2...]
Let rank_list = [R3, R2, R1]. Fill row `r` with `rank_list[r % 3]`.
*   Ex 1: rank_list = [2, 5, 3]. Rows: [2, 5, 3, 2, 5]. Matches BL.
*   Ex 2: rank_list = [9, 2, 8]. Rows: [9, 2, 8, 9, 2]. Matches BL.
This hypothesis for G3 (BL) holds.

G4 (BR): The final piece.
Could it be G4 = Swap(G3, R2, R3)?
*   Ex 1: G3 has rows [2, 5, 3, 2, 5]. Swap R2=5 and R3=2.
    *   Row 0 (all 2) -> becomes all 5. Expected BR row 0 is [5 5 3 2 5]. No.
*   Ex 2: G3 has rows [9, 2, 8, 9, 2]. Swap R2=2 and R3=9.
    *   Row 0 (all 9) -> becomes all 2. Expected BR row 0 is [2 2 8 9 2]. No.

Could it be G4 = Swap(G1, R2, R3)?
*   Ex 1: Swap(Input, R2=5, R3=2).
    
```
    Input:
    2 3 3 3 2
    3 3 5 3 3
    3 5 5 5 3
    3 3 5 3 3
    2 3 3 3 2
    Swap 5 and 2:
    5 3 3 3 5
    3 3 2 3 3
    3 2 2 2 3
    3 3 2 3 3
    5 3 3 3 5
    Expected BR:
    5 5 3 2 5
    5 3 3 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 5 5 5 3
    ```

    No.

How about rotating or flipping one of the other quadrants?
Rotate G1 (Input)? Rotate G2 (TR)? Rotate G3 (BL)?
Let's test rotating G3 (BL) 90 degrees clockwise.
*   Ex 1 G3:
    
```
    2 2 2 2 2
    5 5 5 5 5
    3 3 3 3 3
    2 2 2 2 2
    5 5 5 5 5
    ```

    Rotate 90 deg clockwise:
    
```
    5 2 3 5 2
    5 2 3 5 2
    5 2 3 5 2
    5 2 3 5 2
    5 2 3 5 2
    ```

    No.

Let's look at the structure again. Maybe BR is related to TR in a more complex way than a simple color swap.
*   Ex 1 TR: (R1=3 <-> R2=5 swap)
    
```
    2 5 5 5 2
    5 5 3 5 5
    5 3 3 3 5
    5 5 3 5 5
    2 5 5 5 2
    ```

*   Ex 1 BR:
    
```
    5 5 3 2 5
    5 3 3 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 5 5 5 3
    ```

Where is the R3 color (Red=2) coming from in BR? In TR, Red(2) only exists at the corners. In BR, Red(2) appears in the middle columns.
Where is the R1 color (Green=3) coming from in BR? In TR, Green(3) is where Gray(5) was in the input. In BR, Green(3) appears in cols 1, 2 and row 4.
Where is the R2 color (Gray=5) coming from in BR? In TR, Gray(5) is where Green(3) was in the input. In BR, Gray(5) is dominant.

Consider the possibility that the transformation for BR depends on the *ranks* of the colors in TR.
Let's calculate frequencies in TR (G2).
*   Ex 1 G2 (TR) Frequencies:
    *   Input counts: 3: 16, 5: 5, 2: 4
    *   G2 swaps 3 and 5. So, G2 counts should be: 5: 16, 3: 5, 2: 4.
    *   Ranks in G2: R1'=5, R2'=3, R3'=2. (Prime denotes ranks *within* G2).
*   Ex 2 G2 (TR) Frequencies:
    *   Input counts: 8: 16, 2: 5, 9: 4
    *   G2 swaps 8 and 2. So, G2 counts should be: 2: 16, 8: 5, 9: 4.
    *   Ranks in G2: R1'=2, R2'=8, R3'=9.

Now, could G4 (BR) be formed by swapping colors in G2 based on G2's ranks?
Hypothesis: G4 = Swap(G2, R1', R3')? (Swap most and least frequent in G2)
*   Ex 1: Swap R1'=5 and R3'=2 in G2.
    
```
    G2:
    2 5 5 5 2
    5 5 3 5 5
    5 3 3 3 5
    5 5 3 5 5
    2 5 5 5 2
    Swap 5 and 2:
    5 2 2 2 5
    2 2 3 2 2
    2 3 3 3 2
    2 2 3 2 2
    5 2 2 2 5
    Expected BR:
    5 5 3 2 5
    5 3 3 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 5 5 5 3
    ```

    No.

Hypothesis: G4 = Swap(G2, R2', R3')? (Swap 2nd and 3rd most frequent in G2)
*   Ex 1: Swap R2'=3 and R3'=2 in G2.
    
```
    G2:
    2 5 5 5 2
    5 5 3 5 5
    5 3 3 3 5
    5 5 3 5 5
    2 5 5 5 2
    Swap 3 and 2:
    3 5 5 5 3
    5 5 2 5 5
    5 2 2 2 5
    5 5 2 5 5
    3 5 5 5 3
    Expected BR:
    5 5 3 2 5
    5 3 3 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 5 5 5 3
    ```

    No. This was the original failed hypothesis, but based on ranks from Input, not G2. The result is different, but still wrong.

Let's look at the output grid holistically.
There's a relationship between TL(G1) and TR(G2) -> Swap(R1, R2).
There's a relationship between TL(G1) and BL(G3) -> Row fill using [R3, R2, R1] cycle based on input ranks.
Is there a relationship between TR(G2) and BR(G4)? Or maybe BL(G3) and BR(G4)? Or TL(G1) and BR(G4)?

Let's re-examine the failed code's output vs expected output.
Example 1 Failed Output (BR quadrant):

```
5 2 2 2 5
2 2 3 2 2
2 3 3 3 2
2 2 3 2 2
5 2 2 2 5
```

This was generated by `G4 = swap_colors(G2, R2, R3)` where R2=5, R3=2 are ranks from the *input*.

Example 1 Expected Output (BR quadrant):

```
5 5 3 2 5
5 3 3 2 5
5 3 2 2 5
5 3 2 2 5
5 5 5 5 3
```


Compare the failed BR and expected BR.
Failed has lots of R3(2), Expected has less R3(2).
Failed has R1(3) only where G2 had R1'(5). Expected has R1(3) in more places.
Failed has R2(5) only where G2 had R3'(2). Expected has lots of R2(5).

What if G4 (BR) is generated from G1 (Input) by swapping R1 and R3?
*   Ex 1: Swap R1=3 and R3=2 in Input.
    
```
    Input:
    2 3 3 3 2
    3 3 5 3 3
    3 5 5 5 3
    3 3 5 3 3
    2 3 3 3 2
    Swap 3 and 2:
    3 2 2 2 3
    2 2 5 2 2
    2 5 5 5 2
    2 2 5 2 2
    3 2 2 2 3
    Expected BR:
    5 5 3 2 5
    5 3 3 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 5 5 5 3
    ```

    No.

Okay, let's reconsider the previous code's logic:
G1 = Input
G2 = Swap(G1, R1, R2)
G3 = G2  <- This was wrong. Should be row fill.
G4 = Swap(G2, R2, R3) <- This was wrong.

Let's try the proposed logic structure:
G1 = Input
G2 = Swap(Input, R1, R2) # Ranks from Input
G3 = RowFill([R3, R2, R1]) # Ranks from Input
G4 = ???

What if G4 = Swap(G1, R1, R3)? No.
What if G4 = Swap(G1, R2, R3)? Tested above, no.
What if G4 = Swap(G2, R1, R3)? (Using Input ranks R1, R3 on G2)
*   Ex 1: Swap R1=3 and R3=2 in G2.
    
```
    G2:
    2 5 5 5 2
    5 5 3 5 5
    5 3 3 3 5
    5 5 3 5 5
    2 5 5 5 2
    Swap 3 and 2:
    3 5 5 5 3
    5 5 2 5 5
    5 2 2 2 5
    5 5 2 5 5
    3 5 5 5 3
    Expected BR:
    5 5 3 2 5
    5 3 3 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 5 5 5 3
    ```

    No.

What if G4 = Swap(G3, R1, R2)? (Using Input ranks R1, R2 on G3)
*   Ex 1: G3 (BL) has rows [2, 5, 3, 2, 5]. Swap R1=3 and R2=5.
    *   Row 0 (all 2) -> stays all 2. Expected BR row 0 is [5 5 3 2 5]. No.

What if G4 = Swap(G3, R1, R3)? (Using Input ranks R1, R3 on G3)
*   Ex 1: G3 (BL) has rows [2, 5, 3, 2, 5]. Swap R1=3 and R3=2.
    *   Row 0 (all 2) -> becomes all 3. Expected BR row 0 is [5 5 3 2 5]. No.

What if G4 = Swap(G3, R2, R3)? (Using Input ranks R2, R3 on G3)
*   Ex 1: G3 (BL) has rows [2, 5, 3, 2, 5]. Swap R2=5 and R3=2.
    *   Row 0 (all 2) -> becomes all 5. Expected BR row 0 is [5 5 3 2 5]. Possible match for first element.
    *   Row 1 (all 5) -> becomes all 2. Expected BR row 1 is [5 3 3 2 5]. No.

This is puzzling. Let's summarize the structure we are confident about:
Output is 2Hx2W.
TL = Input
TR = Swap(Input, R1, R2) (Ranks from Input, tie-break by value asc)
BL = RowFill using cyclic pattern [R3, R2, R1] (Ranks from Input)
BR = ???

Let's look at BR again, pixel by pixel, relating it to Input(r, c).
Ex 1: R1=3, R2=5, R3=2.
Input(0,0)=2(R3). BR(0,0)=5(R2).
Input(0,1)=3(R1). BR(0,1)=5(R2).
Input(0,2)=3(R1). BR(0,2)=3(R1).
Input(0,3)=3(R1). BR(0,3)=2(R3).
Input(0,4)=2(R3). BR(0,4)=5(R2).

Input(1,0)=3(R1). BR(1,0)=5(R2).
Input(1,1)=3(R1). BR(1,1)=3(R1).
Input(1,2)=5(R2). BR(1,2)=3(R1).
Input(1,3)=3(R1). BR(1,3)=2(R3).
Input(1,4)=3(R1). BR(1,4)=5(R2).

Input(2,0)=3(R1). BR(2,0)=5(R2).
Input(2,1)=5(R2). BR(2,1)=3(R1).
Input(2,2)=5(R2). BR(2,2)=2(R3).
Input(2,3)=5(R2). BR(2,3)=2(R3).
Input(2,4)=3(R1). BR(2,4)=5(R2).

Input(3,0)=3(R1). BR(3,0)=5(R2).
Input(3,1)=3(R1). BR(3,1)=3(R1).
Input(3,2)=5(R2). BR(3,2)=2(R3).
Input(3,3)=3(R1). BR(3,3)=2(R3).
Input(3,4)=3(R1). BR(3,4)=5(R2).

Input(4,0)=2(R3). BR(4,0)=5(R2).
Input(4,1)=3(R1). BR(4,1)=5(R2).
Input(4,2)=3(R1). BR(4,2)=5(R2).
Input(4,3)=3(R1). BR(4,3)=5(R2).
Input(4,4)=2(R3). BR(4,4)=3(R1).

Mapping Rule for BR(r, c) based on Input(r, c):
If Input(r, c) == R1 (3): BR color can be R2(5), R1(3), R3(2).
If Input(r, c) == R2 (5): BR color can be R1(3), R3(2).
If Input(r, c) == R3 (2): BR color can be R2(5), R1(3).

This doesn't seem like a simple mapping based only on the input color. Does the position (r, c) matter?
Maybe it depends on the color AND the row/column index?

Let's look at the colors that *change* from TR to BR in Ex 1.
TR -> BR changes:
(0,3): 5 -> 2 (R2 -> R3)
(1,1): 5 -> 3 (R2 -> R1)
(1,3): 5 -> 2 (R2 -> R3)
(2,2): 3 -> 2 (R1 -> R3)
(2,3): 3 -> 2 (R1 -> R3)
(3,1): 5 -> 3 (R2 -> R1)
(3,2): 3 -> 2 (R1 -> R3)
(3,3): 5 -> 2 (R2 -> R3)
(4,4): 2 -> 3 (R3 -> R1)

The colors changing are R1, R2, R3.
The resulting colors are R1, R3. R2 doesn't seem to be a result of a change.
R2 -> R3 (4 times)
R2 -> R1 (2 times)
R1 -> R3 (3 times)
R3 -> R1 (1 time)

Is there a pattern to *where* the changes occur?
Changes happen at: (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,4)

Let's try the same for Example 2.
R1=8, R2=2, R3=9.
TR (G2) = Swap(Input, R1, R2) = Swap(Input, 8, 2)
BR (G4) = Expected BR

Ex 2 TR (G2):

```
9 2 2 2 9
2 2 8 2 2
2 8 8 8 2
2 2 8 2 2
9 2 2 2 9
```

Ex 2 BR (G4):

```
2 2 8 9 2
2 8 8 9 2
8 8 9 9 2
9 9 9 2 2
2 2 2 2 8
```

TR -> BR changes:
(0,0): 9 -> 2 (R3 -> R2)
(0,3): 2 -> 9 (R2 -> R3)
(0,4): 9 -> 2 (R3 -> R2)
(1,1): 2 -> 8 (R2 -> R1)
(1,3): 2 -> 9 (R2 -> R3)
(2,0): 2 -> 8 (R2 -> R1)
(2,1): 8 -> 8 (R1 -> R1) - No change
(2,2): 8 -> 9 (R1 -> R3)
(2,3): 8 -> 9 (R1 -> R3)
(3,0): 2 -> 9 (R2 -> R3)
(3,1): 2 -> 9 (R2 -> R3)
(3,2): 8 -> 9 (R1 -> R3)
(3,3): 2 -> 2 (R2 -> R2) - No change
(4,0): 9 -> 2 (R3 -> R2)
(4,4): 9 -> 8 (R3 -> R1)

Summary of changes (Ex 2):
R3 -> R2 (3 times)
R2 -> R3 (4 times)
R2 -> R1 (2 times)
R1 -> R3 (3 times)
R3 -> R1 (1 time)

Okay, the changes themselves look complex. Maybe G4 is constructed independently, like G3?
G3 fills rows based on [R3, R2, R1] cycle.
What if G4 fills columns based on [R3, R2, R1] cycle?
*   Ex 1: R3=2, R2=5, R1=3. Cycle [2, 5, 3].
    *   Col 0: Fill with 2. Expected BR col 0 is [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]. No.
*   Ex 2: R3=9, R2=2, R1=8. Cycle [9, 2, 8].
    *   Col 0: Fill with 9. Expected BR col 0 is [2, 2, 8, 9, 2]. No.

Let's reconsider the relationship between the quadrants.
TL = Input
TR = Swap(Input, R1, R2)
BL = RowFill([R3, R2, R1])
BR = ???

Could BR = Swap(BL, R1, R2)?
*   Ex 1: BL rows are [2, 5, 3, 2, 5]. Swap R1=3 and R2=5.
    *   Row 0 (all 2) -> stays 2. Expected BR row 0: [5 5 3 2 5]. No.

Could BR = Swap(TR, R2, R3)? This was my first failed attempt for BR. Let's re-evaluate based on the correct BL.
*   Ex 1: Swap R2=5 and R3=2 in TR.
    
```
    TR:
    2 5 5 5 2
    5 5 3 5 5
    5 3 3 3 5
    5 5 3 5 5
    2 5 5 5 2
    Swap 5 and 2:
    5 2 2 2 5
    2 2 3 2 2
    2 3 3 3 2
    2 2 3 2 2
    5 2 2 2 5
    Expected BR:
    5 5 3 2 5
    5 3 3 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 5 5 5 3
    ```

    Still doesn't match.

Could BR = Transpose(BL)?
*   Ex 1 BL:
    
```
    2 2 2 2 2
    5 5 5 5 5
    3 3 3 3 3
    2 2 2 2 2
    5 5 5 5 5
    ```

    Transpose:
    
```
    2 5 3 2 5
    2 5 3 2 5
    2 5 3 2 5
    2 5 3 2 5
    2 5 3 2 5
    ```

    Expected BR:
    
```
    5 5 3 2 5
    5 3 3 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 5 5 5 3
    ```

    No.

Could BR = Transpose(TR)?
*   Ex 1 TR:
    
```
    2 5 5 5 2
    5 5 3 5 5
    5 3 3 3 5
    5 5 3 5 5
    2 5 5 5 2
    ```

    Transpose:
    
```
    2 5 5 5 2
    5 5 3 5 5
    5 3 3 3 5
    5 5 3 5 5
    2 5 5 5 2
    ```

    No (TR is symmetric in this case, but still doesn't match BR).

Let's step back. The four quadrants G1, G2, G3, G4.
G1 = Input
G2 = f(G1) = Swap(G1, R1, R2)
G3 = g(G1) = RowFill([R3, R2, R1])
G4 = h(G1, G2, G3)?

Maybe G4 combines elements from G1, G2, G3?
Or G4 = Swap(G2, X, Y) where X, Y depend on something else?

Consider the possibility that the rank order for BL was actually [R1, R2, R3] or something else.
Let's check [R1, R2, R3] cycle:
*   Ex 1: [3, 5, 2]. Rows: [3, 5, 2, 3, 5]. Expected BL rows: [2, 5, 3, 2, 5]. No.
Let's check [R2, R1, R3] cycle:
*   Ex 1: [5, 3, 2]. Rows: [5, 3, 2, 5, 3]. Expected BL rows: [2, 5, 3, 2, 5]. No.
Let's check [R2, R3, R1] cycle:
*   Ex 1: [5, 2, 3]. Rows: [5, 2, 3, 5, 2]. Expected BL rows: [2, 5, 3, 2, 5]. No.
Let's check [R3, R1, R2] cycle:
*   Ex 1: [2, 3, 5]. Rows: [2, 3, 5, 2, 3]. Expected BL rows: [2, 5, 3, 2, 5]. No.

It really seems like [R3, R2, R1] is the cycle for BL.

Is BR = Swap(TR, R1, R3)?
*   Ex 1: Swap R1=3 and R3=2 in TR.
    
```
    TR:
    2 5 5 5 2
    5 5 3 5 5
    5 3 3 3 5
    5 5 3 5 5
    2 5 5 5 2
    Swap 3 and 2:
    3 5 5 5 3
    5 5 2 5 5
    5 2 2 2 5
    5 5 2 5 5
    3 5 5 5 3
    Expected BR:
    5 5 3 2 5
    5 3 3 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 3 2 2 5
    5 5 5 5 3
    ```

    No.

Let's review the original prompt description:
Top-left and bottom-left quadrants are identical copies of the input grid. (Incorrect based on examples)
Top-right and bottom-right quadrants are modified versions... swap two specific colors... two most frequent. (Incorrect, BR is not just a swap).

My first attempt's code implemented:
TL = Input
TR = Swap(Input, R1, R2)
BL = Input
BR = Swap(Input, R1, R2)
This was clearly wrong based on the examples.

My second attempt's code implemented:
TL = Input
TR = Swap(Input, R1, R2)
BL = TR
BR = Swap(TR, R2, R3)
This also failed.

The refined hypothesis:
TL = Input (G1)
TR = Swap(Input, R1, R2) (G2)
BL = RowFill([R3, R2, R1]) (G3)
BR = ??? (G4)

What if BR is a swap applied to G3 (BL)?
BR = Swap(G3, R1, R3)?
*   Ex 1: G3 rows [2, 5, 3, 2, 5]. Swap R1=3 and R3=2.
    *   Row 0 (all 2) -> all 3. Expected BR: [5 5 3 2 5]. No.
BR = Swap(G3, R2, R3)?
*   Ex 1: G3 rows [2, 5, 3, 2, 5]. Swap R2=5 and R3=2.
    *   Row 0 (all 2) -> all 5. Expected BR: [5 5 3 2 5]. Match for row 0, col 0.
    *   Row 1 (all 5) -> all 2. Expected BR: [5 3 3 2 5]. No.
BR = Swap(G3, R1, R2)?
*   Ex 1: G3 rows [2, 5, 3, 2, 5]. Swap R1=3 and R2=5.
    *   Row 0 (all 2) -> all 2. Expected BR: [5 5 3 2 5]. No.

Okay, let's assume BR is Swap(TR, X, Y). Which colors X, Y?
We tested Swap(TR, R1, R2), Swap(TR, R1, R3), Swap(TR, R2, R3) using Input ranks. None worked.

What if the colors swapped for BR depend on the *row index* `r`?
No, that seems overly complex.

Look at Example 1 again.
Input: R1=3, R2=5, R3=2.
TL: Input
TR: Swap(Input, 3, 5)
BL: Rows = [2, 5, 3, 2, 5]
BR: ???

```
5 5 3 2 5
5 3 3 2 5
5 3 2 2 5
5 3 2 2 5
5 5 5 5 3
```

Let's try constructing BR from Input based on some combined logic.
Maybe BR(r, c) = function(Input(r, c), RowColorFromBL(r), ColColorFromTransposeBL(c))?
RowColor(r) for Ex 1: [2, 5, 3, 2, 5]
ColColor(c) for Ex 1: [2, 5, 3, 2, 5] (since BL transpose is like BL cols)

Consider BR(0, 0). Input(0,0)=2. RowColor=2. ColColor=2. Result=5.
Consider BR(0, 1). Input(0,1)=3. RowColor=2. ColColor=5. Result=5.
Consider BR(0, 2). Input(0,2)=3. RowColor=2. ColColor=3. Result=3.
Consider BR(1, 1). Input(1,1)=3. RowColor=5. ColColor=5. Result=3.
Consider BR(2, 2). Input(2,2)=5. RowColor=3. ColColor=3. Result=2.

This seems like a possibility. Need a rule.
Maybe BR(r, c) = Input(r, c) unless Input(r, c) == RowColor(r) or Input(r, c) == ColColor(c)? No.

Let's test `BR = Swap(TR, R1, R3)` again, very carefully.
Ex 1: R1=3, R2=5, R3=2. Swap 3 and 2 in TR.

```
TR:
2 5 5 5 2
5 5 3 5 5
5 3 3 3 5
5 5 3 5 5
2 5 5 5 2
Swap 3 and 2:
3 5 5 5 3  <- Row 0
5 5 2 5 5  <- Row 1
5 2 2 2 5  <- Row 2
5 5 2 5 5  <- Row 3
3 5 5 5 3  <- Row 4
Expected BR:
5 5 3 2 5  <- Row 0
5 3 3 2 5  <- Row 1
5 3 2 2 5  <- Row 2
5 3 2 2 5  <- Row 3
5 5 5 5 3  <- Row 4
```

No match.

Let's test `BR = Swap(TR, R2, R3)` again, very carefully.
Ex 1: R1=3, R2=5, R3=2. Swap 5 and 2 in TR.
