Determine the dimensions (H, W) of the input grid.\n2.  Analyze the input grid to find all unique colors and rank them by frequency (descending). Let the top three be R1, R2, R3. Ties are broken by lower color value first (e.g., if colors 2 and 5 both appear 10 times, and 2 < 5, then the one with value 2 gets the higher rank if they have the same count). Handle cases with fewer than 3 distinct colors gracefully.\n3.  Create the final output grid with dimensions 2H x 2W.\n4.  Top-Left Quadrant (G1): A direct copy of the input grid.\n5.  Top-Right Quadrant (G2): A copy of the input grid where the colors ranked R1 and R2 are swapped. If R2 does not exist (only one color present), G2 is identical to G1.\n6.  Bottom-Left Quadrant (G3): This quadrant is generated by filling rows cyclically. Row `r` is filled entirely with a single color determined by the sequence `[R3, R2, R1]` indexed by `r % 3`. If R3 or R2 do not exist, use R1 as a substitute in the sequence for that position.\n7.  Bottom-Right Quadrant (G4): Hypothesis: This quadrant is generated by taking G2 (the Top-Right quadrant) and swapping the colors ranked R2 and R3 (using the original ranks from the input grid). If R3 does not exist, G4 is identical to G2. If R2 does not exist, G4 is identical to G2. (Note: This rule for G4 is based on analysis but yielded incorrect results on test examples, indicating it might be inaccurate. It's included as the current best hypothesis).\n8.  Assemble the four quadrants (G1, G2, G3, G4) into the 2H x 2W output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef get_color_ranks(grid: np.ndarray):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates color frequencies in the grid and returns the colors \n    ranked R1 (most frequent), R2 (second most frequent), and R3 \n    (third most frequent).
