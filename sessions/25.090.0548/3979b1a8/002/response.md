**Example 1 Analysis (Colors by Freq: [3, 5, 2])**

*   Input (I)
*   Output (O)

Let C1=3 (most freq), C2=5 (2nd most), C3=2 (3rd most).

Let's examine the transformation pixel by pixel for each quadrant based on the *input* pixel color:

*   **Top-Left (TL):** I -> O
    *   Input 3 -> Output 3 (C1 -> C1)
    *   Input 5 -> Output 5 (C2 -> C2)
    *   Input 2 -> Output 2 (C3 -> C3)
    *   Rule: Identity transformation. Output = Input.

*   **Top-Right (TR):** I -> O
    *   Input 3 -> Output 5 (C1 -> C2)
    *   Input 5 -> Output 3 (C2 -> C1)
    *   Input 2 -> Output 2 (C3 -> C3)
    *   Rule: Swap C1 and C2. Keep C3 the same.

*   **Bottom-Left (BL):** I -> O
    *   Input 3 -> Output 2 (C1 -> C3)
    *   Input 5 -> Output 5 (C2 -> C2)
    *   Input 2 -> Output 3 ??? No, Input 2 -> Output 2 in BL. Let's re-check the BL quadrant from example 1.
    *   Expected BL:
        
```
        2 2 2 2 2
        5 5 5 5 5
        3 3 3 3 3
        2 2 2 2 2
        5 5 5 5 5
        ```

    *   Comparing Input and Expected BL:
        *   Input 2 -> Output 2 (C3 -> C3)
        *   Input 3 -> Output ? (Row 1: 3->2, Row 2: 3->5, Row 3: 3->3, Row 4: 3->2, Row 5: 3->5). This is not a simple color mapping.

Let's reconsider the structure. Maybe the quadrants aren't simple mappings.

Look at the output structure again:

Example 1 Output:

```
2 3 3 3 2 | 2 5 3 2 5
3 3 5 3 3 | 2 5 3 2 5
3 5 5 5 3 | 2 5 3 2 5
3 3 5 3 3 | 2 5 3 2 5
2 3 3 3 2 | 2 5 3 2 5
-----------+-----------
2 2 2 2 2 | 5 5 3 2 5
5 5 5 5 5 | 5 3 3 2 5
3 3 3 3 3 | 3 3 2 2 5
2 2 2 2 2 | 2 2 2 5 5
5 5 5 5 5 | 5 5 5 5 3
```


It seems the original hypothesis about copying the input to TL and BL was wrong for BL. And the TR/BR being identical swaps was also wrong.

**Let's try a different approach:** What if the transformation depends on the *rank* of the color frequency?

*   Most frequent (Rank 1)
*   Second most frequent (Rank 2)
*   Third most frequent (Rank 3)
*   etc.

**Example 1:** R1=3, R2=5, R3=2
**Example 2:** R1=8, R2=2, R3=9

Let's define a mapping function `Map(Quadrant, InputColor)` that returns the OutputColor.

**Example 1 (R1=3, R2=5, R3=2):**

*   `Map(TL, R1) = 3` (R1)
*   `Map(TL, R2) = 5` (R2)
*   `Map(TL, R3) = 2` (R3)
    => **TL maps Rk -> Rk** (Identity)

*   `Map(TR, R1) = 5` (R2)
*   `Map(TR, R2) = 3` (R1)
*   `Map(TR, R3) = 2` (R3)
    => **TR maps R1 <-> R2, Rk -> Rk for k>2** (Swap top 2)

*   `Map(BL, R1) = ?` -> Looking at Expected BL, Input 3 (R1) maps to 2 (R3) in row 1, 5 (R2) in row 2, 3 (R1) in row 3. This still looks inconsistent.

Could the transformation be simpler? Is the BL quadrant just the *input grid* transformed by mapping C1->C1, C2->C2, C3->C3? Let's check that.

*   Input 1:
    
```
    2 3 3 3 2
    3 3 5 3 3
    3 5 5 5 3
    3 3 5 3 3
    2 3 3 3 2
    ```

*   Expected BL:
    
```
    2 2 2 2 2
    5 5 5 5 5
    3 3 3 3 3
    2 2 2 2 2
    5 5 5 5 5
    ```

    No, these are clearly not the same.

**Let's step back and look at the *structure* again.**

*   The output is 2x2 the size of the input.
*   It looks like four grids are tiled together.

What are these four grids?
Grid 1 (TL) = Input
Grid 2 (TR) = Input with C1 <-> C2 swap
Grid 3 (BL) = ?
Grid 4 (BR) = ?

Let's analyze Grid 3 (BL) and Grid 4 (BR) more carefully, comparing them to the input.

**Example 1 (R1=3, R2=5, R3=2):**
*   Input (I):
    
```
    2 3 3 3 2
    3 3 5 3 3
    3 5 5 5 3
    3 3 5 3 3
    2 3 3 3 2
    ```

*   Grid 3 (BL):
    
```
    2 2 2 2 2
    5 5 5 5 5
    3 3 3 3 3
    2 2 2 2 2
    5 5 5 5 5
    ```

*   Grid 4 (BR):
    
```
    5 5 3 2 5
    5 3 3 2 5
    3 3 2 2 5
    2 2 2 5 5
    5 5 5 5 3
    ```


Is Grid 3 related to Grid 1 (Input)? No obvious pixel mapping.
Is Grid 4 related to Grid 1 (Input)? No obvious pixel mapping.
Is Grid 3 related to Grid 2 (TR)? Let's generate Grid 2 (TR) properly first.
*   Grid 2 (TR) = Input with 3 <-> 5 swap:
    
```
    2 5 5 5 2
    5 5 3 5 5
    5 3 3 3 5
    5 5 3 5 5
    2 5 5 5 2
    ```

    Comparing Grid 2 (TR) with Expected TR from the problem description:
    *   Code's TR (Correct swap):
        
```
        2 5 5 5 2
        5 5 3 5 5
        5 3 3 3 5
        5 5 3 5 5
        2 5 5 5 2
        ```

    *   Expected TR (From problem description):
        
```
        2 5 3 2 5
        2 5 3 2 5
        2 5 3 2 5
        2 5 3 2 5
        2 5 3 2 5
        ```

    *   Okay, my analysis of the *expected* TR was wrong earlier. The code actually performed the C1<->C2 swap correctly, but the *expected* TR was something different. Let me re-copy the expected output for example 1.

*   **Example 1 Expected Output:**
    
```
    2 3 3 3 2 | 2 5 5 5 2  (TL | TR)
    3 3 5 3 3 | 5 5 3 5 5
    3 5 5 5 3 | 5 3 3 3 5
    3 3 5 3 3 | 5 5 3 5 5
    2 3 3 3 2 | 2 5 5 5 2
    -----------+-----------
    2 5 5 5 2 | 5 2 2 2 5  (BL | BR)
    5 5 3 5 5 | 2 2 5 2 2
    5 3 3 3 5 | 2 5 5 5 2
    5 5 3 5 5 | 2 2 5 2 2
    2 5 5 5 2 | 5 2 2 2 5
    ```

    *Where did I get the previous 'Expected Output' from? Ah, I must have misread or miscopied it from the failed test output message.* Let me re-examine the failed test output message.

    *Test Output for Ex 1:*
    
```
    Input:
    [[2 3 3 3 2]
     [3 3 5 3 3]
     [3 5 5 5 3]
     [3 3 5 3 3]
     [2 3 3 3 2]]
    Expected Output:
    [[2 3 3 3 2 2 5 5 5 2]  <- This matches my latest interpretation for TL and TR
     [3 3 5 3 3 5 5 3 5 5]
     [3 5 5 5 3 5 3 3 3 5]
     [3 3 5 3 3 5 5 3 5 5]
     [2 3 3 3 2 2 5 5 5 2]
     [2 5 5 5 2 5 2 2 2 5]  <- BL | BR
     [5 5 3 5 5 2 2 5 2 2]
     [5 3 3 3 5 2 5 5 5 2]
     [5 5 3 5 5 2 2 5 2 2]
     [2 5 5 5 2 5 2 2 2 5]]
    Transformed Output:
    [[2 3 3 3 2 2 5 5 5 2] <- My code produced this TL|TR correctly
     [3 3 5 3 3 5 5 3 5 5]
     [3 5 5 5 3 5 3 3 3 5]
     [3 3 5 3 3 5 5 3 5 5]
     [2 3 3 3 2 2 5 5 5 2]
     [2 3 3 3 2 2 5 5 5 2] <- My code produced this BL|BR incorrectly
     [3 3 5 3 3 5 5 3 5 5]
     [3 5 5 5 3 5 3 3 3 5]
     [3 3 5 3 3 5 5 3 5 5]
     [2 3 3 3 2 2 5 5 5 2]]
    ```

    So, the code correctly computed the TL and TR quadrants (TL=Input, TR=Input with C1<->C2 swap). The error is in the BL and BR quadrants. The previous code simply copied Input to BL and the modified grid to BR. This is wrong.

Let's define the four component grids based on the *Expected Output*:
*   Grid 1 (TL) = Input
*   Grid 2 (TR) = Input with C1 <-> C2 swap (where C1, C2 are most frequent colors)
*   Grid 3 (BL) = ? (Rows 5-9, Cols 0-4 of Expected Output)
*   Grid 4 (BR) = ? (Rows 5-9, Cols 5-9 of Expected Output)

**Example 1 Expected Output Quadrants (R1=3, R2=5, R3=2):**
*   Grid 1 (TL):
    
```
    2 3 3 3 2
    3 3 5 3 3
    3 5 5 5 3
    3 3 5 3 3
    2 3 3 3 2
    ```

*   Grid 2 (TR): (Input with 3<->5 swap)
    
```
    2 5 5 5 2
    5 5 3 5 5
    5 3 3 3 5
    5 5 3 5 5
    2 5 5 5 2
    ```

*   Grid 3 (BL):
    
```
    2 5 5 5 2
    5 5 3 5 5
    5 3 3 3 5
    5 5 3 5 5
    2 5 5 5 2
    ```

    Wait, **Grid 3 (BL) == Grid 2 (TR)**!

*   Grid 4 (BR):
    
```
    5 2 2 2 5
    2 2 5 2 2
    2 5 5 5 2
    2 2 5 2 2
    5 2 2 2 5
    ```

    How is Grid 4 (BR) related to the others? Let's try applying another swap. What if we swap C1 and C3 (3 and 2)?
    *   Input with 3<->2 swap:
        
```
        3 2 2 2 3
        2 2 5 2 2
        2 5 5 5 2
        2 2 5 2 2
        3 2 2 2 3
        ```

        This is close to Grid 4 (BR), but the 3s became 5s, and the 5s became 2s.

    What if we swap C2 and C3 (5 and 2)?
    *   Input with 5<->2 swap:
        
```
        5 3 3 3 5
        3 3 2 3 3
        3 2 2 2 3
        3 3 2 3 3
        5 3 3 3 5
        ```

        Not matching.

    What if we take Grid 2 (TR) and apply a swap?
    *   Grid 2 (TR):
        
```
        2 5 5 5 2
        5 5 3 5 5
        5 3 3 3 5
        5 5 3 5 5
        2 5 5 5 2
        ```

    *   Swap C1 and C3 (3 and 2) on Grid 2:
        
```
        3 5 5 5 3  (2->3)
        5 5 2 5 5  (3->2)
        5 2 2 2 5  (3->2)
        5 5 2 5 5  (3->2)
        3 5 5 5 3  (2->3)
        ```

        Not matching Grid 4.

    *   Swap C2 and C3 (5 and 2) on Grid 2:
        
```
        5 2 2 2 5  (2->5, 5->2)
        2 2 3 2 2  (5->2)
        2 3 3 3 2  (5->2)
        2 2 3 2 2  (5->2)
        5 2 2 2 5  (2->5, 5->2)
        ```

        This looks like Grid 4 (BR)! **Grid 4 (BR) == Grid 2 (TR) with C2 <-> C3 swap.**

Let's verify this with Example 2.

**Example 2 (R1=8, R2=2, R3=9):**
*   Input (I):
    
```
    9 8 8 8 9
    8 8 2 8 8
    8 2 2 2 8
    8 8 2 8 8
    9 8 8 8 9
    ```

*   Grid 1 (TL) = Input - **CONFIRMED** by test results.
*   Grid 2 (TR) = Input with R1 <-> R2 swap (8 <-> 2)
    
```
    9 2 2 2 9
    2 2 8 2 2
    2 8 8 8 2
    2 2 8 2 2
    9 2 2 2 9
    ```

    - **CONFIRMED** by test results.
*   Grid 3 (BL): Is it equal to Grid 2 (TR)? Let's check the expected output for Example 2.
    *Expected Output Ex2:*
    
```
    9 8 8 8 9 | 9 2 2 2 9  (TL | TR)
    8 8 2 8 8 | 2 2 8 2 2
    8 2 2 2 8 | 2 8 8 8 2

        ```

        Yes, **Grid 3 (BL) == Grid 2 (TR)**. - **CONFIRMED**

*   Grid 4 (BR): Is it equal to Grid 2 (TR) with R2 <-> R3 swap (2 <-> 9)?
    *   Grid 2 (TR):
        
```
        9 2 2 2 9

        2 2 8 2 2
        9 2 2 2 9
        ```

    *   Swap 2 (R2) and 9 (R3) on Grid 2:
        
```
        2 9 9 9 2  (9->2, 2->9)
        9 9 8 9 9  (2->9)
        9 8 8 8 9  (2->9)
        9 9 8 9 9  (2->9)
        2 9 9 9 2  (9->2, 2->9)
        ```

    *   Expected Grid 4 (BR):

        9 9 8 9 9
        2 9 9 9 2
        ```

        Yes, **Grid 4 (BR) == Grid 2 (TR) with R2 <-> R3 swap**. - **CONFIRMED**

**New Confirmed Logic:**

1.  Find the colors present in the input grid and rank them by frequency (most frequent = R1, second = R2, third = R3, etc.). Handle cases with fewer than 3 colors.
2.  Create Grid 1 (G1) = Input grid.
3.  Create Grid 2 (G2) = Input grid with colors R1 and R2 swapped. If only one color exists, G2=G1.
4.  Create Grid 3 (G3) = Grid 2.
5.  Create Grid 4 (G4) = Grid 2 with colors R2 and R3 swapped. If fewer than 3 colors exist, handle appropriately:
    *   If only R1 exists, G4 = G2 (= G1).
    *   If only R1 and R2 exist, G4 = G2 (no R3 to swap with R2).
6.  Assemble the output grid:
    
```
    G1 | G2
    ---+---
    G3 | G4
    ```


This logic holds for both examples and explains the failed test results. The previous code failed because it assumed BL=G1 and BR=G2, instead of BL=G2 and BR=G4.

**Metrics Gathering:**
The color frequency analysis was already performed and used correctly to identify R1, R2, R3.

*   Example 1: R1=3, R2=5, R3=2
*   Example 2: R1=8, R2=2, R3=9

The key was understanding how these ranked colors were used in the transformations for each quadrant.

**YAML and NLP Update:**
Need to update the YAML facts and the Natural Language Program based on the new G1, G2, G3, G4 logic.**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the 2x2 tiling structure of the output and the role of color frequency. However, it incorrectly assumed the relationship between the input grid and the four output quadrants. The initial code implemented `TL=Input`, `TR=Modified`, `BL=Input`, `BR=Modified`, where `Modified` involved swapping the top two most frequent colors.

The failed test results show that while `TL=Input` and `TR=Input with C1<->C2 swap` are correct, the `BL` and `BR` quadrants follow different rules. By re-examining the expected outputs for the failed examples, a new pattern emerges: `BL = TR`, and `BR = TR` with a further swap between the 2nd and 3rd most frequent colors.

**Strategy:**

1.  Confirm the color frequency ranking for both examples.
2.  Define the transformations for the four grids (G1, G2, G3, G4) based on the frequency ranks (R1, R2, R3).
    *   G1 = Input (Identity)
    *   G2 = Input with R1 <-> R2 swap
    *   G3 = G2
    *   G4 = G2 with R2 <-> R3 swap (handling cases with < 3 colors)
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this new understanding.
4.  The subsequent coding phase will implement this revised logic.

**Revised Assessment based on Code Execution:**

The code execution confirms the relationships for G1, G2, and G3 for both examples.
*   G1 = Input
*   G2 = Input with R1 <-> R2 swap
*   G3 = G2

However, the relationship `G4 = G2 with R2 <-> R3 swap` holds for Example 2 but **fails** for Example 1.

Let's re-examine Example 1's G4 calculation.
*   R1=3, R2=5, R3=2
*   G2 (TR quadrant from expected):
    
```
    2 5 5 5 2
    5 5 3 5 5
    5 3 3 3 5
    5 5 3 5 5
    2 5 5 5 2
    ```

*   G4 (BR quadrant from expected):
    
```
    5 2 2 2 5
    2 2 5 2 2
    2 5 5 5 2
    2 2 5 2 2
    5 2 2 2 5
    ```

*   Applying R2 <-> R3 swap (5 <-> 2) to G2:
    *   Pixel value 2 becomes 5
    *   Pixel value 5 becomes 2
    *   Pixel value 3 remains 3
    
```
    5 2 2 2 5  # Matches G4[0]
    2 2 3 2 2  # G4[1] is [2 2 5 2 2] - Mismatch!
    2 3 3 3 2  # G4[2] is [2 5 5 5 2] - Mismatch!
    2 2 3 2 2  # G4[3] is [2 2 5 2 2] - Mismatch!
    5 2 2 2 5  # Matches G4[4]
    ```

The hypothesis `G4 = G2 with R2 <-> R3 swap` is incorrect.

Let's look at the transformations directly from Input to G4 for Example 1:
*   Input (I):
    
```
    2 3 3 3 2
    3 3 5 3 3
    3 5 5 5 3
    3 3 5 3 3
    2 3 3 3 2
    ```

*   G4 (BR):
    
```
    5 2 2 2 5
    2 2 5 2 2
    2 5 5 5 2
    2 2 5 2 2
    5 2 2 2 5
    ```

Mapping I -> G4:
*   Input 2 (R3) -> Output 5 (R2)
*   Input 3 (R1) -> Output 2 (R3)
*   Input 5 (R2) -> Output 5 (R2) ??? No, Input 5 maps to Output 5 in G4[1,2] and G4[2,1:4], but maps to Output 2 in G4[2,0]. Inconsistent mapping.

What if the swaps are applied sequentially?
*   Start = Input
*   Temp = Start with R1<->R2 swap (3<->5) -> This is G2/G3
    
```
    2 5 5 5 2
    5 5 3 5 5
    5 3 3 3 5
    5 5 3 5 5
    2 5 5 5 2
    ```

*   Result = Temp with R2<->R3 swap (5<->2) -> This is the one that failed above.
    
```
    5 2 2 2 5
    2 2 3 2 2
    2 3 3 3 2
    2 2 3 2 2
    5 2 2 2 5
    ```

    This doesn't match G4.

What if we swap R1<->R3 first?
*   Start = Input
*   Temp = Start with R1<->R3 swap (3<->2)
    
```
    3 2 2 2 3
    2 2 5 2 2
    2 5 5 5 2
    2 2 5 2 2
    3 2 2 2 3
    ```

*   Result = Temp with R1<->R2 swap (3<->5) - Apply to *original* R1/R2. Swap 3 and 5 in Temp.
    
```
    5 2 2 2 5  (3->5)
    2 2 3 2 2  (5->3)
    2 3 3 3 2  (5->3)
    2 2 3 2 2  (5->3)
    5 2 2 2 5  (3->5)
    ```

    Still not matching G4.

*   Result = Temp with R2<->R3 swap (5<->2) - Apply to *original* R2/R3. Swap 5 and 2 in Temp.
    
```
    3 5 5 5 3  (2->5)
    5 5 2 5 5  (2->5, 5->2)
    5 2 2 2 5  (2->5, 5->2)
    5 5 2 5 5  (2->5, 5->2)
    3 5 5 5 3  (2->5)
    ```

    Still not matching G4.

Let's rethink the quadrant definitions. Maybe the transformation isn't based *purely* on color frequency ranks applied uniformly to the whole grid.

Consider the colors C1, C2, C3 based on frequency rank. Define 4 mapping functions M1, M2, M3, M4 for the quadrants TL, TR, BL, BR respectively. Each function maps an input color to an output color.

Example 1: C1=3, C2=5, C3=2
Example 2: C1=8, C2=2, C3=9

*   **M1 (TL):** Ck -> Ck (Identity)
    *   Ex1: 3->3, 5->5, 2->2
    *   Ex2: 8->8, 2->2, 9->9
*   **M2 (TR):** C1<->C2, Ck->Ck for k>2
    *   Ex1: 3->5, 5->3, 2->2
    *   Ex2: 8->2, 2->8, 9->9
*   **M3 (BL):** Same as M2. C1<->C2, Ck->Ck for k>2
    *   Ex1: 3->5, 5->3, 2->2
    *   Ex2: 8->2, 2->8, 9->9
*   **M4 (BR):** ?
    *   Ex1: I->G4: 3(C1)->2(C3), 5(C2)->?, 2(C3)->5(C2)
    *   Ex2: I->G4: 8(C1)->9(C3), 2(C2)->2(C2), 9(C3)->8(C1)

Let's analyze M4:
*   Ex1: M4(C1)=C3, M4(C2)=?, M4(C3)=C2
*   Ex2: M4(C1)=C3, M4(C2)=C2, M4(C3)=C1

This looks like a *cyclic* shift for Example 1 (C1->C3->C2->C1 ?) and a swap for Example 2 (C1<->C3, C2->C2).

Let's check the pixel mappings for G4 again carefully.

Example 1 G4:
Input -> Output
2 (C3) -> 5 (C2)
3 (C1) -> 2 (C3)
5 (C2) -> Look at `Input[1,2]=5`. `G4[1,2]=5`. Look at `Input[2,1]=5`. `G4[2,1]=5`. Look at `Input[2,2]=5`. `G4[2,2]=5`. Look at `Input[2,3]=5`. `G4[2,3]=5`. It seems `5(C2) -> 5(C2)` generally. Where did the mismatch come from before? Ah, I was comparing `G4` to a modified `G2`. Let's stick to `Input -> G4`.

*   **M4 (BR) - Revised:**
    *   Ex1: I->G4: 3(C1)->2(C3), 5(C2)->5(C2), 2(C3)->5(C2). No, `Input[0,0]=2` maps to `G4[0,0]=5`. So `2(C3)->5(C2)`.
        Let's tabulate:
        Input Color | Output Color in G4
        -------------------------------
        2 (C3)      | 5 (C2)
        3 (C1)      | 2 (C3)
        5 (C2)      | 5 (C2) ??? Let's check Input[1,2]=5 -> G4[1,2]=5. OK. Input[2,1]=5 -> G4[2,1]=5. OK. Input[2,2]=5 -> G4[2,2]=5. OK. Input[2,3]=5 -> G4[2,3]=5. OK. Input[3,2]=5 -> G4[3,2]=5. OK.
        Okay, looks like M4 is: **C1 -> C3, C2 -> C2, C3 -> C2**

    *   Ex2: I->G4: 8(C1)->9(C3), 2(C2)->2(C2), 9(C3)->8(C1)
        Let's tabulate:
        Input Color | Output Color in G4
        -------------------------------
        8 (C1)      | 9 (C3)
        2 (C2)      | 2 (C2)
        9 (C3)      | 8 (C1)
        Okay, looks like M4 is: **C1 -> C3, C2 -> C2, C3 -> C1** (which is C1<->C3 swap)

So, the mapping for G4 depends on the example? That seems unlikely for ARC. There must be a single rule.

Let's retry the `G4 = G2 with R2 <-> R3 swap` for Ex1, paying close attention.
*   G2 (Ex1):
    
```
    2 5 5 5 2
    5 5 3 5 5
    5 3 3 3 5
    5 5 3 5 5
    2 5 5 5 2
    ```

*   G4 (Ex1):
    
```
    5 2 2 2 5
    2 2 5 2 2
    2 5 5 5 2
    2 2 5 2 2
    5 2 2 2 5
    ```

*   R2=5, R3=2. Swap 5 and 2 in G2.
    *   G2[0,0]=2 -> 5. G4[0,0]=5. Match.
    *   G2[0,1]=5 -> 2. G4[0,1]=2. Match.
    *   G2[0,2]=5 -> 2. G4[0,2]=2. Match.
    *   G2[0,3]=5 -> 2. G4[0,3]=2. Match.
    *   G2[0,4]=2 -> 5. G4[0,4]=5. Match.
    *   G2[1,0]=5 -> 2. G4[1,0]=2. Match.
    *   G2[1,1]=5 -> 2. G4[1,1]=2. Match.
    *   G2[1,2]=3 -> 3. G4[1,2]=5. **MISMATCH**. Where did `G4[1,2]=5` come from? It should be `3` if the rule was `G2 + (R2<->R3)`.
    *   Let me re-re-check the expected output G4 for Ex1.

    Expected Output (from test failure message):
    
```
    [[2 3 3 3 2 2 5 5 5 2]
     [3 3 5 3 3 5 5 3 5 5]
     [3 5 5 5 3 5 3 3 3 5]
     [3 3 5 3 3 5 5 3 5 5]
     [2 3 3 3 2 2 5 5 5 2]
     [2 5 5 5 2 5 2 2 2 5]  <- G3 | G4 start here
     [5 5 3 5 5 2 2 5 2 2]
     [5 3 3 3 5 2 5 5 5 2]
     [5 5 3 5 5 2 2 5 2 2]
     [2 5 5 5 2 5 2 2 2 5]]
    ```

    So G4 is indeed:
    
```
    5 2 2 2 5
    2 2 5 2 2  <- G4[1,2] is 5
    2 5 5 5 2  <- G4[2,1], G4[2,2], G4[2,3], G4[2,4] are 5,5,5,2
    2 2 5 2 2  <- G4[3,2] is 5
    5 2 2 2 5
    ```

    Okay, the hypothesis `G4 = G2 with R2 <-> R3 swap` is definitively wrong for Example 1.

Let's try the mapping approach again, very carefully.
Map M4: Input -> G4 (Ex1: R1=3, R2=5, R3=2)
Input | G4 Output | Mapping
------|-----------|----------
2 (R3)| 5 (R2)    | R3 -> R2
3 (R1)| 2 (R3)    | R1 -> R3
5 (R2)| 5 (R2)    | R2 -> R2 (e.g. Input[1,2]=5 -> G4[1,2]=5)
        | 2 (R3)    | R2 -> R3 (e.g. Input[2,1]=5 -> G4[2,1]=2 - Wait, G4[2,1] is 5!)

I am fundamentally misreading the G4 grid or the mapping. Let's write down Input and G4 side-by-side for Ex1.
Input (I)              G4 (BR)

```                  ```

2 3 3 3 2            5 2 2 2 5
3 3 5 3 3            2 2 5 2 2
3 5 5 5 3            2 5 5 5 2
3 3 5 3 3            2 2 5 2 2
2 3 3 3 2            5 2 2 2 5

```                 ```

(0,0): I=2 -> G4=5 (R3->R2)
(0,1): I=3 -> G4=2 (R1->R3)
(1,2): I=5 -> G4=5 (R2->R2)
(2,1): I=5 -> G4=5 (R2->R2)
(2,2): I=5 -> G4=5 (R2->R2)

Mapping M4 (Ex1): **R1 -> R3, R2 -> R2, R3 -> R2**

Mapping M4 (Ex2: R1=8, R2=2, R3=9):
Input (I)              G4 (BR)

```                  ```

9 8 8 8 9            2 9 9 9 2
8 8 2 8 8            9 9 8 9 9
8 2 2 2 8            9 8 8 8 9
8 8 2 8 8            9 9 8 9 9
9 8 8 8 9            2 9 9 9 2

```                 ```

(0,0): I=9 -> G4=2 (R3->R2) ?? No, G4[0,0]=2 is R2. Input 9 is R3. So R3 -> R2.
(0,1): I=8 -> G4=9 (R1->R3)
(1,2): I=2 -> G4=8 (R2->R1)
(2,1): I=2 -> G4=8 (R2->R1)

Mapping M4 (Ex2): **R1 -> R3, R2 -> R1, R3 -> R2**

Okay, the mapping M4 is *different* for the two examples.
Ex1: R1->R3, R2->R2, R3->R2
Ex2: R1->R3, R2->R1, R3->R2

This seems like a cyclic shift `R1 -> R3 -> R2 -> R1` for Ex2, and `R1 -> R3 -> R2` (with R2 mapping to itself?) for Ex1.

Could it be related to the *number* of distinct colors?
Ex1 has 3 colors. Ex2 has 3 colors. That doesn't help.

Let's redefine the structure:
Output = Tile([G1, G2], [G3, G4])
G1 = M1(Input)
G2 = M2(Input)
G3 = M3(Input)
G4 = M4(Input)

Mappings based on Frequency Ranks (R1, R2, R3):
M1: Rk -> Rk (Identity)
M2: R1<->R2, Rk->Rk for k>2
M3: R1<->R2, Rk->Rk for k>2 (Same as M2)
M4:
  Ex1: R1->R3, R2->R2, R3->R2
  Ex2: R1->R3, R2->R1, R3->R2

There must be a single rule for M4. What is the difference between Ex1 and Ex2 that causes this?
Ranks:
Ex1: [3, 5, 2]
Ex2: [8, 2, 9]

Maybe it's not about ranks but specific colors? No, ARC avoids specific color values.

Is it possible M3 is NOT equal to M2?
Let's check Input -> G3 (BL) for Ex1:
Input (I)              G3 (BL)

```                  ```

2 3 3 3 2            2 5 5 5 2
3 3 5 3 3            5 5 3 5 5
3 5 5 5 3            5 3 3 3 5
3 3 5 3 3            5 5 3 5 5
2 3 3 3 2            2 5 5 5 2

```                 ```

Mapping M3 (Ex1):
2 (R3) -> 2 (R3)
3 (R1) -> 5 (R2)
5 (R2) -> 3 (R1)
Rule: **R1 -> R2, R2 -> R1, R3 -> R3** (This is R1<->R2 swap, matching M2) - CONFIRMED

Check Input -> G3 (BL) for Ex2:
Input (I)              G3 (BL)

```                  ```

9 8 8 8 9            9 2 2 2 9
8 8 2 8 8            2 2 8 2 2
8 2 2 2 8            2 8 8 8 2
8 8 2 8 8            2 2 8 2 2
9 8 8 8 9            9 2 2 2 9

```                 ```

Mapping M3 (Ex2):
8 (R1) -> 2 (R2)
2 (R2) -> 8 (R1)
9 (R3) -> 9 (R3)
Rule: **R1 -> R2, R2 -> R1, R3 -> R3** (This is R1<->R2 swap, matching M2) - CONFIRMED

So M1, M2, M3 are consistently defined using R1, R2, R3 ranks. The problem is M4.

Let's assume M4 *is* consistent. Which rule fits both?
Rule A: R1->R3, R2->R2, R3->R2 (Fits Ex1) -> Apply to Ex2: 8->9, 2->2, 9->2. G4 should be input with this map.
Input:             G4 if Rule A:

```                ```

9 8 8 8 9          2 9 9 9 2
8 8 2 8 8          9 9 2 9 9

Actual G4 (Ex2):

```
2 9 9 9 2
9 9 8 9 9  <- Mismatch at [1,2] (Input 2 -> Actual G4 8; Rule A gives 2)
9 8 8 8 9  <- Mismatch at [2,1],[2,2],[2,3] (Input 2 -> Actual G4 8; Rule A gives 2)
9 9 8 9 9  <- Mismatch at [3,2] (Input 2 -> Actual G4 8; Rule A gives 2)
2 9 9 9 2
```

Rule A fails for Ex2.

Rule B: R1->R3, R2->R1, R3->R2 (Fits Ex2) -> Apply to Ex1: 3->2, 5->3, 2->5. G4 should be input with this map.
Input:             G4 if Rule B:

```                ```

2 3 3 3 2          5 2 2 2 5

Actual G4 (Ex1):

```

2 2 5 2 2  <- Mismatch at [1,2] (Input 5 -> Actual G4 5; Rule B gives 3)
2 5 5 5 2  <- Mismatch at [2,1],[2,2],[2,3] (Input 5 -> Actual G4 5; Rule B gives 3)
2 2 5 2 2  <- Mismatch at [3,2] (Input 5 -> Actual G4 5; Rule B gives 3)
5 2 2 2 5
```

Rule B fails for Ex1.

There is no single, simple color mapping M4(Input) -> G4 based on frequency ranks R1, R2, R3 that works for both examples.

What else could determine the transformation?
Maybe M4 depends on M2? i.e. G4 = M4'(G2)?
Let's test G4 = (G2 with R1<->R3 swap). Ranks relative to original input.
Ex1: Swap R1(3) and R3(2) in G2.
G2 (Ex1):          G4 if G2+(R1<->R3):

```                ```

2 5 5 5 2          3 5 5 5 3
5 5 3 5 5          5 5 2 5 5
5 3 3 3 5          5 2 2 2 5
5 5 3 5 5          5 5 2 5 5
2 5 5 5 2          3 5 5 5 3

```                ```

Actual G4 (Ex1):

```
5 2 2 2 5
2 2 5 2 2
2 5 5 5 2
2 2 5 2 2
5 2 2 2 5
```

Fails.

Let's test G4 = (G2 with R2<->R3 swap). Ranks relative to original input. (This was tested by code execution and failed Ex1, passed Ex2).

Let's test G4 = (G2 with R1<->R2 swap). Ranks relative to original input. (This would transform G2 back to G1/Input). Fails.

What if the ranks are recalculated for G2?
G2 Colors (Ex1): 2, 3, 5. Freqs in G2: 5(R1')=16, 2(R2')=5, 3(R3')=4. Ranks R1'=5, R2'=2, R3'=3.
G2 Colors (Ex2): 2, 8, 9. Freqs in G2: 2(R1')=16, 9(R2')=5, 8(R3')=4. Ranks R1'=2, R2'=9, R3'=8.

Now try G4 = (G2 with R1'<->R2' swap).
Ex1: Swap 5 and 2 in G2. (This is the same as G2 with original R2<->R3 swap). Failed.
Ex2: Swap 2 and 9 in G2.
G2 (Ex2):          G4 if G2+(R1'<->R2'):

```                ```

9 2 2 2 9          2 9 9 9 2
2 2 8 2 2          9 9 8 9 9
2 8 8 8 2          9 8 8 8 9
2 2 8 2 2          9 9 8 9 9
9 2 2 2 9          2 9 9 9 2

```                ```

Actual G4 (Ex2):

```
2 9 9 9 2
9 9 8 9 9
9 8 8 8 9
9 9 8 9 9
2 9 9 9 2
```

This **matches** G4 for Example 2!

Let's re-test G4 = (G2 with R1'<->R2' swap) for Ex1.
R1'=5, R2'=2. Swap 5 and 2 in G2.
G2 (Ex1):          G4 if G2+(R1'<->R2'):

```                ```

2 5 5 5 2          5 2 2 2 5
5 5 3 5 5          2 2 3 2 2
5 3 3 3 5          2 3 3 3 2
5 5 3 5 5          2 2 3 2 2
2 5 5 5 2          5 2 2 2 5

```                ```

Actual G4 (Ex1):

```
5 2 2 2 5
2 2 5 2 2  <- Mismatch
2 5 5 5 2  <- Mismatch
2 2 5 2 2  <- Mismatch
5 2 2 2 5
```

Still fails for Ex1.

**Final Hypothesis Attempt:**

The process involves creating intermediate grids based on color frequency ranks *of the input*.
R1, R2, R3 = colors ranked by frequency in Input.
G1 = Input
G2 = Input with R1<->R2 swap
G3 = Input with R1<->R3 swap
G4 = Input with R2<->R3 swap

Let's test this.
Ex1: R1=3, R2=5, R3=2
G1 = Input. OK.
G2 = Input with 3<->5 swap. OK (matches TR).
G3 = Input with 3<->2 swap.
   
```
   3 2 2 2 3
   2 2 5 2 2
   2 5 5 5 2
   2 2 5 2 2
   3 2 2 2 3
   ```

   Actual BL is G2. So this G3 definition is wrong.
G4 = Input with 5<->2 swap.
   
```
   5 3 3 3 5
   3 3 2 3 3
   3 2 2 2 3
   3 3 2 3 3
   5 3 3 3 5
   ```

   Actual BR is different. So this G4 definition is wrong.

Okay, let's trust the first confirmed parts:
TL = G1 = Input
TR = G2 = Input with R1<->R2 swap
BL = G3 = G2

Only G4 (BR) is the mystery. And it must be derivable from Input, G2, and the color ranks R1, R2, R3.

Look at the mappings Input -> G4 again:
Ex1: M4: R1->R3, R2->R2, R3->R2
Ex2: M4: R1->R3, R2->R1, R3->R2

What single operation involving R1, R2, R3 transforms Input to G4 consistently?
It seems related to swapping R1 and R3, but R2's behavior is weird.

Could G4 = G3 with some swap? G3=G2. So G4 = G2 with some swap.
We tested G4 = G2 + (R1<->R2 swap) -> G1 (Incorrect)
We tested G4 = G2 + (R1<->R3 swap) -> Failed Ex1
We tested G4 = G2 + (R2<->R3 swap) -> Failed Ex1, Passed Ex2

This suggests the swap for G4 *might* depend on the relative frequencies or counts, or maybe the specific rank values?

What if the swap for G4 involves the *least* frequent color? R_last.
Ex1: Ranks = [3, 5, 2]. R1=3, R2=5, R_last=2. Swap R1 and R_last? (3<->2)
   G4 = Input + (R1<->R_last swap)?
   
```
   3 2 2 2 3
   2 2 5 2 2
   2 5 5 5 2
   2 2 5 2 2
   3 2 2 2 3
   ```

   Doesn't match G4.
   G4 = Input + (R2<->R_last swap)? (5<->2)
   
```
   5 3 3 3 5
   3 3 2 3 3
   3 2 2 2 3
   3 3 2 3 3
   5 3 3 3 5
   ```

   Doesn't match G4.

What if G4 = G2 + (R1 <-> R_last swap)? R1=3, R_last=2. Swap 3 and 2 in G2.
G2 (Ex1):          G4 if G2+(R1<->R_last):

```                ```

2 5 5 5 2          3 5 5 5 3
5 5 3 5 5          5 5 2 5 5
5 3 3 3 5          5 2 2 2 5
5 5 3 5 5          5 5 2 5 5
2 5 5 5 2          3 5 5 5 3

```                ```

Still doesn't match G4.

What if G4 = G2 + (R2 <-> R_last swap)? R2=5, R_last=2. Swap 5 and 2 in G2. (This is the R2<->R3 swap, which failed Ex1).

**Possibility:** The description or my interpretation of the expected output is flawed. Let's assume the logic *should* be consistent. The `G4 = G2 + (R2<->R3 swap)` worked for Ex2. Why did it fail for Ex1? Let's re-run that transformation manually.

Ex1: R1=3, R2=5, R3=2.
G2 = Input + (3<->5 swap):

```
2 5 5 5 2
5 5 3 5 5
5 3 3 3 5
5 5 3 5 5
2 5 5 5 2
```

Transform G2 with (R2<->R3 swap), i.e. (5<->2 swap):
G2 value | Becomes
---------|--------
2        | 5
5        | 2
3        | 3

Applying to G2:
