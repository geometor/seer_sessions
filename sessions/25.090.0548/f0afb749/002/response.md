**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the 2x scaling factor and the transformation rule for non-white pixels. However, it oversimplified the rule for white (0) pixels, applying the blue/white diagonal pattern (`[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`) universally. The comparison between the expected and transformed outputs reveals that the transformation for white pixels is conditional. Specifically, the blue/white pattern is applied only to *some* white pixels, while others are transformed into a solid white block (`[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`).

**Strategy for Resolution:**

The strategy is to refine the condition that determines which transformation rule applies to white input pixels. By analyzing the input grids and the corresponding expected outputs, particularly focusing on the white pixels that transform differently, we can deduce the specific condition. The analysis suggests that the transformation depends on the *orthogonal neighbors* of the white pixel in the input grid.

1.  **Re-analyze White Pixel Transformations:** Compare the input locations of white pixels with their corresponding 2x2 output blocks in the expected outputs for all examples.
2.  **Identify the Differentiating Factor:** Determine what distinguishes white pixels that map to `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` from those that map to `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`.
3.  **Test Hypothesis:** Formulate a hypothesis based on
