Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples consist of an input grid and an output grid of identical dimensions (10 rows, 8 columns).
2.  **Color Palette:**
    *   Example `train_1` uses colors: Yellow (4), Red (2), Magenta (6), Gray (5). The output uses the same set of colors.
    *   Example `train_2` uses colors: White (0), Yellow (4), Green (3), Maroon (9). The output uses the same set of colors.
3.  **Transformation Locality:** The changes seem to happen on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The output color of a pixel at `(row, col)` appears dependent on its original input color and its column index `col`.
4.  **Column Dependency:** The rule for changing a color seems to vary depending on the column the pixel resides in. For instance:
    *   In `train_1`: Yellow (4) in columns 0 or 1 becomes Magenta (6), but Yellow (4) in column 2 remains Yellow (4), Yellow (4) in columns 3 or 4 becomes Gray (5), Yellow (4) in column 5 remains Yellow (4), and Yellow (4) in column 6 becomes Red (2).
    *   In `train_2`: White (0) in columns 0, 1, or 2 becomes Green (3), but White (0) in column 3 or 5 remains White (0), White (0) in column 4 becomes Maroon (9), and White (0) in columns 6 or 7 becomes Yellow (4).
5.  **Rule Inconsistency:** The specific color substitution rules derived from `train_1` are different from those derived from `train_2`. For example, Yellow(4) is treated differently in column 0 between the two examples (changes to Magenta(6) in train_1, stays Yellow(4) in train_2). This suggests that either these two examples represent *different* tasks, or there is a higher-level rule determining *which* column-dependent substitution map to apply, possibly based on some global property of the input grid (though this is not immediately obvious). The core observed pattern in *both* is column-dependent substitution.
6.  **Object Integrity:** There's no clear preservation of "objects" (contiguous areas of the same color). The transformation slices through objects based on column lines.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True
  - height: 10
  - width: 8
transformation_type: pixel_wise_substitution
substitution_rule:
  type: column_dependent
  determinants:
    - input_pixel_color
    - input_pixel_column_index
  granularity: per_pixel
rule_consistency_across_examples:
  observation: The specific color mapping rules derived from train_1 differ from those derived from train_2.
  implication: Examples might be from different tasks, or a more complex meta-rule exists.
color_palette:
  train_1: [2, 4, 5, 6] # Red, Yellow, Gray, Magenta
  train_2: [0, 3, 4, 9] # White, Green, Yellow, Maroon
objects:
  - role: Pixels are the primary elements.
  - object_integrity: Not preserved; transformation applies based on column position regardless of object boundaries.
actions:
  - Color substitution based on column index and original color.
relationships:
  - Output color at (r, c) depends on Input color at (r, c) and the column index c.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Define a mapping (a set of rules) that specifies, for certain combinations of an input color and a column index, what the output color should be.
    *   *(Self-Correction/Refinement based on inconsistency): This mapping must be determined by analyzing the specific task's training examples. The observation that `train_1` and `train_2` yield different mappings suggests they either belong to different tasks or a meta-rule selects the mapping based on input grid properties. Assuming a single task context for now, deriving this mapping is the primary challenge.*
3.  For each cell in the input grid, identified by its row `r` and column `c`:
    a.  Get the input color `in_color` at `(r, c)`.
    b.  Check the defined mapping: Does any rule specify an output color for `in_color` when it appears in column `c`?
    c.  If a rule exists for the pair (`in_color`, `c`), place the corresponding output color into the output grid at `(r, c)`.
    d.  If no specific rule exists in the mapping for this `in_color` in column `c`, place the original `in_color` into the output grid at `(r, c)`.
4.  Return the fully populated output grid.
