"""
Transforms the input grid based on a pixel-wise substitution rule that depends on both the original color of the pixel and its column index. 

The specific color substitution mapping is derived by observing the changes between the input and output grids in the provided training examples for a given task. For each column, a mapping is determined that dictates how specific input colors in that column should change in the output. If no specific change rule is found for a color in a particular column, the color remains unchanged.

Note: The implementation below uses a hardcoded mapping derived specifically from the 'train_1' example. In a general ARC solver context, this mapping would need to be dynamically derived from the training examples associated with the specific task instance being solved.
