"""
Transforms the input grid based on a pixel-wise substitution rule that depends 
on the pixel's original color and its column index. The specific set of rules 
(the substitution map) used for the transformation is determined by the unique 
set of colors present in the entire input grid.

Two distinct substitution maps have been identified from the training examples:
- Map A is used if the input grid's unique colors are {Red(2), Yellow(4), Gray(5), Magenta(6)}.
- Map B is used if the input grid's unique colors are {White(0), Green(3), Yellow(4), Maroon(9)}.

Each map defines, for specific columns, how certain input colors should be 
changed to output colors. If a color in a column does not have an explicit rule 
in the selected map, it remains unchanged.
