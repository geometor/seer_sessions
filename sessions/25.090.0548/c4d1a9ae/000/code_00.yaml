task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True
  - height: 10
  - width: 8
transformation_type: pixel_wise_substitution
substitution_rule:
  type: column_dependent
  determinants:
    - input_pixel_color
    - input_pixel_column_index
  granularity: per_pixel
rule_consistency_across_examples:
  observation: The specific color mapping rules derived from train_1 differ from those derived from train_2.
  implication: Examples might be from different tasks, or a more complex meta-rule exists.
color_palette:
  train_1: [2, 4, 5, 6] # Red, Yellow, Gray, Magenta
  train_2: [0, 3, 4, 9] # White, Green, Yellow, Maroon
objects:
  - role: Pixels are the primary elements.
  - object_integrity: Not preserved; transformation applies based on column position regardless of object boundaries.
actions:
  - Color substitution based on column index and original color.
relationships:
  - Output color at (r, c) depends on Input color at (r, c) and the column index c.
