            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples consist of an input grid and an output grid of identical dimensions (10 rows, 8 columns).\n2.  **Color Palette:**\n    *   Example `train_1` uses colors: Yellow (4), Red (2), Magenta (6), Gray (5). The output uses the same set of colors.\n    *   Example `train_2` uses colors: White (0), Yellow (4), Green (3), Maroon (9). The output uses the same set of colors.\n3.  **Transformation Locality:** The changes seem to happen on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The output color of a pixel at `(row, col)` appears dependent on its original input color and its column index `col`.\n4.  **Column Dependency:** The rule for changing a color seems to vary depending on the column the pixel resides in. For instance:\n    *   In `train_1`: Yellow (4) in columns 0 or 1 becomes Magenta (6), but Yellow (4) in column 2 remains Yellow (4), Yellow (4) in columns 3 or 4 becomes Gray (5), Yellow (4) in column 5 remains Yellow (4), and Yellow (4) in column 6 becomes Red (2).\n    *   In `train_2`: White (0) in columns 0, 1, or 2 becomes Green (3), but White (0) in column 3 or 5 remains White (0), White (0) in column 4 becomes Maroon (9), and White (0) in columns 6 or 7 becomes Yellow (4).\n5.  **Rule Inconsistency:** The specific color substitution rules derived from `train_1` are different from those derived from `train_2`. For example, Yellow(4) is treated differently in column 0 between the two examples (changes to Magenta(6) in train_1, stays Yellow(4) in train_2). This suggests that either these two examples represent *different* tasks, or there is a higher-level rule determining *which* column-dependent substitution map to apply, possibly based on some global property of the input grid (though this is not immediately obvious). The core observed pattern in *both* is column-dependent substitution.\n6.  **Object Integrity:** There's no clear preservation of \"objects\" (contiguous areas of the same color). The transformation slices through objects based on column lines.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

The observation that `train_1` and `train_2` yield different mappings suggests they either belong to different tasks or a meta-rule selects the mapping based on input grid properties. Assuming a single task context for now, deriving this mapping is the primary challenge.*\n3.  For each cell in the input grid, identified by its row `r` and column `c`:\n    a.
