            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Sizes**: The input grids are 3x3, and the output grids are consistently 9x9. This suggests a scaling or pattern generation process rather than a simple pixel-wise mapping.\n2.  **Color Roles**:\n    *   White (0) acts as the background color in both input and output.\n    *   Red (2) appears exactly once in each input grid, always at position (1, 1). It does *not* appear in the output. This suggests the red pixel acts as a trigger or identifier for the specific transformation rule, but its color is not directly used in the output pattern.\n    *   Green (3) appears multiple times in the input grids. It is the only non-background color present in the output grids. This suggests green is the 'active' or 'fill' color used to construct the output pattern.\n3.  **Output Structure**: The output grids consist of a white background with two distinct 4x4 square blocks filled with the green color.\n4.  **Pattern Placement**: The positions of the two green 4x4 blocks in the output seem related to the positions of the green pixels in the input. Specifically, the top-left coordinates of the green pixels in the input appear to determine the top-left coordinates of the output blocks.\n\n### YAML Facts\n\n"
