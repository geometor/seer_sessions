Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

### Perception

1.  **Input/Output Sizes**: The input grids are 3x3, and the output grids are consistently 9x9. This suggests a scaling or pattern generation process rather than a simple pixel-wise mapping.
2.  **Color Roles**:
    *   White (0) acts as the background color in both input and output.
    *   Red (2) appears exactly once in each input grid, always at position (1, 1). It does *not* appear in the output. This suggests the red pixel acts as a trigger or identifier for the specific transformation rule, but its color is not directly used in the output pattern.
    *   Green (3) appears multiple times in the input grids. It is the only non-background color present in the output grids. This suggests green is the 'active' or 'fill' color used to construct the output pattern.
3.  **Output Structure**: The output grids consist of a white background with two distinct 4x4 square blocks filled with the green color.
4.  **Pattern Placement**: The positions of the two green 4x4 blocks in the output seem related to the positions of the green pixels in the input. Specifically, the top-left coordinates of the green pixels in the input appear to determine the top-left coordinates of the output blocks.

### YAML Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  description: Transforms a 3x3 input grid into a 9x9 output grid based on the locations of specific colored pixels.
  input_grid_size: 3x3
  output_grid_size: 9x9
  background_color: 0 # white

input_elements:
  - object: trigger_pixel
    color: 2 # red
    count: 1
    role: Identifies the transformation type. Its location seems fixed at (1,1) in examples but might be variable. Its color is not propagated to the output.
  - object: pattern_pixels
    color: 3 # green
    role: Define the fill color for the output pattern and determine the placement of the output shapes based on their coordinates.

output_elements:
  - object: background
    color: 0 # white
    size: 9x9
  - object: shape_1
    type: square_block
    color: 3 # green (derived from input pattern_pixels)
    size: 4x4
    position: Determined by the minimum row and column of the input pattern_pixels.
  - object: shape_2
    type: square_block
    color: 3 # green (derived from input pattern_pixels)
    size: 4x4
    position: Determined by the minimum row and column of the input pattern_pixels, offset by +4 rows and +4 columns relative to shape_1.

transformation_rules:
  - rule: Identify the trigger pixel (red=2) and pattern pixels (green=3) in the input.
  - rule: Determine the fill color for the output from the pattern pixels (green=3).
  - rule: Find the minimum row index (min_r) and minimum column index (min_c) among all pattern pixels in the input.
  - rule: Initialize a 9x9 output grid with the background color (white=0).
  - rule: Place the first 4x4 block of the fill color in the output grid, starting at position (min_r, min_c).
  - rule: Place the second 4x4 block of the fill color in the output grid, starting at position (min_r + 4, min_c + 4).

assumptions:
  - The input grid will always contain exactly one red (2) pixel.
  - The input grid will always contain at least one green (3) pixel if a red pixel is present.
  - The transformation rule identified applies specifically when a red (2) pixel is present.
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize a 9x9 output grid filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the color of the 'pattern' pixels in the input grid; this is the non-red, non-white color present (green, 3). Let this be `fill_color`.
3.  Find all coordinates (row, column) in the input grid that contain the `fill_color`.
4.  From these coordinates, determine the minimum row index (`min_r`) and the minimum column index (`min_c`).
5.  Draw the first 4x4 square block using the `fill_color` onto the output grid, placing its top-left corner at coordinates (`min_r`, `min_c`).
6.  Calculate the position for the second block: `second_block_row = min_r + 4`, `second_block_col = min_c + 4`.
7.  Draw the second 4x4 square block using the `fill_color` onto the output grid, placing its top-left corner at coordinates (`second_block_row`, `second_block_col`).
8.  Return the modified 9x9 output grid.
