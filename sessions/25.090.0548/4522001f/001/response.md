Transforms a 3x3 input grid into a 9x9 output grid.
The transformation involves identifying a 'pattern' color (non-white, non-red) 
in the input. The minimum row and column indices of this pattern color 
determine the placement of two 4x4 blocks of the pattern color on a 
9x9 white background in the output. The second block is offset by (4, 4) 
relative to the first block's top-left corner.
