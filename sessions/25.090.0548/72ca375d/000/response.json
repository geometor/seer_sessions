In each example, there are exactly three such objects, each with a different color.\n3.  **Output Structure**: The output is a smaller grid. It appears to be a rectangular subgrid (crop) extracted from the input grid.\n4.  **Transformation**: The core task is to identify which object from the input determines the output grid, and then extract the content within that object's bounding box.\n5.  **Key Features**: The relevant features seem to be the objects themselves, their colors, their bounding boxes, and the areas of these bounding boxes.\n\n### YAML Facts\n\n"
