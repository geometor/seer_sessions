In the examples, the input is 5x5 and the output is 10x10.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of four quadrants, each the size of the input grid (H x W).\n3.  **Top-Left Quadrant:** This quadrant is an identical copy of the input grid.\n4.  **Other Quadrants:** The remaining three quadrants (Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) are filled based on derived properties of the input grid's rows and columns.\n5.  **Row/Column Property:** For each row and column in the input grid, a single \"characteristic color\" is determined. This color seems to be the most frequent non-white (non-zero) color within that row or column.\n6.  **Tie-Breaking:** If multiple non-white colors share the highest frequency in a row or column, the characteristic color is the one that appears first (at the lowest index) in that row or column.\n7.  **All-White Case:** If a row or column contains only white (zero) pixels, its characteristic color defaults to the characteristic color of the *first* row (for rows) or the *first* column (for columns).\n8.  **Top-Right Quadrant Filling:** Each column `j` in the Top-Right quadrant is filled entirely with the characteristic color `C_j` derived from the corresponding column `j` of the input grid.\n9.  **Bottom-Left Quadrant Filling:** Each row `i` in the Bottom-Left quadrant is filled entirely with the characteristic color `R_i` derived from the corresponding row `i` of the input grid.\n10. **Bottom-Right Quadrant Filling:** The color of a cell at relative coordinates `(i, j)` within the Bottom-Right quadrant depends on the characteristic row color `R_i` and the characteristic column color `C_j`. Specifically, the cell color is `R_i` if the row index `i` is greater than or equal to the column index `j` (`i >= j`), and it is `C_j` otherwise (`i < j`).\n\n**Facts YAML:**\n\n"

Copy the input grid directly into the top-left quadrant of the output grid.\n3.  Determine the characteristic color for each row of the input grid:\n    a.  For a given row, identify all non-white pixels.\n    b.  Count the occurrences of each non-white color.\n    c.  Find the color(s) that occur most frequently.\n    d.  If one color is most frequent, that is the characteristic color for the row.\n    e.  If there's a tie for the most frequent color, the characteristic color is the tied color that appears earliest (leftmost) in the row.\n    f.  If a row contains only white pixels, its characteristic color is the same as the characteristic color calculated for the first row. Store these row characteristic colors (e.g., in a list `R`).\n4.  Determine the characteristic color for each column of the input grid using the same logic as in step 3, but applied to columns: check frequencies, break ties by choosing the topmost color, and default to the first column's characteristic color if a column is all white. Store these column characteristic colors (e.g., in a list `C`).\n5.  Fill the top-right quadrant of the output grid: For each column index `j` (from 0 to width-1), fill the entire corresponding column in the top-right quadrant with the characteristic color `C[j]`.\n6.  Fill the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid: For each row index `i` (from 0 to height-1), fill the entire corresponding row in the bottom-left quadrant with the characteristic color `R[i]`.\n7.  Fill the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid: For each cell in this quadrant, let its row index within the quadrant be `i` and its column index be `j`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `j`, set the cell's color to `R[i]`. Otherwise (if `i` is less than `j`), set the cell's color to `C[j]`."
