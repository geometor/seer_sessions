**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis and code successfully identified the overall structure (2x2 quadrant expansion) and the general logic for three of the quadrants (TR, BL, BR). The failure occurred in examples `train_1` and `train_2`, both of which feature rows and columns consisting entirely of the white background color (0). The successful example `train_3` lacks these all-white lines.

The key error in the initial perception was assuming the Top-Left (TL) quadrant is an *exact* copy of the input. The comparison between the failed transformed outputs and the expected outputs reveals that rows/columns in the TL quadrant corresponding to all-white rows/columns in the input are *filled* with their respective characteristic colors (R_i or C_j), rather than being left as white.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Refine Characteristic Color Calculation:** Confirm the logic for determining row (R_i) and column (C_j) characteristic colors: most frequent non-white color, tie-break by first appearance (leftmost/topmost), default to the *first* row's/column's
