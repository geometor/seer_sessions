Create an output grid twice the height (2H) and twice the width (2W) of the input grid (HxW).\n2. Determine a 'characteristic color' for each input row (R_i) and column (C_j):\n   - Identify all non-white (non-zero) pixels in the row/column.\n   - Count the frequency of each non-white color.\n   - The characteristic color is the most frequent non-white color.\n   - Ties in frequency are broken by the color that appears earliest (leftmost for rows, topmost for columns) in the original input row/column.\n   - If a row or column contains only white pixels (all zeros), its characteristic color defaults to the characteristic color of the *first* row (for rows) or the *first* column (for columns). Store the indices of these all-white rows and columns. It is assumed the first row and first column are never all white.\n3. Populate the Top-Left (TL) quadrant (output[0:H, 0:W]):\n   - Initially, copy the input grid to the TL quadrant.\n   - For each row `i` that was all-white in the input, fill the entire row `i` of the TL quadrant with its characteristic color R_i.\n   - For each column `j` that was all-white in the input, fill the entire column `j` of the TL quadrant with its characteristic color C_j. (Column filling happens after row filling, potentially overwriting corners).\n4. Fill the Top-Right (TR) quadrant (output[0:H, W:2W]): Each column `j` (relative to the quadrant, 0 to W-1) is filled entirely with the characteristic color C_j.\n5. Fill the Bottom-Left (BL) quadrant (output[H:2H, 0:W]): Each row `i` (relative to the quadrant, 0 to H-1) is filled entirely with the characteristic color R_i.\n6. Fill the Bottom-Right (BR) quadrant (output[H:2H, W:2W]): For a cell at relative coordinates (i, j) within this quadrant (0<=i<H, 0<=j<W), set its color to R_i if i >= j, otherwise set it to C_j.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _get_characteristic_color(line):\n    \"\"\"\n    Helper function to find the characteristic color of a single row or column.\n\n    Args:\n        line: A list or 1D numpy array representing a row or column.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple: (characteristic_color, is_all_white)\n               characteristic_color (int): The determined color, or None if all white initially.\n               is_all_white (bool): True if the input line contained only 0s.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Filter out white pixels (value 0)\n    non_white_pixels = [p for p in line if p != 0]\n\n    # If no non-white pixels, mark as all white\n    if not non_white_pixels:\n        return None, True\n\n    # Count frequencies of non-white colors\n    counts = Counter(non_white_pixels)\n    \n    # Find the maximum frequency\n    max_freq = 0\n    for color in counts:\n         if counts[color] > max_freq:\n             max_freq = counts[color]\n\n    # Find all colors that have the maximum frequency\n    candidates = [color for color, freq in counts.items() if freq == max_freq]\n\n    # If only one color has the max frequency, return it\n    if len(candidates) == 1:\n        return candidates[0], False\n    else:\n        # Tie-breaking: find the first occurrence in the original line\n        first_occurrence_index = {}\n        for idx, pixel in enumerate(line):\n             if pixel in candidates and pixel not in first_occurrence_index:\n                 first_occurrence_index[pixel] = idx\n        \n        # Find the candidate color with the minimum first occurrence index\n        best_candidate = -1 # Placeholder\n        min_idx = float('inf')\n        # Ensure all candidates are found in the line before proceeding\n        # (this should always be true if candidates came from 'line')\n        found_candidates = {pixel: index for pixel, index in first_occurrence_index.items() if pixel in candidates}\n        \n        for color in candidates:\n             # Use the pre-calculated index; handle cases where a candidate might not be found (shouldn't happen here)\n            idx = found_candidates.get(color, float('inf')) \n            if idx < min_idx:\n                 min_idx = idx\n                 best_candidate = color\n        return best_candidate, False\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation logic to the input grid.\n    \n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier slicing and manipulation\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    H, W = input_np.shape # Get height and width\n\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros, twice the dimensions\n    output_grid = np.zeros((2 * H, 2 * W), dtype=int)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate Characteristic Colors and track all-white lines ---\n    R = [0] * H # Characteristic colors for rows\n    C = [0] * W # Characteristic colors for columns\n    all_white_rows = []\n    all_white_cols = []\n\n    # Calculate for Row 0 (assumed not all white)\n    R[0], is_white = _get_characteristic_color(input_np[0, :])\n    if is_white:\n        # This case should not happen based on observed patterns/implicit constraints\n        # If it did, the logic breaks down.
