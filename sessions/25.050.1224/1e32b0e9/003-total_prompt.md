Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: L-shape and single blocks
      positions: Several, forming a cross-like pattern
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Vertical and horizontal lines, and a large horizontal block
      positions: Forming a grid-like pattern, with a solid block at rows 6 and 12.
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: Background
      positions: Filling the remaining cells

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: L-shape and single blocks
      positions: Similar to the input, but with slight shifts
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Modified vertical and horizontal lines. Most of the lines exist, plus some additional instances.
      positions: Filling cells adjacent to color 2.
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: Background
      positions: Filling the remaining cells
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of color 2 (red) and color 8 (azure) in the input grid.

2.  **Preserve Base:** Maintain all existing elements in the output.

3.  **The Azure Filling Rule:**
    *   For each cell containing color 8 in the input, maintain that cell.
    *   For each cell containing a 2 in the input, add an 8 in any adjacent cell (horizontally and vertically, not diagonally) that contain a zero.

**Explanation of the Transformation**

The core transformation is to take the azure (8) and to fill the adjacent empty cells around all instances of the red (2). The overall effect appears to be a kind of "filling" or "expansion" of the azure color (8) surrounding the red color (2). The original azure lines are preserved. The red instances are preserved.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1.  Preserve all instances of color 2 (red) and 8 (azure).
2.  For each cell containing color 2, change any adjacent (up, down, left, right) 
    cells with color 0 (white) to color 8 (azure).
