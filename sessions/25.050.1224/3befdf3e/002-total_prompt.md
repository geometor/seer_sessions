Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 4 # Yellow
      shape: rectangle
      position: (3,3) # Top-left corner of the rectangle
      size: (3,3) # 3x3 rectangle
      properties:
        - Contains a single magenta (6) cell in the center.
    - color: 6 # Magenta
      shape: single cell
      position: (4,4)
      size: (1,1)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 4 # Yellow
      shape: rectangle
      position: (2,2) # Top-left corner
      size: (5,5)
      properties:
        - Contains a 3x3 magenta square in the center
    - color: 6
      shape: rectangle
      position: (3,3)
      size: (3,3)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify the core object:** In the input grid, there is a 3x3 yellow (color 4) rectangle with a magenta (color 6) cell at its center.

2.  **Describe Object Expansion and Predicates:**
    -   The yellow rectangle *expands* by one cell in all directions (up, down, left, and right.)
    -   The central magenta cell *expands* to become a 3x3 rectangle.
    -   The expansion occurs vertically and horizontally.

3.  **Describe Action:**
   -   The existing yellow shape grows by one layer, keeping its square form.
   -    The central magenta dot grows by one cell up and down, and to the sides, to make a 3x3 square.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule is an expansion of both the outer yellow rectangle and the inner magenta cell. The yellow rectangle expands outwards by one cell in all directions, and the magenta cell expands to a 3x3 rectangle.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
