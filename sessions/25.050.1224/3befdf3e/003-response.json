            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the second example.\n\n**YAML Description of Observations**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  objects:\n    - color: 2 # Red\n      shape: rectangle\n      position: (3,3)\n      size: (4,4)\n      properties:\n        - Contains a 2x2 orange (7) square in the center.\n    - color: 7 # Orange\n      shape: rectangle\n      position: (4,4)\n      size: (2,2)\n\noutput_grid:\n  objects:\n    - color: 2 # Red\n      shape:  \"cross-like\" or plus sign + surrounding cells\n      position: (1,3) #relative\n      size: (7,4) #approximate, the filled area\n      properties:\n        - Contains a larger, more complex orange shape, formed around the initial orange object\n    - color: 7 # Orange\n      shape: \"cross-like\" or plus sign\n      position: (3,3)\n      size: (3,4)\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify the core objects:**\n    *   A 4x4 red (color 2) rectangle.\n    *   A 2x2 orange (color 7) square inside the red rectangle.\n\n2.  **Describe Object Interactions, Predicates, and Actions:**\n    *   The 2x2 orange square expands. It expands to a cross-like shape, composed of orange at the center and four \"arms\" extending north, south, east and west. The vertical \"arm\" is of length three.\n    *   The red shape expands vertically and horizontally. The top and bottom rows of the red shape are copied up/down by one row. And an additional two cells on each side appear to make the final shape.\n\n3.  **Transformation as Action:**\n    -   The orange 2x2 shape transforms into a cross, keeping its center, and expanding up, down and sideways.\n    -    The red cells 'move' to accommodate and surround the new shape of the orange object.\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation involves two main actions: The inner orange square expands into a cross-like shape, and the outer red rectangle expands and reshapes to fit and to surround the expanded orange object.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation involves two main actions: The inner orange square expands into a cross-like shape, and the outer red rectangle expands and reshapes to fit and to surround the expanded orange object.\n\"\"\"\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Find the orange object\n    orange_coords = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 7:\n                orange_coords.append((r, c))\n\n    # Expand the orange object into cross shape\n    if orange_coords:\n      min_or = min(r for r,c in orange_coords)\n      max_or = max(r for r,c in orange_coords)\n      min_oc = min(c for r,c in orange_coords)\n      max_oc = max(c for r,c in orange_coords)\n\n      center_r = (min_or + max_or) //2\n      center_c = (min_oc + max_oc) //2\n\n      #central square\n      for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n          if input_grid[r,c] == 7:\n            output_grid[r,c] = 7\n      #vertical arm\n      output_grid[center_r -1, center_c] = 7\n      output_grid[center_r -1, center_c + 1] = 7\n\n    # find red object\n    red_coords = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r,c] == 2:\n              red_coords.append((r,c))\n    if red_coords:\n      min_rr = min(r for r, c in red_coords)\n      max_rr = max(r for r, c in red_coords)\n      min_rc = min(c for r, c in red_coords)\n      max_rc = max(c for r, c in red_coords)\n      # copy first and last rows\n      for c in range(min_rc, max_rc+1):\n        if min_rr > 0:\n            output_grid[min_rr-1, c] = 2\n        if max_rr < rows -1:\n            output_grid[max_rr+1,c] = 2\n      # add columns\n      for r in range(min_rr-1, max_rr + 2):\n\n          if min_oc > 0:\n              output_grid[r,min_oc-1] = 2\n          if max_oc < cols-1:\n              output_grid[r,max_oc+2] = 2\n\n          if 0 <= r < rows:\n              if min_rc>0:\n                  output_grid[r,min_rc-1] = 2\n              if max_rc < cols -1:\n                  output_grid[r,max_rc+1] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
