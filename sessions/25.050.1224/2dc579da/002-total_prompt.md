**input**
```
8 8 3 8 8
8 8 3 8 8
3 3 3 3 3
8 8 3 8 8
4 8 3 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x79CABB63B520>

**output**
```
8 8
4 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x79CABB63B6A0>
Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: [5, 5]
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: "Mostly scattered, forms a frame around color 3"
      count: 16
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: "Forms a cross or plus shape"
      count: 5
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: "Single square"
      count: 1
output_grid:
  size: [2, 2]
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: "Fills three cells of the 2x2 grid"
      count: 3
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: "Single square"
      count: 1
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Key Colors:** The colors present in both input and output are 8 (azure) and 4 (yellow). Color 3 (green) is gone.

2. **Discard the 'cross':** The central cross made by color 3 is discarded.

3.  **Focus on the corners:** Consider the corners of the original 5x5 grid. And extract a 2x2 subgrid with the colors present in the bottom corners.

4. **Result:** A 2x2 output grid including the bottom two rows and left two columns.

**In summary:**

The transformation rule is: Extract the 2x2 bottom-left corner of the original grid and discard the colors that disappear.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
