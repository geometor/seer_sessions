Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 10x10
  objects:
    - color: 9
      shape: single cell
      position: (0, 4)
    - color: 8
      shape: 2x3 rectangle
      position: (3, 4)
    - color: 6
      shape: single cell
      position: (6, 0)
    - color: 4
      shape: single cell
      position: (9, 5)

output_grid:
  size: 10x10
  objects:
    - color: 9
      shape: single cell, and a 1x2 vertical rectangle
      position: original (0, 4), adjacent (3,4)
    - color: 8
      shape: 2x2 square, and single cell
      position: original (4,4), adjacent (3,5)
    - color: 6
      shape: single cell, and single cell
      position: original (6, 0), adjacent (6,4)
    - color: 4
      shape: single cell, and single cell
      position: original (9, 5), adjacent (6,5)
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct objects in the input grid. We have four single-color cells (9, 6, and 4, one each) and the rectangle made with color 8.

2.  **Move 9**: The cell with color 9 combines with the 8 object. Specifically, color 9 moves to the top of the closest 8 object. This creates an object with 9 on top and 8 at the bottom.

3.  **Move 6:** The cell with color 6 moves to the bottom left side of the closest color 8, but at the level of the bottom row of the 8 rectangle.

4. **Move 8:** We use the top left corner of the 8 to find a cell to separate from the rectangle, at (3,5).

5.  **Move 4:** The cell with color 4 moves near the object made of color 8, maintaining the column, but getting as close as possible to the object.

**Summary**
Each single color cell targets the 8 object. Each one takes a different position. Number 9 takes the upper one, number 4 takes the center one and number 6 takes the left-bottom one. The 8 object loses one cell.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
