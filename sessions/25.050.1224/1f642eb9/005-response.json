Notice how similar the setup is from previous prompt.\n\n2.  **Move 8:**\n    - The cell at the position (3,5) on the object with color 8 is removed.\n\n3.  **Move Single Cells to the 8 object**:\n    - The object made with color 3 is now on the left side of the 8 object, in its same row.\n    - The object made with color 6 is now on the right side of the 8 object, in its same row.\n    - The object made with color 4 is now at the top of the 8 object.\n    - The object made with color 7 is now on the left side of the 8 object, in its same row.\n\n4. **Move 8**:\n    - The cell at position (3,5) is now next to the 2 cell, on its right side.\n   \n\n5.  **Summary**: The 8 object loses one cell. The single cells target the 8 object. Numbers 3 and 6 combine on the sides, while numbers 4 and 7 occupy the upper and lower sides, respectively. Color 2 get the extra cell of 8.\n\nThis description captures the essence of the transformation using the concepts of objects, predicates (positions, shapes), and actions (moves, additions).\n"
