Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input to the output grid in this fourth example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 10x10
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Irregular (horizontal line and a single cell below)
      position: Centered vertically, slightly offset to the right
      bounding_box: [4,3] to [6,5]
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: Single cell
      position: Below the azure object
      bounding_box: [6,5] to [6,5]

output_grid:
  size: 10x10
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: Filled rectangle
      position: covers the entire grid
      bounding_box: [0,0] to [9,9]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: "C" shape.
      position: Center
      bounding_box: [4,3] to [7,5]

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Azure Object:** Locate the contiguous region of azure (color 8) cells in the input grid.
2.  **Identify the Red Object**: Notice that some parts of the red objects (color 2) cells in the original input grid are replaced by color 8.

3.  **Combine Colors**: Replace every cell with color code `2` and replace it with color code `8`.

4.  **Extend Object:** Extend the existing object (color 8) down one row from the new addition.

5.  **Background Change:** Change all the cells in the input grid to color 3 (green) except for the object with color 8.

**Complete Description:**

The transformation involves several actions. The cell with color code `2` is replaced with color code `8`. Then this new cell will have a copy below. After that, the background, originally white (color 0), is changed to green (color 3), while the azure object remains unchanged.

    output_grid[input_grid == 2] = 8

    #Extend the existing object.
    if len(red_coords) > 0:
      row, col = red_coords[0]
      output_grid[row+1, col] = 8


    # Create a new grid filled with color 3 (green).
    new_output_grid = np.full(input_grid.shape, 3)

    # Copy the azure (color 8) object from output_grid to new_output_grid.
    new_output_grid[output_grid == 8] = 8

    return new_output_grid
```
