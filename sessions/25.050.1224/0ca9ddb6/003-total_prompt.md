Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3,2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1
      position: (6,6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 0
      position: all other cells
      shape: background

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3,2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1
      position: (6,6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 4
      positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)]
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 7
      positions: [(5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 0
      position: all other cells
      shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Cells:** Locate the single red (color 2) cell and the single blue (color 1) cell in the input grid. These cells remain unchanged in position and color in the output grid.

2.  **Yellow Expansion:** A yellow (color 4) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the row above and the row below the red cell.

3. **Orange expansion:** An orange (color 7) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the column to the left and the column to the right of the blue cell.

**Step-by-step Transformation Description:**

1.  The red (2) cell at (3, 2) and the blue (1) cell at (6, 6) in the input are copied to the same positions in the output.
2.  Yellow (4) cells are placed on the cells located at one row of distance from the red cell.
3.  Orange (7) cells are placed on the cells located at one column of distance of the blue cell.

In summary, this task shows object constancy, with a shape created around two selected objects based on colors.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1.  The single red (color 2) cell and the single blue (color 1) cell in the input remain unchanged.
2.  A yellow (color 4) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the row above and the row below the red cell.
3.  An orange (color 7) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the column to the left and the column to the right of the blue cell.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
