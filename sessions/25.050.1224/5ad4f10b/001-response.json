It does not matter whether the adjacent is side-by-side or diagonal.\n\n3. **Create a 3x3 grid:** A smaller new grid is formed using only the selected azure cells.\n\n4. **Place Azure and White cells:** All azure blue are selected to form a 3x3 grid. If it is a white adjecency, the output is white, if it is color 4, the output is azure.\n\n**Explanation and Justification**\n\nThe transformation focuses solely on the azure (8) colored cells. The large yellow (4) block and the white (0) background are essentially ignored for the coordinates, but are used to build the output.\n\nThe program captures this core logic concisely. The key is recognizing that only the *azure* cells from the input are used to form the output.\n"
