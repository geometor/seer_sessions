Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [20, 24]
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: Scattered throughout, many isolated instances.
      shape: Mostly single cells, some pairs.
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: Large rectangular block in the center.
      position: Bounded by azure (8) cells.
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: Background.
      position: Fills the remaining space.

output_grid:
  dimensions: [3, 3]
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2)]
      shape: single cells
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Cells:** Locate all cells in the input grid with the color 8 (azure).

2.  **Count Isolated and Paired Azure:** We need to find the azure(8) pixels that have color 0 or color 4 in their adjacencies. It does not matter whether the adjacent is side-by-side or diagonal.

3. **Create a 3x3 grid:** A smaller new grid is formed using only the selected azure cells.

4. **Place Azure and White cells:** All azure blue are selected to form a 3x3 grid. If it is a white adjecency, the output is white, if it is color 4, the output is azure.

**Explanation and Justification**

The transformation focuses solely on the azure (8) colored cells. The large yellow (4) block and the white (0) background are essentially ignored for the coordinates, but are used to build the output.

The program captures this core logic concisely. The key is recognizing that only the *azure* cells from the input are used to form the output.

```python
"""
The transformation extracts all azure (8) colored cells from the input grid.
Then determines if the adjecent cells are 0 or 4.
Forms an output using only the selected azure cells.
If adjacent to 0, the output is 0. If adjacent to 4, the output is 8.
