Some isolated instances replaced white\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify Borders:** Locate the frame/border formed by color 2 (red) along the top rows and the rightmost column, and the frame/border formed by color 8 (azure) along the bottom rows and the leftmost column.\n\n2.  **Interior Filling:** Within the area enclosed by these borders, identify a vertical line of White (0) pixels extending downwards from the red frame. Change these pixels to green.\n\n3. **Interior Filling:** Within the area enclosed by these borders and adjacent to the pixels turned Green in step 2, change all white (0) pixels within the frames to green (3).\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation preserves the red (2) and azure (8) borders. The core rule is to change the white pixels vertically aligned with the red frame to green, then fill the rest of the interior region bounded by the red and azure frames with green (3).\n"
