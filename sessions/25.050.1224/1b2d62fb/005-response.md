Okay, let's analyze this third example and refine our understanding of the transformation rule.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 5x7
  objects:
    blue_line:
      color: 1
      shape: vertical line
      position: center column
    maroon_pixels:
      color: 9
      shape: scattered
      position: surrounding the blue line
    white_pixels:
      color: 0
      shape: scattered
      position: surrounding the blue line

output_grid:
  size: 5x3
  objects:
    azure_pixels:
      color: 8
      shape: scattered, no clear pattern at first glance
      position: dispersed across multiple rows
    white_pixels:
      color: 0
      shape: background
      position: filling the remaining cells
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** In the input grid, locate all pixels with the color blue (value 1). It's not necessarily a contiguous line this time.

2.  **Resize the Grid:** The output grid has dimensions of 5 rows and 3 columns.

3.  **Map Blue to Azure:** For *each* row in the input grid where a blue pixel exists, place an azure pixel (value 8) in the output grid. The output grid's azure pixel placement corresponds to the input's blue pixel presence on a row-by-row basis within the resized width.  If a blue pixel exists anywhere in columns 0,1 or 2 of a given row, put azure in position (row,0). If it exists in column 3, put an azure in position (row,1). If it exist on columns 4,5 or 6 put azure in (row, 2).

4.  **Fill Remaining with White:** All other cells in the output grid that don't correspond to a row with a blue pixel are set to white (value 0).

**Explanation and Refinement of the Rule:**

This example clarifies a crucial point: The rule isn't strictly about a *vertical line* of blue, but rather the *presence* of blue within each row. If any blue pixel appears in a row in the input grid, then an azure is generated to output. The column where azure appears depends on the input column.

```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid based on the presence of blue pixels in each row.
    """
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, 3), dtype=int)

    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if input_grid[i, j] == 1:
                if j in [0, 1, 2]:
                    output_grid[i,0] = 8
                if j == 3:
                    output_grid[i,1] = 8
                if j in [4,5,6]:
                    output_grid[i,2] = 8

    return output_grid
```

Key improvements in this final version:

*   **Handles Scattered Blue:**  The code now correctly processes cases where blue pixels are not forming a straight vertical line. It checks each cell individually.
*   **Row-Based Mapping:** The logic explicitly maps the presence of blue in a *row* of the input to the presence of azure in the *same row* of the output.
*   **Column Mapping**: The columns are now also mapped accordingly.

This revised explanation and code provide a more general and accurate solution for the transformation task.
