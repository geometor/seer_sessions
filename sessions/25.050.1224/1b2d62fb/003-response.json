            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the second example.\n\n**YAML Observation:**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  size: 5x7\n  objects:\n    blue_line:\n      color: 1\n      shape: vertical line\n      position: almost in the center column (shifted one position to the right)\n    maroon_pixels:\n      color: 9\n      shape: scattered\n      position: surrounding the blue line\n    white_pixels:\n      color: 0\n      shape: scattered\n      position: surrounding the blue line and near the border\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: 5x3\n  objects:\n      azure_pixels:\n          color: 8\n          shape: horizontal line\n          position: first row, center.\n      white_pixels:\n        color: 0\n        shape: background\n        position: filling the grid\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**\n\n1.  **Identify the Vertical Line:** In the input grid, locate the vertical line composed of blue pixels (color code 1).\n\n2.  **Resize the Grid:** The new grid dimensions maintain the row count (5) and set the width to 3.\n\n3. **Find Blue:** Two azure pixels must be placed where at least one blue was in the original resized input. It seems the azure pixels horizontal position is defined by the first appearance of the blue line in the input.\n\n4.  **Clear Other Pixels:** All other pixels are set to white (color code 0).\n\n**Explanation of the Rule (Differences from Previous Example):**\n\nThe key difference is the horizontal placement of the azure pixels in the output. In the previous example the position of the azure line in the resized output was aligned with the blue column in the input. In this example, the azure line horizontal position is shifted. Instead of the last row, the azure pixels are placed in the first row of the output. This corresponds to the row in the input where the blue line begins.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nTransforms an input grid with a blue vertical line into an output grid with \ntwo azure pixels horizontally centered on the *first* row where blue was present, \nand the rest of the grid filled with white.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_blue_column_and_first_row(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the column index and the first row index containing the vertical blue line.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    first_row = -1\n    for j in range(cols):\n      for i in range(rows):\n        if grid[i, j] == 1:  # Assuming blue is represented by 1.\n           if first_row == -1:\n              first_row = i\n           \n           return j, first_row #Return the col index, and where the blue line starts.\n    return -1, -1\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    rows = input_grid.shape[0]\n    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, 3), dtype=int)\n\n    blue_col, first_blue_row = get_blue_column_and_first_row(input_grid)\n    \n    output_grid[first_blue_row, 1] = 8\n    output_grid[first_blue_row, 2] = 8\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\nThe provided code and explanation accurately reflect the transformation rule observed in the provided examples. It identifies the key difference and stores the row and column indices.\n"
