            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this example.\n\n**YAML Observation:**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  size: 5x7\n  objects:\n    blue_line:\n      color: 1\n      shape: vertical line\n      position: center column\n    maroon_pixels:\n      color: 9\n      shape: scattered\n      position: surrounding the blue line\n    white_pixels:\n      color: 0\n      shape: scattered\n      position: surrounding the blue line\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: 5x3\n  objects:\n    azure_pixels:\n      color: 8\n      shape: scattered\n      position: dispersed, corresponding to blue pixel rows in input\n    white_pixels:\n      color: 0\n      shape: background\n      position: filling the remaining cells\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**\n\n1.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** Locate all pixels colored blue (value 1) in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Resize the Grid:** The output grid maintains the same number of rows (5) as the input grid but reduces the width to 3 columns.\n\n3.  **Map Blue to Azure based on columns:**\n    *   If a blue pixel exists anywhere in columns 0, 1, or 2 of a given row in input, place an azure pixel (8) in position (row, 0) of the output.\n    *   If there exists a blue pixel in column 3 of the input, place an azure pixel in (row, 1) of the output.\n    *   If there exists a blue pixel in columns 4, 5, or 6 of a given row of the input, an azure pixel is placed in (row, 2) of the output grid.\n\n4.  **Fill Remaining with White:** All cells in the output grid that do not have an azure pixel placed in them are set to white (value 0).\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe transformation maps rows containing blue pixels in input to azure pixels in output using a resized width. The position of azure in the output is now dependent of the column of the input.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the presence of blue pixels in each row.\n    The output grid has a width of 3 and the same number of rows as the input.\n    If a blue pixel exists anywhere in columns 0, 1, or 2 of a given row,\n    an azure pixel (8) is placed in position (row, 0) of the output grid.\n    If a blue pixel exists in column 3 of a given row, an azure pixel is\n    placed in position (row, 1) of the output grid.\n    If a blue pixel exists in columns 4, 5, or 6 of a given row, an azure\n    pixel is placed in (row, 2) of the output grid.  All other cells are 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, 3), dtype=int)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[i, j] == 1:\n                if j in [0, 1, 2]:\n                    output_grid[i,0] = 8\n                if j == 3:\n                    output_grid[i,1] = 8\n                if j in [4,5,6]:\n                    output_grid[i,2] = 8\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\nThe Python code and natural language program are consistent with previous implementations and observations. I did not change the code as the last implementation correctly addresses this case.\n"
