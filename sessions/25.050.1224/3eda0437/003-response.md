Okay, let's analyze the second transformation.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  - dimensions: [4, 20]
  - objects:
    - color: 1 (blue)
      properties:
        - description: Scattered and contiguous regions of varying sizes.
    - color: 0 (white)
      properties:
        - description: Background, interspersed with blue regions.
    - color: 1
      shape: rectangle
      size: [1,3]
      position: [0,14]

output_grid:
  - dimensions: [4, 20]
  - objects:
    - color: 1 (blue)
      properties:
        - description: Similar to input, except for a region replaced by color 6.
    - color: 0 (white)
      properties:
        - description: Background, unchanged from input.
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      properties:
        - description: A 1x3 rectangular block in rows 1 and 2.
      shape: rectangle
      size: [1,3]
      position: [0,14]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Target Object:** Locate the contiguous 1x3 rectangle of blue (color 1) cells starting at the coordinates (0,14) which is row 0, column 14 of the input grid.
2.  **Change Object Color:** Transform or replace the identified rectangular block of blue cells with a magenta block (color 6).
3.  **Preserve Other Elements:** All other cells in the grid remain unchanged.

In short: The transformation isolates a specified rectangular block of blue cells (1x3) and turns it magenta, while everything else stays the same. The only difference with the previous example is the target object's dimensions and position.

```python
"""
Locates a 1x3 contiguous block of blue (color 1) cells starting at row 0, column 14 in the input grid,
and replaces it with magenta (color 6) cells. All other cells remain unchanged.

def find_object(grid, color, size, start_row, start_col):

    Args:
