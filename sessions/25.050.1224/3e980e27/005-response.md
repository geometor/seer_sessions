Okay, let's analyze the third example provided.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 13x13
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      positions: [(1, 10), (7, 7)]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 3 (green)
      positions: [(2, 2), (8, 1)]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2)]
      shape: L-shape
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      positions:  [(7, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8)]
      shape: L-shape

output_grid:
  size: 13x13
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      positions: [(1, 10), (7, 7)]
      shape: single cell
     - color: 3 (green)
      positions: [(2, 2), (8, 1)]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (8,2), (9,1), (9,2)]
      shape: Two distinct L shapes, one original, one mirrored on X axis.
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      positions:  [(1,11), (2, 10), (2, 11), (7, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8)]
      shape: L-shape and Mirrored shape
```

**Natural Language Program: Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, there are four types of objects:
    *   Red (color 2) single-cell objects.
    *   Green (color 3) single-cell objects.
    *   Azure (color 8) L-shaped object.
    *  Yellow (color 4) L-Shaped object.

2.  **Preservation of Single-Cell Objects:**  The red and green single-cell objects remain in their original positions and colors in the output grid.

3.  **Mirror some objects** Azure and Yellow objects are mirrored according to the position of some red objects:
 * Azure Object (color 8) are mirrored based on the green objects.
 * Yellow Object (color 4) are mirrored based on the red objects.

4.  **Transformation Details:**
    *   The original azure and yellow objects are preserved.
    *   The mirrored object appears in the output grid.

**Complete Description**

The azure and yellow objects are mirrored based on the position of the green and red, respectively. The single-cell red and green objects do not change.

```python
