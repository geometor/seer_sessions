The colors are gray (5), azure (8), and magenta (6), from left to right.\n\n2.  **Color Mapping:** Each color in the input grid is transformed to a new color, maintaining the column structure.\n\n3.  **Transformation rule**:\n    -   Gray (5) is transformed to Blue (1).\n    -   Azure (8) is transformed to Maroon (9).\n    -   Magenta (6) is transformed to Red (2).\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nBased on all three examples, we can determine the following:\nThe transformation rule is a color mapping, where the input colors change to new colors as following\n\n```\n1 -> 5\n2 -> 6\n3 -> 4\n5 -> 1\n6 -> 2\n8 -> 9\n```\nThe python code needs to be updated:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe input grid consists of three columns, each of a single color.\nThe transformation rule is a color mapping.\n\nBased on the provided examples:\n1 -> 5\n2 -> 6\n3 -> 4\n5 -> 1\n6 -> 2\n8 -> 9\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on a color mapping rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each cell of the output grid.\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Apply the color mapping based on the input value.\n            if input_grid[i, j] == 1:\n                output_grid[i, j] = 5\n            elif input_grid[i, j] == 2:\n                output_grid[i, j] = 6\n            elif input_grid[i, j] == 3:\n                output_grid[i, j] = 4\n            elif input_grid[i, j] == 5:\n                output_grid[i, j] = 1\n            elif input_grid[i, j] == 6:\n                output_grid[i, j] = 2\n            elif input_grid[i, j] == 8:\n                output_grid[i, j] = 9\n            else:\n                output_grid[i,j] = input_grid[i,j]\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
