Okay, let's analyze the third example and confirm the established rule.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: Irregular, two separate blocks.
      position: Distributed across the grid.
      size: Spans multiple rows and columns.
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: Background
      position: Fills the entire grid.
      size: 10x10

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: Same as in the input grid.
      position: Same as in the input grid.
      size: Same as in the input grid
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: Irregular
      position: left of the blue object.
      size: Covers multiple pixels.
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: Background
      position: Fills the entire grid.
      size: 10x10

```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the contiguous blue (1) object within the input grid. It maintains its shape, size and position.

2.  **Detect Change:** We can see changes only happening on the rows that contains blue pixels. The left most blue pixels in these rows are changed to red.

3. **Preserve and Create**: Preserve the blue shape. Locate all the rows with blue pixels in the input. Change the left most blue pixels to red. If a row contains less than 3 blue pixels, change all the blue pixels in this row to red.

**Step-by-step Summary**

1. Copy the blue object from the input.
2. Find the all the rows which contain blue pixels. For each of these rows, change up to 3 leftmost blue pixels to red, unless the total number of blue pixels in a given row is fewer than 3, in which case change all to red.

The natural language description and Python code from the previous round accurately capture the transformation rule, and this third example confirms it. No changes are needed to either the natural language description or code.
