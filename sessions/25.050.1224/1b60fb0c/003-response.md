Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: Irregular, two symmetrical blocks.
      position: Centered vertically.
      size: Spans multiple rows and columns.
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: Background
      position: Fills the entire grid.
      size: 10x10

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: Same as in the input grid.
      position: Same as in the input grid.
      size: Same as in the input grid
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: Irregular
      position: left of the blue object
      size: covers multiple pixels.
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: Background
      position: Fills the entire grid.
      size: 10x10

```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the contiguous blue (1) object within the input grid.  It maintains its shape, size and position.

2.  **Detect Change:** The changes happen across multiple rows that contains the most blue pixels. The leftmost blue pixels are changed to red. The number of red pixels may vary.

3. **Preserve and Create**: Preserve the blue shape. Locate the rows with blue pixels in the input. Change the left most blue pixels to red with a maximum length of 3.

**Step-by-step Summary**
1. Copy the blue object from the input.
2. Find the rows in the input which contain the blue object. Change up to 3 leftmost blue pixels in each of these rows to red. If a row has less than or equal to three blue pixels and at least one blue pixel, all of those get changed to color red.

```python
