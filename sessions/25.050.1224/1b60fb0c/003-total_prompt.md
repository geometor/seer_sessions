Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: Irregular, resembling a stylized "S" or a winding path.
      position: Centered vertically, slightly off-center horizontally.
      size: Spans multiple rows and columns.
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: Background
      position: Fills the entire grid.
      size: 10x10

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: Same as in the input grid.
      position: Same as in the input grid.
      size: Same as in the input grid
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: L-shaped, 2x2
      position: left of the blue object
      size: 3 contiguous pixels.
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: Background
      position: Fills the entire grid.
      size: 10x10

```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the contiguous blue (1) object within the input grid.  It maintains its shape, size and position.

2.  **Detect Change:** We can see the changes only happen on the blue object, row 5 from top. The left most 3 blue pixels are changed to color red.

3. **Preserve and Create**: Preserve the blue shape. Locate the row that contains most blue pixels in the input. Change the left most 3 blue pixels in that row to red.

**Step-by-step Summary**
1. Copy the blue object from the input.
2. Find the left most 3 blue pixels on row 5 and change them to red.

```python

import numpy as np

def find_object(grid, color):
    # Find coordinates of all cells with the specified color.
    coords = np.argwhere(grid == color)
    return coords

def transform(input_grid):
    """

    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Copy the blue object (color 1)
    # No operation needed as the initial copy already includes blue pixels.
    
    # Find the 5th row (index 4).
    row_index = 4
    
    #Find the leftmost 3 blue pixels
    blue_pixels_in_row = np.where(output_grid[row_index,:]==1)[0]
    
    if len(blue_pixels_in_row) >=3:
        for i in range(3):
            output_grid[row_index,blue_pixels_in_row[i]] = 2
    

    return output_grid
```

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
