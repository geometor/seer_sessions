Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x9
  objects:
    color_1:
      - position: [0, 2]
      - position: [0, 3]
      - position: [2, 0]
      - position: [2, 6]
      - position: [2, 7]
    color_4:
      - position: [0, 0]
      - position: [0, 5]
      - position: [0, 6]
      - position: [2, 2]
      - position: [2, 3]
      - position: [2, 8]
    color_5:
      - position: [0, 1]
      - position: [0, 4]
      - position: [0, 7]
      - position: [1, 0]
      - position: [1, 1]
      - position: [1, 2]
      - position: [1, 3]
      - position: [1, 4]
      - position: [1, 5]
      - position: [1, 6]
      - position: [1, 7]
      - position: [1, 8]
      - position: [2, 1]
      - position: [2, 5]
output_grid:
    size: 3x3
    objects:
        color_1:
          - position: [0, 2]
          - position: [2, 0]
        color_4:
          - position: [0, 0]
          - position: [2, 2]
        color_5:
          - position: [0, 1]
          - position: [1, 0]
          - position: [1, 1]
          - position: [1, 2]
          - position: [2, 1]
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Identify Columns:** Examine the input grid, which is 3x9.
2.  **Select Columns:** Take every third column of the input grid starting from the first column. That is, consider column 0, column 3, and column 6.
3. Remove other columns.
4.  **Construct Output:** Arrange the content of these selected columns to construct the output grid of size 3x3, preserving the original order of rows.

In other words, the output grid is formed by sampling specific columns from the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
