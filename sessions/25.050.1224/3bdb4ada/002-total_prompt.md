Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
objects:
  yellow_rectangle_top:
    color: 4
    shape: rectangle
    position: top
    size: large
  azure_rectangle_bottom:
    color: 8
    shape: rectangle
    position: bottom
    size: large
    
changes:
  yellow_rectangle_top:
      pattern: checkerboard, alternating yellow and background (0)
  azure_rectangle_bottom:
      pattern: checkerboard, alternating azure and background (0), starting one position right.

```

**Natural Language Program Description**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two primary objects:
    *   A large rectangular block of yellow (4) cells at the top.
    *   A large rectangular block of azure (8) cells at the bottom.

2.  **Transformation Rule (Checkerboard Pattern):**
     - The yellow (4) color object transforms into a checkerboard-like, or a chessboard-like, pattern. The pattern
       preserves a yellow border, and alternates between empty(0) in the input and yellow(4), starting with yellow(4) in the
       output grid, along each row, and along each column.
    - The azure(8) color object transforms into a similar patter. The pattern
       preserves an azure border, and alternates between empty(0) in the input and azure (8), starting with azure (8) in the
       output grid, along each row, and with empty(0) along each column.

    *   Essentially, every other cell within each rectangle, starting with the first and third cells, changes to 0, creating
        the checkerboard pattern.

**Conclusion**

The transformation involves changing solid colored rectangles into checkered patterns of the respective object's color (yellow and azure). Every odd row maintains its alternating color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
