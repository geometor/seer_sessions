The pattern\n       preserves a yellow border, and alternates between empty(0) in the input and yellow(4), starting with yellow(4) in the\n       output grid, along each row, and along each column.\n    - The azure(8) color object transforms into a similar patter. The pattern\n       preserves an azure border, and alternates between empty(0) in the input and azure (8), starting with azure (8) in the\n       output grid, along each row, and with empty(0) along each column.\n\n    *   Essentially, every other cell within each rectangle, starting with the first and third cells, changes to 0, creating\n        the checkerboard pattern.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe transformation involves changing solid colored rectangles into checkered patterns of the respective object's color (yellow and azure). Every odd row maintains its alternating color.\n"
