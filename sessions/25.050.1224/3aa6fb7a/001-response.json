Same as the input.\n    - color: 1 (blue)\n      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]\n      shape: 1x1 blocks\n  background_color: 0 (white)\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we find two azure (color 8) objects. One is a vertical 2x1 block on the left, the other an horizontal 1x2 block on the right.\n\n2.  **Detect Change:** Comparing to the output grid we see that azure objects are mantained, and we also observe that that a blue pixel (color 1) appears in output just on the right of isolated azure pixel.\n\n3. **Transformation rule:**\n    Change to blue the pixel at the right of each isolated azure pixel.\n    An isolated azure pixel is any azure pixel having only azure neighbours on its left.\n\n**Elaboration of Reasoning**\n\nThe core of the transformation lies in identifying the isolated azure pixels and change to blue the pixels in the positions to their right.\n"
