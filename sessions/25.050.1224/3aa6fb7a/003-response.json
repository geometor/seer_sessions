If an azure pixel has only azure neighbors to its left, change the pixel immediately to the right of it to blue (color 1).\n  If the azure pixel is at the extreme right, do nothing.\n\n3. **Elaboration:**\n    We iterate to apply the rule to each of isolated azure pixels.\n\n**Python Implementation**\n\nThe provided Python code from the previous response already implements this logic correctly.  The `transform` function and `get_neighbors` correctly identify the \"isolated azure pixels\" and adds a blue pixel to their right. We can reuse the same function.\n"
