            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.\n\n**YAML Description of Observations**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  size: 9x9\n  objects:\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      positions: [(1,1), (1,5), (1,8), (3,3), (3,7), (5,1), (5,5), (7,3), (7,7), (8,1)]\n      shape: \"Scattered individual cells\"\n    - color: 5 (gray)\n      positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]\n      shape: \"Two vertical lines of length 3\"\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      positions: \"All other cells\"\n      shape: \"Background\"\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: 5x5\n  objects:\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      positions: [(0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4), (2,2)]\n      shape: \"Corners and center of a 5x5 square\"\n    - color: 5 (gray)\n      positions: [(1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)]\n      shape: \"Two vertical lines of length 3 at corners\"\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      positions: \"All other cells\"\n      shape: \"Background\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two main types of objects besides the background (color 0):\n    *   Azure (color 8) cells scattered throughout the grid.\n    *   Two vertical lines of gray (color 5) cells, each three cells long.\n\n2.  **Determine Core Pattern:** Notice that the output grid is smaller (5x5) than the input grid (9x9). The output appears to extract and rearrange a subset of the input's colored cells. Specifically, it takes some of the azure and gray cells.\n\n3.  **Describe Relative Positions:**\n    *   The output grid's corner cells (0,0), (0,4), (4,0), and (4,4) are azure (color 8). These correspond to the azure cells at the top-left area, top-center, lower-center and bottom left areas of the original input.\n    * The output also has an azure piece in its center (2,2) that corresponds to the color 8 at the top-right of the original input.\n    *   The two vertical lines of gray (color 5) cells are preserved in the output, but their positions change. In the input, they are at columns 1 and 5. In the output, they form the leftmost and rightmost columns.\n\n4. **Transformation rule**:\n    * Consider a 5x5 subgrid from the perspective of a 3x3 subgrid, so that we have a cross-shaped central part.\n    * Extract the subgrid given by `(row, column)` coordinates `(1,1), (1,8), (8,1), (3,3)` from the input. Place them in the output, on the four corners.\n    * The color 8 at the top-right area of the input is placed on the center of the output.\n    * Extract the two vertical lines in columns 1 and 5, from row 2 to row 4. Place them in the output's first and last columns, from row 1 to row 3.\n    * Fill all other output grid locations to color 0.\n"
