            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this new example.\n\n**YAML Description of Input Grids:**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  size: [3, 4]\n  objects:\n    - color: 3\n      positions: [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]]\n    - color: 0\n      positions: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 2], [2, 3]]\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: [6, 8]\n  objects:\n    - color: 3\n      positions: [[0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 1], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 6], [2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 5], [2, 6], [2, 7], [3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 5], [3, 6], [3, 7], [4, 1], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 6], [5, 2], [5, 3], [5, 4], [5, 5]]\n    - color: 0\n      positions: # All remaining positions\n        - ...\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid has two objects: areas with color 3 (green) and areas with color 0 (white).\n\n2.  **Expansion:** The size of the grid is doubled. Height becomes 3 * 2 = 6, and width becomes 4 * 2 = 8.\n\n3.  **Replication with Modification**: The original pattern of the green '3' pixels is mostly preserved within the expanded output grid.\n    The green pixels are replicated, but there are now 2x2 squares in places where pixels were adjacents in the original input.\n\n4.  **Fill**: The positions that were previously 0 in the input are also scaled and they are maintained as 0 after replication.\n\n**Elaboration**\n\nThe transformation is very similar to the first example. The differences are the colors and the pattern in wich pixels are kept. Here, adjacent pixels are expanded.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule scales the input grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\nIt replicates 2x2 squares of the input color (3, green) wherever two pixels were orthogonally adjacent.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.zeros((rows * 2, cols * 2), dtype=int)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            output_grid[2*i, 2*j] = input_grid[i,j]\n            output_grid[2*i+1, 2*j] = input_grid[i,j]\n            output_grid[2*i, 2*j+1] = input_grid[i,j]\n            output_grid[2*i+1, 2*j+1] = input_grid[i,j]\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n\n```\n"
