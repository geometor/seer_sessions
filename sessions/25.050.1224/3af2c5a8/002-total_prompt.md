Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Input Grids:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: [3, 4]
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [[0, 2], [1, 1], [1, 3], [2, 2]]
    - color: 0
      positions: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 3], [1, 0], [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 3]]

output_grid:
  size: [6, 8]
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [[0, 2], [0, 5], [1, 1], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 6], [2, 2], [2, 5], [3, 2], [3, 5], [4, 1], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 6], [5, 2], [5, 5]]
    - color: 0
      positions: # All the remaining positions not occupied by color 8
        -  ...

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of two objects: areas of color 8 (azure) and areas of color 0 (white).

2.  **Expansion:** The entire input grid is scaled by a factor of 2. The width is multiplied by 2 (4 * 2 = 8), and the height by 2 (3 * 2 = 6) resulting in an output that is doubled in size.

3. **Replication**: The shape made by the azure colored pixels in the input is preserved, every '8' pixel from input is kept in the output.

4. **Fill**: The positions that were previously 0 in the input are maintained as 0 after replication. The expanded layout is respected.

**Elaboration**

The transformation rule is essentially a scaling operation. It's a combination of duplication and expansion, with the core azure shape being preserved and enlarged, and the empty spaces scaling accordingly.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
