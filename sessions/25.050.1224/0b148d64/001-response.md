Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  - input_grid:
      size: 21x21
      objects:
        - color: 8 (azure)
          count: 79
          shape: irregular, scattered
        - color: 0 (white)
          count: 160
          shape: irregular, scattered
        - color: 2 (red)
          count: 95
          shape: large, contiguous block in the bottom left
        - color: 3 (green)
          count: 0
        - color: 1 (blue)
          count: 0
          
  - output_grid:
      size: 10x10
      objects:
        - color: 2 (red)
          count: 91
          shape: fills most of the grid
        - color: 0 (white)
          count: 9
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify the Region of Interest:** The output grid corresponds to the bottom-left corner of the input grid. We need to find the dimensions and location of the cropping.

2.  **Cropping:** Observe that the input area includes 11 empty rows (all 0s) from line 10. Also observe that the bottom-left square in the input of color 2 (red) is of dimension 10. The program crops a 10x10 square.

3. **Copy the relevant part:** The output is exactly this 10x10 sub-part of the input.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

The output grid is a 10x10 section extracted from the bottom-left corner of the 21x21 input grid. No other transformations.
