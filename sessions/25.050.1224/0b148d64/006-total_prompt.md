Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  - input_grid:
      size: 21x21
      objects:
        - color: 8 (azure)
          count: 79
          shape: irregular, scattered
        - color: 0 (white)
          count: 160
          shape: irregular, scattered
        - color: 2 (red)
          count: 95
          shape: large, contiguous block in the bottom left
        - color: 3 (green)
          count: 0
        - color: 1 (blue)
          count: 0
          
  - output_grid:
      size: 10x10
      objects:
        - color: 2 (red)
          count: 91
          shape: fills most of the grid
        - color: 0 (white)
          count: 9
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify the Region of Interest:** The output grid corresponds to the bottom-left corner of the input grid. We need to find the dimensions and location of the cropping.

2.  **Cropping:** Observe that the input area includes 11 empty rows (all 0s) from line 10. Also observe that the bottom-left square in the input of color 2 (red) is of dimension 10. The program crops a 10x10 square.

3. **Copy the relevant part:** The output is exactly this 10x10 sub-part of the input.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

The output grid is a 10x10 section extracted from the bottom-left corner of the 21x21 input grid. No other transformations.

```python
"""
The output grid is a 10x10 section extracted from the bottom-left corner of the 21x21 input grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Extracts a 10x10 subgrid from the bottom-left corner of the input grid.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Determine the dimensions of the input grid.
    rows, cols = input_array.shape

    # Define the size of the output grid.
    output_size = 10

    # Extract the 10x10 subgrid from the bottom-left.
    output_grid = input_array[rows-output_size:, :output_size]
    
    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in this second task.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  - input_grid:
      size: 17x19
      objects:
        - color: 2 (red)
          count: 60
          shape: irregular, scattered
        - color: 0 (white)
          count: 220
          shape: irregular, scattered
        - color: 3 (green)
          count: 43
          shape: contiguous block in the bottom right
  - output_grid:
      size: 7x9
      objects:

          count: 43
          shape: fills the grid
        - color: 0 (white)
          count: 20

```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify the Region of Interest:** The output grid seems to be related to the bottom-right section of the input grid where color 3 (green) appears.

2.  **Cropping:**
     The input grid has many empty rows (filled by '0') on top. The relevant data of the grid starts at row 12. The block of color 3 is also identifiable. Its size is 7x9.

3. **Copy the relevant part:** The output is exactly the sub-part of dimension 7x9 including color 3.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

The output grid is a 7x9 section extracted from the bottom-right part of the 17x19 input grid. It focuses on the region containing the green (color 3) objects.

```python
"""
The output grid is a 7x9 section extracted from the bottom-right part of the input grid,
specifically containing the contiguous block of color 3.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """

    """
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_array.shape

    output_rows = 7
    output_cols = 9

    output_grid = input_array[rows-output_rows:, cols-output_cols:]

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids for this task.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  - input_grid:
      size: 19x17
      objects:
        - color: 1 (blue)
          count: 65
        - color: 0 (white)
          count: 207
        - color: 4 (yellow)
          count: 51
  - output_grid:
      size: 9x6
      objects:
        - color: 4 (yellow)
          count: 36
        - color: 0 (white)
          count: 18
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify the Region of Interest:** The output grid corresponds to a section of the input grid related to color '4' (yellow).

2.  **Cropping:** The input grid has many empty rows (filled by '0') on top. The relevant data of the grid starts at row 11. The program extracts the subgrid of color 4 with additional rows of '0'.

3. **Determine dimensions:** The subpart containing the yellow color has 6 rows and 6 columns, plus 3 additional rows of 0s below.

4. **Copy the relevant part:** The output is exactly the sub-part of dimension 9x6 of the input, containing color 4.

**Step-by-step explanation:**
The output grid consists of a 9x6 rectangle extracted from the input grid. The upper part of the rectangle is defined by the block of color 4, and the rows below this part are the 0s.

```python
"""
The output grid is a 9x6 section extracted from the input grid,
specifically containing the contiguous block of color 4 and rows of 0s below.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Extracts a 9x6 subgrid from the input.
    """
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_array.shape
    
    # Find the first row containing color 4.
    first_row_with_4 = -1
    for i in range(rows):
        if 4 in input_array[i]:
            first_row_with_4 = i
            break

    output_rows = 9
    output_cols = 6

    output_grid = input_array[first_row_with_4:first_row_with_4 + output_rows, :output_cols]
    
    return output_grid.tolist()

```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
