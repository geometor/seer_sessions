We need to find the dimensions and location of the cropping.\n\n2.  **Cropping:** Observe that the input area includes 11 empty rows (all 0s) from line 10. Also observe that the bottom-left square in the input of color 2 (red) is of dimension 10. The program crops a 10x10 square.\n\n3. **Copy the relevant part:** The output is exactly this 10x10 sub-part of the input.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\nThe output grid is a 10x10 section extracted from the bottom-left corner of the 21x21 input grid. No other transformations.\n"
