The output is a 1x3 grid with cells ordered by color code: yellow (4), red (2), and azure (8).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_distinct_colors(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of distinct colors present in the grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sorted(np.unique(grid).tolist())\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid into a 1x3 grid representing the distinct colors.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the distinct colors from the input grid\n    distinct_colors = get_distinct_colors(input_grid)\n\n    #Initialize the output grid as 1xN array,\n    #with N being the number of unique colors.\n    \n    output_grid = np.array(distinct_colors).reshape(1,-1)\n\n    # remove all colors different than 2, 4 and 8.\n    \n    output_grid = output_grid[np.isin(output_grid, [2,4,8])]\n    \n    # sort them in the order 4, 2, 8.\n    \n    order = [4,2,8]\n    \n    output_grid = np.array([x for x in order if x in output_grid]).reshape(1,-1)    \n    \n    return output_grid\n```\n"
