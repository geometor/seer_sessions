Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [14, 16]
  objects:
    yellow_region:
      color: 4
      shape: rectangle
      position: top-left corner
      dimensions: [14, 7]
    red_region:
      color: 2
      shape: rectangle
      position: center
      dimensions: [14,7]
    azure_region:
      color: 8
      shape: rectangle
      position: bottom-right corner
      dimensions: [14, 2]
    

output_grid:
  dimensions: [1, 3]
  objects:
    yellow_cell:
      color: 4
      shape: single cell
      position: left
    red_cell:
      color: 2
      shape: single cell
      position: middle
    azure_cell:
      color: 8
      shape: single cell
      position: right
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**
1.  **Identify Distinct Colored Regions:** The input grid is initially composed of three distinct rectangular regions of color: yellow (4), red (2), and azure (8).

2.  **Represent Each Color:** For each distinct color present in the input grid, create a single cell in the output grid.

3. **Order in output**: Order from left to right, the identified objects by the color code.

4.  **Final Output:** The output grid is a 1x3 grid, with each cell representing one of the distinct colors from the input grid, maintaining the identified order: yellow (4), red (2) and azure (8).

**In summary:** The transformation rule consists of taking a set of regions identified by their color, and produce an ordered sequence of the identified color codes.
