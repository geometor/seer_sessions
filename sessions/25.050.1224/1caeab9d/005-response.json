The blue rectangle stays in place, the red rectangle moves down one row, and the yellow rectangle moves up one row. This results in all three rectangles being aligned in the third and fourth rows of the output grid, maintaining their original column positions.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects_2x1(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds 2x1 rectangle objects in the grid.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows - 1):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            rectangle = grid[r:r+2, c:c+1]\n            if np.all(rectangle == rectangle[0,0]) and rectangle[0,0] != 0:\n                objects.append({'color': rectangle[0,0], 'position': (r, c)})\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by moving the 2x1 rectangles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output grid as a zero array with the same shape as the input\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Find the 2x1 rectangle objects\n    objects = find_objects_2x1(input_grid)\n    \n    #Move each object according to the observed rule\n    for obj in objects:\n        color = obj['color']\n        r, c = obj['position']\n        \n        if color==1: #blue\n            new_row = 2\n        elif color == 2: #red\n            new_row = 2\n        elif color == 4: # yellow\n            new_row = 2\n            \n        output_grid[new_row:new_row+2, c:c+1] = color\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
