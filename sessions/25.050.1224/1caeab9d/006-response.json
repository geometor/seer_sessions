Now the two red cells construct a 2x1 rectangle.\n    *   The yellow object remain in place.\n    * The objects are re-arranged to reside in rows 2 and 3\n\n3.  **Result:** The output grid contains:\n    * A blue 2x1 rectangle at (2,1).\n    *  A red 2x1 rectangle at (2,3)\n    *   A yellow 2x1 rectangle at (2,6).\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\nRestructure the red cells to form a contiguous 2x1 rectangle. And put them to row 2.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation involves identifying the blue, red, and yellow single cells/objects and arranging them into 2x1 rectangles in the output grid at row 2 (index 2). The blue and yellow 2x1 retangles maintain their column. The two separated red cells are combined together into a 2x1 rectangle at row 2.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects_and_single_cells(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds 2x1 rectangle objects and separate single cells in the grid.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    single_cells={}\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    \n    #find 2x1 objects\n    for r in range(rows - 1):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            rectangle = grid[r:r+2, c:c+1]\n            if np.all(rectangle == rectangle[0,0]) and rectangle[0,0] != 0:\n                objects.append({'color': rectangle[0,0], 'position': (r, c), 'shape':(2,1)})\n\n    #find single cell\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r,c]!=0:\n                flag=True\n                for obj in objects:\n                    if r>=obj['position'][0] and r<=obj['position'][0]+obj['shape'][0]-1 and c==obj['position'][1]:\n                        flag=False\n                        break\n                if flag:\n                    single_cells[(r,c)]=grid[r,c]\n\n    return objects, single_cells\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by moving the colored cells and aligning them at row 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output grid as a zero array with the same shape as the input\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Find the 2x1 rectangle objects and single cells.\n    objects, single_cells = find_objects_and_single_cells(input_grid)\n\n    \n    #Move each object according to the observed rule\n    for obj in objects:\n        color = obj['color']\n        r, c = obj['position']\n        \n        if color==1: #blue\n            new_row = 2\n            output_grid[new_row:new_row+2, c:c+1] = color\n        elif color == 4: # yellow\n            new_row = 2\n            output_grid[new_row:new_row+2, c:c+1] = color\n            \n    #Move single cells\n    red_cells=[]\n    for pos, color in single_cells.items():\n        r, c = pos\n        if color==2:\n            red_cells.append((r,c))\n            \n    #construct 2x1 red rectangle\n    if len(red_cells)==2:\n        output_grid[2:4, red_cells[0][1]:red_cells[0][1]+1] = 2\n        \n    return output_grid\n```\n"
