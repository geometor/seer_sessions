Okay, let's analyze the second example's transformation.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_objects:
  - color: 1 (blue)
    position: (2, 6)
    shape: single cell
  - color: 4 (yellow)
    position: (7, 5)
    shape: single cell
output_objects:
  - color: 1 (blue)
    shape: 10x2 frame (top and bottom) and two 3x1 lines
  - color: 4 (yellow)
    shape: 10x2 frame (top and bottom) and two 3x1 lines
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Single Cells:** Locate all single-cell objects in the input grid. In this case, we find two: a blue (1) cell at (2, 6) and a yellow (4) cell at (7, 5).

2.  **Expand and frame based on color:**
    *   If the object is blue (1), replicate it to top and bottom row. Then draw two lines, 3 cells down from the top, and 3 cells up from the bottom.
    *   If the object is yellow (4), replicate it to top and bottom row. Then draw two lines, 3 cells down from the top, and 3 cells up from the bottom.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule is consistent with the previous example.  It involves taking each single-cell object in the input, and create frame and columns, depending on the original cell color. The position of the identified single cell determines at what height we draw the vertical bars.
