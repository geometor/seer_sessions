Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**Observations and Documentation (YAML)**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 21x21
  objects:
    - color: 0
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 24
    - color: 1
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 12
    - color: 2
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 48
    - color: 3
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 40
    - color: 4
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 24
    - color: 5
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 49
    - color: 6
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 44
    - color: 7
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 0
    - color: 8
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 0
    - color: 9
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 0

output_grid:
  size: 21x21
  objects:
    - color: 0
      shape: All the positions where the color was 0 are now the color that existed in the input.
      count: 0
    - color: 1
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 12
    - color: 2
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 48
    - color: 3
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 40
    - color: 4
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 24
    - color: 5
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 49
    - color: 6
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 44
      - color: 7
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 0
    - color: 8
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 0
    - color: 9
      shape: irregular, dispersed
      count: 0
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule (Natural Language Program)**

1.  **Identify Zero-Colored Cells:** Locate all cells in the input grid that have the color value '0' (white).

2. **Remove Zero Coloured Cells:** All the positions with color 0 are replaced with the color that occupied that position in the input grid.

**General Rule:** The output is created by replacing every cell of color 0 in the input to a cell in the previous position.
