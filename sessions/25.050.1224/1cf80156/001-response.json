One rectangle is in the 3rd row and one in the 5th row.\n      position: Centered horizontally, spanning rows 3-6.\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      shape: Background\n      position: Everywhere else.\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: 4x4\n  objects:\n    - color: 2 (red)\n      shape: Multiple 1x1 squares\n      position: Occupying a checkerboard pattern.\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      shape: Multiple 1x1 squares\n      position: Occupying a checkerboard pattern.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify the Object:** In the input grid, locate the single contiguous object composed of red (color 2) cells.\n\n2.  **Isolate:** Disregard background white pixels.\n\n3. **Bounding Box:** find the smallest rectangle containing the red object.\n\n4.  **Crop and Resize:** Extract the object within bounding box, and resize the object to 4x4.\n\n5. **Checkerboard:** within this resized region, all red pixels stay red and white pixels are replaced by a chekerboard pattern.\n\n**Explanation and Reasoning**\n\nThe core transformation involves isolating the non-background object (the red shape), finding its bounding box, and reducing it to a smaller, patterned square. The final 4x4 is filled with checkerboard pattern where the original pixels of the shape are located.\n\nThis natural language program sufficiently describes the input to output transformation.\n"
