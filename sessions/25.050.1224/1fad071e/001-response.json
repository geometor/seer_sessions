The blue and red colors create squares (composed by 4 cells of same color). The rest of the cells are white (color 0), and they form an irregular shape.\n\n2.  **Predicate:** The predicate of interest is location and shape. There is not an agent.\n\n3.  **Filter specific objects:** Select the first two blue objects starting from the upper left corner and scanning each row from left to right.\n    The two selected blue objects have coordiantes:\n      - [[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1], [2, 2]]\n      - [[0, 8]]\n\n4.  **Extract a Property:** List of the unique x-coordinates occupied by selected blue objects.\n     - [1,2]\n     - [8]\n\n5.  **Build the output:** Create an output of length equal to the double of the previous list plus one. Put 1 in each cell of the output that have index included in the list, and zero otherwise.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation consists on:\n   - scanning the grid from left to right and from top to bottom.\n   - selecting the first two blue objects.\n   - extracting the x-coordinates of their cells.\n   - removing duplicates,\n   - creating a new grid 1 row grid\n   - setting its values to 1 when their index exists in the x-coordinates list or 0 otherwise.\n"
