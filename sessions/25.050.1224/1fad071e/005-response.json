We are only interested in blue objects.\n\n2.  **Predicate:** The predicate of interest is object order based on a top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan.\n\n3. **Filter Objects:**  Select the first two blue objects, scanning the cells from top to bottom and from left to right.\n    - [[0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 3], [1, 4]]\n    - [[1, 7], [1, 8], [2, 7], [2, 8]]\n\n4.  **Extract a Property:** List the unique x-coordinates occupied by selected blue objects.\n      - [3,4]\n      - [7,8]\n\n5.  **Build the output:** Create an output of length equal to the double of the previous list plus one. Put 1 in each cell of the output that have index included in the list, and zero otherwise.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation is identical to the first and second example.\nThe new rule is:\n   - scanning the grid from left to right and from top to bottom.\n   - selecting the first two blue objects.\n   - extracting the x-coordinates of their cells.\n   - removing duplicates,\n   - creating a new grid 1 row grid\n   - setting its values to 1 when their index exists in the x-coordinates list or 0 otherwise.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation is identical to the first and second example.\nThe new rule is:\n   - scanning the grid from left to right and from top to bottom.\n   - selecting the first two blue objects.\n   - extracting the x-coordinates of their cells.\n   - removing duplicates,\n   - creating a new grid 1 row grid\n   - setting its values to 1 when their index exists in the x-coordinates list or 0 otherwise.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find objects of a specific color in the grid.\n    Returns a list of lists of coordinates.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n\n    def is_valid(x, y):\n        return 0 <= x < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= y < grid.shape[1]\n\n    def dfs(x, y, current_object):\n        if (x, y) in visited or not is_valid(x, y) or grid[x, y] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((x, y))\n        current_object.append((x, y))\n        \n        # Explore adjacent cells\n        dfs(x + 1, y, current_object)\n        dfs(x - 1, y, current_object)\n        dfs(x, y + 1, current_object)\n        dfs(x, y - 1, current_object)\n\n    for x in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for y in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[x, y] == color and (x, y) not in visited:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(x, y, current_object)\n                objects.append(current_object)\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Find blue objects\n    blue_objects = get_objects(input_grid, 1)\n\n    # Select the first two blue objects\n    selected_objects = blue_objects[:2]\n\n    # Extract x-coordinates\n    x_coordinates = []\n    for obj in selected_objects:\n        for x, y in obj:\n            x_coordinates.append(y)\n\n    # Remove duplicates\n    unique_x_coordinates = sorted(list(set(x_coordinates)))\n\n    #create output grid\n    output_length = len(unique_x_coordinates)*2+1\n    output_grid = np.zeros(output_length, dtype=int)\n\n    #set 1\n    for x in unique_x_coordinates:\n      output_grid[x] = 1\n\n    return output_grid.reshape(1,-1)\n```\n"
