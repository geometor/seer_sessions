Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: [9, 9]
  objects:
    blue:
      - shape: irregular
        positions: [[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1], [2, 2], [6,5], [6,6], [5,5], [5,6], [0,8], [8,1], [8,8]]
    red:
      - shape: square
        positions: [[0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 4], [1, 5]]
      - shape: square
        positions: [[2, 7], [2, 8], [3, 7], [3, 8]]
      - shape: square
        positions: [[4, 2], [4, 3], [5, 2], [5, 3]]
    white:
      - shape: background
        positions: all other cells
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation, focusing on objects, predicates, and actions:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe objects of three colors, blue, red, and white. The blue and red colors create squares (composed by 4 cells of same color). The rest of the cells are white (color 0), and they form an irregular shape.

2.  **Predicate:** The predicate of interest is location and shape. There is not an agent.

3.  **Filter specific objects:** Select the first two blue objects starting from the upper left corner and scanning each row from left to right.
    The two selected blue objects have coordiantes:
      - [[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1], [2, 2]]
      - [[0, 8]]

4.  **Extract a Property:** List of the unique x-coordinates occupied by selected blue objects.
     - [1,2]
     - [8]

5.  **Build the output:** Create an output of length equal to the double of the previous list plus one. Put 1 in each cell of the output that have index included in the list, and zero otherwise.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation consists on:
   - scanning the grid from left to right and from top to bottom.
   - selecting the first two blue objects.
   - extracting the x-coordinates of their cells.
   - removing duplicates,
   - creating a new grid 1 row grid
   - setting its values to 1 when their index exists in the x-coordinates list or 0 otherwise.
