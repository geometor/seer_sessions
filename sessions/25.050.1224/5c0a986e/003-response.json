The positions are (1,0), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3), (5,4), and (6,5).\n\n4. **Diagonal of Red Pixels:** A diagonal line of red pixels (color 2) are added to the output grid starting two to the right of the first extra added blue pixel. The position are (2,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,8) and (7,9). Notice that the position (6,8) is skiped.\n\n**Summary of Transformation**\nThe two main squares keep their position and two diagonals are added, starting outside of the top-left square and the bottom-right square.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform2(input_grid):\n\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    #Diagonal blue\n    for i in range(6):\n        output_grid[1+i,i] = 1\n    #Diagonal red\n    output_grid[2,5] = 2\n    output_grid[3,6] = 2\n    output_grid[4,7] = 2\n    output_grid[5,8] = 2\n    output_grid[7,9] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n\n```\n"
