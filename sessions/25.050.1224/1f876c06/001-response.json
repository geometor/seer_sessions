From each seed, use the following steps to generate the diagonal:\n   * define a line segment with slope 1 and origin at the seed cell.\n   * let `k` be the row index of the seed.\n   * if `k` < 5, extend the line by drawing 4 more cells\n   * otherwise, draw cells until the end of the grid.\n   \n\nIn summary, the transformation rule takes each isolated colored cell in the input and extends it diagonally (down and to the right) by a certain number of cells based on its row index.\n"
