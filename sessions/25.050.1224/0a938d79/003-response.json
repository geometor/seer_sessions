It replicates single-cell objects across the grid in a specific pattern.\n\n1.  **Identify Initial Objects**: There are two single-cell objects in the input grid, one with color 1 and another with color 3.\n\n2.  **Determine Replication Pattern**:\n    *   The object with color 1 (initially at position (0, 5)) is replicated vertically down and then repeated every 5 columns.\n    *   The object with color 3 (initially at position (6, 8)) is replicated vertically down and then repeated every 5 columns.\n\n3. **Vertical Replication and Columns creation:** Each cell is the source of a new object, and each object replicates vertically down.\n\n4. **Horizontal Replication and Columns creation:** Both initial single cells objects creates are replicated horizontally in a repeating pattern.\n\nIn summary, the same \"stamping\" rule is applied: single instances of colors are stamped vertically, and the results are repeated horizontally every 5 columns.\n"
