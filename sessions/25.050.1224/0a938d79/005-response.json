This one differs significantly from the previous two.\n\n**YAML Summary of Observations**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  dimensions: [22, 9]\n  objects:\n    - color: 2\n      position: [5, 0]\n      shape: single cell\n    - color: 3\n      position: [7, 8]\n      shape: single cell\n  background_color: 0\n\noutput_grid:\n  dimensions: [22, 9]\n  objects:\n    - color: 2\n      positions: [[5 + 4*j, i] for i in range(9) for j in range (4)]\n      shape: single cells forming rows\n    - color: 3\n      positions: [[7+ 4*j, i] for i in range(9) for j in range (4)]\n      shape: single cells forming rows\n  background_color: 0\n```\n\n**Natural Language Description of Transformation**\n\nThe transformation in this example involves replicating the initial objects (single cells of color 2 and 3) *horizontally* and then repeating the generated rows at specific intervals.\n\n1.  **Identify Initial Objects**: The input grid contains two single-cell objects: one of color 2 at position (5, 0) and one of color 3 at position (7, 8).\n\n2.  **Horizontal Replication**:\n    *   The object with color 2 is replicated across the entire row (row 5).\n    *   The object with color 3 is replicated across the entire row (row 7).\n\n3.  **Vertical Pattern Repetition**:\n     *   The row with color 2 (row 5) is repeated every 4 rows, starting from its initial position.\n     *   The row with color 3 (row 7) is repeated every 4 rows, starting from its initial position.\n\nIn summary, the single color instances are expanded *horizontally* to fill their respective rows. Then those filled rows are repeated downwards every four rows.  This is different from the previous two, which replicated vertically first and then horizontally. The order of replication matters.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation involves replicating the initial objects horizontally and then repeating the generated rows at specific intervals.\n\n1.  **Identify Initial Objects**: The input grid contains two single-cell objects: one of color 2 and one of color 3.\n\n2.  **Horizontal Replication**:\n    *   The object with color 2 is replicated across the entire row (row 5).\n    *   The object with color 3 is replicated across the entire row (row 7).\n\n3.  **Vertical Pattern Repetition**:\n     *    The row with color 2 (row 5) is repeated every 4 rows downwards.\n     *   The row with color 3 (row 7) is repeated every 4 rows downwards.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Find initial objects\n    initial_objects = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] != 0:\n                initial_objects.append(((r, c), input_grid[r, c]))\n\n    # Replicate horizontally and then vertically\n    for obj in initial_objects:\n        pos, color = obj\n        initial_row, _ = pos\n\n        # Horizontal replication\n        for c in range(cols):\n            output_grid[initial_row, c] = color\n        \n        # Vertical repetition\n        for i in range(1,(rows - initial_row) // 4 + 1):\n            new_row = initial_row + 4 * i\n            if new_row < rows :\n               for c in range(cols):\n                    output_grid[new_row,c] = color\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
