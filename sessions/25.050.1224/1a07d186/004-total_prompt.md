**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Persistent Objects:** There are two primary persistent objects: a green vertical line (color 3) in column 4 and a yellow vertical line (color 4) in column 13. These remain unchanged in terms of shape, color, and position.

2.  **Copy, move and change color**: Every other color, different from 3 and 4 will:

    *   Be deleted if they exist.
    *    If they are green or yellow, two copies of them must be made next to the green and yellow columns respectively, to the right of the green column and to the left of the yellow one.

**Step-by-step explanation based on the example:**

*   The red cell (2) is removed.
*    The single green cell at (12,17) will be moved to (12,5)
*    The single yellow cell at (4,2) will be moved to (4,14) and (8,12).


```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Two vertical lines, one green (color 3) in column 4 and one yellow (color 4) in column 13, remain unchanged.
2. Every other color, different from 3 and 4 will:
    *   Be deleted if they exist.

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Persistent Objects:** There are two main persistent objects that mostly keep the same properties:

    *   A red horizontal line (color 2) on row 4.
    *   A blue horizontal line (color 1) on row 11.
2.  Move up by one row those objects.
3.  **Process Single Cells by Color:**
    *   Single red cells (color 2) which are not on row 4 are moved to either row above or row below object 1 (red horizontal line).
    *   Single blue cells (color 1) which are not on row 11 are moved to the row below object 2 (blue horizontal line).
    *   Delete any single cell not being object 1 or object 2.

**Step-by-step explanation based on the example:**

*   The red horizontal line moves up 1 row.
*   The blue horizontal line moves up 1 row.
*   Red single cell in (1,4) moves down to (3,4).
*   The blue cell (6, 11) moves down to (12, 3).
*   The red cell (8, 7) goes up to (5,7).
*  The red cell (14, 11) is moved up to (5,11)
*   The blue cell (14,3) moves to (12,3)
*   The single yellow cell at (2,10) is deleted.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # change output pixels
