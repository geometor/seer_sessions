These remain unchanged in terms of shape, color, and position.\n\n2.  **Copy, move and change color**: Every other color, different from 3 and 4 will:\n\n    *   Be deleted if they exist.\n    *    If they are green or yellow, two copies of them must be made next to the green and yellow columns respectively, to the right of the green column and to the left of the yellow one.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation based on the example:**\n\n*   The red cell (2) is removed.\n*    The single green cell at (12,17) will be moved to (12,5)\n*    The single yellow cell at (4,2) will be moved to (4,14) and (8,12).\n\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\n1. Two vertical lines, one green (color 3) in column 4 and one yellow (color 4) in column 13, remain unchanged.\n2.
