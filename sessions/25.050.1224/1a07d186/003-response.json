Move up by one row those objects.\n3.  **Process Single Cells by Color:**\n    *   Single red cells (color 2) which are not on row 4 are moved to either row above or row below object 1 (red horizontal line).\n    *   Single blue cells (color 1) which are not on row 11 are moved to the row below object 2 (blue horizontal line).\n    *   Delete any single cell not being object 1 or object 2.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation based on the example:**\n\n*   The red horizontal line moves up 1 row.\n*   The blue horizontal line moves up 1 row.\n*   Red single cell in (1,4) moves down to (3,4).\n*   The blue cell (6, 11) moves down to (12, 3).\n*   The red cell (8, 7) goes up to (5,7).\n*  The red cell (14, 11) is moved up to (5,11)\n*   The blue cell (14,3) moves to (12,3)\n*   The single yellow cell at (2,10) is deleted.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule.\n    The transformation rule is as follows:\n    1.
