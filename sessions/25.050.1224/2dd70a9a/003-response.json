Now, with index row = 3, the first azure in this row is taken as center for the expansion, and the green cells grow to the right until it finds another object of color 8.\n    The next green object comes from the average position of two new greens, the ones closest to the next azure block: index row (4+5)/2 = 4.5 = 4.\n    In this row, green will expand from the azure cell to the right until reaching another color 8 or the border.\n\n**Summary of the refined rule**\n1.  **Static Objects:** The red cells (color 2) and azure cells (color 8) remain unchanged in their original positions.\n\n2.  **Green Object Identification:** Identify the green cells (color 3).\n\n3. **Expansion procedure:**\n   - Compute the integer average row index between two green cells.\n   - If there is an azure block in this row, use this block as a \"seed\" for the green expansion.\n   - Grow the green region horizontally to the right of the seed, and to the left, until the border or an object with color 8 is encountered.\n   - Repeat with a new pair of green cells.\n"
