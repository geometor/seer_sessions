Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2 # Red
      positions: [(0, 1)]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 8 # Azure
      positions: [(0, 5)]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 0 # Black
      positions: All other cells
      shape: background

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2 # Red
      positions: [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2,1), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4,1), (5, 0), (5, 2)]
      shape: Pattern resembling '3' or mirrored 'E'
    - color: 8 # Azure
      positions: [(0, 5), (1, 4), (1,6), (2,5), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4,5), (5, 4), (5, 6)]
      shape: Pattern resembling '3' or mirrored 'E'
    - color: 0 # Black
      positions: All other cells
      shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Initial Objects:** In the input grid, we have two single-cell objects: a red object (color 2) at position (0, 1) and an azure object (color 8) at position (0, 5). The rest of the grid is filled with black (color 0) which acts as the background.

2.  **Replicate and Transform:** The transformation replicates each of the colored cells (2 and 8) and creates a mirrored "E" or "3" shaped pattern.

3.  **Specific Pattern Formation:**
    *   The red cell at (0,1) is the starting point of the pattern. The pattern for color 2 extends downwards, creating an additional column of 2s to the left and right. The pattern includes cells at positions: (1,0), (1,2), (3,0), (3,2), (5,0), and (5,2) around it.

    * The azure cell at (0, 5) acts as a similar seed. It extends downwards. The pattern contains two columns of 8s. The new object include cells located at coordinates: (1,4), (1,6), (3,4), (3,6), (5,4), and (5,6)

4. **Background Remains:** The black background (color 0) remains unchanged in all cells not occupied by the new patterns.

**Complete Description:**
The colors 2 (red) and 8 (azure) are expanded into a 3x3 pattern that creates a shape like '3' and is repeated downwards every other row.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
