The rest of the grid is filled with black (color 0) which acts as the background.\n\n2.  **Replicate and Transform:** The transformation replicates each of the colored cells (2 and 8) and creates a mirrored \"E\" or \"3\" shaped pattern.\n\n3.  **Specific Pattern Formation:**\n    *   The red cell at (0,1) is the starting point of the pattern. The pattern for color 2 extends downwards, creating an additional column of 2s to the left and right. The pattern includes cells at positions: (1,0), (1,2), (3,0), (3,2), (5,0), and (5,2) around it.\n\n    * The azure cell at (0, 5) acts as a similar seed. It extends downwards. The pattern contains two columns of 8s. The new object include cells located at coordinates: (1,4), (1,6), (3,4), (3,6), (5,4), and (5,6)\n\n4. **Background Remains:** The black background (color 0) remains unchanged in all cells not occupied by the new patterns.\n\n**Complete Description:**\nThe colors 2 (red) and 8 (azure) are expanded into a 3x3 pattern that creates a shape like '3' and is repeated downwards every other row.\n\n"
