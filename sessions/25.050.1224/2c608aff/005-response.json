Let these column indices be `x1`, `x2`, etc.\n\n3.  **Conditional Red Cell Placement (Output):**\n    *   Examine the *output* grid. For each red cell in the input:\n        *   If, in the *input* grid, there is a red cell at a given column, check if column in the output grid has any yellow cell.\n        *   If not, place a red cell (or cells) in the *output* grid at 7th row at the corresponding column `xi`. If a column contains yellow cells in the output, the red block will be placed vertically on top of the yellow blocks in the output.\n\n4.  **Preserve Other Objects:** The yellow 4x4 square and the blue background (except where overwritten by red cells) are preserved from the input to the output.\n\n**Explanation of the Rule**\n\nThe positions of red cells are moved based on the existence of yellow cells vertically. If there are any yellow blocks in the same column, the red cell will be placed on top of it. If not, then it is placed on row 7.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_object(grid, color):\n    # Find coordinates of all cells with the given color\n    coords = np.argwhere(grid == color)\n    if coords.size == 0:\n        return None  # Return None if no object of the specified color is found\n    return coords\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the observed rule.\n    The positions of red cells are determined based on the positions of the yellow\n    square.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    red_coords_input = find_object(input_grid, 2)\n    yellow_coords_output = find_object(output_grid, 4)\n    yellow_columns = []\n\n    if yellow_coords_output is not None:\n      yellow_columns = np.unique(yellow_coords_output[:, 1])\n\n    if red_coords_input is not None:\n      for coord in red_coords_input:\n        x = coord[1]\n        output_grid[coord[0]][coord[1]] = 1\n        has_yellow = False\n        if yellow_coords_output is not None:\n            for y_coord in yellow_coords_output:\n                if y_coord[1] == x:\n                    #find topmost yellow block\n                    top_yellow = output_grid.shape[0]\n                    for yel_y in yellow_columns:\n                      if yel_y == x:\n                        for k in range(output_grid.shape[0]):\n                          if output_grid[k][yel_y] == 4:\n                            top_yellow = k\n                            break\n                        break\n\n                    output_grid[top_yellow-1][x] = 2\n                    has_yellow= True\n                    break\n        if not has_yellow:\n            output_grid[6][x] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
