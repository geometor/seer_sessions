Starting from the row of the azure block and going up, replace the cells in the same column (`x`) with azure (color `8`) until reaching row number 5 (inclusive).\n\n4. **Preserve other objects.** All other objects are kept as is (blue square and red background).\n\n**Explanation of the Rule**\n\nThe core transformation is the vertical extension of the single azure block. Starting from its original position, it expands upwards to row 5, effectively creating a vertical line of azure color, overwriting background color red. The blue block remains the same.\n"
