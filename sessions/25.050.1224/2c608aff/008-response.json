            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.\n\n**YAML Description**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  objects:\n    - color: 3 # Green\n      shape: 3x3 square\n      position: Centered horizontally, slightly above center vertically\n    - color: 4 # Yellow\n      shape: single cell\n      position: Varies, but appears within the horizontal bounds of the green square\n    - color: 8 # Azure\n      shape: Background\n      position: Fills the entire grid\n  relationships:\n    - The green square and yellow cell are distinct objects.\n    - The yellow cell's horizontal position seems related to the green square's horizontal span.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nHere's a step-by-step description of the transformation rule:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the contiguous block of color `3` (green) and the single cell of color `4` (yellow). Also, note the background is color `8` (azure).\n\n2. **Detect Horizontal Translation**: In the 4th row from top, detect the column number where the single yellow object is in the input grid. Let say it is `x`.\n\n3. **Horizontal Expansion:** Starting from column number `x` in the 4th row, replace four cells to the right including cell at `x` with the color of the single yellow object.\n\n4. **Preserve Other Objects:** All other objects are preserved. In this case the green object and azure background is preserved.\n\n**Explanation of the Rule**\n\nThe core of the rule is that the single yellow block extends to the right and become horizontally elongated. All other objects and background are preserved as is.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nA single yellow block extends to the right and become horizontally elongated. All other objects and background are preserved as is.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_object(grid, color):\n    # Find coordinates of all cells with the given color\n    coords = np.argwhere(grid == color)\n    if coords.size == 0:\n        return None  # Return None if no object of the specified color is found\n    return coords\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule:\n    A single yellow block extends to the right and become horizontally elongated.\n    All other objects and background are preserved as is.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    yellow_coords = find_object(input_grid, 4)\n\n    #find single yellow object\n    if yellow_coords is not None:\n        #get x coordinate\n        x = yellow_coords[0][1]\n\n        #modify four cells from x to right\n        row = 3\n        for i in range(4):\n          if x + i < output_grid.shape[1]:\n            output_grid[row][x + i] = 4\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
