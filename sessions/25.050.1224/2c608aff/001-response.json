Also, note the background is color `8` (azure).\n\n2. **Detect Horizontal Translation**: In the 4th row from top, detect the column number where the single yellow object is in the input grid. Let say it is `x`.\n\n3. **Horizontal Expansion:** Starting from column number `x` in the 4th row, replace four cells to the right including cell at `x` with the color of the single yellow object.\n\n4. **Preserve Other Objects:** All other objects are preserved. In this case the green object and azure background is preserved.\n\n**Explanation of the Rule**\n\nThe core of the rule is that the single yellow block extends to the right and become horizontally elongated. All other objects and background are preserved as is.\n"
