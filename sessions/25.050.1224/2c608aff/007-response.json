            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation in the fourth example.\n\n**YAML Description**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  objects:\n    - color: 1:  # Blue\n      shape: Background\n      position: Fills most of the grid.\n    - color: 4: # Yellow\n      shape: single cell\n      position: Appears scattered, seemingly randomly.\n    - color: 5: # Gray\n      shape: 4x5 rectangle (width x height)\n      position: Centered horizontally, spanning rows 6-9\n\n  relationships:\n    - The positions of the single yellow cells (color 4) seem to be important.\n    - The gray rectangle remains constant, suggesting a preservation rule.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nHere's the step-by-step description of the transformation rule:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the gray (color `5`) 4x5 rectangle, the scattered single yellow cells (color `4`), and the blue background (color `1`).\n\n2.  **Analyze Yellow Cell Positions:**  Note the positions of all single yellow cells (color `4`) in the *input* grid.\n\n3.  **Horizontal Extension (Yellow):** For *each* yellow cell found in the input:\n    *   Extend it *horizontally* to the left.\n    *    Replace cells with the yellow color (4) to its left until reaching (and including) the third column. The extension happens on the same row as the original yellow cell.\n\n4.  **Preserve Other Objects:**  The gray 4x5 rectangle (color `5`) is preserved.  The blue background (color `1`) is preserved, except where overwritten by the yellow extensions.\n\n**Explanation of the Rule**\n\nThe key transformation is the horizontal extension of *each* individual yellow cell to the left, up to the third column.  The gray rectangle and the rest of the blue background are kept as they are.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nEach yellow cell extends horizontally to the left up to the 3rd column.  The gray rectangle is preserved.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_object(grid, color):\n    # Find coordinates of all cells with the given color\n    coords = np.argwhere(grid == color)\n    if coords.size == 0:\n        return None  # Return None if no object of the specified color is found\n    return coords\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule:\n    Each yellow cell extends horizontally to the left, up to the third column.\n    The gray rectangle and other elements are preserved.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    yellow_coords = find_object(input_grid, 4)\n\n    if yellow_coords is not None:\n        for coord in yellow_coords:\n            row, col = coord\n            # Extend horizontally to the left up to the third column (index 2)\n            for i in range(2, col + 1):  # Inclusive of the starting column\n                output_grid[row][i] = 4\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
