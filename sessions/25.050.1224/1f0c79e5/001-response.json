Contains central blank\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct objects:\n    *   A yellow object that resembles a rotated \"L\" shape, constituted by two yellow cells at (6,3), (5,3) and one at (6,4) (using a 0-indexed row, column notation).\n    *   A single red cell, located at (5,4).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule (Predicates, actions, and changes):** The red object disappear, and at the same time, yellow object expands around its initial position. The yellow 'L' shape \"expands\" by replicating the '4' color. This extension forms a sort of upwards-pointing and leftwards 5x5 tilted \"arrowhead\", or an incomplete 5x5 rotated square, where is missing the 'bottom right' 3x3 sub-square. The bottom left corner of the final figure is placed at (1+k, 5-k) with k=4.\n\n**Explanation and Reasoning:**\n\nThe core of the transformation is the expansion and change of shape of the yellow object and the removing of the red object. The rule seems to dictate a specific pattern of expansion, not simply filling adjacent cells, but creating an almost symmetric shape centered around where yellow and red cells where initially in contact.\n"
