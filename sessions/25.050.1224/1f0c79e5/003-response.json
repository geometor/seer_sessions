            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this second transformation.\n\n**YAML Summary of Observations**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  dimensions: 9x9\n  objects:\n    - color: 3 (green)\n      shape: 2x1 rectangle + 1x1 square (L-shape)\n      position: (2,2), (1,2) and (2,3)  # (row, col) - zero indexed\n    - color: 2 (red)\n      shape: 1x1 square\n      position: (2,3)\n\noutput_grid:\n  dimensions: 9x9\n  objects:\n    - color: 3 (green)\n      shape: Roughly a 5x5 tilted square, bottom-right part, centered around the initial 'L'\n      position: The diagonal starts at (1,2) and extends downwards and to the right.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains:\n    *   A green \"L\" shaped object formed by three green cells located at (1,2), (2,2), and (2,3) using 0-indexed row, column notation.\n    *  A red cell at position (2,3)\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule (Predicates, actions, and changes):**\n    *   The red cell disappears.\n    *   The initial green L-shape object expands around its location. The green object grows into shape of a 5x5 tilted square where the upper left 3x3 sub-square is not present. The top left corner of the final figure is at (1,2).\n\n**Explanation and Reasoning:**\n\nThis transformation is very similar to the previous one. A small colored object (red) disappear, and another object of different color ('L' shaped) expands into a partial tilted squared centered on the original position of the 'L' shaped object. The only difference with the example before is the 'direction' of the tilted square (bottom-right instead of top-left).\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\n1. Identify a green \"L\" shaped object and a red cell in the input grid.\n2. Remove the red object.\n3. Expand the green object into a partial, downwards-pointing 5x5 tilted \"square\" shape.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_object(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds coordinates of cells with a specific color.\"\"\"\n    coords = []\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r,c] == color:\n                coords.append((r, c))\n    return coords\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # 1. Identify Objects\n    green_coords = find_object(input_grid, 3)\n    # red_coords = find_object(input_grid, 2)\n\n    # 2 & 3. Expand green and remove red\n    if len(green_coords) > 0:\n        start_row = green_coords[0][0]\n        start_col = green_coords[0][1]\n\n        for i in range(5):\n            for j in range(5):\n                row = start_row + i - j\n                col = start_col + i + j-1\n                if 0 <= row < output_grid.shape[0] and 0 <= col < output_grid.shape[1] and not(i<3 and j<3):\n                    output_grid[row, col] = 3\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
