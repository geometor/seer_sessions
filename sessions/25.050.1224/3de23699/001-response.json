The rest of the grid is filled with the background color (0).\n\n2.  **Focus on Yellow Objects:** The output grid primarily consists of yellow (4) cells. Observe the locations of the yellow objects in the input grid.\n\n3. **Corner Extraction:** The four yellow objects are situated at the four inside corners where inside refers to one cell in from the boundary of the 7 x 7 input grid.\n   - row index: 1, column index: 1\n   - row index: 1, column index: 5\n   - row index: 5, column index: 1\n   - row index: 5, column index: 5\n\n4. **Relative Positioning:** With respect to those four corners, form a 3x3 output matrix.\n   - position (1,1) transforms into position (0,0),\n   - position (1,5) transform into position (0,2),\n   - position (5,1) transforms into position (2,0),\n   - position (5,5) transforms into position (2,2).\n\n5.  **Fill Rule:** All elements of the 3x3 output matrix become yellow, except the corners (0,0) and (2,0) which become white.\n\nIn summary, the input is scanned for yellow dots situated one cell in from the outer boundary, and these positions determine the output grid, which fills every cell of a 3x3 grid yellow except (0,0) and (2,0) which become white. The red object in the input grid is ignored.\n"
