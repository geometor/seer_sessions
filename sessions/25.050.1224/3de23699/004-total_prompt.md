Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    yellow_objects:
      count: 4
      positions: [(1, 1), (1, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5)] # (row, col)
      shape: single cells
    red_object:
      count: 1
      positions: [(3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3)]
      shape: cross-like, centered
    background:
      color: 0

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    yellow_objects:
        count: 7
        positions:
          - all cells except (0,0) and (2,0)
        shape: 3 x 3 block (with 2 holes)
    background:
        color: 0
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two types of objects: yellow (4) single-cell objects and one red (2) cross-shaped object. The rest of the grid is filled with the background color (0).

2.  **Focus on Yellow Objects:** The output grid primarily consists of yellow (4) cells. Observe the locations of the yellow objects in the input grid.

3. **Corner Extraction:** The four yellow objects are situated at the four inside corners where inside refers to one cell in from the boundary of the 7 x 7 input grid.
   - row index: 1, column index: 1
   - row index: 1, column index: 5
   - row index: 5, column index: 1
   - row index: 5, column index: 5

4. **Relative Positioning:** With respect to those four corners, form a 3x3 output matrix.
   - position (1,1) transforms into position (0,0),
   - position (1,5) transform into position (0,2),
   - position (5,1) transforms into position (2,0),
   - position (5,5) transforms into position (2,2).

5.  **Fill Rule:** All elements of the 3x3 output matrix become yellow, except the corners (0,0) and (2,0) which become white.

In summary, the input is scanned for yellow dots situated one cell in from the outer boundary, and these positions determine the output grid, which fills every cell of a 3x3 grid yellow except (0,0) and (2,0) which become white. The red object in the input grid is ignored.

```python
"""
The transformation identifies the positions of yellow (4) cells in the input grid that are one cell in from the boundary. 
These positions determine the boundaries of a 3x3 output grid.
The output grid is filled with yellow (4) except for the top-left (0, 0) and bottom-left (2, 0) cells, which are filled with white (0).

    # Initialize the output grid as a 3x3 array filled with yellow (4).

    output_grid[2, 0] = 0

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 12x9
  objects:
    green_objects:
      count: 4
      positions: [(1, 1), (1, 7), (5, 1), (5, 7)]  # (row, col)
      shape: single cells
    red_object:
      count: 1
      positions: Several, forming a somewhat irregular shape in the center.
      shape: Irregular, not a simple geometric shape.
    background:
      color: 0

output_grid:
  size: 3x5
  objects:
    green_objects:
      count: 6
      positions: [(0,1),(0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (2,0), (2,3)]
      shape: Mostly single cells, except a 2x1 block on rows 0,1 and col 1
    background:
      color: 0
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we identify green (3) single-cell objects and one red (2) irregularly shaped object. The rest is the background (0).

2.  **Focus on Green Objects:**  Like the previous example, the transformation seems to be using the positions of the green objects.

3.  **Corner Extraction:** The four green objects are located one cell in from the corners of the grid.
    *   row index: 1, column index: 1
    *   row index: 1, column index: 7
    *   row index: 5, column index: 1
    *   row index: 5, column index: 7

4. **Resizing and mapping.** Consider that those green corner dots represent a sub-matrix within the larger input matrix. Compute its size and map it to the output:
    - input submatrix size = (5-1+1) x (7-1+1) = 5 x 7
    - we remap this to the 3x5 output matrix
    - Therefore:
      - input position (1,1) becomes (0,0) output
      - input position (1,7) becomes (0,4) output
      - input position (5,1) becomes (2,0) output
      - input position (5,7) becomes (2,4) output

5.  **Fill and Overwrite Rule:**
    *   Fill all cells of the 3x5 output matrix with color 0.
    *   Fill with color 3 output positions (0,0), (0,4), (2,0) and (2,4).
    *   Fill with color 3 output positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,1) and (1,2)

In summary, the input is scanned for green dots located one cell in from the outer boundary, and these positions delineate a sub-matrix, which after remapping defines a set of coordinates to be colored green in the output matrix.

```python
"""
The transformation identifies the positions of green (3) cells in the input grid that are one cell in from the input boundary.
These positions are remapped to a 3x5 output matrix.
The output grid is filled with green color at the mapped positions, as well as filling with green positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,1) and (1,2).

    for r, c in corners:
       out_r = 0 if r==min_row else 2
       out_c = 0 if c==min_col else 4
       output_grid[out_r,out_c] = 3

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
