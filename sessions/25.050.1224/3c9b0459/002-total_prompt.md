Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [3, 3]
  objects:
    red_regions:
      - positions: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [2, 0]]
      - shape: "irregular"
    blue_regions:
      - positions: [[0, 2], [1, 1], [2, 2]]
    azure_regions:
      - positions: [[2, 1]]
output_grid:
  dimensions: [3, 3]
  objects:
     blue_regions:
      - positions: [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2,0]]
     azure_regions:
      - positions: [[0, 1]]
     red_regions:
      - positions: [[0, 2], [1, 0], [1,2], [2,1], [2,2]]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Initial Objects:** In the input grid, we have three distinct colored regions: red (2), blue (1), and azure (8).

2.  **The colors flip:**.
    -   All the red cells become blue.
    -   All azure cells turn to blue
    -   All the blue cells turn red, except blue cell (1,1) that remains the same.
    -   One of the new blue cells turns to azure.

**In summary:**

The transformation inverts the colors of some objects in the grid: blue becomes red, red turns blue, and azure also turns to blue. The grid remains with constant dimensions.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
