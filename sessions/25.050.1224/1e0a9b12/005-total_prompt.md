Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**Observations:**

Input Grid:

-   Dimensions: 4x4
-   Colors present: 0 (white), 1 (blue), 4 (yellow), 6 (magenta), 9 (maroon)
-   Objects:
    -   A single blue cell (1) at (3, 0).
    -   Two single yellow cells (4) at (0, 1) and (2, 1).
    -   A single magenta cell (6) at (2,2).
    -    A single maroon cell (9) at (0,3)

Output Grid:

-   Dimensions: 4x4
-   Colors present: 0 (white), 1 (blue), 4 (yellow), 6 (magenta), 9 (maroon)
-   Objects:
    -   A single blue cell (1) at (3, 0).
    -    A single yellow cell (4) at (3,1)
    -   A single magenta cell (6) at (3, 2).
    -   A single maroon cell (9) at (3, 3).

**Transformation Rule (Natural Language Program):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all non-white cells in the input grid. These are our objects.

2.  **Move Down:** Shift the identified colored cells to the last row of the grid.

3. **Preserve X, Sort by X** The colored cells preserve the column, that is their horizontal (X) position.

4. **Fill with White** Fill the cells that the objects leaved with white.

In summary: The colored cells are moved to the last row of the output, the other cells are filled with white.


```python
"""
The colored cells are moved to the last row of the output, the other cells are filled with white.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by moving all non-white cells to the last row,
    preserving their original column order, and filling the remaining cells with white.
    """
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Find non-white cells and store their color and column
    non_white_cells = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if input_grid[r, c] != 0:
                non_white_cells.append((input_grid[r, c], c))

    # Place the non-white cells in the last row
    for i, (color, col) in enumerate(non_white_cells):
        output_grid[rows - 1, col] = color

    return output_grid
```


**input**
```
0 0 0 0 0 9
0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 0
4 0 7 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x79CABB63B6A0>

**output**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x79CABB63BA60>
Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**Observations:**

Input Grid:

-   Dimensions: 6x6
-   Colors: 0 (white), 4 (yellow), 7 (orange), 8 (azure), 9 (maroon)
-   Objects:
    -   Three yellow cells (4) forming a vertical line at column 0, rows 3, 4, and 5.
    -   Two orange cells (7) at (4, 2) and (5, 2).
    -   Two azure cells (8) at (1,3) and (4,3)
    -    One maroon cell at (0,5)

Output Grid:

-   Dimensions: 6x6
-    Colors: 0 (white), 4 (yellow), 7 (orange), 8 (azure), 9 (maroon)
-   Objects:
        -   Three yellow cells (4) forming a vertical line at column 0, rows 3, 4, and 5.
    -   Two orange cells (7) at (4, 2) and (5, 2).
    -    Two azure cells (8) at (5,3)
    -    One maroon cell at (5,5)

**Transformation Rule (Natural Language Program):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all non-white cells in the input grid.

2.  **Move Down:** Move all identified colored cells to the lowest available row within their respective columns. If multiple objects exist in the same column, stack them from bottom to top in the order they appeared in the input (top to bottom).

3. **Fill with White** Fill with white the cells left by the objects

In summary: This transformation moves each non-white cell down to the lowest available position in its column, effectively "dropping" the colored cells to the bottom, and filling the other positions with white.

The code written for the first example work as is for this second example.

```python
"""
The colored cells are moved to the last row of the output, the other cells are filled with white.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by moving all non-white cells to the last row,
    preserving their original column order, and filling the remaining cells with white.
    """
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Find non-white cells and store their color and column
    non_white_cells = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if input_grid[r, c] != 0:
                non_white_cells.append((input_grid[r, c], c))

    # Place the non-white cells in the last row
    for i, (color, col) in enumerate(non_white_cells):
        output_grid[rows - 1, col] = color

    return output_grid
```

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
