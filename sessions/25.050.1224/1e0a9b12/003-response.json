If multiple objects exist in the same column, stack them from bottom to top in the order they appeared in the input (top to bottom).\n\n3. **Fill with White** Fill with white the cells left by the objects\n\nIn summary: This transformation moves each non-white cell down to the lowest available position in its column, effectively \"dropping\" the colored cells to the bottom, and filling the other positions with white.\n\nThe code written for the first example work as is for this second example.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe colored cells are moved to the last row of the output, the other cells are filled with white.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by moving all non-white cells to the last row,\n    preserving their original column order, and filling the remaining cells with white.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Find non-white cells and store their color and column\n    non_white_cells = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] != 0:\n                non_white_cells.append((input_grid[r, c], c))\n\n    # Place the non-white cells in the last row\n    for i, (color, col) in enumerate(non_white_cells):\n        output_grid[rows - 1, col] = color\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
