These are our objects.\n\n2.  **Move Down:** Shift the identified colored cells to the last row of the grid.\n\n3. **Preserve X, Sort by X** The colored cells preserve the column, that is their horizontal (X) position.\n\n4. **Fill with White** Fill the cells that the objects leaved with white.\n\nIn summary: The colored cells are moved to the last row of the output, the other cells are filled with white.\n\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe colored cells are moved to the last row of the output, the other cells are filled with white.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by moving all non-white cells to the last row,\n    preserving their original column order, and filling the remaining cells with white.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Find non-white cells and store their color and column\n    non_white_cells = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] != 0:\n                non_white_cells.append((input_grid[r, c], c))\n\n    # Place the non-white cells in the last row\n    for i, (color, col) in enumerate(non_white_cells):\n        output_grid[rows - 1, col] = color\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
