Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml

output_grid:
    size: [3, 3]
    objects:

          shape: "single cell"
          position: [0, 0]
        - color: 7

          shape: "single cell"
          position: [1, 1]
        - color: 4
          shape: "single cell"
          position: [1, 2]
        - color: 4
          shape: "single cell"
          position: [2, 0]
        - color: 0
          shape: "single cell"
          position: [2, 1]
        - color: 0
          shape: "single cell"
          position: [2, 2]

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Target Cells:** The transformation extracts specific cells from the input grid to form the output grid. The program focuses on extracting a 3x3 subgrid defined by specific row and columns of the original grid.

2.  **Row and Column Selection:** The output grid comprises cells taken from rows 0, 1 and 2, and the columns selected are 6, 7 and 8 of the input grid.

3. **Output Formation**: The output grid is obtained by arranging the selected cells from the input grid.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation extracts a 3x3 subgrid from the top right corner of the input grid (rows 0, 1 and 2, and columns 6, 7, and 8) to create the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
