Otherwise, output blue. This rule worked for the first example, but it's clearly not the complete rule, as evidenced by failures in subsequent examples. We need to carefully examine the input-output pairs where the code failed to understand what additional conditions or alternative rules are at play. The current strategy assumes a 1x1 output, which must also be validated.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze Failed Examples:** Carefully compare the input and output grids of the failing examples. Look for patterns that the current rule misses. Are there specific shapes, arrangements, or colors that trigger different behaviors?\n2.  **Hypothesize Alternative Rules:** Based on the analysis of failed examples, formulate alternative or additional rules that could explain the observed transformations.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to incorporate the new rules, making it more comprehensive and accurate.\n4. **Prioritize context**: It's important to understand the goal and context of the transformation as well as the individual steps.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere, I will list the results of execution and use the interface to generate additional observation to establish a comprehensive understanding.\n\n```tool_code\nprint(f'{task.train=}')\nfor i, example in enumerate(task.train):\n    input_grid = example[\"input\"]\n    output_grid = example[\"output\"]\n    predicted_output = transform(input_grid)\n    print(f'{i=}')\n    print(f'{input_grid=}')\n    print(f'{output_grid=}')\n    print(f'{predicted_output=}')\n    print(f'{predicted_output == output_grid=}')\n\n```"
