The output is a single-digit integer, also potentially representing a color, within a 1x1 grid. The core task seems to involve summarizing or reducing the entire input grid into a single value. The specific colors (represented by the numbers) in the input grid seem crucial.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If non-zero values are not identical skip to the next step.\n3. **Non-Homogenous Non-zero values:** If the non-zero cells contain different values, perform another operation.
