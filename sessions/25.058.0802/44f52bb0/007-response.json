The dominant colors are white (0) and red (2).\n*   **Output:** A single numerical value (7), displayed within what appears to be a 1x1 grid filled with orange.\n*   The input grid seems to contain a pattern: red (2) pixels are along a diagonal and the first column.\n*    The output is not in the input, so must be computed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It must computed by counting the number of pixels. Orange is color 7, so a simple count would not be a good program. But since there are 3 red pixels, and 3 + 4 = 7, it might be that the color is computed using addition.\n"
