## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 0 2
0 2 0
2 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF73EB5DB0>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x71BF73D1E8F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing two colors: red (represented by the number 2) and white (represented by the number 0). The output is a 1x1 grid containing a single blue pixel (represented by the number 1). The transformation seems to involve a change in both the grid's dimensions and the colors present. It is focusing on counting red (2) objects.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions:
      input: 3x3
      output: 1x1
    elements:
      input: [red, white]
      output: [blue]
  - type: pixel
    color:
      input_red: 2
      input_white: 0
      output_blue: 1
    count:
      red: 4
      white: 5
      blue: 1

actions:
  - type: count
    target: red pixels
    result: 4
  - type: transform
    description: convert grid and colors to output
  - type: create
    description: create single pixel grid from red pixel count

relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: input grid
    to: red pixels
  - type: contains
    from: input grid
    to: white pixels
  - type: becomes
    from:  count of red
    to: output grid with blue color
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of red pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Create Output:** Create a 1x1 output grid.
3. **Fill color**: fill the grid with the color blue.
4. **Set value**: Set the value of the output pixel to the value of the count found in step 1.

Essentially, the transformation counts the red pixels in the input grid and represents that count as a single blue pixel in a 1x1 grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
