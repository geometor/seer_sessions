The output is a single numerical value (7). The colors in the visual representation correspond to the numerical values in the grid (0 is white, 2 is red). The output's visual representation seems to fill the whole space with a single color (orange, corresponding to 7).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

There are 9 total pixels\n*    `3 + 0 * (9)` is not equal to the output of `7`\n\nLet's reconsider the background value:\n\n1.  **Count:** Count the number of red pixels (value '2') in the input grid.\n2.  **Background value:** Perhaps, a better concept is that of \"other\": the background is the part of the grid *other* than the identified object, in this instance the \"red pixels\". The value for other is the sum of all the pixels, of a color *other* than that of the idenfitied object.\n3.  **Transform** The count of red pixels (3) is added to the background value *other*. The value is derived from a constant value x * number of pixels. *other* pixels have value of 0, and number is 6.\n4. `value = 3 + x * 6`. `value = 7` where x, the multipler for the \"other\" pixels = (7 - 3)/6 = 4 / 6, or 2/3. This is not an integer, so not consistent.\n\nAlternative strategy:\n1. **Count:** Count the number of red pixels.\n2. **Background value:** The value of \"other\" is the constant added to the pixel count to reach the output value.\n3. The other value is `7-3 = 4`. The question is what determines `4`. In this case, 4 is a count of specific *other* pixels, in this instance, the 4 white pixels in the 4 corners of the grid.\n\nFinal strategy:\n\n1.  **Count Red:** Count the number of red pixels (value '2') in the input grid.\n2.  **Count corners** Count the number of white pixels (value = 0) that are in the corners.\n3.  **Transform:** Add those two counts.\n4.  **Output:** The result is the final output value.\n"
