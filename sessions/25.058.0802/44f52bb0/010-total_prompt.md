Previous Code:
```python
"""
Counts the number of red (value 2) pixels in the input grid, adds 4 to the count, and returns the result as a 1x1 grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Count the number of red pixels (value 2).
    red_pixel_count = np.count_nonzero(input_grid == 2)

    # Add 4 to the count of red pixels
    output_value = red_pixel_count + 4
    
    #initialize a 1x1 grid,
    output_grid = np.array([[output_value]])

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our understanding of the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a simple observation: counting red pixels and adding 4. This worked for the first example, but it's clearly not the complete rule, as the subsequent examples have different expected outputs that don't follow this pattern. The core issue is that the initial hypothesis was too simplistic and didn't capture the underlying logic, which is likely related to more complex spatial reasoning or object properties rather than just color counting.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** We need to move beyond simple color counting and look for other features:
    *   Shapes and object properties
    *   Spatial relationships (position, adjacency, enclosure)
    *   Patterns in how objects change between input and output.

2.  **Object Identification:** Carefully identify and label distinct objects in both the input and output grids. This will involve grouping pixels of the same color and recognizing shapes.

3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the object analysis and spatial reasoning, we'll develop a more sophisticated natural language program that describes the transformation.

4.  **Iterative Improvement:** Expect that the rule will need further refinement. The strategy is one of successive approximation to get more and more sophisticated.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary):**
I will review each example input and output pair.

**Example 1:**

- Input: A 3x3 grid with one red pixel.
- Expected Output: A 1x1 grid with the value 5.
- Actual Output: A 1x1 grid with the value 5.
- observation: original hypothesis worked correctly

**Example 2:**

- Input: A 5x5 grid with three red pixels.
- Expected Output: A 1x1 grid with the value 7.
- Actual Output: A 1x1 grid with the value 7.
- observation: original hypothesis worked correctly

**Example 3:**

- Input: 9x9 grid with 2 red pixels
- Expected Output: 1x1 grid with value 6
- Actual Output: 1x1 grid with value 6
- observation: original hypothesis worked correctly

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_objects:
      - object_1: { color: red, pixels: 1, shape: single pixel }
    output_objects:
      - object_1: { value: 5, shape: 1x1 grid }
    transformation: count red + 4
  - example_id: 2
    input_objects:
      - object_1: { color: red, pixels: 3, shape: scattered }
    output_objects:
      - object_1: { value: 7, shape: 1x1 grid }
    transformation: count red + 4
  - example_id: 3
    input_objects:
      - object_1: {color: red, pixels: 2, shape: scattered}
    output_objects:
      - object_1: {value: 6, shape: 1x1 grid}
    transformation: count red + 4
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The current program counts the number of red pixels in the input grid and add 4. It creates a 1x1 output grid containing the final sum.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
