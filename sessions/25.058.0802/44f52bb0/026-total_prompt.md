## Example 5

**input:**
```
2 2 0
0 2 2
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF740D6CB0>

**output:**
```
7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x71BF73D1FBB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example pair, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The output is a single-digit integer, also potentially representing a color, within a 1x1 grid. The core task seems to involve summarizing or reducing the entire input grid into a single value. The specific colors (represented by the numbers) in the input grid seem crucial.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: InputGrid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - color_representation: true
  - name: OutputGrid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 1x1
      - values: integer
      - color_representation: true

actions:
  - name: Summarize
    input: InputGrid
    output: OutputGrid
    description: Reduces the input grid to a single value based on a defined rule

relationships:
 - subject: InputGrid
   predicate: is reduced to
   object: OutputGrid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify non-zero values:** Examine the InputGrid and identify all cells that do not contain the value 0 (white).
2. **Check for homogeneity:** If all non-zero cells in the InputGrid have the *same* non-zero value, proceed to the next step. If non-zero values are not identical skip to the next step.
3. **Non-Homogenous Non-zero values:** If the non-zero cells contain different values, perform another operation. If all values are equal, output the next color in the sequence.
4. **Assign output:** If the conditions are met, assign the next color in the sequence.
   Sequence: `0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 5: gray, 6: magenta, 7: orange, 8: azure, 9: maroon`
   - The output color is 7 (orange).

In this example, input has values 0 and 2. Value 2 (red) is non-zero and repeated. The color after red in the defined sequence wraps around to orange.

The most likely output grid color code is always the next value in the sequence.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
