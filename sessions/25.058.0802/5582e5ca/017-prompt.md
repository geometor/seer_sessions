"""
1.  **Check for Identity:** If the input grid has a checkerboard or repeating color, then the output grid is identical to the input grid.
2.  Check for adjacent pixels in multiple rows: Find if there is a color that fills three adjacent rows. If there is, fill the output with the color.
3. **Otherwise, find adjacent and fill.** Scan the input grid to identify a color value that appears in at least two positions that are either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
4. **Create output**: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid. Fill all cells in the output grid with this identified "target" color.
5. **If not found:** If no such color is found in steps 2 and 3, return the input grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
