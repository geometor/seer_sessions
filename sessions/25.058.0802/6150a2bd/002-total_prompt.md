## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF740D65D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF740D6CB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The transformation appears to involve a rotation of the grid's contents. The colors (represented by numbers) themselves seem unchanged; it's their positions within the grid that are altered.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color: mapped from integer value

actions:
  - type: rotation
    description: Contents of the grid are rotated.

relationships:
  - input_grid: elements are spatially rearranged to form output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid. The values, which correspond to colors per a color map, don't change, only their position in the grid changes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
