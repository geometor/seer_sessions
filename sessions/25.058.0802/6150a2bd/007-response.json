Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9), corresponding to a specific color. The transformation seems to involve a 90-degree clockwise rotation and possibly some color changes, but more examples would be useful to establish the exact relationship. The layout of numbers appears mirrored.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
