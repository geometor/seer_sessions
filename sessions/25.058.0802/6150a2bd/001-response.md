Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The transformation appears to involve a rotation of the grid's contents. The colors (represented by numbers) themselves seem unchanged; it's their positions within the grid that are altered.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color: mapped from integer value

actions:
  - type: rotation
    description: Contents of the grid are rotated.

relationships:
  - input_grid: elements are spatially rearranged to form output_grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid. The values, which correspond to colors per a color map, don't change, only their position in the grid changes.
