Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows: Each cell in the input grid is incremented by one. If the incremented value is equal to 10, the value is changed to 0. The output grid has the same dimensions and spatial arrangement as the input grid. The transformation is purely element-wise and does not involve any spatial reasoning or object interaction beyond corresponding cell locations.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by adding 1 to each cell value, wrapping around to 0 if the result is 10.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.  Using numpy for easier manipulation.
    output_grid = np.array(input_grid).copy()

    # Iterate through each cell of the output grid and add 1 to its value.
    for row_index in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for col_index in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            output_grid[row_index, col_index] = (output_grid[row_index, col_index] + 1) % 10

    return output_grid.tolist() # return as list
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
