Each integer in the input grid corresponds to a specific color, and the output grid maintains the same dimensions but with different integer values, also representing colors. The transformation appears to be a simple, consistent numerical mapping applied to each cell independently. There are no apparent spatial or object-based interactions; the transformation is purely based on the initial value of each cell.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
