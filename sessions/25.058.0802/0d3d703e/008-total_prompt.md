## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 3 8
2 3 8
2 3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF740D6CB0>

**output:**
```
6 4 9
6 4 9
6 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF73EB5950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel in the input grid has a corresponding pixel in the output grid at the same position. The transformation seems to be a simple color mapping, meaning each input color is consistently replaced by a specific output color. The spatial arrangement (3x3 grid) remains constant.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: mapped
    relationships:
      - spatial: "input pixel (x, y) corresponds to output pixel (x, y)"
    transformations:
      - type: color_mapping
        mapping:
          red (2): magenta (6)
          green (3): yellow (4)
          azure (8): maroon (9)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of pixels, where each pixel has one of the following colors: red (2), green (3), or azure (8).
2.  **Transformation:** For each pixel in the input grid, replace its color according to the following mapping:
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6)
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4)
    *   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9)
3.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid with the new colors, preserving the original spatial arrangement. The size of the output is identical with the input.

Essentially this a direct color substitution.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
