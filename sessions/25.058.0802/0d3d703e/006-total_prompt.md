Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows: Each cell in the input grid is incremented by one. If the incremented value is equal to 10, the value is changed to 0. The output grid has the same dimensions and spatial arrangement as the input grid. The transformation is purely element-wise and does not involve any spatial reasoning or object interaction beyond corresponding cell locations.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by adding 1 to each cell value, wrapping around to 0 if the result is 10.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.  Using numpy for easier manipulation.
    output_grid = np.array(input_grid).copy()

    # Iterate through each cell of the output grid and add 1 to its value.
    for row_index in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for col_index in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            output_grid[row_index, col_index] = (output_grid[row_index, col_index] + 1) % 10

    return output_grid.tolist() # return as list
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a simple rule: increment each cell value by one, wrapping around to 0 if the value reaches 10. The provided code implements this rule correctly. The testing results show it succeeds. Therefore, the focus of this iteration is to simply improve clarity, documentation and format of presentation of the results to be passed to the next `coder` prompt.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of the training set results, re-stated here for clarity and making any necessary corrections:

*   **Training Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[[5, 6], [7, 8]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[6, 7], [8, 9]]`
    *   Actual Output: `[[6, 7], [8, 9]]`
    *   Result: **Success**

*   **Training Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[[9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Actual Output: `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Result: **Success**

*   **Training Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[[4, 4, 5, 5], [4, 4, 5, 5], [6, 6, 7, 7], [6, 6, 7, 7]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 5, 6, 6], [5, 5, 6, 6], [7, 7, 8, 8], [7, 7, 8, 8]]`
    *   Actual Output: `[[5, 5, 6, 6], [5, 5, 6, 6], [7, 7, 8, 8], [7, 7, 8, 8]]`
    *   Result: **Success**

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
observations:
  - description: |
      The transformation operates on individual cells of the input grid.
      Each cell's value is incremented by one.
      If the incremented value is 10, it wraps around to 0.
    objects:
      - name: input_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - contains: integers (0-9)
      - name: output_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - contains: integers (0-9)
          - dimensions: same as input_grid
    actions:
      - name: increment
        agent: system
        target: each cell value in input_grid
        operation: add 1
        constraints:
          - "if result is 10, set to 0"
    success_criteria: All training examples pass.
```

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Cellular Increment:** For each cell in the input grid, increase its value by 1.
2.  **Modulo 10:** If the incremented value equals 10, replace it with 0. Otherwise, keep the incremented value.
3. **Grid Dimensions**: The output has the same dimensions as the input
4. **Spatial Correspondence**: Each cell in the output grid corresponds directly with same cell in the input grid

This can be stated more concisely: Increment each cell value in the input grid by 1, modulo 10. The output grid has the same shape as the input, preserving the spatial arrangement.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
