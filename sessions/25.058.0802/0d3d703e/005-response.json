            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a simple rule: increment each cell value by one, wrapping around to 0 if the value reaches 10. The provided code implements this rule correctly. The testing results show it succeeds. Therefore, the focus of this iteration is to simply improve clarity, documentation and format of presentation of the results to be passed to the next `coder` prompt.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the training set results, re-stated here for clarity and making any necessary corrections:\n\n*   **Training Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[5, 6], [7, 8]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[6, 7], [8, 9]]`\n    *   Actual Output: `[[6, 7], [8, 9]]`\n    *   Result: **Success**\n\n*   **Training Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[[9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Actual Output: `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Result: **Success**\n\n*   **Training Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[[4, 4, 5, 5], [4, 4, 5, 5], [6, 6, 7, 7], [6, 6, 7, 7]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 5, 6, 6], [5, 5, 6, 6], [7, 7, 8, 8], [7, 7, 8, 8]]`\n    *   Actual Output: `[[5, 5, 6, 6], [5, 5, 6, 6], [7, 7, 8, 8], [7, 7, 8, 8]]`\n    *   Result: **Success**\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - description: |\n      The transformation operates on individual cells of the input grid.\n      Each cell's value is incremented by one.\n      If the incremented value is 10, it wraps around to 0.\n    objects:\n      - name: input_grid\n        type: 2D array\n        properties:\n          - contains: integers (0-9)\n      - name: output_grid\n        type: 2D array\n        properties:\n          - contains: integers (0-9)\n          - dimensions: same as input_grid\n    actions:\n      - name: increment\n        agent: system\n        target: each cell value in input_grid\n        operation: add 1\n        constraints:\n          - \"if result is 10, set to 0\"\n    success_criteria: All training examples pass.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nThe transformation rule can be described as follows:\n\n1.  **Cellular Increment:** For each cell in the input grid, increase its value by 1.\n2.  **Modulo 10:** If the incremented value equals 10, replace it with 0. Otherwise, keep the incremented value.\n3. **Grid Dimensions**: The output has the same dimensions as the input\n4. **Spatial Correspondence**: Each cell in the output grid corresponds directly with same cell in the input grid\n\nThis can be stated more concisely: Increment each cell value in the input grid by 1, modulo 10. The output grid has the same shape as the input, preserving the spatial arrangement.\n"
