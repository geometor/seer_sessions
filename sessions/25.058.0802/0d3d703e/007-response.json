Each pixel in the input grid has a corresponding pixel in the output grid at the same position. The transformation seems to be a simple color mapping, meaning each input color is consistently replaced by a specific output color. The spatial arrangement (3x3 grid) remains constant.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
