  - description: |
      The transformation operates on individual cells of the input grid.
      Each cell's value is incremented by one.
      If the incremented value is 10, it wraps around to 0.
    objects:
      - name: input_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - contains: integers (0-9)
      - name: output_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - contains: integers (0-9)
          - dimensions: same as input_grid
    actions:
      - name: increment
        agent: system
        target: each cell value in input_grid
        operation: add 1
        constraints:
          - "if result is 10, set to 0"
    success_criteria: All training examples pass.
