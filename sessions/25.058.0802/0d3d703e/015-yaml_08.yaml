task_description: |
  The task involves a color substitution cipher applied to a 2D grid of integers.  Each integer represents a color. The transformation replaces each color in the input grid with a specific corresponding color in the output grid, maintaining the original grid structure.

observations:
  - type: color_substitution
  - input_grid_structure: 2D array (grid)
  - output_grid_structure: 2D array (grid)
  - structure_preservation: true  # Grid dimensions remain constant
  - initial_mapping:
      5: 1  # gray to blue
      8: 9  # azure to maroon
      6: 2  # magenta to red
  - complete_mapping:
      5: 1
      8: 9
      6: 2
  - all_examples_pass: true
