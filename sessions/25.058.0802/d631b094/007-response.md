Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid containing the values 0 and 2.  0 represents white, and 2 represents red.
*   **Output:** A 1x3 grid containing only the value 2 (red).
*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve extracting all '2' (red) values from the input grid and consolidating them into a single row. The white pixels are discarded. The height of the output seems related somehow to presence of red pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [white, red]
      values: [[0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0]]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 1x3
      colors: [red]
      values: [[2, 2, 2]]
  - action: extract_color
    input: input_grid
    parameters:
        color: 2
    output: a list of color
  - action: create_row
    input: extracted color list
    output: output_grid

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels with the value '2' (red) in the input grid.
2.  **Extract** and Collect those pixels.
3.  Create new grid one row high and the number of columns is the count of pixels.
4. **Discard** all other pixels
