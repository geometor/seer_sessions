## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0
1 0 0
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF73D1ED50>

**output:**
```
1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x64 at 0x71BF73D1FD90>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 3x3 grid.
*   The output is a 1x2 grid.
*   The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue).
*   The output grid contains only 1s (blue).
*   The number of 1s in the input grid seems to correspond to the number of cells in the output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
    colors:
        0: white
        1: blue

  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 1x2
    elements: [1, 1]
    colors:
        1: blue

relationships:
  - type: correspondence
    description: "Number of blue cells in input_grid equals number of cells in output_grid"

actions:
  - type: count
    object: input_grid
    property: blue cells
  - type: create
    object: output_grid
    property: dimensions based on count
    value: blue
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of blue (value 1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Create:** Create a new grid.
3. **Determine Dimensions:** The output is a 1 x N grid, where N is the number counted in step 1.
4. **Fill:** Fill all cells of the new grid with blue (value 1).

In essence, the transformation extracts the blue pixels from the input and creates a new grid where the number of cells equals the original number of blue cells, and sets their value to blue.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
