Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid. Most cells are white (0), but there's a single orange (7) cell in the top-middle position. The output is a 1x1 grid containing only the orange (7) cell. The task appears to involve extracting a specific, non-white cell from the input grid. The background is white, making the colored pixels more prominent.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
        count: 8
      - color: orange
        value: 7
        count: 1
        position: [0,1] #row, col
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x1
    elements:
      - color: orange
        value: 7
        count: 1
  - transformation: extraction
  - rule: "extract the non-zero cell"

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input grid.
2.  Locate the single cell that has color orange, which means a pixel value that is not 0.
3.  Create a 1x1 output grid.
4.  Place the value of the non-white cell into the output grid.
