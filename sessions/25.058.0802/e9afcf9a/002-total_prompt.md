## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x128 at 0x71BF73EB5DB0>

**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x128 at 0x71BF73EB5950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids are composed of single-digit integers, representing colors. The input grid consists of two horizontal lines of equal length. The first line is entirely composed of the digit '3' (green), and the second line is entirely composed of the digit '9' (maroon). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, but the values alternate between '3' and '9' in a checkerboard pattern.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 2x6
    rows:
      - [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
      - [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 2x6
    rows:
      - [3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9]
      - [9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3]
  - observation: |
      The output grid retains the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - observation: |
      The values in the output grid alternate between the two values present in the input grid (3 and 9).
  - observation: |
     The alternation creates a checkerboard pattern
  - observation: the first row starts with 3, the second row starts with 9

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.

2.  **Alternating Pattern:** Fill the output grid by alternating between the values found in the first and second rows of the input grid.
    *   For the first row of the output, start with the value from the first row of the input, and alternate.
    *   For the second row of the output, start with the value from the second row of the input and alternate.
    *   Continue for any further rows in the same alternating starting pattern as established by the first two rows

3. **Output:** return the new grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
