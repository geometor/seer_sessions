## Example 3

**input:**
```
4 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF73EB5DB0>

**output:**
```
4 0 0
4 2 0
4 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF7B8B4CD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids are 3x3.  The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors present are yellow (4), red (2), and white (0). The transformation seems to involve a change in the arrangement and potentially duplication of these colored pixels. The output image is simple a replication of the first two rows into the third row.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        values: [0, 2, 4]
    properties:
        - colors: [white, red, yellow]

transformations:
    - type: copy paste of rows
    - description: some of the pixels have had rows copied

relationships:
  - input grid maps to output grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the first row and second row of the input grid.
2.  **Copy** first row to third row of output grid.
3.  **Copy** second row to third row of output grid.

In essence, the transformation replicates the yellow and the combined yellow/red pixels from the input, positioning this new arrangement and shape into a specific location in the output grid, to fill down vertically.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
