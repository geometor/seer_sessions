facts:
  - observation: |
      Each input grid is transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions.
  - object_identification: |
      The primary objects are the entire grids and the individual pixels within them.
      Pixels are characterized by their color.
  - transformation_rule: |
     The output grid is a copy of the input grid.  All the non-white colors in the input grid are
     replaced by a single color in the output grid.
  - color_consistency: |
      The replacement color is consistent within each output grid, but varies between different examples.
      The replacement colors across examples are blue, green, and yellow.
  - background_color:
      White pixels (color 0) remain unchanged in all examples.
