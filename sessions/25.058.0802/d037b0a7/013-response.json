The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors present are yellow (4), red (2), and white (0). The transformation seems to involve a change in the arrangement and potentially duplication of these colored pixels. The output image is simple a replication of the first two rows into the third row.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
