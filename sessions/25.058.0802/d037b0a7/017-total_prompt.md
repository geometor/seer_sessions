Previous Code:
```python
"""
Copy the second row of the input grid to the third row of the output grid.
The first and second rows of the output grid are different than those of the input grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.  This is a good practice,
    # even if we end up overwriting all the rows later.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Get the number of rows in the input grid
    num_rows = input_grid.shape[0]

    # Check if the input grid has at least 2 rows
    if num_rows >= 2:
        # Copy the second row to the third row, if the output grid has a third row.
        if num_rows >= 3:
          output_grid[2, :] = input_grid[1, :]
        
        # make all the rows the second row
        output_grid[0, :] = input_grid[1, :]
        output_grid[1, :] = input_grid[1, :]


    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
