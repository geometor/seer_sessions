*   **Perception**:
    *   The input grids contain exactly two non-white pixels, always located on the same row. All other pixels are white (0).
    *   The output grids modify only the row containing the two non-white pixels.
    *   The transformation fills the gap between the two initial non-white pixels on that row.
    *   The filling uses the color of the left pixel for the left part of the gap and the color of the right pixel for the right part of the gap.
    *   A single gray pixel (5) is placed exactly in the middle column between the original two pixels.
    *   The original two non-white pixels remain in their positions in the output.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_transformation
    grid_properties:
      - dimensionality: 2D
      - color_palette: 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, orange, gray)
    objects:
      - type: pixel
        count_input: 2 (non-white)
        properties:
          - color: varies (green/orange in ex1, blue/red in ex2)
          - position: located on the same horizontal row, separated by white pixels
    actions:
      - identify: find the row containing the two non-white pixels
      - identify: get the column indices (col1, col2) and colors (color1, color2) of the two pixels
      - calculate: find the midpoint column index: mid_col = (col1 + col2) // 2
      - fill: horizontally between the two pixels
        - rule_left: fill cells from col1 + 1 to mid_col - 1 with color1
        - rule_mid: place gray (5) at mid_col
        - rule_right: fill cells from mid_col + 1 to col2 - 1 with color2
    relationships:
      - spatial: the two non-white pixels are horizontally aligned
      - transformation: the space between the pixels is filled based on their colors and positions, with a gray marker at the center.
    constants:
      - color_gray: 5 (used as a midpoint marker)
    invariants:
      - grid_dimensions: remain unchanged
      - background_color: white (0) pixels not on the affected row remain white
      - original_pixels: the two initial non-white pixels remain in their positions
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Find the row in the input grid that contains exactly two non-white pixels. Let this row index be `R`.
    2.  Identify the column indices `C1` and `C2` (where `C1 < C2`) and the colors `Color1` and `Color2` of these two pixels at `(R, C1)` and `(R, C2)` respectively.
    3.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    4.  Calculate the midpoint column index `MidC = (C1 + C2) // 2`.
    5.  Iterate through the columns from `C1 + 1` to `MidC - 1`. For each column `c` in this range, set the pixel at `(R, c)` in the output grid to `Color1`.
    6.  Set the pixel at `(R, MidC)` in the output grid to gray (color 5).
    7.  Iterate through the columns from `MidC + 1` to `C2 - 1`. For each column `c` in this range, set the pixel at `(R, c)` in the output grid to `Color2`.
    8.  Return the modified output grid.
