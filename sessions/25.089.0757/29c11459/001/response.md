"""
Find the row in the input grid that contains exactly two non-white pixels.
Identify the column indices (C1 < C2) and colors (Color1, Color2) of these pixels.
Create a copy of the input grid.
Calculate the midpoint column index MidC = (C1 + C2) // 2.
Fill the pixels between C1 and MidC (exclusive) with Color1.
Set the pixel at MidC to gray (5).
Fill the pixels between MidC and C2 (exclusive) with Color2.
Return the modified grid.
