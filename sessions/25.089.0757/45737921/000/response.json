For example, if an object is made of color A and color B, all pixels of color A become color B, and all pixels of color B become color A in the output.\n*   Objects that are spatially separated are treated independently.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Adjacency includes diagonals.\n  - count_persistence: The number of objects in the input matches the number of objects in the output.\n  - location_persistence: The bounding box or general location of each object remains the same.\n  - shape_persistence: The overall shape formed by the combined pixels of an object remains the same.\n  - color_composition: Each object consists of exactly two distinct non-white colors (let's call them color C1 and color C2).\n\nactions:\n  - name: color_swap\n  - description: Within each identified object, replace all occurrences of color C1 with color C2, and all occurrences of color C2 with color C1.\n  - scope: Applied independently to each object.\n\nrelationships:\n  - Objects are distinct entities based on connectivity and color composition.\n  - The transformation rule applies uniformly to all objects meeting the criteria.\n```"
