task_description: Swap the two constituent colors within each distinct multi-colored object, leaving the background unchanged.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - background_persistence: The background color and its positions remain unchanged between input and output.
  - dimensions_persistence: Input and output grids have the same height and width.

objects:
  - definition: A contiguous group of non-background pixels composed of exactly two distinct colors. Adjacency includes diagonals.
  - count_persistence: The number of objects in the input matches the number of objects in the output.
  - location_persistence: The bounding box or general location of each object remains the same.
  - shape_persistence: The overall shape formed by the combined pixels of an object remains the same.
  - color_composition: Each object consists of exactly two distinct non-white colors (let's call them color C1 and color C2).

actions:
  - name: color_swap
  - description: Within each identified object, replace all occurrences of color C1 with color C2, and all occurrences of color C2 with color C1.
  - scope: Applied independently to each object.

relationships:
  - Objects are distinct entities based on connectivity and color composition.
  - The transformation rule applies uniformly to all objects meeting the criteria.
