The input grid appears to be composed of three distinct 3x3 subgrids stacked vertically. The output grid is consistently one of these three subgrids. The task is to identify the correct subgrid from the input to produce the output.\n\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Decomposition:** The 9x3 input grid can be divided into three 3x3 subgrids: Top (rows 0-2), Middle (rows 3-5), and Bottom (rows 6-8).\n    2.  **Feature Calculation:** A key feature seems to be the sum of the pixel values (colors) within each 3x3 subgrid.\n    3.  **Selection Criteria:** The subgrid with the *maximum* sum of pixel values plays a crucial role in determining the output. Let's call this the \"MaxSumBlock\".\n    4.  **Secondary Feature:** The parity (oddness or evenness) of the unique colors present *within* the MaxSumBlock determines which subgrid (Top, Middle, or Bottom) becomes the final output.\n    5.  **Mapping Rule:**\n        *   Calculate the sums: Sum(Top), Sum(Middle), Sum(Bottom).\n        *   Identify the MaxSumBlock (the one with the highest sum).\n        *   Examine the unique colors within the MaxSumBlock. Count how many unique odd colors (NumOdd) and unique even colors (NumEven) are present.\n        *   Apply the following mapping based on the MaxSumBlock's position and the parity counts:\n            *   If MaxSumBlock is Top:\n                *   If only even unique colors exist (NumOdd=0, NumEven>=1): Output is Top subgrid. (Example 3)\n                *   If both odd and even unique colors exist (NumOdd>=1, NumEven>=1): Output is Bottom subgrid. (Example 4)\n            *   If MaxSumBlock is Middle:\n                *   If both odd and even unique colors exist (NumOdd>=1, NumEven>=1): Output is Middle subgrid. (Example 2)\n                *   If only odd unique colors exist (NumOdd>=1, NumEven=0): Output is Bottom subgrid. (Example 1)\n            *   If MaxSumBlock is Bottom: (No examples provided, but following a potential pattern, rules would be needed based on parity counts).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
