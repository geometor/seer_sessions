*   **Perception:** The input grid is always 9 rows by 3 columns. The output grid is always 3 rows by 3 columns. The input grid appears to be composed of three distinct 3x3 subgrids stacked vertically. The output grid is consistently one of these three subgrids. The task is to identify the correct subgrid from the input to produce the output.

*   **Analysis:**
    1.  **Decomposition:** The 9x3 input grid can be divided into three 3x3 subgrids: Top (rows 0-2), Middle (rows 3-5), and Bottom (rows 6-8).
    2.  **Feature Calculation:** A key feature seems to be the sum of the pixel values (colors) within each 3x3 subgrid.
    3.  **Selection Criteria:** The subgrid with the *maximum* sum of pixel values plays a crucial role in determining the output. Let's call this the "MaxSumBlock".
    4.  **Secondary Feature:** The parity (oddness or evenness) of the unique colors present *within* the MaxSumBlock determines which subgrid (Top, Middle, or Bottom) becomes the final output.
    5.  **Mapping Rule:**
        *   Calculate the sums: Sum(Top), Sum(Middle), Sum(Bottom).
        *   Identify the MaxSumBlock (the one with the highest sum).
        *   Examine the unique colors within the MaxSumBlock. Count how many unique odd colors (NumOdd) and unique even colors (NumEven) are present.
        *   Apply the following mapping based on the MaxSumBlock's position and the parity counts:
            *   If MaxSumBlock is Top:
                *   If only even unique colors exist (NumOdd=0, NumEven>=1): Output is Top subgrid. (Example 3)
                *   If both odd and even unique colors exist (NumOdd>=1, NumEven>=1): Output is Bottom subgrid. (Example 4)
            *   If MaxSumBlock is Middle:
                *   If both odd and even unique colors exist (NumOdd>=1, NumEven>=1): Output is Middle subgrid. (Example 2)
                *   If only odd unique colors exist (NumOdd>=1, NumEven=0): Output is Bottom subgrid. (Example 1)
            *   If MaxSumBlock is Bottom: (No examples provided, but following a potential pattern, rules would be needed based on parity counts).

```yaml
    task_description: Select one of three vertical 3x3 subgrids from a 9x3 input grid based on pixel sum and color parity rules.
    
    input_grid:
      shape: [9, 3]
      structure: Composed of three stacked 3x3 subgrids (Top, Middle, Bottom).
      elements: Pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
    
    output_grid:
      shape: [3, 3]
      source: A direct copy of one of the three 3x3 subgrids from the input.
    
    transformation_steps:
      - step: 1
        action: Divide the input grid into three 3x3 subgrids.
        parameters:

            columns: [0, 1, 2]
      - step: 2
        action: Calculate the sum of pixel values for each subgrid.
        outputs: [Sum_Top, Sum_Middle, Sum_Bottom]
      - step: 3
        action: Identify the subgrid with the maximum sum.
        output: MaxSumBlock (can be Top, Middle, or Bottom)
      - step: 4
        action: Analyze the unique colors within the MaxSumBlock.
        outputs:
          - UniqueColors (set of color values)
          - NumOdd (count of unique odd colors)
          - NumEven (count of unique even colors, excluding 0 if applicable, though 0 not seen in key blocks here)
      - step: 5
        action: Select the output subgrid based on MaxSumBlock position and color parity counts.
        rules:
          - condition: MaxSumBlock is Top
            sub_rules:
              - condition: NumOdd == 0 and NumEven >= 1
                result: Select Top subgrid as output.
              - condition: NumOdd >= 1 and NumEven >= 1
                result: Select Bottom subgrid as output.
          - condition: MaxSumBlock is Middle
            sub_rules:
              - condition: NumOdd >= 1 and NumEven >= 1
                result: Select Middle subgrid as output.
              - condition: NumOdd >= 1 and NumEven == 0
                result: Select Bottom subgrid as output.
          - condition: MaxSumBlock is Bottom
            sub_rules: # Extrapolation needed if this case occurs
              - result: Select subgrid based on potentially symmetric or extended parity rules (e.g., Even-Only -> Bottom, Mixed -> Top, Odd-Only -> Middle - speculative).

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the 9x3 input grid.
    2.  Divide the input grid vertically into three equal 3x3 sections: the Top section (rows 0-2), the Middle section (rows 3-5), and the Bottom section (rows 6-8).
    3.  Calculate the sum of all pixel values within each of the three sections.
    4.  Determine which section (Top, Middle, or Bottom) has the largest sum. Call this the "Max Sum Section".
    5.  Examine the unique colors present in the Max Sum Section.
    6.  Count how many of these unique colors have odd values (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and how many have even values (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
    7.  Use the location of the Max Sum Section and the counts of odd/even unique colors to choose the final output section:
        *   If the Max Sum Section is the Top section:
            *   If it contains only unique even colors, the output is the Top section.
            *   If it contains a mix of unique odd and even colors, the output is the Bottom section.
        *   If the Max Sum Section is the Middle section:
            *   If it contains a mix of unique odd and even colors, the output is the Middle section.
            *   If it contains only unique odd colors, the output is the Bottom section.
        *   (Define rules for when the Max Sum Section is the Bottom section if needed, based on observed patterns or assumptions).
    8.  The chosen section becomes the 3x3 output grid.
