Select one of three vertical 3x3 subgrids from a 9x3 input grid.
The selection process involves:
1. Dividing the 9x3 input into Top, Middle, and Bottom 3x3 subgrids.
2. Calculating the sum of pixel values for each subgrid.
3. Identifying the subgrid with the maximum sum (MaxSumBlock). If sums are tied, the topmost block wins.
4. Analyzing the unique non-zero colors within the MaxSumBlock to count unique odd and even colors.
5. Applying rules based on the MaxSumBlock's position (Top, Middle, Bottom) and the color parity counts to determine the final output subgrid:
   - If MaxSumBlock is Top:
     - Only even unique colors -> Output is Top.
     - Mixed unique odd/even colors -> Output is Bottom.
   - If MaxSumBlock is Middle:
     - Only odd unique colors -> Output is Bottom.
   - If MaxSumBlock is Bottom:
     - Mixed unique odd/even colors -> Output is Middle.
