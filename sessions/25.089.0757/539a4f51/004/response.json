            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the transformation.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the output grid size (2x input dimensions) and the basic 2x2 quadrant structure. It also correctly handled the modification of the input grid (replacing white with the top-left color) and placing this modified grid (I') in the top-left (TL) and bottom-right (BR) quadrants.\n\nHowever, the code incorrectly assumed the top-right (TR) quadrant was also the modified grid (I') and the bottom-left (BL) quadrant was simply filled with the top-left color. The provided examples show that:\n\n1.  The **Top-Right (TR) quadrant** is constructed by taking the *first row* of the modified grid (I') and repeating it vertically for the height of the original input grid.\n2.  The **Bottom-Left (BL) quadrant** is constructed by taking the *first column* of the modified grid (I') and repeating it horizontally for the width of the original input grid (effectively, each row `i` in the BL quadrant is filled with the color `I'[i, 0]`).\n\nThe strategy is to update the natural language program and subsequent code to reflect these specific rules for generating the TR and BL quadrants based on the modified input grid (I').\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's use `tool_code` to verify dimensions and analyze the quadrant structures based on the new hypothesis.\n\n"
