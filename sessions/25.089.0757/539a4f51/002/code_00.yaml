Task: Tile and Modify Grid based on Top-Left Color

Input_Global:
  - Object: Input Grid
    Properties:
      - Arbitrary height (H) and width (W) between 1 and 30.
      - Contains pixels with colors 0-9.
      - May or may not contain the background color white (0).
      - Has a specific color at the top-left corner (0,0), designated as C.

Output_Global:
  - Object: Output Grid
    Properties:
      - Height is 2 * H.
      - Width is 2 * W.
      - Composed of four quadrants, each of size H x W.

Transformation_Steps:
  - 1. Determine the dimensions (H, W) of the Input Grid.
  - 2. Identify the color C at the top-left corner (0,0) of the Input Grid.
  - 3. Create a Modified Input Grid (I'):
      - Start with a copy of the Input Grid.
      - Check if the Input Grid contains any white (0) pixels.
      - If white pixels exist, replace all white (0) pixels in the copy with color C.
      - If no white pixels exist, the Modified Input Grid (I') is identical to the Input Grid.
  - 4. Create a Fill Grid:
      - Create a grid of size H x W.
      - Fill this grid entirely with color C.
  - 5. Construct the Output Grid (2H x 2W):
      - Place the Modified Input Grid (I') in the Top-Left quadrant (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
      - Place the Modified Input Grid (I') in the Top-Right quadrant (rows 0 to H-1, columns W to 2W-1).
      - Place the Fill Grid in the Bottom-Left quadrant (rows H to 2H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
      - Place the Modified Input Grid (I') in the Bottom-Right quadrant (rows H to 2H-1, columns W to 2W-1).

Relationships:
  - Output dimensions are double the input dimensions.
  - The content of three output quadrants (TL, TR, BR) depends on the Input Grid, potentially modified by replacing background color (0) with the top-left color (C).
  - The content of one output quadrant (BL) depends only on the top-left color (C) of the Input Grid.
