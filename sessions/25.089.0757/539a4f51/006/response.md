## General Assessment

The provided code successfully transforms the input grid for Example 3, where the input contains no white (0) pixels. However, it fails for Examples 1 and 2, both of which contain white pixels in the input.

The core logic involves creating a 2x2 arrangement of quadrants in the output grid, each quadrant having the same dimensions (H x W) as the input grid. The Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), and Bottom-Right (BR) quadrants appear to be generated correctly based on a "modified input grid" (I'). The modification involves replacing white pixels (0) with the top-left corner pixel's color (C) if white pixels exist in the input; otherwise, the modified grid is identical to the input.

The discrepancy arises in the Bottom-Left (BL) quadrant.
- The current code *always* generates the BL quadrant by tiling the *first column* of the modified grid (I') horizontally.
- Analysis of the failed examples (1 and 2) shows that when the original input *contains* white pixels, the expected BL quadrant is generated by tiling the *last row* of the modified grid (I') horizontally.
- In Example 3 (no white pixels), the expected BL quadrant *is* generated by tiling the *first column* of the (unmodified) input grid horizontally, which is consistent with the current code's behavior in that specific case.

Therefore, the strategy is to adjust the logic for generating the BL quadrant based on the presence of white pixels in the original input grid.

## Metrics

Let's analyze the inputs and outputs for the failed examples:

**Example 1:**
*   Input Grid (5x5): Contains white (0). Top-left color C = 1 (blue).
*   Modified Input Grid (I'): Input with 0 replaced by 1.
    
```
    [[1, 1, 4, 6, 1],
     [1, 1, 4, 6, 1],
     [4, 4, 4, 6, 1],
     [6, 6, 6, 6, 1],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
    ```

*   First Column of I': `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`
*   Last Row of I': `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
*   Expected Output BL Quadrant: Last row of I' tiled horizontally.
    
```
    [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
    ```

*   Transformed Output BL Quadrant (Current Code): First column of I' tiled horizontally.
    
```
    [[1, 1, 4, 6, 1],
     [1, 1, 4, 6, 1],
     [1, 1, 4, 6, 1],
     [1, 1, 4, 6, 1],
     [1, 1, 4, 6, 1]]
    ```

*   Error: BL quadrant mismatch. Pixels Off = 25 (size of the BL quadrant). *Correction:* The score indicates 45 pixels off. Let's recheck the transformed output from the prompt.
    *   Transformed Output (from prompt):
        
```
        1 1 4 6 1 | 1 1 4 6 1
        1 1 4 6 1 | 1 1 4 6 1
        4 4 4 6 1 | 1 1 4 6 1
        6 6 6 6 1 | 1 1 4 6 1
        1 1 1 1 1 | 1 1 4 6 1
        ----------+----------
        1 1 1 1 1 | 1 1 4 6 1  <- My analysis predicted this BL: [[1,1,4,6,1]...]
        1 1 1 1 1 | 1 1 4 6 1
        4 4 4 4 4 | 4 4 4 6 1  <- This BL row is different!
        6 6 6 6 6 | 6 6 6 6 1
        1 1 1 1 1 | 1 1 1 1 1
        ```

    It seems my previous analysis of the *transformed* output's BL quadrant was incorrect based on the prompt's output. Let's re-run the logic of the *provided code* for the BL quadrant: `first_col = modified_input_grid[:, 0]`, `bl_quadrant = np.tile(first_col_reshaped, (1, input_width))`.
    `first_col` = `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`
    Tiling this horizontally 5 times gives:
    
```
    [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
    ```

    This indeed matches the BL quadrant of the `Transformed Output` shown in the prompt results for Example 1.
    Now, comparing this `Transformed BL` with the `Expected BL`:
    `Expected BL` = `[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]` (Last row `[1,1,1,1,1]` tiled horizontally)
    The number of different pixels between `Transformed BL` and `Expected BL` is 8 (the 4s and 6s should be 1s). This still doesn't explain 45 pixels off. Let's check other quadrants.
    *   Transformed TR: `[[1, 1, 4, 6, 1], ...]` (First row `[1,1,4,6,1]` tiled vertically)
    *   Expected TR: `[[1, 1, 4, 6, 1], ...]` (First row `[1,1,4,6,1]` tiled vertically)
    TR matches. TL matches I'. BR matches I'. The only difference is BL. Why 45 pixels off? Perhaps the score calculation or the provided `Transformed Output` in the prompt has an error. Sticking to the logic derived from the expected output.

**Example 2:**
*   Input Grid (5x5): Contains white (0). Top-left color C = 2 (red).
*   Modified Input Grid (I'): Input with 0 replaced by 2.
    
```
    [[2, 2, 2, 3, 2],
     [2, 2, 2, 3, 2],
     [2, 2, 2, 3, 2],
     [3, 3, 3, 3, 2],
     [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]
    ```

*   First Column of I': `[2, 2, 2, 3, 2]`
*   Last Row of I': `[2, 2, 2, 2
