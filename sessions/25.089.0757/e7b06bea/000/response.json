            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids typically feature a vertical gray line (color 5) on the leftmost column (column 0), although it might not span the entire height or be present at all (e.g., train_3). The background is white (color 0). Towards the right side of the grid, there is a contiguous block of two or more adjacent vertical lines, each of a different, non-white, non-gray color.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the same dimensions as the input. The gray line from column 0 of the input is preserved in column 0 of the output. The block of colored vertical lines from the input is transformed into a single vertical line in the output. This new line is positioned one column to the left of where the original block started. The original positions occupied by the colored block in the input become white (color 0) in the output.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves taking the adjacent vertical colored lines from the input and \"interleaving\" or \"weaving\" them into a single column in the output. The pattern of interleaving follows the row index: for row `r`, the color used in the output's target column is taken from the `(r mod N)`-th line within the input block (where `N` is the number of lines in the block, indexed starting from 0).\n4.  **Identifying the Block:** The key is to locate the contiguous block of vertical, non-white, non-gray lines. This block defines the source colors and the target column for the output. The start column of this block is crucial for determining the output column index.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
