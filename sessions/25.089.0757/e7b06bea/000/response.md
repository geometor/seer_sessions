Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids typically feature a vertical gray line (color 5) on the leftmost column (column 0), although it might not span the entire height or be present at all (e.g., train_3). The background is white (color 0). Towards the right side of the grid, there is a contiguous block of two or more adjacent vertical lines, each of a different, non-white, non-gray color.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the same dimensions as the input. The gray line from column 0 of the input is preserved in column 0 of the output. The block of colored vertical lines from the input is transformed into a single vertical line in the output. This new line is positioned one column to the left of where the original block started. The original positions occupied by the colored block in the input become white (color 0) in the output.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves taking the adjacent vertical colored lines from the input and "interleaving" or "weaving" them into a single column in the output. The pattern of interleaving follows the row index: for row `r`, the color used in the output's target column is taken from the `(r mod N)`-th line within the input block (where `N` is the number of lines in the block, indexed starting from 0).
4.  **Identifying the Block:** The key is to locate the contiguous block of vertical, non-white, non-gray lines. This block defines the source colors and the target column for the output. The start column of this block is crucial for determining the output column index.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - Input Grid:
      - dimensions: variable height and width (within 1x1 to 30x30)
      - background_color: white (0)
      - objects:
          - type: vertical_line
            color: gray (5)
            location: typically column 0 (optional, can be partial)
            count: 0 or 1
          - type: block_of_vertical_lines
            color: various non-white (0), non-gray (5) colors
            location: right side of the grid, columns are adjacent
            properties:
              - columns are contiguous
              - each column within the block is a single color (excluding white/gray)
            count: 1
            width: variable (2 or 3 in examples)
  - Output Grid:
      - dimensions: same as input
      - background_color: white (0)
      - objects:
          - type: vertical_line (copied from input)
            color: gray (5)
            location: column 0 (if present in input)
            count: 0 or 1
          - type: interleaved_vertical_line
            color: multiple colors derived from the input block
            location: single column, positioned at `start_col - 1` (where `start_col` is the first column of the input block)
            properties:
              - Colors cycle based on row index modulo the width of the input block.
            count: 1
actions:
  - Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-gray vertical lines in the input.
  - Record the starting column index (`start_col`) and the number of columns (`N`) of this block.
  - Create an output grid of the same size as the input, initialized to white (0).
  - Copy column 0 from the input to column 0 of the output.
  - Determine the target column in the output: `target_col = start_col - 1`.
  - For each row `r`:
      - Calculate the source column index within the block: `block_col_idx = r mod N`.
      - Calculate the source column index in the input grid: `input_col = start_col + block_col_idx`.
      - Get the color `c = input[r][input_col]`.
      - Set the output pixel: `output[r][target_col] = c`.
relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are identical to the input grid dimensions.
  - The gray line at column 0 is preserved.
  - The colors composing the single output line are sourced exclusively from the input block of lines.
  - The position of the single output line is directly determined by the position (specifically the starting column) of the input block (shifted one column left).
  - The pattern of colors within the output line depends cyclically on the row index and the number of lines in the input block.
  - The area occupied by the input block becomes white in the output.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new grid (`output_grid`) with the same height and width as the `input_grid`, filling it entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Copy the contents of the first column (column 0) from the `input_grid` to the first column of the `output_grid`.
3.  Scan the `input_grid` columns from left to right, starting from column 1, to find the first column (`start_col`) that contains colors other than white (0) or gray (5) and is part of a contiguous block of such columns.
4.  Determine the number of columns (`N`) that make up this contiguous block of non-white, non-gray vertical lines starting at `start_col`.
5.  Calculate the target column index for the output: `target_col = start_col - 1`.
6.  Iterate through each row `r` of the grid (from row 0 to `height - 1`):
    a.  Determine the index of the column *within* the identified block from which to take the color: `block_col_index = r mod N`.
    b.  Calculate the actual column index in the `input_grid`: `input_source_col = start_col + block_col_index`.
    c.  Get the color value from the `input_grid` at `[r, input_source_col]`.
    d.  Place this color value into the `output_grid` at `[r, target_col]`.
7.  Return the `output_grid`.
