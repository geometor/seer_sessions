task_elements:
  - Input Grid:
      - dimensions: variable height and width (within 1x1 to 30x30)
      - background_color: white (0)
      - objects:
          - type: vertical_line
            color: gray (5)
            location: typically column 0 (optional, can be partial)
            count: 0 or 1
          - type: block_of_vertical_lines
            color: various non-white (0), non-gray (5) colors
            location: right side of the grid, columns are adjacent
            properties:
              - columns are contiguous
              - each column within the block is a single color (excluding white/gray)
            count: 1
            width: variable (2 or 3 in examples)
  - Output Grid:
      - dimensions: same as input
      - background_color: white (0)
      - objects:
          - type: vertical_line (copied from input)
            color: gray (5)
            location: column 0 (if present in input)
            count: 0 or 1
          - type: interleaved_vertical_line
            color: multiple colors derived from the input block
            location: single column, positioned at `start_col - 1` (where `start_col` is the first column of the input block)
            properties:
              - Colors cycle based on row index modulo the width of the input block.
            count: 1
actions:
  - Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-gray vertical lines in the input.
  - Record the starting column index (`start_col`) and the number of columns (`N`) of this block.
  - Create an output grid of the same size as the input, initialized to white (0).
  - Copy column 0 from the input to column 0 of the output.
  - Determine the target column in the output: `target_col = start_col - 1`.
  - For each row `r`:
      - Calculate the source column index within the block: `block_col_idx = r mod N`.
      - Calculate the source column index in the input grid: `input_col = start_col + block_col_idx`.
      - Get the color `c = input[r][input_col]`.
      - Set the output pixel: `output[r][target_col] = c`.
relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are identical to the input grid dimensions.
  - The gray line at column 0 is preserved.
  - The colors composing the single output line are sourced exclusively from the input block of lines.
  - The position of the single output line is directly determined by the position (specifically the starting column) of the input block (shifted one column left).
  - The pattern of colors within the output line depends cyclically on the row index and the number of lines in the input block.
  - The area occupied by the input block becomes white in the output.
