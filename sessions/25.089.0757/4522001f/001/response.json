It produces a 9x9 output grid.\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The output grid is initialized as a 9x9 grid filled with white (0).\n2.  **Identify Key Pixels**: Locate the position (row, column) of the red pixel (2) in the input grid. Check if any green pixels (3) exist in the input grid.\n3.  **Determine Output Pattern**: The position of the red pixel determines which pair of potential 4x4 green blocks will be drawn in the output grid, *if* green pixels are present in the input. There are four potential 4x4 block locations, defined by their top-left corners:\n    *   Top-Left (TL): (1, 1)\n    *   Top-Right (TR): (1, 5)\n    *   Bottom-Left (BL): (5, 1)\n    *   Bottom-Right (BR): (5, 5)\n    *   The selection rule is based on the parity of the sum of the red pixel's coordinates (r_red + c_red):\n        *   If (r_red + c_red) is even, the diagonal pair TL (1,1) and BR (5,5) is selected.\n        *   If (r_red + c_red) is odd, the anti-diagonal pair TR (1,5) and BL (5,1) is selected.\n4.  **Draw Blocks**: If at least one green pixel exists in the input grid, draw 4x4 blocks of green (3) in the output grid at the selected locations. Each block fills the area from `(r_start, c_start)` to `(r_start+3, c_start+3)`.\n5.  **Output**: Return the modified 9x9 output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_pixel_locations(grid, color_value):\n    \"\"\"Finds all locations (row, col) of a specific color_value in the grid.\"\"\"\n    locations = []\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] == color_value:\n                locations.append((r, c))\n    return locations\n\ndef draw_block(grid, r_start, c_start, height, width, color_value):\n    \"\"\"Draws a block of a given color in the grid.\"\"\"\n    grid[r_start:r_start+height, c_start:c_start+width] = color_value\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the location of the red pixel\n    and the presence of green pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_height, output_width = 9, 9\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid with white (0)\n    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)\n\n    # Find the red pixel location (assuming exactly one)\n    red_locations = find_pixel_locations(input_np, 2)\n    if not red_locations:\n        # Handle case where no red pixel is found (optional, based on problem constraints)\n        # For now, return the empty grid or raise an error\n        # Based on examples, a red pixel is always present.\n        return output_grid.tolist() \n    r_red, c_red = red_locations[0]\n\n    # Check for the presence of any green pixels\n    green_locations = find_pixel_locations(input_np, 3)\n    has_green = len(green_locations) > 0\n\n    # Proceed only if green pixels are present\n    if has_green:\n        # Define potential block top-left corners\n        block_locations = {\n            \"TL\": (1, 1),\n            \"TR\": (1, 5),\n            \"BL\": (5, 1),\n            \"BR\": (5, 5),\n        }\n        \n        # Determine which blocks to select based on red pixel position parity\n        selected_keys = []\n        if (r_red + c_red) % 2 == 0:\n            selected_keys = [\"TL\", \"BR\"]\n        else:\n            selected_keys = [\"TR\", \"BL\"]\n\n        # Draw the selected blocks\n        block_size = 4\n        green_color = 3\n        for key in selected_keys:\n            r_start, c_start = block_locations[key]\n            draw_block(output_grid, r_start, c_start, block_size, block_size, green_color)\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
