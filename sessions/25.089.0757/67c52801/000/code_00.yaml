task_name: gravity_on_floor
description: Apply gravity to non-background pixels, making them fall downwards until they hit another non-background pixel or the bottom row.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  background_color: 0 # white
elements:
  - element_type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer (1-9) # Non-white colors
      - is_static: False # Subject to gravity unless on bottom row or blocked
  - element_type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: 0 # white
      - is_static: True # Background, does not move
  - element_type: grid_row
    properties:
      - position: last_row # The bottom-most row of the grid
      - is_static: True # Acts as a floor, pixels do not fall from or through it. Its initial state is preserved.
actions:
  - action_type: apply_gravity
    target: non-white pixels not on the bottom row
    constraints:
      - direction: downwards (increasing row index)
      - stops_when: cell below is non-white OR cell below is out of bounds (i.e., pixel reaches the bottom row)
    effects:
      - pixel moves to the lowest available position in its column
      - original position becomes white (background color)
relationships:
  - type: support
    from: non-white pixel OR bottom_row
    to: non-white pixel above it in the same column
    description: A non-white pixel or the bottom row prevents pixels directly above it from falling further.
