            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure**: Both input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels.\n2.  **Colors**: Multiple colors are used (white, azure, green, red, gray, magenta, orange, blue). White (0) consistently acts as the background.\n3.  **Key Action**: The primary transformation appears to be a form of \"gravity\" affecting non-white pixels. Pixels or contiguous blocks of the same color seem to fall downwards within their columns.\n4.  **Stopping Condition**: Falling pixels stop when they encounter another non-white pixel directly below them or when they reach the bottom-most row of the grid.\n5.  **Bottom Row**: The bottom row of the grid seems special. It acts as a \"floor\" and its contents remain unchanged from input to output. Pixels fall onto this row or onto other pixels that have already settled.\n6.  **Independence**: The falling process appears to happen independently for each column. Pixels do not move horizontally.\n7.  **Overwriting**: When pixels fall, they vacate their original positions, leaving behind the background color (white, 0), unless another pixel falls into that vacated spot.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Within each column `c`, iterate through the rows `r` from the second-to-last row up to the top row (i.e., from `height - 2` down to `0`).\n5.  Examine the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *input* grid.\n6.  If the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid is *not* the background color (i.e., its value is > 0):\n    a.  Determine its final resting row, `dest_r`. Start searching downwards from row `r` in the *output* grid.\n    b.  Find the largest row index `k` (where `k >= r`) such that the cell `(k + 1, c)` in the output grid is either out of bounds (meaning `k` is the last row) or contains a non-background pixel. The destination row `dest_r` is this row `k`.\n    c.  Place the color of the input pixel `(r, c)` into the output grid at position `(dest_r, c)`.\n7.  After processing all columns and relevant rows, the output grid contains the final transformed state."
