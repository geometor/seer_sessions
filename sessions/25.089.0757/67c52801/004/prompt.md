```python
import numpy as np

"""
Applies a gravity effect to non-background pixels within each column of the grid independently.
Non-background pixels (colors 1-9) fall downwards within their column until they either 
reach the bottom row of the grid or land on top of another non-background pixel.
The original position of a pixel that falls is replaced with the background color (white, 0).
Pixels in the bottom row do not move. The process is applied column by column, and 
within each column, pixels are processed from the second-to-last row upwards to ensure 
lower pixels settle before pixels above them attempt to fall.
"""

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Applies gravity to non-background pixels in a grid, making them fall downwards
    within their column until they hit another pixel or the bottom of the grid.

    Args:
        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.

    Returns:
        A list of lists representing the transformed grid after gravity is applied.
