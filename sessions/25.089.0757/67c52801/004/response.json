            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code implemented a simple pixel-wise gravity model, where each non-background pixel falls independently within its column. The results clearly indicate this model is incorrect. The transformed outputs differ significantly from the expected outputs in all examples, primarily in the horizontal placement and stacking of colored elements.\n\nThe discrepancy suggests that the transformation operates on **objects** (contiguous groups of same-colored pixels) rather than individual pixels. These objects appear to fall downwards as units until they encounter another object below them (across their entire horizontal span) or the bottom of the grid. The simple column-wise gravity failed because it allowed parts of the same object to fall different distances and didn't respect the integrity of objects during the fall.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** Implement logic to identify distinct, contiguous objects of the same non-background color in the input grid.\n2.  **Object-Based Gravity:** Model the falling behavior for each identified object as a whole unit.\n3.  **Collision Detection:** Determine the final resting position of each object based on collisions with the grid bottom or other objects already settled below it. This requires checking the space beneath the entire horizontal span of the falling object.\n4.  **Simulation:** Simulate the falling process, potentially iteratively, until all objects have settled into their final positions.\n5.  **Output Construction:** Create the output grid by placing the objects in their final positions and filling the vacated spaces with the background color (white).\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's analyze the objects and their movements in each example. We need a way to identify contiguous objects.\n\n"
