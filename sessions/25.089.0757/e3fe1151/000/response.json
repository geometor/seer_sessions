The grids contain pixels represented by integers 0-9 (colors).\n2.  **Central Feature:** A prominent feature in all examples is a central cross shape made of the color orange (7). This cross consists of the middle row (row index 2) and the middle column (column index 2).\n3.  **Changes:** Differences between the input and output grids primarily involve certain orange (7) pixels being changed to other colors.\n4.  **Stability:** The central orange cross remains unchanged in all examples. Pixels that are *not* orange in the input also seem to remain unchanged.\n5.  **Target Pixels:** The pixels that change are always orange (7) pixels located *outside* the central orange cross.\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** The new color assigned to a changed orange pixel appears to depend on the colors of its neighboring pixels (considering all 8 neighbors - cardinal and diagonal). Specifically, it seems related to the unique set of colors present among its neighbors, excluding orange itself.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
