Identifies a central cross shape made of orange (7) pixels (middle row and middle column). This cross remains unchanged.\n2. Identifies all other pixels. If a pixel is not orange (7), it remains unchanged.\n3. If a pixel is orange (7) but NOT part of the central cross, its color might change based on its neighbors.\n4. To determine the new color for such an orange pixel:\n    a. Find all 8 neighbors (cardinal and diagonal).\n    b. Collect the colors of these neighbors.\n    c. Filter out any orange (7) neighbors.\n    d. Create a unique set of the remaining non-orange neighbor colors.\n    e. Apply a specific mapping rule based on this set to determine the new color. If no rule matches, the pixel remains orange (7) (though this case doesn't seem to occur in the examples).\n5. The output grid is constructed with these changes applied.\n\nSpecific Mappings Observed:\n- {white(0), blue(1), azure(8)} -> gray(5)\n- {blue(1), gray(5), azure(8)} -> white(0)\n- {green(3), azure(8), maroon(9)} -> red(2)\n- {red(2), azure(8), maroon(9)} -> green(3)\n- {green(3), yellow(4)} -> gray(5)\n- {green(3), yellow(4), gray(5)} -> yellow(4)\n- {green(3), gray(5)} -> yellow(4)\n\"\"\"\n\ndef get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, height: int, width: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"Gets coordinates of 8 neighbors for a given cell (r, c).\"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue  # Skip the cell itself\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            # Check boundaries\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                neighbors.append((nr, nc))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n    height, width = grid.shape\n\n    # Determine center row and column indices\n    center_row = height // 2\n    center_col = width // 2\n\n    # Define the color mapping based on the frozenset of unique non-orange neighbors\n    # Using frozenset because sets are mutable and cannot be dictionary keys\n    color_map: Dict[FrozenSet[int], int] = {\n        frozenset({0, 1, 8}): 5, # white, blue, azure -> gray\n        frozenset({1, 5, 8}): 0, # blue, gray, azure -> white\n        frozenset({3, 8, 9}): 2, # green, azure, maroon -> red\n        frozenset({2, 8, 9}): 3, # red, azure, maroon -> green\n        frozenset({3, 4}): 5,    # green, yellow -> gray\n        frozenset({3, 4, 5}): 4, # green, yellow, gray -> yellow\n        frozenset({3, 5}): 4     # green, gray -> yellow\n    }\n\n    # Iterate through each pixel of the input grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check if the pixel is orange (7)\n            if grid[r, c] == 7:\n                # Check if the pixel is part of the central cross\n                is_on_cross = (r == center_row) or (c == center_col)\n\n                # If it's an orange pixel *not* on the central cross, apply transformation logic\n                if not is_on_cross:\n                    # Get neighbors' coordinates\n                    neighbor_coords = get_neighbors(r, c, height, width)\n\n                    # Get neighbors' colors from the original input grid\n                    neighbor_colors = [grid[nr, nc] for nr, nc in neighbor_coords]\n\n                    # Filter out orange (7) neighbors\n                    non_orange_neighbors = [color for color in neighbor_colors if color != 7]\n\n                    # Create a unique set of non-orange neighbor colors\n                    unique_non_orange_set = frozenset(non_orange_neighbors)\n\n                    # Determine the new color using the map\n                    # If the set is found in the map, change the color in the output grid\n                    if unique_non_orange_set in color_map:\n                        output_grid[r, c] = color_map[unique_non_orange_set]\n                    # If the set is empty or not in the map, it implicitly stays orange (7)\n                    # because we copied the grid initially.
