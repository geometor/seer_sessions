These have >= 1 pixel (row 2 has 1 pixel).\n    *   Row 2: Input `0 0 0 2 0 0`. Output `0 0 0 0 0 2`. Compacted `0 0 0 0 0 2`. This one worked, even with a single pixel. Pixel was in col 3.\n*   Train 3: Rows 0, 1, 3, 4, 5. These have >= 1 pixel (rows 4, 5 have 1 pixel).\n    *   Row 4: Input `0 0 0 0 3 0`. Output `0 0 0 0 0 3`. Compacted `0 0 0 0 0 3`. Worked. Pixel in col 4.\n    *   Row 5: Input `8 0 0 0 0 0`. Output `0 0 0 0 0 8`. Compacted `0 0 0 0 0 8`. Worked. Pixel in col 0.\n\nWhy did Row 2/Train 3 (`6 0 0 0 0 0` -> `... 6 0`) fail, but Row 5/Train 3 (`8 0 0 0 0 0` -> `... 0 8`) work? Both have a single pixel at col 0. This contradicts the \"single pixel needs special handling\" idea.\n\nLet's re-re-examine the outputs for the \"failed\" rows and compare to the \"compacted\" version:\n*   Train 1, Row 0: Input `0 3 0 0 0 0`. Compacted `...0 3`. Output `...3 0`.\n*   Train 2, Row 5: Input `... 3 0 ...`. Compacted `...0 3`. Output `...3 0`.\n*   Train 3, Row 2: Input `6 0 0 0 0 0`. Compacted `...0 6`. Output `...6 0`.\n\nIt appears the transformation is:\n1.  For each row:\n2.  Extract the sequence of non-white pixels.\n3.  Place this sequence in a new row of the same width, right-aligned. Let this be the \"compacted row\".\n4.  **Modification Step:** If the compacted row has a non-white pixel in the *last* column (`width-1`), check the corresponding input row. If the input row *also* had a non-white pixel in the last column, do nothing. Otherwise (if the input row's last column was white, but the compacted row's last column is non-white), shift the *entire non-white pattern* in the compacted row one step to the left.\n\nLet's test this modified hypothesis:\n\n*   **Train 1:** Width=6. Last col index=5.\n    *   Row 0: Input `0 3 0 0 0 0`. Compacted `0 0 0 0 0 3`.\n        *   Compacted[5] = 3 (non-white). Input[5] = 0 (white).\n        *   Condition met. Shift `...0 3` left by 1 -> `...3 0`. Final: `0 0 0 0 3 0`. (Matches output).\n    *   Row 1: Input `0 3 0 2 0 0`. Compacted `0 0 0 0 3 2`.\n        *   Compacted[5] = 2 (non-white). Input[5] = 0 (white).\n        *   Condition met. Shift `...3 2` left by 1 -> `...3 2 0`. Final: `0 0 0 3 2 0`. (Does NOT match output `...0 3 2`). Hypothesis is wrong.\n\nMaybe the condition is simpler. Does the *original* row end with white?\n*   Train 1, Row 0: `0 3 0 0 0 0`. Ends white. Compacted `...0 3`. Shift left -> `...3 0`. Matches.\n*   Train 1, Row 1: `0 3 0 2 0 0`. Ends white. Compacted `...3 2`. Shift left -> `...3 2 0`. Does not match `...0 3 2`.\n*   Train 1, Row 3: `0 8 0 0 2 2`. Ends non-white. Compacted `...8 2 2`. Do not shift left. Matches.\n*   Train 1, Row 4: `0 0 0 0 2 2`. Ends non-white. Compacted `...0 2 2`. Do not shift left. Matches.\n\nThis \"shift left if original row ends white\" rule also fails.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure. What if we copy columns based on some criteria?\n\n**Hypothesis: Copy Columns Containing Maxima**\n1. Find the maximum value (color index) in the entire input grid. Let it be `max_val`.\n2. Identify all columns that contain at least one pixel with `max_val`. Let this set of column indices be `S`.\n3. Sort `S`.\n4. Create the output grid by taking only the columns specified by `S` from the input grid and placing them contiguously at the right edge of the output grid.\n\n*   **Train 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[0,3,0,0,0,0],[0,3,0,2,0,0],[0,0,0,2,0,0],[0,8,0,0,2,2],[0,0,0,0,2,2],[6,6,6,0,0,0]]`\n    *   `max_val` = 8 (Azure).\n    *   Pixel `8` is at (3, 1).\n    *   Column containing `max_val` is column 1. `S = {1}`. Sorted `S = [1]`. `|S|=1`.\n    *   Output width = 6. Output column = `6 - 1 + 0 = 5`.\n    *   Output col 5 <- Input col 1 = `[3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 6]`^T\n    *   Predicted output:\n        "
