The number of non-white pixels is conserved. This confirms that pixels are moved, not created or destroyed.

Let's rethink the "compaction" idea. What if it's not just within a row, but considers columns?

Consider the columns containing non-white pixels in the input. Let these be `C_in`.
Consider the columns containing non-white pixels in the output. Let these be `C_out`.

*   **Train 1:** `C_in = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`. `C_out = {3, 4, 5}`. `|C_in|=6`, `|C_out|=3`.
*   **Train 2:** `C_in = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}`. `C_out = {10, 11, 12}`. `|C_in|=7`, `|C_out|=3`.
*   **Train 3:** `C_in = {0, 1, 2, 4}`. `C_out = {4, 5}`. `|C_in|=4`, `|C_out|=2`.

In all cases, the number of output columns seems much smaller. How is the number of output columns determined?

Let's look at the input columns more closely.
*   **Train 1:**
    *   Col 0: [0,0,0,0,0,6] -> 1 non-white
    *   Col 1: [3,3,0,8,0,6] -> 4 non-white
    *   Col 2: [0,0,0,0,0,6] -> 1 non-white
    *   Col 3: [0,2,2,0,0,0] -> 2 non-white
    *   Col 4: [0,0,0,2,2,0] -> 2 non-white
    *   Col 5: [0,0,0,2,2,0] -> 2 non-white
*   **Train 2:**
    *   Col 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0] -> 1 non-white
    *   Col 2: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0] -> 2 non-white
    *   Col 3: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] -> 2 non-white

    *   Col 7: [0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0] -> 2 non-white
    *   Col 8: [0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0] -> 2 non-white
*   **Train 3:**
    *   Col 0: [0,6,6,0,0,8] -> 3 non-white
    *   Col 1: [2,0,0,0,0,0] -> 1 non-white
    *   Col 2: [2,2,0,8,0,0] -> 3 non-white
    *   Col 4: [0,0,0,3,3,0] -> 2 non-white

Let's look at the output columns.
*   **Train 1:**
    *   Col 3: [0,0,0,8,0,6] -> 2 non-white
    *   Col 4: [3,3,0,0,2,6] -> 4 non-white
    *   Col 5: [0,2,2,2,2,6] -> 5 non-white (Error in my manual trace earlier? Let's check the output again: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]`, `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2]`, `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`, `[0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2]`, `[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]`, `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]`)
    *   Col 3: [0,0,0,8,0,6] -> 2 pixels
    *   Col 4: [3,3,0,2,2,6] -> 5 pixels
    *   Col 5: [0,2,2,2,2,6] -> 5 pixels
    *   Total Output = 2 + 5 + 5 = 12. Matches.
*   **Train 2:**
    *   Col 10: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,6,0,0] -> 4 pixels
    *   Col 11: [0,2,5,5,3,3,0,6,0,0] -> 6 pixels

    *   Let's recheck output: `[...2 2 0 0]`, `[...0 2 5 5]`, `[...0 0 5 5]`, `[...0 0 3 3]`, `[...0 0 3 0]`, `[...0 6 6 8]`.
    *   Col 10: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] -> 1 pixel
    *   Col 11: [0,2,2,0,3,3,0,6,0,0] -> 5 pixels
    *   Col 12: [0,0,5,5,3,0,0,8,0,0] -> 4 pixels (Wait, output row 7 has `6 6 8`. Input row 7 has `6 6` at 1,2 and `8` at 6. Output row 7: `... 6 6 8`. Pixels at 10, 11, 12. `6` at 10, `6` at 11, `8` at 12. Let's recount).
    *   Col 10: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0] -> 2 pixels
    *   Col 11: [0,2,2,0,3,3,0,6,0,0] -> 6 pixels. (Checking row 5 output: `... 0 3 0`. So pixel at (5,11)).
    *   Col 12: [0,0,5,5,3,0,0,8,0,0] -> 4 pixels. (Checking row 4 output: `... 0 3 3`. Pixels at (4,11), (4,12)).
    *   Let's list output pixels by column:
        *   Col 10: (1,10)=2, (7,10)=6 -> 2 pixels
        *   Col 11: (1,11)=2, (2,11)=2, (3,11)=5, (4,11)=3, (5,11)=3, (7,11)=6 -> 6 pixels
        *   Col 12: (2,12)=5, (3,12)=5, (4,12)=3, (7,12)=8 -> 4 pixels
    *   Total = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. Input count was 13. Where did one pixel go?
    *   Let's recount input train_2 non-white: R1:2, R2:3, R3:2, R4:2, R5:1, R7:3 = 2+3+2+2+1+3 = 13. Okay.
    *   Let's recount output train_2 non-white: R1:2, R2:3, R3:2, R4:2, R5:1, R7:3 = 13. Okay, my column count above was wrong.
        *   Col 10: (1,10)=2, (7,10)=6 -> 2 pixels
        *   Col 11: (1,11)=2, (2,11)=2, (3,11)=5, (4,11)=3, (5,11)=3, (7,11)=6 -> 6 pixels
        *   Col 12: (2,12)=5, (3,12)=5, (4,12)=3, (7,12)=8 -> 4 pixels. Total is 12. Still missing one.
        *   Let's look at the output image again carefully.
            Row 0: 0
            Row 1: 2 2 (cols 10, 11)
            Row 2: 2 5 5 (cols 10, 11, 12) -> Error in my manual grid above. Output should be `... 0 2 5 5`. Let me correct.
            Row 3: 5 5 (cols 11, 12)
            Row 4: 3 3 (cols 11, 12)

            Row 6: 0
            Row 7: 6 6 8 (cols 10, 11, 12)
            Row 8: 0
            Row 9: 0
        *   Recounting output pixels:
            Col 10: (1,10)=2, (2,10)=?, (7,10)=6. Oh wait, row 2 output is `... 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 5 5`. Pixel (2,10) is `0`. So, Col 10 has (1,10)=2, (7,10)=6 -> 2 pixels.
            Col 11: (1,11)=2, (2,11)=?, (3,11)=5, (4,11)=3, (5,11)=3, (7,11)=6. Row 2 output pixel at (2,11) is `5`. So, Col 11 has (1,11)=2, (2,11)=5, (3,11)=5, (4,11)=3, (5,11)=3, (7,11)=6 -> 6 pixels.
            Col 12: (2,12)=5, (3,12)=5, (4,12)=3, (7,12)=8 -> 4 pixels.
            Total = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. Still missing one.
        *   Let's re-examine the input/output pair 2.
            Input:
            
```
            0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
            0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  (2,3) (2,4) -> 2 pixels
            0 0 0 2 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0  (2,3), (2,7), (2,8) -> 3 pixels
            0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0  (3,7), (3,8) -> 2 pixels
            0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  (4,4), (4,5) -> 2 pixels
            0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  (5,4) -> 1 pixel

            ...
            ```

            Total input pixels = 2+3+2+2+1+3 = 13.
            Output:
            
```
            0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
            0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0  (1,9), (1,10) -> 2 pixels (Indices start from 0, so cols 9, 10)
            0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 5 5  (2,10), (2,11), (2,12) -> 3 pixels
            0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5  (3,11), (3,12) -> 2 pixels
            0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3  (4,11), (4,12) -> 2 pixels
            0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0  (5,11) -> 1 pixel
            0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
            0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 8  (7,10), (7,11), (7,12) -> 3 pixels
            ...
            ```

            Total output pixels = 2+3+2+2+1+3 = 13. Okay, the counts match. My previous analysis of the output grid image was incorrect about indices.
            Output columns with content: 9, 10, 11, 12. There are 4 columns.
            Wait, let's re-read the output grid provided in the prompt.
            
```
            ... 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0  <- Row 1: cols 9, 10
            ... 0 0 0 2 5 5      <- Row 2: cols 10, 11, 12
            ... 0 0 0 5 5      <- Row 3: cols 11, 12
            ... 0 0 0 3 3      <- Row 4: cols 11, 12
            ... 0 0 0 3 0      <- Row 5: col 11
            ... 0 6 6 8      <- Row 7: cols 10, 11, 12
            ```

            Output columns with content are indeed 9, 10, 11, 12. Size is 4.
            Input columns with content were 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8. Size is 7.
            How are 7 input columns mapped to 4 output columns?

*   **Train 3:**
    *   `C_in = {0, 1, 2, 4}`. Size 4.
    *   `C_out = {4, 5}`. Size 2.
    *   How are 4 input columns mapped to 2 output columns?

Maybe it's about identifying specific "key" columns in the input?
What if we only keep columns that have a certain number of pixels? Or columns adjacent to empty space?

Let's look at the number of non-white pixels per column again:
*   **Train 1:** [1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2] (for cols 0-5) -> Output uses 3 cols.
*   **Train 2:** [1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2] (for cols 1-8) -> Output uses 4 cols.
*   **Train 3:** [3, 1, 3, 0, 2] (for cols 0-4) -> Output uses 2 cols.

Is there a threshold? If we keep columns with > 1 pixel?
*   Train 1: Keep cols 1, 3, 4, 5 (4 cols). Output has 3. No.
*   Train 2: Keep cols 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 (5 cols). Output has 4. No.
*   Train 3: Keep cols 0, 2, 4 (3 cols). Output has 2. No.

What if we identify columns based on vertical lines?
*   Train 1: No clear vertical lines.
*   Train 2: Col 7 and 8 have `5 5` vertically aligned. Col 4 has `3 3`. Col 2 has `6 6`.
*   Train 3: Col 0 has `6 6`. Col 2 has `2 2`. Col 4 has `3 3`.

Consider the columns that form the *right edge* of any object.
*   **Train 1:**
    *   Green L: Col 1
    *   Red group: Col 5
    *   Azure dot: Col 1
    *   Magenta bar: Col 2
    *   Rightmost columns: {1, 2, 5}. Size 3. This matches the number of output columns!
*   **Train 2:**
    *   Red 2x2: Col 3
    *   Gray 2x2: Col 8
    *   Green 1x2: Col 5
    *   Green dot: Col 4
    *   Magenta 1x2: Col 2
    *   Azure dot: Col 6
    *   Rightmost columns: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}. Size 6. Output has 4 columns. Doesn't match.
    *   Maybe "object" definition matters? Let's use contiguous blocks of same color.
        *   Object 1 (Red): (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). Rightmost col = 3.
        *   Object 2 (Gray): (2,7), (2,8), (3,7), (3,8). Rightmost col = 8.
        *   Object 3 (Green): (4,4), (4,5). Rightmost col = 5.
        *   Object 4 (Green): (5,4). Rightmost col = 4.
        *   Object 5 (Magenta): (7,1), (7,2). Rightmost col = 2.
        *   Object 6 (Azure): (7,6). Rightmost col = 6.
    *   Rightmost columns for each object: {3, 8, 5, 4, 2, 6}. Sorted: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}. Size 6. Still doesn't match output size 4.
*   **Train 3:**
    *   Object 1 (Red): (0,1), (0,2), (1,2). Rightmost col = 2.
    *   Object 2 (Magenta): (1,0), (2,0). Rightmost col = 0.
    *   Object 3 (Azure): (3,2). Rightmost col = 2.
    *   Object 4 (Green): (3,4), (4,4). Rightmost col = 4.
    *   Object 5 (Azure): (5,0). Rightmost col = 0.
    *   Rightmost columns for each object: {2, 0, 2, 4, 0}. Sorted unique: {0, 2, 4}. Size 3. Output has 2 columns. Doesn't match.

**New Hypothesis: Extract Columns Containing the Rightmost Pixel of *any* Object**

1.  Identify all contiguous objects of the same color (non-white).
2.  For each object, find the maximum column index (`max_c`) it occupies.
3.  Collect the set of all such `max_c` values from all objects. Let this set be `S`.
4.  Sort the column indices in `S` in ascending order.
5.  Create a new grid (output grid) with the same dimensions as the input, initially all white.
6.  Iterate through the sorted column indices `c` in `S`. For the `k`-th column index in `S` (0-indexed):
    *   Take the entire column `c` from the *input* grid.
    *   Place this column into the *output* grid at column index `output_width - |S| + k`. (Aligning the selected columns to the right edge).

Let's test this hypothesis:

*   **Train 1:**
    *   Objects: Green L, Red group, Azure dot, Magenta bar.
    *   Rightmost columns:
        *   Green L: col 1
        *   Red group: col 5
        *   Azure dot: col 1
        *   Magenta bar: col 2
    *   Set `S = {1, 2, 5}`. Sorted `S = [1, 2, 5]`. `|S| = 3`. Output width = 6.
    *   Output columns will be `6 - 3 + 0 = 3`, `6 - 3 + 1 = 4`, `6 - 3 + 2 = 5`.
    *   Output col 3 <- Input col 1 = `[3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 6]`^T
    *   Output col 4 <- Input col 2 = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`^T
    *   Output col 5 <- Input col 5 = `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]`^T
    *   Constructing the output:
        
```
        . . . 3 0 0
        . . . 3 0 0
        . . . 0 0 0
        . . . 8 0 2
        . . . 0 0 2
        . . . 6 6 0
        ```

    *   This does **not** match the expected output `train_1_out`.

*   **Train 2:**
    *   Objects: Red L, Gray square, Green bar, Green dot, Magenta bar, Azure dot.
    *   Rightmost columns: {3, 8, 5, 4, 2, 6}.
    *   Set `S = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}`. Sorted `S = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]`. `|S| = 6`. Output width = 13.
    *   Output columns will be `13 - 6 + k` for `k=0..5`: cols 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
    *   This predicts 6 output columns, but the actual output has 4 (cols 9, 10, 11, 12). Hypothesis is incorrect.

*   **Train 3:**
    *   Objects: Red group, Magenta bar, Azure dot, Green bar, Azure dot.
    *   Rightmost columns: {2, 0, 2, 4, 0}.
    *   Set `S = {0, 2, 4}`. Sorted `S = [0, 2, 4]`. `|S| = 3`. Output width = 6.
    *   Output columns will be `6 - 3 + k` for `k=0..2`: cols 3, 4, 5.
    *   This predicts 3 output columns, but the actual output has 2 (cols 4, 5). Hypothesis is incorrect.

**Revisiting the "Compact Right Within Row" Idea**

Maybe the rows that failed were exceptions for a reason?
*   Train 1, Row 0: Input `0 3 0 0 0 0`. Output `0 0 0 0 3 0`. Compacted: `0 0 0 0 0 3`. Difference: Output shifted left by 1.
*   Train 2, Row 5: Input `... 3 0 ...`. Output `... 3 0`. Compacted: `... 0 3`. Difference: Output shifted left by 1.
*   Train 3, Row 2: Input `6 0 0 0 0 0`. Output `0 0 0 0 6 0`. Compacted: `0 0 0 0 0 6`. Difference: Output shifted left by 1.

In all failed cases, the row contains only *one* non-white pixel, and the output seems to be the "compact right" version shifted left by one column. Why?

Is it related to the column the single pixel was in?
*   Train 1, Row 0: Pixel in col 1. Shift left.
*   Train 2, Row 5: Pixel in col 4. Shift left.
*   Train 3, Row 2: Pixel in col 0. Shift left.

This doesn't seem consistent.

Let's look at the rows that worked with "compact right":
*   Train 1: Rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. These have >= 1 pixel (row 2 has 1 pixel).
    *   Row 2: Input `0 0 0 2 0 0`. Output `0 0 0 0 0 2`. Compacted `0 0 0 0 0 2`. This one worked, even with a single pixel. Pixel was in col 3.
*   Train 3: Rows 0, 1, 3, 4, 5. These have >= 1 pixel (rows 4, 5 have 1 pixel).
    *   Row 4: Input `0 0 0 0 3 0`. Output `0 0 0 0 0 3`. Compacted `0 0 0 0 0 3`. Worked. Pixel in col 4.
    *   Row 5: Input `8 0 0 0 0 0`. Output `0 0 0 0 0 8`. Compacted `0 0 0 0 0 8`. Worked. Pixel in col 0.

Why did Row 2/Train 3 (`6 0 0 0 0 0` -> `... 6 0`) fail, but Row 5/Train 3 (`8 0 0 0 0 0` -> `... 0 8`) work? Both have a single pixel at col 0. This contradicts the "single pixel needs special handling" idea.

Let's re-re-examine the outputs for the "failed" rows and compare to the "compacted" version:
*   Train 1, Row 0: Input `0 3 0 0 0 0`. Compacted `...0 3`. Output `...3 0`.
*   Train 2, Row 5: Input `... 3 0 ...`. Compacted `...0 3`. Output `...3 0`.
*   Train 3, Row 2: Input `6 0 0 0 0 0`. Compacted `...0 6`. Output `...6 0`.

It appears the transformation is:
1.  For each row:
2.  Extract the sequence of non-white pixels.
3.  Place this sequence in a new row of the same width, right-aligned. Let this be the "compacted row".
4.  **Modification Step:** If the compacted row has a non-white pixel in the *last* column (`width-1`), check the corresponding input row. If the input row *also* had a non-white pixel in the last column, do nothing. Otherwise (if the input row's last column was white, but the compacted row's last column is non-white), shift the *entire non-white pattern* in the compacted row one step to the left.

Let's test this modified hypothesis:

*   **Train 1:** Width=6. Last col index=5.
    *   Row 0: Input `0 3 0 0 0 0`. Compacted `0 0 0 0 0 3`.
        *   Compacted[5] = 3 (non-white). Input[5] = 0 (white).
        *   Condition met. Shift `...0 3` left by 1 -> `...3 0`. Final: `0 0 0 0 3 0`. (Matches output).
    *   Row 1: Input `0 3 0 2 0 0`. Compacted `0 0 0 0 3 2`.
        *   Compacted[5] = 2 (non-white). Input[5] = 0 (white).
        *   Condition met. Shift `...3 2` left by 1 -> `...3 2 0`. Final: `0 0 0 3 2 0`. (Does NOT match output `...0 3 2`). Hypothesis is wrong.

Maybe the condition is simpler. Does the *original* row end with white?
*   Train 1, Row 0: `0 3 0 0 0 0`. Ends white. Compacted `...0 3`. Shift left -> `...3 0`. Matches.
*   Train 1, Row 1: `0 3 0 2 0 0`. Ends white. Compacted `...3 2`. Shift left -> `...3 2 0`. Does not match `...0 3 2`.
*   Train 1, Row 3: `0 8 0 0 2 2`. Ends non-white. Compacted `...8 2 2`. Do not shift left. Matches.
*   Train 1, Row 4: `0 0 0 0 2 2`. Ends non-white. Compacted `...0 2 2`. Do not shift left. Matches.

This "shift left if original row ends white" rule also fails.

Let's reconsider the structure. What if we copy columns based on some criteria?

**Hypothesis: Copy Columns Containing Maxima**
1. Find the maximum value (color index) in the entire input grid. Let it be `max_val`.
2. Identify all columns that contain at least one pixel with `max_val`. Let this set of column indices be `S`.
3. Sort `S`.
4. Create the output grid by taking only the columns specified by `S` from the input grid and placing them contiguously at the right edge of the output grid.

*   **Train 1:**
    *   Input: `[[0,3,0,0,0,0],[0,3,0,2,0,0],[0,0,0,2,0,0],[0,8,0,0,2,2],[0,0,0,0,2,2],[6,6,6,0,0,0]]`
    *   `max_val` = 8 (Azure).
    *   Pixel `8` is at (3, 1).
    *   Column containing `max_val` is column 1. `S = {1}`. Sorted `S = [1]`. `|S|=1`.
    *   Output width = 6. Output column = `6 - 1 + 0 = 5`.
    *   Output col 5 <- Input col 1 = `[3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 6]`^T
    *   Predicted output:
        
```
        . . . . . 3
        . . . . . 3
        . . . . . 0
        . . . . . 8
        . . . . . 0
        . . . . . 6
        ```

    *   Does not match.

*   **Train 2:**
    *   Input contains 2, 5, 3, 6, 8. `max_val` = 8 (Azure).
    *   Pixel 8 is at (7, 6).
    *   Column containing `max_val` is column 6. `S = {6}`. Sorted `S = [6]`. `|S|=1`.
    *   Output width = 13. Output column = `13 - 1 + 0 = 12`.
    *   Output col 12 <- Input col 6 = `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]`^T
    *   Predicted output is mostly white with col 12 containing `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]`^T. Does not match.

*   **Train 3:**
    *   Input contains 2, 6, 8, 3. `max_val` = 8 (Azure).
    *   Pixel 8 is at (3, 2) and (5, 0).
    *   Columns containing `max_val` are {0, 2}. `S = {0, 2}`. Sorted `S = [0, 2]`. `|S|=2`.
    *   Output width = 6. Output columns = `6 - 2 + 0 = 4`, `6 - 2 + 1 = 5`.
    *   Output col 4 <- Input col 0 = `[0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8]`^T
    *   Output col 5 <-
