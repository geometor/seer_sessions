The output grid consistently has the same height as the input grid but exactly twice the width.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The input grids contain only white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grids contain white (0), red (2), and azure (8) pixels.\n3.  **Output Composition:** The output grid appears to be composed of two distinct halves, placed side-by-side horizontally.\n    *   The **right half** of the output grid is an identical copy of the original input grid.\n    *   The **left half** of the output grid has the same dimensions and structure (arrangement of non-white pixels) as the input grid, but every red (2) pixel from the input has been replaced with an azure (8) pixel. White (0) pixels remain white (0) in this left half.\n4.  **Transformation Rule:** The core transformation involves creating a modified version of the input grid where red is changed to azure, and then concatenating this modified version horizontally with the original input grid.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
