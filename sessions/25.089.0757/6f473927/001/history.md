Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The task takes an input grid and produces an output grid. The output grid consistently has the same height as the input grid but exactly twice the width.
2.  **Color Palette:** The input grids contain only white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grids contain white (0), red (2), and azure (8) pixels.
3.  **Output Composition:** The output grid appears to be composed of two distinct halves, placed side-by-side horizontally.
    *   The **right half** of the output grid is an identical copy of the original input grid.
    *   The **left half** of the output grid has the same dimensions and structure (arrangement of non-white pixels) as the input grid, but every red (2) pixel from the input has been replaced with an azure (8) pixel. White (0) pixels remain white (0) in this left half.
4.  **Transformation Rule:** The core transformation involves creating a modified version of the input grid where red is changed to azure, and then concatenating this modified version horizontally with the original input grid.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - colors_present_input: [white (0), red (2)]
      - colors_present_output: [white (0), red (2), azure (8)]
      - relationship_input_output_dimensions: output height is same as input height, output width is double input width
actions:
  - action: copy
    source: input_grid
    target: right_half_of_output_grid
  - action: transform_copy
    source: input_grid
    target: left_half_of_output_grid
    rule:
      - condition: pixel is red (2)
        result: change pixel to azure (8)
      - condition: pixel is white (0)
        result: keep pixel as white (0)
  - action: concatenate
    direction: horizontal
    item1: transformed_copy (left_half_of_output_grid)
    item2: original_copy (right_half_of_output_grid)
    result: final_output_grid
relationships:
  - type: spatial_composition
    description: The output grid is formed by placing the transformed grid to the left of the original input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input grid. Let its dimensions be H (height) and W (width).
2.  Create a new grid, called `transformed_grid`, of the same dimensions (H x W).
3.  For each pixel in the input grid at position (row, column):
    a.  If the pixel's color is red (2), set the corresponding pixel in `transformed_grid` at (row, column) to azure (8).
    b.  If the pixel's color is white (0), set the corresponding pixel in `transformed_grid` at (row, column) to white (0).
4.  Create the final output grid with dimensions H x (2 * W).
5.  Place the `transformed_grid` into the left half of the output grid (columns 0 to W-1).
6.  Place the original input grid into the right half of the output grid (columns W to 2*W-1).
7.  Return the final output grid.
