task_description: Concatenate a modified version of the input grid with the original input grid.
grid_properties:
  - input_grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9). Variable dimensions (height H, width W).
  - output_grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9). Dimensions are H x (2*W).
transformation:
  - step_1_modify: Create a temporary grid by copying the input grid.
  - step_2_recolor: In the temporary grid, change all pixels with the color red (2) to the color azure (8). All other colors remain unchanged.
  - step_3_concatenate: Create the output grid with dimensions H x (2*W).
  - step_4_place_left: Place the modified temporary grid into the left half of the output grid (columns 0 to W-1).
  - step_5_place_right: Place the original input grid into the right half of the output grid (columns W to 2*W-1).
object_focus: The transformation acts on individual pixels based on their color value.
color_mapping:
  - input_color: red (2)
  - output_color: azure (8) (in the left half only)
  - preservation: All other colors (including white/background 0) are preserved in their respective halves.
structure: The output grid is a horizontal concatenation of the modified grid and the original grid.
