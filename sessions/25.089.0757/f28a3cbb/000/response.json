The rest of the grid is primarily filled with a third, dominant \"background\" color, interspersed with scattered pixels matching the corner block colors or other colors. The transformation involves expanding the corner blocks and cleaning up the rest of the grid. The top-left block expands one column to the right. The bottom-right block expands one row upwards. All pixels in the output grid that are not part of these expanded corner blocks take on the background color. The background color appears to be the most frequent color in the input grid, excluding the colors of the two corner blocks.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
