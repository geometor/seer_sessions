task_context:
  problem_description: "The task involves modifying a grid based on its corner colors and the most frequent non-corner color. Specifically, it draws fixed-size blocks in the top-left and bottom-right corners using the respective corner colors, against a background filled with the most frequent non-corner color."
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions: Same for input and output in each example (9x9).
    - color_palette: Maintained between input and output, though distribution changes.
objects:
  - object_type: CornerPixelTL
    description: "The pixel at the top-left corner (0,0)."
    properties:
      - color: Defines the color for the top-left block in the output.
        (Example 1: 9-maroon, Example 2: 2-red)
  - object_type: CornerPixelBR
    description: "The pixel at the bottom-right corner (H-1, W-1)."
    properties:
      - color: Defines the color for the bottom-right block in the output.
        (Example 1: 4-yellow, Example 2: 5-gray)
  - object_type: Background
    description: "The most frequent color in the input grid, excluding the colors of CornerPixelTL and CornerPixelBR."
    properties:
      - color: Fills the majority of the output grid.
        (Example 1: 6-gray, Example 2: 6-gray)
  - object_type: OutputBlockTL
    description: "A fixed-size block placed in the top-left corner of the output grid."
    properties:
      - size: 4x4 pixels.
      - position: Top-left corner (rows 0-3, cols 0-3).
      - color: Same as CornerPixelTL color.
  - object_type: OutputBlockBR
    description: "A fixed-size block placed in the bottom-right corner of the output grid."
    properties:
      - size: 3x3 pixels.
      - position: Bottom-right corner (rows H-3 to H-1, cols W-3 to W-1).
      - color: Same as CornerPixelBR color.
actions:
  - action: IdentifyCornerColors
    description: "Determine the color of the top-left pixel (TL_Color) and the bottom-right pixel (BR_Color) from the input grid."
  - action: IdentifyBackgroundColor
    description: "Count the frequency of all colors in the input grid. Identify the color with the highest frequency, excluding TL_Color and BR_Color. This is the Background Color (BG_Color)."
  - action: CreateOutputGrid
    description: "Generate a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid."
  - action: FillBackground
    description: "Fill the entire output grid with the BG_Color."
  - action: DrawTopLeftBlock
    description: "Overwrite the top-left 4x4 region of the output grid with the TL_Color."
  - action: DrawBottomRightBlock
    description: "Overwrite the bottom-right 3x3 region of the output grid with the BR_Color."
