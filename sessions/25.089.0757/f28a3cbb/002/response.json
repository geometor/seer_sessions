            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core transformation concept: identifying top-left (TL) and bottom-right (BR) corner colors, determining a background color (BG), initializing the output with BG, and then drawing shapes in the corners with the TL and BR colors. However, the assumption that the corner shapes are fixed-size rectangles (3x4 for TL, 4x3 for BR) is incorrect, leading to mismatches in both provided examples.\n\nThe strategy is to re-examine the relationship between the input and output grids, specifically focusing on how the TL and BR colored shapes in the output are determined. The background color determination seems correct. The primary task is to find the rule governing the size and placement of the TL and BR shapes in the output.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the examples to understand the shapes better.\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput:\n"
