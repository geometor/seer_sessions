task_description: "Expand the 3x3 colored blocks found in the top-left and bottom-right corners of the input grid into 4x4 blocks in the output grid, placing them in the corresponding corners. Fill the rest of the output grid with the most common color from the input grid, excluding the corner colors."

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same dimensions (H x W).
  - background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid, excluding the top-left and bottom-right pixel colors.

objects:
  - object: top_left_corner_block
    input_properties:
      - color: Determined by the pixel at input[0, 0].
      - shape: Always a 3x3 square.
      - location: Top-left corner, coordinates (0,0) to (2,2).
    output_properties:
      - color: Same as the input top_left_corner_block color.
      - shape: Always a 4x4 square.
      - location: Top-left corner, coordinates (0,0) to (3,3).
  - object: bottom_right_corner_block
    input_properties:
      - color: Determined by the pixel at input[H-1, W-1].
      - shape: Always a 3x3 square.
      - location: Bottom-right corner, coordinates (H-3, W-3) to (H-1, W-1).
    output_properties:
      - color: Same as the input bottom_right_corner_block color.
      - shape: Always a 4x4 square.
      - location: Bottom-right corner, coordinates (H-4, W-4) to (H-1, W-1).
  - object: background
    properties:
      - color: The determined background_color.
      - shape: Fills the entire output grid initially.
      - location: Covers all cells not occupied by the output corner blocks.
