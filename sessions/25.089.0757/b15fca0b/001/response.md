"""
Identify the locations of all red (2) pixels in the input grid.
Perform a flood fill (Breadth-First Search - BFS) starting from the white (0) neighbors of the red pixels.
The flood fill traverses only through white (0) pixels. Blue (1) pixels act as barriers.
All white (0) pixels visited during the flood fill are changed to yellow (4) in the output grid.
All other pixels (blue, red, and unvisited white) remain unchanged.
