## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided code correctly identifies the 2x2 non-white source block and determines the colors for the four corner blocks based on the pixels diagonally opposite within the source block. It successfully transforms Examples 2 and 3.

However, the code fails on Example 1. The failure occurs because the code copies the entire input grid to the output grid *before* painting the corner blocks. In Example 1, the source block is located near the top-left, causing the painting of the new top-left corner block (using color D=1) and the top-right corner block (using color C=2) to overwrite parts of the original source block (colors 4, 6, 2, 1) that were copied initially.

The expected output for Example 1, along with the successful transformations in Examples 2 and 3, indicates that the output grid should start as a blank (white) canvas of the same dimensions as the input. The only colored pixels in the output should be the four 2x2 corner blocks derived from the input's source block. The original source block itself, and any other non-white pixels from the input, are *not* transferred to the output.

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the transformation logic to initialize the output grid as entirely white (filled with 0s) instead of copying the input.
2.  Keep the logic for finding the source 2x2 block in the input.
3.  Keep the logic for determining the colors for the four corner blocks based on the diagonally opposite pixels in the source block.
4.  Paint these four 2x2 corner blocks onto the initially white output grid.

## Metrics

Let's gather metrics on the source block identified in each input example.

            # Check if all four cells in the 2x2 block starting at (r, c) are non-white
            if (grid[r, c] != 0 and
                grid[r, c+1] != 0 and
                grid[r+1, c] != 0 and
                grid[r+1, c+1] != 0):
                block_info['found'] = True
                block_info['r'] = r

                block_info['D'] = grid[r+1, c+1]   # Bottom-right
                return block_info # Found the first (and only) one
    return block_info

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Example 1 Info: {'found': True, 'r': 1, 'c': 1, 'A': np.int64(4), 'B': np.int64(6), 'C': np.int64(2), 'D': np.int64(1), 'H': 6, 'W': 6}
Example 2 Info: {'found': True, 'r': 2, 'c': 2, 'A': np.int64(9), 'B': np.int64(3), 'C': np.int64(7), 'D': np.int64(8), 'H': 6, 'W': 6}
Example 3 Info: {'found': True, 'r': 2, 'c': 2, 'A': np.int64(3), 'B': np.int64(6), 'C': np.int64(5), 'D': np.int64(2), 'H': 6, 'W': 6}
Example 1 Derived Corner Colors: TL=1, TR=2, BL=6, BR=4
Example 2 Derived Corner Colors: TL=8, TR=7, BL=3, BR=9
Example 3 Derived Corner Colors: TL=2, TR=5, BL=6, BR=3

```
The metrics confirm the source block locations and the derived colors for the corner blocks match the expected outputs in all three examples. This reinforces the conclusion that the error in Example 1 stemmed solely from incorrectly preserving the input grid content in the output, rather than starting with a white background.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Place colored blocks in corners based on a source block.

Input Grid:
  - Contains a single 2x2 block of non-white pixels (source_block) surrounded by white pixels.
  - Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 6x6 in examples).
  - Background Color: White (0).

Source Block:
  - Object: A 2x2 arrangement of contiguous non-white pixels.
  - Properties:
    - Size: Always 2x2.
    - Position: Variable within the input grid.
    - Pixels: Let the colors be A (top-left), B (top-right), C (bottom-left), D (bottom-right).
  - Identification: Locate the unique 2x2 block where all four pixels have color != 0.

Output Grid:
  - Dimensions: Same height and width as the input grid.
  - Background Color: White (0).
  - Content: Four distinct 2x2 monochromatic blocks placed at the absolute corners of the grid.

Corner Blocks (Output):
  - Object: Four 2x2 blocks of solid color.
  - Properties:
    - Size: Always 2x2.
    - Position: Fixed at the grid's absolute corners:
      - Top-Left corner: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
      - Top-Right corner: (0, W-2) to (1, W-1)
      - Bottom-Left corner: (H-2, 0) to (H-1, 1)
      - Bottom-Right corner: (H-2, W-2) to (H-1, W-1) (where H, W are grid dimensions)
    - Color Determination: Derived from the source_block pixels:
      - Top-Left block color: D (source_block's bottom-right pixel)
      - Top-Right block color: C (source_block's bottom-left pixel)
      - Bottom-Left block color: B (source_block's top-right pixel)
      - Bottom-Right block color: A (source_block's top-left pixel)

Action:
  1. Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0).
  2. Find the unique 2x2 source_block of non-white pixels within the input grid. Let its pixel colors be A (TL), B (TR), C (BL), D (BR).
  3. Paint a 2x2 block in the Top-Left corner of the output grid using color D.
  4. Paint a 2x2 block in the Top-Right corner of the output grid using color C.
  5. Paint a 2x2 block in the Bottom-Left corner of the output grid using color B.
  6. Paint a 2x2 block in the Bottom-Right corner of the output grid using color A.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize a new output grid with the same height and width as the input grid, filling all cells with the white color (0).
2.  Scan the input grid to locate the unique 2x2 block where all four cells contain non-white colors. Designate the colors of the cells within this source block as A (top-left), B (top-right), C (bottom-left), and D (bottom-right).
3.  In the output grid, fill the 2x2 area at the absolute top-left corner (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) with color D (the bottom-right color from the source block).
4.  In the output grid, fill the 2x2 area at the absolute top-right corner (rows 0-1, columns W-2 to W-1, where W is the grid width) with color C (the bottom-left color from the source block).
5.  In the output grid, fill the 2x2 area at the absolute bottom-left corner (rows H-2 to H-1, columns 0-1, where H is the grid height) with color B (the top-right color from the source block).
6.  In the output grid, fill the 2x2 area at the absolute bottom-right corner (rows H-2 to H-1, columns W-2 to W-1) with color A (the top-left color from the source block).
7.  Return the modified output grid.
