"""
Transforms the input grid by:
1. Creating an initial output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2. Identifying the unique 2x2 block of non-white pixels (the source_block) in the input grid.
   Let the pixels be A (Top-Left), B (Top-Right), C (Bottom-Left), D (Bottom-Right).
3. Painting four new 2x2 monochromatic blocks onto the output grid at its absolute corners, overwriting existing pixels.
4. The color of each new corner block is determined by the pixel diagonally opposite to its relative corner within the source_block:
   - Top-Left corner block uses the color of the source_block's Bottom-Right pixel (D).
   - Top-Right corner block uses the color of the source_block's Bottom-Left pixel (C).
   - Bottom-Left corner block uses the color of the source_block's Top-Right pixel (B).
   - Bottom-Right corner block uses the color of the source_block's Top-Left pixel (A).
