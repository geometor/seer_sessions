Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the transformation.

**1. General Assessment and Strategy**

*   **Assessment:** The previous code correctly identified the core mechanism: locating a unique 2x2 non-white block (source block) in the input and using its pixel colors to determine the colors of four new 2x2 blocks placed at the absolute corners of the output grid. The color mapping rule (TL=D, TR=C, BL=B, BR=A) appears correct based on the colors generated in the actual outputs matching those in the expected outputs' corners. However, the significant mismatch arises because the previous code generated the output on a *blank white canvas*, whereas the expected outputs clearly show that the original input grid content is *preserved*, and the new corner blocks are *overlaid* or *added* onto it.
*   **Strategy:** The strategy is to modify the transformation logic. Instead of starting with a blank white output grid, the process should begin by creating a *copy* of the input grid. Then, the four 2x2 corner blocks should be painted onto this copied grid, overwriting any existing pixels in those 2x2 corner areas.

**Analysis Interpretation:**

*   **Correction needed:** My manual correction of the "expected" output for Example 1 based on the derived pattern was incorrect according to the analysis script's comparison with the *original* provided expected output. This highlights the importance of sticking to the provided ground truth, even if it seems inconsistent initially. Let's revert to the original "expected" output for Example 1 and re-evaluate.
*   The original `expected` output for Example 1 was: `[[1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0], [6, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`.
*   **Source Block (Ex 1):** Located at (1,1), Colors: A=4(yellow), B=6(magenta), C=2(red), D=1(blue).
*   **Corner Mapping Rule:** TL uses D(blue=1), TR uses C(red=2), BL uses B(magenta=6), BR uses A(yellow=4).
*   **Expected Corner Blocks (Ex 1 - Original):**
    *   TL: Pixel at (0,0) is 1(blue). Seems like only a 1x1 block? Or maybe 2x1? The expected output shows `[[1, 0...], [0, 4...]]`. This doesn't look like a full 2x2 blue block.
    *   TR: Pixels at (0,4), (0,5) are 2(red). Block is `[[..., 2, 2], [..., 0, 0]]`. This is a 1x2 block of red.
    *   BL: Pixels at (3,0), (4,0) are 6(magenta). Block is `[[..., 0, 0], [6, 0...], [6, 0...]]`. This is a 2x1 block of magenta.
    *   BR: Pixels at (3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5) are 4(yellow). Block is `[[..., 4, 4], [..., 4, 4]]`. This is a 2x2 block of yellow.
*   **Corner Mapping Rule (Ex 2 & 3):** The analysis confirms the TL=D, TR=C, BL=B, BR=A rule works perfectly for examples 2 and 3, and the resulting corner blocks are 2x2 and monochromatic.
*   **Preservation:** The analysis confirms that for Examples 2 and 3, the input grid content *is* preserved in the expected output, except where the 2x2 corner blocks overwrite it.
*   **Mismatch Pattern (Ex 2 & 3):** The mismatch analysis confirms that the *only* difference between the expected and actual outputs for Examples 2 and 3 is that the actual output has white pixels where the original input pixels should have been preserved.
*   **Example 1 Anomaly:** Example 1 seems different. The corner "blocks" in the expected output are not uniformly 2x2, and the preservation rule doesn't seem to hold cleanly either. However, the *colors* placed in the corners still follow the A, B, C, D mapping (1=D, 2=C, 6=B, 4=A). The *shape* or *size* of the corner insertions seems variable in Example 1. Could the size/shape of the corner block depend on the corner it's placed in? Or maybe the input grid content near the corner interacts?
    *   TL corner (0,0) area in input: white. Output corner: 1x1 blue.
    *   TR corner (0, W-1) area in input: white. Output corner: 1x2 red.
    *   BL corner (H-1, 0) area in input: white. Output corner: 2x1 magenta.
    *   BR corner (H-1, W-1) area in input: white. Output corner: 2x2 yellow.
    This doesn't reveal an obvious pattern.

*   **Revised Strategy:** The primary transformation seems to be: copy input to output, find the 2x2 source block, paint 2x2 blocks with colors (TL=D, TR=C, BL=B, BR=A) at the absolute corners. This works perfectly for Examples 2 and 3. Example 1 *might* be an outlier or have a subtle secondary rule, *or* the provided expected output for Example 1 in the original prompt description might be flawed. Given the clarity of Examples 2 & 3, the most robust hypothesis is to implement the rule derived from them. If Example 1 fails, it might indicate an edge case or error in the example itself. Let's proceed with the hypothesis derived from Examples 2 & 3.

**3. Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_description: Copies the input grid to the output grid, then identifies a unique 2x2 block of non-white pixels in the input (source_block). It uses the colors of the pixels within this source_block to paint four 2x2 monochromatic blocks at the absolute corners of the output grid, overwriting any existing content in those corner locations.

grid_properties:
  - input_output_shape_match: true # Input and Output grids always have the same dimensions.
  - background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - object: source_block
    description: The single contiguous 2x2 block within the input grid where all four pixels have non-white colors.
    properties:
      - location: Varies per example.
      - size: Always 2x2.
      - pixels: Let top-left be A, top-right B, bottom-left C, bottom-right D.
          - pixel_A_color: color of source_block[0, 0]
          - pixel_B_color: color of source_block[0, 1]
          - pixel_C_color: color of source_block[1, 0]
          - pixel_D_color: color of source_block[1, 1]
  - object: corner_blocks
    description: Four 2x2 monochromatic blocks painted onto the output grid.
    properties:
      - count: 4
      - size: Always 2x2.
      - location: Fixed at the absolute corners of the output grid (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).
      - color_source: Determined by pixels from the input source_block.

actions:
  - action: identify_source_block
    actor: system
    input: input_grid
    output: location and pixel colors (A, B, C, D) of the source_block.
    logic: Find the top-left coordinate (r, c) such that grid[r:r+2, c:c+2] contains no white pixels.
  - action: initialize_output
    actor: system
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    logic: Create a deep copy of the input_grid.
  - action: paint_corner_blocks
    actor: system
    input: output_grid, source_block colors (A, B, C, D)
    output: modified output_grid
    logic:
      - Paint a 2x2 block at the Top-Left corner (0, 0) of output_grid with color D.
      - Paint a 2x2 block at the Top-Right corner (0, W-2) of output_grid with color C.
      - Paint a 2x2 block at the Bottom-Left corner (H-2, 0) of output_grid with color B.
      - Paint a 2x2 block at the Bottom-Right corner (H-2, W-2) of output_grid with color A.
      - These paint actions overwrite existing pixels in the output_grid at the corner locations.

consistency_notes:
  - Examples 2 and 3 follow the described transformation perfectly.
  - Example 1's provided expected output appears inconsistent with the pattern observed in Examples 2 and 3, specifically regarding the shape/size of the corner blocks and the preservation of input content. The color mapping (TL=D, TR=C, BL=B, BR=A) holds for the single corner pixels shown, but the block shapes vary (1x1, 1x2, 2x1, 2x2). The implementation will follow the clearer pattern from Ex 2 & 3.

**4. Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new grid (`output_grid`) that is an exact copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Find the unique 2x2 block in the `input_grid` where all four pixels are non-white (color is not 0). Let this be the `source_block`.
3.  Identify the colors of the four pixels within the `source_block`:
    *   `color_A`: Top-Left pixel of `source_block`.
    *   `color_B`: Top-Right pixel of `source_block`.
    *   `color_C`: Bottom-Left pixel of `source_block`.
    *   `color_D`: Bottom-Right pixel of `source_block`.
4.  Determine the dimensions of the `output_grid`: height `H` and width `W`.
5.  Modify the `output_grid` by painting four monochromatic 2x2 blocks at its absolute corners:
    *   Paint a 2x2 block at the Top-Left corner (coordinates [0:2, 0:2]) with `color_D`.
    *   Paint a 2x2 block at the Top-Right corner (coordinates [0:2, W-2:W]) with `color_C`.
    *   Paint a 2x2 block at the Bottom-Left corner (coordinates [H-2:H, 0:2]) with `color_B`.
    *   Paint a 2x2 block at the Bottom-Right corner (coordinates [H-2:H, W-2:W]) with `color_A`.
6.  Return the modified `output_grid`.
