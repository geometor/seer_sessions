task_description: Place four new 2x2 colored blocks around an existing 2x2 block, where the color and position of the new blocks depend on the colors and position of the original block's pixels.

input_features:
  grid_size: [6, 6]
  background_color: 0 # white
  objects:
    - count: 1
      type: block
      shape: [2, 2]
      properties:
        pixels: contiguous, non-white
        location: variable within the grid
        colors: A (top-left), B (top-right), C (bottom-left), D (bottom-right)
        top_left_coord: (r, c)

output_features:
  grid_size: [6, 6]
  background_color: 0 # white
  objects:
    - count: 5 # Original + 4 new
      # Original Object
      original_object:
        type: block
        shape: [2, 2]
        properties:
          pixels: same as input A, B, C, D
          location: same as input (r, c) to (r+1, c+1)
      # New Objects
      new_objects:
        - count: 4
          type: block
          shape: [2, 2]
          properties:
            pixels: monochromatic (single color per block)
            placement: Relative to the original block (r, c)
            configurations:
              - object: Top-Left New Block
                color: D (from input bottom-right pixel)
                top_left_coord: (r-1, c-1)
              - object: Top-Right New Block
                color: C (from input bottom-left pixel)
                top_left_coord: (r-1, c+2)
              - object: Bottom-Left New Block
                color: B (from input top-right pixel)
                top_left_coord: (r+2, c-1)
              - object: Bottom-Right New Block
                color: A (from input top-left pixel)
                top_left_coord: (r+2, c+2)

relationships:
  - The colors of the four new blocks are determined by the diagonally opposite pixels within the original 2x2 block.
  - The positions of the four new blocks are fixed relative to the position of the original 2x2 block.

assumptions:
  - Input always contains exactly one 2x2 non-white block.
  - The 2x2 block is positioned such that the new blocks fit entirely within the 6x6 grid boundaries.
