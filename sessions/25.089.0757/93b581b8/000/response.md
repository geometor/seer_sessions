Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** Each input grid is 6x6 and predominantly white (color 0). It contains a single, isolated 2x2 block composed of four potentially different non-white pixels.
2.  **Output Grid:** Each output grid is also 6x6. It contains the original 2x2 block from the input in the same location. Additionally, it features four new 2x2 blocks.
3.  **New Objects:** The four new 2x2 blocks are placed symmetrically around the original block, resembling corner reflections or expansions. Each new 2x2 block is filled entirely with a single color.
4.  **Color Relationship:** The color used for each new 2x2 block corresponds to one of the colors from the *original* 2x2 block. Specifically:
    *   If the original block's colors are A (top-left), B (top-right), C (bottom-left), D (bottom-right):
    *   The new top-left 2x2 block uses color D.
    *   The new top-right 2x2 block uses color C.
    *   The new bottom-left 2x2 block uses color B.
    *   The new bottom-right 2x2 block uses color A.
5.  **Positional Relationship:** Let the top-left corner of the original 2x2 block be at row `r`, column `c`.
    *   The original block occupies `(r, c)` to `(r+1, c+1)`.
    *   The new top-left 2x2 block (color D) occupies `(r-1, c-1)` to `(r, c)`.
    *   The new top-right 2x2 block (color C) occupies `(r-1, c+2)` to `(r, c+3)`.
    *   The new bottom-left 2x2 block (color B) occupies `(r+2, c-1)` to `(r+3, c)`.
    *   The new bottom-right 2x2 block (color A) occupies `(r+2, c+2)` to `(r+3, c+3)`.
    *   There is a one-pixel white gap horizontally and vertically between the original block and the centers of the new blocks.

task_description: Place four new 2x2 colored blocks around an existing 2x2 block, where the color and position of the new blocks depend on the colors and position of the original block's pixels.

        properties:
          pixels: same as input A, B, C, D

          properties:
            pixels: monochromatic (single color per block)
            placement: Relative to the original block (r, c)
            configurations:
              - object: Top-Left New Block
                color: D (from input bottom-right pixel)
                top_left_coord: (r-1, c-1)
              - object: Top-Right New Block
                color: C (from input bottom-left pixel)
                top_left_coord: (r-1, c+2)
              - object: Bottom-Left New Block
                color: B (from input top-right pixel)
                top_left_coord: (r+2, c-1)
              - object: Bottom-Right New Block
                color: A (from input top-left pixel)
                top_left_coord: (r+2, c+2)

relationships:
  - The colors of the four new blocks are determined by the diagonally opposite pixels within the original 2x2 block.
  - The positions of the four new blocks are fixed relative to the position of the original 2x2 block.

assumptions:
  - Input always contains exactly one 2x2 non-white block.
  - The 2x2 block is positioned such that the new blocks fit entirely within the 6x6 grid boundaries.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Locate the 2x2 block of non-white pixels in the input grid.
3.  Identify the coordinates `(r, c)` of the top-left pixel of this block.
4.  Identify the colors of the four pixels within this block: `A` at `(r, c)`, `B` at `(r, c+1)`, `C` at `(r+1, c)`, and `D` at `(r+1, c+1)`.
5.  Define the locations and colors for four new 2x2 blocks:
    *   **Top-Left New Block:** Color `D`, starting at `(r-1, c-1)`.
    *   **Top-Right New Block:** Color `C`, starting at `(r-1, c+2)`.
    *   **Bottom-Left New Block:** Color `B`, starting at `(r+2, c-1)`.
    *   **Bottom-Right New Block:** Color `A`, starting at `(r+2, c+2)`.
6.  For each new block defined in step 5, fill the corresponding 2x2 area in the output grid with its specified color.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
