It contains a single, isolated 2x2 block composed of four potentially different non-white pixels.\n2.  **Output Grid:** Each output grid is also 6x6. It contains the original 2x2 block from the input in the same location. Additionally, it features four new 2x2 blocks.\n3.  **New Objects:** The four new 2x2 blocks are placed symmetrically around the original block, resembling corner reflections or expansions. Each new 2x2 block is filled entirely with a single color.\n4.  **Color Relationship:** The color used for each new 2x2 block corresponds to one of the colors from the *original* 2x2 block. Specifically:\n    *   If the original block's colors are A (top-left), B (top-right), C (bottom-left), D (bottom-right):\n    *   The new top-left 2x2 block uses color D.\n    *   The new top-right 2x2 block uses color C.\n    *   The new bottom-left 2x2 block uses color B.\n    *   The new bottom-right 2x2 block uses color A.\n5.  **Positional Relationship:** Let the top-left corner of the original 2x2 block be at row `r`, column `c`.\n    *   The original block occupies `(r, c)` to `(r+1, c+1)`.\n    *   The new top-left 2x2 block (color D) occupies `(r-1, c-1)` to `(r, c)`.\n    *   The new top-right 2x2 block (color C) occupies `(r-1, c+2)` to `(r, c+3)`.\n    *   The new bottom-left 2x2 block (color B) occupies `(r+2, c-1)` to `(r+3, c)`.\n    *   The new bottom-right 2x2 block (color A) occupies `(r+2, c+2)` to `(r+3, c+3)`.\n    *   There is a one-pixel white gap horizontally and vertically between the original block and the centers of the new blocks.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
