task_description: Place four new 2x2 blocks at the corners of the grid, based on the colors of an existing central 2x2 block.

grid_properties:
  - All examples use 6x6 grids.
  - Input grids contain a background of white (0).
  - Each input grid has exactly one 2x2 block composed entirely of non-white pixels.

objects:
  - type: block
    name: source_block
    description: A 2x2 block of non-white pixels present in the input grid.
    properties:
      - location: Varies, identified by its top-left corner (r, c).
      - pixels: [A (r,c), B (r,c+1), C (r+1,c), D (r+1,c+1)] where A, B, C, D are non-white colors.
      - persistence: This block remains unchanged in the output grid.
  - type: block
    name: corner_blocks
    description: Four new 2x2 monochromatic blocks added to the output grid.
    properties:
      - count: 4
      - size: 2x2
      - location: Fixed positions at the corners of the grid.
        - Top-Left (TL): Top-left coordinate at (0, 0).
        - Top-Right (TR): Top-left coordinate at (0, grid_width - 2).
        - Bottom-Left (BL): Top-left coordinate at (grid_height - 2, 0).
        - Bottom-Right (BR): Top-left coordinate at (grid_height - 2, grid_width - 2).
      - color_determination: Based on the colors of the source_block.
        - TL block color: D (source_block bottom-right pixel)
        - TR block color: C (source_block bottom-left pixel)
        - BL block color: B (source_block top-right pixel)
        - BR block color: A (source_block top-left pixel)

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: source_block
    details: Find the top-left coordinate (r, c) of the 2x2 non-white block in the input grid.
  - action: copy
    target: input_grid
    details: Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - action: determine_colors
    input: source_block colors (A, B, C, D)
    output: colors for the four corner_blocks (D, C, B, A respectively for TL, TR, BL, BR).
  - action: paint
    target: output_grid
    details: Paint the four 2x2 corner_blocks onto the output grid at their fixed corner locations using the determined colors.

inconsistencies:
  - Example 1's expected output shows partially painted TR and BR corner blocks (only the top row for TR, only the top row for BR). Examples 2 and 3 show full 2x2 corner blocks. Assuming the rule is to paint full 2x2 blocks and Example 1 might be anomalous or have a display error in the provided expected output. The core logic derived from Examples 2 & 3 seems more robust.
