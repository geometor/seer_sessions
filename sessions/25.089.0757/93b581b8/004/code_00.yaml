Task: Place colored blocks in corners based on a source block.

Input Grid:
  - Contains a single 2x2 block of non-white pixels (source_block) surrounded by white pixels.
  - Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 6x6 in examples).
  - Background Color: White (0).

Source Block:
  - Object: A 2x2 arrangement of contiguous non-white pixels.
  - Properties:
    - Size: Always 2x2.
    - Position: Variable within the input grid.
    - Pixels: Let the colors be A (top-left), B (top-right), C (bottom-left), D (bottom-right).
  - Identification: Locate the unique 2x2 block where all four pixels have color != 0.

Output Grid:
  - Dimensions: Same height and width as the input grid.
  - Background Color: White (0).
  - Content: Four distinct 2x2 monochromatic blocks placed at the absolute corners of the grid.

Corner Blocks (Output):
  - Object: Four 2x2 blocks of solid color.
  - Properties:
    - Size: Always 2x2.
    - Position: Fixed at the grid's absolute corners:
      - Top-Left corner: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
      - Top-Right corner: (0, W-2) to (1, W-1)
      - Bottom-Left corner: (H-2, 0) to (H-1, 1)
      - Bottom-Right corner: (H-2, W-2) to (H-1, W-1) (where H, W are grid dimensions)
    - Color Determination: Derived from the source_block pixels:
      - Top-Left block color: D (source_block's bottom-right pixel)
      - Top-Right block color: C (source_block's bottom-left pixel)
      - Bottom-Left block color: B (source_block's top-right pixel)
      - Bottom-Right block color: A (source_block's top-left pixel)

Action:
  1. Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0).
  2. Find the unique 2x2 source_block of non-white pixels within the input grid. Let its pixel colors be A (TL), B (TR), C (BL), D (BR).
  3. Paint a 2x2 block in the Top-Left corner of the output grid using color D.
  4. Paint a 2x2 block in the Top-Right corner of the output grid using color C.
  5. Paint a 2x2 block in the Bottom-Left corner of the output grid using color B.
  6. Paint a 2x2 block in the Bottom-Right corner of the output grid using color A.
