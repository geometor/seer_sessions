            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided code correctly identifies the 2x2 non-white source block and determines the colors for the four corner blocks based on the pixels diagonally opposite within the source block. It successfully transforms Examples 2 and 3.\n\nHowever, the code fails on Example 1. The failure occurs because the code copies the entire input grid to the output grid *before* painting the corner blocks. In Example 1, the source block is located near the top-left, causing the painting of the new top-left corner block (using color D=1) and the top-right corner block (using color C=2) to overwrite parts of the original source block (colors 4, 6, 2, 1) that were copied initially.\n\nThe expected output for Example 1, along with the successful transformations in Examples 2 and 3, indicates that the output grid should start as a blank (white) canvas of the same dimensions as the input. The only colored pixels in the output should be the four 2x2 corner blocks derived from the input's source block. The original source block itself, and any other non-white pixels from the input, are *not* transferred to the output.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Modify the transformation logic to initialize the output grid as entirely white (filled with 0s) instead of copying the input.\n2.  Keep the logic for finding the source 2x2 block in the input.\n3.  Keep the logic for determining the colors for the four corner blocks based on the diagonally opposite pixels in the source block.\n4.  Paint these four 2x2 corner blocks onto the initially white output grid.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's gather metrics on the source block identified in each input example.\n\n"
