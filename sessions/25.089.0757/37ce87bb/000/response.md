**Perception of the Elements**

1.  **Grid Background**: The grids primarily consist of an orange (7) background.
2.  **Input Objects**: The input grids contain objects composed of azure (8) and sometimes red (2) pixels. These objects often appear as vertical lines or segments.
3.  **Transformation**: The transformation involves adding a new vertical segment of gray (5) pixels to the grid. The input objects (azure and red) remain unchanged in the output.
4.  **Gray Segment Location**:
    *   The *column* where the gray segment appears is determined by the rightmost extent of any non-background object in the input. Specifically, it's two columns to the right of the rightmost non-background pixel.
    *   The *rows* spanned by the gray segment depend on the vertical extent and colors of the input objects. The segment always ends at the row index corresponding to the lowest non-background pixel in the input. The starting row depends on the relative vertical positions of the highest azure and red pixels, and whether red pixels exist at all.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Background:
  - color: orange (7)
Input_Objects:
  - type: colored pixels/segments
  - colors: [azure (8), red (2)]
  - properties:
      - vertical extent (min_row, max_row)
      - horizontal extent (min_col, max_col)
Output_Objects:
  - type: original input objects + new gray segment
  - colors: [azure (8), red (2), gray (5)]
Transformation:
  - action: add_vertical_segment
  - color_added: gray (5)
  - location_rule:
      - column: Determined by the maximum column index (`max_c`) of any non-orange pixel in the input. `gray_column = max_c + 2`.
      - rows: Determined by the vertical extent and colors of non-orange pixels.
          - end_row: The maximum row index (`max_r`) of any non-orange pixel in the input.
          - start_row: Dependent on the presence and relative vertical position of red (2) and azure (8) pixels:
              - If no red pixels: Start at row index 1.
              - If red pixels exist:
                  - Find the minimum row index of azure pixels (`min_r_azure`).
                  - Find the minimum row index of red pixels (`min_r_red`).
                  - If azure starts higher (`min_r_azure < min_r_red`): Start at `end_row`.
                  - If red starts higher or at the same row (`min_r_red <= min_r_azure`): Start at `min_r_red + 2`.
Relationships:
  - The position and extent of the added gray segment are directly derived from the spatial properties (max row, max column, min row of specific colors) of the existing non-background objects in the input grid.
  - The background color (orange) remains unchanged unless overwritten by the new gray segment.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not the background color (orange, 7). If there are no such pixels, the output is identical to the input.
2.  Determine the maximum column index (`max_c`) and maximum row index (`max_r`) among all these non-background pixels.
3.  Calculate the target column for the new gray segment: `gray_c = max_c + 2`.
4.  Set the ending row for the gray segment: `R_end = max_r`.
5.  Determine the starting row (`R_start`) for the gray segment based on the colors present:
    a.  Check if any red (2) pixels exist in the input grid.
    b.  If NO red pixels exist: Set `R_start = 1`. (Using 1-based index for start, assuming grid rows start visually from 1, corresponding to index 1 if the top row index 0 is background only). If the grid has only one row, R_start = 0. Let's refine: Set `R_start_idx = 1`.
    c.  If red pixels EXIST:
        i.  Find the minimum row index of any azure (8) pixel (`min_r_azure_idx`). If no azure pixels exist, consider this value to be effectively infinite (or larger than any possible row index).
        ii. Find the minimum row index of any red (2) pixel (`min_r_red_idx`).
        iii. If `min_r_azure_idx < min_r_red_idx` (the highest azure pixel is above the highest red pixel): Set `R_start_idx = R_end`.
        iv. Else (if `min_r_red_idx <= min_r_azure_idx`): Set `R_start_idx = min_r_red_idx +
