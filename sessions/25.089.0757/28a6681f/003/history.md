```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by changing sequences of white pixels (0) 
    located horizontally between two non-white pixels to blue pixels (1).

    The transformation rule is applied row by row. For each row:
    1. Identify the column indices of all non-white pixels (pixels with value != 0). 
       These act as potential horizontal boundaries.
    2. Consider consecutive pairs of these boundary indices (left_c, right_c).
    3. If there is at least one pixel between these boundaries (i.e., right_c > left_c + 1) 
       and all pixels strictly between these boundaries (columns > left_c and < right_c) 
       in the input grid are white (0), change all these white pixels to blue (1)
       in the output grid.
    4. Pixels that are not part of such identified white segments between non-white
       boundaries remain unchanged from the input grid.
