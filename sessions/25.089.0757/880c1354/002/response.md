## General Assessment

The previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying the connected components (blobs) originating from the four corners and swapping them diagonally (TL<->BR, TR<->BL), changing the color of the swapped blob to match the original color of the corner it was swapped *from*.

The execution results show this assumption was incorrect. The transformed outputs do not match the expected outputs, indicating the swap logic or the color assignment rule is wrong.

Specifically:
1.  **Incorrect Swap Pattern:** The examples suggest the movement or color assignment isn't a simple diagonal swap. The destination location for a color or blob seems to follow a different pattern, potentially conditional.
2.  **Incorrect Color Assignment:** The color assigned to a corner blob's location in the output does not consistently match the color of the diagonally opposite corner's original blob.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Re-analyze Mappings:** Carefully examine the relationship between the input corner colors/blobs and the output corner colors/blobs across all three examples. Identify the source color for each corner location in the output.
2.  **Identify Controlling Factors:** Determine what factors influence the mapping (e.g., corner color values, equality between corner colors, shape properties).
3.  **Formulate Conditional Rule:** Develop a precise rule, potentially with conditions, that explains how the color of the blob at each corner location is determined in the output based on the input corner colors and shapes.
4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect this new, more accurate rule.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze the corner colors and shapes for each example. We need the `find_connected_component` function.
