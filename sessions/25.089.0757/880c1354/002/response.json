            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying the connected components (blobs) originating from the four corners and swapping them diagonally (TL<->BR, TR<->BL), changing the color of the swapped blob to match the original color of the corner it was swapped *from*.\n\nThe execution results show this assumption was incorrect. The transformed outputs do not match the expected outputs, indicating the swap logic or the color assignment rule is wrong.\n\nSpecifically:\n1.  **Incorrect Swap Pattern:** The examples suggest the movement or color assignment isn't a simple diagonal swap. The destination location for a color or blob seems to follow a different pattern, potentially conditional.\n2.  **Incorrect Color Assignment:** The color assigned to a corner blob's location in the output does not consistently match the color of the diagonally opposite corner's original blob.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Re-analyze Mappings:** Carefully examine the relationship between the input corner colors/blobs and the output corner colors/blobs across all three examples. Identify the source color for each corner location in the output.\n2.  **Identify Controlling Factors:** Determine what factors influence the mapping (e.g., corner color values, equality between corner colors, shape properties).\n3.  **Formulate Conditional Rule:** Develop a precise rule, potentially with conditions, that explains how the color of the blob at each corner location is determined in the output based on the input corner colors and shapes.\n4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect this new, more accurate rule.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the corner colors and shapes for each example. We need the `find_connected_component` function.\n\n"
