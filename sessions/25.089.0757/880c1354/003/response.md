"""
The transformation identifies the connected color blobs originating from the four corners
of the input grid. It then recolors the pixels belonging to each of these original corner
blobs. The new color applied to a blob's pixels is the original color found at the corner
located clockwise relative to the blob's origin corner. Specifically:
- Pixels originally part of the Top-Left (TL) corner blob are recolored with the original Bottom-Left (BL) corner color.
- Pixels originally part of the Top-Right (TR) corner blob are recolored with the original Top-Left (TL) corner color.
- Pixels originally part of the Bottom-Right (BR) corner blob are recolored with the original Top-Right (TR) corner color.
- Pixels originally part of the Bottom-Left (BL) corner blob are recolored with the original Bottom-Right (BR) corner color.
Pixels that do not belong to any of these four initial corner blobs retain their original color.
