Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input is always a 3x3 grid.
2.  **Output Grid:** The output is always a 9x9 grid.
3.  **Colors:** The input grid contains mostly white (0) pixels and exactly one non-white pixel. The color of this single pixel varies across examples (yellow=4, gray=5, green=3, azure=8, orange=7). The output grid uses only two colors: white (0) and the non-white color from the input grid.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve interpreting the *value* of the non-white input pixel as a *digit*. The output grid then visually represents this digit on a larger scale (9x9). The specific non-white color from the input is used as the "ink" to draw the digit shape on the white background of the output grid.
5.  **Pattern Recognition:** The patterns in the output grids clearly resemble the digits 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8, corresponding directly to the input color values 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 respectively. The 9x9 pixel patterns for these digits appear to be fixed templates.
6.  **Input Position Irrelevance:** The position of the non-white pixel within the 3x3 input grid does not seem to affect the output pattern, only its color value matters.

  - step: 3
    action: "Select Template"
    details: "Choose the predefined 9x9 pixel template corresponding to the digit represented by the value C."
  - step: 4
    action: "Generate Output"
    details: "Create a 9x9 grid based on the selected template, using color C for the digit's pixels and white (0) for the background pixels."
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Examine the input 3x3 grid.
2.  Find the single pixel whose color is not white (0). Record its color value, let's call it `digit_color`.
3.  Determine the digit represented by `digit_color` (e.g., if the color is 4, the digit is 4).
4.  Retrieve a predefined 9x9 pixel template pattern associated with this digit.
5.  Create a new 9x9 output grid.
6.  Fill the output grid according to the retrieved template: use `digit_color` for the pixels forming the digit shape and white (0) for all other background pixels.
7.  Return the generated 9x9 grid.
