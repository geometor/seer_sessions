transformation_logic:
  - step: 1
    action: "Identify"
    details: "Locate the single non-white pixel in the 3x3 input grid."
  - step: 2
    action: "Extract"
    details: "Get the color value (C) of the identified pixel."
  - step: 3
    action: "Select Template"
    details: "Choose the predefined 9x9 pixel template corresponding to the digit represented by the value C."
  - step: 4
    action: "Generate Output"
    details: "Create a 9x9 grid based on the selected template, using color C for the digit's pixels and white (0) for the background pixels."
