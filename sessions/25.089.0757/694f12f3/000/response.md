Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The input grids contain a white background (color 0) and one or more solid rectangular objects made of yellow pixels (color 4). The output grids maintain the overall structure, background, and the borders of the yellow rectangles. The key transformation happens *inside* these yellow rectangles. The interior pixels of the yellow rectangles change color, becoming either red (color 2) or blue (color 1). The specific color assigned to the interior seems to depend on a comparison between the rectangles present in the input. In both examples, there are two yellow rectangles. The one with the larger *interior area* (the number of pixels not on the border) has its interior changed to red (2), while the one with the smaller interior area has its interior changed to blue (1).

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Modifies the interior color of yellow rectangles based on their relative interior size.
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: rectangle
    color: 4 (yellow)
    properties:
      - solid_fill
      - axis_aligned
      - minimum_size_for_interior: 3x3 # Rectangles smaller than this have no interior
transformation:
  - action: identify_objects
    target: yellow rectangles (color 4)
  - action: determine_interior
    input: each yellow rectangle
    definition: Pixels within the rectangle not adjacent (cardinally) to the background (color 0) or grid edge. Equivalently, yellow pixels whose 4 cardinal neighbors are also yellow.
    output: set of interior pixel coordinates for each rectangle
  - action: calculate_area
    input: interior pixel sets
    output: interior area (pixel count) for each rectangle
  - action: compare_areas
    input: interior areas of all yellow rectangles
    condition: Assumes two rectangles with different interior areas based on examples.
    output: identification of the rectangle with the largest interior area and the one with the smallest.
  - action: color_change
    target: interior pixels of the rectangle with the largest interior area
    new_color: 2 (red)
  - action: color_change
    target: interior pixels of the rectangle with the smallest interior area
    new_color: 1 (blue)
  - action: preserve
    target:
      - background pixels (color 0)
      - border pixels of yellow rectangles (color 4) # Yellow pixels adjacent to non-yellow pixels or grid edges.
relationships:
  - The new interior color (red or blue) depends on the relative ranking of the rectangle's interior area compared to other yellow rectangles in the input grid. Larger interior area maps to red, smaller maps to blue.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify all distinct, solid, yellow (4) rectangular objects in the input grid.
3.  For each identified yellow rectangle:
    a.  Determine the set of its interior pixels. An interior pixel is a yellow pixel that is surrounded on all four cardinal sides (up, down, left, right) by other yellow pixels belonging to the same rectangle.
    b.  Calculate the area (count of pixels) of this interior set. Store the rectangle identifier, its interior pixel coordinates, and its interior area.
4.  Compare the calculated interior areas of all identified yellow rectangles.
5.  Find the rectangle with the largest interior area. Change the color of its corresponding interior pixels in the output grid to red (2).
6.  Find the rectangle with the smallest interior area. Change the color of its corresponding interior pixels in the output grid to blue (1).
7.  Leave all other pixels (background and the yellow borders of the rectangles) unchanged in the output grid.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
