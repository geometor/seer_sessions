The output grids maintain the overall structure, background, and the borders of the yellow rectangles. The key transformation happens *inside* these yellow rectangles. The interior pixels of the yellow rectangles change color, becoming either red (color 2) or blue (color 1). The specific color assigned to the interior seems to depend on a comparison between the rectangles present in the input. In both examples, there are two yellow rectangles. The one with the larger *interior area* (the number of pixels not on the border) has its interior changed to red (2), while the one with the smaller interior area has its interior changed to blue (1).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
