task_description: Modifies the interior color of yellow rectangles based on their relative interior size.
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: rectangle
    color: 4 (yellow)
    properties:
      - solid_fill
      - axis_aligned
      - minimum_size_for_interior: 3x3 # Rectangles smaller than this have no interior
transformation:
  - action: identify_objects
    target: yellow rectangles (color 4)
  - action: determine_interior
    input: each yellow rectangle
    definition: Pixels within the rectangle not adjacent (cardinally) to the background (color 0) or grid edge. Equivalently, yellow pixels whose 4 cardinal neighbors are also yellow.
    output: set of interior pixel coordinates for each rectangle
  - action: calculate_area
    input: interior pixel sets
    output: interior area (pixel count) for each rectangle
  - action: compare_areas
    input: interior areas of all yellow rectangles
    condition: Assumes two rectangles with different interior areas based on examples.
    output: identification of the rectangle with the largest interior area and the one with the smallest.
  - action: color_change
    target: interior pixels of the rectangle with the largest interior area
    new_color: 2 (red)
  - action: color_change
    target: interior pixels of the rectangle with the smallest interior area
    new_color: 1 (blue)
  - action: preserve
    target:
      - background pixels (color 0)
      - border pixels of yellow rectangles (color 4) # Yellow pixels adjacent to non-yellow pixels or grid edges.
relationships:
  - The new interior color (red or blue) depends on the relative ranking of the rectangle's interior area compared to other yellow rectangles in the input grid. Larger interior area maps to red, smaller maps to blue.
