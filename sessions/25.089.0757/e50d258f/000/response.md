*   **Perception:** The input grids contain multiple distinct "objects" or patterns, typically formed by non-white (non-zero) pixels and separated by white (zero) pixels. The output grid is always a smaller subgrid extracted directly from the input grid. The key task is to identify which specific subgrid from the input corresponds to the output. By comparing the input and output examples, it appears the output corresponds to the bounding box of a specific object within the input. This object seems to be consistently identifiable by containing the highest count of red (2) pixels compared to other distinct objects in the input grid.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - Input Grid: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 8 (azure).
      - Output Grid: A smaller 2D array of pixels, a subgrid of the input, containing colors 1 (blue), 2 (red), 8 (azure).
      - Objects: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels within the input grid, separated by white pixels.
    transformation:
      - identification: Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels.
      - selection_criterion: Count the number of red (2) pixels within each identified object.
      - target_object: Select the object that has the maximum count of red pixels.
      - extraction: Determine the minimal bounding box that encloses the selected target object.
      - result: The output grid is the subgrid extracted from the input using this bounding box.
    relationships:
      - The output grid is a sub-section of the input grid.
      - The specific sub-section is defined by the bounding box of the object containing the most red pixels.
      - White pixels (0) act as separators between objects and are excluded from the bounding box calculation and the final output (unless they fall within the bounding box of the target object, which doesn't happen in the examples but is possible if the object has internal 'holes' of white).
    ambiguities:
      - The behavior in case of a tie (multiple objects with the same maximum count of red pixels) is not defined by the examples. Assumed behavior might be to select the topmost, then leftmost object among the ties.
      - The behavior if no red pixels are present in any object is not defined.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct contiguous groups (objects) of non-white (color value > 0) pixels. Treat diagonally adjacent pixels of the same object as connected.
    2.  For each identified object, count the total number of red (color 2) pixels it contains.
    3.  Find the object that has the highest count of red pixels. (If multiple objects share the highest count, select the one whose topmost pixel is highest, and among those, the one whose leftmost pixel is furthest left).
    4.  Determine the coordinates of the minimal rectangular bounding box that fully encloses all pixels belonging to the selected object.
    5.  Extract the subgrid from the input grid corresponding to this bounding box. This subgrid is the output.
