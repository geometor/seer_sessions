The output grid is always a smaller subgrid extracted directly from the input grid. The key task is to identify which specific subgrid from the input corresponds to the output. By comparing the input and output examples, it appears the output corresponds to the bounding box of a specific object within the input. This object seems to be consistently identifiable by containing the highest count of red (2) pixels compared to other distinct objects in the input grid.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
