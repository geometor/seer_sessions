2. Isolate the portion of the grid located below this gray line.
3. Within this lower portion, count the total number of red pixels (color 2) and the total number of yellow pixels (color 4).
4. Compare these two counts. Identify which color (red or yellow) has a higher count in the lower portion.
5. Construct a new 2x2 grid. Fill every cell of this 2x2 grid with the color identified in the previous step (the one with the higher count below the gray line). This 2x2 grid is the output.
