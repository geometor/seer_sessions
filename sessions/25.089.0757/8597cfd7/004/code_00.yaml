Task: Compare pixel counts above and below a dividing line to determine output color.

Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Contains pixels of various colors (0-9).
    - Features a single horizontal line composed entirely of gray (5) pixels. This line divides the grid into an upper region and a lower region.
    - Contains red (2) and yellow (4) pixels in both the upper and lower regions.
    - Other colors, like white (0), act as background.

Objects:
  - Gray_Line:
    - Type: Horizontal Line
    - Color: Gray (5)
    - Function: Acts as a separator between the upper and lower counting regions.
  - Upper_Region:
    - Location: Rows above the Gray_Line.
    - Contents: Contains red and yellow pixels, among others.
  - Lower_Region:
    - Location: Rows below the Gray_Line.
    - Contents: Contains red and yellow pixels, among others.
  - Red_Pixels: Color 2.
  - Yellow_Pixels: Color 4.

Actions:
  1. Identify: Locate the horizontal Gray_Line.
  2. Define_Regions: Establish the Upper_Region and Lower_Region based on the Gray_Line's position.
  3. Count_Pixels:
     - Count red pixels in Upper_Region (R_above).
     - Count yellow pixels in Upper_Region (Y_above).
     - Count red pixels in Lower_Region (R_below).
     - Count yellow pixels in Lower_Region (Y_below).
  4. Compare_Counts: Evaluate counts based on a specific rule involving both regions.
     - Determine the 'winning' color (Red or Yellow) based on the comparison.
  5. Generate_Output: Create a 2x2 grid filled entirely with the determined winning color.

Comparison_Rule_Details: (Derived from analysis)
  - Primary_Output: Red (2)
  - Condition_for_Yellow_Output (4):
    - Condition 1: Yellow count must be strictly greater than Red count in the Upper_Region (Y_above > R_above).
    - Condition 2: Yellow count must be strictly greater than Red count in the Lower_Region (Y_below > R_below).
    - Condition 3: The difference between Yellow and Red counts in the Lower_Region must be greater than or equal to the difference in the Upper_Region ((Y_below - R_below) >= (Y_above - R_above)).
  - If all three conditions are met, the output color is Yellow (4). Otherwise, it is Red (2).

Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Size: 2x2.
    - Content: Uniformly filled with the single winning color (Red or Yellow).
