This is the 'winning' color.\n      - Step 7: Generate a 2x2 grid filled entirely with the winning color.\n\n    Relationships:\n      - The gray line's position defines the boundary for counting.\n      - The output color is determined solely by the comparison of red and yellow pixel counts *below* the gray line. The counts *above* the line are irrelevant.\n      - The output size (2x2) is fixed and independent of the input grid dimensions or content, other than the winning color.\n    ```"
