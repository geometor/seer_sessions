task_description: Transforms an input grid row by row based on whether a row contains repeated colors or contributes to a global pattern.
background_color:
  - Gray (7) is the visually predominant background color in all examples.
  - Determination: Can be assumed as 7 or potentially the most frequent color globally, although caution is needed if other colors are very frequent (like white(0) in Ex3 input).
objects:
  - Pixels: Individual cells with a color value (0-9).
  - Rows: Horizontal lines of pixels in the grid.
  - Pattern Pixels: Non-background pixels located in 'pattern rows'.
  - Fill Color Pixels: Non-background pixels that appear >= 2 times within a single row.
row_classification:
  - criterion: Examine each row independently.
  - type_fill: A row is a "fill row" if it contains two or more pixels of the same non-background color.
  - type_pattern: A row is a "pattern row" if it is not a "fill row".
pattern_template:
  - scope: Global, one template derived for the entire grid.
  - derivation:
      1. Start with a row of background color pixels, matching the grid width.
      2. Identify all "pattern rows" in the input grid.
      3. Collect the position (column index) and color of every non-background pixel found within these "pattern rows".
      4. Place these collected colors into their corresponding column indices in the template row. (Assumption: No column conflicts seen in examples, simple overwrite is sufficient if they occurred).
  - content: The resulting row containing background pixels interspersed with the pattern pixels.
output_grid_construction:
  - dimensions: Same height and width as the input grid.
  - row_population:
      - Iterate through each row index (0 to height-1).
      - If the input row at this index was classified as a "fill row":
          - Find the non-background color that appeared >= 2 times in that input row.
          - Fill the entire corresponding output row with that single color.
      - If the input row at this index was classified as a "pattern row":
          - Copy the globally derived "pattern template row" into the corresponding output row.
