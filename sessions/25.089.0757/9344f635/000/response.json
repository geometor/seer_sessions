            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation process for these examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 2D grids of varying sizes (8x8, 7x7, 9x9).\n2.  **Colors:** Multiple colors are used. Gray (7) appears to be the primary background color in most cases. Other colors like maroon (9), gray (5), yellow (4), magenta (6), red (2), blue (1), white (0), and green (3) appear as foreground elements or objects.\n3.  **Objects:** The non-background colors form small objects, often single pixels or pairs of adjacent pixels within a row.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to operate row by row, but the logic depends on the content of the input row and sometimes incorporates information from other rows. Two distinct types of row transformations occur:\n    *   **Row Filling:** Some input rows trigger their corresponding output row to be completely filled with a single color.\n    *   **Pattern Application:** Other input rows result in an output row that follows a specific pattern derived from elements across multiple input rows, overlaid on the background color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
