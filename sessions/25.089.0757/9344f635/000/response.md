Okay, let's break down the transformation process for these examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 2D grids of varying sizes (8x8, 7x7, 9x9).
2.  **Colors:** Multiple colors are used. Gray (7) appears to be the primary background color in most cases. Other colors like maroon (9), gray (5), yellow (4), magenta (6), red (2), blue (1), white (0), and green (3) appear as foreground elements or objects.
3.  **Objects:** The non-background colors form small objects, often single pixels or pairs of adjacent pixels within a row.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to operate row by row, but the logic depends on the content of the input row and sometimes incorporates information from other rows. Two distinct types of row transformations occur:
    *   **Row Filling:** Some input rows trigger their corresponding output row to be completely filled with a single color.
    *   **Pattern Application:** Other input rows result in an output row that follows a specific pattern derived from elements across multiple input rows, overlaid on the background color.

**YAML Facts:**

rule_logic:
  - step: Identify background color (assumed to be 7/gray).
  - step: Determine row action type by analyzing non-background colors in each input row.
    - condition: If a row contains >= 2 pixels of the *same* non-background color C.
      - action: Mark row as "fill" type with color C.
    - condition: Otherwise.
      - action: Mark row as "pattern" type.
  - step: Define the pattern for "pattern" rows.
    - source: Collect all non-background pixels (color, column) from all input rows marked as "pattern" type.
    - result: Create a template row (width of the grid, filled with background color 7) and place each unique collected pixel's color at its specified column.
  - step: Construct the output grid.
    - For each row marked "fill": Fill the output row completely with the determined fill color C.
    - For each row marked "pattern": Copy the pattern template row into the output row.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the background color, which is consistently gray (7).
2.  For each row in the input grid:
    a.  Count the occurrences of each non-background color within that row.
    b.  Determine if any non-background color appears two or more times in the row.
    c.  If such a color `C` exists (assuming only one per row based on examples), mark this row as a "fill row" and note the color `C`.
    d.  Otherwise, mark this row as a "pattern row".
3.  Create a "pattern template" row:
    a.  Initialize a new row with the same width as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (7).
    b.  Examine all the input rows that were marked as "pattern rows" in step 2d.
    c.  Collect all non-background pixels (specifically their color and column index) found within these "pattern rows".
    d.  For each unique (color, column index) pair collected, place that color into the corresponding column of the "pattern template" row created in step 3a.
4.  Generate the output grid:
    a.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    b.  For each row index:
        i.  If the corresponding input row was marked as a "fill row" with color `C` in step 2c, fill the entire output row at this index with color `C`.
        ii. If the corresponding input row was marked as a "pattern row" in step 2d, copy the "pattern template" row (created in step 3) into the output row at this index.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
