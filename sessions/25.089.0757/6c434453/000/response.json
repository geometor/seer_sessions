These shapes vary in form. Some specific shapes appear multiple times across the examples, notably a 3x3 hollow square (`[[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]`).\n2.  **Output Grids:** The output grids are modifications of the input grids. The background remains white (0). Most of the blue (1) shapes from the input remain unchanged in the output. However, specific blue shapes are transformed.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying a particular 3x3 pattern in the input and replacing it with another 3x3 pattern in the output. Specifically, the 3x3 hollow blue square pattern is replaced by a red (2) plus sign pattern (`[[0,2,0],[2,2,2],[0,2,0]]`). Pixels not part of this specific pattern matching and replacement remain identical to the input.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The key object to identify is the 3x3 hollow blue square. Other blue shapes act as distractors or context but are not directly involved in the transformation.\n5.  **Color Change:** The transformation involves changing blue (1) pixels to red (2) pixels within the matched pattern, and also changing the central white (0) pixel of the hollow square to red (2). Some blue pixels from the original pattern (the corners) become white (0) in the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Define the target 3x3 pattern as a blue border with a white center: `[[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]`.\n3.  Define the replacement 3x3 pattern as a red plus sign: `[[0,2,0],[2,2,2],[0,2,0]]`.\n4.  Scan the input grid by examining every possible 3x3 subgrid. Iterate through rows `r` from 0 to `height-3` and columns `c` from 0 to `width-3`.\n5.  For each top-left coordinate (`r`, `c`), compare the 3x3 subgrid extracted from the input grid starting at (`r`, `c`) with the defined target pattern.\n6.  If the extracted subgrid exactly matches the target pattern, modify the *output* grid by replacing the 3x3 area starting at (`r`, `c`) with the defined replacement pattern.\n7.  Continue scanning until all possible 3x3 subgrids in the input have been checked.\n8.  The final state of the output grid is the result of the transformation."
