Grid:
  background_color: 0 (white)
  relevant_colors: [1 (blue), 2 (red)]

Objects:
  - type: Pattern
    name: Target Pattern
    description: A 3x3 subgrid consisting of a blue (1) border around a white (0) center.
    representation:
      [[1, 1, 1],
       [1, 0, 1],
       [1, 1, 1]]
  - type: Pattern
    name: Replacement Pattern
    description: A 3x3 subgrid representing a red (2) plus sign on a white (0) background.
    representation:
      [[0, 2, 0],
       [2, 2, 2],
       [0, 2, 0]]
  - type: Shapes
    name: Other Blue Shapes
    description: Various contiguous blocks of blue (1) pixels that do not match the Target Pattern.
    properties:
      color: 1 (blue)

Actions:
  - action: Find
    target: All occurrences of the Target Pattern within the input grid.
  - action: Replace
    target: Each found Target Pattern occurrence.
    replacement: The Replacement Pattern.
    location: The replacement occurs at the exact same 3x3 coordinates as the found Target Pattern.

Relationships:
  - The transformation is local to the 3x3 areas matching the Target Pattern.
  - Pixels outside these matched 3x3 areas (including Other Blue Shapes and background pixels) remain unchanged between the input and output grids.
  - The transformation rule is consistent across all provided examples.
