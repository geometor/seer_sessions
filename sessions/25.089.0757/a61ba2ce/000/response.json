The output grid is always 4x4 and seems to be a composite representation of the four input objects. Each input L-shape is mapped to a 2x2 subgrid within the output. The color of the input object is preserved in its corresponding 2x2 output subgrid. The placement of each 2x2 subgrid within the 4x4 output grid appears to depend solely on the specific orientation (shape type) of the input L-shape, not its position in the input grid. The 2x2 subgrid itself represents the L-shape using its color for the three filled pixels and white for the one empty pixel within the 2x2 bounding box.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

There are four possible orientations (empty cell at top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right).\n        c.  Create a 2x2 grid representing this L-shape. Fill the three cells corresponding to the object's pixels with the object's color, and fill the fourth cell (the empty one) with the background color (white, 0).\n        d.
