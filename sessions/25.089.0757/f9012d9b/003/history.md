1. Identify all row indices in the input grid that contain at least one white (0) pixel.
2. Generate all possible 2x2 subgrids from the input grid whose top row index is one of the identified indices.
3. Filter these 2x2 subgrids, keeping only those that do *not* contain any white (0) pixels.
4. For each remaining candidate subgrid, calculate the sum of its four pixel values.
5. Find the maximum sum among all candidate subgrids.
6. Identify all candidate subgrids that have this maximum sum.
7. If there are multiple candidates with the maximum sum, select the one whose top-left corner has the largest column index (the rightmost one).
8. Return this selected subgrid.
