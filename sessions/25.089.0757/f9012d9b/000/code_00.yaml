Input_Grid:
  Dimensions: 7x7
  Colors_Present: [Red (2), Gray (5), White (0)]
  Features:
    - Contains a block of White (0) pixels in the bottom-right 2x2 corner (rows 5-6, cols 5-6).
    - Contains repeating patterns (e.g., '2 2 5') horizontally.
Output_Grid:
  Dimensions: 2x2
  Colors_Present: [Gray (5), Red (2)]
  Value: [[5, 5], [5, 2]]
Transformation:
  Type: Subgrid Extraction
  Rule_Elements:
    - Identification of rows containing White (0) pixels.
    - Searching for 2x2 subgrids within those rows.
    - Filtering subgrids to exclude those containing White (0).
    - Applying selection criteria based on pixel sum (maximization) and position (rightmost in case of ties).
Relationship:
  - The output grid is a specific 2x2 subgrid extracted from the input grid.
  - The White (0) pixels in the input guide the selection process for the output subgrid. They identify the relevant rows and are excluded from the candidate subgrids.
