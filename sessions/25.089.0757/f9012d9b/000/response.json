The output is a much smaller 2x2 grid containing only red (2) and gray (5) pixels.\n3.  The white pixels (0) in the input are clustered together in the bottom-right 2x2 corner.\n4.  The output grid `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` exists as a contiguous 2x2 subgrid within the input grid, specifically starting at row index 5, column index 2.\n5.  This location of the output subgrid within the input seems related to the location of the white pixels. The white pixels occupy rows 5 and 6. The output subgrid also starts in row 5.\n6.  There are multiple 2x2 subgrids starting in row 5 of the input. A rule is needed to select the specific one that constitutes the output.\n7.  Comparing the candidate 2x2 subgrids in row 5 that do not contain white pixels, the output `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` is one of the two with the highest sum of pixel values (17). Among those two, it is the one located furthest to the right.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

For each candidate subgrid, calculate the sum of its four pixel values.\n5.  Find the maximum sum among all candidate subgrids.\n6.  Identify all candidate subgrids that have this maximum sum.\n7.  If there is only one candidate subgrid with the maximum sum, this subgrid is the output.\n8.  If there are multiple candidate subgrids with the maximum sum, select the one whose top-left corner has the largest column index (i.e., the rightmost one). This selected subgrid is the output."
