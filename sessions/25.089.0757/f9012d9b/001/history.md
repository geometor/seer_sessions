**output:**
```
5 5
5 2
```

Okay, let's analyze the provided training example.

**Perception**

1.  The input is a 7x7 grid containing red (2), gray (5), and white (0) pixels.
2.  The output is a much smaller 2x2 grid containing only red (2) and gray (5) pixels.
3.  The white pixels (0) in the input are clustered together in the bottom-right 2x2 corner.
4.  The output grid `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` exists as a contiguous 2x2 subgrid within the input grid, specifically starting at row index 5, column index 2.
5.  This location of the output subgrid within the input seems related to the location of the white pixels. The white pixels occupy rows 5 and 6. The output subgrid also starts in row 5.
6.  There are multiple 2x2 subgrids starting in row 5 of the input. A rule is needed to select the specific one that constitutes the output.
7.  Comparing the candidate 2x2 subgrids in row 5 that do not contain white pixels, the output `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` is one of the two with the highest sum of pixel values (17). Among those two, it is the one located furthest to the right.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input_Grid:
  Dimensions: 7x7
  Colors_Present: [Red (2), Gray (5), White (0)]
  Features:
    - Contains a block of White (0) pixels in the bottom-right 2x2 corner (rows 5-6, cols 5-6).
    - Contains repeating patterns (e.g., '2 2 5') horizontally.
Output_Grid:
  Dimensions: 2x2
  Colors_Present: [Gray (5), Red (2)]
  Value: [[5, 5], [5, 2]]
Transformation:
  Type: Subgrid Extraction
  Rule_Elements:
    - Identification of rows containing White (0) pixels.
    - Searching for 2x2 subgrids within those rows.
    - Filtering subgrids to exclude those containing White (0).
    - Applying selection criteria based on pixel sum (maximization) and position (rightmost in case of ties).
Relationship:
  - The output grid is a specific 2x2 subgrid extracted from the input grid.
  - The White (0) pixels in the input guide the selection process for the output subgrid. They identify the relevant rows and are excluded from the candidate subgrids.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all row indices in the input grid that contain at least one white (0) pixel. Let this set of row indices be `R`.
2.  Generate all possible 2x2 subgrids from the input grid whose top row index is included in `R`.
3.  Filter this collection of 2x2 subgrids, keeping only those that do *not* contain any white (0) pixels. These are the candidate subgrids.
4.  For each candidate subgrid, calculate the sum of its four pixel values.
5.  Find the maximum sum among all candidate subgrids.
6.  Identify all candidate subgrids that have this maximum sum.
7.  If there is only one candidate subgrid with the maximum sum, this subgrid is the output.
8.  If there are multiple candidate subgrids with the maximum sum, select the one whose top-left corner has the largest column index (i.e., the rightmost one). This selected subgrid is the output.
