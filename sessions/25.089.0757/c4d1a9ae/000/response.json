            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 2D grids of pixels, represented by integers 0-9 (colors). The input and output grids have the same dimensions in both examples (10x8).\n2.  **Color Preservation/Transformation:** Most colors in the input grid seem to remain in the same position in the output grid. However, one specific color in the input is selectively changed based on its column location and the context within that column.\n3.  **Background Color:** In both examples, there's a dominant color that appears most frequently. In `train_1`, it's yellow (4). In `train_2`, it's white (0). This dominant color seems to be the primary target for transformation. Let's call this the \"background color\".\n4.  **Column-Specific Rules:** The transformation applied to the background color is not uniform across the grid; it changes depending on the column.\n5.  **Contextual Influence:** Within a column, the transformation rule applied to the background color seems to depend on the *other* color(s) present in that same column. If a column contains only the background color, it remains unchanged. If a column contains the background color and exactly one other color, the background color pixels are changed to a *new* target color. This target color is determined by the identity of the *other* color present in the column.\n6.  **Fixed Mapping:** There appears to be a fixed mapping that determines the target color based on the non-background color found in the column.\n    *   If the other color is Red (2), the background becomes Magenta (6). (Seen in train_1, cols 0, 1)\n    *   If the other color is Magenta (6), the background becomes Gray (5). (Seen in train_1, cols 3, 4)\n    *   If the other color is Gray (5), the background becomes Red (2). (Seen in train_1, col 6)\n    *   If the other color is Yellow (4), the background becomes Green (3). (Seen in train_2, cols 0, 1, 2)\n    *   If the other color is Green (3), the background becomes Maroon (9). (Seen in train_2, col 4)\n    *   If the other color is Maroon (9), the background becomes Yellow (4). (Seen in train_2, cols 6, 7)\n7.  **Non-Background Color Preservation:** Colors that are *not* the background color appear to remain unchanged in their positions.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
