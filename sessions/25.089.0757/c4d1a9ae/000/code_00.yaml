objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - height: integer
      - width: integer
      - pixels: 2D array of colors (0-9)
  - name: column
    properties:
      - index: integer (0 to width-1)
      - unique_colors: set of colors present
      - background_color: the most frequent color in the overall grid
      - non_background_color: the single color in the column that is not the background_color (if one exists)
  - name: pixel
    properties:
      - row: integer
      - column: integer
      - color: integer (0-9)
actions:
  - name: identify_background_color
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: background_color
    description: Find the color that appears most frequently in the input grid.
  - name: determine_column_context
    inputs: input_grid_column, background_color
    outputs: non_background_color or None
    description: Find the set of unique colors in the column. If the set contains the background_color and exactly one other color, return the other color. Otherwise, return None.
  - name: map_color
    inputs: non_background_color
    outputs: target_color
    description: Apply a fixed mapping {2:6, 6:5, 5:2, 4:3, 3:9, 9:4} to find the color to replace the background color with.
  - name: transform_grid
    inputs: input_grid, background_color, mapping
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by selectively replacing background_color pixels based on the column context and the color mapping.
relationships:
  - type: conditional_transformation
    scope: column
    condition: The column contains the background color and exactly one other unique color ('O').
    effect: Pixels with the background color in that column are changed to a target color 'T'.
  - type: mapping
    input: other_color 'O'
    output: target_color 'T'
    details: The target color 'T' is determined by a fixed mapping based on the other color 'O' present in the column (2->6, 6->5, 5->2, 4->3, 3->9, 9->4).
  - type: identity_transformation
    scope: pixel
    condition: The pixel's color is not the background color, OR the pixel is in a column that does not meet the condition for transformation (e.g., contains only background, or background + multiple other colors).
    effect: The pixel's color remains unchanged from input to output.
