It contains four non-white pixels in all examples.\n3.  **Main Grid Area:** The rest of the grid contains various shapes and patterns composed of different colors.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to be a color substitution applied to the main grid area, while the top-left 2x2 area remains unchanged. The specific colors involved in the substitution seem to be defined by the colors within that top-left 2x2 area.\n5.  **Color Swapping:** By comparing input and output grids (excluding the top-left 2x2), specific colors in the input are consistently replaced by other specific colors in the output. For example, in `train_1`:\n    *   Input yellow (4) becomes red (2).\n    *   Input red (2) becomes yellow (4).\n    *   Input green (3) becomes orange (7).\n    *   Input orange (7) becomes green (3).\n    *   These substitutions correspond exactly to the pairs of colors found horizontally in the top-left 2x2 area: (yellow, red) i.e., (4, 2) in the first row, and (green, orange) i.e., (3, 7) in the second row.\n6.  **Consistency:** This pattern of defining color swaps using the top-left 2x2 pairs holds true for `train_2` ((blue, green) <-> (1, 3), (red, azure) <-> (2, 8)) and `train_3` ((maroon, yellow) <-> (9, 4), (orange, magenta) <-> (7, 6)).\n7.  **Scope:** The color swapping rule applies only to the pixels *outside* the top-left 2x2 area. The pixels within the 2x2 area ((0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)) are preserved exactly as they were in the input. Other colors (like white/0) not involved in the defined swaps also remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
