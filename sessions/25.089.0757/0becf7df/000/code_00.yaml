Grid_Properties:
  - Dimensions: Consistent between input and output for each example.
  - Background: Predominantly white (0).

Objects:
  - Type: Control_Area
    Location: Top-left 2x2 corner (cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)).
    Content: Contains four non-white pixels defining color pairs.
    Persistence: Unchanged between input and output.
  - Type: Main_Grid_Content
    Location: All cells outside the Control_Area.
    Content: Various shapes and patterns made of non-white pixels.
    Transformation: Undergoes color substitution based on rules from Control_Area.

Color_Pairs:
  - Source: Defined by the Control_Area.
  - Pair_1: Color at (0,0) and color at (0,1). Let's call them C1 and C2.
  - Pair_2: Color at (1,0) and color at (1,1). Let's call them C3 and C4.

Actions:
  - Identify: Determine the four colors (C1, C2, C3, C4) in the Control_Area of the input.
  - Map_Colors: Establish a swapping map: C1 <-> C2, C3 <-> C4.
  - Apply_Map: Iterate through all cells in the Main_Grid_Content of the input.
  - Substitute: For each cell in the Main_Grid_Content:
      - If color is C1, replace with C2 in the output.
      - If color is C2, replace with C1 in the output.
      - If color is C3, replace with C4 in the output.
      - If color is C4, replace with C3 in the output.
      - Otherwise, keep the original color.
  - Preserve: Copy the Control_Area from the input directly to the output.

Relationships:
  - The Control_Area defines the color transformation rules for the Main_Grid_Content.
  - The transformation affects only colors present in the Control_Area pairs.
  - The transformation preserves the spatial arrangement (shape and position) of pixels in the Main_Grid_Content, only altering their colors according to the defined swaps.
