The output grids show these same shapes, but they appear to have been shifted horizontally to the right by one column position. Any colored pixel in the input grid located at `(row, column)` seems to move to `(row, column + 1)` in the output grid. The background remains white. Pixels that would shift beyond the right edge of the grid are effectively removed. The space previously occupied by pixels in the first column (column 0) becomes white in the output. The transformation applies independently to all non-white pixels, regardless of their color or the shape they form.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
