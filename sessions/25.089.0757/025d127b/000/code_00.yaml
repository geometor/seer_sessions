Task: Horizontal Pixel Shift Right

Grid_Properties:
  - Background_Color: white (0)
  - Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 8x9, 14x9)

Objects:
  - Definition: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
  - Colors_Observed: azure (8), magenta (6), red (2)
  - Count: Can be one or more per grid.
  - Significance: The specific shape or color of objects does not seem to affect the core transformation rule, only which pixels are affected.

Transformation:
  - Type: Positional Shift
  - Affected_Pixels: All non-white pixels.
  - Action: Each non-white pixel is moved one position horizontally.
  - Direction: Right (+1 column index).
  - Boundary_Handling:
    - Pixels moving from column `c` move to column `c+1`.
    - Pixels that would move beyond the rightmost column boundary are discarded (do not appear in the output).
    - Positions originally occupied by shifted pixels become white (background color).

Relationships:
  - Input_Output_Mapping: For an input pixel at `(r, c)` with a non-white color `X`:
    - If `c+1` is within the grid width, the output pixel at `(r, c+1)` has color `X`.
    - All other output pixels are white (0).
