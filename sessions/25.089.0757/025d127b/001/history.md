Okay, let's break down the task based on the examples.

## Perception

The input grids contain one or more distinct shapes (objects) composed of colored pixels (azure, magenta, red) set against a white background. The output grids show these same shapes, but they appear to have been shifted horizontally to the right by one column position. Any colored pixel in the input grid located at `(row, column)` seems to move to `(row, column + 1)` in the output grid. The background remains white. Pixels that would shift beyond the right edge of the grid are effectively removed. The space previously occupied by pixels in the first column (column 0) becomes white in the output. The transformation applies independently to all non-white pixels, regardless of their color or the shape they form.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Horizontal Pixel Shift Right

Grid_Properties:
  - Background_Color: white (0)
  - Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 8x9, 14x9)

Objects:
  - Definition: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
  - Colors_Observed: azure (8), magenta (6), red (2)
  - Count: Can be one or more per grid.
  - Significance: The specific shape or color of objects does not seem to affect the core transformation rule, only which pixels are affected.

Transformation:
  - Type: Positional Shift
  - Affected_Pixels: All non-white pixels.
  - Action: Each non-white pixel is moved one position horizontally.
  - Direction: Right (+1 column index).
  - Boundary_Handling:
    - Pixels moving from column `c` move to column `c+1`.
    - Pixels that would move beyond the rightmost column boundary are discarded (do not appear in the output).
    - Positions originally occupied by shifted pixels become white (background color).

Relationships:
  - Input_Output_Mapping: For an input pixel at `(r, c)` with a non-white color `X`:
    - If `c+1` is within the grid width, the output pixel at `(r, c+1)` has color `X`.
    - All other output pixels are white (0).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, and initialize all its pixels to white (0).
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid, examining its row index `r`, column index `c`, and color `C`.
3.  If the color `C` of the input pixel at `(r, c)` is *not* white (0):
    a.  Calculate the target column index `c_new = c + 1`.
    b.  Check if `c_new` is less than the width of the grid.
    c.  If `c_new` is within the grid bounds, set the pixel at `(r, c_new)` in the *output* grid to color `C`.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
