Both input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n2.  **Row-Based Operation:** The changes seem to happen row by row. Specifically, only the odd-indexed rows (row 1, 3, 5, ...) are modified. Even-indexed rows (row 0, 2, 4, ...) remain unchanged.\n3.  **Conditional Modification:** The modification in an odd row `i` depends on a comparison with the previous row `i-1`.\n4.  **Segment Identification:** Within an odd row `i`, a specific contiguous horizontal segment of pixels is identified for modification. This segment appears to be defined by the columns where row `i` differs from row `i-1`. The segment starts at the first column of difference and extends one column beyond the last column of difference.\n5.  **Transformation:** The identified segment undergoes a specific transformation: a right cyclic shift. The last pixel in the segment moves to the first position, and all other pixels shift one position to the right.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
