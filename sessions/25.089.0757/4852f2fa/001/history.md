Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of the elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids are consistently 9x9. They contain a white background (0), a single contiguous object composed of azure pixels (8), and one or more isolated yellow pixels (4).
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids vary in size. They contain only the azure object pattern from the input, repeated horizontally multiple times, separated by the background color (0) where appropriate within the original pattern's bounding box. The yellow pixels from the input are absent in the output.
3.  **Key Objects:**
    *   The **Azure Object**: A single, connected shape made of azure pixels (8). Its shape varies across examples but is consistent within each input/output pair.
    *   **Yellow Pixels**: Individual, isolated yellow pixels (4). Their positions vary, but their count seems significant.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve extracting the azure object and replicating it horizontally. The number of replications seems directly related to the number of yellow pixels present in the input grid.

**YAML Block of Facts:**

relationships:

    source: count of yellow_marker objects
    target: number of horizontal replications of the azure_shape pattern in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single, contiguous object composed of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Determine the smallest rectangular bounding box that completely encloses this azure object. Extract the subgrid defined by this bounding box; this is the "pattern".
3.  Count the total number of yellow (4) pixels present anywhere in the input grid. Let this count be `N`.
4.  Construct the output grid by horizontally tiling the extracted "pattern" `N` times. The height of the output grid will be the height of the pattern, and the width will be the width of the pattern multiplied by `N`.
