task_description: Replicate an azure object based on the count of yellow pixels.
elements:
  - element_type: grid
    role: input
    properties:
      - size: 9x9 (consistent across examples)
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains:
          - object: azure_shape
            count: 1
            color: azure (8)
            connectivity: contiguous
          - object: yellow_marker
            count: variable (1 to 4 in examples)
            color: yellow (4)
            shape: single pixel
            connectivity: isolated
  - element_type: grid
    role: output
    properties:
      - size: variable height and width
      - background_color: white (0) (within the pattern's bounding box)
      - contains:
          - object: azure_shape_tiled
            color: azure (8)
            description: The azure_shape from the input, tiled horizontally.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: azure_shape
    description: Locate the contiguous block of azure pixels.
  - action: extract
    target: azure_shape
    description: Determine the minimal bounding box containing the azure_shape and extract this subgrid pattern.
  - action: count
    target: yellow_marker
    description: Count the total number of yellow pixels in the input grid. Store this as 'replication_factor'.
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create a new grid by horizontally tiling the extracted azure_shape pattern 'replication_factor' times.
    properties:
      - output_height: height of the extracted azure_shape pattern.
      - output_width: width of the extracted azure_shape pattern multiplied by 'replication_factor'.
      - tiling: Horizontal concatenation of the extracted pattern.
relationships:
  - type: determines
    source: count of yellow_marker objects
    target: number of horizontal replications of the azure_shape pattern in the output.
