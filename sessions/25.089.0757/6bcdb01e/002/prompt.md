"""
Identify the initial green (3) pixels in the input grid.
Starting from these green pixels, perform a flood fill operation.
The fill should only spread to adjacent orange (7) pixels, considering both cardinal and diagonal neighbors (8-connectivity).
Change the color of these connected orange pixels to green (3).
All other pixels (including the initial green pixels and any other colors like azure 8) remain unchanged.
