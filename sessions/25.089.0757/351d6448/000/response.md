Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids have a recurring structure. They are composed of multiple horizontal sections separated by solid lines of gray pixels (color 5). Above the first gray line and between subsequent gray lines, there are sections typically 3 rows high.
2.  **Objects:** Within these 3-row sections, usually in the middle row, there's a distinct colored object (red/green shape in train_1, blue line in train_2) placed against a white background (color 0).
3.  **Pattern/Sequence:** Observing the objects section by section from top to bottom reveals a clear progression or pattern.
    *   In `train_1`, the `2 2 3` (red-red-green) object shifts one column to the right in each subsequent section.
    *   In `train_2`, the horizontal blue line (color 1) increases its length by 2 pixels in each subsequent section, while maintaining its starting column position.
4.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is always a 3-row grid with the same width as the input grid. It contains mostly white background pixels.
5.  **Transformation:** The output grid seems to represent the *next logical step* in the sequence observed in the input. The object present in the output is the one that would follow the established pattern, placed in the middle row (row index 1) of the 3xN output grid. The gray separator lines are removed.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Predict the next state in a sequence depicted vertically in the input grid.
grid_properties:
  background_color: 0 (white)
  separator_color: 5 (gray)
  separator_orientation: horizontal
input_structure:
  - sections: Vertically stacked segments, separated by horizontal gray lines.
  - section_height: Typically 3 rows (object row flanked by background rows).
  - objects_per_section: One primary colored object per section.
object_properties:
  - color: Varies (red/green in train_1, blue in train_2).
  - shape: Varies (composite shape in train_1, line in train_2).
  - position: Varies, determined by the sequence.
  - size: Varies, determined by the sequence.
sequence_pattern:
  - type: Progression based on object properties (position, size) across sections from top to bottom.
  - train_1_pattern: Object shifts one column right per section.
  - train_2_pattern: Object length increases by 2 per section.
transformation:
  - identify_sections: Locate sections based on gray separators.
  - extract_objects: Isolate the primary object from each section.
  - determine_pattern: Analyze the sequence of objects to find the rule of progression (e.g., change in position, size, color).
  - predict_next: Calculate the properties (shape, size, color, position) of the object for the next step in the sequence.
  - generate_output: Create a 3-row grid (same width as input) with the predicted object placed in the middle row (row 1) at its predicted position against a white background.
output_structure:
  - dimensions: 3 rows, same width as input.
  - content: White background with the single predicted object in the middle row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the horizontal lines composed entirely of gray pixels (color 5). These lines act as separators.
2.  Define the sections of the input grid: the rows above the first gray line, and the rows between consecutive gray lines. Each section typically consists of 3 rows.
3.  For each section, locate the primary non-background, non-separator object(s). Record their properties (shape, color, size) and position (specifically, the row and starting column of the object, typically found in the middle row of the 3-row section).
4.  Analyze the sequence of these objects from the top section to the bottom section to determine the pattern of change. This could involve changes in horizontal position, size, or shape.
5.  Based on the identified pattern, predict the properties and position of the object that would appear in the *next* hypothetical section following the last section in the input.
6.  Create a new output grid with 3 rows and the same width as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, color 0).
7.  Place the predicted object into the middle row (row index 1) of this new output grid, using its predicted properties (shape, color, size) and predicted starting column.
8.  Return the generated 3-row grid as the output.
