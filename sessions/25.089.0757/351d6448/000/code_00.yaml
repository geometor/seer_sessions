task_description: Predict the next state in a sequence depicted vertically in the input grid.
grid_properties:
  background_color: 0 (white)
  separator_color: 5 (gray)
  separator_orientation: horizontal
input_structure:
  - sections: Vertically stacked segments, separated by horizontal gray lines.
  - section_height: Typically 3 rows (object row flanked by background rows).
  - objects_per_section: One primary colored object per section.
object_properties:
  - color: Varies (red/green in train_1, blue in train_2).
  - shape: Varies (composite shape in train_1, line in train_2).
  - position: Varies, determined by the sequence.
  - size: Varies, determined by the sequence.
sequence_pattern:
  - type: Progression based on object properties (position, size) across sections from top to bottom.
  - train_1_pattern: Object shifts one column right per section.
  - train_2_pattern: Object length increases by 2 per section.
transformation:
  - identify_sections: Locate sections based on gray separators.
  - extract_objects: Isolate the primary object from each section.
  - determine_pattern: Analyze the sequence of objects to find the rule of progression (e.g., change in position, size, color).
  - predict_next: Calculate the properties (shape, size, color, position) of the object for the next step in the sequence.
  - generate_output: Create a 3-row grid (same width as input) with the predicted object placed in the middle row (row 1) at its predicted position against a white background.
output_structure:
  - dimensions: 3 rows, same width as input.
  - content: White background with the single predicted object in the middle row.
