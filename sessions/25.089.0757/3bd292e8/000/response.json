They seem to function as fixed elements or boundaries.\n4.  **Dynamic Elements:** The Orange (7) pixels in the input grid are the ones that change color in the output grid. They become either Green (3) or Gray (5).\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The change from Orange (7) to either Green (3) or Gray (5) appears to depend on the spatial relationship between groups of Orange pixels and the fixed Red pixels. Specifically, it looks like connected regions (components) of Orange pixels are evaluated based on their proximity to any Red pixel.\n6.  **Connected Components:** If we consider groups of Orange (7) pixels that are connected side-by-side (4-way adjacency), the rule seems to be:\n    *   If *any* pixel within a connected component of Orange pixels is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a Red (2) pixel, then *all* pixels in that Orange component are changed to Green (3) in the output.\n    *   If a connected component of Orange pixels is *not* adjacent (4-way) to *any* Red (2) pixel, then *all* pixels in that Orange component are changed to Gray (5) in the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
