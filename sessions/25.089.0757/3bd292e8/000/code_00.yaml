task_description: Color transformation based on adjacency to static elements.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: true # Input and output grids have the same height and width.
involved_colors:
  - input: [2 (Red), 7 (Orange)]
  - output: [2 (Red), 3 (Green), 5 (Gray)]
objects:
  - type: static_pixels
    color: 2 (Red)
    description: Remain unchanged in the output grid. Act as boundaries or influencers.
  - type: dynamic_pixels
    color: 7 (Orange)
    description: Change color based on their relationship to Red pixels. Treated as connected components.
    connectivity: 4-way (von Neumann)
transformation_rules:
  - rule: Identify connected components of Orange (7) pixels using 4-way adjacency.
  - rule: For each Orange component:
      - check: Is any pixel in the component 4-way adjacent to any Red (2) pixel?
      - if_true: Change all pixels of this component to Green (3).
      - if_false: Change all pixels of this component to Gray (5).
  - rule: Keep all Red (2) pixels unchanged.
