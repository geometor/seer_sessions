Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids primarily consist of a white background (0) with a few scattered gray pixels (5). The gray pixels appear isolated from each other.
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids retain the original gray pixels (5) from the input. The key change is the appearance of blue pixels (1).
3.  **Transformation:** The blue pixels (1) form a 3x3 square pattern *around* each of the original gray pixels. Crucially, the center position of this 3x3 square, where the gray pixel was in the input, remains gray in the output. The blue pixels replace the white pixels that were originally in the 8 cells surrounding the gray pixel.
4.  **Object Identification:** The primary objects are the individual gray pixels (5) in the input.
5.  **Action:** For each gray pixel identified in the input, an action is performed: drawing a 3x3 "frame" of blue pixels (1) around its location in the output grid. The original gray pixel is preserved.
6.  **Color Mapping:** White (0) -> Blue (1) in the 8 adjacent cells (including diagonals) around a gray pixel. Gray (5) -> Gray (5). Other White (0) -> White (0).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0).
2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid using its row (`r`) and column (`c`) coordinates.
3.  Read the color value of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid.
4.  Copy this color value to the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the output grid.
5.  After copying all pixels, iterate through the input grid again to find the locations of all gray (5) pixels.
6.  For each gray pixel found at input location `(gr, gc)`:
    a.  Iterate through the 3x3 neighborhood centered at `(gr, gc)`. This includes coordinates `(nr, nc)` where `nr` ranges from `gr-1` to `gr+1` and `nc` ranges from `gc-1` to `gc+1`.
    b.  For each neighbor coordinate `(nr, nc)`:
        i.  Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the bounds of the grid.
        ii. Check if `(nr, nc)` is *not* the center coordinate `(gr, gc)`.
        iii. If both checks pass, set the pixel at `(nr, nc)` in the *output* grid to blue (1). (Note: This might overwrite pixels copied in step 4, which is intended behavior for the white pixels adjacent to gray ones. The gray pixel itself at `(gr, gc)` is protected by check ii).
7.  Return the final output grid.
