Each row has the same number of squares, and all squares within a row are the same color. The two rows have different colors.\n*   **Output:** Two rows of colored squares, where the colors alternate between the two colors present in the input. The top-left square of the output has the same color as the top row of the input. The dimensions (number of rows and columns) remain constant.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts)**\n\n"

Fill the new grid by alternating colors as follows:\n    *   Row 1, Column 1: color\\_1\n    *   Row 1, Column 2: color\\_2\n    *   Row 1, Column 3: color\\_1\n    *  ... continue alternating\n    *   Row 2, Column 1: color\\_2\n    *   Row 2, Column 2: color\\_1\n    *   Row 2, Column 3: color\\_2\n    * ... continue alternating\n\n3.  **Output:** Return the new 2xN grid with alternating colors. The alternation in the first row starts with the original first row color. The alternation in the second row starts with the original second row color.\n\nIn essence, the transformation takes the two input rows and interleaves their colors column by column in the output grid, creating a checkerboard-like pattern within each row, and ensuring corresponding positions on different rows have different colors.\n"
