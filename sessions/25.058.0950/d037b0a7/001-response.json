Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The transformation appears to involve replicating certain non-zero values within the grid. The core operation seems to involve copying colors from the top row and applying it downwards.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Identify any non-zero values (colors other than white).\n\n2.  **Replicate Downwards:** For each non-zero value found in the top row, replicate that value downwards in the same column. Specifically:\n    *   If a cell in the top row has a non-zero value, copy that value to the cells in the same column in the second row (row 1) and the third row (row 2).\n\n3.  **Leave Other Cells Unchanged:** Any cells that don't have non-zero on first row remains the original value in input grid.\n\nIn essence, the transformation takes the colors present in the top row and \"drops\" them down, filling the corresponding columns below.\n"
