- observation: "The input and output grids always have the same dimensions (3x3)."
- observation: "Non-zero values are being copied, not just moved."
- observation: "The position of the copied value changes."
- observation: "The code correctly handles cases where a non-zero value exists in the first example."
- observation: "The code incorrectly assumes the copy always happens from row 2 to row 3.  In examples 3 and 4, no copying should happen according to the current program, and example 2, a value is not copied to row 3"
- pattern: "A single non-zero pixel in the input is duplicated in the output"
- pattern: "The duplicated pixel is adjacent to the original pixel"
- hypothesis: "If a pixel is non-zero, copy it to an adjacent pixel, and if it's in a corner, prioritize copying vertically. If not, copy horizontally."
- hypothesis:  "The non-zero color is copied down one row"
- hypothesis: "If the non-zero value is in the top row, copy it to the row directly below it"
- hypothesis: "If the non-zero value is in the second row, and in the last column, copy it to the row directly below it"
