**input:**
```
0 2 0

0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BED6343C50>

**output:**
```
0 2 0
7 2 8

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid. The most notable change is the replication of the non-zero values from the second row of the input to the third row. The zeros in input remain unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - rows: 3
      - columns: 3
      - colors: Represented by integers

actions:
  - type: copy
    source: row 2, non-zero elements
    destination: row 3, corresponding column positions
    conditions:
      - element != 0

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Elements are arranged in a 2D grid.
  - type: conditional
    description: non zero values are copied, zeros are maintained
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The primary object is a 3x3 grid.
2.  **Iterate Rows:** Focus on the second row of the grid.
3.  **Copy and replace:** Copy the values of each cell in the second row to corresponding cells in the third row, preserving the value 0, if it exists.

Another option is:

1. Iterate through columns.
2. For each column identify non-zero values in second row.
3. Replace the corresponding value in third row with second row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
