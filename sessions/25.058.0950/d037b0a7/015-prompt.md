Previous Code:
```python
"""
Copies the non-zero values from the second row of the input grid to the third row, while leaving other rows unchanged.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Copies the non-zero values from the second row to the third row of a 3x3 grid.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)  # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original

    # Iterate through the columns of the second row
    for col in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
        # Copy the value from the second row to the third row if it's non-zero
        if output_grid[1, col] != 0:
            output_grid[2, col] = output_grid[1, col]
        # else zero is maintained

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
