Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  Identify: Find all yellow (4) and red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Extend Downwards Conditionally: For each yellow or red pixel, copy its color to the cells directly below it in the same column.
3.  Stopping Condition: Stop extending the color downwards when a black (1) pixel is encountered or the bottom of the grid is reached.
4. Preserve other colors: If the color is any color other than yellow or red, leave it unchanged.
"""

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
