Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation of the input grid. Each element (pixel) in the input grid is moved to its new position in the output grid according to this rotation. The color/value of each pixel remains constant; only its position changes. The rotation is applied regardless of the original dimensions of the input grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Rotate the array 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    output_array = np.rot90(input_array, k=1)

    # Convert the result back to a list.
    return output_array.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the rotation code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program described a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation, and the code implemented this using `np.rot90`. The results indicate that this transformation is correct for all provided training examples. Since the code correctly handles all given examples, there are no errors. The general approach and code were excellent.

My strategy is, as instructed, to provide:

1.  Metrics about each example.
2.  A YAML block documenting observations (objects, properties, actions).
3.  A refined natural language program.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's an analysis of each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 3x3
    *   Output Shape: 3x3
    *   Transformation: 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The code correctly rotated all the cells and colors.
    *    Result: correct

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 5x3
    *   Output Shape: 3x5
    *   Transformation: 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The code correctly rotated all the cells and colors.
    *    Result: correct

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 7x7
    *   Output Shape: 7x7
    *   Transformation: 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The code correctly rotated all the cells and colors.
        *    Result: correct

**YAML Block**

```yaml
observations:
  - task: 00d62c1b
    examples:
      - example_1:
        input_grid_shape: 3x3
        output_grid_shape: 3x3
        objects:
          - description: Entire grid
            properties:
              - shape: input_grid_shape
              - rotation: 90 degrees counter-clockwise
            actions:
              - name: rotate_90_ccw
                result: output_grid

                - name: rotate_90_ccw
                  result: output_grid
      - example_3:

          output_grid_shape: 7x7
          objects:
            - description: Entire grid
              properties:
                - shape: input_grid_shape
                - rotation: 90 degrees counter-clockwise
              actions:
                - name: rotate_90_ccw
                  result: output_grid
```

**Natural Language Program**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid. Each pixel in the input grid retains its original color/value and is repositioned according to the 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The dimensions of the output grid are determined by the rotation of the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
