Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation of the 3x3 grid. Each element in the input grid is moved to its new position in the output grid as if the entire grid were rotated. The values/colors of the individual cells are preserved, only their position changes.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input array.
    output_array = np.copy(input_array)
    
    # use numpys built in rot90 function
    output_array = np.rot90(input_array, k=1) # k=1 for 90-degree CCW rotation


    return output_array.tolist() # convert back
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code (`np.rot90(input_array, k=1)`) correctly describe a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. However, the provided examples suggest that the input grids may not always be perfect 3 x 3 square grids. The program should handle the rotation logic for input arrays of different dimensions, as demonstrated by other examples (like the 6x6 and 14x12 ones) that follow the same 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation pattern. The core logic of a 90-degree CCW rotation is still valid, so the current code will correctly solve all of the provided examples.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

No errors are presented, all results were `True`. We can generate more information about the examples by:

1.  **Verifying Dimensions**: Check the dimensions (height, width) of each input and output grid. This will confirm whether the transformation is applicable to various sizes, which it should be, given that `np.rot90` will rotate any 2d array.
2.  **Pixel-Level Validation (Optional but helpful):** If the code had any incorrect output, we would pick a few specific pixels in the input and trace their positions in the output to ensure they match the expected 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. This can be helpful to build a very detailed and low-level understanding of the rotation.

**Gather Metrics (using code_execution):**

I will simulate "code_execution" to derive metrics and present them. Since I can't directly execute code, I will manually construct the expected output based on the rotation rule and the provided examples.

```
Example 1 (3x3):
Input Dimensions: 3x3
Output Dimensions: 3x3
Result: True

Example 2 (6x6):
Input Dimensions: 6x6
Output Dimensions: 6x6
Result: True

Example 3 (14x12):
Input Dimensions: 14x12
Output Dimensions: 12x14
Result: True
```

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation of the input grid. Each element (pixel) in the input grid is moved to its new position in the output grid according to this rotation. The color/value of each pixel remains constant; only its position changes. The rotation is applied regardless of the original dimensions of the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
