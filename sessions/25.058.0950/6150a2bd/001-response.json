Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of colored pixels, represented by integers. The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example pair. The transformation seems to involve a rotation of the grid, and possibly some form of color/value preservation. The position and arrangement of colors change, but the set of colors present, and the general shape they make remain consistent within a transformation.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

This involves:\n    *   The top-left element of the input becomes the top-right element of the output.\n    *   The top row of the input becomes the rightmost column of the output.\n    *   The rightmost column of the input becomes the bottom row of the output (reversed).\n    *   The bottom row of the input becomes the leftmost column of the output (reversed).\n    *   The leftmost column of the input becomes the top row of the output.\n3. **Output:** A 2D grid that is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid.\n\nThis simple, clear, and effective description is the core information I want to remember for the next step.\n"
