Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid contains various colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9), and the output grid seems to be a transformation of the input. The colors and positions of the pixels change between the input and output. There's a noticeable change in the arrangement and values of non-zero pixels. The zero-value pixels (white) seem to largely stay in place, acting like a background.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - attribute: color
        values: 0-9 (mapped to colors)
      - attribute: position
        values: (row, column) coordinates

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - attribute: color
        values: 0-9 (mapped to colors)
      - attribute: position
        values: (row, column) coordinates

actions:
  - name: transpose_and_rotate
    description: The non-zero pixels appear to be transposed and rotated somehow.
  - name: value_mirror
    description: Pixel values in top row are moved to the bottom, and colors in first column are moved to last

relationships:
  - grid_contains: pixels
  - pixels_adjacent: pixels (horizontally, vertically, diagonally)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a value other than 0 (white).

2.  **Mirror, Top to Bottom:** The values in the top row of the input are mirrored to the bottom row of the output.

3. **Mirror, Left to Right:** The Values in the leftmost column of the input are mirrored to the rightmost column of the output.

4. **Preserve Zeroes:** Maintain the locations all of the zero (white) cells.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
