"""
The transformation rule appears to be the identity transformation, meaning the input grid is returned unchanged. Despite the initial failed attempt with a transpose operation, a closer re-examination of all provided training examples reveals that the input and output grids are identical in every case.  This suggests the correct transformation is simply to return the input grid as is.
