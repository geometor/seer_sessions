Okay, let's analyze the results of the rotation code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program described a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation, and the code implemented this using `np.rot90`. The results indicate that this transformation is correct for all provided training examples. Since the code correctly handles all given examples, there are no errors. The general approach and code were excellent.

My strategy is, as instructed, to provide:

1.  Metrics about each example.
2.  A YAML block documenting observations (objects, properties, actions).
3.  A refined natural language program.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's an analysis of each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 3x3
    *   Output Shape: 3x3
    *   Transformation: 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The code correctly rotated all the cells and colors.
    *    Result: correct

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 5x3
    *   Output Shape: 3x5
    *   Transformation: 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The code correctly rotated all the cells and colors.
    *    Result: correct

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 7x7
    *   Output Shape: 7x7
    *   Transformation: 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The code correctly rotated all the cells and colors.
        *    Result: correct

**YAML Block**

```yaml
observations:
  - task: 00d62c1b
    examples:
      - example_1:
        input_grid_shape: 3x3
        output_grid_shape: 3x3
        objects:
          - description: Entire grid
            properties:
              - shape: input_grid_shape
              - rotation: 90 degrees counter-clockwise
            actions:
              - name: rotate_90_ccw
                result: output_grid
      - example_2:
          input_grid_shape: 5x3
          output_grid_shape: 3x5
          objects:
            - description: Entire grid
              properties:
                - shape: input_grid_shape
                - rotation: 90 degrees counter-clockwise
              actions:
                - name: rotate_90_ccw
                  result: output_grid
      - example_3:
          input_grid_shape: 7x7
          output_grid_shape: 7x7
          objects:
            - description: Entire grid
              properties:
                - shape: input_grid_shape
                - rotation: 90 degrees counter-clockwise
              actions:
                - name: rotate_90_ccw
                  result: output_grid
```

**Natural Language Program**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid. Each pixel in the input grid retains its original color/value and is repositioned according to the 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The dimensions of the output grid are determined by the rotation of the input grid.
