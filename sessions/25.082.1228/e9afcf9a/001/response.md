The input grid consists of two rows of equal length, each filled with a distinct single color. 
The output grid is constructed with the same dimensions as the input grid.
The first row of the output grid alternates between the color of the first and second rows of the input, starting with the first row's color.
The second row of the output grid alternates between the color of the second and first rows of the input, starting with the second row's color.
The result is a checkerboard-style pattern made from the two colors used in the input.
