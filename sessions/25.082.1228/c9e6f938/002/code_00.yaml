observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: variable (3 in examples)
      - width: variable (3 in examples)
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: same as input_grid
      - width: twice the input_grid width
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)

  - action: horizontal_expansion
    description: Doubles the width of the grid.
    details:
      - Each original column is copied.
      - A new column is inserted after each original column.
      - inserted_column_logic: "The values in inserted columns mirror the values to its right if not 0. If the value to the right is 0, the mirror will be 0"

  - pattern: mirroring
    description: Values in the inserted columns are sometimes copies of adjacent original column values. They are copied when not 0.
    details: |
        The inserted column takes the values from its right neighboring column.  If a cell in the right neighboring column has color 'orange' (7), the corresponding cell in the inserted column will also be 'orange'.  If a cell in the right neighboring column is 'white'(0), the inserted column cell will be white (0).
