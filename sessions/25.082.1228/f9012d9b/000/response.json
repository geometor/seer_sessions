This suggests a process of reduction, extraction, or summarization, rather than a rearrangement or simple transformation of the whole input.\n*   There's no immediately obvious geometric transformation (rotation, reflection, etc.). The relationship seems to be based on pattern recognition within the input.\n*   The examples show different input and output sizes and values which suggests the need for a general rule, not input-specific.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
