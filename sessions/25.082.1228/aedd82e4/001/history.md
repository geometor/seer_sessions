Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on identifying the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   The dominant colors are '0' (white) and '2' (red).
*   The transformation seems to involve changing some '2' (red) pixels to '1' (blue) pixels.
*   The location of the changed pixel seems related to the bottom-right corner of the '2' (red) shapes.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: red_object
    type: contiguous_block
    color: 2
    properties:
        - bounding_box: variable
        
  - name: blue_pixel
    type: single_pixel
    color: 1
    properties:
        - location: changes

  - name: background
    type: background
    color: 0
    properties:
      - constant

actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: red_object
    target:  pixel on the bottom or to the right of the red shape
    precondition:
      - pixel is red (color value of 2)
      - the x and y coord of the pixel is described as the rightmost edge of the shape's bounding box and the bottom of its bounding box
    postcondition:
        pixel becomes blue (color value of 1)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The blue pixel appears at locations previously occupied by red pixels at the bottom-right periphery of a contiguous red shape.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all contiguous blocks of '2' (red) pixels. Consider each as a distinct object.
2.  For each red object, examine its edges. Find the lowest, rightmost red pixel (2) in the object.
3.  Change this identified red pixel to '1' (blue).
4.  All other pixels remain unchanged.

In summary: the red shapes seem to have the lowest and rightmost of their shape changed to blue.
