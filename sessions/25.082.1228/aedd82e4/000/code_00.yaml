    target:  pixel on the bottom or to the right of the red shape
    precondition:
      - pixel is red (color value of 2)
      - the x and y coord of the pixel is described as the rightmost edge of the shape's bounding box and the bottom of its bounding box
    postcondition:
        pixel becomes blue (color value of 1)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The blue pixel appears at locations previously occupied by red pixels at the bottom-right periphery of a contiguous red shape.
