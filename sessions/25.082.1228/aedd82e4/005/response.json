A contiguous block is defined as a group of one or more red pixels that are directly adjacent horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).\n2.  **Determine Target Pixel:** For each contiguous red block, identify the pixel that should be changed to blue (1).\n    *   If the red block contains only one pixel, it becomes blue.\n    *   If the block has a single \"bottom\" row pixel, and a single \"rightmost\" column pixel, make that blue.\n    *   If the block has a connected pixel to the right on any row above, but not directly above, then the pixel to change is on the lowest row, and furthest right.\n\n3.  **Change Pixel Color:** Change the color of the identified target pixel in each block from red (2) to blue (1).
