            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a limited understanding derived from the first example. The subsequent tests reveal inconsistencies and errors. The primary issue is that the code *only* considers the position of the red pixel (2) and modifies the output grid *based solely on that position*. It doesn't correctly map the input red pixel to the output configuration. It seems there is a direct and consistent transformation of the red pixel to output pixel of the correct colors that form a + shape, but only centered at a specific cell. The initial code almost got the center of that + shape right (it is the location of the original red pixel), and it almost places the correct colors in the correct surrounding cells.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* provided examples again, paying close attention to the relationship between the input red pixel and the output pattern. The expected outputs form a \"+\" or cross shape with colors 3,6,7,8, and maybe 0 (difficult to see white).\n2.  **Identify the Center:** It appears the center of the \"+\" shape is directly related to where the input red pixel is. The original code tries to do that, but it's not working for all cases, especially off-center.\n3.  **Consistent Offset:** Determine the consistent offset of the \"+\" shape. This is the core transformation rule, not the current one that tries to compute based on corners and edges.\n4.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Clearly articulate the revised transformation rule in a new natural language program.\n5. **Update the facts:** use a YAML block to represent object properties (location, color) for all four training examples\n\n**Gather Metrics (using visual inspection since I cannot execute code yet):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Red Pixel: (1, 1)\n    *   Expected Output Pattern Center: (1,1) Colors: 3 above, 6 below, 8 left, 7 right, 0 center\n    *   Actual output is all zeros.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Red Pixel: (2, 4)\n    *   Expected Output Pattern Center: (1,3) Colors: 3 above, 6 below, 8 left, 7 right, center is NOT part of the '+' pattern\n    * Actual output is 7 at (2,4)\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Red Pixel: (0, 2)\n    *   Expected Output Pattern Center:(1,2) Colors: 3 above, 6 below, 8 left, 7 right, center is NOT part of the '+' pattern\n    * Actual output: partial match (8,7) adjacent to where red pixel was.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    * Input Red Pixel: (1,3)\n    * Expected Output Pattern Center: (1,3):  Colors: 3 above, 6 below, 8 left, 7 right, center is NOT part of the '+' pattern\n    *   Actual output is all zeros.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
