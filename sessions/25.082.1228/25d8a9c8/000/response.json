The output grids consist primarily of `0` (white) and `5` (gray) values. There appears to be a direct correspondence between rows in the input and rows in the output: each row of the input maps to a corresponding row in the output. The mapping isn't simply replicating the values. The top row of the input becomes all 0s in output, other non-top rows change based on the input top row's colors: if all values in a non-top row of the input is present in the top row, output all 0s, otherwise all 5s.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
