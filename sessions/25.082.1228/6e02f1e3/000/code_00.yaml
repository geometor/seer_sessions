facts:
  - observation: "Input grids are square (same width and height)."
  - observation: "Output grids have the same dimensions as input grids."
  - observation: "Input grids contain digits from 2 to 4."
  - observation: "Output grids contain only digits 0 and 5."
  - object: "Input grid"
    properties:
      - "Contains a variety of single-digit integers representing colors."
      - "Square shape."
  - object: "Output grid"
    properties:
      - "Contains only 0 (white) and 5 (gray)."
      - "Same dimensions as the corresponding input grid."
  - relationship: "The output grid's values are determined by a rule based on the input grid's values."
  - condition: "If the input grid consists of entirely one number, the top row of output grid has all 5's and others are 0."
  - condition: "If the input grid's top-left and bottom-right cells are different, the output grid is a diagonal of 5s from top-left to bottom-right with all other cells as 0."
  - condition: "If the input grid's top-right and bottom-left cells are different, the output grid is a diagonal of 5s from top-right to bottom-left, with all other cells as 0."
