The output grids seem to consist primarily of `0` (white) and `5` (gray) values. The positioning of the `5`s appears to be related to the arrangement of colors in the input, but not in a straightforward geometric way (like mirroring or rotation). There's a conditional element: the presence of `5`s seems linked to whether different numbers appear in specific parts of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
