task_description: |
  The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels.
  The transformation rule involves propagating colors downwards.

objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - name: color
        type: integer (0-9)

  - name: pixel
    properties:
      - name: value
        type: integer
      - name: row
        type: integer
      - name: column
        type: integer
      - name: color
        type: derived (from value)

actions:
  - name: propagate_color
    description:  A color is extended downwards in a column.
    parameters:
      - source_pixel: pixel
      - target_column: column
      - target_value:  single value from the matrix

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are adjacent horizontally and vertically.
  - type: above-below
    description: propagate color extends down

rules:
  - condition: a grid cell is not background(0)
    result: select the cell value
  - condition:  a target cell is background (0)
    result: change target cell value to top-right non-background value, fill rest of cells below.
