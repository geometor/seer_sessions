Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves reflecting the input grid across a horizontal axis positioned just below the input, and then removing the overlapping boundary rows. More simply stated, it's adding a mirrored copy of the input grid below itself. The critical element is recognizing the reflection/mirroring aspect and the position of the mirror plane which splits where the reflection begins.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        - colors: [0, 1]  # white, blue
        - dimensions: variable (rows x cols)
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        - colors: [0, 1] # white, blue
        - dimensions: derived from input_grid

actions:
  - reflection:
      type: geometric transformation
      axis: horizontal, below the last row of input_grid
      details: mirror image of the input grid appended below

relationships:
  - output_grid_contains: input_grid (original)
  - output_grid_contains: reflected_input_grid
  - rows(output_grid) = 2 * rows(input_grid) - 2

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Input:** Get the dimensions (rows and columns) of the input grid.
2.  **Reflect:** Create a mirrored copy of the input grid. This is done by reversing the order of the rows.
3.  **Combine:** Append the mirrored copy to the *bottom* of the original input grid.
4. **return** the combined grid
