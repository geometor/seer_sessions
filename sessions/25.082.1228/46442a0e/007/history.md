The input grid is expanded into a larger grid where both dimensions (rows and columns) are doubled. The output grid is composed of four quadrants:

1.  **Top-Left Quadrant:** This quadrant is identical to the original input grid.
2.  **Top-Right Quadrant:** This quadrant is a horizontally mirrored copy of the input grid (flipped left-to-right).
3.  **Bottom-Left Quadrant:** This quadrant is a vertically mirrored copy of the input grid (flipped top-to-bottom).
4.  **Bottom-Right Quadrant:** This quadrant is a vertically mirrored copy of the Top-Right quadrant, and a horizontally mirrored copy of the Bottom-Left quadrant. Or equivalently, the bottom-right quadrant is constructed by mirroring the top-right quadrant on the x axis and the bottom-left quadrant on the y-axis.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly handled the first two examples but failed on the third. The core concept of mirroring and creating quadrants is valid, but the specific mirroring operation in the bottom-right quadrant seems incorrect. The third example reveals a flaw in how the bottom-right quadrant is generated. It appears to not be a simple vertical reflection of the top-right quadrant. It is crucial to re-evaluate the relationship described between quadrants.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Example 3:** Carefully analyze the input and expected output of the third example to pinpoint the exact transformation rule for the bottom-right quadrant.
2.  **Metric Gathering:** Determine color counts and differences between the expected and generated outputs.
3.  **Fact Documentation:** Document all information in the requested YAML format
4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the re-examination and generated facts, rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation, paying close attention to the bottom-right quadrant.

**Metric Gathering and Detailed Analysis of Example 3:**

Let's use code execution to gather metrics for Example 3, focusing on individual pixel colors.

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is expanded into a larger grid where each dimension (rows and columns) is doubled. The output grid is composed of four quadrants:

1.  **Top-Left Quadrant:** This quadrant is identical to the original input grid.
2.  **Top-Right Quadrant:** This quadrant is a horizontally mirrored copy of the *input grid* (flipped left-to-right).
3.  **Bottom-Left Quadrant:** This quadrant is a vertically mirrored copy of the *input grid* (flipped top-to-bottom).
4.  **Bottom-Right Quadrant:** This quadrant is a horizontally mirrored copy of the *bottom-left quadrant*, which is also a vertically mirrored copy of the *top-right quadrant*. Equivalently, the bottom-right quadrant is constructed by mirroring the *top-left quadrant* on *both* the x and y axes.
