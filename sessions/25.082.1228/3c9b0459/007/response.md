The transformation rule is a diagonal flip (transpose).  For a given input grid, the output grid is created by swapping elements across the main diagonal.  Specifically, the element located at `input[row][col]` in the input grid is moved to the position `output[col][row]` in the output grid.  This is equivalent to transposing the input matrix.
