Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.\n*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions in all provided examples.\n*   The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the grid elements, rather than a change in values.\n*   The rearrangement appears to be a rotation or reflection of some kind, but it's not a simple 90 or 180-degree rotation, nor a basic horizontal or vertical flip. It looks like the grid gets reflected along a diagonal, that goes from down-left up-right.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Specifically, the element at position (row, col) in the input grid is moved to the position (n - 1- col, n-1 -row) in the output grid, where 'n' is the number of rows (which equals to the number of columns).\n\nAnother way: The output grid is generated by swapping the row and column indices, starting from 0, but flipped such that row `i` becomes column `n-1-i` and vice versa.\n"
