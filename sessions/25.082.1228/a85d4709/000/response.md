Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input Grids:** Square grids (3x3) containing digits representing colors (0-9, although only 0 and 5 are present in these examples).
*   **Output Grids:** Square grids (3x3) containing digits, apparently corresponding to colors as well, but different from those in the input. The digits/colors used in the output (2, 3, and 4) are consistent.
*   **Transformation:**  The transformation seems to involve a direct mapping of specific input colors to specific output colors. The position of the colors within the grid seems irrelevant. The size of grid is same for input and output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  **Color Mapping:** For each cell in the input grid:
    *   If the input cell's color is 0 (white), set the corresponding output cell's color to 3 (green).
    *   If the input cell is 5 (gray),
        *   If any vertically adjacent cell is 0 (white), set the output to 2 (red).
        *   If any horizontally adjacent cell is 0 (white), set the output to 4 (yellow).
        *   Otherwise, if any adjacet cell is 5 (grey), set the output to what color corresponding to 0 (white) would be.
3. Return output grid.

Essentially, the output is a constant mapping where every white pixel becomes green. The color of input gray pixels depend on whether the gray pixels have adjaceny of color 0. Horizontally adjacent become yellow and vertically adjacent becomes red, and not adjacent to 0 becomes green.
