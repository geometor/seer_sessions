The results show inconsistencies across all examples, indicating a flawed understanding of the sorting logic. The primary issue seems to be the incorrect application of global frequencies and possibly an issue with how local column properties are handled.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this involves:\n\n1.  **Re-examining the Examples:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair, paying close attention to how elements within each column are reordered.\n2.  **Identifying Local vs. Global Properties:** Determine if the sorting is based purely on global frequencies or if there are column-specific rules.\n3.  **Refining the Sorting Logic:** Update the natural language program to reflect the correct sorting criteria, distinguishing between global and local properties.\n4. **Metrics Gathering:** Create a detailed comparison with color frequencies.\n5. **YAML Documentation** Document findings in a structured format\n6. **NL Program** Describe a new program to test\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis**\n\nLet's get more concrete metrics on the mismatches using code execution.\n\n"
