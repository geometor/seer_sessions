examples:
  - id: 1
    input_objects:
      - object_1: { shape: rectangle, color: 9, position: topleft, size: 1x1 }
      - object_2: { shape: rectangle, color: 9, position: others, size: rest }
    output_objects:
      - object_1: {shape: rectangle, color: 0, position: topleft, size: 2x1}
      - object_2: {shape: rectangle, color: 9, position: others, size: rest}
    transformation:  column_reflection # first column alone
    notes: seems like a partial top-bottom reflection of first column

  - id: 2
    input_objects:
       - object_1: {shape: rectangle, color: 6, position: top_row, size: 1x3}
       - object_2: {shape: rectangle, color: 0, position: middle_row, size: 1x3}
       - object_3: {shape: rectangle, color: mixed, position: bottom_row, size: 1x3, pattern: 6,6,0}
    output_objects:
        - object_1: {shape: modified_rectangle, color: mixed, position: top_row, size: 1x3, pattern: 6,0,0}
        - object_2: {shape: rectangle, position: middle_row, size: 1x3, color: mixed, pattern: 6,0,6}
        - object_3: {shape: modified_rectangle, position: bottom_row, size: 1x3, color: mixed, pattern: 6,0,6}
    transformation: double_diagonal_swap #elements between the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal
    notes: The diagonal transformations are more complex than simple mirroring.

  - id: 3
    input_objects:
      - object_1: { shape: rectangle, color: 0, position: top_left_quadrant, size: 2x2 }
      - object_2: { shape: rectangle, color: 9, position: other, size: rest }
    output_objects:
       - object_1: { shape: rectangle, color: 9, position: top_right_quadrant_and_bottom_row, size: 3x1 and 1x2 }
       - object_2: {shape: rectangle, color: 0, position: top_left_and_middle_left, size: 2x2}
    transformation: vertical_reflection
    notes: Simple vertical reflection.

  - id: 4
    input_objects:
      - object_1: {shape: irregular, color: 2, position: corner_and_edge , size: variable}
      - object_2: {shape: irregular, color: 0, position: corner_and_edge, size: variable}
    output_objects:
      - object_1: {shape: irregular, color: 2, position: corner_and_edge, size: variable}
      - object_2: {shape: irregular, color: 0, position: corner_and_edge, size: variable}
    transformation: single_anti_diagonal_swap
    notes: Only grid[0,2] is swapped with grid[2,0].
