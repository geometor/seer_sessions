            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the information and a plan to address the discrepancies:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code was designed around a few specific transformation patterns observed in the first training example. However, testing against all four examples reveals that the logic is incomplete and incorrectly applies transformations. The strategy needs to shift from trying to identify distinct, named patterns (_column reflection_, _vertical reflection_, etc.) to a more generalized rule that encompasses all observed transformations. It appears there's a consistent element swapping behavior, potentially based on diagonal or anti-diagonal symmetry, but it's not fully captured by any single existing function. The strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Detailed Comparison:** Analyze the pixel-by-pixel differences between the input, expected output, and transformed output for *each* example.\n2.  **Identify the Core Transformation:** Determine the *single, consistent* rule that governs how pixel positions are mapped from input to output, rather than a series of conditional checks.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to reflect this unified rule, abandoning the previous pattern-specific descriptions.\n4.  **Revise Code:** Modify the code to implement the revised, general transformation logic.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**\n\nI'll use code execution to gather the necessary data, which will be crucial for the facts and natural language program. I'll be looking for the index of the changed pixels.\n\n"
