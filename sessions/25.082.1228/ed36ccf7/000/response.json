            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 3x3 grids. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the colored pixels (represented by digits) within the grid. There's a consistent color (digit) that changes its position within the grid, while other elements also shift. It appears to be a rotation or reflection, but a simple 90-degree rotation doesn't fit all cases. A closer look suggests a specific type of reflection or pivoting action. The key seems to be the *relative positions* of non-zero elements. The transformation feels like flipping or inverting certain axes based on which corner has the same elements.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
