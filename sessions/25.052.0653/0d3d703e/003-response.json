            "text": "Okay, I see the issue. My previous code was simply adding 1 to each cell's value and taking the modulo 10. However, the examples show a more complex transformation where different colors are modified differently, some by subtraction, some by addition. The modification amount is dependent on the original color. The provided examples demonstrate that the transformation depends on the initial value in input and a lookup table.\n\nHere's a revised natural language description of the transformation:\n\nThe transformation rule can be described by the following process. For each colored cell  `c` located at coordinate (x,y):\n\n1.  **Identify the original color value:** Determine the integer value (0-9) of the cell in the input grid.\n2.  **Apply a color-specific transformation**:\n    *   If the original color is 1, the output color is 5 (+4).\n    *   If the original color is 2, the output color is 6 (+4).\n    *   If the original color is 3, the output color is 4 (+1).\n    *   If the original color is 4, the output color is 3 (-1).\n    *   If the original color is 5, the output color is 1 (-4).\n    *   If the original color is 6, the output color is 2 (-4).\n    *   If the original color is 8, the output color is 9 (+1).\n    *   If the original color is 9, the output color is 8 (-1).\n3. **Write the new value** Assign the corresponding transformed value to the same location (x, y) in the output grid.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on a color-specific rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    transformation_rules = {\n        1: 5,\n        2: 6,\n        3: 4,\n        4: 3,\n        5: 1,\n        6: 2,\n        8: 9,\n        9: 8\n    }\n\n    for x in range(output_grid.shape[0]):\n        for y in range(output_grid.shape[1]):\n            original_color = input_grid[x, y]\n            if original_color in transformation_rules:\n              output_grid[x, y] = transformation_rules[original_color]\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
