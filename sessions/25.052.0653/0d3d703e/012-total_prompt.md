The transformation rule can be summarized by the following process.
If the input color $c$ is equal to 5, then the new color is $(c + 6) \mod 10$.
If the input color $c$ is equal to 6, then the new color is $(c - 4) \mod 10$.
Otherwise, the new color is $(c + 1) \mod 10$.

if input[x,y] == 5:
  output[x,y] = (input[x,y] + 6) % 10
else if input[x,y] == 6:
  output[x,y] = (input[x,y] - 4)
else:
  output[x,y] = (input[x,y] + 1) % 10

Okay, let's analyze the discrepancies between the expected outputs and the transformed outputs generated by the previous code. The initial hypothesis was:

*   If the input color `c` is 5, the new color is `(c + 6) % 10`.
*   If the input color `c` is 6, the new color is `(c - 4) % 10`.
*   Otherwise, the new color is `(c + 1) % 10`.

However, the test results show inconsistencies. Let's examine each example:

*   **Example 1:** Input 3 should become 4, 1 should become 2, and 2 should become 3. The code produced 4, 2, 3 which is incorrect. It seems like color 2 is incremented by 1, when it should be incremented by 4.

*   **Example 2:** Input 2 should become 6. The code produced 3, which indicates an increment of 1, not 4. 3 becomes 4 and 8 becomes 9, as expected (+1). Color 2 has an incorrect operation.

*   **Example 3:** Input 5 becomes 1 (correct, +6), 8 becomes 9 (correct, +1), and 6 becomes 2 (correct: (6 - 4) % 10 = 2 ). This case aligns with the initial hypothesis.

*   **Example 4:** Input 9 becomes 0 which means we are performing + 1. 4 becomes 5 by adding 1 and 2 becomes 3 (+1). Color 2 has an incorrect operation.

Based on this refined analysis, there is a pattern. The code performs an operation that only applies specifically to color 2.

Here's the revised transformation rule, expressed as a natural language program:

1.  **Identify the color** of each cell in the input grid.
2.  **Apply the following transformation rules:**
    *   If the color is 5, add 6 to it and take the modulo 10 of the result.
    *   If the color is 6, substract 4 to it and take the modulo 10 of the result.
    *   If the color is 2, add 4 to it and take the modulo 10 of the result.
    *   Otherwise, add 1 to the color and take the modulo 10 of the result.
3.  **Place the new color value** in the corresponding cell of the output grid.

```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    for x in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for y in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            if input_grid[x, y] == 5:
                output_grid[x, y] = (input_grid[x, y] + 6) % 10
            elif input_grid[x, y] == 6:
                output_grid[x, y] = (input_grid[x, y] - 4) % 10
            elif input_grid[x,y] == 2:
                output_grid[x,y] = (input_grid[x,y] + 4) % 10
            else:
                output_grid[x, y] = (input_grid[x, y] + 1) % 10
    return output_grid
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
