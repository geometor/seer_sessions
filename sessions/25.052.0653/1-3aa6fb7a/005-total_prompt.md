Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observations**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (2x2 block with one cell removed)
        position: (1,1) & (2,1), (2,2) # Top-left corner of the 'L'
    - object_2:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: Flipped L-shape
        position: (3,4) & (4,5), (4,4)
  output_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: (1,1) & (2,1), (2,2)
    - object_2:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: Flipped L-shape
        position:  (3,4) & (4,5), (4,4)
    - object_3:
      color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (1,2)
    - object_4:
      color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (4,4)
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we identify two azure (color 8) objects. One is an L-shaped object located at the top-left, and the other is a mirrored L-shape on the bottom right.

2.  **Preservation of original objects:** The 2 azure objects in the input are preserved in the output.

3.  **Insertion of New Objects**: Two blue cells are added.
    *   One blue cell (color 1) is placed to the immediate right of the top left azure object.
    *    One blue cell (color 1) is placed to the immediate left of the bottom right azure object.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The input consists of the two original azure objects, and two blue cells are added based on proximity to the azure objects.

```python
"""
The input consists of two azure (color 8) L-shaped objects. The output preserves these objects and adds two blue (color 1) cells. One blue cell is placed immediately to the right of the top-left azure object, and the other is placed immediately to the left of the bottom-right azure object.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
