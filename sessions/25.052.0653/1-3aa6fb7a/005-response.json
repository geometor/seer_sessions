The input consists of three azure objects, and three blue cells are added, one adjacent to each azure object. The placement of the new cell depends on whether the azure object is on the left of the input or on the right.\n\nThis program successfully describes the transformation observed between the provided input and output grids, and it adheres to all specified guidelines.\n"
