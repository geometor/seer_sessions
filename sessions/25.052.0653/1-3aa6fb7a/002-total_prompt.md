Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observations**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (2x2 block with one cell removed)
        position: (1,1) & (2,1), (2,2) # Top-left corner of the 'L'
    - object_2:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: Flipped L-shape
        position: (3,4) & (4,5), (4,4)
  output_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: (1,1) & (2,1), (2,2)
    - object_2:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: Flipped L-shape
        position:  (3,4) & (4,5), (4,4)
    - object_3:
      color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (1,2)
    - object_4:
      color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (4,4)
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we identify two azure (color 8) objects. One is an L-shaped object located at the top-left, and the other is a mirrored L-shape on the bottom right.

2.  **Preservation of original objects:** The 2 azure objects in the input are preserved in the output.

3.  **Insertion of New Objects**: Two blue cells are added.
    *   One blue cell (color 1) is placed to the immediate right of the top left azure object.
    *    One blue cell (color 1) is placed to the immediate left of the bottom right azure object.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The input consists of the two original azure objects, and two blue cells are added based on proximity to the azure objects.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
