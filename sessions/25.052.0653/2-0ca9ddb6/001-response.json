            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.\n\n**Observations and Documentation**\n\nHere's a YAML block summarizing the initial observations:\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  size: 9x9\n  objects:\n    - color: 2 (red)\n      position: (3, 2)\n      shape: single cell\n    - color: 1 (blue)\n      position: (6, 6)\n      shape: single cell\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      position: all other cells\n      shape: background\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: 9x9\n  objects:\n    - color: 2 (red)\n      position: (3, 2)\n      shape: single cell\n    - color: 1 (blue)\n      position: (6, 6)\n      shape: single cell\n    - color: 4 (yellow)\n      position: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)\n      shape: single cells forming a vertical line pattern\n    - color: 7 (orange)\n      position: (5,6), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,6)\n      shape: L shape, single cell\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      position: all other cells\n      shape: background\n```\n\n**Description of the Transformation Rule**\n\nHere's a natural language description of the observed transformation:\n\n1.  **Preservation of Existing Single-Cell Objects:** The single red cell (color 2) at position (3, 2) and the single blue cell (color 1) at position (6, 6) in the input grid are preserved in the output grid at their original positions.\n\n2.  **Introduction of Yellow Cells:** Two yellow cells, color 4. The first is created above the preserved red cell at position (2,2-1) and (4,2-1) which is the row above and a row beneath.\n\n3.  **Introduction of Orange Cells:** Several orange cells, colour 7 are created. These orange cells surround the blue cell on row above, row below and either side.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n1. Copy the red pixel from input (3,2) to output (3,2).\n2. Copy the blue pixel from input(6,6) to output(6,6).\n3. Find the location of the red pixel (3,2).\n4. Add a yellow pixel above and below the red pixel: (2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3).\n5. Locate the blue pixel at (6,6)\n6. Add an orange pixel in all locations where the row number is within the range [5,7] and column is 6, OR column number is within range [5,7] and row number is 6.\n\nThis natural language program describes the \"story\" of the transformation, focusing on the objects, their predicates, and the actions performed on them to achieve the output.\n"
