Copy the azure, red and blue pixels from their location in the input grid to the same location in the output grid.\n2. Find the locations of each of the red pixels.\n3. Add a yellow pixel above and below each red pixel.\n4. Locate each blue pixel.\n5. Add an orange pixel in all locations where the row number is within the range [row-1,row+1] and column is equal to the column of the blue pixel, OR column number is within range [col-1,col+1] and row number is equal to the row of the blue pixel.\n\nThis natural language program captures the essence of the transformation, highlighting the preservation of certain objects and the conditional addition of new objects based on the positions of the original ones.\n"
