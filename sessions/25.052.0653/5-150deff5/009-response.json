This forms the basis of the transformation.\n\n2.  **Change Gray to Azure:** All instances of gray (color 5) are changed to azure (color 8).\n\n3.  **Change central-connected pixels to Red:** Inside the azure areas, if a pixel originally colored gray (5) had four neighbors that were also gray (up, down, left, right, orthogonal), it is changed to red (color 2).\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n* We start with grey (5) pixels forming a shape.\n* We change all the grey pixels to azure (8).\n* Inside azure areas, a red (2) object is created. It is formed only by those pixels that originally had four gray-colored neighbors.\n\nThe same Python code can be reused:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n1.  **Identify the Gray Object:** Locate the contiguous gray (color 5) areas in the input grid.

The resulting red pixels are adjacent to one another and form a connected object (component).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\" Return 4 neighbors of the cell in grid\"\"\"\n\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    if r > 0:\n        neighbors.append((r - 1, c))\n    if r < rows - 1:\n        neighbors.append((r + 1, c))\n    if c > 0:\n        neighbors.append((r, c - 1))\n    if c < cols - 1:\n        neighbors.append((r, c + 1))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the specified rules.\"\"\"\n    \n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # Change all gray (5) to azure (8)\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if output_grid[r, c] == 5:\n                output_grid[r, c] = 8\n\n    # Create a temporary grid to track the original positions of gray pixels\n    temp_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Change central-connected pixels to red (2)\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if temp_grid[r, c] == 5:\n                neighbors = get_neighbors(temp_grid, r, c)\n                # Ensure that we only consider neighbors within the bounds of the grid\n                valid_neighbors = [(nr, nc) for nr, nc in neighbors if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols]\n                neighbor_colors = [temp_grid[nr, nc] for nr, nc in valid_neighbors]\n                if all(color == 5 for color in neighbor_colors) and len(valid_neighbors) == 4:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 2\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
