This object is the primary focus of the transformation.\n\n2.  **Change all Gray to Azure:** For all locations where the original object (gray) was, now all will be azure (color 8).\n\n3.  **Change central-connected pixels to Red:** Inside of the gray object, now azure, there are some locations where a pixel has four neighbors (up, down, left, and right). If that is the case, and it creates a connected component inside the azure shape, change it to red (color 2).\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n* We have a grey (5) shape.\n* We change grey to azure (8)\n* Inside, there is a new red (2) shape formed by the following rule.\n* A pixel becomes red if it has four azure neighbors, and with other red pixels, forms a connected component.\n\n"
