One is an L-shaped object located at the top-left, and the other is a mirrored L-shape on the bottom right.\n\n2.  **Preservation of original objects:** The 2 azure objects in the input are preserved in the output.\n\n3.  **Insertion of New Objects**: Two blue cells are added.\n    *   One blue cell (color 1) is placed to the immediate right of the top left azure object.\n    *    One blue cell (color 1) is placed to the immediate left of the bottom right azure object.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe input consists of the two original azure objects, and two blue cells are added based on proximity to the azure objects.\n"
