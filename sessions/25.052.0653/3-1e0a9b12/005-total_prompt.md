Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Block Summary**

```yaml
observations:
  - input_grid:
      size: 4x4
      objects:
        - color: 0 (white)
          count: 11
          shape: background
        - color: 4 (yellow)
          count: 2
          shape: isolated cells
          positions: [0,1], [2,1]
        - color: 9 (maroon)
          count: 1
          shape: isolated cell
          position: [0,3]
        - color: 6 (magenta)
          count: 1
          shape: isolated cell
          position: [2,2]
        - color: 1 (blue)
          count: 1
          shape: isolated cell
          position: [3,0]
  - output_grid:
      size: 4x4
      objects:
        - color: 0 (white)
          count: 12
          shape: background
        - color: 4 (yellow)
          count: 1
          shape: isolated cells
          positions: [2,1]
        - color: 9 (maroon)
          count: 1
          shape: isolated cell
          position: [3,3]
        - color: 6 (magenta)
          count: 1
          shape: isolated cell
          position: [3,2]
        - color: 1 (blue)
          count: 1
          shape: isolated cell
          position: [3,0]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of single-cell colored objects (1, 4, 6, 9) on a white (0) background.

2.  **Shift Non-Zero Objects Down:** All non-zero colored objects are moved to the last row of the grid.

3.  **Preserve Order if Possible:**
    - The blue object (1) stays in the first column (index 0).
    - The yellow object at the original position [0,1] disappears.
    - The yellow object that was at [2,1] moves to the last row, keeping its horizontal position [3,1].
    - The magenta object (6) moves down to the last row [3,2].
    - The maroon object (9) moves down to the last row [3,3].

4. **Whites stay as background**

In essence, all the non-white single-cell objects move to the last row, maintaining their relative horizontal order, except the yellow object in the first row.

```python
"""
Moves all non-zero single-cell objects to the last row of the grid,
maintaining their relative horizontal order.

    """

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
