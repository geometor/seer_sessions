The input grid also consists of a vertical line of green (3) color.\n\n2.  **Shift Non-Zero Single Objects Down:** All non-zero colored single objects are moved to the last row of the grid.\n\n3.  **Preserve Green Objects and move them:**\n    - The green objects (3) are preserved but the one in the input that was on the position [4,1] is removed and the other two, are moved down by one cell.\n\n4. **Whites stay as background**\n\nIn essence, all the non-white and non-green single-cell objects move to the last row, maintaining their relative horizontal order. The green objects, move down by one cell except the last one that disappears.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nMoves all non-zero single-cell objects to the last row of the grid,\nmaintaining their relative horizontal order.
