Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves identifying a vertical line formed by gray (5) pixels in the input grid. 
A red (2) pixel is placed at the center of a new 3x3 grid, and the rest of the grid is filled with white (0).

    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule:
    1. Find the center of the input grid.
    2. Create a 3x3 output grid filled with white (0).
    3. Place a red (2) pixel at the center of the output grid.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
