"""
The transformation rule creates a 3x3 output grid. The output grid is initialized with all white pixels (0).
Red pixels (2) are placed in a clockwise pattern, skipping one cell between placements. The starting point
and number of skips before the first placement vary depending on the specific input pattern. The presence
of a vertical gray line (5) in the input is a consistent feature, but its direct influence on the red pixel
placement is not deterministic; rather, it seems to act as a contextual clue.
