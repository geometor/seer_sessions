The most relevant object here seems to be the shape formed by the 5 (gray) color.\n\n2.  **Recognize the Shape**\n    *   In the input, the gray (5) cells form a vertical line.\n\n3.  **Center pixel transformation:** For this particular example it seems that the output consist of the a single pixel at the center. The color of this pixel is changed to 2 (red).\n\n4.  **Background:** The rest of the output grid is filled with color 0 (white).\n\n**Step-by-step transformation (Summarized):**\n\n1.  Locate the gray (5) vertical line.\n2.  From the overall input find the center.\n3.  Place a red (2) pixel at the center.\n4.  Fill the rest of the grid with white.\n\n**Improvements for Next Iteration:**\n* Check other examples to see it the dimensions always change to 3x3.\n* Verify if the red pixel is always at the center or if depends on the gray pixel.\n\n"
