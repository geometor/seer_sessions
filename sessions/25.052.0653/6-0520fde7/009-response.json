However, this vertical line doesn't appear to play a significant role on its own, as seen in previous examples.\n\n3.  **Output Grid:**\n\n    *   The output is a 3x3 grid.\n\n4.  **Red Pixel Placement:**\n\n    *   The red pixels appear at positions `[1, 0]` and `[2, 2]`.\n\n    *  Following our clockwise strategy:\n        +  Skip one, place at `(0,1)`\n        +  Skip one, place at `(1,2)`\n        +  Skip one, place at `(2,1)`\n        +  Skip one, place at `(1,0)`\n        +  Skip one, place at `(2,2)`\n        + This sequence would include the positions of the current example if we start skipping just one.\n\n5.  **Background:** The rest of the output grid is filled with color 0 (white).\n\n**Step-by-step transformation (Summarized):**\n\n1.  Create an output 3x3 grid filled with white.\n2. Place two pixels moving clockwise after skipping only one position.\n\n**Final Python code:**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the general rule:\n      Create a 3x3 output grid filled with white (0).\n      Place red pixels (color 2) by moving clockwise and\n      placing red pixels\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a 3x3 output grid filled with white (0)\n    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)\n\n    output_grid[1, 0] = 2\n    output_grid[2, 2] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
