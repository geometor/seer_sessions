"""
1. **Identify the Gray Object:** In the input grid, locate the contiguous gray (color 5) object. This object is the primary focus of the transformation.
2. **Change all Gray to Azure:** For all locations where the original object (gray) was, now all will be azure (color 8).
3. **Change central-connected pixels to Red:** Inside of the gray object, now azure, there are some locations where a pixel has four neighbors (up, down, left, and right). If that is the case, and it creates a connected component inside the azure shape, change it to red (color 2).

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
