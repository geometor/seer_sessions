Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids for the third example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_objects:
  - object_1:
      color: 5 (gray)
      shape: irregular, with disconnected parts and varying widths
      position: spans rows 2-6 and columns 1-6, not uniformly distributed
      size: scattered across multiple rows and columns with gaps
output_objects:
  - object_1:
      color: 8 (azure)
      shape: mirrors the shape of the input gray object, replacing most of the gray areas
      position: occupies the same grid cells as the initial gray object
      size: matches the input gray object's size in respective locations
  - object_2:
      color: 2 (red)
      shape: fills in spaces within the azure object where gray was previously connected on four sides
      position: embedded within the azure object, occupying spaces originally held by gray
      size: forms based on connectivity within the azure object

```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify the Gray Object:** Locate the contiguous gray (color 5) areas in the input grid. This forms the basis of the transformation.

2.  **Change Gray to Azure:** All instances of gray (color 5) are changed to azure (color 8).

3.  **Change central-connected pixels to Red:** Inside the azure areas, if a pixel originally colored gray (5) had four neighbors that were also gray (up, down, left, right, orthogonal), it is changed to red (color 2).

**Step-by-step explanation:**
* We start with grey (5) pixels forming a shape.
* We change all the grey pixels to azure (8).
* Inside azure areas, a red (2) object is created. It is formed only by those pixels that originally had four gray-colored neighbors.

The same Python code can be reused:

```python
"""

The resulting red pixels are adjacent to one another and form a connected object (component).
