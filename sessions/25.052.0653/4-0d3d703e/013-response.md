Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial findings:

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      shape: vertical line
      position: left edge
      count: 3
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: center
      count: 3
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: right edge
      count: 3
output_grid:
  dimensions: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: vertical line
      position: left edge
      count: 3
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: center
      count: 3
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: right edge
      count: 3
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Here's a natural language description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Object Identification**: The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each a different color (maroon, yellow, and red). Each occupies a single column.

2.  **Color Transformation**: Each color in the input is transformed to a different color in the output.
    *   Maroon (9) is transformed to Azure (8).
    *   Yellow (4) is transformed to Green (3).
    *   Red (2) is transformed to Magenta (6).

3.  **Spatial Consistency**: The position and shape of the objects remain consistent. The vertical lines do not change their positions or extents.

**Natural Language program**

The transformation rule can be summarized by the following process.
If the input color $c$ is equal to 2, then the new color is $(c + 4) \mod 10$.
Otherwise, the new color is $(c - 1) \mod 10$.

```
if input[x,y] == 2:
  output[x,y] = (input[x,y] + 4) % 10
else:
  output[x,y] = (input[x,y] - 1) % 10
```
