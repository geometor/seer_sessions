Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial findings:

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: left edge
      count: 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: vertical line
      position: center
      count: 3
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: right edge
      count: 3
output_grid:
  dimensions: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: left edge
      count: 3
    - color: 5 (gray)
      shape: vertical line
      position: center
      count: 3
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: right edge
      count: 3
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Here's a natural language description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Object Identification**: The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each a different color (green, blue, and red). Each occupies a single column.

2.  **Color Transformation**: Each color in the input is transformed to a different color in the output.
    *   Green (3) is transformed to Yellow (4).
    *   Blue (1) is transformed to Gray (5).
    *   Red (2) is transformed to Magenta (6).

3. **Spatial Consistency**: The position and shape of the objects remain consistent. The vertical lines do not change their positions or extents.

**Natural Language program**

The transformation rule can be summarized by the following process. For each colored cell $c$ located at coordinate $(x,y)$, the output cell is defined by adding the integer 1 to the original color value.

```
output[x,y] = input[x,y] + 1
```

```python
"""

output[x,y] = input[x,y] + 1

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """

    """
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Iterate through each cell in the grid.
    for x in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for y in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            # Add 1 to the color value of each cell.
            output_grid[x, y] = (output_grid[x, y] + 1) % 10

    return output_grid
```

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
