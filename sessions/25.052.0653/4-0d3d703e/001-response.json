Each occupies a single column.\n\n2.  **Color Transformation**: Each color in the input is transformed to a different color in the output.\n    *   Green (3) is transformed to Yellow (4).\n    *   Blue (1) is transformed to Gray (5).\n    *   Red (2) is transformed to Magenta (6).\n\n3. **Spatial Consistency**: The position and shape of the objects remain consistent. The vertical lines do not change their positions or extents.\n\n**Natural Language program**\n\nThe transformation rule can be summarized by the following process. For each colored cell $c$ located at coordinate $(x,y)$, the output cell is defined by adding the integer 1 to the original color value.\n\n```\noutput[x,y] = input[x,y] + 1\n```\n"
