Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: two separate 2x1 vertical rectangles
      positions:
        - top-left corner at (1,1)
        - top-left corner at (3,4)
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      positions:
        - all cells not occupied by azure objects

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: two separate 2x1 vertical rectangles
      positions:
        - top-left corner at (1,1)
        - top-left corner at (3,4)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: two single-cell objects
      positions:
         - (2,2)
         - (4,5)
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      positions:
        - all cells not occupied by azure or blue objects
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.  There are two such objects, each a 2x1 vertical rectangle.

2.  **Observe Invariance**: The Azure objects do not change position or shape.

3.  **Add a Blue Pixel**. For each azure (color 8) object:
    *   A blue pixel is added to the direct right of the top cell of the azure object (at the same level)

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation preserves existing azure colored vertical rectangles and adds blue pixels (1) next to each top part of the azure rectangles.
