            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.\n\n**YAML Block: Observations**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  input_grid:\n    - \"Three separate azure (8) objects.\"\n    - \"First object: a horizontal line of length 2 in the first row, fifth and sixth columns.\"\n    - \"Second object: a vertical line of length 2 in the third and fourth rows, third column.\"\n    - \"Third object: a horizontal line of length 2, then a single pixel below and to the right, then a single pixel one extra space to the right, in the last two rows\"\n\n  output_grid:\n    - \"The azure (8) objects remain unchanged.\"\n    - \"A blue (1) pixel appears adjacent to the left of the first azure object.\"\n    - \"A blue (1) pixel appears adjacent to the top of the second azure object.\"\n    - \"A blue (1) pixel appears to the left of the third azure object.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8) colored objects in the input grid.\n2.  **Preserve Objects:** Keep these azure objects unchanged in their original positions in the output grid.\n3.  **Add Blue Pixel (Object 1):** For the first azure object (horizontal line), place a blue (1) pixel directly to the left of the left-most pixel.\n4.  **Add Blue Pixel (Object 2):** For the second azure object (vertical line), place a blue (1) pixel immediately on top of the top-most pixel.\n5.  **Add Blue Pixel (Object 3):** For the third object, place a blue pixel to the left of the left-most pixel.\n\n**Explanation of the \"Story\"**\n\nThe \"story\" for this example is similar to the previous one. Azure objects are identified and preserved. Then, a blue (1) pixel is added next to each of these azure objects, and the order is: left, top, left. The position of the blue pixel depends on the \"shape\" of the object:\n\n*   Horizontal lines: the blue pixel is on the left.\n*   Vertical lines: the blue pixel is on the top.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule preserves three distinct azure (8) objects and adds a blue (1) pixel adjacent to each of them. The rule follows a left, top, left, sequence.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds objects of a specified color in the grid.\n    Returns a list of coordinates (row, col) for each object,\n    where each object is a list of connected pixels of the same color.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= c < grid.shape[1]\n\n    def dfs(r, c, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not is_valid(r, c) or grid[r, c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n\n        # Check adjacent cells (including diagonals for this specific task)\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            dfs(r + dr, c + dc, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(r, c, current_object)\n                objects.append(current_object)\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the rule:\n    1.
