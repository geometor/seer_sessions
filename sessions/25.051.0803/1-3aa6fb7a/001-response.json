If the topmost pixel is at the top border, add a blue pixel on the same column or row.\n4.  **Add Blue Pixel (Object 2):** For the second azure object (horizontal line), place a blue (1) pixel immediately to the left of the left-most pixel of the azure object. If the leftmost pixel is at the left border, add a blue pixel on the same column or row.\n\n**Explanation of the \"Story\"**\n\nThe \"story\" of this transformation is that we have two distinct azure objects. The transformation rule dictates that these azure objects are preserved, and a blue pixel is added as a marker adjacent to a specific point on each of them. The first object gets a blue pixel on top, and the second object gets a blue pixel on its left side. It is as if we added a handle, an extra color.\n\nThis description covers all observed changes and provides a general rule applicable to similar inputs.\n"
