Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 0 (white)
      count: 10
      shape: background
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 2
      positions: [(0, 1), (2, 1)]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 1
      position: [(0, 3)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 1
      position: [(2, 2)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 0)]

output_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 0 (white)
      count: 10
      shape: background
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 2
      positions: [ (2,1), (3, 1)]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 3)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 2)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 0)]
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Here's a natural language description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify non-white pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0).

2.  **Move to Bottom Row:** Move all the non-white pixels to the last row (row 3) of the grid.

3. **Preserve order** The relative horizontal order of the colors in the input must be preserved.

**Natural Language Program**
The program moves all non-white pixels to the last row, preserving the order.
