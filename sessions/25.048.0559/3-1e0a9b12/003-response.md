Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 6x6
  objects:
    - color: 0 (white)
      count: 28
      shape: background
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 3
      positions: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)]
    - color: 7 (orange)
      count: 2
      positions: [(4, 2), (5, 2)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      count: 2
      positions: [(1,3), (4, 3)]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 1
      position: [(0, 5)]

output_grid:
  size: 6x6
  objects:
    - color: 0 (white)
      count: 28
      shape: background
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 3
      positions: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)]
    - color: 7 (orange)
      count: 2
      positions: [(4, 2), (5, 2)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      count: 2
      positions: [(5,3)]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 1
      position: [(5, 5)]
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Here's a natural language description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Rows with same color:** Identify rows that contain all elements of the same color, excluding white (color 0).
2. **Identify unique colors:** For each unique color (excluding 0), find all rows and columns that contain that color.
3. **Move colors to the last row**: Take the colors not in the rows of all equal colors and copy them to the last row, keep the column order.

**Natural Language Program**
The program finds all non-white and non-uniform colors and moves these values to the bottom row, preserving their original order.
