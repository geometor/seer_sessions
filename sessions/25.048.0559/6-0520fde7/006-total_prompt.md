Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x7
  objects:
    blue_objects:
      - positions: [(0,0), (1,1), (2,0), (0,5), (1,5), (1,6)]
      - shape: single_cells
    gray_objects:
      - positions: [(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)]
      - shape: single_cells
    white_objects:
        - positions: remaining cells
        - shape: background
output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    red_object:
      - position: (1,1)
      - shape: single_cell
    white_objects:
        - position: remaining cells
        - shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Significant Columns:** The input grid has a vertical line of gray (color code 5) cells in the 4th column (index 3).

2. **Detect blue cells**: Find the positions of the blue cells (value 1).

2.  **Extract Surrounding Area:** A 3x3 region is extracted from the original grid.

3. **Count blue cells per row around the gray objects**:
    -   First row: Two blue cells to the left and two blue cells to the right.
    - Second row: One blue cells to the left and three blue cells to the right.
    - Third row: One blue cell to the left.

4.  **Determine middle cell**: If there are more blue cells to the right than to the left, paint it red (value 2), otherwise black (value 0).

5.  **Create Output Grid:** Construct a 3x3 output grid and fill all cells with value 0, except the center cell determined in the previous step.

In summary, the transformation extracts a 3x3 subgrid centered around the gray cells, counts related blue cells, and sets the central pixel of the output to red, leaving the rest as background (white).

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x7
  objects:
    blue_objects:
      - positions: [(0,0), (0,1), (0,5), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0), (2,1), (2,5)]

    white_objects:
      - positions: remaining cells
      - shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Significant Columns:** The input grid has a vertical line of gray (color code 5) cells in the 4th column (index 3).

2.  **Extract Surrounding Area:** A 3x3 area around the gray cells is implicitly considered. Although the extraction isn't a direct subgrid copy, the concept of proximity to the gray cells is crucial.

3.  **Count Blue Cells per Column and per Row:**
    *   **Columns:** For each of the three rows, we consider cells to the left, adjacent, and to the right of the gray cells.
        -   Left Column (around input grid column index 2): Two blue cells.
        -   Middle Column (input grid column index 3, the gray cells): No blue cells.
        -   Right Column (around input grid column index 4): One blue cell.
    * **Rows:**
       - Top Row (index 0): More blue cells to the left of the column with value 5 than to the right.
       - Middle Row (index 1): More blue cells to the right of the column with value 5 than to the left.
       - Bottom Row (index 2):  More blue cells to the left of the column with value 5 than to the right.

4.  **Determine Output Grid Cell Values based on blue cells around gray cells:**
      - If, in the input grid, a row around gray cells (value 5) has more blue cells on the left than right, paint a red cell on the left of the output grid.
      -  If, in the input grid, a row around gray cells (value 5) has more blue cells on the right than left, paint a red cell on the right of the output grid.
     
5.  **Create Output Grid:** Construct a 3x3 output grid.  Fill cells with red (2) based on the rule in step 4 and the other one with white cells (0).

In summary, the transformation considers the relative positions of blue cells with respect to the vertical gray line. The output grid indicates, for each row, whether more blue cells were present to the left or the right, creating a red indicator cell.
```python

        if grid[row, j] == 1:
            right_count += 1
    return left_count, right_count

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this third example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x7
  objects:
    blue_objects:
      - positions: [(0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,4), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (2,6)]

      - shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Significant Columns:** The input grid has a vertical line of gray (color code 5) cells in the 4th column (index 3).

2.  **Extract Surrounding Area:** A 3x3 area around the gray cells is implicitly considered, similar to the previous examples. The core logic revolves around the relative positions of blue cells to this gray line.

3. **Count Blue Cells per Row around gray cells:**

    *   **Rows:**
        -   Top Row (index 0): More blue cells to the left (1) of the gray line than to the right (0).
        -   Middle Row (index 1): Equal number of blue cells on both sides, left (2) and right (2).
        -   Bottom Row (index 2):  More blue cells to the left (0) of the gray line than to the right (2).

4.  **Determine Output Grid Cell Values**:
      - If, in the input grid, a row around gray cells (value 5) has more blue cells on the left than right, paint a red cell on the left of the output grid.
      -  If, in the input grid, a row around gray cells (value 5) has more blue cells on the right than left, paint a red cell on the right of the output grid.
      - If the number of blue cells are equal, do nothing (value 0).

5.  **Create Output Grid:** Construct a 3x3 output grid. Fill cells with red (2) based on the comparison of blue cell counts to the left and right of the gray line in each row, as determined in step 4. All other cells in the output grid are filled with white (0).

In summary, the transformation identifies the vertical gray line and uses the distribution of blue cells in each row relative to that line to determine the placement of red cells in the output grid. The code already developed fully implements this behaviour.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # change output pixels
