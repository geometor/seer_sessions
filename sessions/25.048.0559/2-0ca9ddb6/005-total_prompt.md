Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2  # Red
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1  # Blue
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 0 #background
      position: all the other cells

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2  # Red
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1  # Blue
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 4  # Yellow
      positions: [(2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)]
      shape: four single cells forming a cross/plus pattern around the red cell
    - color: 7  # Orange
      positions: [(5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 6)]
      shape: four single cells forming a cross/plus pattern around the blue cell
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Cells:** Locate the single red cell (color 2) and the single blue cell (color 1) in the input grid. These cells remain unchanged in position.

2.  **Construct Cross Patterns:**
    *   Around the red cell, place yellow cells (color 4) in a plus-shaped pattern. Specifically, place yellow cells one position above, below, to the left, and to the right of the red cell. The cells are placed using the coordinate of the original red cell.
    *   Around the blue cell, place orange cells (color 7) in a plus-shaped pattern, using the same way the yellow cells are built around the red cell, described above.

**Step-by-step explanation**
1. Scan the input grid.
2. Find the position of the red pixel.
3. Draw a yellow pixel above, below, left, and right to the red pixel.
4. Find the position of the blue pixel.
5. Draw a orange pixel above, below, left, and right to the blue pixel.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in this second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 8  # Azure
      position: (0, 3)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 2  # Red
      positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]
      shape: single cells
    - color: 1  # Blue
      positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]
      shape: single cells
    - color: 0
      position: all other cells

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 8  # Azure
      position: (0, 3)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 2  # Red
      positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]
      shape: single cells
    - color: 1  # Blue
      positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]
      shape: single cells
    - color: 4  # Yellow
      positions: [(1, 5), (1, 7), (3, 5), (3, 7), (5,0), (5,2), (8,0), (8,2)]
      shape: single cells in cross pattern around red
    - color: 7  # Orange
      positions:  [(2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]
      shape: single cells in cross pattern around blue

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Cells:** Locate all red cells (color 2) and all blue cells (color 1) in the input grid. These cells remain unchanged in position in the output grid. Note any other colors present, but not involved in cross formations (like the azure cell, color 8).

2.  **Construct Cross Patterns:**
    *   Around *each* red cell, place yellow cells (color 4) in a plus-shaped pattern.  Place yellow cells one position above, below, to the left, and to the right of each red cell.
    *   Around *each* blue cell, place orange cells (color 7) in a plus-shaped pattern, in the same way as described above.

**Step-by-step explanation**

1. Scan the entire input grid.
2. Find all the positions of the red pixels.
3. For each red pixel, draw a yellow pixel above, below, left, and right to the red pixel.
4. Find all the positions of the blue pixel.
5. For each blue pixel, draw a orange pixel above, below, left, and right to the blue pixel.
6. Keep pixels that are not of color red or blue.

The provided Python code correctly implements this logic. It iterates through and identifies the red and blue colors and performs the same operations of surrounding them by their respective + shaped colors. It takes into consideration boundary conditions.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
