Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure (8) colored components/objects"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure (8) colored components/objects"
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
      shape: "Two isolated blue (1) colored cells"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One object is located at the top-left composed of a 2x1 form. The other is located at the center-right formed of a 1x2 shape.

2.  **Detect Change:** We notice that in the output grid, two new single, isolated, blue (color 1) pixels, have appeared. These two new pixels, are located inside the white (0) areas, close to the azure (8) objects.

3. **Transformation Rule**
    *   Locate the azure (8) colored objects.
    *   For the object formed by cells (1,1) and (2,1), check if the cell to the right of (1,1) which is (1,2) is white (0). If it is, change it to blue (1).
    * For the other object formed by cells (4,4), (4,5) and (5,4), check if the cell to the bottom of (4,5), which is (5,5), is white (0). If it is, change it to blue (1).

In summary, the transformation paints a blue cell at the specified position if it is available.


*text:*
```python
"""
The transformation identifies azure (8) colored objects in the input grid. 
It then checks for specific white (0) colored cells adjacent to these azure objects.
If the conditions are met, it changes these white cells to blue (1).

Specifically:
- For the azure object at the top-left, it checks the cell to its right.
- For the azure object at the center-right, it checks the cell below the rightmost cell.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
