Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure (8) colored components/objects"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure (8) colored components/objects"
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
      shape: "Two isolated blue (1) colored cells"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One object is located at the top-left composed of a 2x1 form. The other is located at the center-right formed of a 1x2 shape.

2.  **Detect Change:** We notice that in the output grid, two new single, isolated, blue (color 1) pixels, have appeared. These two new pixels, are located inside the white (0) areas, close to the azure (8) objects.

3. **Transformation Rule**
    *   Locate the azure (8) colored objects.
    *   For the object formed by cells (1,1) and (2,1), check if the cell to the right of (1,1) which is (1,2) is white (0). If it is, change it to blue (1).
    * For the other object formed by cells (4,4), (4,5) and (5,4), check if the cell to the bottom of (4,5), which is (5,5), is white (0). If it is, change it to blue (1).

In summary, the transformation paints a blue cell at the specified position if it is available.

```python
"""
The transformation identifies azure (8) colored objects in the input grid. 
It then checks for specific white (0) colored cells adjacent to these azure objects.
If the conditions are met, it changes these white cells to blue (1).

Specifically:
- For the azure object at the top-left, it checks the cell to its right.
- For the azure object at the center-right, it checks the cell below the rightmost cell.

Okay, I'm ready to analyze the second example of transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)]
      shape: "Three separate azure (8) colored components/objects: a 2x1, a corner, and another 2x1 rotated shape."
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)]
      shape: "Three separate azure (8) colored components/objects: a 2x1, a corner, and another 2x1 rotated shape."
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5, 3)]
      shape: "Three isolated blue (1) colored cells."
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can see three distinct azure (color 8) objects. These objects have specific shapes and locations:
    *   A horizontal 2x1 shape at the top-right.
    *   A corner shape in the middle-left.
    *    A vertical 2x1 shape at the bottom.

2.  **Detect Change:** The output grid introduces three new single, isolated, blue (color 1) pixels. These are located in areas adjacent to the azure (8) objects.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   Locate all azure (8) colored objects.
    *   For the 2x1 horizontal object formed by cells (0,4) and (0,5). We check if the cell down of cell (0,4), which is (1,4) is white (0). If it is, change it to blue (1).
    *   For the corner object formed by cells (2,2), (3,2) and (3,3). We check if the cell at the right of (2,2) which is (2,3) is white (0). If it is, change it to blue (1).
    *    For the 2x1 vertical object formed by (5,4) and (6,4). It appears that the cell to the left of (6,4) is checked. If it is white (0), we changed to blue (1).

In summary, the transformation identifies the shape and position of each azure object. Then, it paints a blue cell in an specific position, if this position is available (white cell).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
