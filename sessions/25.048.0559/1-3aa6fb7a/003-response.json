These objects have specific shapes and locations:\n    *   A horizontal 2x1 shape at the top-right.\n    *   A corner shape in the middle-left.\n    *    A vertical 2x1 shape at the bottom.\n\n2.  **Detect Change:** The output grid introduces three new single, isolated, blue (color 1) pixels. These are located in areas adjacent to the azure (8) objects.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   Locate all azure (8) colored objects.\n    *   For the 2x1 horizontal object formed by cells (0,4) and (0,5). We check if the cell down of cell (0,4), which is (1,4) is white (0). If it is, change it to blue (1).\n    *   For the corner object formed by cells (2,2), (3,2) and (3,3). We check if the cell at the right of (2,2) which is (2,3) is white (0). If it is, change it to blue (1).\n    *    For the 2x1 vertical object formed by (5,4) and (6,4). It appears that the cell to the left of (6,4) is checked. If it is white (0), we changed to blue (1).\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies the shape and position of each azure object. Then, it paints a blue cell in an specific position, if this position is available (white cell).\n"
