One object is located at the top-left composed of a 2x1 form. The other is located at the center-right formed of a 1x2 shape.\n\n2.  **Detect Change:** We notice that in the output grid, two new single, isolated, blue (color 1) pixels, have appeared. These two new pixels, are located inside the white (0) areas, close to the azure (8) objects.\n\n3. **Transformation Rule**\n    *   Locate the azure (8) colored objects.\n    *   For the object formed by cells (1,1) and (2,1), check if the cell to the right of (1,1) which is (1,2) is white (0). If it is, change it to blue (1).\n    * For the other object formed by cells (4,4), (4,5) and (5,4), check if the cell to the bottom of (4,5), which is (5,5), is white (0). If it is, change it to blue (1).\n\nIn summary, the transformation paints a blue cell at the specified position if it is available.\n"
