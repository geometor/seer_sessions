Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Input and Output**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule is a color mapping. The shape and the positions remain constant.

1.  **Iterate** through each cell in the input grid.
2.  **Transform** the number `n` in each cell into `(n + 4) % 10`.
3. **Place** the new number into the corresponding cell in the output grid.
