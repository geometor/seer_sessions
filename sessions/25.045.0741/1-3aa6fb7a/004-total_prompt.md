**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation process operates on connected regions of color '8' (azure) within the input grid. For each distinct connected component of '8's, the algorithm identifies a specific cell within that component: the "top-leftmost" cell. This cell is defined as the cell with the smallest row index, and in case of ties, the smallest column index among those with the smallest row index within the component.

Once the top-leftmost cell of a component is located, the algorithm first checks the cell immediately to its right. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and its color in the input grid is '0' (white), then the color of this cell is changed to '1' (blue) in the output grid.

If the cell to the right is not modified (either because it's out of bounds, or its color is not '0'), the algorithm then checks the cell immediately below the top-leftmost cell. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and its color in the input grid is '0', then the color of this cell is changed to '1' in the output grid.

If neither the cell to the right nor the cell below meet the conditions for color change, then no modification is made for that specific connected component. This process is repeated for every connected component of color '8' in the input grid to produce the final output grid.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation process begins by identifying all connected components of color '8' (azure) in the input grid. These components are then ordered. The ordering criterion is based on the top-leftmost cell of each component: components are primarily sorted by the row index of their top-leftmost cell, and secondarily by the column index in case of ties in row indices.

After ordering, the algorithm iterates through the first three connected components in this determined order. For each of these components, starting with its top-leftmost cell, it attempts to modify a neighboring cell. The algorithm first checks the cell immediately to the right. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and its color in the input grid is '0' (white), then the color of this cell is changed to '1' (blue) in the output grid, and the process is stopped for the current component, moving on to the next component (if any, up to the first three).

If the cell to the right is not modified (either because it's out of bounds, or its color is not '0'), the algorithm then checks the cell immediately below the top-leftmost cell. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and its color in the input grid is '0', then the color of this cell is changed to '1' in the output grid, and again, the process stops for the current component.

If neither the cell to the right nor the cell below meet the conditions for color change for a component, no modification is made for that specific component.

This entire process is only applied to the first three connected components of color '8' in the determined order. For the fourth and any subsequent connected components, no transformations are performed. The resulting grid after these operations is the output grid.
