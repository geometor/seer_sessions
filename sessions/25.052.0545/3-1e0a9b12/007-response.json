If a cell is already on the last row, keep it. If moving a cell down would place it on top of another colored cell, the moving cell takes precedence.\n\n**Explanation of why the previous code failed:**\n\nThe previous code was designed to find and move a 2x2 gray square. This approach is incorrect because:\n\n*   It only works for 2x2 squares of a specific color.\n*   It assumes the square is always in the top-left corner.\n*   It doesn't handle other shapes or individual cells.\n* It doens't shift all cells down by one row.\n\nThe examples show a more general \"shift down\" rule that applies to all colored cells, regardless of shape or initial position.\n"
