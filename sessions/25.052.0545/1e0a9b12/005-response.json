We can see that color yellow(4), color orange(7) and color azure(8) remain stacked.\n\n5. **Preserve Column:** The non-white objects stay in their original column.\n\n6.  **Stack Within Columns:** Within each column, objects \"stack\" at the bottom, filling upwards. If a column has a connected vertical line, that line is preserved as a single unit during stacking.\n\n7. **Fill Remaining:** Empty spaces are filled with white.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nMoves objects to the bottom of the grid, preserving vertical stacks and column order, then filling the rest with white.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by moving objects to the bottom, maintaining vertical stacks and column order.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    for col in range(cols):\n        # Extract non-zero elements and their vertical connections\n        column_elements = []\n        i = 0\n        while i < rows:\n            if input_grid[i, col] != 0:\n                start_row = i\n                end_row = i\n                while end_row + 1 < rows and input_grid[end_row + 1, col] == input_grid[start_row, col]:\n                    end_row += 1\n                column_elements.append((input_grid[start_row, col], end_row - start_row + 1))\n                i = end_row + 1\n            else:\n                i += 1\n\n        # Place elements at the bottom of the output column\n        current_row = rows - 1\n        for value, height in reversed(column_elements):\n            output_grid[current_row - height + 1:current_row + 1, col] = value\n            current_row -= height\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
