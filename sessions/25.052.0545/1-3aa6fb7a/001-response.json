In this case they all form either L or inverted L.\n\n3.  **Insert Blue Pixel:** For an azure object, select its leftmost vertical segment. Add a blue pixel (1) to the right of that segment.\n\n**Summary of differences**\n\nThe transformation rule places a blue pixel beside the left side of each azure L.\n"
