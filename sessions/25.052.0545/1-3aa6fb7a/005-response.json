We are interested in L-shapes (including inverted L-shapes).\n\n3.  **Insert Blue Pixel:** For each identified L-shaped azure object, locate the leftmost vertical segment. Add a blue pixel (1) immediately to the right of this segment.\n\n**Summary of differences**\n\nThe transformation rule is identical to the previous example: Find L-shaped azure objects and place a blue pixel to the immediate right of their leftmost vertical segment. The Python code developed previously should correctly handle this example as well.\n"
