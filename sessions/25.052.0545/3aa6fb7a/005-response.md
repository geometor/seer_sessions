Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids for the second example.

**Observations**

**Input Grid:**

*   There are three azure (8) colored objects.
*   The first object is an inverted-L shape composed of three cells in the top-right.
*   The second object is an L-shape composed of three cells in the middle-left.
*   The third object is an inverted-L shape composed of three cells in the bottom, slightly to the right.

**Output Grid:**

*   The three azure (8) colored objects remain unchanged.
*   A new blue (1) colored pixel appears to the right of the leftmost vertical segment of each azure L-shaped object.

**Transformation Rule (Natural Language Program)**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (8) colored objects in the input grid.

2.  **Analyze Shape:** Check the shape of each azure object. We are interested in L-shapes (including inverted L-shapes).

3.  **Insert Blue Pixel:** For each identified L-shaped azure object, locate the leftmost vertical segment. Add a blue pixel (1) immediately to the right of this segment.

**Summary of differences**

The transformation rule is identical to the previous example: Find L-shaped azure objects and place a blue pixel to the immediate right of their leftmost vertical segment. The Python code developed previously should correctly handle this example as well.
