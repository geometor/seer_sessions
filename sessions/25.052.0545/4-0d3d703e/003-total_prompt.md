Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a simple color mapping: each color in the input grid is incremented by 1 to produce the corresponding color in the output grid. The spatial arrangement of the colors remains the same.
"""

    """
    Transforms the input grid by incrementing each color value by 1.

    Args:
    input_grid (numpy.ndarray): The input grid.

    Returns:
    numpy.ndarray: The transformed output grid.

    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
