Okay, let's analyze the transformations and refine the natural language program description.

**Analysis of the Previous Results and Issues**

The previous code had a couple of issues, mainly highlighted by Example 2's failure:

1.  **Incomplete "L" shape:** In Example 2, the yellow "L" shapes around the red object were not fully generated for all instances of red objects. This is because of the condition in line 17. The function, find_object, finds only the first instance of the colour and so only applies the transformation to the first red object it sees. It doesn't check for multiple objects of same type.
2.  **Missing Orange Cross:** In Example 2, there are two blue objects. Again, the `find_object()` function stops at the first blue object.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

Here's a revised natural language program that addresses these observations:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all single-cell red (color 2) objects and all single-cell blue (color 1) objects within the input grid.

2.  **Red Object Transformation:** For *each* red object:
    *   Place yellow (color 4) cells in an "L" shape, like a mirrored "L", at the diagonally adjacent positions around the red cell. Specifically, place a yellow cell above and to the left, above and to the right, below and to the left, and below and to the right.

3.  **Blue Object Transformation:** For *each* blue object:
    *   Place orange (color 7) cells in a "cross" shape around the blue cell. This means placing orange cells directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of the blue cell.

4.   **Other colors:** Any cells that are not the red object or the blue object will stay the same.

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements**

*   **"For each"**: The crucial addition is the emphasis on "for each" red and blue object. The original description implicitly assumed a single instance of each object, which is not always the case.
*   **"L" Shape Clarification**: "like a mirrored L" and specific relative positional descriptions, ensure clearer and more efficient transformation
*   **"Cross" Shape Clarification**: Similarly improved, more detailed shape description.
*   **Handling of Edge Cases**: If an object is on the edge and we add something outside, it might go outside the grid, so there should be boundary checks.

The key improvement is recognizing that there can be *multiple* instances of the red and blue objects, and the transformation needs to be applied to *all* of them independently.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
