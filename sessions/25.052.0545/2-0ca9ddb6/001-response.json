The \"L\" can be thought as a 2x2 square missing a cell.\n    *   One is located at (2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3).\n    *   One cross shape (color 7) is placed around the blue object (6,6) in the output.\n   \n\n3.  **Object Placement Rule:**\n    *    The red object created the top yellow \"L\"\n    *    The blue object is the center of the new orange object.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\nThe single red object in the input gets a yellow object as its \"shadow\".\nThe single blue object in the input gets an orange \"cross\" surrounding it.\n\n"
