Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
  dimensions: (9, 9)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 4
      position: [(2, 1), (2, 3), (4,1), (4,3)]
      shape: L shape x 2
    - color: 7
      position: [(5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(6,7),(7,6)]
      shape: cross
  dimensions: (9, 9)
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation**

1.  **Identify Initial Objects:** In the input grid, we have two single-cell objects: one red (color 2) at position (3, 2) and one blue (color 1) at position (6, 6).

2.  **Introduce New Objects:**
    *   Two yellow (color 4) "L" shapes are introduced. The "L" can be thought as a 2x2 square missing a cell.
    *   One is located at (2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3).
    *   One cross shape (color 7) is placed around the blue object (6,6) in the output.
   

3.  **Object Placement Rule:**
    *    The red object created the top yellow "L"
    *    The blue object is the center of the new orange object.

**Transformation Rule Summary**
The single red object in the input gets a yellow object as its "shadow".
The single blue object in the input gets an orange "cross" surrounding it.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      position: (0, 3)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 2
      position: [(2, 6), (7,1)]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1
      position: [(3, 2), (6,6)]
      shape: single cell
  dimensions: (9, 9)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      position: (0, 3)
      shape: single cell

      position: [(2,2),(3,2),(3,1),(3,3),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(6,7)]
      shape: cross
  dimensions: (9, 9)
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation**

1.  **Identify Initial Objects:** The input grid has:
    *   One azure object (color 8) at (0, 3).
    *   Two red objects (color 2) at (2, 6) and (7, 1).
    *   Two blue objects (color 1) at (3, 2) and (6, 6).

2.  **Introduce New Objects:**
    *   Yellow (color 4) "L" shapes appear near each of the red objects.
    *   Orange crosses (color 7) is placed around each of the blue objects.

3.  **Object Placement Rule:**
    * Each red object gets a yellow "L" placed relative to it. The L's position changes from the first example to this one, keeping the objectness.
    * Each blue object has an orange cross centered on its original location.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

Each single red object in the input gets a yellow "L" shape as its shadow. Each single blue object in the input gets an orange cross shape surrounding it. The azure object remains unchanged.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
