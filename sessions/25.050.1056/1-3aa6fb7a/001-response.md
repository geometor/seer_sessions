Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate azure 'L' shapes, one in the top-left and other on the right"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Same as input"
  - color: 1
    positions: [(4,1), (1,4)]
    shape: "Two, separate, individual blue cells."
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid. In this case, we have two distinct "L" shaped objects.

2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** The azure objects are preserved from input to output.

3. **Detect top left corner and bottom right corner:** The upper-leftmost azure object is in position (1,1) and the bottom right most corner is (4,5).

4.  **Place blue pixels:** Place a blue (color 1) pixel on the corners of the bounding box of the object.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule is as follows:
- The azure colored objects are maintained from the input grid to the output grid.
- A blue pixel is placed in the grid at the top left corner and at the bottom right corner.
