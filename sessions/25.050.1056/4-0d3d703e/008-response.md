Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 5 (gray)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Columns:** The input grid is composed of three distinct vertical lines (columns), each with a unique color (3, 1, and 2).

2.  **Increment Color Value:** For each cell in the grid, increase its color value by a fixed amount:
    *   Green (3) cells become Yellow (4). That is +1.
    *   Blue (1) cells become Gray (5). That is +4.
    *   Red (2) cells become Magenta (6). That is +4.

3.  **Object Transformations**: It seems more adequate to state that the transformation rule adds different numbers to values on *odd* columns than to values on *even* columns:
    * Add +1 to the values of cells on odd columns.
    * Add +4 to the values of cells on even columns.

4. **Preservation of Structure** The general shape and the number of cells are preserved.

**Transformation Rule Summary**
The transformation rule consists of incrementing the color value of each cell by a fixed amount. The amount is determined by the parity of the column's index.

```python
"""

- Add +1 to the values of cells on odd columns.
- Add +4 to the values of cells on even columns.

            else:  # Even column
