This gray object is then transformed in the output grid as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Gray Object:** Locate the contiguous region of color 5 (gray).\n\n2.  **Color Replacement 1 (Azure):** The gray color is changed by the color 8 (Azure).\n\n3.  **Color Replacement 2 (Red):** Change the color from gray to color 2 (red) according to the shape.\n\n4. **Background Preservation:** The background color 0 (white) remains unchanged.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule is to change the gray (5) shape by two sub-shapes of azure (8) and red (2). The background remains untouched.\n"
