Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure "L" shapes, which might represent different objects or a combination
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Same as input.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: single blue pixels.
  dimensions: [7, 7]

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we identify all azure (color 8) colored pixels.

2.  **Locate Single-pixel Objects:** Find two azure objects composed by a single azure element.

3.  **Change color**: From the set, move by one position clockwise the azure pixels and change their colors to blue (color 1).

**Explanation and Justification**

The transformation rule is a simple process. We look for single-pixel objects colored in azure and paint blue the cell next to them following a clockwise path.
