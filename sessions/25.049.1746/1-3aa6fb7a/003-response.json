Then, it changes the color of one neighbor cell to the isolated azure object to blue (color 1). The movement follows a clockwise direction.\nThis description aligns with what's implemented in the Python code. The function `get_neighbors` helps to select the right neighbor and the use of a boolean value `is_single` helps us identify if the azure pixel is part of a bigger object, or if it should be considered for the transformation.\n"
