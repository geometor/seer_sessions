Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: two separate 2x1 rectangles
        positions:
          - (1,1), (2,1) # First rectangle
          - (3,4), (4,4) # Second rectangle
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions: fills the rest of the grid
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: two separate 2x1 rectangles
        positions:
          - (1,1), (2,1) # First rectangle
          - (3,4), (4,4) # Second rectangle
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: two separate 1x1 squares
        positions:
          - (1,2) # Next to the first rectangle
          - (4,3) # next to the second rectangle
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions: fills the rest of the grid
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) colored objects in the input grid. These exist as two separate 2x1 vertical rectangles.

2.  **Determine Placement:** For each azure rectangle, identify its location and dimensions.

3.  **Add Blue Pixels:** For each azure 2x1 rectangle:
    *   If the azure rectangle is in the top left quadrant of the grid add a blue (color 1) pixel to its right.
    *   If the azure rectangle is in the bottom rigth quadrant of the grid add a blue (color 1) pixel to its left.

4. **Maintain the rest:** All other cells in the input grid remain unchanged.

In essence, the transformation rule preserves the azure rectangles and adds a single blue pixel adjacent to specific sides of each azure rectangle based in its position.
