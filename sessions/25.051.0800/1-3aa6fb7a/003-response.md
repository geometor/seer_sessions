Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the second input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: three separate 2x1 rectangles
        positions:
          - (0,4), (0,5) # First rectangle
          - (2,2), (3,2) # Second rectangle
          - (3,3), (6,3) # third rectangle
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions: fills the rest of the grid
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: three separate 2x1 rectangles
        positions:
          - (0,4), (0,5) # First rectangle
          - (2,2), (3,2) # Second rectangle
          - (3,3), (6,3) # third rectangle
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: three separate 1x1 squares
        positions:
          - (1,4) # Next to the first rectangle
          - (2,3) # next to the second rectangle
          - (5,3)
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions: fills the rest of the grid
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) colored objects in the input grid. These exist as three separate 2x1 vertical/horizontal rectangles.

2.  **Determine Placement:** For each azure rectangle, identify its location and dimensions.

3.  **Add Blue Pixels:** For each azure 2x1 rectangle:
    *   If the azure rectangle is in the top right quadrant of the grid add a blue (color 1) pixel to its left. Specifically, the coordinate is calculated as:
        + x: the first row coordinate of the rectangle,
        + y: first column coordinate - 1.
    *   If the azure rectangle is in the top left quadrant of the grid add a blue (color 1) pixel to its right. Specifically, the coordinate is calculated as:
        + x: the first row coordinate of the rectangle,
        + y: first column coordinate + 1.
    * If the azure rectangle is in the bottom rigth quadrant of the grid add a blue (color 1) pixel to its left.
    *   If the azure rectangle is in the bottom left quadrant of the grid, check if the rectangule is at the border of the quadrant. For that, the coordinates must be calculated as:
         + x: the smallest row coordinate of the rectangle - 1,
         + y: first column coordinate.

4.  **Maintain the Rest:** All other cells in the input grid remain unchanged.

In essence, the transformation rule preserves the azure rectangles and adds a single blue pixel adjacent to specific sides of each azure rectangle based in its position, confirming the previously developed natural language description.
