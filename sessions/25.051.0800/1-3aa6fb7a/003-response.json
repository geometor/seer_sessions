These exist as three separate 2x1 vertical/horizontal rectangles.\n\n2.  **Determine Placement:** For each azure rectangle, identify its location and dimensions.\n\n3.  **Add Blue Pixels:** For each azure 2x1 rectangle:\n    *   If the azure rectangle is in the top right quadrant of the grid add a blue (color 1) pixel to its left. Specifically, the coordinate is calculated as:\n        + x: the first row coordinate of the rectangle,\n        + y: first column coordinate - 1.\n    *   If the azure rectangle is in the top left quadrant of the grid add a blue (color 1) pixel to its right. Specifically, the coordinate is calculated as:\n        + x: the first row coordinate of the rectangle,\n        + y: first column coordinate + 1.\n    * If the azure rectangle is in the bottom rigth quadrant of the grid add a blue (color 1) pixel to its left.\n    *   If the azure rectangle is in the bottom left quadrant of the grid, check if the rectangule is at the border of the quadrant. For that, the coordinates must be calculated as:\n         + x: the smallest row coordinate of the rectangle - 1,\n         + y: first column coordinate.\n\n4.  **Maintain the Rest:** All other cells in the input grid remain unchanged.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule preserves the azure rectangles and adds a single blue pixel adjacent to specific sides of each azure rectangle based in its position, confirming the previously developed natural language description.\n"
