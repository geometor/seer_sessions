- task: "Reconstruct 3x3 object with background"
- observations: |
    The output grid is always 3x3.
    The output grid contains a single object and background pixels (0).
    The input grid contains multiple objects, one of which, along with its surrounding 0's, forms the 3x3 output. The output is a reconstruction of one object.
    The object and its surrounding 0 pixels form the output.
    The "background" (0 pixels) is part of the reconstructed object, defining its shape.

- object_selection:
  - criteria: "Forms 3x3 grid with surrounding 0 pixels"
    method: "Identify all objects. For each object, check if it and its immediate neighboring 0 pixels form a 3x3 grid."

- transformations:
    - name: "Reconstruct 3x3 Object"
      inputs: "Input Grid"
      outputs: "3x3 Output Grid"
      steps:
        1: "Find all objects in the input grid."
        2: "Select the object that, combined with neighboring 0 pixels, forms a 3x3 grid."
        3: "Copy the selected object and its 0 pixel frame to a new 3x3 grid."
        4: "Return new output object."
