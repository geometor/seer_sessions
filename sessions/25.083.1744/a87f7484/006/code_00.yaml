  - rule: "The output grid is always a 3x3 grid."
  - rule: "The output grid is extracted from the input grid."
  - object: "Cross"

  - action: "Extraction"
    description: "A 3x3 cross pattern, if found, is extracted from the input grid and becomes the output grid."
  - priority: "If multiple crosses are found, only the first one encountered is returned."
  - search_method: "Iterate through all possible 3x3 subgrids in the input."
  - colors: "Input and output grids can contain colors from 0 to 9."
