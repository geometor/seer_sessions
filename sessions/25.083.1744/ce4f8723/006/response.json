            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code have several shortcomings. While the code correctly identifies the delimiter row and focuses on the section above it, the transformation rules for '0' and '1' are not consistently applied across all examples. The adjacency rule for '0's appears to be too strict (requiring adjacency to *another* '0', rather than any other pixel, to remain a '0'), and the changing of '1' to '3' also appears inconsistent. The primary strategy will involve adjusting the adjacency condition for '0' and double checking the transformation of '1' and carefully checking all examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection, aided by the provided results):**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, comparing the expected output with the transformed output:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 4)\n    *   Delimiter Row: 4\n    *   Pixels Off: 3\n    *   Specifics: (0,2), (1,1) and (1,3) are incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 4)\n    *   Delimiter Row: 4\n    *   Pixels Off: 4\n    *   Specifics: (1,2), (2,0), (2,1) are incorrect, and the code missed one of the transformations from 1 to 3 at (0,3).\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 4)\n    *   Delimiter Row: 4\n    *   Pixels Off: 2\n    *   Specifics: (0,3) and (3,0) are incorrect.\n\n*  **Example 4:**\n    *    Input Shape: (9,4)\n    *    Delimiter Row: 4\n    *    Pixels Off: 6\n    *    Specifics: The code did not transform white to green when isolated from other\nwhites.\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
