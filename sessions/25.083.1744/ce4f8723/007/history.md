"""
1.  **Delimiter:** Locate the row in the input grid where *all* cells are the color yellow (value '4'). This is the delimiter row.
2.  **Active Region:** The section of the grid *above* the delimiter row is the active region. All following operations apply only to this region.
3. **Transformation of 1s**: All blue (value '1') cells change to green (value '3')
4.  **Transformation of 0s:**
    *   If a white (value '0') cell is adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to another white ('0') cell, it *remains* white ('0').
    *   Otherwise the cell changes to green (3)

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code have several shortcomings. While the code correctly identifies the delimiter row and focuses on the section above it, the transformation rules for '0' and '1' are not consistently applied across all examples. The adjacency rule for '0's appears to be too strict (requiring adjacency to *another* '0', rather than any other pixel, to remain a '0'), and the changing of '1' to '3' also appears inconsistent. The primary strategy will involve adjusting the adjacency condition for '0' and double checking the transformation of '1' and carefully checking all examples.

**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection, aided by the provided results):**

Here's a breakdown of each example, comparing the expected output with the transformed output:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (9, 4)
    *   Delimiter Row: 4
    *   Pixels Off: 3
    *   Specifics: (0,2), (1,1) and (1,3) are incorrect.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (9, 4)
    *   Delimiter Row: 4
    *   Pixels Off: 4
    *   Specifics: (1,2), (2,0), (2,1) are incorrect, and the code missed one of the transformations from 1 to 3 at (0,3).

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (9, 4)
    *   Delimiter Row: 4
    *   Pixels Off: 2
    *   Specifics: (0,3) and (3,0) are incorrect.

*  **Example 4:**
    *    Input Shape: (9,4)
    *    Delimiter Row: 4
    *    Pixels Off: 6
    *    Specifics: The code did not transform white to green when isolated from other
whites.

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Delimiter:** Find the row in the input grid where all cells are yellow (4). This is the delimiter row.
2.  **Active Region:** Consider only the portion of the grid *above* the delimiter row.
3.  **Transformation of 1s:** Within the active region, change all blue (1) cells to green (3).
4.  **Transformation of 0s:** Within the active region, if a white (0) cell is *not* adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to *any* other cell of the *same* color (0), change it to green (3). Otherwise, leave it as white (0).

The changes clarify that only cells of the same color impact the transformation of a 0.
