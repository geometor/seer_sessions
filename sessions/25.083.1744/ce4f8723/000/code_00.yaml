facts:
  - observation: Input has two grids, vertically stacked, and separated by a row of "4 4 4 4"
  - object_1: Top input grid
    properties:
      - contains: [0, 1]
      - dimensions: variable, same as output grid
  - object_2: Bottom input grid
    properties:
       - contains: [0,2]
       - purpose: appears to not contribute to the output
  - object_3: Output grid
    properties:
      - contains: [0, 3]
      - dimensions: variable, same as top input grid
  - transformation_rule: |
      Map the value of top grid cell to new value:
         1 -> 3
         0 -> 0
      The bottom input grid is discarded
