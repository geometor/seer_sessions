The top grid contains the digit `1` and `0`, and the bottom grid presents the digits `2` and `0`.\n*   The output grid appears to be derived *only* from the *top* input grid. The bottom section of the input grid is completely ignored.\n*   The output grid has the same dimensions as the top section of the input grid.\n*   All `1`s in the top input grid are changed to `3`s in the output grid.\n*   `0` in the top input grid remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts**\n\n"
