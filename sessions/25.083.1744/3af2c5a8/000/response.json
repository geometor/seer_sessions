The input grids are transformed into output grids that appear to be expanded versions of the input. The core transformation seems to involve replicating the input grid both horizontally and vertically, creating a larger grid.  The replication factor isn't immediately obvious, and needs to be inferred. There seems to be an interaction between original cell values and their values on the border or duplication.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
