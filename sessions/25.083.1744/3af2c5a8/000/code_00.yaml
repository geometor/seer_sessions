facts:
  - observation: Input grids are smaller than output grids.
  - observation: Output grids appear to be composed of repetitions of the input grid.
  - observation: Colors in the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
  - observation: Input grid in train_1 is 3x4 (height x width).
  - observation: Output grid in train_1 is 6x8 (height x width).
  - observation: Input grid in train_2 is 3x4.
  - observation: Output grid in train_2 is 6x8.
  - observation: Input grid in train_3 is 3x4.
  - observation: Output grid in train_3 is 6x8.
  - relationship: Output grid dimensions are double the input grid dimensions (both height and width).
  - action: Replication of input grid content to form the output grid.
  - object_property: Cell values (colors) remain consistent during replication.
