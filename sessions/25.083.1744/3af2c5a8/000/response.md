Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The input grids are transformed into output grids that appear to be expanded versions of the input. The core transformation seems to involve replicating the input grid both horizontally and vertically, creating a larger grid.  The replication factor isn't immediately obvious, and needs to be inferred. There seems to be an interaction between original cell values and their values on the border or duplication.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are smaller than output grids.
  - observation: Output grids appear to be composed of repetitions of the input grid.
  - observation: Colors in the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
  - observation: Input grid in train_1 is 3x4 (height x width).
  - observation: Output grid in train_1 is 6x8 (height x width).
  - observation: Input grid in train_2 is 3x4.
  - observation: Output grid in train_2 is 6x8.
  - observation: Input grid in train_3 is 3x4.
  - observation: Output grid in train_3 is 6x8.
  - relationship: Output grid dimensions are double the input grid dimensions (both height and width).
  - action: Replication of input grid content to form the output grid.
  - object_property: Cell values (colors) remain consistent during replication.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Dimensions:** Measure the height and width of the input grid.
2.  **Double Dimensions:** Multiply both the height and width by two to get the dimensions of the output grid.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, blank grid with the doubled dimensions.
4.  **Replicate Input:** Copy the input grid into the top-left quadrant of the output grid.
5.  **Mirror Horizontally:** Copy the top-left quadrant to the top-right quadrant, effectively mirroring the input grid horizontally.
6.  **Mirror Vertically:** Copy both top quadrants to the bottom two quadrants mirroring vertically. The entire input is now replicated four times to create output.
