examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_objects:
      - object_id: grid_1
        type: grid
        dimensions: 3x4
        colors: [0, 3]
    output_objects:
      - object_id: grid_2
        type: grid
        dimensions: 6x8
        colors: [0, 3]
    transformations:
      - type: replication
        pattern: |
          The input grid is replicated in a 2x2 pattern, but the top-right and bottom-left quadrants
          are *copies* of the top-left (original) quadrant, whereas the bottom-right is a copy of the top-left.
          The upper-right is *not* a simple horizontal flip.

  - example_id: 2
    input_objects:
      - object_id: grid_1
        type: grid
        dimensions: 3x4
        colors: [0, 8]
    output_objects:
      - object_id: grid_2
        type: grid
        dimensions: 6x8
        colors: [0, 8]
    transformations:
      - type: replication
        pattern: |
          The input grid is replicated in a 2x2 pattern. The copies are direct replications of the original.

    transformations:
      - type: replication
        pattern: |
            The input grid is replicated in a 2 x 2 pattern.
