While it correctly handled the second example, it failed on the first and third. The consistent \"Pixels Off: 12\" in the failing cases, along with correct size, color palette, and color count, strongly suggests the *general idea* of replication is correct, but the *specific type* of replication is wrong. It's not a simple mirroring. The strategy should be to:\n\n1.  **Carefully re-examine the input-output pairs:** Focus on the exact placement of pixels, not just the overall doubling of dimensions. We need to discern the *precise* replication rule.\n2.  **Identify the correct replication/tiling pattern:** It's likely a form of tiling or repeating the input grid, but not simple horizontal and vertical mirroring.\n3.  **Update the natural language program:** Once the precise pattern is understood, describe it clearly and concisely.\n4.  **Refine the code based on improved description**\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary):**\n\nWe will execute code to derive some relationships in the examples to help expose the transform.\n\n"
