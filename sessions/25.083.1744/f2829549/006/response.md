Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was a good starting point, but it's not entirely accurate across all examples. The core issue is in the `_transform_pixels` function. It correctly replaces orange (7) with green (3), but incorrectly sets all other pixels to white (0). The examples show that the structure of where 7's are located is generally preserved, but in the locations of 7s it is replaced by a 3. All other positions in the first three columns should be 0.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Pixel Differences:** We need to identify the specific pixels that differ between the expected output and the transformed output. We may also need to re-examine the task specifications.
2.  **Refine Transformation Logic:** Based on the pixel differences, we can pinpoint where the current logic is failing.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program for clarity and correctness.
4. Verify that the updated program is compatible with the current python code.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's use python to gather some metrics and highlight specific areas of concern.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Extract Subgrid:** From the input grid, extract a subgrid comprising the first three columns (columns 0, 1, and 2).
2.  **Transform Pixels:** Within this subgrid, replace all orange pixels (value 7) with green pixels (value 3). Set all other pixels within the subgrid to white (value 0).
3.  **Reverse Rows:** Reverse the order of the rows of the transformed subgrid. The result is the output grid.
