facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions (2x height and 2x width).
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves a more complex relationship than simple pixel expansion.
  - observation: |
      The colors in the output grid are a subset of the colors in the input grid.
  - observation: |
    The arrangement appears to follow a mirrored pattern, but not consistent across different regions of the grid.
  - observation: example_1: |
      Input upper-left 2x2:  [[2, 5], [2, 6]].
      Output 2x2 blocks appear to be based on transformations and reflections of the input's corresponding values.
  - hypothesis: |
      The transformation involves creating 2x2 blocks in the output based on potentially mirrored/rotated versions of 2x2 sections of the input.
