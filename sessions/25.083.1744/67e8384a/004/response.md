Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a misunderstanding of the transformation. It correctly identified the 2x2 expansion but incorrectly applied reflections, leading to consistent mismatches in the output. The code expands each pixel in the input grid into a 2x2 block, and then attempts a flawed reflection, resulting in the output rows being identical. The code's logic needs to be revised to precisely place each original cell within the context of a mirrored quadrant.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct the Reflection Logic:** The core issue is the incorrect reflection logic. Instead of generating the 2x2 sub-grid independently, the code must treat each pixel as a seed and replicate it correctly into a mirrored quadrant to create a correct 2x2 expansion.
2. **Use Metrics to Guide Revision:** Examine the pixel mismatches and the structure of the incorrect output to determine if we need to flip, translate, or use some other transform.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the corrected code against all examples and repeat the analysis and refinement process if needed.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's gather metrics about the color occurrences in inputs and expected outputs to see if the colors and counts of those colors stay the same from input to output.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - description: "Each pixel in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output grid."
  - observation: "The output grid is twice the height and twice the width of the input grid."
  - color_counts: "The count of each color in the output grid is exactly four times its count in the input grid."
  - object_interaction: "Each pixel (object) from input becomes 4 pixels of the same value in the output"
  - spatial_relation: "The expansion seems to follow a quadrant and mirroring pattern"
  - quadrants: "Each expanded pixel in the output grid exists in the top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right positions relative to where a single pixel of that value appears in the input"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is twice the height and twice the width of the input grid.
2.  **Expansion:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   Replicate the pixel's value into a 2x2 block in the output grid. The original pixel position corresponds to the top-left cell of the 2x2 block.
    *   The pixel directly to the right in the output grid is the same as the current pixel.
    *   The pixel directly below in the output grid is the same as the current pixel.
    *   The pixel diagonal and down to the right of the current pixel in the output grid is the same as the current pixel.

In essence, the transformation takes each input pixel and creates a 2x2 square of the same color in the output grid.
