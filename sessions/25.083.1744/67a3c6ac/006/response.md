Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program assumed a simple swapping of elements based on symmetry around the center of the grid. While this concept is partially correct, the results indicate a flaw in its execution. The code swaps *every* element with its symmetric counterpart, leading to double-swapping and, effectively, often returning a grid close to the original input.  The errors are not random; the output grids resemble flipped versions of the expected outputs, showing the symmetry logic is active but misapplied. The strategy should be adjusted to correctly implement the symmetrical mirroring.

**Gather Metrics and Analysis (using a more systematic approach):**

To better understand the error, let's focus on what is done correctly and incorrectly by examining differences between symmetric pairs.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_swap_errors(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_array = np.array(expected_output)
    transformed_array = np.array(transformed_output)

    rows, cols = input_array.shape
    errors = 0
    correct_swaps = 0
    incorrect_swaps = 0

    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            sym_i = rows - 1 - i
            sym_j = cols - 1 - j

            #check only upper triangle to prevent double counting
            if (i<sym_i) or (i==sym_i and j < sym_j):

                if expected_array[i,j] == input_array[sym_i, sym_j] and expected_array[sym_i, sym_j] == input_array[i, j]:
                    correct_swaps += 1
                else:
                    incorrect_swaps += 1


            if transformed_array[i, j] != expected_array[i, j]:
                errors += 1

    print(f"  Errors: {errors}")
    print(f"Correct Swaps: {correct_swaps}")
    print(f"Incorrect Swaps: {incorrect_swaps}")

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Grid Dimensions:** Determine the number of rows and columns in the input grid.
2.  **Center:** Conceptually, identify the center of the grid.
3.  **Symmetric Swap (Conditional):** For each cell in the grid, identify its symmetrically opposite cell across the center. A cell at position (i, j) has the symmetric opposite at (rows - 1 - i, cols - 1 - j).  *Only* perform a swap if the original cell's value is different to the expected value of the symmetrically opposite cell. Critically, after performing a swap, do not swap the elements back. This prevents the double-swapping error. This can be achieved by only iterating through one "half" of the grid (e.g. for elements where the row index `i` is strictly less than `rows - 1 - i`. If `i` is equal to `rows-1-i`, consider elements where the col index `j` is strictly less than `cols-1-j`).
