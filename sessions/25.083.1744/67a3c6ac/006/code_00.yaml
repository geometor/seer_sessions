observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - rows: variable
      - columns: variable
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    transformations:
      - type: element_swap
        description: Elements are swapped with their symmetric counterparts across the center of the grid.
        details: The initial implementation incorrectly swaps all symmetric pairs, including those already swapped.
