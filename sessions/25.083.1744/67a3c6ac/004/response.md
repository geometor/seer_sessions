Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis (rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then reverse each column) is incorrect. The transformed outputs don't match the expected outputs in any of the three examples, although the size and color palette are correct. This suggests the core transformation logic needs significant adjustment. The strategy will be to:

1.  Carefully examine each input-output pair to identify visual patterns.
2.  Focus on the relationships between object positions and colors.
3.  Reformulate a natural language program to be more accurate and test it.
4.  Iteratively refine program until all training data is matched

**Gather Metrics (using visual inspection since I have no code execution capability in this turn):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 7x7
    *   Output Shape: 7x7
    *   Pixel Differences: High (35 pixels)
    *   Observations:
        *   The input and output shapes are the same
        *   Visual inspection shows a kind of swirling inward of elements
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 4x4
    *   Output Shape: 4x4
    *   Pixel Differences: Medium (13 pixels)
    *   Observations:
        *   The input and output shapes are the same.
        *   It almost looks like a reflection across some axis, but not a simple one.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 6x6
    *   Output Shape: 6x6
    *   Pixel Differences: High (28 pixels)
     *   Observations:
        *   The input and output shapes are the same.
        *   Again a reflection or more complex re-arrangement is evident.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
example_1:
  input_shape: [7, 7]
  output_shape: [7, 7]
  objects:
      - color_blocks: Identified by distinct colors (1, 2, 6, 7)
  transformations:
      - positional_changes: Complex rearrangement of color blocks, not a simple rotation or reflection.
  invariants:
    - output_shape: same as input shape
example_2:
  input_shape: [4, 4]
  output_shape: [4, 4]
  objects:
    - color_blocks: Identified by distinct colors (1, 2, 6, 7)
  transformations:
    - positional_changes:  Rearrangement, possibly a complex reflection or combination of transformations.
  invariants:
      - output_shape: same as input shape
example_3:
  input_shape: [6, 6]
  output_shape: [6, 6]
  objects:
    - color_blocks: Identified by distinct colors (1, 2, 6, 7)
  transformations:
    - positional_changes: Complex rearrangement - not a simple rotation, reflection, or column flip.
  invariants:
    - output_shape: same as input shape

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation involves a complex rearrangement of the colored pixels within the grid. The dimensions of the grid remain constant. The transformation doesn't correspond to a simple rotation or reflection. Consider the input grid as a collection of colored blocks. The transformation rearranges these blocks while preserving the overall grid dimensions. It seems like the blocks "swirl" inwards or move in relation to each other. The colors are maintained during rearrangement. It appears to exchange corresponding elements from diagonally opposed corners. The elements along the main diagonal and anti-diagonal appear to swap positions.

Revised Natural Language Program:

1.  The grid maintains its original dimensions.
2.  Elements in symmetrical position with center point, swap. The new position is a reflection of the initial position across the center point.
