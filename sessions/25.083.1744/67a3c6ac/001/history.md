Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example pair, but dimensions vary between different pairs.
*   The transformation appears to involve a systematic swapping or rearrangement of pixel colors within the grid. It's not a simple rotation, reflection, or color substitution. It seems like the *positions* of colors are being remapped.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions for each example.
  - observation: The set of colors present in the input grid is the same as the set of colors in the output grid, but their positions are rearranged.
  - observation: The transformation isn't a simple geometric operation like rotation or reflection.
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: (rows, columns)
      - elements: 2D array of integers (0-9)
    actions:
      - color_remapping:  The positions of colors are changed according to a specific rule.
  - relationship: Input grid transforms to output grid via color_remapping.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Observe the input grid.
2.  Observe the output grid.
3. Notice that the grids have the same dimensions
4.  The transformation rule appears to involve swapping the positions of the digits based on their original locations, reading digits from left to right.

In the first pair, the digits in input are transposed and reversed.
7 7 7 6 6 6 2 -> 2 6 6 6 7 7 7
6 7 1 1 7 7 1 -> 1 7 7 1 1 7 6
7 7 2 1 2 6 6 -> 6 6 2 1 2 7 7
2 2 7 7 7 2 2 -> 2 2 7 7 7 2 2
7 2 7 1 2 7 2 -> 2 7 2 1 7 2 7
6 6 6 2 2 1 1 -> 1 1 2 2 6 6 6
6 2 6 6 6 6 6 -> 6 6 6 6 6 2 6

The output grid seems to follow a pattern: read the input grid from left to right. The first line of the output comes from reversing the first row, the 2nd line from reversing the 2nd line etc.

The transformation swaps the rows and the columns and also reverses the order.

This program assumes that the input grid is transposed and each line reversed to create the output grid.
