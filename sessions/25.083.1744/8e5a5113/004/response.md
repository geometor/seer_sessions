Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation description:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were on the right track, identifying the mirroring concept around a column of '5's. However, the code has a couple of crucial flaws that the test results highlight:

1.  **Incorrect Mirroring Range:** The mirroring logic in the code only mirrors up to `2*mirror_col+1` which is not the whole output grid. This assumes output grid width is known. It should mirror up to the width of original input.
2.  **Incorrect Mirror Content:** The mirror uses index `mirror_col - k`. It assumes the mirror is perfect - the content will fit exactly into the right side. It did not consider it may overwrite data when the right side is shorter.

The strategy to fix this is:

1.  **Dynamic Output Width:** Determine the correct output size based on the mirroring. The section after second `5` is not modified and appended to the mirrored output.
2.  **Precise Mirroring:** compute the mirrored part based on existing columns to the right of `5`.

**Metrics and Observations (using code for precision):**

I'll use code to analyze each example and pinpoint exact issues, then summarize in a YAML block.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find the Mirror Columns:** Locate the first and second vertical columns in the input grid where all cells are gray (value 5).
2.  **Determine Sections:** Divide the input grid into three sections:
    *   Left: Everything to the left of the *first* gray column.
    *   Middle: Everything between the first and second gray columns.
    *   Right: Everything to the right of the *second* gray column.
3.  **Mirror the Left Section:** Mirror the Left section across the *first* gray column, creating a mirrored image to its right. This replaces the part of the Middle section. The length of the mirrored part equals to the number of columns between the two `5` columns.
4.  **Preserve:** Copy the Right section.
5. **Construct:** Concatenate the original `left`, the `first 5 column`, the `mirrored section`, the `second 5 column`, the original `right` sections to create the output.
