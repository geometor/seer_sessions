            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were based on a flawed understanding of the mirroring process. The code attempts an interleaving approach, which is incorrect. The errors in all three examples show that the mirroring is not happening as intended. The core issue is how the columns to the right of the mirror column ('5') are populated. Instead of a direct, column-by-column reflection, the code tries a more complex, and ultimately wrong, alternating placement.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct the Mirroring Logic:** The primary focus should be on fixing the way the right side of the output grid is constructed. The correct approach is a simple, direct reflection of the left side onto the right side, using the '5' column as the axis of symmetry.\n2.  **Re-evaluate Interleaving:** The initial assumption of interleaving columns should be discarded.\n3.  **Simplify the Code:** The current code is more complex than necessary. The corrected logic should lead to a simpler and more readable implementation.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo understand the errors better, let's analyze each example pair. I'll use python code execution to compute distances and differences between expected and transformed grids.\n\n"
