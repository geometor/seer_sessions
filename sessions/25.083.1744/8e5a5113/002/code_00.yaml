facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the initial state. Contains a vertical line of '5's (gray pixels) serving as a mirror.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the transformed state. It's a mirrored version of the input_grid.
  - property: mirror_column
    value: Column index containing all '5's.
    description: Acts as the axis of reflection.
  - action: reflection
    description: The left side of the input_grid (excluding the mirror column) is reflected onto the right side of the output_grid. The reflection is performed column-wise. The portion of the grid that is left to the vertical line of 5s, is mirrored to the other part, taking the vertical 5s line as an axis.
  - observation: input_output_width
    description: In all training samples, the input and output grids have the same width and height.
  - observation: column_symmetry
    description: The number of columns to be mirrored seems to be equal on both sides of the '5' column.
