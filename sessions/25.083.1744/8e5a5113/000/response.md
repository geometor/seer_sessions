Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid of the same dimensions. The most prominent feature is a vertical line of '5' (gray) pixels dividing each input grid into two regions. The output grid seems to be a mirrored or reflected version of the left side of the input grid, using the gray '5' column as the axis of reflection and expanding into the all white area. It also seems the left and the mirrored right sections interweave each other around the column of '5'.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain a vertical line of '5' (gray) pixels.
  - observation: |
      The area to the right of the '5' line in the input is all '0' (white).
  - observation: |
      The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input.
  - observation: |
      Pixels to the left of '5's are mirrored to right, but interweaving.
  - relationship: |
      The column of '5's acts as a mirror, influencing the values on its right.
  - action: |
      Mirror operation from left to right, with interleaving columns.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Mirror:** Locate the vertical column of '5' (gray) pixels in the input grid. This serves as the axis of reflection.
2.  **Mirror with Interleaving**: For each row, copy pixel from the left part and the mirrored pixel from right part alternatively, starting from the column of '5's.

In simpler terms, the transformation takes the left side of the input grid (everything left of the gray '5' column) and mirrors/reflects it onto the right side of the output grid in an interleaving way, using the '5' column as the mirroring axis.
