The most prominent feature is a vertical line of '5' (gray) pixels dividing each input grid into two regions. The output grid seems to be a mirrored or reflected version of the left side of the input grid, using the gray '5' column as the axis of reflection and expanding into the all white area. It also seems the left and the mirrored right sections interweave each other around the column of '5'.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
