objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D array
      description: Initial grid of integers.
      properties:
        rows: Number of rows in the input grid.
        cols: Number of columns in the input grid.
        cells: Individual elements within the grid, represented by integers (colors).
        non_zero_cells: cells with a value other than 0.
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D array
      description: Resultant grid after transformation.
      properties:
        rows: Number of rows in the output grid.
        cols: Number of columns in the output grid.
        cells: Individual elements within the grid.

actions:
  - replicate:
      description: The input grid pattern is copied multiple times.
  - expand:
      description: The output grid is larger than the input grid.
  - alternate:
    description: Non-zero elements seem to alternate their positions
    with a copy of the input grid as rows or columns are added

relationships:
  - input_output_dimension_relation: Output grid dimensions are multiples of the input grid dimensions. Specifically, output rows = 2 * input rows and output cols = 2 * input cols
  - cell_value_preservation: Non-zero cell values from the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
  - positional_mapping:  The relative positions of non-zero elements in the input are important for their output positions.
