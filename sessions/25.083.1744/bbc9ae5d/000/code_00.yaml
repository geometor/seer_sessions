objects:
  - type: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 1 x N (where N is the number of columns)
      elements:  list of integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: M x N (where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns)
      elements: list of integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: non_zero_sequence
    properties:
      description: contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels at the beginning of the input grid
      length: variable
  - type: zero_sequence
    properties:
      description: contiguous sequence of zero pixels following the non-zero sequence
      length: variable

actions:
  - name: replicate_non_zero_sequence_horizontally
    description: The non-zero sequence from the input is extended by appending copies of itself.
    parameters:
      repetition_count:  The number of times the original sequence appears is increased
  - name: replicate_rows_vertically
    description: New rows are added to the output grid, containing the expanded non-zero sequence.
    parameters:
      row_count: The number of output rows.

relationships:
  - type: input_output
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid.
  - type: sequence_expansion
    description: The non-zero sequence's length in the output grid is a multiple of its original length in the input.
  - type: row_creation
    description:  The output grid has multiple rows derived from the expanded non-zero sequence and original zeros.
  - type: row_count_and_sequence_length
    description: The number of rows in output equal to number of non-zero elements plus one.
