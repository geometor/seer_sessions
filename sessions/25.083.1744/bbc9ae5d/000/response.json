            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a single-row grid (input) into a multi-row grid (output).  The key feature seems to be the repetition of a sequence of non-zero colored pixels from the input. The repetition extends both in number of pixels and in the creation of new rows.  The zero-valued pixels (white) seem to act as a kind of \"background\" or \"delimiter\" and are not replicated in the same way as the non-zero pixels. The number of times the initial non-zero colored pixels are repeated, and the number of rows created, appear to be related.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

The output row count will be equal to the number of non zero elements + 1.\n3. **Horizontal Expansion:** in each output row, append a copy of the input non-zero color elements. The number of additional copies of non-zero elements to append to each output row is equal to the number of output rows minus 1.\n4. **Vertical Replication:** create new rows, replicating the horizontally expanded sequence from step 3. The number of rows equals the value determined in step 2.\n5. **Append the Zero Sequence:** maintain original zero sequence from the input row to the output row(s).\n\nIn simpler terms: The initial colored pixels in the input are repeated to form a longer sequence. This extended sequence is then used to create multiple rows, resulting in a rectangular output grid. The zero's at the end of the input is maintained. The number of output rows generated is dependent on number of colored pixels in input.\n"
