Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program description of the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input grids appear to be composed of two distinct sections, separated by a horizontal band of '4' (yellow). The top section contains '7' (orange) and '0' (white), while the bottom section contains '2' (red) and '0' (white).
*   The output grids consist only of '3' (green) and '0' (white).
*   The output grids seem to be related to the upper portion of input, specifically the 7s.
*	  The lower section (with 2s) appears to be discarded or ignored in the transformation.
*   The size of output grid is smaller than the input grid, the divider (4s)
    is not present in the output

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids are divided into two regions by a horizontal line of '4' (yellow).
  - observation: |
      The upper region contains '7' (orange) and '0' (white).
  - observation: |
      The lower region contains '2' (red) and '0' (white).
  - observation: |
      Output grids contain only '3' (green) and '0' (white).
  - observation: |
     Output is the upper section, with 7s replaced by 3s.
  - relationship: |
      The '7' (orange) pixels in the upper region of the input are replaced by '3' (green) pixels in the output.
  - relationship: |
      The lower section is entirely removed.
  - property: Input grid height is variable.
  - property: Input grid width is variable.
  - property: Output grid height is smaller then the input height.
  - property: Output grid width is equal to input width.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Divider:** Locate the horizontal line of '4' (yellow) pixels that divides the input grid.
2.  **Discard Lower Section:** Ignore all pixels below the divider.
3.  **Extract:** Consider only the section above the divider.
4.  **Substitute:** Within the extracted upper section, replace all instances of '7' (orange) with '3' (green).
5. **Output** The result of the substitution is the output grid.
