If no such row exists, the transformation cannot be applied (return empty output).\n\n2.  **Extract Upper Section:** Create a new grid containing all rows above the divider row. This is the \"upper section\".\n\n3.  **Conditional Color Substitution:** Within the upper section, identify contiguous objects made up of orange (color 7) pixels. Change *some* of these orange pixels to green (color 3) based on their position, *not all* of them. The rule is not clear, but is dependent on x and y coordinates in the upper section before rotation. The precise positions that get converted needs to be better modeled.\n\n4. **Rotate:** Rotate the modified upper section grid by 90 degrees anti-clockwise.\n\n5.  **Output:** The rotated, color-modified upper section is the final output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_divider_row(grid, divider_color=4):\n    \"\"\"Finds the row index of the divider.\"\"\"\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        if np.all(row == divider_color):\n            return i\n    return -1\n\ndef rotate_anti_clockwise(grid):\n    \"\"\"Rotates a grid 90 degrees anti-clockwise.\"\"\"\n    return np.rot90(grid, k=1)\n\ndef get_orange_positions(grid):\n    \"\"\"Gets the positions of orange pixels within the grid.\"\"\"\n    orange_positions = np.where(grid == 7)\n    return list(zip(orange_positions[0], orange_positions[1]))\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the rules.\"\"\"\n    grid = np.array(input_grid)\n\n    # Find the divider row.\n    divider_row_index = find_divider_row(grid)\n\n    # If no divider is found, return an empty grid.\n    if divider_row_index == -1:\n        return []\n\n    # Extract the upper section of the grid.\n    upper_section = grid[:divider_row_index]\n\n    # Get initial orange positions.\n    orange_positions = get_orange_positions(upper_section)\n\n    # Placeholder for conditional color substitution -  This needs to be improved.\n    # For now, we're just replacing all, but we know this isn't fully correct.\n    # The analysis suggests a more refined positional rule.\n    \n    # Apply a refined color substitution rule based on observations from the previous analysis.\n    #  We observed some pattern, albeit not a simple one, on the relative positions being modified.\n    modified_upper_section = upper_section.copy()\n    for r, c in orange_positions:\n      if (r + c) % 3 == 0:  # Example rule - needs refinement, this did not fully solve\n           modified_upper_section[r, c] = 3\n\n    # Rotate the modified upper section 90 degrees anti-clockwise.\n    rotated_upper_section = rotate_anti_clockwise(modified_upper_section)\n    \n    return rotated_upper_section.tolist()\n```"
