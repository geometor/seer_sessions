Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits (0-9), representing colors.
*   The output grids are larger than the input grids (double the height and width)
*    Non-zero values in the input grid appear to be "expanded" or "replicated" in the output grid.
*   Zero values in the input remain zero in the output, acting like a background.
*   The non-zero objects in the input are expanded into 2x2 blocks of the same value/color in the output.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: variable
        values: integers (0-9)
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: double of input_grid
        values: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel_block
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - shape: dynamic based on input
      - expansion factor for output : 2x2
      - expansion rule: replicates the input pixel color into a 2x2 block.
    relationships:
      - expands_to: output_grid

actions:
  - name: expand_pixel_block
    input: single colored pixel
    transformation: >
      Replicate the pixel to fill a square area that is 2x height and 2x width.
  - name: expand Input Grid
    input: input_grid
    transformation: apply expansion to each object in Input

relationships:
  - input_grid contains pixel_blocks.
  - output_grid is a result of expanding the input_grid's.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is twice the height and twice the width of the input grid, filled with zeros.

2.  **Iteration:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   If the pixel is non-zero:
        *   Replicate the pixel's value into a 2x2 block in the output grid. The top-left corner of this 2x2 block will be at coordinates (row \* 2, column \* 2), where 'row' and 'column' are the coordinates of the current pixel in the input grid.
    * If the pixel is 0, copy the 0s into the expanded grid output in all postions corresponding to the input (x * 2, y * 2), ((x+1) * 2, y * 2), (x * 2, (y+1) * 2), ((x+1) * 2, (y + 1) * 2)
3. return the output grid

Essentially the rule is to expand each pixel in the input grid into a 2x2 square of the same color in the corresponding location of the output grid, and expanding the canvas size to double.
