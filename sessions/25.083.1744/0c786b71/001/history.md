Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   The input grids are smaller (3x4) than the output grids (6x8 or 8x8).
*   The output grids seem to be a patterned expansion of the input grids.
*   The digits from input grid seem to form some kind of object, which gets duplicated to the output grid according to some pattern.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        dimensions: 3x4
        elements: integers (0-9)
  - output_grid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        dimensions:
          - 6x8
          - 8x8
        elements: integers (0-9)
  - pixel:
      type: element
      properties:
          color_id: integer

actions:
  - expansion:
      input: input_grid
      output: output_grid
      description: The input grid is expanded into a larger grid.
  - replication:
      input: pixel_pattern, input values
      output: repeated_patterns in output grid
      description: colors of input grid are replicated in some pattern, horizontally and vertically,
                    into a grid double in size

relationships:
  - input_to_output:
      type: transformation
      description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid by expanding and replicating
                   pixel patterns.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double Dimensions:** The output grid has dimensions that are twice the height and twice the width of the input grid.

2.  **Pattern replication and Expansion**: Iterate through input grid from right to left by column and top to bottom by row.

3.  **Mirror input**: replicate the first column of the input, from right to left, in the output grid, starting at index 0 and then every odd index afterwards.

4.  **Mirror Input cont**: Fill the next column in the output with the next column in the input going right to left, skipping the first index, but then adding it to every odd index.

5.  Repeat steps 3-4 until output is filled.

Essentially, the input grid is expanded by mirroring the values in the first column, and mirroring the values in the second column, and so on.
