objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        dimensions: 3x4
        elements: integers (0-9)
  - output_grid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        dimensions:
          - 6x8
          - 8x8
        elements: integers (0-9)
  - pixel:
      type: element
      properties:
          color_id: integer

actions:
  - expansion:
      input: input_grid
      output: output_grid
      description: The input grid is expanded into a larger grid.
  - replication:
      input: pixel_pattern, input values
      output: repeated_patterns in output grid
      description: colors of input grid are replicated in some pattern, horizontally and vertically,
                    into a grid double in size

relationships:
  - input_to_output:
      type: transformation
      description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid by expanding and replicating
                   pixel patterns.
