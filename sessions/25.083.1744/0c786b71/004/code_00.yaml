observations:
  - example_1:
      input:
        shape: (3, 4)
        description: "A 3x4 grid."
      output:
        shape: (6, 8)
        description: "A 6x8 grid, double the size of the input."
      transformation:
        type: "Column and Row interleaving and mirroring"
        details: "The output grid appears to be constructed by a complex interleaving of the input's columns and rows, and not simple replication, with some rows appearing to be mirrored."
  - example_2:
      input:
        shape: (3, 4)
        description: "A 3x4 grid."
      output:
        shape: (6, 8)
        description: "A 6x8 grid, double the size of the input."
      transformation:
        type: "Column and Row interleaving and mirroring"
        details: "Similar to example 1, the transformation involves a complex rearrangement of input rows and columns, with mirroring."
  - example_3:
      input:
        shape: (3, 4)
        description: "A 3x4 grid."
      output:
        shape: (6, 8)
        description: "A 6x8 grid, double the size of the input."
      transformation:
        type: "Column and Row interleaving and mirroring"
        details: "Consistent with the previous examples, the transformation is not a simple replication, but a more complex interleaving of columns and rows with some mirroring."
general:
    grid_size_relation: The output grid is always twice the height and twice the width of the input grid.
    transformation_type: "The transformation involves a complex rearrangement of columns and rows, possibly with reflection or mirroring along with interleaving. Simple replication is incorrect."
