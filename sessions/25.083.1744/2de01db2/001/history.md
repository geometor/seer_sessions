Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements**

The task involves transforming grids of single-digit integers (representing colors). The transformation appears to involve a horizontal mirroring or reflection, and the replacement of certain colors with others. It seems that '0' in the input plays an important part.

**YAML Block - Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The transformation appears to be a horizontal reflection.
  - observation: Specific colors are replaced systematically.
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same for input and output
      - values: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - action: color_replacement
    details:
      - 7 is replaced by 0
      - 2 is replaced by 0
      - other numbers are swapped in position around the center vertical axis
  - action: reflection
    details:
      - horizontal reflection around the center.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Reflect:** Horizontally reflect the input grid. This means swapping the positions of elements across the central vertical axis. For example, the first element becomes the last, the second becomes the second-to-last, and so on.
2.  **Color Replacement, phase 1:** Scan every cell of the input grid, if the original number is a `7` or a `2`, then the reflected number should become `0`.
3.  **Color Replacement, phase 2:** If a cell originally contained a `7` or a `2`, the color will change to `0` after the reflection.
4. return the reflected output grid after color replacement.
