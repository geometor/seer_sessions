1.  **Reflect:** Horizontally reflect the input grid. This means swapping the positions of elements across the central vertical axis. For example, the first element becomes the last, the second becomes the second-to-last, and so on.
2.  **Color Replacement, phase 1:** Scan every cell of the input grid, if the original number is a `7` or a `2`, then the reflected number should become `0`.
3.  **Color Replacement, phase 2:** If a cell originally contained a `7` or a `2`, the color will change to `0` after the reflection.

Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program correctly identified the horizontal reflection. However, the color replacement logic is flawed. It seems to be replacing colors based on what the *original* pixel values were, rather than the values *after* reflection. The expected outputs show that only '7's and '2's that end up on the left after reflection are replaced with black.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Clarify Color Replacement:** The core issue is the timing and condition of the color replacement. We need to apply it *after* reflection and consider where the '7' or '2' originally was in the grid, as this position dictates whether the reflected pixel is changed to '0'.
2.  **Positional Logic**: It may help to have the x, y values of the positions of 7's and 2's.
3. **YAML data**: I will prepare detailed YAML output of the data to use next round

**Example 3:**

Example 3 works perfectly, which suggests the core reflection is correct, and in this case, there are no 2's or 7's, therefore no complex color changes.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Reflect:** Reflect the input grid horizontally. This means to swap the positions of elements across the central vertical axis. The leftmost column becomes the rightmost, and so on.

2.  **Conditional Color Replacement:** After reflection, iterate through each cell of the *reflected* grid. Check the *original* input grid:
    *   If a cell in the *original* grid was a 7 or a 2, *and* the corresponding position in the reflected grid is in the *left half* of the reflected grid (column index < width / 2), then change the reflected grid cell's value to 0.
    *   note, in the event that the grid has an odd width, the middle cell will be included in the left half by virtue of integer division.

3.  Return the modified reflected grid.
