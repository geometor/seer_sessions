However, the subsequent examples reveal that this program is too specific and doesn't generalize well. The second and third examples highlight discrepancies. Specifically:\n\n*   **Example 2 & 3:** Reveals that the replacement of colors 7,2 with 0, occurs *only* in the positions where 7 or 2 exist in the original input *and* when those positions are reflected to the left half of the reflected grid. The previous attempt did not constrain the positions.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n1.  The core logic of horizontal reflection seems correct, so we'll retain that.\n2.  The conditional replacement needs to be corrected to only consider the original location of color before applying it to its reflected position, only if position is left side.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (using code execution):**\n\nI need to get the dimensions to determine the size of the left half of the grid.\n\n"
