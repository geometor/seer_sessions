facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of color values (0-9).
    properties:
      - height: variable (1-30)
      - width: variable (1-30)
      - color_palette: limited to 10 colors (0-9)

  - transformation: row-wise rotation and repetition
    details:
      - Each row of the input grid is processed independently.
      - Each row is rotated to the right. The number of positions of the rotation is equivalent to the row index (0-indexed).
      - The rotated row is then repeated to create the output row.
      - The output has a consistent width of 12. The repeating rotated row is truncated or extended to fit this size.
