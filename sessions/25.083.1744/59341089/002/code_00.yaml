facts:
  - object: input_grid_row
    type: list
    properties:
      length: 3
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    actions:
      - name: rotate_left
        parameter: row_index (0-indexed)
        description: Cyclically shifts elements to the left by 'row_index' positions.
      - name: repeat_with_insert
        parameter: 4 #repeats 4 times
        description: each element of rotated list is inserted between the repeated pattern

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      width: 12
      height: same as input_grid
    derivation:
      - Each row of the input grid is transformed independently.
      - The transformation of a row involves:
          1. Rotating the row left by a number of positions equal to its 0-indexed row number.
          2. Repeating each element of the rotated row four times, inserting it between repetitions of the original sequence.
