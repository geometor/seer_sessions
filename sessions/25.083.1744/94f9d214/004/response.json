            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was too narrowly focused on the first example and made incorrect assumptions about how to generalize the transformation. It correctly identified the 4x4 region of interest and the interaction between green and blue pixels. However, it incorrectly iterates only withing a 4x4 grid *in the input*, copies locations *to the input grid*, and uses *the input grid size*.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Clarify Region of Interest**: The 4x4 area seems crucial, and it always maps to the *output*, but it's indexing *input* incorrectly.\n2.  **Re-evaluate Pixel Placement:** The red pixels' placement logic needs to be consistent across all examples. The current assumption of row/col matching is not sufficient and needs adjustment\n3. **Fix iteration**: Iterate through the input grid, but only consider green pixels within the bounds of 4x4 region for marking, and always construct a separate 4x4 output grid.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example by Example):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Observation:** Red pixels appear at the bottom of the output where there are blues, not near the greens at all. The output grid size is copied from input.\n    *   **Metrics:** `Pixels Off: 6` - The output has the wrong shape.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Observation**: Output is an empty grid - and 4x4.\n    *   **Metrics**: `Pixels Off: 4` - The program did not identify that red pixels are supposed to appear.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two red pixels are in row 3.\n    *   **Metrics**: `Pixels Off: 3`\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   **Observation:** One red pixel at [3,3].\n    *    **Metrics**: `Pixels Off: 5`.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
