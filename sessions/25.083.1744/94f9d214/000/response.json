The output grids appear to be consistently 4x4.\n*   The input grids contain colors represented by digits 0-3 (white, blue, red, green). The output grids so far only use 0 (white) and 2 (red).\n*   The location of the red pixels (2) in the output grid seems to correspond to the location of certain green (3) and blue(1) pixels in the input, but not all. It appears some filtering or selection is occurring.\n*   There is no obvious simple geometric transformation (rotation, reflection, scaling).\n*\tThe position of the red pixels seems to be determined by two objects that are touching.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
