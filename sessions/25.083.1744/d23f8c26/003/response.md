1. **Identify Target Column:** Analyze the input grid to determine the single column to be preserved. The exact rule for selection is currently unknown, but it results in column 2 being selected in examples 1 and 3, and column 1 in example 2.
2. **Preserve Target Column:** Iterate through the input grid.
    *   If a pixel is in the target column AND the pixel is not white(0): Copy its original color value to the corresponding position in the output grid.
    *   If a pixel is in the target column, and is 0, keep it 0.
3. **Blank Other Columns:** For all pixels *not* in the target column, set their value in the output grid to 0 (white).
