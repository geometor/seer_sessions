facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9) representing colors
    description: The initial state of the grid.

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      dimensions: same as the bottom region of the input_grid
    description: The transformed state of the grid.

  - object: separator
    properties:
      type: horizontal line
      color: yellow (4)
    description: Divides the input_grid into top and bottom regions.

  - object: top_region
    properties:
      type: subgrid
      location: above the separator in input_grid
    description:  Source of transformation rules for the output_grid.

  - object: bottom_region
    properties:
      type: subgrid
      location: below the separator in input_grid
      dimensions: same as output_grid
    description: Provides a template for transforming white pixels in the top_region.

  - action: transform_blue
    input: blue pixel (1) in top_region
    output: green pixel (3) in output_grid
    description: Blue pixels are always transformed to green.

  - action: transform_white
    input: white pixel (0) in top_region
    output: pixel with color from bottom_region at the same coordinates in output_grid
    description: White pixels in top_region are replaced by the color value in corresponding coordinate of the bottom region.
