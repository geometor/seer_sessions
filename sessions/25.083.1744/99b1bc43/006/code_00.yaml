facts:
  - object: separator
    type: horizontal_line
    color: yellow
    property: divides_grid
    details: Separates the input grid into a top and bottom region.

  - object: top_region
    description: The grid area above the separator.
    action: source_of_transformation
    details: Blue pixels in this region are transformed to green in the output. White pixels dictate a copy from corresponding bottom-region coordinates.

  - object: bottom_region
    description: The grid area below the separator.
    action: template_for_white_pixels, output_size
    details: Provides the dimensions for the output grid, and color values when white pixels are in corresponding top positions.

  - object: output_grid
    dimensions: same_as_bottom_region
    initial_state: all_zero
    transformation_rule: |
       Blue pixels in the top_region become green in the output_grid at the same (row,col).
       White pixels in the top_region cause the output_grid pixel at the same (row,col) to take the corresponding value from the bottom_region at the same (row,col). All other top region pixels do not effect the output_grid.
       All output grid pixels that are not affected by the top region are zero.

  - action: pixel_transformation
    details: Based on color in top region, either change color or copy from bottom region, but output location is not relative to the separator.
