  - description: "Input grids are divided into two regions by a horizontal line of yellow pixels."
    objects:
      - name: top_region
        properties:
          - "Located above the yellow line."
          - "Contains various colored pixels."
      - name: bottom_region
        properties:
          - "Located below the yellow line."
          - "Contains various colored pixels."
      - name: yellow_line
        properties:
          - "A horizontal line of pixels, all with color value 4 (yellow)."
          - "Separates the top and bottom regions."

  - description: "Output grid dimensions match the dimensions of the bottom region."
    objects:
      - name: output_grid
        properties:
          - "height is equal to bottom_region height"
          - "width is equal to bottom_region width"

  - description: "The output grid is a transformed copy of the top region."
    actions:
      - "Copy the grid values from the input top_region to output"
      - "The position of copied values matches their original position in input top_region"
      - "There is 1:1 mapping of input and output rows and columns."

  - description: "Specific colors in the top region are transformed to different colors in the output region, according to a consistent mapping."
    actions:
      - map: "If input top_region cell is blue (1), output cell at that position is green (3)."
      - map: "If input top_region cell is white (0), output cell at that position *can* be either white (0) or blue (3), depending on the example."
