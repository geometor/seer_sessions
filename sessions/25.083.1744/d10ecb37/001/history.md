Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** Rectangular grids of varying dimensions, filled with single-digit integers (colors).
*   **Output:** 2x2 grids, also filled with single-digit integers (colors). The output grids appear to be derived from the input grids, not created anew.
*   **General Observation:** The output seems to be a drastically reduced or summarized form of the input, maintaining the original ordering of the colors, but with a strong simplification of colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
    actions:
      - observed: none (passive)

  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2 x 2
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors, derived from input_grid
    actions:
      - observed: none (result of transformation)

  - type: color_pair
     properties:
        - first: color observed in input_grid
        - second: next adjacent color, different color, observed in input_grid

relationships:
  - type: derivation
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    description: The output_grid is derived from the input_grid through a transformation rule.
  - type: contains
    source: input_grid
    target: color_pair
    description: color_pair is a sequence of adjacent colors

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Scan the Input:** Traverse the input grid row by row, from left to right.
2.  **Identify Unique Color Pairs:** For each cell, if its color is different than previous cell color, store the previou color and the current color.
3. **Extract first two rows** Create an output grid. The first row has the first color, the second color. The second row has the third and forth.

Essentially, the transformation identifies the first four unique, ordered color pairs and uses those four colors in their original sequence to construct the 2x2 output grid.
