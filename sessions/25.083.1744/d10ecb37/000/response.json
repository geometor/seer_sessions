The output grids appear to be derived from the input grids, not created anew.\n*   **General Observation:** The output seems to be a drastically reduced or summarized form of the input, maintaining the original ordering of the colors, but with a strong simplification of colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
