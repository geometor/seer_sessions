            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and the approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of identifying the first four distinct colors based on transitions worked for the first example but failed for the second and third. The primary issue is that the code considers *any* color transition as a trigger for adding a new color to the `distinct_colors` list. This isn't correct, as shown by examples 2 and 3. The order of colors in output grids seem to be determined by their first appearances in a row-major scan, and the comparison is not relative the last distinct color, but to each cell's immediate left neighbor (or top, if first in row)\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Color Selection:** Instead of simply checking for a difference from the last *distinct* color, we need to check for the initial appearance of each color relative the last cell visited.\n2.  **Row-Major Order:** Explicitly emphasize the row-major scanning (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) in the natural language program and implementation.\n3. **Handle edge cases**: Add support for less than four colors.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis for now, since the provided results already cover the basics):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 8x8 grid.\n    *   Output: 2x2 grid.\n    *   Colors in output: 2, 4, 5 (in order of first appearance). The code returned the first distinct colors.\n    *   Result: Correct.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 6x6 grid.\n    *   Output: 2x2 grid.\n    *   Colors in output: 4, 3, 6, 0 (order of first appearance).\n    * Code Output: 4,3,6,4. It seems the code considers the color is distinct if different then the `previous_color`, but the `previous_color` is the last distinct color added and not the color of the cell to its left.\n    *   Result: Incorrect (1 pixel off).\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 12x6 grid.\n    *   Output: 2x2 grid.\n    *   Colors in output: 3, 2, 1, 4 (order of first appearance).\n    *   Result: Incorrect (1 pixel off). Same problem as example 2.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
