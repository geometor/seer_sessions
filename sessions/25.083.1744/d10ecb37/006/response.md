Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and the approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of identifying the first four distinct colors based on transitions worked for the first example but failed for the second and third. The primary issue is that the code considers *any* color transition as a trigger for adding a new color to the `distinct_colors` list. This isn't correct, as shown by examples 2 and 3. The order of colors in output grids seem to be determined by their first appearances in a row-major scan, and the comparison is not relative the last distinct color, but to each cell's immediate left neighbor (or top, if first in row)

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Color Selection:** Instead of simply checking for a difference from the last *distinct* color, we need to check for the initial appearance of each color relative the last cell visited.
2.  **Row-Major Order:** Explicitly emphasize the row-major scanning (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) in the natural language program and implementation.
3. **Handle edge cases**: Add support for less than four colors.

**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis for now, since the provided results already cover the basics):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 8x8 grid.
    *   Output: 2x2 grid.
    *   Colors in output: 2, 4, 5 (in order of first appearance). The code returned the first distinct colors.
    *   Result: Correct.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 6x6 grid.
    *   Output: 2x2 grid.
    *   Colors in output: 4, 3, 6, 0 (order of first appearance).
    * Code Output: 4,3,6,4. It seems the code considers the color is distinct if different then the `previous_color`, but the `previous_color` is the last distinct color added and not the color of the cell to its left.
    *   Result: Incorrect (1 pixel off).

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 12x6 grid.
    *   Output: 2x2 grid.
    *   Colors in output: 3, 2, 1, 4 (order of first appearance).
    *   Result: Incorrect (1 pixel off). Same problem as example 2.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Scan the Input Grid:** Traverse the input grid row by row, from left to right within each row, and from the top row to the bottom row.
2.  **Identify First Four Distinct Colors:** As you scan the grid, keep track of the first four distinct colors you encounter. A color is considered "distinct" if it's the *first* time that color has appeared in the entire scan, relative the last cell.
3.  **Construct 2x2 Output Grid:** Once you have identified four distinct colors, arrange them into a 2x2 grid in the order they were found.
4. **Handle Edge Cases:** If the grid has less than 4 unique colors, return an array with those colors in the order of appearance. If no colors are found, return an empty array.

Revised strategy for identifying distinct colors:

- Maintain a set `seen_colors = set()`.
- Initialize an empty list `distinct_colors = []`
- For each cell in row major order:
    - if the current cell's color is not in `seen_colors`:
        - add it to `seen_colors`
        - append it to distinct_colors
        - if `len(distinct_colors) == 4` return and build grid
