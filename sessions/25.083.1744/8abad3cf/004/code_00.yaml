examples:
  example_1:
    input:
      dimensions: [4, 10]
      objects:
        - description: Full grid
          color: 4 (yellow)
          shape: rectangle
        - description: Right side object
          color: 1 (blue)
          shape: vertical line
    output:
      dimensions: [1, 6]
      objects:
          - description: Left object in output
            color: 1 (blue)
            shape: point
            source: right_side, top
          - description: Right object in output
            color: 4 (yellow)
            shape: vertical line
            source: left_side, mirrored
    transformation:
      - Split input grid vertically into left and right halves.
      - Mirror the left half horizontally.
      - Extract the first row of the right half.
      - Concatenate the extracted row from the right half with the mirrored left half.
  example_2:
    input:
      dimensions: [5, 12]
      objects:
          - description: Full grid
            color: 4
            shape: rectangle
          - description: Right side object
            color: 1
            shape: vertical line
    output:
      dimensions: [1, 8]
      objects:
          - description: Left most object in output
            color: 1 (blue)
            shape: point
            source: right_side, top
