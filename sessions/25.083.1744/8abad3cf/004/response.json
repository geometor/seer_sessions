            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a hypothesis derived from the first training example.  The errors encountered in subsequent examples (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\") strongly suggest a flaw in a conditional statement or a boolean operation.  Specifically, the `output_rows` calculation: `output_rows = len(input_grid) - len(input_grid) + (len(input_grid) - len(get_top_portion(input_grid, 0 if not input_grid else len(input_grid[0]) - (0 if not left_side else len(left_side[0])))))` seems problematic, likely due to how arrays are being handled within conditional checks (the `if not input_grid` and `if not left_side` parts).  It's trying to treat entire arrays as single boolean values, which is incorrect.\n\nThe core strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Debug `output_rows`:** Simplify and correctly determine the logic for calculating how many rows to take from the right side. This likely involves comparing dimensions of the input and output grids in each example, rather than trying to derive it all in one complex, error-prone expression. We will use direct measurements from input/output.\n2.  **Re-evaluate the Natural Language Program:**  After fixing the core logic, we'll revise the natural language program to accurately reflect the corrected transformation.\n3. **Example Specific Debugging**: We need to run the code for each example and the test, capturing dimensions, and identify objects.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Debugging:**\n\nLet's use `tool_code` to get the dimensions of the input and output grids for each example, and also to inspect the intermediate results of `split_grid_vertical`, `mirror_horizontal`, and `get_top_portion`. This will help pinpoint exactly where the logic breaks down.\n\n"
