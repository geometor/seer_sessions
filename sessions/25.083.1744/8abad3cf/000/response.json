Split the Input grid into a Left side, and a Right side. The determination of where the split occurs is not clear.\n3.    **Mirror and Invert**: A mirrored and inverted version of the Left side becomes the new Right side of the Output grid.\n4. The Right side of the input is reordered to become the Left side of the output. The Right Side's bottom portion is discarded, retaining the original top portion.\n\nThe main challenge is to derive a general, complete rule on how the split is made and applied, which might require analyzing additional examples. The current program works from simple observations, but needs more details for completion.\n"
