There's one in the top-left quadrant and another in the bottom-right quadrant of the grid.\n\n2.  **Detect Change:** Observe that a blue pixel (color 1) appears to be placed adjacently to the right of the topmost azure pixel of each L-shape. The position is relative to individual object components.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule:** For each disconnected azure (color 8) object, place a blue pixel (color 1) to the immediate right of the highest azure pixel in that object. If the position is not empty (occupied by another color), do not apply the change.\n\n**Elaboration and Justification:**\nThe rule focuses on local changes. The '8' objects are preserved. The action involves taking the topmost coordinate of each distinct object and adding a '1' one pixel to its right. This rule works regardless of the overall structure of the azure shapes, as long as they are not diagonally connected.\n"
