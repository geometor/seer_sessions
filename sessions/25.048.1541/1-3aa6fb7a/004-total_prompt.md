Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate azure 'L' shapes, one in the top-left and one in the bottom-right."

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Same as in input_grid."
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1, 2), (4,4)]
      shape: "Two single blue pixels"
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct "L"-shaped objects made of azure (color 8) pixels. There's one in the top-left quadrant and another in the bottom-right quadrant of the grid.

2.  **Detect Change:** Observe that a blue pixel (color 1) appears to be placed adjacently to the right of the topmost azure pixel of each L-shape. The position is relative to individual object components.

3.  **Transformation Rule:** For each disconnected azure (color 8) object, place a blue pixel (color 1) to the immediate right of the highest azure pixel in that object. If the position is not empty (occupied by another color), do not apply the change.

**Elaboration and Justification:**
The rule focuses on local changes. The '8' objects are preserved. The action involves taking the topmost coordinate of each distinct object and adding a '1' one pixel to its right. This rule works regardless of the overall structure of the azure shapes, as long as they are not diagonally connected.

Okay, let's analyze the second example provided.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: "Three separate azure objects. One in the top-right, one in the center-left and one in the bottom."

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: "Same as in input_grid."
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: "Three single blue pixels"
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe three disconnected azure (color 8) objects of various shapes.

2.  **Detect Change:**  A blue pixel (color 1) is added to the right of the highest azure pixel of *each* disconnected azure object.

3.  **Transformation Rule:** For each disconnected azure (color 8) object, place a blue pixel (color 1) to the immediate right of the highest azure pixel in that object. If that position is out of the grid bounds, do not apply the change for the object.

**Elaboration and Justification:**

This description is nearly identical to the previous one. The core concept remains consistent: find each disconnected object of color 8, identify the topmost pixel within each object, and add a blue pixel to its right. The critical difference in this example, as requested, is to deal correctly with multiple separated components. The code provided already supports this and the validation in the previous round holds.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
