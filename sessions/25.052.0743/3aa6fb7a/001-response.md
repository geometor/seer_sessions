Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
task: 001-example_1
input_grid_size: 7x7
output_grid_size: 7x7
colors:
  - 0: white
  - 8: azure
  - 1: blue # only in output
objects:
  - object1:
      color: 8
      shape: L-shape (2x2 block minus a corner)
      positions:
        - input: (1,1) # top-left corner of the L
        - output: (1,1)
  - object2:
          color: 8
          shape: L-shape (inverted)
          positions:
            - input: (3,4)
            - output: (3,4)
  - object3:
      color: 1
      shape: single cell
      positions:
           - input: None
           - output: (1,2) # one cell
  - object4:
      color: 1
      shape: single cell
      positions:
          - input: None
          - output: (4,5) # one cell
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two L-shaped objects made of azure (color 8) pixels. One L-shape is in the top-left corner, and the other, inverted, is near the center-right.

2.  **Object Persistence:** These azure objects remain in the same positions and maintain their shapes in the output grid.

3. **Introduce New Objects:** Two new single-cell objects with blue color(color code 1) are created by adding the position values of corner points and filling the spot of color 8 in the color code.

4. **Corner point 1** One single-cell object is at position (1,2). The position is calculated by the top corner point of the top-left azure L-shape.

5. **Corner point 2** Another single-cell object is at position (4,5). The position is calculated by the top corner point of the center-right azure L-shape.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation preserves the two azure L-shaped objects and introduces two new blue pixels. First at the top corner point coordinates (1, 2) of the top-left azure object. Another at the top corner point coordinates (4, 5) of the center-right azure color object.

Now, I'm ready to implement the Python function, If there are any adjustments to be made according to your points, let me know.
