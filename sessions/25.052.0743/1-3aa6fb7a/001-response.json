One L-shape is in the top-left corner, and the other, inverted, is near the center-right.\n\n2.  **Object Persistence:** These azure objects remain in the same positions and maintain their shapes in the output grid.\n\n3. **Introduce New Objects:** Two new single-cell objects with blue color(color code 1) are created by adding the position values of corner points and filling the spot of color 8 in the color code.\n\n4. **Corner point 1** One single-cell object is at position (1,2). The position is calculated by the top corner point of the top-left azure L-shape.\n\n5. **Corner point 2** Another single-cell object is at position (4,5). The position is calculated by the top corner point of the center-right azure L-shape.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation preserves the two azure L-shaped objects and introduces two new blue pixels. First at the top corner point coordinates (1, 2) of the top-left azure object. Another at the top corner point coordinates (4, 5) of the center-right azure color object.\n\nNow, I'm ready to implement the Python function, If there are any adjustments to be made according to your points, let me know.\n"
