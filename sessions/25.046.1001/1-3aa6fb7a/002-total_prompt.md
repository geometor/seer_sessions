Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: irregular, two separate components
      positions:
        - (1,1), (2,1), (2,2)  # Top-left component
        - (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)  # Bottom-right component
  size: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: irregular, two separate components
      positions:
        - (1,1), (2,1), (2,2)  # Top-left component
        - (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)  # Bottom-right component
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      positions:
        - (1,2)
        -(4,4)
  size: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is located in the top-left region of the grid, and the other is in the bottom-right region.

2.  **Preserve Existing Objects:** The azure objects in the input grid remain in the same positions and retain their shapes in the output grid. No change occurs to those objects.

3. **Introduce New Objects**: For each azure object identified, add a blue (color 1) pixel beside the top right pixel.

4. **Applying the rule.** A blue pixel is created beside the top right pixel of the first object, so a blue object of color 1 and coordinates (1, 2) is added. Then, a blue pixel is created beside the top right pixel of the second object, so a new blue object of color 1 with coordinates (4, 4) is generated.

In summary, the transformation preserves the azure objects and adds a blue pixel beside the top-right pixel of each.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    expected_output = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    print()
    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
