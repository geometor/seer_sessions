The input grids contain a single non-zero color (other than white/0) surrounded by zeros.  The output grid seems to consist of only that non-zero color, and the number of pixels in the output grid seems related to the count of that non-zero color in the input grid, or perhaps the number of times it occurs in an adjacent or non-adjacent form.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
