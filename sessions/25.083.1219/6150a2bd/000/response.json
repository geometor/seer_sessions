The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (both 3x3 in the first example, and both 3x2 in the second example). The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic on the numbers, but rather a rearrangement or mirroring of the grid elements. There's a strong suggestion of spatial manipulation rather than numerical calculation. The colors/numbers are likely treated as distinct objects, not numerical values.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
