## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1

```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid. The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (both 3x3 in the first example, and both 3x2 in the second example). The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic on the numbers, but rather a rearrangement or mirroring of the grid elements. There's a strong suggestion of spatial manipulation rather than numerical calculation. The colors/numbers are likely treated as distinct objects, not numerical values.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - observation: "Each cell in the grid contains a single-digit integer, representing a color."
  - object: "Grid"
    properties:
      - "2-dimensional array of integers"
      - "width"
      - "height"
      - "cells"
    actions:
      - "rotated"
      - "mirrored"

  - relationship: "Input grid transforms to output grid."
  - transformation_type: "Spatial rearrangement"
  - specific_transformation: "Input grid seems flipped both vertically and horizontally."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 180 degrees to produce the output grid. This can be achieved by performing a horizontal flip followed by a vertical flip (or vice-versa).  The positions of the elements are inverted both row-wise and column-wise.

Essentially, if we index elements of the input array starting from 0 at the top-left, element i,j in the input corresponds to n-1-i, m-1-j in the output, for an input array of dimension n x m.
