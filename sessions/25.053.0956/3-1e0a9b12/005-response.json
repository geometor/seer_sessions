Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9) representing different colors.  The transformation seems to involve some form of object movement or shifting, specifically of non-zero pixels, based on their relative positions.  The zero-valued pixels appear to act as empty space. It seems that there is some kind of pulling or sliding activity.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
