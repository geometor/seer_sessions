# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 1 0
0 3 0 0 0
0 3 0 1 2
6 0 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7C3262DFE3E0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 0
0 3 0 1 0
6 3 0 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7C3262DFF8B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 5x5 grids. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9) representing different colors.  The transformation seems to involve some form of object movement or shifting, specifically of non-zero pixels, based on their relative positions.  The zero-valued pixels appear to act as empty space. It seems that there is some kind of pulling or sliding activity.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: shift
    description: Move non-zero pixels based on a specific rule.
    parameters:
      direction:  inferred (likely vertical or horizontal)
      magnitude: inferred (number of positions to move)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent horizontally and vertically.
  - type: spatial
    description:  The relative positions of non-zero pixels define the transformation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify non-zero pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid with a value other than 0.
2.  **Group non-zero pixel clusters:** Consider each contiguous line of pixels to be its own object.
3.  **Move Objects down:** For each identified object, shift the pixels *down* by rows, according to these constraints:
   - The object shifts, as a group, into the empty space(s) occupied by zero(s).
   - If any two objects are on top of each other, then combine those into one object and move all of the combined pixels down together.
4.  **Preserve relative positions:** No change, if not specified above.
5.  **Fill empty cells:** Any cell left empty after applying the shift should be filled with 0.

In Summary, the program slides clusters of colored pixels down, merging similar objects, and fills empty pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
