# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 9
0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 0
4 0 7 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7C3261942AD0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 9
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 6x6 grids. Both grids primarily contain the value '0' (white).  The input grid has a few non-zero values: '9' (maroon) in the top right, '8' (azure) near the top, and a small cluster of '4' (yellow), '7' (orange), and '8' (azure) towards the bottom left. The output grid is mostly similar, except that the '9' (maroon) has moved to the bottom right corner, and the '8' that was alone is a '0' in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
        dominant: true
      - value: 9
        color: maroon
        initial_position: [0, 5]
        final_position: [5, 5]
      - value: 8
        color: azure
        initial_position: [1, 3]
        final_position: [4,3]
      - value: 4
        color: yellow
        initial_position: [3, 0]
        final_position: [3, 0]
      - value: 7
        color: orange
        initial_position: [4, 2]
        final_position: [4, 2]
  - observation: The maroon '9' moves from the top-right to the bottom-right.
  - observation: the isolated azure '8' is zeroed out
  - observation: The cluster of '4', '7', and the adjacent '8' seems to be unchanged in position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the maroon pixel (value '9').
2.  **Move** this pixel to the bottom right corner of the grid.
3. **Identify** any single azure (value '8'). If they are not adjacent to any other colors, change them to 0
4.  **Preserve** all other colored pixels at their original locations.

Essentially, the transformation rule appears to reposition the maroon colored pixel and remove isolated azure colored pixels, while maintaining a cluster of other colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
