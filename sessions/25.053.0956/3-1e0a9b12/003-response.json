Both grids primarily contain the value '0' (white).  The input grid has a few non-zero values: '9' (maroon) in the top right, '8' (azure) near the top, and a small cluster of '4' (yellow), '7' (orange), and '8' (azure) towards the bottom left. The output grid is mostly similar, except that the '9' (maroon) has moved to the bottom right corner, and the '8' that was alone is a '0' in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
