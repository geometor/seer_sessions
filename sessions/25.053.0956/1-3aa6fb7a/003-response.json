            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed updates:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code's logic is partially correct. It identifies azure (8) pixels and attempts to change them to blue (1) based on vertical adjacency. However, it only considers the *immediate* top and bottom neighbors. The errors in the examples show that the rule should apply to the *entire* vertical line of azure pixels \u2013 changing only the top and bottom pixels of the *entire* contiguous vertical line of azure to blue.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the logic to correctly identify the start and end of *contiguous* vertical lines of azure pixels. We need to traverse upwards and downwards from each azure pixel until a non-azure pixel (or the edge of the grid) is encountered.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\n\nHere's a more detailed analysis of each example, focusing on where the code's assumptions fail:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    *   **Input:** A vertical line of two 8s and two sets of vertical lines of 8s of two 8s in the same row, separated by a single 0.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Only the top and bottom of each continuous vertical azure sections should be blue.\n    *   **Transformed Output:** *All* azure pixels adjacent to a non-azure pixel, even horizontally are changed.\n    *   **Error:** The code incorrectly changes azure pixels to blue in the middle of continuous vertical sections. And incorrectly handles horizontally adjacent azure pixels.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    *   **Input:** Several single azure pixels and connected vertical/horizontal collections\n    *   **Expected Output:** Only top and bottom.\n    *   **Transformed Output:** Same as Example 1.\n    *   **Error:** Same as Example 1.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: grid\n    type: 2D array\n    description: Represents a grid of pixels with color values.\n  - name: pixel\n    type: integer\n    description: Represents a single cell in the grid, with values 0-9 corresponding to colors.\n  - name: vertical_line\n    type: contiguous_pixels\n    description: A sequence of one or more vertically adjacent pixels of the same color.\n\nproperties:\n  - name: color\n    type: attribute\n    values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n    description: The color of a pixel, represented by an integer.  Relevant colors are azure (8) and blue (1).\n  - name: adjacency\n    type: relationship\n    description: Describes how pixels are connected (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).\n\nactions:\n  - name: identify_vertical_lines\n    description: Finds contiguous vertical lines of azure pixels.\n  - name: modify_color\n    description: Changes the color of specific pixels from azure to blue.\n\nrules:\n  - condition: \"Pixel is part of a vertical line of azure pixels\"\n    action: \"Change the top and bottom pixels of the line to blue, leaving the middle pixels azure.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Iterate:** Go through each pixel in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Identify Azure:** Check if the current pixel is azure (value 8).\n\n3.  **Find Vertical Line Boundaries:** If a pixel is azure:\n    *   Traverse upwards from the current pixel until a non-azure pixel or the top edge of the grid is reached. This marks the top of the vertical line.\n    *   Traverse downwards from the current pixel until a non-azure pixel or the bottom edge of the grid is reached. This marks the bottom of the vertical line.\n\n4.  **Modify Top and Bottom:**\n    *   Change the color of the top pixel of the identified vertical line to blue (value 1).\n    *   Change the color of the bottom pixel of the identified vertical line to blue (value 1).\n    *   Leave the color of all other pixels in the line unchanged (azure).\n\n5.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.\n"
