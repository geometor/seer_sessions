# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7C3262E31F30>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 8 1 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7C3262E317B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a color value represented by a digit (0-9). The primary colors observed are white (0) and azure (8).  The transformation seems to involve the introduction of blue (1) pixels in specific locations relative to the azure (8) pixels. It looks like some azure (8) are replaced.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - width: 7
      - height: 7
      - cell_values: [0-9]

  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          mapping:
            0: white
            1: blue
            8: azure

  - observation: input_grid
    description: Initial state of the grid
    details: Contains white and azure pixels

  - observation: output_grid
    description: Transformed state of the grid
    details: Contains white, azure, and blue pixels

  - action: replacement
    description: some azure pixels are changed
    details: changed to blue pixels

  - relationship: spatial_proximity
    description: The blue pixels appear near the original azure pixels. They sometimes replace an 8 on the inside of a cluster of 8s and sometimes appear diagonally adjacent on the outside.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Clusters:** Locate all contiguous clusters of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. A cluster can be a single isolated pixel or a group of adjacent pixels.

2. **Inner Replacement** For each azure cluster of more than one pixel, going from left to right, top to bottom, find each 8 that has adjacent 8s on all four sides (up, down, left, right) and replace the first found 8 with a 1.

3. **Outer Placement**: Locate all azure pixels on the edges of an azure cluster that are adjacent to zero (white) pixels on the top-left diagonal. If a 8 is found adjacent to a white on its top left diagonal, replace the white with a 1.

4.  **Output:** The resulting grid, after these replacements, is the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
