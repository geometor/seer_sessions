Previous Code:
```python
"""
Iterate through all pixels in the input grid. If a pixel is azure (value 8),
determine if it should be changed to blue (value 1). An azure pixel is
changed to blue if it is in the first row of a group of azures in a
vertical line or is in the last row of azure pixel in a vertical line of
group of azures. Create a new grid with the modified pixel values.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
