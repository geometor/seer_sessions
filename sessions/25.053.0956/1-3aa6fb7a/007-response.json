The primary colors observed are white (0) and azure (8).  The transformation seems to involve the introduction of blue (1) pixels in specific locations relative to the azure (8) pixels. It looks like some azure (8) are replaced.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

A cluster can be a single isolated pixel or a group of adjacent pixels.\n\n2. **Inner Replacement** For each azure cluster of more than one pixel, going from left to right, top to bottom, find each 8 that has adjacent 8s on all four sides (up, down, left, right) and replace the first found 8 with a 1.\n\n3. **Outer Placement**: Locate all azure pixels on the edges of an azure cluster that are adjacent to zero (white) pixels on the top-left diagonal. If a 8 is found adjacent to a white on its top left diagonal, replace the white with a 1.\n\n4.  **Output:** The resulting grid, after these replacements, is the output grid.\n"
