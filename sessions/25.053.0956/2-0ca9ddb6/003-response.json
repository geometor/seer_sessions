The input grid contains a few non-zero pixels scattered within a field of zeros (white pixels). The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input, with additional non-zero pixels and some changes to the existing ones. There's a sense of expansion or mirroring, and perhaps interaction between different colored pixels. The colors themselves seem significant, not just arbitrary numbers.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

These are the \"seed\" pixels for the transformation.\n\n2.  **Mirroring/Expansion (Azure Pixel):**\n    *   The azure (8) pixel in the input (at position (0, 3)) seems to remain unchanged. No operations apply to it.\n\n3.  **Mirroring/Expansion (Blue and Red Pixels):**\n    *    Blue (1) and Red (2) are core action pixels\n    *    Each of the original blue and red pixels appears to influence the final formation.\n\n4. **Orange Interaction**:\n      *    Wherever a blue (1) pixel is mirrored, place an orange pixel (7) on each side.\n      *    Wherever a red (2) pixel is mirrored, place a yellow pixel (4) on each side.\n\n5.  **Overwrite/Dominance:** If the expansion of different colored pixels results in overlapping positions, the new generated color overwrites.\n\nHere is the step by step application of the program to the input.\n\n1.  **Identify Key Pixels**:\n    *   Azure (8) at (0, 3)\n    *   Blue (1) at (3, 2)\n    *   Red (2) at (2, 6)\n    *   Blue (1) at (6, 6)\n    *   Red (2) at (7, 1)\n\n2. **Azure (8) Remains**\n   * (0,3) remains azure (8)\n\n3.  **Mirror/Expand, Blue(1) at (3,2)**.\n    * Mirrored at (3, 6) - value becomes blue(1).\n    * Add Orange (7) on either side - (3,1) and (3,3)\n    * Add Orange (7) on the mirrored side - (3,5) and (3,7)\n\n4. **Mirror/Expand, Red(2) at (2,6)**.\n    * Mirrored at (2, 2) - value becomes red(2).\n    * Add Yellow (4) on either side - (6,5) and (6,7)\n    * Add Yellow (4) on the mirrored side - (6,1) and (6,3)\n\n5.  **Mirror/Expand, Blue(1) at (6,6)**.\n    * Mirrored at (6, 2) - value becomes blue(1).\n    * Add Orange (7) on either side - (6,5) and (6,7)\n    * Add Orange (7) on the mirrored side - (6,1) and (6,3)\n\n6. **Mirror/Expand, Red(2) at (7,1)**.\n    * Mirrored at (7, 7) - value becomes red(2).\n    * Add Yellow (4) on either side - (7,0) and (7,2)\n    * Add Yellow (4) on the mirrored side - (7,6) and (7,8)\n\n7. **Overlap**\n   * positions (3,1) , (3,3) and (3,5) , (3,7) and (2,2) are overwritten\n   * positions (6,5) , (6,7) and (6,1) , (6,3) and (7,7) are overwritten\n   * position (7,0) , (7,2) and (7,6) , (7,8) do not have an overlap\n\nThis is a very detailed hypothesis, and there's not a clear indication of how the mirroring works. The program requires more information, it will require more analysis with more examples\n"
