The transformation seems to involve adding new colored pixels (yellow, orange) around the existing ones, particularly in a cross or plus-sign (+) shape. The original colors seem to remain. There's likely a relationship between existing colors, the background, and the new colors added.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
