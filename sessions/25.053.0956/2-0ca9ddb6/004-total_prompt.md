Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9) into another grid of the same dimensions. The input grid contains a few non-zero pixels scattered within a field of zeros (white pixels). The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input, with additional non-zero pixels and some changes to the existing ones. There's a sense of expansion or mirroring, and perhaps interaction between different colored pixels. The colors themselves seem significant, not just arbitrary numbers.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - cells: pixels (integers 0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:  (mapped from integer value)
        - 0: white
        - 1: blue
        - 2: red
        - 8: azure
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: mirror_and_expand
    description:  Pixels seem to be mirrored and expanded, with some interaction based on color.
    parameters:
      - mirroring_axis:  Not definitively clear (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
      - expansion_factor: Not a simple scaling, more like a conditional propagation.
      - interaction_rules:  Some colors appear to overwrite or combine with others.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description:  Neighboring pixels seem to influence each other.
  - type: color_interaction
    description:  Different colored pixels interact differently when they meet during expansion.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all non-zero pixels in the input grid. These are the "seed" pixels for the transformation.

2.  **Mirroring/Expansion (Azure Pixel):**
    *   The azure (8) pixel in the input (at position (0, 3)) seems to remain unchanged. No operations apply to it.

3.  **Mirroring/Expansion (Blue and Red Pixels):**
    *    Blue (1) and Red (2) are core action pixels
    *    Each of the original blue and red pixels appears to influence the final formation.

4. **Orange Interaction**:
      *    Wherever a blue (1) pixel is mirrored, place an orange pixel (7) on each side.
      *    Wherever a red (2) pixel is mirrored, place a yellow pixel (4) on each side.

5.  **Overwrite/Dominance:** If the expansion of different colored pixels results in overlapping positions, the new generated color overwrites.

Here is the step by step application of the program to the input.

1.  **Identify Key Pixels**:
    *   Azure (8) at (0, 3)
    *   Blue (1) at (3, 2)
    *   Red (2) at (2, 6)
    *   Blue (1) at (6, 6)
    *   Red (2) at (7, 1)

2. **Azure (8) Remains**
   * (0,3) remains azure (8)

3.  **Mirror/Expand, Blue(1) at (3,2)**.
    * Mirrored at (3, 6) - value becomes blue(1).
    * Add Orange (7) on either side - (3,1) and (3,3)
    * Add Orange (7) on the mirrored side - (3,5) and (3,7)

4. **Mirror/Expand, Red(2) at (2,6)**.
    * Mirrored at (2, 2) - value becomes red(2).
    * Add Yellow (4) on either side - (6,5) and (6,7)
    * Add Yellow (4) on the mirrored side - (6,1) and (6,3)

5.  **Mirror/Expand, Blue(1) at (6,6)**.
    * Mirrored at (6, 2) - value becomes blue(1).
    * Add Orange (7) on either side - (6,5) and (6,7)
    * Add Orange (7) on the mirrored side - (6,1) and (6,3)

6. **Mirror/Expand, Red(2) at (7,1)**.
    * Mirrored at (7, 7) - value becomes red(2).
    * Add Yellow (4) on either side - (7,0) and (7,2)
    * Add Yellow (4) on the mirrored side - (7,6) and (7,8)

7. **Overlap**
   * positions (3,1) , (3,3) and (3,5) , (3,7) and (2,2) are overwritten
   * positions (6,5) , (6,7) and (6,1) , (6,3) and (7,7) are overwritten
   * position (7,0) , (7,2) and (7,6) , (7,8) do not have an overlap

This is a very detailed hypothesis, and there's not a clear indication of how the mirroring works. The program requires more information, it will require more analysis with more examples

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
