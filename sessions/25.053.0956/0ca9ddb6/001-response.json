Both grids are 9x9 and contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), blue (1), yellow (4) and orange (7). The transformation seems to involve the creation of new colored objects based on the initial positions of non-zero colored pixels in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

These are the \"key pixels.\"\n2.  **Create Squares:** For each key pixel:\n    *   If the key pixel is red (2), create a 2x2 square of yellow (4) pixels in the output grid. The original red pixel's location should be at row, column indices \\[i-1,j-1] of the 2x2 square.\n    *    If the key pixel is blue (1), create a 3x3 square of orange (7) pixels in the output grid. The original blue pixel location should be the center of the 3x3 square.\n3. **Background:** All other pixels in the output grid remain white (0).\n\nIn summary. The program identifies 'key pixels' in the input. If it is red, it creates a 2x2 yellow square, and if blue, a 3x3 orange square is created in the output, with specific positions relative to the original key pixel position.\n"
