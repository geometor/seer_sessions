Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids are 9x9 and contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), blue (1), yellow (4) and orange (7). The transformation seems to involve the creation of new colored objects based on the initial positions of non-zero colored pixels in the input grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids are 9x9.
  - observation: Cells contain integer values from 0 to 9, corresponding to colors.
  - object: red_pixel
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      location: input grid (row 3, column 2)
    actions:
      creates: yellow_square
  - object: blue_pixel
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      location: input grid (row 6, column 6)
    actions:
      creates: orange_square
  - object: yellow_square
    properties:
      color: yellow (4)
      shape: 2x2 square
      location: output grid, centered around red_pixel location
  - object: orange_square
    properties:
      color: orange (7)
      shape: 3x3 square
      location: output grid, centered around blue_pixel location
  - relationship: The colored pixels in the input grid determine the location and color of squares in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all non-zero pixels in the input grid. These are the "key pixels."
2.  **Create Squares:** For each key pixel:
    *   If the key pixel is red (2), create a 2x2 square of yellow (4) pixels in the output grid. The original red pixel's location should be at row, column indices \[i-1,j-1] of the 2x2 square.
    *    If the key pixel is blue (1), create a 3x3 square of orange (7) pixels in the output grid. The original blue pixel location should be the center of the 3x3 square.
3. **Background:** All other pixels in the output grid remain white (0).

In summary. The program identifies 'key pixels' in the input. If it is red, it creates a 2x2 yellow square, and if blue, a 3x3 orange square is created in the output, with specific positions relative to the original key pixel position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
