Previous Code:
```python
"""
Iterate through all pixels in the input grid. If a pixel is azure (value 8),
determine if it should be changed to blue (value 1). An azure pixel is
changed to blue if it is in the first row of a group of azures in a
vertical line or is in the last row of azure pixel in a vertical line of
group of azures. Create a new grid with the modified pixel values.

Here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed updates:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code's logic is partially correct. It identifies azure (8) pixels and attempts to change them to blue (1) based on vertical adjacency. However, it only considers the *immediate* top and bottom neighbors. The errors in the examples show that the rule should apply to the *entire* vertical line of azure pixels – changing only the top and bottom pixels of the *entire* contiguous vertical line of azure to blue.

The strategy is to refine the logic to correctly identify the start and end of *contiguous* vertical lines of azure pixels. We need to traverse upwards and downwards from each azure pixel until a non-azure pixel (or the edge of the grid) is encountered.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

Here's a more detailed analysis of each example, focusing on where the code's assumptions fail:

*   **Example 1:**

    *   **Input:** A vertical line of two 8s and two sets of vertical lines of 8s of two 8s in the same row, separated by a single 0.
    *   **Expected Output:** Only the top and bottom of each continuous vertical azure sections should be blue.
    *   **Transformed Output:** *All* azure pixels adjacent to a non-azure pixel, even horizontally are changed.
    *   **Error:** The code incorrectly changes azure pixels to blue in the middle of continuous vertical sections. And incorrectly handles horizontally adjacent azure pixels.

*   **Example 2:**

    *   **Input:** Several single azure pixels and connected vertical/horizontal collections
    *   **Expected Output:** Only top and bottom.
    *   **Transformed Output:** Same as Example 1.
    *   **Error:** Same as Example 1.

**YAML Fact Block**

    description: Finds contiguous vertical lines of azure pixels.
  - name: modify_color
    description: Changes the color of specific pixels from azure to blue.

rules:
  - condition: "Pixel is part of a vertical line of azure pixels"
    action: "Change the top and bottom pixels of the line to blue, leaving the middle pixels azure."
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate:** Go through each pixel in the input grid.

2.  **Identify Azure:** Check if the current pixel is azure (value 8).

3.  **Find Vertical Line Boundaries:** If a pixel is azure:
    *   Traverse upwards from the current pixel until a non-azure pixel or the top edge of the grid is reached. This marks the top of the vertical line.
    *   Traverse downwards from the current pixel until a non-azure pixel or the bottom edge of the grid is reached. This marks the bottom of the vertical line.

4.  **Modify Top and Bottom:**
    *   Change the color of the top pixel of the identified vertical line to blue (value 1).
    *   Change the color of the bottom pixel of the identified vertical line to blue (value 1).
    *   Leave the color of all other pixels in the line unchanged (azure).

5.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
