Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, initially with values of 0 (white) and 8 (azure). The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some of the azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels. The positions of the changed pixels appear related to their adjacency to other azure pixels. The overall grid dimensions remain constant.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      value:
        type: integer
        range: [0, 1, 8]
      color:
        mapping:
          0: white
          1: blue
          8: azure
      position:
        type: coordinates
        description: (row, column) within grid

actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: system
    target: pixel
    precondition: "pixel.color == azure"
    effect: "pixel.color becomes blue based on some rule"

relationships:
 - type: adjacency
   relation: "A pixel is adjacent to another if it is directly above, below, left, or right"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Iterate through all pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Check Color:** For each pixel, check if its color is azure (value 8).
3.  **Apply Rule:** If a pixel is azure, determine if it should be changed to blue (value 1).
4. **Specific Color Change Condition:** The azure pixel is changed to blue, If a azure pixel is in first row of group of azures in a vertical line or is in the last row of azure pixel in a vertical line of group of azures.
5.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the modified pixel values, maintaining the original grid dimensions.
