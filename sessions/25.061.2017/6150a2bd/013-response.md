Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements**

*   **Grids:** Both input and output are 3x3 grids.
*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of various colors, represented by single-digit numbers (0-9).
*   **Change in Position:** There's a noticeable change in the position of the colored pixels between the input and output. The input configuration is somehow mirrored or rotated and inverted in the output.
*    **Number inversion**: the numbers seem to invert their positions between the input and the output.

**YAML Fact Block**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 3x3 grids.
  - type: objects
    description: Colored pixels within the grids.
    properties:
      - color: Represented by digits 0-9.
      - position: Row and column index within the grid.
  - type: transformation
    description: The positions of colors are inverted, appearing to be mirrored and flipped.
    details:
      - input_positions: Positions of colors 1,2, and 5 in the first input.
      - output_positions: The position of the colors are at the opposite index of their input.
  - type: action
    name: Invert
    description: The position of colors are flipped vertically and horizontally
```



**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all colored pixels (non-white, where 0 is white) in the input grid.
2.  **Invert Positions** For each object found, invert its position as if you flipped the image vertically, and the horizontally. So the object at `[row, col]` goes to `[2-row, 2-col]`
3.  **Create Output:** Construct a new 3x3 grid. Fill the grid with object colors in the inverted position, the rest of the pixels should be white (0).
