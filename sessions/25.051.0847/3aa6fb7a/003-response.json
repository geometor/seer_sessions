Add a blue (color 1) pixel to fill the empty corner of each L-shape, thus forming 2x2 squares.\n\nThe natural language program and the Python code from the first example correctly describe and implement the transformation observed in this second example as well. The code identifies L-shapes of color 8 and fills their \"missing\" corner with color 1.\n"
