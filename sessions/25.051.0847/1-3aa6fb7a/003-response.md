Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids for the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_objects:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (2x2 block with one cell removed)
        position: Top-right corner of the object is at (0,5)
    - object_2:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (2x2 block with one cell removed), rotated 90 degrees clockwise
        position:  (2,2)
    - object_3:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape, rotated 180 degrees
        position: bottom (6,4)
  output_objects:
      - object_1: # Same as input
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: Top-right corner of the object is at (0,5)
      - object_2: # Same as input
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape, rotated 90 degrees clockwise
        position: (2,2)
      - object_3:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape, rotated 180 degrees
        position: bottom (6,4)
      - object_4:
        color: 1
        shape: single
        position: (1,4)
      - object_5:
        color: 1
        shape: single
        position: (2,3)
      - object_6:
        color: 1
        shape: single
        position: (5,3)
  color_counts:
    input:
        0: 43
        8: 6
    output:
        0: 40
        8: 6
        1: 3
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we identify three L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Detect Change**: New objects of color 1 are generated.

3.  **Analyze Position**: The position of new objects with color 1 corresponds to empty cells to complete each one of the L-shaped objects.

4.  **Transformation Rule:** The input grid has three azure (color 8) L-shaped objects. Add a blue (color 1) pixel to fill the empty corner of each L-shape, thus forming 2x2 squares.

The natural language program and the Python code from the first example correctly describe and implement the transformation observed in this second example as well. The code identifies L-shapes of color 8 and fills their "missing" corner with color 1.
