Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_objects:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (2x2 block with one cell removed)
        position: Top-left corner of the object is at (1,1)
    - object_2:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (2x2 block with one cell removed), rotated 180 degrees
        position: Bottom-right corner of the object is at (5,6)
  output_objects:
    - object_1: # Same as input
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: Top-left corner of the object is at (1,1)
    - object_2: # Same as input
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape, rotated 180 degrees
        position: Bottom-right corner of the object is at (5,6)
    - object_3:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (2,2)
    - object_4:
      color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (4,5)
  color_counts:
    input:
        0: 45
        8: 4
    output:
        0: 43
        8: 4
        1: 2
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we identify two L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure). Object 1 is in the top-left, and Object 2 is in the bottom-right, rotated by 180 degrees.

2.  **Detect Change**: New objects with color 1 are generated.

3.  **Analyze Position**: Object 3 which is of color 1 can be placed in the empty slot of the first object. The empty slot of the second object is filled with the second object of color 1.

4.  **Transformation Rule:** The input grid has two azure (color 8) L-shaped objects. Add a blue (color 1) pixel to fill the empty corner of each L-shape, thus forming 2x2 squares.
