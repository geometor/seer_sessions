Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L-shape'
      position: (1,1) and connected cells
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L-shape'
      position: (3,4) and connected cells
  grid_size: (7,7)

output_grid:
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L-shape'
      position: (1,1) and connected cells
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L-shape'
      position: (3,4) and connected cells
    - color: 1
      shape: 'single cell'
      position: (2,1)
    - color: 1
      shape: 'single cell'
      position: (3,4)
  grid_size: (7,7)
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct L-shaped objects, both composed of azure (color 8) cells. One located in top-left, the other in bottom-right.

2.  **Detect Change**: The L-shapes formed by color 8 are kept, and where each shape began, a color 1 is placed.

3. **Transformation Rule:** The program scans the input, keeps every shape, and adds a blue pixel (color 1) in the starting top-left cell of each color 8 shape.
