One located in top-left, the other in bottom-right.\n\n2.  **Detect Change**: The L-shapes formed by color 8 are kept, and where each shape began, a color 1 is placed.\n\n3. **Transformation Rule:** The program scans the input, keeps every shape, and adds a blue pixel (color 1) in the starting top-left cell of each color 8 shape.\n\n"
