Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      position: (1,1) and (2,1), (2,2)
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse L-shape
      position: (4,4) and (3,4), (3,5)
  background_color: 0

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      position: (1,1) and (2,1), (2,2)
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      position: (1,2)
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse L-shape
      position: (4,4) and (3,4), (3,5)
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      position: (4,5)

  background_color: 0
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two azure (color 8) L-shaped objects. The rest of the grid is filled with the background color (0).

2.  **Detect Change:** Compare the input and output. The azure L-shaped objects remain unchanged. However, a single cell of color blue(1) appears next to the 'leg' of each L shape.

3.  **Describe the rule:** For each azure object, the cell to the right of the bottom-most pixel of the object that is not part of that azure object gets colored blue (color 1).

**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language)**

The transformation rule can be stated as follows:

For each azure (color 8) object, find its bottom-most, non-connected point. Change the adjacent right cell of this point to blue (color 1). If the right cell is already part of the azure object, or if the right cell is out of boundary, do nothing.
