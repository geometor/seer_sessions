**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

The transformation process operates on each non-white cell in the input grid independently. For every non-white cell, we identify its color. If the cell is red (color 2), its orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the output grid are turned yellow (color 4). If the cell is blue (color 1), its orthogonal neighbors in the output grid are turned orange (color 7).  The original non-white cells and any white cells that are not neighbors of these colored cells remain unchanged in the output grid. Essentially, each colored cell in the input grid "emanates" a specific color to its immediate surroundings in the output grid, based on its own color.

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule is applied cell by cell across the input grid to generate the output grid.  For each cell in the input grid, we check its color.

If a cell in the input grid is red (color 2), then in the output grid, its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right cells) are changed to yellow (color 4). The red cell itself remains unchanged in the output grid.

If a cell in the input grid is blue (color 1), then in the output grid, its immediate orthogonal neighbors are changed to orange (color 7). The blue cell itself remains unchanged in the output grid.

If a cell in the input grid is any other color (including white), it remains unchanged in the output grid, and it does not affect its neighbors.

This process is applied independently for each red and blue cell in the input grid. If a cell is a neighbor of both a red and a blue cell, it will be affected by both rules.  However, based on the examples, it seems the transformation is applied independently for each non-white cell without considering overlaps or priorities. If a cell is targeted to be changed by multiple source cells, it will be overwritten based on the order of processing the source cells. However, based on the description and examples, it appears that neighbor cells simply take the color effect of each source cell, without interaction between neighbor modifications from different source cells.
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
