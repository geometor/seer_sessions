Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Block Summary**

```yaml
observations:
  input:
    - object1:
      color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (1,1)  # Top-left corner of the object
    - object2:
      color: 8 (azure)
      shape: reverse L-shape
      position: (3,4)  # Top-left corner of the object
    grid_size: (7, 7)
  output:
    - object1:
      color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (1,1)
    - object2:
      color: 8 (azure)
      shape: reverse L-shape
      position: (3,4)
    - object3:
      color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (1,2)
      
    - object4:
      color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (4,5)
    grid_size: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Description**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two L-shaped objects made of azure (color 8) pixels. One object is formed by the cell (1,1) and its neighbors forming a L. The second one is formed by the cell (3,4) and its neighbors forming an inverse L.

2.  **Persistence:** The azure objects remain unchanged in their shape and position from input to output.

3.  **Insertion:**
    *   A single blue (color 1) pixel is inserted, in the output grid, directly to the right of the top-rightmost cell (1,1) of the first L-shaped object. It is inserted at the position (1,2).
    *   Another blue pixel (color 1) is inserted at the mirrored position across the horizontal symmetry axis. It lies directly to the left of the second inverse L-shaped object, at the position (4,5).

**Transformation Rule (Natural Language Program):**

The transformation preserves the two azure L-shaped objects. It adds two blue pixels. The first is placed next to the right of the vertical segment of the first L-shaped object. The second is put at the mirrored position with respect to a horizontal axis across the center of the grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
