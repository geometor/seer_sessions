One object is formed by the cell (1,1) and its neighbors forming a L. The second one is formed by the cell (3,4) and its neighbors forming an inverse L.\n\n2.  **Persistence:** The azure objects remain unchanged in their shape and position from input to output.\n\n3.  **Insertion:**\n    *   A single blue (color 1) pixel is inserted, in the output grid, directly to the right of the top-rightmost cell (1,1) of the first L-shaped object. It is inserted at the position (1,2).\n    *   Another blue pixel (color 1) is inserted at the mirrored position across the horizontal symmetry axis. It lies directly to the left of the second inverse L-shaped object, at the position (4,5).\n\n**Transformation Rule (Natural Language Program):**\n\nThe transformation preserves the two azure L-shaped objects. It adds two blue pixels. The first is placed next to the right of the vertical segment of the first L-shaped object. The second is put at the mirrored position with respect to a horizontal axis across the center of the grid.\n\n"
