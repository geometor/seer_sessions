            "text": "Here's an assessment of the provided information and a strategy for resolving the errors, along with the requested deliverables:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were too simplistic. While it correctly captured the substitution aspect, it only worked for some number mappings and missed others. The core issue is that the substitution rule is incomplete and needs to incorporate all observed mappings from the training examples, not just a subset based on the first example. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples**: Identify *all* input-output number pairs across all examples.\n2.  **Complete Substitution Rule**: Create a comprehensive substitution rule that accounts for every observed mapping.\n3.  **Revise the natural language program**: Update to reflect the complete substitution rule.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a summary of each example, incorporating observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has 3s, 1s, and 2s. Output has 4s, 5s, and 6s.\n    *   The code transformed 3 to 4 and 2 to 6 correctly, but did not change the 1. It should become a 5.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has 2s, 3s, and 8s. Output has 6s, 4s, and 9s.\n    *   The code transformed 2 to 6, 3 to 4, and 8 to 9 correctly, so a full match.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input has 5s, 8s, and 6s. Output has 1s, 9s, and 2s.\n    *   The code transformed 8 to 9, but did nothing with the 5 or the 6. 5 should map to 1 and 6 should map to 2.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input has 9s, 4s, and 2s. Output has 8s, 3s, and 6s.\n    *   The code transformed 2 to 6, but did nothing with 9 and 4. 9 should go to 8, and 4 should go to 3.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example: 1\n    input_colors: [3, 1, 2]\n    output_colors: [4, 5, 6]\n    mapping: {3: 4, 1: 5, 2: 6}\n  - example: 2\n    input_colors: [2, 3, 8]\n    output_colors: [6, 4, 9]\n    mapping: {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9}\n  - example: 3\n    input_colors: [5, 8, 6]\n    output_colors: [1, 9, 2]\n    mapping: {5: 1, 8: 9, 6: 2}\n  - example: 4\n    input_colors: [9, 4, 2]\n    output_colors: [8, 3, 6]\n    mapping: {9: 8, 4: 3, 2: 6}\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nThe program performs a direct substitution of pixel values based on the following rules:\n\n*   1 becomes 5\n*   2 becomes 6\n*   3 becomes 4\n*   4 becomes 3\n*   5 becomes 1\n*   6 becomes 2\n*   8 becomes 9\n*   9 becomes 8\n\nThe structure (size and shape) of the grid remains unchanged. Only the values within the grid are altered according to this substitution cipher.\n"
