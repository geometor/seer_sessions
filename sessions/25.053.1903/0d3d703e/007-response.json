The input grid consists of the values 2, 3, and 8, representing red, green, and azure pixels, respectively. The output grid consists of the values 6, 4, and 9, which are magenta, yellow and maroon pixels, respectively. The spatial arrangement of the pixels remains constant; only the values (colors) change. The transformation appears to be a simple mapping or substitution of each input value to a corresponding output value.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

The structure of the grid doesn't change, just the values in the cells change.\n"
