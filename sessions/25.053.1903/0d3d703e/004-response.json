This decrement operation is modular, meaning it wraps around. Specifically, when the number 0 is decremented, it becomes 9. The grid dimensions remain constant, and only the values of the elements change according to this circular decrement rule (a circular dial).\n\nExample:\n- 0 becomes 9\n- 1 becomes 0\n- 2 becomes 1\n- 3 becomes 2\n- 4 becomes 3\n- 5 becomes 4\n- 6 becomes 5\n- 7 becomes 6\n- 8 becomes 7\n- 9 becomes 8\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Apply the modular decrement rule: (x - 1) % 10\n    output_grid = (output_grid - 1) % 10\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
