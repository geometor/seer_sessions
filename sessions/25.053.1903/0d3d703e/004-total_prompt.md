Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a simple integer substitution. Every instance of the number 3 is replaced with 4, every instance of the number 1 is replaced with 5 and every instance of 2 is replaced by 6. The grid dimensions (3x3) remain unchanged, and the relative positions of all elements stay the same. Essentially this is can be described as addition of +1 to each element, and elements can only contains single digits, 0-9..

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Apply the substitution rule: 3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6
    output_grid[input_grid == 3] = 4
    output_grid[input_grid == 1] = 5

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While it correctly handled the first example, it failed on subsequent examples because it only considered a limited set of substitutions (3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6). The results clearly show a more general pattern of cyclical increment/decrement, which is related to modular arithmetic of a circular/dial/clock, but not simple increment. The provided natural language transformation program must be redefined.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze all examples**: Examine all input/output pairs to identify the *full* set of transformations, not just the ones present in the first example.
2.  **Identify the modular arithmetic**: Determine the modulus (the size of the cycle) and the direction (increment or decrement).
3.  **Update the natural language program**: Rewrite the description to accurately reflect the *complete* transformation rule. The initial attempt did not establish a relationship with the full, circular, number line (dial).
4.  **Develop facts**: Create a yaml block to contain the relevant information for the natural language program.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary):**

Here's a breakdown of each example, noting the specific discrepancies:

*   **Example 1:** Works as expected (already documented).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `2 3 8`
    *   Expected: `6 4 9`
    *   Actual: `6 4 8`
    *   Discrepancy: 8 should become 9, but remains 8.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `5 8 6`
    *   Expected: `1 9 2`
    *   Actual: `5 8 6`
    *   Discrepancy: 5 should become 1, 8 should become 9, 6 should become 2. None of the transformations occurred.
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: `9 4 2`
    *   Expected: `8 3 6`
    *   Actual: `9 4 6`
    *   Discrepancy: 9 should become 8, 4 should become 3, 2 became 6 as per initial, incorrect hypothesis.

From these discrepancies, we can infer that a simple substitution is insufficient. There's a circular increment/decrements happening, which, after some investigation, turns out to be decrementing with wrap around.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task: 002
objects:
  - description: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
transformation_rule:
  type: modular_arithmetic
  operation: decrement
  modulus: 10 # Integers from 0 to 9, then wrapping back to 9
  details:
    - "Each element in the input grid is decremented by 1. If the element is 0, the transformation wraps the result to 9 (0 - 1 becomes 9 due to the circular dial)."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule takes each number (representing a color) in the input grid and decrements it by one. This decrement operation is modular, meaning it wraps around. Specifically, when the number 0 is decremented, it becomes 9. The grid dimensions remain constant, and only the values of the elements change according to this circular decrement rule (a circular dial).

Example:
- 0 becomes 9
- 1 becomes 0
- 2 becomes 1
- 3 becomes 2
- 4 becomes 3
- 5 becomes 4
- 6 becomes 5
- 7 becomes 6
- 8 becomes 7
- 9 becomes 8

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # change output pixels
