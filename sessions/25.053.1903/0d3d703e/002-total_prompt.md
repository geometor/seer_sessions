# Example

**input:**
```
3 1 2
3 1 2
3 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70E23E25BA00>

**output:**
```
4 5 6
4 5 6
4 5 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70E23E25BEE0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. Each integer in the input grid seems to be mapped to a different integer in the output grid, suggesting a simple substitution or addition rule. The spatial arrangement (3x3 grid) is preserved during the transformation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color: mapped to integer value
      - position: row and column index

actions:
  - type: substitution
    description: Each integer in the input is replaced with a corresponding integer in the output.
    mapping:
        3: 4
        1: 5
        2: 6

relationships:
  - type: one-to-one mapping
    description:  Each input integer has a unique corresponding output integer.
  - type: spatial preservation
    description: The grid structure and element positions remain constant during the transformation.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a simple integer substitution. Every instance of the number 3 is replaced with 4, every instance of the number 1 is replaced with 5 and every instance of 2 is replaced by 6. The grid dimensions (3x3) remain unchanged, and the relative positions of all elements stay the same. Essentially this is can be described as addition of +1 to each element, and elements can only contains single digits, 0-9..

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
