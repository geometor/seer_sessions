Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule takes each number (representing a color) in the input grid and decrements it by one. This decrement operation is modular, meaning it wraps around. Specifically, when the number 0 is decremented, it becomes 9. The grid dimensions remain constant, and only the values of the elements change according to this circular decrement rule (a circular dial).

Example:
- 0 becomes 9
- 1 becomes 0
- 2 becomes 1
- 3 becomes 2
- 4 becomes 3
- 5 becomes 4
- 6 becomes 5
- 7 becomes 6
- 8 becomes 7
- 9 becomes 8

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting Python code were incorrect. The core misunderstanding is that the transformation isn't a simple decrement of each pixel value. The provided code implements `(x - 1) % 10`, which *does* decrement and wrap around, but this is not what the examples show when combined together. There is a relationship between inputs and outputs, but it is *not* consistent across all the examples. Therefore, the concept of a *single* consistent transformation rule is flawed. Each example seems to represent a constant addition of some value to all the cells, but with different addition constants.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** We need to discard the idea of a single, universal decrement rule. Instead, focus on the *relationship* between the input and output grids *within each example*.
2.  **Calculate Offsets:** For *each* example, determine the numerical difference (modulo 10) between corresponding input and output pixel values. This will reveal the specific transformation rule *for that example*.
3. **Describe Per-Example Rules:** Create a natural language program that handles the per-example transformation, rather than a global transformation.
4.  **YAML Facts:** Update the YAML to reflect the per-example nature of the transformations.

**Metrics and Observations (per example):**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including the calculated offset:

*   **Example 1:**

    *   Input: `[[3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6]]`
    *   Observed Output (from previous code): `[[2, 0, 1], [2, 0, 1], [2, 0, 1]]`
    *   Offset Calculation:
        *   `4 - 3 = 1`
        *   `5 - 1 = 4`
        *   `6 - 2 = 4`
        * The offset seems inconsistent. Let's calculate it modulo 10:
        *(4-3)%10 = 1*
        *(5-1)%10 = 4*
        *(6-2)%10 = 4*
     *Observation: It appears that the add value is not consistent across the entire grid.*
*   **Example 2:**

    *   Input: `[[2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9]]`
    *   Observed output: `[[1, 2, 7], [1, 2, 7], [1, 2, 7]]`
    *   Offset Calculation (modulo 10):
     *(6-2)%10 = 4*
     *(4-3)%10 = 1*
     *(9-8)%10 = 1*
*   **Example 3:**

    *   Input: `[[5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2]]`
    *    Observed output: `[[4, 7, 5], [4, 7, 5], [4, 7, 5]]`
    *   Offset Calculation (modulo 10):
      *(1-5)%10 = 6*
      *(9-8)%10 = 1*
      *(2-6)%10 = 6*

*   **Example 4:**

    *   Input: `[[9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6]]`
    *   Observed output: `[[8, 3, 1], [8, 3, 1], [8, 3, 1]]`
    *   Offset Calculation (modulo 10):
        *(8-9)%10 = 9*
        *(3-4)%10 = 9*
        *(6-2)%10 = 4*

**Natural Language Program:**

Each example represents a different transformation. There isn't one global transformation; instead there appears to be a per-cell addition operation.

For each example:
1.  The input is a grid of numbers.
2. The output is the result of adding a value to the input on a cell-by-cell basis.
3. The added values must be calculated modulo 10.  `(output_cell - input_cell) % 10`
4. The values added are different across the different examples, and also vary across cells *within* an example

The previous assumption of a *single* transformation rule across all training examples appears incorrect.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
