The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The input grid appears to be transformed into the output grid through a combination of duplication and rearrangement of elements, seemingly based on specific patterns. The most obvious change is an increase of rows, with a specific pixel rearrangement rule.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
