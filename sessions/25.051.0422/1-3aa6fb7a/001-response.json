Two are 2x1 vertical lines, and two are 1x2 horizontal lines.\n\n2.  **Observe Changes**: The first vertical line has been filled in its right neighbor cell with blue color. The second vertical line has been filled in its left neighbor cell with blue color.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule:** For the two vertical lines, we fill the directly adjacent cells with color blue: for the first vertical azure line, the right neighbor; for the second vertical azure line, the left neighbor.\n\nIn summary, the transformation involves adding blue (color 1) pixels adjacent to the right and to the left of the two vertical azure lines. The azure and white objects remain unchanged.\n"
