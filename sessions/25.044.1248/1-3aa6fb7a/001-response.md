Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids. Here's my step-by-step description:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The primary objects are squares of color '8' (which appears to be light blue).

2.  **Locate Specific Predicates:** Find the '8' colored squares that are:
    *   Along the top edge of any contiguous block of 8.
    *   Directly to the left of another '8'
    And
    *   Along the bottom edge of any contiguos block of 8.
    *   Directly to the right of another '8'.

3.  **Transformation Action:**
    *   Change the color of the square from 8 to 1.

**In simpler terms:**

The rule appears to be: Change to a '1' the first blue square of the first row of a blue shape and, also, the last blue square of the last row of a blue shape.

I've focused on the actions, properties, and objects. I believe these are sufficient for describing this transformation.
