"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** The primary objects are squares of color '8' (which appears to be light blue).

2.  **Locate Specific Predicates:** Find the '8' colored squares that are:
    *   Along the top edge of any contiguous block of 8.
    *   Directly to the left of another '8'
    And
    *   Along the bottom edge of any contiguos block of 8.
    *   Directly to the right of another '8'.

3.  **Transformation Action:**
    *   Change the color of the square from 8 to 1.
