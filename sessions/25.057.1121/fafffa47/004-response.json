            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to identify either the top-left or bottom-right object in the input grid and use its dimensions to match the output grid. This approach is too simplistic and doesn't account for the complexities of the transformations. It worked for examples where the output was simply the object from the bottom right of the image, but failed when there were extra changes. The current code tries to match on the size of the object, but also needs to correctly copy the object from the input.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Improve Object Identification:** The current `find_top_left_object` and `get_object_bounds` functions are a good start, but we need to make sure we are not missing objects.\n\n2.  **Accurate Transformation Logic:** The core issue is that simply identifying object sizes isn't enough. We must perform these key steps.\n    - extract the object at the bottom-right of the input\n    - change the object color\n    - ensure that object is positioned and sized correctly in the output.\n\n3. **Handle Color Changes**\n    - The provided examples show the object color changes from the input to the output.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution results):**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the provided examples and the results from the code execution:\n\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"bottom_right_coordinate\": (15, 16),\n        \"bottom_right_object\": (4, 1),\n        \"output_matches\": \"none\",\n        \"top_left_object\": (3, 3),\n    },\n    {\n        \"bottom_right_coordinate\": (11, 16),\n        \"bottom_right_object\": (8, 1),\n        \"output_matches\": \"none\",\n        \"top_left_object\": (0, 0),\n    },\n    {\n        'bottom_right_coordinate': (15, 16),\n        'bottom_right_object': (4, 1),\n        'output_matches': 'none',\n        'top_left_object': (3, 3)\n    }\n]\n```\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 20x20 grid with a 3x3 gray object (5) in the top-left and a 4x1 green object (3) in the bottom-right.\n    *   Output: 3x3 grid, all cells are red (2)\n    *   Code Result: The code detects bottom-right object's starting position is row 15, col 16, size is (4, 1), it detects that there is no size match with a topleft size of (3,3)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 20x20 grid with a 8x1 green object in the bottom right\n    *   Output: 4 x 4 red (2) object\n    *   Code Result: The bottom-right object coordinate is row 11 col 16, object size (8,1), no size match, topleft is empty\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 20x20 with 3x3 orange object (7) in top-left and a 4x1 yellow object in the bottom right\n    *    Output: 10 x 10, where cells forming a rotated 'L' shape, colored red, exists.\n    *   Code Result:  bottom-right object coordinate at 15, 16, with a size of (4,1). output does not match size, topleft is (3,3)\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - color: 5  # gray\n        shape: rectangle\n        dimensions: [3, 3]\n        position: top-left\n      - color: 3  # green\n        shape: rectangle\n        dimensions: [4, 1]\n        position: bottom-right\n    output_object:\n      color: 2 #red\n      shape: rectangle\n      dimensions: [3,3]\n      notes: output object dimensions match input top-left\n    transformation: copy_and_recolor\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_objects:\n      - color: 3  # green\n        shape: rectangle\n        dimensions: [8, 1]\n        position: bottom-right\n    output_object:\n      color: 2 # red\n      shape: rectangle\n      dimensions: [4,4]\n      notes: output object dimensions do not match input\n    transformation: copy_and_recolor\n\n  - example_id: 3\n    input_objects:\n      - color: 7  # orange\n        shape: rectangle\n        dimensions: [3, 3]\n        position: top-left\n      - color: 4  # yellow\n        shape: rectangle\n        dimensions: [4, 1]\n        position: bottom-right\n    output_object:\n      color: 2 # red\n      shape: L-shape\n      dimensions: [10,10]\n      notes: output object is not a rectangle, composed from bottom right object\n    transformation: copy_and_recolor\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Object:** Find the contiguous object in the bottom-right corner of the input grid. An object is defined as a group of connected pixels of the same color.\n\n2.  **Extract Object:** Copy the bottom-right object.\n\n3.  **Recolor Object:** Change all pixels in the copied object to red (color code 2).\n\n4. **Output:** Create an output grid with the correct dimensions and the recolored object.\n    - Example 1: size is 3 x 3\n    - Example 2: size is 4 x 4\n    - Example 3: the extracted object pixels are arranged to form an L-shape grid.\n\n"
