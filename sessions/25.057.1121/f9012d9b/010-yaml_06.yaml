facts:
  - task_id: "ARC Challenge - Task X"
  - objective: "Determine a single color value to represent the entire input grid."
  - input:
      type: "2D grid (NxN)"
      properties:
        - "Pixels with color values 0-9"
  - output:
      type: "1x1 grid"
      properties:
        - "Single pixel representing the derived color"
  - rules:
      - "If input grid contains colors other than white (0), output is single most frequent of these colors. Output will always be the highest value if frequency is identical for all colors in grid"
      - "If all the input is only white/0, the output is also white"
