1.  **Identify Target Region:** Locate a 2x2 region within the input grid.
2.  **Extract:** extract this region in it's spatial arrangement.
3.  **Output the region:** The program takes this identified 2x2 region and creates it as output. It appears the location is a function of the location and arrangement of like colored pixels.
4.  The upper left of the output grid is the upper left of the first 2x2 region of identical pixels found when searching from the upper left.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
