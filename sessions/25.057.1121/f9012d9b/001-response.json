The colors in the input grid seem to be reduced in the output, with only blue (1) and red (2) appearing. The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid. The presence of white (0) in the input, and its absence in the output, suggests a filtering or selection process. The specific arrangement of blues and reds in the output seems to correspond to a sub-region of the input, but not in a directly positional way. It's more focused on top-left object.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
