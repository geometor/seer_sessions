task: 868de0fa
objects:
  input_grid:
    description: A 2x2 grid of pixels, each with a color value (0-9).
    dimensions: 2x2
  output_grid:
    description: A 4x4 grid of pixels, representing a tiled version of the input grid.
    dimensions: 4x4
  pixels:
    description: Individual cells within the grids, represented by integer values (0-9).

actions:
  tiling:
    description: The input grid is replicated four times to create the output grid. The input is tiled horizontally and vertically.
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid

observations:
  - The input grid is always 2x2.
  - The output grid is always 4x4.
  - Each example shows the entire input grid replicated. The output is the same input grid, tiled to be twice as wide and twice as tall
