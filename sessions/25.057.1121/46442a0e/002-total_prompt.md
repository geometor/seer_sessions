## Example 1

**input:**
```
8 6
6 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x73D2CE1536D0>

**output:**
```
8 6 6 8
6 8 8 6
6 8 8 6
8 6 6 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x73D2CE1530D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small 2x2 grid into a larger 4x4 grid. The input grid consists of two colors (represented by digits 8 and 6) arranged in a checkerboard pattern. The output grid expands this pattern, essentially replicating the 2x2 input four times to create the 4x4 output. The relative positions of the colors are maintained.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 2x2
    elements:
      - color: 8 # azure
        positions: [[0,0], [1,1]]
      - color: 6 # magenta
        positions: [[0,1], [1,0]]
    pattern: checkerboard

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements:
      - color: 8 # azure
        positions: [[0,0], [1,1], [0,3], [1,2], [2,1], [3,0], [2,2], [3,3]]
      - color: 6  # magenta
        positions: [[0,1], [1,0], [0,2], [1,3], [2,0], [3,1], [3,2], [2,3]]
    pattern: checkerboard

  - transformation:
    type: replication
    description: The input 2x2 grid is replicated four times to form the 4x4 output grid.
    rule: The top-left cell of the input becomes the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right 2x2 quadrants of the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input:** Receive a 2x2 input grid with a checkerboard pattern of two colors (8 and 6).
2.  **Replicate:** Replicate the 2x2 input grid.
3. **Create output** Duplicate the 2x2 input grid four times.
4. **Assemble output** Arrange the duplicated 2x2 grids in a 2x2 pattern forming a 4x4 output grid. Maintain the original relative positioning of elements.

In essence, the transformation takes the original 2x2 and expands each of the 4 original pixels into 4 pixels in a 2x2 area.


```
1 2     1 2 1 2
3 4 --> 3 4 3 4
        1 2 1 2
        3 4 3 4
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
