The colors are represented by integers. The primary colors involved seem to be orange (7) and azure (8). The transformation appears to involve some form of expansion or duplication of the original grid, with a specific pattern. The output grid seems to be created by outlining.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
