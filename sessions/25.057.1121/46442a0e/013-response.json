The colors in the input grid appear to be preserved and rearranged in the output grid, suggesting a pattern-based expansion or tiling. The output grid seems to \"frame\" a core section with the elements from the input. There appears to be some form of mirroring and/or rotation, or a specific layout rule being applied.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
