Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Two separate 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal shapes.
      positions:
        - Top-left corner: (1,1) [2x1 shape]
        - Bottom-right corner: (3,4) [1x2 shape]
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: Background
      positions:
        - Everywhere else

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Same as input.
      positions:
        - Same as input
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: Single cells (1x1)
      positions:
        - (1,2) [Next to top-left azure shape]
        - (4,5) [Next to bottom-right azure shape.]
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: Background
      positions:
        - Everywhere else
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all objects (contiguous regions) of color 8 (azure) in the input grid. There are two azure objects in this example

2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** Maintain the azure objects exactly as they are (shape, position, and color) in the output grid.

3.  **Introduce Blue Pixel:** For each identified azure object find the corner:
    - In the upper part consider the upper-right corner
    - In the lower part consider the lower-left corner
     Place a single pixel of color 1 (blue) one to the right or to the left respectively, in the output grid. If the azure object touches the edge of the grid, don't insert any pixel in the touching direction.

**Explanation and Reasoning**

The core concept here is the preservation of the azure objects and the conditional introduction of blue pixels based on their positions. The rule appears to find a specific type of corner, and then adding blue pixels in the input grid.
