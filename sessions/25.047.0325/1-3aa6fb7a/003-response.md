Okay, let's analyze the second example provided.

**Observations:**

*   **Input:** The input grid contains three separate azure (color 8) objects. One is a 2x1 vertical rectangle at the middle-bottom, one is a 2x1 vertical rectangle at top-right, one is 2x2 shape at the middle-left.
*   **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that a blue (color 1) pixel appears to the immediate left of the right-most azure pixel in each object.

**YAML Summary:**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: (6,3)
    count: 2
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: (0,4)
    count: 2
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x2
    position: (2,2)
    count: 4
  - color: 1
    shape: 1x1 pixel
    position: relative to object 8
    count: 3

transformations:
  - action: add
    color: 1
    position: left of the rightmost pixel of object 8
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  Identify all azure (color 8) objects.
2.  For each azure object, locate the right-most pixel.
3.  Place a blue (color 1) pixel immediately to the left of this right-most pixel.
4. Leave other cells unchanged.
