There are two azure objects in this example\n\n2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** Maintain the azure objects exactly as they are (shape, position, and color) in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Introduce Blue Pixel:** For each identified azure object find the corner:\n    - In the upper part consider the upper-right corner\n    - In the lower part consider the lower-left corner\n     Place a single pixel of color 1 (blue) one to the right or to the left respectively, in the output grid. If the azure object touches the edge of the grid, don't insert any pixel in the touching direction.\n\n**Explanation and Reasoning**\n\nThe core concept here is the preservation of the azure objects and the conditional introduction of blue pixels based on their positions. The rule appears to find a specific type of corner, and then adding blue pixels in the input grid.\n"
