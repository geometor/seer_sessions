## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x735964068490>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7359640699C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9), corresponding to a specific color. The transformation seems to involve a rotation of the grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by integer values (0-9)
  - transformation: rotation
    details:
      - direction: appears to be counter-clockwise or clockwise with a potential reflection
      - angle: 90 degrees, needs confirmation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The colors of the pixels are preserved during the rotation. Visualize taking the input grid and turning it so the top row becomes the rightmost column, right column becomes bottom, and bottom row becomes left.

Or written another way

1.  Read the input grid.
2.  Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise.
3. Output is the rotated grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
