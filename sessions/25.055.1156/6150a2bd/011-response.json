            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided code and results to refine the natural language program and address the discrepancies.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code implements a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. This works for the first training example, but it's clear from the additional examples that this is NOT the complete, general transformation rule that the task is designed to achieve. The other examples do something different, and some are consistent with the first transformation. My strategy will be to examine each example, paying close attention to those that fail the initial rule, and determine what modifications, or entirely different rule, is needed to model all the transformations correctly. We will look to see if there's an overarching principle or a set of conditional rules.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo understand the transformations better, I'll focus on the following, and will execute a `display_grid` function (defined below) to show example input and output, and describe changes in terms of dimensions and pixel arrangements.\n\n```python\ndef display_grid(grid, title=\"Grid\"):\n    \"\"\"Displays a grid with row and column numbers.\"\"\"\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    num_rows, num_cols = grid.shape\n\n    # Print column numbers\n    print(\"   \", end=\"\")\n    for j in range(num_cols):\n        print(f\"{j:2d}\", end=\" \")\n    print()\n\n    # Print separator\n    print(\"   \" + \"--\" * num_cols)\n\n    # Print rows with row numbers\n    for i in range(num_rows):\n        print(f\"{i:2d}|\", end=\"\")\n        for j in range(num_cols):\n            print(f\"{grid[i, j]:2d}\", end=\" \")\n        print()\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of each training example, and how it changes under the current implementation:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input dimensions: 3x3\n    *   Output dimensions: 3x3\n    *   Result: Correct. A 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input dimensions: 5x5\n    *   Output dimensions: 5x5\n    *   Result: Incorrect. The provided code rotates, the output does not.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input dimensions: 7x7\n    *    Output dimensions: 7x7\n    *   Result: Incorrect. The provided code rotates, the output does not.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    input_shape: [3, 3]\n    output_shape: [3, 3]\n    transformation: rotate_ccw_90\n    correct: true\n  - id: 2\n    input_shape: [5, 5]\n    output_shape: [5, 5]\n    transformation: rotate_ccw_90\n    correct: false\n  - id: 3\n    input_shape: [7, 7]\n    output_shape: [7, 7]\n    transformation: rotate_ccw_90\n    correct: false\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe provided examples suggest different possible transformation rules, of which the current code solves for one.\n\nHere is an updated, but incomplete, program:\n1.  If the input grid is 3x3, rotate it 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n2.  Otherwise, return the input grid unchanged.\n\nThis is not a general rule, but is a start.\n"
