            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code attempts a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation and coordinate swap. However, the results clearly indicate that the transformation is incorrect, especially when considering that after rotation, the dimensions of the grid also change. The output grids keep the same shape as the input grids while, just mirroring the input (or swapping x and y). We need a major strategy shift to handle the actual transformations, which involve not just rotation and swapping, but also a change of grid shape that makes the initial approach not suitable.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Correct Rotation:**\u00a0The main problem is how rotation is currently implemented. We need a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation, swapping the input's row to be the output column, and the input columns to be the output rows, reversing their order.\n2.  **Dimension change**: Resizing the grid is a crucial part. After rotating 90 degrees counter-clockwise, the dimensions must swap: the original width will be the new height, and the original height will be the new width.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example Analysis):**\n\nI will analyze the provided examples, focusing on input/output dimensions, object identification, and apparent transformations. Since I do not have direct access to visualizing or running code, I'll describe my assumptions and request code execution to verify.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input dimensions: 3x5\n    *   Output dimensions: 5x3\n    *   Expected: Correct rotation (90 degrees counter-clockwise).\n    *   Observed (from code): No rotation and incorrect coordinate swapping.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input dimensions: 4x2\n    *   Output dimensions: 2x4\n    *   Expected: Correct rotation (90 degrees counter-clockwise).\n    *   Observed (from code): No rotation and incorrect coordinate swapping.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input dimensions: 7x7\n    *   Output dimensions: 7x7\n    *   Expected: Correct rotation (90 degrees counter-clockwise).\n    *   Observed (from code): No rotation and incorrect coordinate swapping.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task_id: \"0d3d703e\"\n  - transformation_type: \"rotation\"\n  - rotation_direction: \"counter-clockwise\"\n  - rotation_angle: 90\n  - input_objects:\n    - description: \"grid of pixels\"\n      properties:\n        - dimensions: \"variable\"\n        - values: \"integers representing colors\"\n  - output_objects:\n    - description: \"rotated grid of pixels\"\n      properties:\n        - dimensions: \"swapped input dimensions\"\n        - values: \"same as input, but repositioned\"\n  - actions:\n    - description: \"rotate the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise\"\n      details: \"Each pixel (x, y) in the input moves to (y, input_height - 1 - x) in the output.\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid where the width is the height of the input grid, and the height is the width of the input grid.\n2.  **Rotation:** Iterate through each pixel of the *input* grid. For each pixel at position (x, y), place its value in the *output* grid at position (y, input\\_height - 1 - x). This effectively rotates the grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n3.  **Output:** The transformed output grid is the result of the rotation.\n"
