Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies horizontal azure lines and attempts to place blue pixels to their immediate left and right. However, it fails to accurately place the blue pixels. The core issue is the logic makes incorrect assumptions - specifically it assumes that a pixel should be placed on the right *and* left, when the examples show the correct logic is **either** the left **or** the right, but not both. The placement of the blue pixel is on *either* side of the azure line, relative to that edge.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine the Rule:** The natural language program should be rephrased to clarify blue placement should be either to the left *or* the right, but never both.

2.  **Correct the Edge Detection:** Make sure the logic is to compare start and end index of the line, and only act for a pixel at the terminal end.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input Shape:** (7, 7)
*   **Output Shape:** (7, 7)
*   **Azure Lines:**
    *   (1, 1, 1) - length 1
    *   (2, 1, 2) - length 2
    *   (3, 4, 5) - length 2
    *   (4, 5, 5) - length 1
* **Expected blue pixels:**
    * line (1,1,1) - right side, at (1,2)
    * line (2,1,2) - none
    * line (3,4,5) - left side, at (3,3)
    * line (4,5,5) - left side, at (4,4)
* **Error Analysis:** Blue pixels were incorrectly added to the left *and* right
    of every azure line.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input Shape:** (7, 7)
*   **Output Shape:** (7, 7)
* **Azure lines:**
    * (0, 4, 5) - length 2
    * (1, 5, 5) - length 1
    * (2, 2, 2) - length 1
    * (3, 2, 3) - length 2
    * (5, 4, 4) - length 1
    * (6, 3, 4) - length 2
* **Expected blue pixels:**
    * line (0, 4, 5) - none
    * line (1, 5, 5) - left side, at (1,4)
    * line (2, 2, 2) - right side, at (2,3)
    * line (3, 2, 3) - none
    * line (5, 4, 4) - left side, at (5,3)
    * line (6, 3, 4) - none
* **Error Analysis:** Same as Example 1 - blue pixels were incorrectly added on
    both sides.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: horizontal_line
    color: azure
    properties:
      start_row: int
      start_col: int
      end_col: int
      length: int
      left_edge: boolean
      right_edge: boolean

actions:
  - name: add_blue_pixel
    description: Place a single blue pixel adjacent to the azure line
    conditions:
      - if azure line does not touch right edge, place blue on right.
      - if azure line does not touch left edge, place blue on left.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Lines:** Find all horizontal, contiguous lines of azure (8) pixels. A line is defined by its starting row, starting column, and ending column.
2.  **Check for Edge Contact:** For each azure line:
    *   If the line's ending column is *not* the last column of the grid (right edge), place a single blue (1) pixel immediately to the right of the line's last pixel.
    *   If the line's starting column is *not* the first column of the grid (left edge), place a single blue (1) pixel immediately to the left of the line's first pixel.
3. **All other pixels:** should be set to 0 (white).
4.  **Output Grid:** Create a new grid containing only the azure lines and any newly placed blue pixels, all other cells are zero.
