1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Mark Adjacent Cells:** For each identified azure pixel, examine its neighboring cells (up, down, left, and right).
    - if an azure pixel is to the right of another azure pixel, place a blue pixel to its immediate right
    - if an azure pixel is to the left of another azure pixel, place a blue pixel to its immediate left
3.  **Output:** Create the output grid with the original azure pixels and the newly placed blue (1) pixels. All other cells remain white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
