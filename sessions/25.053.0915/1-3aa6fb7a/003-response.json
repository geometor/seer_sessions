            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a partial understanding of the rule, focusing only on placing blue pixels to the *right* or *left* of *adjacent* azure pixels. The provided examples reveal a more specific pattern. It's not simply about adjacency, but about creating a chain effect of inserting blue to the *right* or *left* of the last azure in a sequence of azure pixels. The code also incorrectly places blue pixels in between azure pixels.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Correct the placement logic:** Focus on identifying the edges (first and last) of continuous horizontal lines of azure pixels. Insert the blue pixel outside of this continuous block.\n2.  **Review Results:** Understand where the code is placing the blue pixels and why, make appropriate adjustments.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including observations and metrics:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** A 7x7 grid with two horizontal lines of azure pixels.\n*   **Expected Output:** Blue pixels added to the right of the azure line in row 2 and to the left of the azure line in row 5.\n*   **Transformed Output:** Incorrect. Blue pixels inserted on both sides of *all* azure pixels.\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   `pixels_off`: 6 (Indicates 6 pixels differ between expected and transformed)\n    *   `size_correct`: True\n    *   `color_palette_correct`: True\n    *   `correct_pixel_counts`: False\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** A 7x7 grid with multiple azure pixels, some adjacent.\n*   **Expected Output:** Blue pixels added based on horizontal runs of azure.\n*   **Transformed Output:** Incorrect placement of blue pixels.\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   `pixels_off`: 9\n    *   `size_correct`: True\n    *   `color_palette_correct`: True\n    *   `correct_pixel_counts`: False\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task_id: 002\n  - objects:\n    - color: azure (8)\n      type: pixel_group\n      properties:\n        - forms_horizontal_lines: true\n        - variable_length: true\n    - color: blue (1)\n      type: inserted_pixel\n      properties:\n        - placement: adjacent_to_azure_lines\n        - direction: conditional # Either left or right, not both\n        - insertion_rule: \"outside of last azure in an azure sequence\"\n  - actions:\n    - type: insertion\n      description: Insert blue pixels based on the extent of horizontal azure lines.\n      details:\n        - condition: \"azure line exists\"\n          action: \"if an azure line of any length is identified,\n                    place 1 blue pixel to the right if the end of the line\n                    is not the edge of the grid.\n                    place one blue pixel to the left if the start of the\n                    line is not the beginning of the grid\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Lines:** Find all horizontal, contiguous lines of azure (8) pixels. A line can be of length 1 or more.\n2.  **Check Right Edge:** For each azure line, check if it extends to the right edge of the grid.\n    *   If the line *does not* extend to the right edge, place a single blue (1) pixel immediately to the right of the last azure pixel in that line.\n3. **Check Left Edge:** For each azure line, check it extends to the left edge of the grid.\n    * If the line *does not* extend to the left edge, place a single blue (1) pixel immediately to the left of the first azure pixel in that line.\n4. **All other pixels:** should be 0 (white).\n5.  **Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the original azure lines and the newly placed blue pixels.\n\n"
