Okay, here's a breakdown of the example input-output pair and a plan to figure out the transformation:

**General Assessment:**

The input and output are both 3x3 grids. The values in the grids are single digits, representing colors. It appears there's a consistent mapping between the input and output digits, meaning the transformation is likely a simple color replacement.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Data Extraction:** Use code execution to extract the numerical values from the input and output grids.
2.  **Mapping:** Create a dictionary or similar structure to map input values to output values.
3.  **Verification:** Check if the mapping is consistent across all cells.
4.  **Natural Language Program:** Describe the transformation rule as a simple color replacement.
5.  **YAML Documentation:** Create a YAML block summarizing the findings (objects: grids, pixels; properties: color/value; actions: replacement).

**Gather Metrics (Code Execution):**




*code_execution:*

```python
import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([
    [2, 3, 8],
    [2, 3, 8],
    [2, 3, 8]
])

output_grid = np.array([
    [6, 4, 9],
    [6, 4, 9],
    [6, 4, 9]
])

# Create a mapping
mapping = {}
for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
    for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
        input_val = input_grid[i, j]
        output_val = output_grid[i, j]
        if input_val not in mapping:
            mapping[input_val] = output_val
        elif mapping[input_val] != output_val:
            print(f"Inconsistent mapping found: {input_val} maps to {mapping[input_val]} and {output_val}")

print(f"{mapping=}")

#verify by transforming
transformed_grid = np.vectorize(mapping.get)(input_grid)
print(f"{transformed_grid=}")
print(f"{np.array_equal(transformed_grid, output_grid)=}")



```


*code_execution_result:*

outcome: 1

```
mapping={np.int64(2): np.int64(6), np.int64(3): np.int64(4), np.int64(8): np.int64(9)}
transformed_grid=array([[6, 4, 9],
       [6, 4, 9],
       [6, 4, 9]])
np.array_equal(transformed_grid, output_grid)=True

```

**YAML Documentation:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 3x3 matrix of pixels
    properties:
      - rows: 3
      - columns: 3
  - type: pixel
    description: Individual cell in the grid
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - color: Represented by the integer value

actions:
  - type: replacement
    description: Each pixel's value in the input grid is replaced with a corresponding value in the output grid.
    mapping:
      2: 6
      3: 4
      8: 9
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a simple color replacement. Each pixel's numerical value in the input grid is replaced with a new value according to the following mapping:

*   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).
*   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).
*   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9).

The spatial arrangement of the pixels remains unchanged; only their values are altered based on this fixed mapping.
