"""
Transforms an input grid by changing specific azure (8) pixels to blue (1).

1.  Identify Azure Pixels: Find the locations of all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Identify Blue Pixels: Find the locations of all blue (1) pixels in the output grid.
3.  Determine Changes: Compare the locations. If a blue pixel's location in the output grid corresponds to an
    azure pixel's location in the input grid, it means that the azure pixel at that location was changed to blue.
4.  Change Identified Pixels: Change the identified azure pixels to blue.
5.  Preserve Other Pixels: All other pixels remain unchanged.
