Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Count:** Count the number of cells with the value '1' (blue cells) in the input grid.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid. The dimensions will be 1 x N, where N is the count obtained in step 1.
3.  **Fill:** Fill all the cells of the new grid with the value '1' (make them blue).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Count the number of cells with value '1' in the input grid.
    count_of_ones = np.count_nonzero(input_grid == 1)

    # Create a new grid with dimensions 1 x N, where N is the count of ones.
    output_grid = np.ones((1, count_of_ones), dtype=int)

    # The output grid is already filled with '1's due to np.ones().

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
