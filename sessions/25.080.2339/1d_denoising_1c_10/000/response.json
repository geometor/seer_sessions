The transformation seems to focus on replacing certain colored pixels with black (0) pixels, effectively \"erasing\" parts of the original input. The core challenge is to discern the rule that dictates which pixels are erased and which are preserved. The position of the non-zero color seems important.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

It's like finding the largest \"island\" of a single color and setting the \"sea\" (all surrounding pixels) to black (0).\n"
