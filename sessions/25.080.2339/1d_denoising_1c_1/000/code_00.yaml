facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are all 1x32.
  - observation: |
      All examples contain a single contiguous block of a single non-zero color.
  - observation: |
     In all training examples the color of the contiguous object is the same in the input and output.
  - observation: |
      In all examples, single isolated non-zero pixels appear to be removed.
  - observation: |
      The main block of color remains unchanged except the pixels beside it.
  - rule: |
     Pixels which are alone (not connected on either side to color of main body), change to black.
