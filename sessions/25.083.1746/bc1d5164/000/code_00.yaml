facts:
  - observation: Input grids have varying dimensions.
  - observation: Output grids are always 3x3.
  - observation: Input grids have a non-zero color forming a border.
  - observation: Output grids use a single color (besides 0).
  - observation: Output single color is always the same color along the input grid border.
  - observation: All input non-zero color borders are made of only one color.
  - inference: The output grid is a 3x3 representation of the input grid's border color.
  - inference: The transformation compresses, or summarizes, the input border.
