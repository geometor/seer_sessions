            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, which it handled with partial success. However, it failed to accurately transform the other examples. The primary issue is that the code assumes the output will always be a 3x3 grid filled with the border color and 0, with a cross shape. Instead of a cross, we need to recreate just the corners. Additionally, the previous solution did not set all the expected output pixels to the correct color. A good strategy will be to:\n1. Identify the non-zero border color, as the current code does.\n2. Create a 3x3 output grid.\n3. Only fill the corner pixels of that 3x3 grid with the identified color.\n4. Fill all the non corner pixels with 0.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**\n\nLet's analyze some additional metrics using a combination of observation and the pixel mismatch count.\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code incorrectly filled all pixels. It must only color the corners.\n*   **Example 2:** The code incorrectly filled all pixels. It must only color the corners.\n*   **Example 3:** The code incorrectly filled all pixels. It must only color the corners.\n*   **Example 4:** The code incorrectly filled all pixels. It must only color the corners.\n*   **Example 5:** The code incorrectly filled all pixels. It must only color the corners.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
