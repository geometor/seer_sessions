Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The core transformation seems to involve identifying a specific color (or colors) in the input and expanding it outwards in the output while maintaining a specific shape related to the expanded color's original position.  The color '2' (red) in the input appears to act as a "seed" which is removed and causes the neighboring non-zero color to expand. The output grid seems to always be a 9x9 grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_size:
      train_1: 3x3
      train_2: 3x3
  - output_grid_size:
      train_1: 9x9
      train_2: 9x9
  - input_colors:
      train_1: [0, 2, 3]
      train_2: [0, 2, 3]
  - output_colors:
      train_1: [0, 3]
      train_2: [0, 3]
  - seed_color:
      train_1: 2
      train_2: 2
  - expanding_color:
      train_1: 3
      train_2: 3
  - expansion_shape: rectangle
  - expansion_origin:
    train_1: "The original position of color 3 adjacent to color 2."
    train_2: "The original position of color 3 adjacent to color 2."
  - background_color: 0

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the seed color:**  In both provided examples, the seed color is '2' (red).  It appears in the input, but not the output.
2. **Identify the expanding color:** This is the color adjacent to the seed color in the input. In both examples, this is '3' (green).
3. **Determine the output grid size:** The output is always a 9x9 grid.
4. **Locate the origin of expansion:**  Find the original position of the expanding color (3) that was directly adjacent to the seed color (2) in the input.
5. **Expand the expanding color:**  Create a 4x4 rectangle of the expanding color (3), starting from the origin point determined in the previous step. The seed color is not present in the output.
6. **Fill the background:** Fill the remaining cells of the 9x9 output grid with the background color '0' (white). The expansion creates two 4x4 regions of expanding color.
7.  **Position the two rectangles**: Place the rectangles so that their location within the output grid corresponds to the location of the expanding color in relation to the seed color in the input grid. For example, if the seed color is above, expand the rectangle to a 4x4 square below where the seed color would be located.
