Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of reflecting non-zero pixels across the main diagonal and duplicating them into 2x2 blocks was partially correct. However, the reflection and duplication logic are flawed, leading to incorrect pixel placements and missing some key transformations. The code doesn't handle the "swapping" of color locations correctly, and creates 2x2 blocks when it should be copying based on locations swapped by the diaganol. It's applying the 2x2 logic to the *wrong* location - and it's only operating on the non-zero pixels.

The core issue is that reflection should swap row and column indices, AND the color value should be moved with the swap, and that the colors in the input do not exist in the output. Instead of setting the values in the output grid based on the input color value at `input_grid[r, c]`, the color in the reflected location should be copied. It's swapping color locations, and the 2x2 block creation needs to be based on *this* location - and apply to *all* locations.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Reflection:** Ensure that when a pixel at `(r, c)` is reflected to `(c, r)`, the *color value* at `input_grid[r,c]` is what is copied to create the new 2x2 block.
2. **2x2 block creation for all pixels:** The transformation is applied to all pixels (including those with value '0'), not just the non-zero ones. So instead of a condition `if input_grid[r, c] != 0:`, apply to all.

**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed):**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on identifying objects, properties, actions and errors.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** 6x6 grid. Non-zero pixels: (1,1)=4, (1,2)=6, (2,1)=2, (2,2)=1
*   **Expected Output:** 6x6 grid. Shows a reflection of non-zero values along the main diagonal with 2x2 blocks.
*   **Transformed Output:** Incorrect. The reflection logic places some pixels in wrong position and makes the 2x2 block for wrong positions.
*   **Specific Errors**: The values 4, 6, 2 and 1 should swap locations, creating 2x2 blocks at their new locations.

*   **Transformed Output:** Incorrect placements.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  **Iteration:** Iterate through every pixel of the input grid (all rows and columns).
3.  **Reflection:** For each pixel at location (row `r`, column `c`) in the input grid, swap the row and column indices to get the reflected position (row `c`, column `r`).
4.  **Copy original:** Find the color value of the original pixel from the input grid at (row `r`, column `c`).
5.  **2x2 Block Creation:** Create a 2x2 block in the output grid. The top-left corner of this block is the reflected position (`c`, `r`). Fill all four cells of the 2x2 block with the color value identified from the *original* pixel location. Ensure that you do not write outside the bounds of the output grid.
6. **Output:** Return the modified output grid.
