facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids are 6x6.
  - observation: Non-zero pixels appear to be the focus of the transformation.
  - observation: Zero pixels (black) act as background.
  - observation: objects are potentially reflected across the center of the grids.
  - observation: objects are duplicated on reflection
  - property: input grid, dimensions, 6x6
  - property: output grid, dimensions, 6x6
  - relation: output grid, appears to be transformation of input grid.
  - transformationType: reflection and duplication
  - axisOfReflection: Possibly diagonal from top-left to bottom-right.
