Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of reflecting non-zero pixels across the main diagonal and creating 2x2 blocks. However, the results across multiple examples show this isn't the complete transformation rule. The code fails to accurately reproduce the expected outputs in all three training examples. There's a clear pattern in the errors, suggesting a flaw in the reflection and duplication logic, specifically how the 2x2 blocks are positioned relative to the original and reflected pixels.

**Strategy:**

1. **Examine Misplaced Pixels:** Analyze where the pixels are going wrong. Are they mirrored incorrectly? Are the 2x2 blocks offset?
2. **Re-evaluate Reflection Logic:** The current code swaps row and column indices for reflection, which is a good start, but it seems there's a misunderstanding of how the reflection works.
3. **Revisit 2x2 Block Placement:** The current code creates the duplicate block differently whether above/on or below the diagonal. It seems to be using the reflected index differently.
4. **Correct the core logic, and ensure color preservation.**

**Metrics and Observations (using print statements for clarity, but no actual code execution needed here, will be done in the next step):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has non-zero pixels (4, 6, 2, 1).
    *   Output shows these pixels reflected and duplicated.
    *   Transformed Output has incorrect placement of blocks. The `4` is moved to 0,0 and created as a block. The `6` is treated as if it was at 2,1. The `2` is treated as if it was at 1,2 and `1` is treated as if it was at 2,2
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has non-zero pixels (9, 3, 7, 8).
    *   Output is mirrored and with blocks, but not as in the previous transformed output.
    *   The placement of the 2x2 is incorrect - The `9` is at 2,2 in the input but goes to 1,1. The `3` is at 2,3 and goes to 4,2
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Similar pattern to Example 2. Input has non-zero pixels (3, 6, 5, 2)
    *   Transformed output has incorrect placement, and colors.

**YAML Fact Extraction:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - rows: integer
      - cols: integer
      - cells: integer (0-9, representing colors)

  - name: pixel
    type: grid cell
    properties:
      - row: integer
      - col: integer
      - color: integer (0-9)

  - name: non_zero_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (1-9)

actions:
  - name: reflect
    description: Mirror a pixel across the main diagonal (swap row and column indices).
    input: non_zero_pixel
    output: non_zero_pixel

  - name: duplicate
    description: Create a 2x2 block of pixels with the same color.
    input: non_zero_pixel
    output: 2x2 block of pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Non-zero Pixels:** If a pixel is not zero (i.e., has a color other than white):
3.  **Reflect** Swap the row and column indices of the non-zero pixel to find its reflected position.
4. **Duplicate**: From the reflected position, create a 2x2 block. The reflected position will become the *top-left* cell of the 2x2 block. Fill all four cells of this block with the original pixel's color.
5. If the reflected row, col would be outside the output array, do not perform the duplicate action.
6. **Output:** The output grid consists of these 2x2 blocks of reflected pixels.

The previous code did not consistently place the blocks in the correct reflected position using the reflected position as the top-left cell.
