facts:
  - observation: "The transformation involves reflection and duplication of non-zero pixels."
  - object_property: "Non-zero pixels represent colored objects."
  - reflection_axis: "Reflection occurs across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)."
  - duplication_rule: "Objects are duplicated to form 2x2 blocks"
  - input_objects:
      example_1: 4
      example_2: 4
      example_3: 4
  - output_objects:
      example_1: 8
      example_2: 8
      example_3: 8
  - size: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - colors: "Only colors present in the input grid appear in the output grid."
  - object_count_change: "The number of objects doubles after the complete transformation (considering 2x2 blocks as single objects)"
