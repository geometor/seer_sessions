The core issues seem to revolve around incorrect color propagation and object clearing logic. The code attempts vertical and horizontal propagation but fails to implement the rules correctly as evident in all training examples.\n\nThe strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each example, focusing on the specific conditions that trigger color changes and object clearing. Use code execution to develop metrics to confirm assumptions about colors.\n2.  **Fact Gathering:** Systematically document objects (groups of pixels), their properties (color, position), and the actions (propagation, clearing) in a YAML format.\n3.  **Refined Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed analysis and fact gathering, reconstruct the natural language program to describe the transformations accurately.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis**\n\nTo understand the discrepancies better, let's analyze a key metric: the difference in pixel colors between the expected and actual outputs. I will use code execution to get accurate counts.\n\n"
