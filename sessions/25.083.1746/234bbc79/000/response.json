The most prominent feature seems to be the interaction between '2' (red) pixels and other colored pixels, specifically when the other colored pixels are in the vicinity and perhaps above the red pixels. It appears gray (`5`) pixels are acting as some kind of trigger or pathway, though sometimes are consumed.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Their presence and position (especially relative to red pixels) is critical.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule**:\n    *   Iterate through the grid.\n    *   Focus on groups of vertically adjacent pixels.\n    *   If a group of vertically adjacent pixels contains a gray pixel *above* a red pixel, observe if there are other colored pixels (not 0, 2, or 5) above the gray pixel.\n    *   If the above applies:\n        *   Replace the value of the red pixel with the value of the colored pixel above the triggering gray pixel.\n        *   The colored pixel can also replace adjacent other colored pixels, and the red pixel can replace adjacent gray pixels.\n        *   Remove consumed gray pixels (replace them with black/0)\n\n4. **Output**: Create a new grid, with the rule applied.\n\nKey observations:\n\n* The grey pixels aren't always consumed, but are generally acting as some sort of directional instruction\n\n* Other colored pixels vertically above the red pixels seem to propagate their value downwards, overriding the red.\n\n* There's some kind of conditional replacement occurring, mediated by the position and existence of gray pixels.\n"
