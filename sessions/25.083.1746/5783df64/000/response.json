            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze this ARC-AGI task. Here's my breakdown of the input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** The input is a 2D grid of digits (0-9), representing different colors. Most of the grid is filled with 0 (white), acting as a background. Non-zero digits appear to be sparsely distributed.\n*   **Output:** The output is a smaller 2D grid. It contains only the non-zero digits from the input, arranged in a seemingly specific order. The output grid appears to always be 3x3.\n*   **Transformation:** The core task is to extract and rearrange the non-zero digits. The spatial relationship between the digits in the input doesn't directly translate to the output. It seems that relative positions in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order matter.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Populate the output grid with the ordered list of non-zero digits, filling it row by row (first row, then second row, then third row).\n\nEssentially the algorithm is to read the non-zero numbers from the input in \"reading order\", then write them into the output, also in reading order.\n"
