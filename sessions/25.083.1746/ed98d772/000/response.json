The pattern of expansion seems to replicate the input grid's structure in a mirrored or tiled fashion, specifically in the output, the pixels for each row and column seem to be duplicated, and then, the whole matrix seems to be expanded again, with some form of mirroring. It also seems that background colors (represented by \"0\") do not affect the expansion. It is important to track the positions.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"
