facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid is always twice the size (both width and height) of the input grid.
  - observation: |
      The number of pixels of each non-zero color in the output grid is four times the number of
      pixels of that color in the input grid.
  - observation: |
      The number of zero (background) pixels in the output grid is also four times the number of zero pixels in the input.
  - observation: |
      The transformation effectively replicates each pixel in the input grid into a 2x2 block in the output grid.  The current code's attempt to use neighboring pixels to influence the 2x2 block is incorrect.
