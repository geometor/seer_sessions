facts:
  - description: "Input grid dimensions are doubled in the output grid."
    type: observation
    evidence: "Output grid has twice the number of rows and columns as the input grid."

  - description: "Pixels from the input grid are mapped to specific locations in the output grid based on a combination of their row and column indices."
    type: rule
    evidence: "Pixel mapping analysis reveals a consistent pattern of coordinate transformation using row and column index interleaving."

  - description: "Zero pixels and non zero pixels behave differently"
    type: "differentiation"
    evidence: "the rule to map pixels change if the input is 0"
