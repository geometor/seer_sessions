Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits, representing colors.\n*   The most prominent colors in the input grids are magenta (6), gray (5), and white (0).\n*    The output grids seem to be a condensed version.\n*   The output grids consistently use yellow (4) and white (0).\n*   The output grids are always 4x4, whereas the input grids have varying dimensions.\n*    It appears that areas of magenta (6) are somehow converted into yellow, with some relationship the gray.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
