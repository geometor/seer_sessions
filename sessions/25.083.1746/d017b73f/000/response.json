Split the object into two at the halfway horizontal point.\n3.  **Rearrange:** Shift all blocks of values horizontally.\n4. **Combine**: The top half of the object from step 2 moves to combine with the preceding object, from right to left.\n5. **Adjust Grid:** It is important to eliminate complete rows of zeros from top to bottom.\n\nThis program captures the core transformation: identifying distinct color blocks, and then combine and arrange them based on their spatial relationship and position.\n"
