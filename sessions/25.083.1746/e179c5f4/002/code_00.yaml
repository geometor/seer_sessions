- task: "Create a checkered pattern of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels, based on the location of a single blue pixel in the input."
- objects:
    - object: "Input Grid"
      properties:
        type: "2D Array"
        values: "Integers 0-9"
        size: "Variable, between 1x1 and 30x30"
        contains_blue_pixel: True
    - object: "Output Grid"
      properties:
        type: "2D Array"
        values: "Integers 1 and 8"
        size: "Same as Input Grid"
        pattern: "Checkered"
        pattern_colors: [1, 8]  # Blue and Azure

    - action: "Locate Blue Pixel"
      description: "Find the coordinates of the single blue pixel in the input grid."
    - action: "Generate Checkered Pattern"
      description: "Fill the output grid with a checkered pattern of blue and azure, determining start color by grid location parity."
    - action: "Determine Start Color"
      description: "The parity of the sum of the row and column indices determines the color. If (row + col) % 2 == 0 then the color at [row,col] is azure (8). If (row+col)%2 == 1 then color at [row,col] is blue (1)."
