"""
The transformation rule involves creating a checkered pattern of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels in the output grid, based on the location of a single blue pixel in the input. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. The color of each cell in the output grid is determined by the sum of its row and column indices: if (row + col) % 2 is 0, the color is azure (8); otherwise, it's blue (1).

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a partially correct understanding of the transformation. While it correctly identified the checkered pattern and the use of blue (1) and azure (8), it incorrectly assumed a consistent alternation starting with azure (8) at position (0, 0). The results show discrepancies in the starting color of the checkerboard pattern across different examples. Example 2 is perfectly matched, but 1 and 3 have errors. This points to an issue in how the origin of the checkerboard is determined. The code currently assumes the top-left cell (0,0) is always azure. It's likely dependent on the position of '1' in input grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** Carefully examine the input grids, expected outputs, and transformed outputs of Examples 1 and 3 to understand *why* the checkerboard starts with the "wrong" color. Focus on the relationship between the blue pixel's location in the input and the output's pattern.
2.  **Refine the Rule:** Determine the precise rule that dictates the starting color of the checkerboard pattern. It likely involves the row and/or column of the blue pixel in the input.
3.  **Metric Gathering:** Use code execution to precisely determine the row and column indices of the blue pixel in each input grid. This will help verify any hypothesis about the checkerboard origin rule.
4. **Fact and Natural language program**: use the observations gathered to generate the fact and the natural language program

**Metric Gathering (Code Execution):**



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

# Input grids from the examples
input_grids = [
    np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0]]),
    np.array([[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [1, 0]]),
    np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0]])
]

for i, grid in enumerate(input_grids):
    blue_pixels = np.where(grid == 1)
    if len(blue_pixels[0]) > 0:
        blue_row, blue_col = blue_pixels[0][0], blue_pixels[1][0]
        print(f"Example {i+1}: Blue pixel at row={blue_row}, col={blue_col}")
    else:
        print(f"Example {i+1}: No blue pixel found")


```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: 1
```
Example 1: Blue pixel at row=9, col=0
Example 2: Blue pixel at row=9, col=0
Example 3: Blue pixel at row=9, col=0

```
**Fact YAML:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Contains a single blue pixel (value 1) and other pixels with value 0.
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: A checkered pattern of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels, with dimensions identical to the input grid.
    properties:
       - checkered_pattern: True
       - colors: [1, 8]

  - name: blue_pixel
    type: pixel
    value: 1
    properties:
        - input_row_index: int  # Row index in the input grid
        - input_col_index: int # Column index in the input grid

actions:
  - name: determine_checkerboard_origin
    description: The starting color (blue or azure) of the checkerboard pattern depends on the sum of row and column of the blue pixel in input array and the sum of the output cell coordinates.
    inputs:
        - blue_pixel_row: int
        - blue_pixel_col: int
        - cell_row_index: int #output grid cell's row
        - cell_col_index: int #output grid cell's col
    logic:  If (blue_pixel_row + blue_pixel_col + cell_row_index + cell_col_index) is even, the cell color is azure (8). Otherwise, it's blue (1).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate the Blue Pixel:** Find the row and column indices (r\_blue, c\_blue) of the single blue pixel (value 1) within the input grid.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  **Populate Output Grid (Checkered Pattern):** Iterate through each cell of the output grid, using its row index (r) and column index (c).
4.  **Determine Cell Color:** For each output cell at (r, c), calculate the sum: `r_blue + c_blue + r + c`.
    *   If the sum is even, set the output cell's value to 8 (azure).
    *   If the sum is odd, set the output cell's value to 1 (blue).
5. return the output grid

Essentially, the program constructs a checkerboard pattern where the parity (evenness or oddness) of the sum of the blue pixel's coordinates and the current cell's coordinates determines the cell's color.
