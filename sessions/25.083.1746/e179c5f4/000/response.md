Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to understand the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A rectangular grid of pixels, predominantly black (0), with a single blue (1) pixel in the bottom left corner.
*   **Output:** A rectangular grid of the same dimensions as the input. The blue pixel from the input is retained, and an alternating pattern of azure (8) and the blue (1) pixel fills the grid, its arrangement influenced by the blue pixel's initial position.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to be a form of "filling" the grid based on the location of the initial blue pixel. The filling uses an alternating pattern.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - color: predominantly black (0)
      - feature: single blue (1) pixel
      - shape: rectangle
      - dimensions: variable
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - color: azure (8) and blue (1)
      - pattern: alternating
      - shape: rectangle
      - dimensions: same as input_grid
actions:
  - name: fill
    description: Populate the grid with an alternating pattern of azure and blue, anchored by the initial blue pixel.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid's pattern is determined by the location of the blue pixel in the input grid.
  - type: dimensional
    description: input and output grids are the same dimensions
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate the single blue (1) pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve:** Maintain the blue pixel in the same location on output grid
3.  **Fill Diagonally:**
    *   Starting one column to the left, and, one row above the blue pixel,
        fill the new cell with azure
    *   Diagonally alternating blue and azure pixels above the blue pixel,
        moving left and up.
    *   Diagonally alternating azure and blue pixels below the blue pixel,
        moving right and down.
4.  **Fill Grid:**
    *    Using the diagonal fill as a guide, create a checkered
         pattern using the two colors (azure and blue)

Another take at expressing steps 3 & 4

1. **Create checkered pattern**
    * traverse the entire grid, setting each location to blue or azure
    * start the bottom-left pixel as blue, and alternate colors, such that the
      pixel to the left and below are of opposite colors
