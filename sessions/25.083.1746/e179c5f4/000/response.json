The blue pixel from the input is retained, and an alternating pattern of azure (8) and the blue (1) pixel fills the grid, its arrangement influenced by the blue pixel's initial position.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to be a form of \"filling\" the grid based on the location of the initial blue pixel. The filling uses an alternating pattern.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
