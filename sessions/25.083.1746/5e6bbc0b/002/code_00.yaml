objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable
      cols: variable
      cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - name: diagonal_tl_br
    type: object set
    properties:
       direction: top-left to bottom-right
       elements: list of cell values
       rule: |
        If it begins with 1, all pixels are converted to white (0).
        If it starts with 0, it stays all 0s

  - name: diagonal_tr_bl
    type: object set
    properties:
      direction: top-right to bottom-left
      elements: list of cell values
      rule: All pixels are converted to blue (1).

    type: object
    properties:
       value: 8
       location: (row, col)
       transformation_target:
        relation: varies #Could be up and left/down and left/to the right
        new_value: 9

actions:
  - name: transform_diagonal_tl_br
    input: diagonal_tl_br
    rule: described above
  - name: transform_diagonal_tr_bl
    input: diagonal_tr_bl
    rule: described above
  - name: transform_based_on_azure
    input: azure_pixel
    rule: Change pixel at transformation_target to 9. Location is context dependent
  - name: copy_other_pixels
    input: grid cell
    rule: if not on a transforming diagonal and does not have azure rule, copy input value to output
