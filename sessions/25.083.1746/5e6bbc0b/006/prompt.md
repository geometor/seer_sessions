"""
Transforms an input grid based on diagonal patterns and the presence of azure (8) pixels.

1.  **Top-Left to Bottom-Right Diagonals:**
    *   Iterate through all possible diagonals starting from the top-left to the bottom-right.
    *   If a diagonal starts with a blue (1) pixel, change all pixels on that diagonal to white (0).
    *   If a diagonal starts with a white (0) pixel, keep all of the 0 pixels as 0.

2.  **Top-Right to Bottom-Left Diagonals:**
    *   Iterate through all possible diagonals starting from the top-right to the bottom-left.
    *   Change all pixels on these diagonals to blue (1).

3.  **Azure Pixel (8) Transformation:**
    *   Locate all azure (8) pixels in the grid.
    *   For each azure pixel, identify a target pixel based on these rules (only one applies per example, check in listed order):
        1.  If there are any pixels to the *left* of the azure pixel, change them to maroon (9). (Example 1)
        2.  If there are any pixels to the *right* of the azure pixel, change them to maroon (9). (Example 2)
        3. If there is a pixel *diagonally up and to the left* of the azure pixel, change this pixel to maroon (9). (Example 3)
        4. If there is a pixel *diagonally down and to the left* of the azure pixel, change this pixel to maroon (9). (Example 4)

4.  **Copy Other Pixels**: Pixels that are not affected by the diagonal transformations or the azure transformation, must remain unchanged.
