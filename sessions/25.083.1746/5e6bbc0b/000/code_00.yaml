facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Color 0 (white) is generally dominant, acting as a background.
  - observation: Colors 1 (blue) and 0 (white) often form alternating patterns, especially diagonals.
  - observation: Color 8 (azure) appears infrequently, but might play a crucial role in defining the transformation.
  - observation: There seems to be some inverting of the colors. For example, 1 changes to a 0 and sometimes, 0 changes to a 1.
  - observation: The transformation appears in train_3 to perform some action with the 9 (maroon color). It seems to be "placed" in the output.
  - relationship: "Diagonals of alternating 0s and 1s are important to the transformation"
  - action: Colors are "flipped", where color_in changes into color_out.
  - action: "There is an interaction between the different colors, specifically colors 0, 1, 8 and 9"
