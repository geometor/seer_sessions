The transformation isn't a simple one-to-one mapping of colors, as the same input color can result in different output colors depending on its context. The key seems to lie in identifying diagonal patterns and potentially \"inverting\" or swapping colors based on these diagonals. The presence of color 8 (azure) seems significant, potentially acting as a marker or pivot. The surrounding context is the key.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

For example, 1 changes to a 0 and sometimes, 0 changes to a 1.\n  - observation: The transformation appears in train_3 to perform some action with the 9 (maroon color). It seems to be \"placed\" in the output.\n  - relationship: \"Diagonals of alternating 0s and 1s are important to the transformation\"\n  - action: Colors are \"flipped\", where color_in changes into color_out.\n  - action: \"There is an interaction between the different colors, specifically colors 0, 1, 8 and 9\"\n```"
