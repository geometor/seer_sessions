If there are any pixels to the *left* of the azure pixel, change them to maroon (9). (Example 1)\n        2.  If there are any pixels to the *right* of the azure pixel, change them to maroon (9). (Example 2)\n        3. If there is a pixel *diagonally up and to the left* of the azure pixel, change this pixel to maroon (9). (Example 3)\n        4. If there is a pixel *diagonally down and to the left* of the azure pixel, change this pixel to maroon (9). (Example 4)\n\n4.  **Copy Other Pixels**: Pixels that are not affected by the diagonal transformations or the azure transformation, must remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Helper function to get a specific diagonal\n    def get_diagonal(start_row, start_col, direction):\n        diagonal = []\n        r, c = start_row, start_col\n        while 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols:\n            diagonal.append((r, c, input_grid[r, c]))\n            if direction == \"tl_br\":  # Top-left to bottom-right\n                r += 1\n                c += 1\n            else:  # tr_bl: Top-right to bottom-left\n                r += 1\n                c -= 1\n        return diagonal\n\n    # Transform top-left to bottom-right diagonals\n    for r in range(rows):\n        diagonal = get_diagonal(r, 0, \"tl_br\")\n        if diagonal and diagonal[0][2] == 1:  # Check first pixel of diagonal\n            for row, col, _ in diagonal:\n                output_grid[row, col] = 0\n        elif diagonal and diagonal[0][2] == 0:\n            for row, col, val in diagonal:\n                if val == 0:\n                    output_grid[row,col] = 0\n\n    for c in range(1, cols):\n        diagonal = get_diagonal(0, c, \"tl_br\")\n        if diagonal and diagonal[0][2] == 1:\n             for row, col, _ in diagonal:\n                output_grid[row, col] = 0\n        elif diagonal and diagonal[0][2] == 0:\n            for row, col, val in diagonal:\n                if val == 0:\n                    output_grid[row,col] = 0\n\n    # Transform top-right to bottom-left diagonals\n    for r in range(rows):\n        diagonal = get_diagonal(r, cols - 1, \"tr_bl\")\n        for row, col, _ in diagonal:\n            output_grid[row, col] = 1\n    for c in range(cols - 1):\n        diagonal = get_diagonal(0, c, \"tr_bl\")\n        for row, col, _ in diagonal:\n            output_grid[row, col] = 1\n\n    # Apply Azure Transformation - Relative Positioning\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 8:\n                # Check for pixels to the left\n                if c > 0:\n                    output_grid[r, :c] = 9\n                    continue  # Apply only one rule per azure pixel\n\n                # Check for pixels to the right\n                if c < cols - 1:\n                    output_grid[r, c+1:] = 9\n                    continue # Apply only one rule\n\n                # Check diagonally up-left\n                if r > 0 and c > 0:\n                    output_grid[r - 1, c - 1] = 9\n                    continue  # Apply only one rule\n\n                # Check diagonally down-left\n                if r < rows - 1 and c > 0:\n                    output_grid[r + 1, c - 1] = 9\n                    continue  # Apply only one rule\n\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
