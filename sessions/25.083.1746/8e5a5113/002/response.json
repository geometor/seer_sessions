            "text": "Here's an analysis of the results and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of mirroring around a central \"white\" column and transferring the leftmost/rightmost columns was partially correct but fundamentally flawed. The code misinterprets the mirroring process and incorrectly handles the transfer of colors. The consistent failure across all examples, with many pixels off and incorrect color palettes, indicates a significant misunderstanding of the core transformation. The central column of zeros is an important anchor, but the mirroring and transferring is incorrectly performed. The primary issue lies in assuming a simple reflection and incorrect color transferring.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Mirroring:** The current mirroring logic is incorrect. Instead of a direct reflection across the central white column, the transformation appears to involve taking the _colors_ from the left side of the white column and using them in a _mirrored order_ *but* assigning those colors in the correct mirrored locations on the right side.\n\n2.  **Re-evaluate Color Transfer:** The current logic overwrites parts of the grid intended for mirroring. We must modify the function to consider color transfers *before* the main reflection.\n\n3.  **Object Identification:** Focus on identifying \"objects\" not just as contiguous blocks of the same color but as distinct color *patterns* on either side of the central white column. The transformation replicates these patterns in a specific way.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection, not code execution for this specific response, because image visualization is not available, and I am working from the provided text outputs):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has a central white column at index 4, 5, and 6.\n    *   Left side pattern: `6 3 3 5`, `6 3 3 5`, `6 3 2 5`\n    *   Right side pattern (expected): Mirrored colors but not a simple reflection of locations `6 6 6 5` and `2 3 6`, `3 3 3 5` and `3 3 6`, `3 3 3 5` and `3 3 6`\n    *   The right side appears to copy the values from left side into the positions mirrored on the right side across the axis on the left side of the central zeros.\n    *\tThe leftmost column is copied to the column to the right of the central zeros.\n    *\tThe rightmost column is copied to the leftmost column.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has a central white column at index 4, 5, and 6.\n    *   Left side pattern: `1 1 2 5`, `4 1 1 5`, `4 4 1 5`\n    *   Right side pattern (expected): Similar mirroring logic as Example 1.\n    *\tThe leftmost column is copied to the column to the right of the central zeros.\n    *\tThe rightmost column is copied to the leftmost column.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input has a central white column at index 4, 5, and 6.\n    *   Left side pattern: `2 7 8 5`, `7 7 8 5`, `8 8 8 5`\n    *   Right side pattern (expected): Similar mirroring logic as Example 1.\n    *\tThe leftmost column is copied to the column to the right of the central zeros.\n    *\tThe rightmost column is copied to the leftmost column.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
