Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors). The input grids consistently have a section of `0` (white) values in the center, bordered by non-zero values. The output grids appear to "fill in" the `0` values with a mirrored pattern of the surrounding non-zero values, and also alter some existing non zero values. The overall shape and size of the grid remain constant. The transformation seems to involve a reflection or mirroring operation centered around the central column of zeros, but also a complex "transfer" of values.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the central "white" (0-valued) columns:** Find the contiguous vertical columns of `0`s that divide the input grid.
2.  **Mirror/Reflect Left to Right:** starting at the white columns, working rightwards, set values to be the mirror image of the left half of the grid across the axis defined by the start of the central column of 0s.
3. **Transfer leftmost column:** Starting at the central white column, working inwards to the left, set cells to be equal to the rightmost column. Stop when reaching the border or a white cell.
4. **Transfer rightmost column:** Starting at the first column, working inwards to the right, set cells to be equal to the rightmost column. Stop when reaching the border or a white cell.
