facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of integers.
    properties:
      - width: constant between input and output
      - height: constant between input and output
      - values: single-digit integers (0-9)

  - type: object
    description: Contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels.
    properties:
      - color: integer value (1-9)
      - shape: irregular

  - type: object
    description: Central column of zero-valued pixels.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - shape: vertical line
      - role: axis of reflection/transformation

  - type: transformation
    description: Values from the left side of the central zeros are mirrored/transferred to the right.
        properties:
          - type: reflection and transfer
          - axis: central column of zeros
          - scope: local (affects immediate neighbors of zeros)
          -complex_transfers: leftmost and rightmost columns are transfered inwards

  - type: transformation
    description: complex transfer of values
