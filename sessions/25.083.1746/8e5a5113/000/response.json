The input grids consistently have a section of `0` (white) values in the center, bordered by non-zero values. The output grids appear to \"fill in\" the `0` values with a mirrored pattern of the surrounding non-zero values, and also alter some existing non zero values. The overall shape and size of the grid remain constant. The transformation seems to involve a reflection or mirroring operation centered around the central column of zeros, but also a complex \"transfer\" of values.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
