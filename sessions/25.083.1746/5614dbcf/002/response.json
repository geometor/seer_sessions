However, the test results reveal inconsistencies. Specifically, Example 1 highlights an issue where the color '5' appears in incorrect locations. Example 2 exhibits a similar, but less severe error. The core problem is not ignoring 'white' pixels correctly. The implemented code attempts to reduce each 3x3 block, but the placement of the center values seems too rigid when the input values contain other colors.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Clearly define what constitutes an \"object\" within each 3x3 block, it seems like the center pixel is the main object.\n2.  **Improve Action Description:** The natural language program must accurately explain how each 3x3 block collapses.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's use the results from the prompt, no code execution is needed.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x9\n    *   Output Size: 3x3\n    *   Pixels Off: 2\n    *   Main discrepancy: The '5' values show that the rule only about selecting centers is incorrect.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x9\n    *   Output Size: 3x3\n    *   Pixels Off: 1\n    *   Main Discrepancy: center selection is correct other than one `5` value.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
