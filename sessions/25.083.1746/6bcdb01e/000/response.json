Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** Both input and output are rectangular grids of varying dimensions.\n*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of different colors, represented by single-digit integers (0-9). The colors observed are primarily orange (7), azure (8), and green (3).\n*   **Shapes:** There isn't a clear definition of complex shapes formed by groups of same colored pixels. Irregular regions of single color.\n*\t**Change:** The transformation seems centered around the replacement of certain color regions\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
