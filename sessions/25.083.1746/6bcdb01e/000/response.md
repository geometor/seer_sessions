Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the underlying transformation logic. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** Both input and output are rectangular grids of varying dimensions.
*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of different colors, represented by single-digit integers (0-9). The colors observed are primarily orange (7), azure (8), and green (3).
*   **Shapes:** There isn't a clear definition of complex shapes formed by groups of same colored pixels. Irregular regions of single color.
*	**Change:** The transformation seems centered around the replacement of certain color regions

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    properties:
      source_color: integer
      target_color: integer
      location: rule-based (see natural language program)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid, adjacency matters.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all instances of color '7' (orange) that have immediate horizontally or vertically, adjacent color '3' (Green).
2.  **Conditional Replacement:** Replace the identified '7' (Orange) pixels with color 3 (Green).
3.  All other pixels should not change.

In essence, the transformation replaces orange (7) pixels with green (3) pixels, but only for those original orange pixels that are directly beside a green pixel.
