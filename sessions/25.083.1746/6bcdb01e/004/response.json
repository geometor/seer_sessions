While it correctly identified the interaction between orange (7) and green (3) pixels, it failed to capture the *propagation* of the green color. The transformation isn't just about immediate neighbors; it seems that green \"overwrites\" orange in a connected region. The code only checks direct neighbors and only changes orange to green if a *direct* neighbor is green. It needs to account for how green spreads through connected orange regions.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Examples Closely:** Carefully examine *both* example transformations to identify the exact rule governing how green replaces orange. Pay close attention to the *extent* of the green spread.\n2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the description to accurately capture the observed \"spreading\" behavior of the green color.  The concept of \"connected components\" or \"region filling\" should be considered.\n3.  **Metrics Gathering:** I don't need to do more metrics gathering - the information provided is very good and complete.\n4.  **Revise Facts (YAML):** Update the YAML block with new insights. This includes concepts like \"connected regions\" and \"color propagation.\"\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
