1.  **Initialization:** Start with a copy of the input grid as the output grid.
2.  **Identify Green Seeds:** Locate all green (3) pixels in the *input* grid. These act as "seeds" for the propagation.
3.  **Propagate Green:** For *each* green seed:
    *   Find all orange (7) pixels that are part of the same connected region (horizontally, vertically, *or diagonally*) as the green seed.
    *   Change all those orange pixels to green (3) in the *output* grid.
4. **Copy Unchanged Pixels:** Copy to output grid all pixels that aren't orange in a connected region with a green pixel.
5.  **Return:** The modified output grid.
