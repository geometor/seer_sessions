1.  **Initialization:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  **Identify Seeds:** Locate all green (3) pixels in the input grid. These are the "seeds".
3.  **Propagation:** For *each* green seed pixel:
    *   Perform a breadth-first search (or depth-first search) starting from the green seed.
    *  Add the seed location to visited.
    *   Expand outwards, checking all 8 neighboring pixels (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
    *   If a neighboring pixel is orange (7), add its coordinates to a set of `connected_orange` pixels, and change the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to green (3).
    *   Continue expanding from any found orange pixels.
4.  **Return:** The modified output grid.
