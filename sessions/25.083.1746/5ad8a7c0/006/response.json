            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code's logic is partially correct. It identifies connected components of red pixels and attempts to expand horizontal and vertical lines. However, it doesn't correctly handle all cases, particularly when horizontal and vertical lines intersect or are adjacent. The code also fails to handle non-contiguous red lines, single-pixel length red shapes, and sometimes over-expands. The core issue is that the expansion logic is too simplistic: it expands *any* horizontal or vertical line it finds, without checking if it's part of a larger structure or if the expansion will conflict with other expanded pixels.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Improve Component Classification:** The `classify_component` function needs to be more nuanced. It should not only distinguish between horizontal and vertical lines but also consider their lengths and their relationship to other red pixels. Specifically, it needs to handle non-contiguous cases.\n\n2. **Refine Expansion Logic:** Instead of blindly expanding all horizontal and vertical lines, the expansion should be conditional. We should look for contiguous lines of red pixels and expand isolated segments separately, also check if contiguous red pixels are present, and treat them as special cases.\n\n3. **Consider Single-Pixel Components:** The current logic seems to ignore single-pixel red components which is wrong.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed):**\n\nLet's look at a structured breakdown. Note that I cannot execute code here. I am explaining my intended code and resulting assumptions.\n\n"
