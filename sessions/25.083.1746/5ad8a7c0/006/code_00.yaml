Example1:
  InputShape: (4, 6)
  OutputShape: (4, 6)
  InputRedPixelCount: 4
  OutputRedPixelCount: 8
  Transformation: Two separate horizontal lines of red pixels, each of length 2, are identified. The program intends to extend them to full-row length but fails.
  Issues: The extension only works for the initial pixels

Example2:
  InputShape: (4, 6)
  OutputShape: (4, 6)
  InputRedPixelCount: 8
  OutputRedPixelCount: 8
  Transformation:  A 2x2 square and two vertical lines of red pixels. The central 2x2 square should stay the same, but the lines should not expand as they intersect.
  Issues: The lines should not expand when it intersects the center piece

Example3:
  InputShape: (4, 6)
  OutputShape: (4, 6)
  InputRedPixelCount: 8
  OutputRedPixelCount: 8
  Transformation: Two vertical lines and two horizontal lines. Horizontal and vertical lines form two disconnected '+' shapes.
  Issues:  '+' shape is not handled correctly.

Example4:
  InputShape: (4, 6)
  OutputShape: (4, 6)
  InputRedPixelCount: 8
  OutputRedPixelCount: 8
  Transformation:  A 2x2 square in the top, and four pixels forming a disconnected square shape.
  Issues: No change is required.

Example5:
  InputShape: (4, 6)
  OutputShape: (4, 6)
  InputRedPixelCount: 8
  OutputRedPixelCount: 8
  Transformation:  Two vertical lines and two horizontal segments of length one. The single-pixel segments should stay single pixels, and only the two-pixel-length lines should expand.
  Issues: incorrectly extended the non-contiguous single red pixels.
