The transformation rule identifies continuous, straight, un-branching lines of red pixels (value 2) within the input grid. These can be either horizontal or vertical. If such a line exists, *and it's the only such line*, it is expanded to fill the entire row (if horizontal) or the entire column (if vertical) it occupies. If there are isolated red pixels, or more than one line of red pixels, or any L shapes, no change occurs.
