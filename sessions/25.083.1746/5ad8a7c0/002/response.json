            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of expanding *connected* red lines to the edges. However, the results show that this concept is not entirely correct. Some examples (2 and 4) match perfectly, suggesting the initial idea captures *part* of the rule. Other examples (1, 3, and 5) show partial or no expansion, indicating the conditions for expansion are not fully understood. The core issue appears to be an oversimplification of the \"connected line\" concept. It's not just about *any* connected red pixels; the position and arrangement matter more than initially thought.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Matching Examples:** Examine examples 2 and 4 closely to identify the *precise* conditions under which the transformation works as initially coded.\n2.  **Analyze Mismatching Examples:** Examine examples 1, 3, and 5 to understand *why* the transformation failed. What distinguishes these cases from the successful ones?\n3.  **Refine the Rule:** Based on the analysis, adjust the natural language program to accurately capture the *necessary and sufficient* conditions for the red pixel expansion. It seems likely we need to consider the *relationship* of red pixels to each other, rather than just whether the red pixels extend to the borders.\n4. **Consider Edge Cases:** Look for patterns. Is it only about horizontal/vertical lines? Is the length of the line important?\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI'll use the provided results directly, as they already offer the key information. I won't use `tool_code` for this step, as the `Pixels Off` is a sufficient metric.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Pixels Off: 8. Match: False.\n*   **Example 2:** Pixels Off: 0. Match: True.\n*   **Example 3:** Pixels Off: 4. Match: False.\n*   **Example 4:** Pixels Off: 0. Match: True.\n*   **Example 5:** Pixels Off: 4. Match: False.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
