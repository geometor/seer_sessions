The transformation rule identifies continuous, straight, un-branching lines of red pixels (value 2) within the input grid. These can be either horizontal or vertical. If such a line exists, *and it's the only such line*, it is expanded to fill the entire row (if horizontal) or the entire column (if vertical) it occupies. If there are isolated red pixels, or more than one line of red pixels, or any L shapes, no change occurs.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program was too restrictive. It only expanded red lines if there was *exactly one* in the entire grid. The examples show a more complex rule is at play. It seems that the expansion of red lines happens selectively even when multiple lines are present, especially when lines intersect. It looks for *connected* red lines forming simple shapes.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Intersections:** The core issue seems to be how the program handles multiple red lines, particularly where they might intersect. We need to check for connected components more intelligently, distinguishing between separate lines and those forming "T" or "+" shapes.
2.  **Refine Line Detection:** Instead of simply counting lines, we need to detect connected components of red pixels. A connected component can be a single horizontal or vertical line, but also a combination of those (like a 'T' or '+').
3.  **Conditional Expansion:** Based on the *shape* of the connected component, decide whether to extend. Simple horizontal or vertical lines are candidates for extension, L shapes, T and + shapes shouldn't be extended.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: RedLines
    description: Connected components of red pixels (value 2).
    properties:
      - type: Horizontal, Vertical, L-Shaped, T-Shaped, or Plus-Shaped
      - connected: True/False (whether pixels are adjacent)
      - expandable: True/False (whether the line should be expanded)

actions:
  - name: Expand
    description: Extend a red line to fill its row or column.
    preconditions:
      - The RedLine is of type Horizontal or Vertical.
      - red line consists of more than one pixel
    postconditions:
      - All pixels in the row (if Horizontal) or column (if Vertical) of the RedLine are set to red (value 2).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Lines:** Find all connected components of red pixels (value 2) in the input grid. A connected component is a group of red pixels where each pixel is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to at least one other red pixel in the group.

2.  **Classify Red Lines:** Categorize each red line based on its shape:
    *   **Horizontal:** All pixels share the same row.
    *   **Vertical:** All pixels share the same column.
    *   **L-Shaped:** The red line can be decomposed into a horizontal and vertical segment which intersect at only one pixel.
    * **T-Shaped:** The red line is made up of exactly two segments. One horizontal segment intersects one vertical segment, and the intersection is *not* at the ends of either segment.
    * **+-Shaped:** The red line consists of one vertical line and one horizontal line that intersect.

3.  **Expand Simple Lines:** If a connected component is classified as *either* a Horizontal *or* a Vertical red line *and consists of more than one pixel*, expand it.
    *   **Horizontal Expansion:** Set all pixels in the row of the horizontal line to red (value 2).
    *   **Vertical Expansion:** Set all pixels in the column of the vertical line to red (value 2).

4.  **No Expansion for Complex Shapes:** If a RedLine is not a simple Horizontal or Vertical line, or if it contains only one pixel do not expand it.

5. **Output:** The output grid is the result of applying these expansion rules to the input grid.
