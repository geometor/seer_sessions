objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: grid
      description: The original 2D array of color values.
      properties:
        rows: number of rows in the input grid
        cols: number of columns in the input grid
        cells: color values (integers 0-9)
  - output_grid:
      type: grid
      description: The transformed 2D array of color values.
      properties:
        rows: number of rows in the output grid (3 times input rows)
        cols: number of columns in the output grid (3 times input cols)
        cells: color values (integers 0-9), replicated from input
  - pixels:
      type: cell
      description: individual cells of the grid, represent colors
      properties:
         value: integer between 0 and 9

actions:
  - replicate:
      description: Each pixel in the input grid is replicated to create a 3x3 block in the output grid.
      input: input_grid.cells
      output: output_grid.cells
relationships:
  - scaling:
      description: The output grid is a scaled-up version of the input grid.
      factor: 3 (both rows and columns)
  - position_preservation:
      description: The relative position of colored regions is maintained between the input and output grids.
