Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Blue Shapes:** Locate all disconnected shapes formed by blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Bounding Rectangle:** Find the smallest rectangular region within the grid that completely encloses all identified blue shapes. This rectangle's boundaries are defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all blue pixels.
3.  **Replace with Green:** In the output grid, keep all the original blue cells from input. Replace all white (0) pixels *within* the bounding rectangle (identified in step 2) with green (3) pixels. Leave all other pixels (those outside the bounding rectangle) unchanged from the input grid. This means white pixels outside the rectangle, stay white.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
