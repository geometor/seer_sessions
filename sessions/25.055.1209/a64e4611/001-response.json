The input grid contains pixels of two colors: azure (8) and white (0). The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid, with some areas of azure (8) replaced by green (3). The overall shape seems to be preserved with a green block filling in the areas that used to be azure.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

It should use the bounds of the azure region as boundaries. It must include some azure pixels at a distance no more than 1 pixel in every row or every column of the grid.\n3.
