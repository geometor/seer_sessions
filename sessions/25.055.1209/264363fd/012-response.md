"""
The transformation rule prioritizes color propagation based on adjacency. If a pixel of color 2 (red) is adjacent to a pixel of color 3 (green), the color 2 pixel becomes color 3. If a pixel of color 4 (yellow) is adjacent to a pixel of color 3 (green), the color 4 pixel becomes color 3.  If a pixel of color 4 (yellow) is adjacent to a pixel of color 2 (red), the color 4 pixel becomes color 2. The key error in the previous code was checking the *input* grid for adjacency when updating the color, instead of using the current state of the *output* grid, which leads to incorrect propagation when multiple adjacent cells could potentially change a cell's color.
