Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved creating diagonal stripes within red rectangles based on color adjacency (prioritizing green, then red). However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this rule isn't universally applicable. The core issue is that the initial program was too specific, focusing on "red rectangles" and a specific striping pattern. We need to generalize the rule to account for other shapes and color interactions. The provided code does an ok job of generalizing since it doesn't find rectangles, it finds adjacencies, but there is an error in the propagation.

The strategy will be:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair and the result of the `transform` function.
2.  **Identify Errors:** Determine where the `transform` function's output deviates from the expected output.
3.  **Generalize the Rule:**  Instead of focusing on specific shapes (rectangles), focus on the *relationships* between adjacent colors and how those relationships dictate the output color.
4.  **Prioritize Adjacency, not shape:** we were close with prioritizing adjacency, but we must fix the error in the propagation
5. **Refine the Natural Language program:** Form a rule based on how color adjacency dictates what color a cell will end up, and clearly describe that.
6.  **YAML facts:** Update to reflect general objects and actions

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To help derive a better understanding of object interactions, I will call a function `analyze_results` to return a dictionary of results from applying the transformation and comparing to expected output:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
