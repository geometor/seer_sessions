Here's my analysis:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Background:** The majority of both grids is filled with '8' (azure).\n*   **Objects:** There are distinct regions of '1' (blue) within the azure background.\n*   **Highlighting:** Some of the blue '1' pixels are replaced by other colors ('2' - red, '3' - green). This seems to highlight or select specific blue pixels based on a pattern. The azure is unaffected.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"
