The dominant color is blue (1), with two large red (2) rectangles. Within the rectangles, there are green (3) lines, and where the lines intersect, the color is yellow (4). It appears the transformation involves shifting colors within specific regions, creating diagonal striping where color 3 and 2, 3 and 4, 4 and 2, are adjacent.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
