Okay, I've reviewed the example input and output grids. Here's my analysis:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Background:** The majority of both grids is filled with '8' (azure).
*   **Objects:** There are distinct regions of '1' (blue) within the azure background.
*   **Highlighting:** Some of the blue '1' pixels are replaced by other colors ('2' - red, '3' - green). This seems to highlight or select specific blue pixels based on a pattern. The azure is unaffected.

**YAML Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: background
    color: azure (8)
    description: The canvas on which other objects exist.
  - object: blue_regions
    color: blue (1)
    description: Rectangular areas within the background.
  - object: selected_pixels
    colors:
      - red (2)
      - green (3)
    description: >
      Specific pixels within the blue regions that are
      changed, possibly based on their position or relationship
      to other pixels.
  - action: highlight
    description: Changing the color of specific blue pixels.
  - relationship: containment
    description: Blue regions are contained within the background.
  - relationship: selection
    description: >
      Red and green pixels are a selection or highlighting of
      specific blue pixels.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels within the azure (8) background.

2.  **Inner Border Highlighting** Locate the blue pixels along the outer edge of each shape.

3. **Create an inner border.** For each identified blue object, change the color of the edge pixel to the next inner edge.

4.  **Highlight Corners:**
    *   If a blue region has a "corner", the azure pixels surrounding that corner in the original input and output, make that corner inside the blue regions green.
    *   Otherwise, highlight pixels as red to create a solid color block to show this inner border.
    *    If two blue regions are on top of another, they have distinct inner borders.

In essence, the transformation identifies blue regions and highlights specific parts with an inner border with red (2), and green (3) at the corners.
