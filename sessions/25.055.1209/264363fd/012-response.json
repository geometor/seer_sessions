If a pixel of color 2 (red) is adjacent to a pixel of color 3 (green), the color 2 pixel becomes color 3. If a pixel of color 4 (yellow) is adjacent to a pixel of color 3 (green), the color 4 pixel becomes color 3.  If a pixel of color 4 (yellow) is adjacent to a pixel of color 2 (red), the color 4 pixel becomes color 2.
