Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all regions of color '9' (maroon). These regions can be single pixels or connected groups of pixels forming various shapes.
2.  **Remove** the '9' (maroon) regions.
3.  **Replace** each removed '9' region with a new color. The replacement color is determined by the context of the removed region, which may includes all colors in the input grid. The context considers surrounding colors, the shape of the removed '9' region, bordering colors of the region, and possibly patterns that extend beyond the immediate neighboring pixels. The goal of replacement is to create cohesive shapes/areas.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, focusing on identifying and replacing regions of color '9' (maroon). The code correctly implements the region finding and replacement logic. However, the initial strategy of replacing with the most common border color is too simplistic and doesn't capture the full complexity of the transformations in all examples. Some examples require a more nuanced understanding of the surrounding context.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, paying close attention to the cases where the current code fails.
2.  **Contextual Understanding:**  The replacement color is not *always* the most common border color. It appears to follow rules that we need to understand fully.
3.  **Refine Replacement Logic:** Update the natural language program to describe the *exact* circumstances that determine the replacement color.
4.  **Iterative Improvement:**  Test the updated logic and code, iterating until all training examples are handled correctly.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To better understand the transformations, I will use the code to get more information about what is going on in each grid and use that to understand why the rule works in some cases and not others.

*Example 1*
- Input shape (3, 5)

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input_shape: (3, 5)
      has_maroon: True
      correct: True
      description: "Single maroon pixels replaced with surrounding color."
  - example_2:
      input_shape: (3, 5)
      has_maroon: True
      correct: True
      description: "Single maroon pixels replaced with surrounding color."
  - example_3:
      input_shape: (9, 9)
      has_maroon: True
      correct: True
      description: "Maroon region correctly replaced based on majority border."
  - example_4:
      input_shape: (5, 13)
      has_maroon: True
      correct: False
      description: "Maroon pixels incorrectly replaced by 0 instead of 1. Horizontal series relationship of 9s."
  - example_5:
      input_shape: (5, 13)
      has_maroon: True
      correct: False
      description: "Maroon pixels incorrectly replaced by 0 instead of 1. Horizontal series relationship of 9s within a row/col"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of color '9' (maroon) in the input grid.
2.  **Contextual Replacement:** For each maroon region:
    *   If the maroon region is part of a horizontal or vertical series of 9s, replace the maroon pixels with color '1' (blue).
    *   Otherwise, replace each maroon pixel in the identified region with the most frequent color that borders the *entire* region. If there is no border, replace it with '0' (white/blank).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
