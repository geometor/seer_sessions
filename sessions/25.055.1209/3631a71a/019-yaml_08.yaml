observations:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels.
  - type: colors
    description: Pixels are colored, represented by digits 0-9.
  - type: objects
    description: Irregular shaped colored blobs exist in the input.
  - type: transformation
    description: Some colored regions are altered; some smaller details seem removed or changed to neighbor colors.
  - type: potential_operations
    possible_operations:
        - simplification : "smaller areas get merged into neighbor areas"
        - filtering: 'local pixel operations based on color and neighbors'
