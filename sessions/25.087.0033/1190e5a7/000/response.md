*   **Perception**:
    *   The input grids consist of a background color and a line color.
    *   The line color forms a set of complete horizontal and vertical lines that partition the grid.
    *   The output grid's dimensions correspond to the number of rectangular regions created by these lines in the input grid.
    *   The output grid is filled entirely with the background color from the input grid.
    *   The line color itself is discarded in the output.

*   **Facts**:

        colors:
          background: 1 (blue)

          vertical_lines: 4 (at columns 6, 21, 23, 25)
        regions:

    task_properties:
      - identifies two primary colors: background and lines.
      - line color forms complete horizontal and/or vertical lines across the grid.
      - background color fills the rectangular areas between the lines.
      - transformation involves counting the regions formed by the lines.
      - output is a grid filled with the background color.
      - output dimensions are (number of horizontal regions) x (number of vertical regions).

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the "line color" which forms complete horizontal rows or complete vertical columns within the input grid.
    2.  Identify the "background color" which is the color filling the rectangular areas *not* occupied by the line color. (It's usually the most frequent color that isn't the line color).
    3.  Count the number of distinct horizontal lines formed by the line color. Let this count be `H`. The number of rows in the output grid will be `R = H + 1`.
    4.  Count the number of distinct vertical lines formed by the line color. Let this count be `V`. The number of columns in the output grid will be `C = V + 1`.
    5.  Create a new grid with dimensions `R` rows and `C` columns.
    6.  Fill this new grid entirely with the identified background color.
