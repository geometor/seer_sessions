Additionally, it features a hollow rectangle drawn using the same color as the input object.\n*   **Relationship:** The position and dimensions of the newly drawn rectangle in the output are determined by the locations of the gray pixels in the input. The color of the rectangle is determined by the color of the non-gray, non-background object in the input.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Define the boundaries of a new, inner rectangle: one row below the minimum gray row, one row above the maximum gray row, one column to the right of the minimum gray column, and one column to the left of the maximum gray column.\n6.  Draw the perimeter of this inner rectangle onto the output grid using the color identified in step 3. Only change pixels that are currently the background color (white/0). Do not overwrite the original object or the gray pixels."
