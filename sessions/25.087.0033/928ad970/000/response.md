Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** Contains a background (white/0), several scattered gray pixels (5), and a single contiguous object of another color (green/3, blue/1, or yellow/4).
*   **Output Grid:** Retains the original gray pixels and the colored object from the input. Additionally, it features a hollow rectangle drawn using the same color as the input object.
*   **Relationship:** The position and dimensions of the newly drawn rectangle in the output are determined by the locations of the gray pixels in the input. The color of the rectangle is determined by the color of the non-gray, non-background object in the input.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Observations:
  - Input grids contain three types of pixels:
      - Background: color 0 (white)
      - Markers: color 5 (gray)
      - Object: A single contiguous block of pixels with color C, where C is not 0 or 5.
  - Output grids contain the original markers and the original object.
  - Output grids also contain a new hollow rectangle drawn with color C.
Transformation_Rule:
  - Identify all gray marker pixels (color 5).
  - Determine the bounding box enclosing all gray pixels:
      - min_row: Minimum row index of any gray pixel.
      - max_row: Maximum row index of any gray pixel.
      - min_col: Minimum column index of any gray pixel.
      - max_col: Maximum column index of any gray pixel.
  - Identify the non-gray, non-background object and determine its color (C).
  - Define the coordinates for the new rectangle:
      - top_row = min_row + 1
      - bottom_row = max_row - 1
      - left_col = min_col + 1
      - right_col = max_col - 1
  - Draw the hollow rectangle onto the input grid using color C:
      - Draw the top edge: For col from left_col to right_col, set pixel (top_row, col) to C if it's currently background (0).
      - Draw the bottom edge: For col from left_col to right_col, set pixel (bottom_row, col) to C if it's currently background (0).
      - Draw the left edge: For row from top_row + 1 to bottom_row - 1, set pixel (row, left_col) to C if it's currently background (0).
      - Draw the right edge: For row from top_row + 1 to bottom_row - 1, set pixel (row, right_col) to C if it's currently background (0).
  - The final grid contains the original elements plus the newly drawn rectangle segments (only overwriting background pixels).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Locate all gray pixels in the input grid.
2.  Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by these gray pixels. These define an outer bounding box.
3.  Find the single connected object that is not gray and not the background color. Note its color.
4.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
5.  Define the boundaries of a new, inner rectangle: one row below the minimum gray row, one row above the maximum gray row, one column to the right of the minimum gray column, and one column to the left of the maximum gray column.
6.  Draw the perimeter of this inner rectangle onto the output grid using the color identified in step 3. Only change pixels that are currently the background color (white/0). Do not overwrite the original object or the gray pixels.
