Observations:
  - Input grids contain three types of pixels:
      - Background: color 0 (white)
      - Markers: color 5 (gray)
      - Object: A single contiguous block of pixels with color C, where C is not 0 or 5.
  - Output grids contain the original markers and the original object.
  - Output grids also contain a new hollow rectangle drawn with color C.
Transformation_Rule:
  - Identify all gray marker pixels (color 5).
  - Determine the bounding box enclosing all gray pixels:
      - min_row: Minimum row index of any gray pixel.
      - max_row: Maximum row index of any gray pixel.
      - min_col: Minimum column index of any gray pixel.
      - max_col: Maximum column index of any gray pixel.
  - Identify the non-gray, non-background object and determine its color (C).
  - Define the coordinates for the new rectangle:
      - top_row = min_row + 1
      - bottom_row = max_row - 1
      - left_col = min_col + 1
      - right_col = max_col - 1
  - Draw the hollow rectangle onto the input grid using color C:
      - Draw the top edge: For col from left_col to right_col, set pixel (top_row, col) to C if it's currently background (0).
      - Draw the bottom edge: For col from left_col to right_col, set pixel (bottom_row, col) to C if it's currently background (0).
      - Draw the left edge: For row from top_row + 1 to bottom_row - 1, set pixel (row, left_col) to C if it's currently background (0).
      - Draw the right edge: For row from top_row + 1 to bottom_row - 1, set pixel (row, right_col) to C if it's currently background (0).
  - The final grid contains the original elements plus the newly drawn rectangle segments (only overwriting background pixels).
