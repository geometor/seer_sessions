  description: "Draws vertical and horizontal lines extending from each non-white pixel to the nearest corresponding grid edge."
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_vary: True
    - background_color: white (0)
    - content: Contains isolated non-white pixels.

identified_objects:
  - name: source_pixel
    description: "An individual pixel in the input grid with a color other than white (0)."
    properties:
      - position: (row, column)
      - color: (1-9)
      - grid_height: H
      - grid_width: W
      - distance_to_top_edge: row
      - distance_to_bottom_edge: H - 1 - row

actions:
  - name: identify_source_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_source_pixels

  - name: determine_projection_directions
    input: source_pixel, grid_height, grid_width
    output: vertical_direction (up/down), horizontal_direction (left/right)
    logic: |
      vertical_direction = 'up' if distance_to_top_edge <= distance_to_bottom_edge else 'down'
      horizontal_direction = 'left' if distance_to_left_edge <= distance_to_right_edge else 'right'

  - name: draw_vertical_line
    input: output_grid, source_pixel, vertical_direction
    output: modified_output_grid
    logic: |
      Color pixels in the source_pixel's column with the source_pixel's color.
      If vertical_direction is 'up', color from row 0 to source_pixel.row (inclusive).
      If vertical_direction is 'down', color from source_pixel.row to grid_height - 1 (inclusive).

  - name: draw_horizontal_line
    input: output_grid, source_pixel, horizontal_direction
    output: modified_output_grid
    logic: |
      Color pixels in the source_pixel's row with the source_pixel's color.
      If horizontal_direction is 'left', color from column 0 to source_pixel.column (inclusive).
      If horizontal_direction is 'right', color from source_pixel.column to grid_width - 1 (inclusive).

relationships:
  - type: generation
    from: source_pixel
    to: vertical_line, horizontal_line
    details: "Each source pixel generates one vertical and one horizontal line of its own color."
  - type: dependency
    element: line_direction
    depends_on: source_pixel_position, grid_dimensions
    details: "The direction of projection depends on the relative distance of the source pixel to the grid edges."
  - type: composition
    element: output_grid
    composed_of: input_grid, all_generated_lines
    details: "The output grid starts as the input grid and is then modified by drawing all generated lines."

output_specification:
  - grid_size: Same as input grid size.
  - content: Input grid content overlaid with the generated vertical and horizontal lines originating from each source pixel.
