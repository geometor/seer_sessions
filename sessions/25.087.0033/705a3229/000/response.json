            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task operates on grids of varying sizes containing pixels of different colors (0-9). The background is always white (0).\n2.  **Key Elements:** The crucial elements in the input grids are the isolated, non-white pixels. There can be one or more such pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves extending lines from each non-white pixel towards the grid boundaries. Each non-white pixel generates exactly one vertical line and one horizontal line.\n4.  **Line Generation:**\n    *   A vertical line is drawn in the same column as the source pixel.\n    *   A horizontal line is drawn in the same row as the source pixel.\n    *   The color of the lines matches the color of the source pixel.\n5.  **Directionality:** The direction of the lines (up/down, left/right) seems determined by the source pixel's proximity to the edges. The lines extend towards the *closer* edge.\n    *   **Vertical:** If the pixel is closer to or equidistant from the top edge, the vertical line extends upwards from the top edge to the pixel's row. If it's closer to the bottom edge, the line extends downwards from the pixel's row to the bottom edge.\n    *   **Horizontal:** If the pixel is closer to or equidistant from the left edge, the horizontal line extends leftwards from the left edge to the pixel's column. If it's closer to the right edge, the line extends rightwards from the pixel's column to the right edge.\n6.  **Overlap:** The generated lines overwrite any existing pixels (including white background) in the output grid. The source pixel itself is part of both its vertical and horizontal lines.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
