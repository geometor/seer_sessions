task: color_change_based_on_shape
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    color: blue (1)
    description: Contiguous groups of blue pixels forming various shapes.
  - type: object
    color: green (3)
    description: Appears in the output, resulting from transforming specific blue shapes.

transformations:
  - action: identify_shapes
    input_color: blue (1)
    criteria:
      - shape_type: hollow_rectangle
      - description: A closed loop of blue pixels forming the perimeter of a rectangle, enclosing only white (0) pixels inside. The blue pixels must all lie on the boundary.
  - action: recolor
    input_color: blue (1)
    output_color: green (3)
    condition: Applies only to the blue pixels identified as part of a 'hollow_rectangle'.
    effect: The identified blue pixels are changed to green.
  - action: preserve
    description: All other pixels (white background and blue pixels not forming hollow rectangles) remain unchanged.

relationships:
  - The transformation depends on the geometric properties (shape, closure, interior content) of the blue objects.
  - Only blue objects meeting the specific 'hollow_rectangle' criteria are affected.
