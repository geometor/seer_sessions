The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, except that specific blue shapes have been recolored to green (3).\n\nObserving the examples:\n- In `train_1`, a 3x3 hollow blue square is changed to green, while another blue shape (an incomplete L-shape) remains blue.\n- In `train_2`, four distinct hollow blue rectangles of different sizes (4x3, 4x4, 3x4, 4x3) are changed to green. Other blue shapes (a C-shape, a vertical line, a horizontal line) remain blue.\n- In `train_3`, a 5x3 hollow blue rectangle is changed to green, while other blue pixels (forming an L-shape and isolated dots) remain blue.\n\nThe core transformation appears to be identifying blue shapes that form a \"hollow rectangle\" and changing the color of those blue pixels to green. A hollow rectangle is characterized by a closed boundary of blue pixels surrounding an area composed entirely of white pixels, with the overall shape fitting within a rectangular bounding box where the blue pixels only occupy the perimeter. Shapes that are not closed loops, are filled, or are non-rectangular are not affected.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
