Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input grids consist of a white background (0) and various shapes formed by blue pixels (1). The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, except that specific blue shapes have been recolored to green (3).

Observing the examples:
- In `train_1`, a 3x3 hollow blue square is changed to green, while another blue shape (an incomplete L-shape) remains blue.
- In `train_2`, four distinct hollow blue rectangles of different sizes (4x3, 4x4, 3x4, 4x3) are changed to green. Other blue shapes (a C-shape, a vertical line, a horizontal line) remain blue.
- In `train_3`, a 5x3 hollow blue rectangle is changed to green, while other blue pixels (forming an L-shape and isolated dots) remain blue.

The core transformation appears to be identifying blue shapes that form a "hollow rectangle" and changing the color of those blue pixels to green. A hollow rectangle is characterized by a closed boundary of blue pixels surrounding an area composed entirely of white pixels, with the overall shape fitting within a rectangular bounding box where the blue pixels only occupy the perimeter. Shapes that are not closed loops, are filled, or are non-rectangular are not affected.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task: color_change_based_on_shape
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    color: blue (1)
    description: Contiguous groups of blue pixels forming various shapes.
  - type: object
    color: green (3)
    description: Appears in the output, resulting from transforming specific blue shapes.

transformations:
  - action: identify_shapes
    input_color: blue (1)
    criteria:
      - shape_type: hollow_rectangle
      - description: A closed loop of blue pixels forming the perimeter of a rectangle, enclosing only white (0) pixels inside. The blue pixels must all lie on the boundary.
  - action: recolor
    input_color: blue (1)
    output_color: green (3)
    condition: Applies only to the blue pixels identified as part of a 'hollow_rectangle'.
    effect: The identified blue pixels are changed to green.
  - action: preserve
    description: All other pixels (white background and blue pixels not forming hollow rectangles) remain unchanged.

relationships:
  - The transformation depends on the geometric properties (shape, closure, interior content) of the blue objects.
  - Only blue objects meeting the specific 'hollow_rectangle' criteria are affected.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct connected components (objects) composed of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each identified blue object:
    a.  Determine the bounding box of the object.
    b.  Check if the object forms a hollow rectangle:
        i.  Verify that all blue pixels of the object lie exactly on the perimeter of its bounding box.
        ii. Verify that all pixels *inside* the bounding box (i.e., not on the perimeter) are white (0).
        iii. Verify that the blue pixels form a single, continuous closed loop around the perimeter.
    c.  If all conditions in step 3b are met (the object is a hollow rectangle):
        i.  Iterate through all the coordinates occupied by this blue object in the output grid.
        ii. Change the color of the pixel at each of these coordinates from blue (1) to green (3).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
