These shapes can be solid, hollow, or have more complex structures like the 'U' shape.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids retain the original Azure (8) background and the Magenta (6) shapes in their original positions. Two new colors appear: Green (3) and Yellow (4).\n3.  **Transformation - Green Pixels:** Green (3) pixels form a one-pixel-thick border around the exterior of each Magenta (6) shape. This border includes pixels that are diagonally adjacent to the Magenta shape. These Green pixels replace the original Azure (8) background pixels.\n4.  **Transformation - Yellow Pixels:** Yellow (4) pixels appear within some of the Magenta (6) shapes. Specifically, they fill areas that were originally Azure (8) background pixels but are \"enclosed\" by the Magenta shape.\n5.  **Enclosure Condition:** An area seems to be considered \"enclosed\" if the original Azure (8) pixels within it cannot reach the grid boundary by moving horizontally or vertically through other Azure (8) pixels or the newly added Green (3) border pixels (i.e., without crossing the Magenta (6) shape pixels).\n6.  **Size Condition for Yellow Fill:** There's a special case: if an enclosed area (a \"hole\") consists of only a single pixel, it is *not* filled with Yellow (4); it remains Azure (8). Only enclosed areas larger than one pixel are filled with Yellow (4).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify all Azure (8) pixels in the input grid that are adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to at least one Magenta (6) pixel.\n3.  Change the color of these identified pixels in the output grid to Green (3).\n4.  Identify all connected components of Azure (8) pixels in the output grid that cannot reach the boundary of the grid by moving only horizontally or vertically through Azure (8) or Green (3) pixels. These are the \"enclosed holes\".\n5.  For each identified enclosed hole:\n    a.  Count the number of pixels in the hole.\n    b.  If the pixel count is greater than 1, change the color of all pixels within that hole in the output grid to Yellow (4). Otherwise (if the count is 1), leave the pixel as Azure (8).\n6.  The final state of the output grid is the result."
