## General Assessment

The provided code failed on both training examples. The core issue lies in the interaction between the border creation step and the hole-filling step. The current code first adds a Green border by replacing Azure pixels adjacent to Magenta pixels. Then, it identifies enclosed holes by looking for remaining Azure pixels unreachable from the boundary and fills them with Yellow if the hole size is greater than one.

The failure occurs because some Azure pixels that *should* be part of a Yellow-filled hole are adjacent to Magenta pixels. These pixels are incorrectly converted to Green by the bordering step *before* the hole-filling step can identify them as part of an enclosed Azure region. Consequently, these pixels remain Green instead of becoming Yellow, and the hole-filling algorithm might only find smaller, disconnected parts of the actual hole (or miss it entirely if all internal pixels were adjacent to Magenta).

The strategy to resolve this is to modify the order of operations or the conditions:
1.  Identify the enclosed Azure regions based on the *original* input grid and determine which pixels should be filled with Yellow.
2.  Identify the Azure pixels that should form the Green border based on the *original* input grid.
3.  Construct the output grid by first placing the Magenta pixels, then the Yellow fills, and finally the Green border pixels (only where they don't conflict with a Yellow fill), leaving the rest as Azure.

## Metrics

Based on the comparison between `Expected Output` and `Transformed Output`:

**Example 1:**
-   Pixels Off: 14
-   Incorrect Pixels Breakdown:
    -   Expected Yellow (4), Got Green (3): 14 pixels
        -   2 pixels within the 'C' shape: `(4,3), (5,3)`
        -   12 pixels within the hollow rectangle: `(9,10), (9,11), (9,12), (9,13), (10,9), (10,13), (11,9), (11,13), (12,10), (12,11), (12,12), (12,13)`
    -   All errors occur where an Azure pixel in the input was both adjacent (including diagonal) to a Magenta pixel AND part of an enclosed region of size > 1.

**Example 2:**
-   Pixels Off: 4 (Note: The previous report mentioned 6, but comparing the provided outputs shows 4 differing pixels)
-   Incorrect Pixels Breakdown:
    -   Expected Yellow (4), Got Green (3): 4 pixels
        -   4 pixels within the top-right hollow square: `(4,9), (4,10), (5,9), (5,10)`
    -   Similar to Example 1, all errors occur where an Azure pixel in the input was both adjacent to Magenta and part of an enclosed region of size > 1.

      1. Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      2. Apply Yellow Fill: Change the color of pixels identified for Yellow fill to 4.
      3. Apply Green Border: Iterate through potential border pixels. If the corresponding pixel in the output grid is still Azure (8), change its color to Green (3). (Magenta and Yellow pixels are not overridden by Green).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects**: Locate all Magenta (6) pixels and all Azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Find Enclosed Azure Regions**:
    a.  Identify all distinct connected components of Azure (8) pixels in the input grid (using 8-way adjacency, including diagonals).
    b.  For each Azure component, determine if it is "enclosed". A component is enclosed if:
        i.  None of its pixels are on the border/edge of the grid.
        ii. All pixels immediately adjacent (including diagonals) to any pixel within the component, which are *not* part of the component itself, must be Magenta (6).
3.  **Mark Pixels for Yellow Fill**: Identify all enclosed Azure components found in step 2 that contain more than one pixel. Mark all pixels belonging to these larger enclosed components to be colored Yellow (4) in the output.
4.  **Mark Pixels for Green Border**: Identify all Azure (8) pixels in the input grid that are adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one Magenta (6) pixel. Mark these as *potential* Green (3) border pixels.
5.  **Construct Output Grid**:
    a.  Create a new grid, initially identical to the input grid.
    b.  Apply the Yellow fill: Change the color of all pixels marked for Yellow fill (from step 3) to Yellow (4).
    c.  Apply the Green border: Iterate through the pixels marked as potential Green borders (from step 4). For each such pixel, if its current color in the output grid is still Azure (8) (i.e., it wasn't turned Yellow in step 5b), change its color to Green (3).
    d.  Ensure all original Magenta (6) pixels remain Magenta in the output grid. All remaining pixels keep their original Azure (8) color.
6.  **Return** the final constructed output grid.
