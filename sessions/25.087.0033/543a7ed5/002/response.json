            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code failed on both training examples. The core issue lies in the interaction between the border creation step and the hole-filling step. The current code first adds a Green border by replacing Azure pixels adjacent to Magenta pixels. Then, it identifies enclosed holes by looking for remaining Azure pixels unreachable from the boundary and fills them with Yellow if the hole size is greater than one.\n\nThe failure occurs because some Azure pixels that *should* be part of a Yellow-filled hole are adjacent to Magenta pixels. These pixels are incorrectly converted to Green by the bordering step *before* the hole-filling step can identify them as part of an enclosed Azure region. Consequently, these pixels remain Green instead of becoming Yellow, and the hole-filling algorithm might only find smaller, disconnected parts of the actual hole (or miss it entirely if all internal pixels were adjacent to Magenta).\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to modify the order of operations or the conditions:\n1.  Identify the enclosed Azure regions based on the *original* input grid and determine which pixels should be filled with Yellow.\n2.  Identify the Azure pixels that should form the Green border based on the *original* input grid.\n3.  Construct the output grid by first placing the Magenta pixels, then the Yellow fills, and finally the Green border pixels (only where they don't conflict with a Yellow fill), leaving the rest as Azure.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the comparison between `Expected Output` and `Transformed Output`:\n\n**Example 1:**\n-   Pixels Off: 14\n-   Incorrect Pixels Breakdown:\n    -   Expected Yellow (4), Got Green (3): 14 pixels\n        -   2 pixels within the 'C' shape: `(4,3), (5,3)`\n        -   12 pixels within the hollow rectangle: `(9,10), (9,11), (9,12), (9,13), (10,9), (10,13), (11,9), (11,13), (12,10), (12,11), (12,12), (12,13)`\n    -   All errors occur where an Azure pixel in the input was both adjacent (including diagonal) to a Magenta pixel AND part of an enclosed region of size > 1.\n\n**Example 2:**\n-   Pixels Off: 4 (Note: The previous report mentioned 6, but comparing the provided outputs shows 4 differing pixels)\n-   Incorrect Pixels Breakdown:\n    -   Expected Yellow (4), Got Green (3): 4 pixels\n        -   4 pixels within the top-right hollow square: `(4,9), (4,10), (5,9), (5,10)`\n    -   Similar to Example 1, all errors occur where an Azure pixel in the input was both adjacent to Magenta and part of an enclosed region of size > 1.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
