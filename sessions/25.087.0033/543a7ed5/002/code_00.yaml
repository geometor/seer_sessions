task_context:
  description: The task involves modifying an Azure background containing Magenta shapes.
  grid_properties:
    - colors: Azure (8), Magenta (6), Green (3), Yellow (4)
    - background_color: Azure (8)
    - objects_color: Magenta (6)
input_objects:
  - object: Magenta Shape
    definition: Contiguous block(s) of Magenta (6) pixels. Can be solid or hollow.
    properties:
      - color: 6
      - shape: Variable (rectangles, C-shapes observed)
      - connectivity: 8-connectivity (including diagonals) seems relevant for defining the shape and its boundary.
  - object: Azure Background / Region
    definition: Contiguous block(s) of Azure (8) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: 8
      - location: Fills the grid, except for Magenta shapes. Some Azure regions might be enclosed by Magenta shapes.
output_objects:
  - object: Magenta Shape
    definition: Same as input Magenta shapes.
    properties:
      - color: 6
      - unchanged: Magenta shapes persist from input to output.
  - object: Green Border
    definition: Pixels surrounding the Magenta shapes.
    properties:
      - color: 3
      - location: Occupies pixels that were originally Azure (8) and were adjacent (including diagonals) to any Magenta (6) pixel, *unless* that pixel becomes part of a Yellow Fill.
      - thickness: 1 pixel wide, including diagonals.
  - object: Yellow Fill
    definition: Fills certain regions that were originally Azure.
    properties:
      - color: 4
      - location: Occupies pixels that were originally Azure (8) AND part of a connected component of Azure pixels completely enclosed by Magenta (6) pixels (using 8-connectivity for enclosure check) AND the size of that Azure component is greater than 1 pixel.
  - object: Azure Background
    definition: Remaining Azure pixels from the input.
    properties:
      - color: 8
      - location: Pixels that were Azure in the input and did not become Green Border or Yellow Fill. Includes enclosed single Azure pixels.
transformations:
  - action: Identify Enclosed Azure Regions
    input: Input Grid
    output: Sets of coordinates for enclosed Azure pixels, grouped by connected components.
    condition: An Azure pixel is part of an enclosed region if it belongs to a connected component of Azure pixels where none of the component's pixels touch the grid boundary, and all non-Azure, non-component pixels adjacent (including diagonals) to the component are Magenta (6).
  - action: Fill Large Enclosed Regions
    input: Enclosed Azure components
    output: Pixels to be colored Yellow (4).
    condition: An enclosed Azure component is filled with Yellow if its size (number of pixels) is greater than 1.
  - action: Identify Potential Border Pixels
    input: Input Grid
    output: Set of coordinates for potential Green border pixels.
    condition: An Azure (8) pixel is a potential border pixel if it is adjacent (including diagonals) to any Magenta (6) pixel.
  - action: Construct Output Grid
    steps:
      1. Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      2. Apply Yellow Fill: Change the color of pixels identified for Yellow fill to 4.
      3. Apply Green Border: Iterate through potential border pixels. If the corresponding pixel in the output grid is still Azure (8), change its color to Green (3). (Magenta and Yellow pixels are not overridden by Green).
