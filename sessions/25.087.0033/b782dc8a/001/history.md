Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example.
2.  **Dominant Colors:** The input grids primarily consist of white (0) and azure (8) pixels.
3.  **Barrier Color:** The azure (8) pixels appear to form static structures or boundaries that remain unchanged between the input and output grids. They act like walls.
4.  **Fill Colors:** Each input grid contains a small number of pixels of two other distinct colors besides white (0) and azure (8).
    *   In `train_1`, these colors are blue (1) and yellow (4).
    *   In `train_2`, these colors are green (3) and red (2).
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the white (0) pixels in the input grid to one of the two identified "fill" colors in the output grid. The azure (8) pixels and the original instances of the fill colors remain unchanged in their positions.
6.  **Pattern:** The replacement of white (0) pixels follows a consistent checkerboard pattern based on the pixel's coordinates (row and column index).
7.  **Color Assignment:** The specific fill color used for a white pixel depends on the parity of the sum of its row and column indices (`row + col`). One fill color is used for even parity, and the other is used for odd parity. By comparing `train_1` and `train_2`, it appears the numerically lower fill color is assigned to even parity (`(row + col) % 2 == 0`), and the numerically higher fill color is assigned to odd parity (`(row + col) % 2 == 1`).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Replace white pixels with a checkerboard pattern derived from two other colors present in the input, using azure pixels as static barriers.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors.
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0-9.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
      - type:
          - background: white (0) pixels that are subject to change.
          - barrier: azure (8) pixels that remain static.
          - fill_source: Non-white, non-barrier pixels present in the input (e.g., blue(1)/yellow(4) or green(3)/red(2)). These also remain static but define the fill colors.
          - fill_target: Pixels in the output that were originally white but are now one of the fill colors.
  - element: checkerboard_pattern
    properties:
      - based_on: Parity of the sum of pixel coordinates (row + col).
      - colors: Determined by the two fill_source colors found in the input grid.

relationships:
  - relationship: parity_to_color_assignment
    description: >
      The parity of (row + col) determines which of the two fill colors
      replaces a white pixel. The numerically lower fill color corresponds
      to even parity (0), and the numerically higher fill color corresponds
      to odd parity (1).
  - relationship: static_elements
    description: >
      Barrier pixels (azure/8) and the original fill_source pixels
      maintain their color and position from input to output.

actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    description: >
      Scan the input grid to find the barrier color (azure/8) and the two
      unique fill_source colors (excluding white/0 and azure/8).
  - action: sort_fill_colors
    description: >
      Determine which fill_source color is numerically lower (`color_low`)
      and which is numerically higher (`color_high`).
  - action: apply_pattern
    description: >
      Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel is white (0),
      calculate `(row + col) % 2`. If the result is 0, set the output pixel
      to `color_low`. If the result is 1, set the output pixel to `color_high`.
      Otherwise, copy the input pixel color to the output.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Identify the two unique "fill" colors present in the input grid, excluding white (0) and azure (8).
3.  Determine which of these two fill colors has the lower numerical value (let's call it `color_low`) and which has the higher numerical value (let's call it `color_high`).
4.  Iterate through each cell `(row, col)` of the input grid.
5.  Get the color `input_color` at `(row, col)`.
6.  Check if `input_color` is white (0).
    *   If yes:
        *   Calculate the parity: `parity = (row + col) % 2`.
        *   If `parity` is 0, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to `color_low`.
        *   If `parity` is 1, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to `color_high`.
    *   If no (the color is not white):
        *   Copy the `input_color` directly to the corresponding cell in the output grid.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
