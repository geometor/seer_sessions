"""
Transforms the input grid by replacing white (0) pixels with a checkerboard pattern using two other specific 'fill' colors found in the input grid. Azure (8) pixels act as static barriers and remain unchanged, as do the original instances of the fill colors. The checkerboard pattern assigns the numerically lower fill color to pixels where (row + column) is even, and the numerically higher fill color to pixels where (row + column) is odd.
