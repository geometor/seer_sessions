Azure (8) pixels act as static barriers, confining the fill.\n\n1.  **Identify Colors:** Find the two 'fill colors' (distinct from white 0 and azure 8). Sort them into `color_low` and `color_high`.\n2.  **Locate Seeds:** Find all pixels initially containing `color_low` or `color_high`.\n3.  **Determine Fillable Region:** Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the seed pixels. The search expands only into orthogonally adjacent white (0) pixels and is blocked by azure (8) pixels. Collect all reachable white pixel coordinates.\n4.  **Apply Checkerboard:** Create a copy of the input grid. For each white pixel coordinate found in the fillable region, replace its color: use `color_low` if (row + col) is even, and `color_high` if (row + col) is odd.\n5.  **Output:** Return the modified grid. Original azure, seed, and unconnected white pixels remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a bounded checkerboard fill pattern to white pixels connected to seed colors.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of list of int): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of list of int: The transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = grid.shape\n\n    # --- 1.
