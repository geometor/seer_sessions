task_description: Fill a specific region of white pixels with a checkerboard pattern, bounded by barriers and seeded by existing colors.

definitions:
  barrier_color: 8 (azure)
  background_color: 0 (white)
  fill_colors: Two distinct colors present in the input grid, excluding white(0) and azure(8).
  seed_pixels: Pixels in the input grid having one of the fill_colors.
  fillable_region: The set of white(0) pixels connected orthogonally to any seed_pixel, without crossing any barrier_color(8) pixels. Connectivity includes paths through other white pixels.
  checkerboard_pattern:
    rule: Assign color based on (row_index + column_index) % 2.
    color_low: The fill_color with the lower numerical value.
    color_high: The fill_color with the higher numerical value.
    mapping:
      - if (r + c) % 2 == 0, use color_low.
      - if (r + c) % 2 == 1, use color_high.

input_grid:
  objects:
    - type: pixels
      properties:
        - color: integer value (0-9)
        - position: (row, column)

output_grid:
  derivation: Derived from input_grid by modifying only the pixels within the fillable_region.
  objects:
    - type: pixels
      properties:
        - color: integer value (0-9)
        - position: (row, column)

transformation:
  - action: identify_colors
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: barrier_color, background_color, fill_colors (low and high)
  - action: find_seeds
    inputs: input_grid, fill_colors
    outputs: list of seed_pixel coordinates
  - action: determine_fillable_region
    inputs: input_grid, seed_pixels, background_color, barrier_color
    outputs: set of coordinates for fillable_region
    details: Use orthogonal flood fill or BFS starting from seed_pixels, expanding only into background_color pixels, stopping at barrier_color pixels.
  - action: apply_checkerboard
    inputs: fillable_region, color_low, color_high
    outputs: color mappings for pixels in fillable_region based on checkerboard_pattern rule.
  - action: construct_output_grid
    inputs: input_grid, fillable_region, checkerboard_mappings
    outputs: output_grid
    details: Create a copy of input_grid. For each coordinate in fillable_region, update the color in the copy using the calculated checkerboard_mappings. Pixels outside fillable_region retain their original input_grid color.

invariants:
  - Pixels with barrier_color(8) remain unchanged.
  - Pixels with the original fill_colors (seed_pixels) remain unchanged.
  - White(0) pixels outside the fillable_region remain unchanged.
  - Grid dimensions remain unchanged.
