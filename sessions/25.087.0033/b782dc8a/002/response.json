            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the failures and refine the understanding of the task.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the two \"fill\" colors (besides white and azure) and the checkerboard pattern based on `(row + col)` parity. However, it incorrectly applied this pattern to *all* white (0) pixels in the grid.\n\nThe comparison between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` clearly shows that only a *subset* of the original white pixels should be filled with the checkerboard pattern. The key challenge is to precisely define *which* white pixels undergo this transformation.\n\nObserving the examples, the white pixels that get filled seem to be part of a contiguous region that is somehow \"activated\" or \"seeded\" by the presence of the original fill colors within the input grid. The azure (8) pixels appear to act as boundaries or walls, containing the fill operation. White pixels outside these bounded, activated regions remain unchanged.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify Components:** Confirm the identification of fill colors (non-0, non-8) and the barrier color (8).\n2.  **Locate Seeds:** Find the initial positions of the fill colors in the input grid.\n3.  **Identify Fillable Region:** Determine the region of white (0) pixels that are connected (likely orthogonally or potentially diagonally) to the initial fill color pixels (\"seeds\"), treating azure (8) pixels as impassable barriers. This sounds like a flood fill or connected components algorithm starting from the seed locations, limited to white pixels and bounded by azure pixels.\n4.  **Apply Pattern:** Apply the checkerboard pattern *only* to the white pixels identified in the fillable region.\n5.  **Preserve Others:** Ensure all other pixels (azure, original fill colors, non-filled white) remain unchanged.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\nLet's analyze the connectivity of the incorrectly filled pixels in Example 1. We need to see if the white pixels that *shouldn't* have been filled are disconnected from the initial blue(1)/yellow(4) pixels when considering azure(8) as walls.\n\nExample 1 Input: Blue (1) at (8, 4), (9, 5), (10, 4); Yellow (4) at (9, 4).\nExample 1 Expected Output: Fill starts around these seeds.\nExample 1 Code Output: Fills *all* white, including areas like the top-left corner.\n\nLet's check a point like (0,0). In the input, it's white(0). In the expected output, it remains white(0). In the code's output, it becomes blue(1). Is (0,0) connected to the seed pixels (8,4), (9,4), (9,5), (10,4) via a path of only white(0) pixels, avoiding azure(8)? Visually, no. There are azure(8) barriers separating the top-left white area from the area containing the seeds.\n\nLet's use code to verify this concept by performing a flood fill from the seed pixels.\n"

This confirms the only error was filling *unconnected* white pixels.\n3.  **Connectivity:** The analysis used orthogonal connectivity (up, down, left, right). The fact that it perfectly matched the expected output suggests diagonal connectivity is likely not needed for defining the fill region in this task.\n4.  **Checkerboard Pattern:** Within the correctly identified fill region, the checkerboard pattern using the low/high fill colors based on `(r + c) % 2` parity holds true.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Identify the two \"fill colors\" by excluding white (0) and azure (8). Determine which is the numerically lower (`color_low`) and higher (`color_high`) fill color.\n2.  **Locate Seeds:** Find the coordinates of all pixels in the input grid that have either `color_low` or `color_high`. These are the \"seed pixels\".\n3.  **Find Fillable White Region:** Perform a flood fill (or similar connectivity search like BFS/DFS) starting from all seed pixels simultaneously. The fill should only expand into adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (0) pixels. The fill cannot enter or cross azure (8) pixels. Collect all white (0) pixel coordinates reached during this process. This set of coordinates constitutes the \"fillable region\".\n4.  **Apply Checkerboard:** Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid. Iterate through only the coordinates identified in the \"fillable region\". For each coordinate `(r, c)` in this region:\n    *   If `(r + c)` is even, set the output grid pixel at `(r, c)` to `color_low`.\n    *   If `(r + c)` is odd, set the output grid pixel at `(r, c)` to `color_high`.\n5.  **Finalize:** Ensure all pixels *not* in the \"fillable region\" retain their original color from the input grid. The resulting grid is the final output."
