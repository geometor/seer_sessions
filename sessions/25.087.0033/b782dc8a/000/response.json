            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example.\n2.  **Dominant Colors:** The input grids primarily consist of white (0) and azure (8) pixels.\n3.  **Barrier Color:** The azure (8) pixels appear to form static structures or boundaries that remain unchanged between the input and output grids. They act like walls.\n4.  **Fill Colors:** Each input grid contains a small number of pixels of two other distinct colors besides white (0) and azure (8).\n    *   In `train_1`, these colors are blue (1) and yellow (4).\n    *   In `train_2`, these colors are green (3) and red (2).\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the white (0) pixels in the input grid to one of the two identified \"fill\" colors in the output grid. The azure (8) pixels and the original instances of the fill colors remain unchanged in their positions.\n6.  **Pattern:** The replacement of white (0) pixels follows a consistent checkerboard pattern based on the pixel's coordinates (row and column index).\n7.  **Color Assignment:** The specific fill color used for a white pixel depends on the parity of the sum of its row and column indices (`row + col`). One fill color is used for even parity, and the other is used for odd parity. By comparing `train_1` and `train_2`, it appears the numerically lower fill color is assigned to even parity (`(row + col) % 2 == 0`), and the numerically higher fill color is assigned to odd parity (`(row + col) % 2 == 1`).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
