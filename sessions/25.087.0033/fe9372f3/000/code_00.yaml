Input:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - properties:
      - predominantly background color (white, 0)
      - contains a single contiguous object
      - object_color: red (2)
      - object_shape: plus sign ('+')
Output:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - properties:
      - same dimensions as input grid
      - contains the original input object unchanged
      - contains additional pixels filling the background area
Relationships:
  - origin_point: Center pixel of the input object (intersection of '+' bars)
  - added_pixels: Located only where input pixels were background color (0)
  - pixel_patterns:
      - type: lines radiating from origin_point
      - directions: horizontal, vertical, and both diagonals (top-left to bottom-right, top-right to bottom-left)
      - color_mapping:
          - diagonal lines: blue (1)
          - axis lines (horizontal/vertical):
              - if distance_along_axis % 3 == 1: yellow (4)
              - otherwise: azure (8)
Constraints:
  - Added pixels do not overwrite the original object.
  - Patterns extend to the grid boundaries.
  - distance_along_axis is the Manhattan distance for pixels on the horizontal or vertical line passing through the origin_point.
