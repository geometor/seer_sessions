            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Both input examples feature a relatively large grid predominantly filled with the background color (white, 0). Within each grid, there is a single, small, contiguous object made of red pixels (2). This object consistently takes the shape of a plus sign ('+').\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding inputs. The original red '+' object remains unchanged in its position and color. The key transformation is the addition of new pixels in the background area (where the input was white).\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The new pixels added in the output form distinct patterns originating from the center of the red '+' object in the input.\n    *   **Lines from Center:** Pixels are added along the four diagonal lines and the horizontal/vertical lines passing through the center of the original '+' object.\n    *   **Color Coding:**\n        *   Pixels added along the diagonals are blue (1).\n        *   Pixels added along the horizontal and vertical axes are primarily azure (8).\n        *   However, some pixels along the horizontal and vertical axes are yellow (4). These yellow pixels appear periodically.\n    *   **Periodicity of Yellow:** Observing the positions of the yellow pixels relative to the center of the '+' object:\n        *   In `train_1` (center at 3,3), yellow appears at (3,7), (3,10), (3,13). The column distances from the center (3) are 4, 7, 10.\n        *   In `train_2` (center at 4,4), yellow appears at (0,4), (11,4), (4,0), (4,8). The row/column distances from the center (4) are 4, 7, 4, 4 respectively.\n        *   In both cases, yellow appears when the distance along the axis (horizontal or vertical distance, `d_axis`) from the center satisfies `d_axis % 3 == 1`.\n    *   **Extent:** These patterns extend outwards from the center to the boundaries of the grid, filling only the cells that were originally white.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Determine the coordinates (center\\_row, center\\_col) of the central pixel of this object (the intersection point of the '+').\n3.  Create a new grid (the output grid) initialized as an exact copy of the input grid.\n4.  Iterate through each cell (row, col) of the grid dimensions.\n5.  For the current cell (row, col), check if its value in the *input* grid is the background color (white, 0).\n6.  If it is background, calculate the absolute difference in rows (`d_row = abs(row - center_row)`) and columns (`d_col = abs(col - center_col)`) from the center pixel.\n7.  Check the relationship between `d_row` and `d_col`:\n    *   **If `d_row == d_col` and `d_row > 0`:** The cell lies on a diagonal path from the center (excluding the center itself).
