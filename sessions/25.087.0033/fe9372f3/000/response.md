Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** Both input examples feature a relatively large grid predominantly filled with the background color (white, 0). Within each grid, there is a single, small, contiguous object made of red pixels (2). This object consistently takes the shape of a plus sign ('+').
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding inputs. The original red '+' object remains unchanged in its position and color. The key transformation is the addition of new pixels in the background area (where the input was white).
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The new pixels added in the output form distinct patterns originating from the center of the red '+' object in the input.
    *   **Lines from Center:** Pixels are added along the four diagonal lines and the horizontal/vertical lines passing through the center of the original '+' object.
    *   **Color Coding:**
        *   Pixels added along the diagonals are blue (1).
        *   Pixels added along the horizontal and vertical axes are primarily azure (8).
        *   However, some pixels along the horizontal and vertical axes are yellow (4). These yellow pixels appear periodically.
    *   **Periodicity of Yellow:** Observing the positions of the yellow pixels relative to the center of the '+' object:
        *   In `train_1` (center at 3,3), yellow appears at (3,7), (3,10), (3,13). The column distances from the center (3) are 4, 7, 10.
        *   In `train_2` (center at 4,4), yellow appears at (0,4), (11,4), (4,0), (4,8). The row/column distances from the center (4) are 4, 7, 4, 4 respectively.
        *   In both cases, yellow appears when the distance along the axis (horizontal or vertical distance, `d_axis`) from the center satisfies `d_axis % 3 == 1`.
    *   **Extent:** These patterns extend outwards from the center to the boundaries of the grid, filling only the cells that were originally white.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - properties:
      - predominantly background color (white, 0)
      - contains a single contiguous object
      - object_color: red (2)
      - object_shape: plus sign ('+')
Output:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - properties:
      - same dimensions as input grid
      - contains the original input object unchanged
      - contains additional pixels filling the background area
Relationships:
  - origin_point: Center pixel of the input object (intersection of '+' bars)
  - added_pixels: Located only where input pixels were background color (0)
  - pixel_patterns:
      - type: lines radiating from origin_point
      - directions: horizontal, vertical, and both diagonals (top-left to bottom-right, top-right to bottom-left)
      - color_mapping:
          - diagonal lines: blue (1)
          - axis lines (horizontal/vertical):
              - if distance_along_axis % 3 == 1: yellow (4)
              - otherwise: azure (8)
Constraints:
  - Added pixels do not overwrite the original object.
  - Patterns extend to the grid boundaries.
  - distance_along_axis is the Manhattan distance for pixels on the horizontal or vertical line passing through the origin_point.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the single contiguous non-background object in the input grid (it will be a red '+' shape).
2.  Determine the coordinates (center\_row, center\_col) of the central pixel of this object (the intersection point of the '+').
3.  Create a new grid (the output grid) initialized as an exact copy of the input grid.
4.  Iterate through each cell (row, col) of the grid dimensions.
5.  For the current cell (row, col), check if its value in the *input* grid is the background color (white, 0).
6.  If it is background, calculate the absolute difference in rows (`d_row = abs(row - center_row)`) and columns (`d_col = abs(col - center_col)`) from the center pixel.
7.  Check the relationship between `d_row` and `d_col`:
    *   **If `d_row == d_col` and `d_row > 0`:** The cell lies on a diagonal path from the center (excluding the center itself). Set the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to blue (1).
    *   **Else if (`d_row == 0` and `d_col > 0`) or (`d_col == 0` and `d_row > 0`):** The cell lies on the horizontal or vertical axis passing through the center (excluding the center itself).
        *   Calculate the distance along the axis: `d_axis = max(d_row, d_col)`.
        *   **If `d_axis % 3 == 1`:** Set the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to yellow (4).
        *   **Else (if `d_axis % 3 != 1`):** Set the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to azure (8).
8.  If the cell in the input grid was not background, or if it was background but did not meet the diagonal or axis conditions, its value in the output grid remains unchanged from the initial copy.
9.  After checking all cells, the resulting output grid is the final result.
