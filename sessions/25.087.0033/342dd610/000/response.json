These non-background pixels are always the same color within a single example.\n    *   Example 1: Two orange (7) pixels.\n    *   Example 2: Two red (2) pixels.\n    *   Example 3: One maroon (9) pixel.\n    *   Example 4: Two blue (1) pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves moving the foreground (non-azure) pixels to new locations. The background (azure) pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  **Movement Pattern:** The direction and distance of the movement seem to depend entirely on the *color* of the foreground pixels.\n    *   Orange (7) pixels move 2 steps up.\n    *   Red (2) pixels move 2 steps left.\n    *   Maroon (9) pixels move 2 steps down.\n    *   Blue (1) pixels move 1 step right.\n6.  **Consistency:** All foreground pixels within a single grid undergo the exact same translation (movement).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Record their coordinates and their common color.\n3.  Based on the identified common color, determine the movement vector (change in row, change in column) as follows:\n    *   If the color is blue (1), the vector is (0, 1).\n    *   If the color is red (2), the vector is (0, -2).\n    *   If the color is orange (7), the vector is (-2, 0).\n    *   If the color is maroon (9), the vector is (2, 0).\n4.  Create a new grid, initially identical to the input grid.\n5.  For each non-background pixel identified in step 2:\n    *   Set its original position in the new grid to the background color (azure, 8).\n6.  For each non-background pixel identified in step 2:\n    *   Calculate its new position by adding the determined movement vector to its original coordinates.\n    *   Set the calculated new position in the new grid to the pixel's color.\n7.  The resulting new grid is the output."
