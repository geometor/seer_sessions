task_type: object_modification
input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of pixels (integers 0-9)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      type: solid_rectangle
      color: any color except white (0)
      properties: [color, position, height, width]
output_features:
  - grid: 2D array of pixels (integers 0-9)
  - background_color: white (0) (unchanged)
  - objects:
      type: hollow_rectangle (original solid rectangle with interior removed)
      border_color: same as the original solid rectangle's color
      interior_color: white (0)
      properties: [border_color, position, height, width] # Position, height, width match original
relationships:
  - finds all solid rectangular objects in the input grid.
  - preserves the 1-pixel thick border of each identified rectangle.
  - replaces the interior pixels (non-border pixels within the rectangle) of each identified rectangle with the background color (white, 0).
  - pixels not part of any identified solid rectangle remain unchanged.
