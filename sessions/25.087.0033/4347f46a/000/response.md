Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves processing grids containing solid rectangular shapes of various colors against a white (0) background. The transformation consistently modifies these rectangles by "hollowing" them out, changing their interior pixels to white while preserving their original colored borders.

*   **Objects:** The primary objects are solid rectangles defined by a single, non-white color. The background is consistently white (0).
*   **Properties:** Objects are characterized by their color, shape (rectangle), size (height and width), and position.
*   **Action:** The core action is modifying the interior of these rectangular objects.
*   **Transformation:** The interior pixels of each identified solid rectangle are changed to white (0). The border pixels (the outermost layer of the rectangle) retain their original color. Pixels outside these rectangles remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_modification
input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of pixels (integers 0-9)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      type: solid_rectangle
      color: any color except white (0)
      properties: [color, position, height, width]
output_features:
  - grid: 2D array of pixels (integers 0-9)
  - background_color: white (0) (unchanged)
  - objects:
      type: hollow_rectangle (original solid rectangle with interior removed)
      border_color: same as the original solid rectangle's color
      interior_color: white (0)
      properties: [border_color, position, height, width] # Position, height, width match original
relationships:
  - finds all solid rectangular objects in the input grid.
  - preserves the 1-pixel thick border of each identified rectangle.
  - replaces the interior pixels (non-border pixels within the rectangle) of each identified rectangle with the background color (white, 0).
  - pixels not part of any identified solid rectangle remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all distinct solid rectangular regions in the input grid where the pixels within the region all share the same non-white color.
2.  For each identified solid rectangle:
    a.  Determine its bounding box (top row, bottom row, left column, right column).
    b.  Iterate through all pixels within this bounding box.
    c.  If a pixel is *not* on the outermost edge (i.e., not in the top row, bottom row, left column, or right column of the bounding box), change its color to white (0).
    d.  Leave the pixels on the outermost edge unchanged (preserving the border).
3.  Leave all pixels in the input grid that are not part of any identified solid rectangle unchanged.
4.  The modified grid is the output.
