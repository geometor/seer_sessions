The transformation consistently modifies these rectangles by \"hollowing\" them out, changing their interior pixels to white while preserving their original colored borders.\n\n*   **Objects:** The primary objects are solid rectangles defined by a single, non-white color. The background is consistently white (0).\n*   **Properties:** Objects are characterized by their color, shape (rectangle), size (height and width), and position.\n*   **Action:** The core action is modifying the interior of these rectangular objects.\n*   **Transformation:** The interior pixels of each identified solid rectangle are changed to white (0). The border pixels (the outermost layer of the rectangle) retain their original color. Pixels outside these rectangles remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
