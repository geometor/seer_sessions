"""
Identify all 5x5 subgrids in the input that correspond to the bounding boxes of connected non-white pixel groups. 
Construct a 5x5 output grid. 
For each position (r, c) in the output grid, determine the color by examining the pixels at the relative position (r, c) within all identified 5x5 input subgrids. 
If all these corresponding pixels share the exact same color, that color is assigned to the output grid's (r, c) position. 
If the colors differ at that position across the input subgrids, assign white (0) to the output grid's (r, c) position.
