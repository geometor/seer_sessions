**Analysis of Code Execution:**

1.  **Dominant Color:** Correctly identified as 6 (magenta).
2.  **Found Blocks:** The blocks found match my manual inspection (after correction). There are 5 such blocks.
3.  **Predicted Output (Revised Rule):** The predicted output using the "union" rule (if dominant color appears at least once, use it, otherwise white, provided only dominant/white are present) results in an *all magenta* grid. This is *also incorrect*. The expected output has white pixels.

**Third Hypothesis - Intersection Logic:**

What if the rule is closer to an intersection?
Let's revisit the original code's logic: "If all corresponding pixels across the found 5x5 blocks are the *exact same color*, use that color; otherwise, use white."
This failed because it turned pixels white even if the variation was only between the dominant color and white.

Consider a modification:
**Revised Combination Rule v2 (Intersection-like):** For each position (r, c):
1.  Examine the colors at position (r, c) in all identified 5x5 input blocks.
2.  Identify the dominant non-white color (e.g., magenta 6).
3.  If the color at (r, c) is the *dominant color* in *all* blocks, the output is the dominant color.
4.  If the color at (r, c) is *white (0)* in *all* blocks, the output is white (0).
5.  In *all other cases* (mix of dominant/white, mix with other colors, etc.), the output is white (0).

Let's test this v2 rule mentally on Example 1:
*   Position (1,1): All 6 -> Output 6. Correct.
*   Position (1,2): {6, 0, 0, 6, 6} -> Mixed -> Output 0. Correct.
*   Position (1,3): {6, 6, 6, 0, 6} -> Mixed -> Output 0. Incorrect (Expected 6).
*   Position (2,1): {6, 6, 6, 6, 6} -> All 6 -> Output 6. Correct.
*   Position (2,2): {6, 6, 0, 6, 0} -> Mixed -> Output 0. Incorrect (Expected 6).

This isn't working either. The results from the original code execution are the closest so far, just with *too many* white pixels.

Let's re-examine the difference between the original code's output and the expected output for Ex 1:
Original Output:

```
6 6 6 6 6
6 0 0 0 6  <- Row 1 (0-indexed)
6 0 6 0 6  <- Row 2
6 0 6 0 6  <- Row 3
6 6 6 6 6
```

Expected Output:

```
6 6 6 6 6
6 0 6 0 6  <- Row 1
6 6 6 6 6  <- Row 2
6 0 6 6 6  <- Row 3
6 6 6 6 6
```

Differences:
(1,2): Code=0, Expected=6. Blocks: {6, 0, 0, 6, 6}. Rule: All must match. Fails -> 0.
(1,3): Code=0, Expected=0. Blocks: {6, 6, 6, 0, 6}. Rule: All must match. Fails -> 0. OK.
(2,1): Code=0, Expected=6. Blocks: {6, 6, 6, 6, 6}. Rule: All must match. Succeeds -> 6. **Wait, why did the code output 0 here?** Let me re-run the *original* code logic carefully.

Original Rule: If all `found_blocks[i][r_out, c_out]` are identical, use that color. Otherwise, use 0.

Position (2,1): Blocks: {6, 6, 6, 6, 6}. All are 6. Output should be 6. Code output was 0. Why?
Position (3,1): Blocks: {6, 6, 6, 0, 6}. Mixed. Output should be 0. Code output was 0. OK.
Position (3,3): Blocks: {6, 6, 6, 6, 6}. All are 6. Output should be 6. Code output was 0. Why?
Position (3,4): Blocks: {6, 6, 0, 6, 0}. Mixed. Output should be 0. Code output was 0. OK.

There must be a bug in the *implementation* of the original logic in the provided code, specifically around how consistency is checked or how the output grid is assigned.

Let's re-read the original code's loop:

```python
    output_grid = np.zeros((block_size, block_size), dtype=int)
    for r_out in range(block_size):
        for c_out in range(block_size):
            reference_color = found_blocks[0][r_out, c_out] # Takes color from the *first* block
            is_consistent = True 
            for i in range(1, len(found_blocks)): # Compares against the first block's color
                current_color = found_blocks[i][r_out, c_out]
                if current_color != reference_color:
                    is_consistent = False
                    break 
            
            if is_consistent:
                output_grid[r_out, c_out] = reference_color # Uses the first block's color if consistent
            else:
                output_grid[r_out, c_out] = 0 
```

This logic looks correct for the "all must match" rule. Why did it produce the wrong results?

Let's re-trace Ex 1, Pos (2,1): Blocks: {6, 6, 6, 6, 6}.
`reference_color` = Block[0][2,1] = 0.
Loop `i` from 1 to 4:
i=1: `current_color` = Block[1][2,1] = 6. `current_color` (6) != `reference_color` (0). `is_consistent` = False. Break.
`if is_consistent` is False. `output_grid[2,1] = 0`.

**AHA!** The error is subtle. The `find_objects` function correctly identifies the bounding box of the *connected non-white component*. However, the `get_subgrid` then extracts the 5x5 area from the *original grid*, including any white pixels *within* that bounding box. This seems correct based on the problem description.

Let's re-check the blocks for Ex 1, Pos (2,1):
Block 1 (Top-Left: (1,1)): Pos (2,1) -> Input Grid (1+2, 1+1) = (3,2) -> Value 0.
Block 2 (Top-Left: (1,12)): Pos (2,1) -> Input Grid (1+2, 12+1) = (3,13) -> Value 6.
Block 3 (Top-Left: (7,7)): Pos (2,1) -> Input Grid (7+2, 7+1) = (9,8) -> Value 0.
Block 4 (Top-Left: (9,1)): Pos (2,1) -> Input Grid (9+2, 1+1) = (11,2) -> Value 6.
Block 5 (Top-Left: (11,14)): Pos (2,1) -> Input Grid (11+2, 14+1) = (13,15) -> Value 0.

Colors at (2,1) relative position: {0, 6, 0, 6, 0}.
Original code logic: `reference_color` = 0. Check others against 0. Block 2 has 6. Inconsistent. Output = 0. Expected = 6. INCORRECT.

Let's re-check Ex 1, Pos (1,2):
Block 1 (1,1): Pos (1,2) -> Input (1+1, 1+2) = (2,3) -> 6.
Block 2 (1,12): Pos (1,2) -> Input (1+1, 12+2) = (2,14) -> 6.
Block 3 (7,7): Pos (1,2) -> Input (7+1, 7+2) = (8,9) -> 6.
Block 4 (9,1): Pos (1,2) -> Input (9+1, 1+2) = (10,3) -> 0.
Block 5 (11,14): Pos (1,2) -> Input (11+1, 14+2) = (12,16) -> 6.

Colors at (1,2) relative position: {6, 6, 6, 0, 6}.
Original code logic: `reference_color` = 6. Check others against 6. Block 4 has 0. Inconsistent. Output = 0. Expected = 6. INCORRECT.

Okay, the original code's *logic* ("all must be identical") combined with its *implementation* (comparing against the first block) consistently produces white pixels where the expected output has the dominant color, specifically when the set of colors includes both the dominant color and white.

**Fourth Hypothesis - Dominant Color Preservation:**

What if the rule focuses *only* on the dominant color?

**Revised Combination Rule v3:** For each position (r, c):
1.  Find the dominant non-white color across the entire input grid.
2.  Identify all 5x5 subgrids whose bounding box corresponds to a connected component of non-white pixels.
3.  Examine the colors at position (r, c) in all identified 5x5 input blocks.
4.  If the color at (r, c) is the *dominant color* in *all* the blocks, the output pixel at (r, c) is the dominant color.
5.  Otherwise, the output pixel at (r, c) is white (0).

Let's test this v3 rule mentally on Example 1:
*   Pos (1,1): Colors {6, 6, 6, 6, 6}. All are dominant (6). Output: 6. Correct.
*   Pos (1,2): Colors {6, 6, 6, 0, 6}. Not all are dominant (6). Output: 0. Correct.
*   Pos (1,3): Colors {6, 6, 0, 6, 6}. Not all are dominant (6). Output: 0. Incorrect (Expected 6).
*   Pos (2,1): Colors {0, 6, 0, 6, 0}. Not all are dominant (6). Output: 0. Incorrect (Expected 6).
*   Pos (2,2): Colors {6, 6, 6, 6, 0}. Not all are dominant (6). Output: 0. Incorrect (Expected 6).

This is also not correct. It generates even more white pixels than the original code.

**Let's reconsider the structure.** The output seems to be a "consensus" pattern. Maybe we should find the *most frequent* color at each position?

**Revised Combination Rule v4 (Majority/Mode Rule):** For each position (r, c):
1.  Identify all 5x5 subgrids based on connected components' bounding boxes.
2.  Examine the colors at position (r, c) in all identified blocks.
3.  Find the most frequent color at this position across all blocks.
4.  If there is a unique most frequent color, use that color for the output pixel at (r, c).
5.  If there is a tie for the most frequent color, use white (0).

Let's test this v4 rule mentally on Example 1 (Dominant=6):
*   Pos (1,1): Colors {6, 6, 6, 6, 6}. Freq: {6: 5}. Mode=6. Output: 6. Correct.
*   Pos (1,2): Colors {6, 0, 0, 6, 6}. Freq: {6: 3, 0: 2}. Mode=6. Output: 6. Incorrect (Expected 0).
*   Pos (1,3): Colors {6, 6, 0, 6, 6}. Freq: {6: 4, 0: 1}. Mode=6. Output: 6. Correct.
*   Pos (1,4): Colors {6, 0, 6, 6, 0}. Freq: {6: 3, 0: 2}. Mode=6. Output: 6. Incorrect (Expected 0).
*   Pos (2,1): Colors {0, 6, 0, 6, 0}. Freq: {0: 3, 6: 2}. Mode=0. Output: 0. Incorrect (Expected 6).
*   Pos (2,2): Colors {6, 6, 6, 6, 0}. Freq: {6: 4, 0: 1}. Mode=6. Output: 6. Correct.

This rule gets some right, some wrong. It seems closer but still not perfect.

**What if we only count non-white colors for the mode?**

**Revised Combination Rule v5 (Non-White Mode Rule):** For each position (r, c):
1.  Identify all 5x5 subgrids.
2.  Examine the colors at position (r, c) in all identified blocks.
3.  Filter out the white (0) pixels.
4.  If *any* non-white pixels remain:
    a. Find the most frequent non-white color among the remaining pixels.
    b. If there is a unique most frequent non-white color, use that color for the output pixel.
    c. If there is a tie, or if different non-white colors were present, use white (0).
5.  If *only* white (0) pixels were present at this position across all blocks, use white (0).

Let's test this v5 rule mentally on Example 1 (Dominant=6):
*   Pos (1,1): Colors {6, 6, 6, 6, 6}. Non-white: {6, 6, 6, 6, 6}. Mode=6. Output: 6. Correct.
*   Pos (1,2): Colors {6, 0, 0, 6, 6}. Non-white: {6, 6, 6}. Mode=6. Output: 6. Incorrect (Expected 0).
*   Pos (1,3): Colors {6, 6, 0, 6, 6}. Non-white: {6, 6, 6, 6}. Mode=6. Output: 6. Correct.
*   Pos (1,4): Colors {6, 0, 6, 6, 0}. Non-white: {6, 6, 6}. Mode=6. Output: 6. Incorrect (Expected 0).
*   Pos (2,1): Colors {0, 6, 0, 6, 0}. Non-white: {6, 6}. Mode=6. Output: 6. Correct.
*   Pos (2,2): Colors {6, 6, 6, 6, 0}. Non-white: {6, 6, 6, 6}. Mode=6. Output: 6. Correct.
*   Pos (3,4): Colors {6, 6, 0, 0, 0}. Non-white: {6, 6}. Mode=6. Output: 6. Correct.

This v5 rule seems very close! It only gets (1,2) and (1,4) wrong for Example 1. Why are those expected to be 0?
*   Pos (1,2): Colors {6, 0, 0, 6, 6}. Expected 0.
*   Pos (1,4): Colors {6, 0, 6, 6, 0}. Expected 0.

Maybe the rule is simpler: preserve the dominant color if it's the *only* non-white color present at that position across all blocks?

**Revised Combination Rule v6 (Sole Non-White Preservation):** For each position (r, c):
1.  Identify all 5x5 subgrids.
2.  Find the dominant non-white color (D) for the input grid.
3.  Examine the colors {c1, c2, ... cn} at position (r, c) in all identified blocks.
4.  Check if all non-white colors in {c1, c2, ... cn} are equal to D.
5.  If yes (i.e., the set of colors only contains D and potentially 0), AND if D is present at least once, then the output pixel is D.
6.  Otherwise (if only 0 is present, or if any other non-white color besides D is present), the output pixel is white (0).

Let's test this v6 rule mentally on Example 1 (Dominant=6):
*   Pos (1,1): Colors {6, 6, 6, 6, 6}. Only non-white is 6. 6 is present. Output: 6. Correct.
*   Pos (1,2): Colors {6, 0, 0, 6, 6}. Only non-white is 6. 6 is present. Output: 6. Incorrect (Expected 0).
*   Pos (1,3): Colors {6, 6, 0, 6, 6}. Only non-white is 6. 6 is present. Output: 6. Correct.
*   Pos (1,4): Colors {6, 0, 6, 6, 0}. Only non-white is 6. 6 is present. Output: 6. Incorrect (Expected 0).
*   Pos (2,1): Colors {0, 6, 0, 6, 0}. Only non-white is 6. 6 is present. Output: 6. Correct.
*   Pos (2,2): Colors {6, 6, 6, 6, 0}. Only non-white is 6. 6 is present. Output: 6. Correct.
*   Pos (3,4): Colors {6, 6, 0, 0, 0}. Only non-white is 6. 6 is present. Output: 6. Correct.

This rule is *identical* in outcome to Rule v5 for Example 1. It still fails on (1,2) and (1,4).

Let's reconsider the original code's output and logic.
Original Output:

```
6 6 6 6 6
6 0 0 0 6
6 0 6 0 6
6 0 6 0 6
6 6 6 6 6
```

Expected Output:

```
6 6 6 6 6
6 0 6 0 6
6 6 6 6 6
6 0 6 6 6
6 6 6 6 6
```

The original code was *too strict* - it required perfect consistency.
Rule v5/v6 was *too lenient* - it preserved the dominant color whenever it was the only non-white color present.

Maybe the definition of the "blocks" is wrong? The code finds connected components of *any* non-white color and uses their 5x5 bounding box. What if the objects are defined differently?

Looking at the inputs, the non-white shapes are always solid blocks of a single color (magenta, azure, red, orange). The `find_objects` seems okay, as does the 5x5 bounding box condition.

Is there something special about the positions that *should* be white in the output?
Ex 1: Expected white at (1,1), (1,3). (Using 0-based indexing).
Pos (1,1): Colors {6, 0, 0, 6, 6}. Expected 0. Rule v5/v6 gives 6. Original code gives 0.
Pos (1,3): Colors {6, 0, 6, 6, 0}. Expected 0. Rule v5/v6 gives 6. Original code gives 0.

It seems the original code's strict consistency check ("all pixels must match exactly") correctly identifies the white pixels in the output. The problem is that it *incorrectly* identifies some other pixels as white when they should be the dominant color.

Let's combine:
1.  Use the strict consistency check: If all blocks have the *exact same* color at (r,c), use that color.
2.  If the consistency check fails (i.e., colors are mixed):
    a. Check if the mix *only* contains the dominant color (D) and white (0).
    b. If yes, AND the dominant color D appears *more often* than white (0), set output to D.
    c. Otherwise (mix includes other colors, or white is more frequent/equal), set output to 0.

**Revised Combination Rule v7 (Strict + Dominant Majority):** For each position (r, c):
1.  Identify all 5x5 subgrids.
2.  Find the dominant non-white color (D) for the input grid.
3.  Examine the colors {c1, c2, ... cn} at position (r, c) in all identified blocks.
4.  Check for strict consistency: Are all colors in the set identical?
    a. If yes, use that color for the output pixel.
    b. If no (colors are mixed):
        i. Check if the set of colors contains *only* D and 0.
        ii. If yes: Count occurrences of D (count_D) and 0 (count_0). If count_D > count_0, set output pixel to D. Otherwise, set output pixel to 0.
        iii. If no (the mix contains colors other than D and 0), set output pixel to 0.

Let's test v7 on Example 1 (Dominant=6):
*   Pos (1,1): Colors {6, 6, 6, 6, 6}. Strict=Yes. Output: 6. Correct.
*   Pos (1,2): Colors {6, 0, 0, 6, 6}. Strict=No. Mix={6,0}? Yes. Count(6)=3, Count(0)=2. 3>2? Yes. Output: 6. Incorrect (Expected 0).
*   Pos (1,3): Colors {6, 6, 0, 6, 6}. Strict=No. Mix={6,0}? Yes. Count(6)=4, Count(0)=1. 4>1? Yes. Output: 6. Correct.
*   Pos (1,4): Colors {6, 0, 6, 6, 0}. Strict=No. Mix={6,0}? Yes. Count(6)=3, Count(0)=2. 3>2? Yes. Output: 6. Incorrect (Expected 0).
*   Pos (2,1): Colors {0, 6, 0, 6, 0}. Strict=No. Mix={6,0}? Yes. Count(6)=2, Count(0)=3. 2>3? No. Output: 0. Incorrect (Expected 6).
*   Pos (2,2): Colors {6, 6, 6, 6, 0}. Strict=No. Mix={6,0}? Yes. Count(6)=4, Count(0)=1. 4>1? Yes. Output: 6. Correct.
*   Pos (3,4): Colors {6, 6, 0, 0, 0}. Strict=No. Mix={6,0}? Yes. Count(6)=2, Count(0)=3. 2>3? No. Output: 0. Incorrect (Expected 6).

This is also not working reliably. The simple rules seem insufficient.

Let's rethink the goal. The output looks like a "cleaned up" or "prototypical" version of the input patterns. The process seems to be: find all examples of a 5x5 pattern, and then determine the underlying template. Pixels that are *always* the same color across all examples are kept. Pixels that *vary* are treated differently.

What is the exact rule for variation?
Original Code: Vary -> White
Expected Output: Varies -> Sometimes White, Sometimes Dominant Color.

When does variation result in the Dominant Color?
Ex 1:
Pos (1,3): {6, 6, 0, 6, 6} -> Expected 6.
Pos (2,1): {0, 6, 0, 6, 0} -> Expected 6.
Pos (2,2): {6, 6, 6, 6, 0} -> Expected 6.
Pos (2,4): {0, 6, 6, 6, 6} -> Expected 6.
Pos (3,4): {6, 6, 0, 0, 0} -> Expected 6.

When does variation result in White?
Ex 1:
Pos (1,2): {6, 0, 0, 6, 6} -> Expected 0.
Pos (1,4): {6, 0, 6, 6, 0} -> Expected 0.
Pos (3,1): {6, 6, 0, 6, 0} -> Expected 0.

Observation: In all cases where the expected output is the dominant color despite variation, the variation is *only* between the dominant color and white.
In all cases where the expected output is white, the variation is *also* only between the dominant color and white.

This means the rule isn't just *whether* variation exists, or *what* colors are involved in the variation, but potentially *how much* variation, or maybe something else entirely.

Let's re-examine the block identification. Does `find_objects` using 8-way connectivity and `!=0` condition always find the right shapes? Yes, it seems to capture the intended patterns correctly based on the code execution results. The bounding boxes are also correct.

Is it possible the output depends on the *position* within the 5x5 grid? No, that seems unlikely for ARC tasks.

Let's reconsider the simple "intersection" idea (Rule v3): Output is dominant color only if ALL blocks have dominant color at that position, otherwise white.
Test v3 on Ex 1:
*   Pos (1,1): All 6 -> Output 6. Correct.
*   Pos (1,2): {6,0,0,6,6} -> Not all 6 -> Output 0. Correct.
*   Pos (1,3): {6,6,0,6,6} -> Not all 6 -> Output 0. Incorrect (Expected 6).
*   Pos (1,4): {6,0,6,6,0} -> Not all 6 -> Output 0. Correct.
*   Pos (2,1): {0,6,0,6,0} -> Not all 6 -> Output 0. Incorrect (Expected 6).
*   Pos (2,2): {6,6,6,6,0} -> Not all 6 -> Output 0. Incorrect (Expected 6).
*   Pos (2,3): {6,6,6,6,6} -> All 6 -> Output 6. Correct.
*   Pos (2,4): {0,6,6,6,6} -> Not all 6 -> Output 0. Incorrect (Expected 6).
*   Pos (3,1): {6,6,0,6,0} -> Not all 6 -> Output 0. Correct.
*   Pos (3,4): {6,6,0,0,0} -> Not all 6 -> Output 0. Incorrect (Expected 6).

This rule correctly predicts the white pixels but fails on many dominant color pixels.

Let's reconsider the "union" idea (Rule v6): Output is dominant color if only dominant/white are present and dominant is present at least once, otherwise white.
Test v6 on Ex 1:
*   Pos (1,1): {6,6,6,6,6}. Only 6&0? Yes. 6 present? Yes. -> Output 6. Correct.
*   Pos (1,2): {6,0,0,6,6}. Only 6&0? Yes. 6 present? Yes. -> Output 6. Incorrect (Expected 0).
*   Pos (1,3): {6,6,0,6,6}. Only 6&0? Yes. 6 present? Yes. -> Output 6. Correct.
*   Pos (1,4): {6,0,6,6,0}. Only 6&0? Yes. 6 present? Yes. -> Output 6. Incorrect (Expected 0).
*   Pos (2,1): {0,6,0,6,0}. Only 6&0? Yes. 6 present? Yes. -> Output 6. Correct.
*   Pos (2,2): {6,6,6,6,0}. Only 6&0? Yes. 6 present? Yes. -> Output 6. Correct.
*   Pos (2,3): {6,6,6,6,6}. Only 6&0? Yes. 6 present? Yes. -> Output 6. Correct.
*   Pos (2,4): {0,6,6,6,6}. Only 6&0? Yes. 6 present? Yes. -> Output 6. Correct.
*   Pos (3,1): {6,6,0,6,0}. Only 6&0? Yes. 6 present? Yes. -> Output 6. Incorrect (Expected 0).
*   Pos (3,4): {6,6,0,0,0}. Only 6&0? Yes. 6 present? Yes. -> Output 6. Correct.

This rule correctly predicts the dominant color pixels but fails on the white pixels.

It seems the true rule is a combination or modification.

What if we check consistency *ignoring white*?
**Revised Combination Rule v8 (Consistency Ignoring White):** For each position (r, c):
1.  Identify all 5x5 subgrids.
2.  Examine the colors {c1, c2, ... cn} at position (r, c) in all identified blocks.
3.  Filter out any white (0) pixels to get the set of non-white colors {nw1, nw2, ... nwk}.
4.  If the set of non-white colors is empty (i.e., all blocks had white at this position), the output is white (0).
5.  If the set of non-white colors contains *exactly one unique color* (e.g., all non-white pixels were magenta 6), the output is that unique non-white color.
6.  If the set of non-white colors contains *more than one unique color* (e.g., some blocks had red, others had blue), the output is white (0).

Let's test v8 on Example 1 (Dominant=6):
*   Pos (1,1): Colors {6,6,6,6,6}. Non-white {6,6,6,6,6}. Unique non-white: {6}. Output: 6. Correct.
*   Pos (1,2): Colors {6,0,0,6,6}. Non-white {6,6,6}. Unique non-white: {6}. Output: 6. Incorrect (Expected 0).
*   Pos (1,3): Colors {6,6,0,6,6}. Non-white {6,6,6,6}. Unique non-white: {6}. Output: 6. Correct.
*   Pos (1,4): Colors {6,0,6,6,0}. Non-white {6,6,6}. Unique non-white: {6}. Output: 6. Incorrect (Expected 0).

This rule is *identical* to v6 ("union"). Still wrong.

What is different about the positions where the output *should* be white despite the dominant color being present?
Pos (1,2): {6, 0, 0, 6, 6} -> Expected 0.
Pos (1,4): {6, 0, 6, 6, 0} -> Expected 0.
Pos (3,1): {6, 6, 0, 6, 0} -> Expected 0.

What about the positions where the output *should* be dominant color despite white being present?
Pos (1,3): {6, 6, 0, 6, 6} -> Expected 6.
Pos (2,1): {0, 6, 0, 6, 0} -> Expected 6.
Pos (2,2): {6, 6, 6, 6, 0} -> Expected 6.
Pos (2,4): {0, 6, 6, 6, 6} -> Expected 6.
Pos (3,4): {6, 6, 0, 0, 0} -> Expected 6.

Is it about the number of times white appears?
White output: 2 zeros, 2 zeros, 2 zeros.
Dominant output: 1 zero, 3 zeros, 1 zero, 1 zero, 3 zeros.

Maybe: If the mix is only dominant (D) and white (0), output is D *unless* white appears >= N times? What is N?
If N=2:
Pos (1,2): 2 zeros. Output 0. Correct.
Pos (1,4): 2 zeros. Output 0. Correct.
Pos (3,1):
