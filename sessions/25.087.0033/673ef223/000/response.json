            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of pixels with different colors. The background is white (0).\n2.  **Key Colors:** The active colors involved in the transformation are red (2), azure (8), and yellow (4). White (0) serves as the background and remains mostly unchanged, except where overwritten.\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   **Red Lines:** Red pixels (2) consistently appear as vertical line segments, typically along the left or right edges of the grid. These red pixels seem to act as boundaries or starting points for the transformation. They persist unchanged in the output.\n    *   **Azure Seeds:** Azure pixels (8) appear sparsely in the input grid, always located in rows that also contain at least one red pixel. These seem to act as target points or \"seeds\".\n    *   **Azure Fills:** In the output grid, horizontal lines of azure pixels (8) appear. These lines originate or are bounded by the red pixels.\n    *   **Yellow Markers:** Yellow pixels (4) appear only in the output, replacing the original position of an azure \"seed\" pixel when a fill operation reaches it.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation seems to involve drawing horizontal lines of azure (8) based on the positions of red (2) and azure (8) pixels within the same row.\n    *   **Rule 1 (Red + Azure):** If a row contains both red pixel(s) and azure pixel(s), a horizontal azure line is drawn. The line appears to fill the space *between* a red pixel and an azure pixel. The pixel at the original azure location is then changed to yellow (4). The examples suggest the fill originates from the side of the red pixel and extends towards the azure pixel, stopping just before it, and then replacing the azure pixel's spot with yellow. If multiple reds exist, the closest one to the azure pixel seems to be used as the boundary.\n    *   **Rule 2 (Red Only):** If a row contains red pixel(s) but no azure pixels, the entire row (excluding the position(s) of the red pixel(s)) is filled with azure (8). The fill extends across the row, bounded by the grid edges and the red pixel(s).\n    *   **Other Rows:** Rows containing no red pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
