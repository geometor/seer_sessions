Identify the locations of all red (2) pixels and green (3) pixels present in the input grid.\n3. For every identified red and green pixel location, change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).\n4. Count the number of green pixels found in the input grid.\n5. If exactly one green pixel was found at location (row_g, col_g):\n    a. Check if any red pixel identified in step 2 shares the same row `row_g`. Set `found_red_same_row` accordingly (True/False).\n    b. Check if any red pixel identified in step 2 shares the same column `col_g`. Set `found_red_same_col` accordingly (True/False).\n    c. Identify all locations `(r, c)` of azure (8) pixels in the *input* grid.\n    d. If `found_red_same_row` is True AND `found_red_same_col` is False:\n        i. For each input azure pixel location `(r, c)`, calculate the horizontally reflected column `c_reflected = 2 * col_g - c`.\n        ii. If the reflected coordinate `(r, c_reflected)` is within the bounds of the grid, set the pixel at `output[r][c_reflected]` to azure (8).\n    e. Else if `found_red_same_row` is False AND `found_red_same_col` is False:\n        i. For each input azure pixel location `(r, c)`:\n            1. Calculate horizontal reflection: `c_h = 2 * col_g - c`. If `(r, c_h)` is within bounds, set `output[r][c_h] = 8`.\n            2. Calculate vertical reflection: `r_v = 2 * row_g - r`. If `(r_v, c)` is within bounds, set `output[r_v][c] = 8`.\n            3. Calculate diagonal reflection: If `(r_v, c_h)` is within bounds, set `output[r_v][c_h] = 8`.\n    f. Else (if `found_red_same_col` is True, regardless of `found_red_same_row`): No reflection is performed.\n6.
