Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

### Perception

The input grids consist of a white background (color 0) with one or more solid rectangular blocks of various non-white colors (red, blue, green). The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, but the interior pixels of these rectangular blocks have been changed to a different color, specifically azure (color 8). The pixels forming the outer border of each rectangular block retain their original color. Blocks that are only 1 or 2 pixels wide or high do not appear to have their interiors changed, suggesting the transformation only affects blocks large enough to have a distinct 'inside' separate from their border.

### Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - role: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
  - role: object
    type: rectangle
    properties:
      color: non-white (e.g., red(2), blue(1), green(3))
      shape: solid rectangle
      location: defined by bounding box (top-left, bottom-right coordinates)
      size: defined by height and width
  - role: modified_pixel
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      location: interior of a rectangular object

actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    description: Find all distinct, contiguous, rectangular blocks of non-white pixels.
  - name: determine_properties
    description: For each block, find its color, bounding box, height, and width.
  - name: identify_interior
    description: >
      For each block with height > 2 and width > 2, identify the pixels
      that are not part of its 1-pixel thick border. These form the 'inner core'.
  - name: modify_interior
    description: >
      Change the color of all identified interior pixels (the 'inner core')
      to azure (8).

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: >
      Rectangular objects are placed upon the background.
  - type: transformation
    description: >
      The transformation targets the interior pixels of sufficiently large
      rectangular objects, changing their color while leaving the object's
      border and the background unchanged. The new color (azure) is constant
      regardless of the original object's color.
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all separate, contiguous, rectangular blocks composed of a single non-white color.
3.  For each identified rectangular block:
    a.  Determine its bounding box coordinates: top row (`r_min`), bottom row (`r_max`), leftmost column (`c_min`), and rightmost column (`c_max`).
    b.  Calculate the block's height (`H = r_max - r_min + 1`) and width (`W = c_max - c_min + 1`).
    c.  Check if the block has an interior core, which requires `H > 2` and `W > 2`.
    d.  If an interior core exists:
        i.  Iterate through each row `r` from `r_min + 1` up to `r_max - 1`.
        ii. Iterate through each column `c` from `c_min + 1` up to `c_max - 1`.
        iii. In the output grid, set the color of the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) to azure (8).
4.  Return the final modified output grid.
