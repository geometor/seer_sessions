The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, but the interior pixels of these rectangular blocks have been changed to a different color, specifically azure (color 8). The pixels forming the outer border of each rectangular block retain their original color. Blocks that are only 1 or 2 pixels wide or high do not appear to have their interiors changed, suggesting the transformation only affects blocks large enough to have a distinct 'inside' separate from their border.\n\n### Facts\n\n"

Scan the input grid to identify all separate, contiguous, rectangular blocks composed of a single non-white color.\n3.  For each identified rectangular block:\n    a.  Determine its bounding box coordinates: top row (`r_min`), bottom row (`r_max`), leftmost column (`c_min`), and rightmost column (`c_max`).\n    b.  Calculate the block's height (`H = r_max - r_min + 1`) and width (`W = c_max - c_min + 1`).\n    c.  Check if the block has an interior core, which requires `H > 2` and `W > 2`.\n    d.  If an interior core exists:\n        i.  Iterate through each row `r` from `r_min + 1` up to `r_max - 1`.\n        ii. Iterate through each column `c` from `c_min + 1` up to `c_max - 1`.\n        iii. In the output grid, set the color of the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) to azure (8).\n4.  Return the final modified output grid."
