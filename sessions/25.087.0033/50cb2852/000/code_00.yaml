elements:
  - role: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
  - role: object
    type: rectangle
    properties:
      color: non-white (e.g., red(2), blue(1), green(3))
      shape: solid rectangle
      location: defined by bounding box (top-left, bottom-right coordinates)
      size: defined by height and width
  - role: modified_pixel
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      location: interior of a rectangular object

actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    description: Find all distinct, contiguous, rectangular blocks of non-white pixels.
  - name: determine_properties
    description: For each block, find its color, bounding box, height, and width.
  - name: identify_interior
    description: >
      For each block with height > 2 and width > 2, identify the pixels
      that are not part of its 1-pixel thick border. These form the 'inner core'.
  - name: modify_interior
    description: >
      Change the color of all identified interior pixels (the 'inner core')
      to azure (8).

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: >
      Rectangular objects are placed upon the background.
  - type: transformation
    description: >
      The transformation targets the interior pixels of sufficiently large
      rectangular objects, changing their color while leaving the object's
      border and the background unchanged. The new color (azure) is constant
      regardless of the original object's color.
