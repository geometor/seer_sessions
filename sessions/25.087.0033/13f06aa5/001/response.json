Identify the Trigger Pixel: Scan the input grid to find the pixel whose color \n   `C` appears exactly once, excluding the most frequent (background) color. \n   Record its color `C` and location (row `r`, column `c`).\n2. Initialize Output Grid: Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the \n   input grid, initially copying all pixel values from the input.\n3. Apply Row Modification: In the output grid, modify row `r`:\n   - Change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` to `C`.\n   - For `i = 2, 4, 6, ...`:\n     - If column `c - i` is within the grid boundaries, change the pixel at \n       `(r, c - i)` to `C`.\n     - If column `c + i` is within the grid boundaries, change the pixel at \n       `(r, c + i)` to `C`.\n4. Apply Border Modifications: Based on the trigger color `C`:\n   - If `C` is Azure (8):\n     - Set all pixels in the rightmost column (column `width - 1`) to Azure (8).\n     - Set all pixels in the top row (row 0) to Blue (1).\n     - Set the pixel at the top-right corner (`(0, width - 1)`) to White (0).\n   - Else if `C` is Red (2):\n     - Set all pixels in the leftmost column (column 0) to Red (2).\n     - Set all pixels in the top row (row 0) to Green (3).\n     - Set the pixel at the top-left corner (`(0, 0)`) to White (0).\n   - Else if `C` is Magenta (6):\n     - Set all pixels in the bottommost row (row `height - 1`) to Magenta (6).\n5.
