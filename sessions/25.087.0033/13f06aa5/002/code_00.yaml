task_description: Modifies a grid based on a uniquely occurring 'trigger' pixel (Azure, Red, or Magenta) and applies color-specific propagation patterns and border modifications.

definitions:
  background_color: The color that appears most frequently in the input grid.
  trigger_pixel: The single pixel in the input grid that meets these criteria:
    1. Its color (C) is not the background_color.
    2. Its color (C) occurs exactly once in the entire grid.
    3. Its color (C) is one of Azure (8), Red (2), or Magenta (6).
  trigger_color: The color (C) of the trigger_pixel.
  trigger_location: The (row, column) coordinates (r, c) of the trigger_pixel.

transformations:
  - action: initialize_output
    description: Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - action: conditional_propagation
    conditions:
      - trigger_color == Azure (8)
      - trigger_color == Red (2)
    description: |
      Apply horizontal propagation from the trigger_location (r, c) with the trigger_color (C).
      Rightward Propagation: For i = 2, 4, 6...
        - Check column c+i. If it is within grid bounds AND the pixel at (r, c+i-1) is the background_color:
            Set output pixel (r, c+i) to C.
        - Else: Stop rightward propagation.
      Leftward Propagation: For i = 2, 4, 6...
        - Check column c-i. If it is within grid bounds AND the pixel at (r, c-i+1) is the background_color:
            Set output pixel (r, c-i) to C.
        - Else: Stop leftward propagation.
  - action: conditional_propagation
    conditions:
      - trigger_color == Magenta (6)
    description: |
      Apply vertical (downward) propagation from the trigger_location (r, c) with the trigger_color (C).
      Downward Propagation: For i = 2, 4, 6...
        - Check row r+i. If it is within grid bounds AND the pixel at (r+i-1, c) is the background_color:
            Set output pixel (r+i, c) to C.
        - Else: Stop downward propagation.
  - action: border_modification
    conditions:
      - trigger_color == Azure (8)
    description: |
      - Set all pixels in the rightmost column (column width-1) to Azure (8).
      - Set all pixels in the top row (row 0) to Blue (1).
      - Set the pixel at the top-right corner (0, width-1) to White (0).
  - action: border_modification
    conditions:
      - trigger_color == Red (2)
    description: |
      - Set all pixels in the leftmost column (column 0) to Red (2).
      - Set all pixels in the top row (row 0) to Green (3).
      - Set the pixel at the top-left corner (0, 0) to White (0).
  - action: border_modification
    conditions:
      - trigger_color == Magenta (6)
    description: |
      - Set all pixels in the bottommost row (row height-1) to Magenta (6).

output: The modified grid.
