The background color remains largely unchanged in the output, except for specific modifications.\n3.  **Trigger Pixel:** In each input grid, there appears to be a single pixel of a specific color that acts as a trigger for the transformation. This color is unique in the grid (excluding the background).\n    *   Ex1: Azure (8) at (8, 4).\n    *   Ex2: Red (2) at (5, 3). (Green (3) is also unique, but Red drives the main pattern change).\n    *   Ex3: Magenta (6) at (2, 5).\n4.  **Row/Column Modification:** The row containing the trigger pixel is modified in the output. Starting from the trigger pixel's column, pixels at every second column index (including the trigger's column, and extending both left and right within the grid bounds) are changed to the trigger pixel's color.\n5.  **Border Modifications:** The borders of the grid (top, bottom, left, right rows/columns) are modified based on the *color* of the trigger pixel.\n    *   If Trigger is Azure (8): Top row becomes Blue (1), Right column becomes Azure (8), Top-Right corner becomes White (0).\n    *   If Trigger is Red (2): Top row becomes Green (3), Left column becomes Red (2), Top-Left corner becomes White (0).\n    *   If Trigger is Magenta (6): Bottom row becomes Magenta (6). No other borders change, no corner changes.\n6.  **Overlap/Priority:** The border modifications overwrite any previous changes (including the row modification) in the affected border cells.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
