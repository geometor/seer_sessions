Okay, let's analyze the examples provided for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Size:** The grid dimensions remain the same between the input and output in all examples.
    *   Example 1: 12x14 -> 12x14
    *   Example 2: 11x13 -> 11x13
    *   Example 3: 15x12 -> 15x12
2.  **Background Color:** Each input grid has a dominant background color (Red-2 in Ex1, Blue-1 in Ex2, Green-3 in Ex3). The background color remains largely unchanged in the output, except for specific modifications.
3.  **Trigger Pixel:** In each input grid, there appears to be a single pixel of a specific color that acts as a trigger for the transformation. This color is unique in the grid (excluding the background).
    *   Ex1: Azure (8) at (8, 4).
    *   Ex2: Red (2) at (5, 3). (Green (3) is also unique, but Red drives the main pattern change).
    *   Ex3: Magenta (6) at (2, 5).
4.  **Row/Column Modification:** The row containing the trigger pixel is modified in the output. Starting from the trigger pixel's column, pixels at every second column index (including the trigger's column, and extending both left and right within the grid bounds) are changed to the trigger pixel's color.
5.  **Border Modifications:** The borders of the grid (top, bottom, left, right rows/columns) are modified based on the *color* of the trigger pixel.
    *   If Trigger is Azure (8): Top row becomes Blue (1), Right column becomes Azure (8), Top-Right corner becomes White (0).
    *   If Trigger is Red (2): Top row becomes Green (3), Left column becomes Red (2), Top-Left corner becomes White (0).
    *   If Trigger is Magenta (6): Bottom row becomes Magenta (6). No other borders change, no corner changes.
6.  **Overlap/Priority:** The border modifications overwrite any previous changes (including the row modification) in the affected border cells.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    - background_color: Each input has a dominant background color, which mostly persists in the output.
  objects:
    - trigger_pixel:
        - definition: A single pixel in the input grid whose color is unique (excluding the background color). This pixel's properties drive the transformation.
        - properties:
            - color: The specific color of the trigger pixel (e.g., Azure-8, Red-2, Magenta-6).
            - location: The row and column index (r, c) of the trigger pixel.
        - identification_rule: (Tentative) Find the color C that appears exactly once in the input grid (excluding the background color). If multiple such colors exist, select the one whose location (r, c), when used in the modification rule, produces the observed output pattern.
  actions:
    - copy_grid: The output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid.
    - modify_row_pattern:
        - target_row: The row 'r' corresponding to the trigger pixel's location.
        - pattern: Apply changes to pixels at column indices `c, c-2, c+2, c-4, c+4, ...` within the row's bounds.
        - color_change: The affected pixels in the target row are changed to the trigger pixel's color 'C'.
    - modify_borders:
        - condition: Based on the trigger pixel's color 'C'.
        - rules:
            - if C == Azure (8):
                - set_right_column: Azure (8)
                - set_top_row: Blue (1)
                - set_pixel(0, last_col): White (0)
            - if C == Red (2):
                - set_left_column: Red (2)
                - set_top_row: Green (3)
                - set_pixel(0, 0): White (0)
            - if C == Magenta (6):
                - set_bottom_row: Magenta (6)
        - priority: Border modifications overwrite any previous changes in the border cells.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Trigger Pixel:** Scan the input grid to find the pixel whose color `C` appears exactly once, excluding the most frequent (background) color. Record its color `C` and location (row `r`, column `c`).
2.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially copying all pixel values from the input.
3.  **Apply Row Modification:** In the output grid, modify row `r`:
    *   Change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` to `C`.
    *   For `i = 2, 4, 6, ...`:
        *   If column `c - i` is within the grid boundaries, change the pixel at `(r, c - i)` to `C`.
        *   If column `c + i` is within the grid boundaries, change the pixel at `(r, c + i)` to `C`.
4.  **Apply Border Modifications:** Based on the trigger color `C`:
    *   **If `C` is Azure (8):**
        *   Set all pixels in the rightmost column (column `width - 1`) to Azure (8).
        *   Set all pixels in the top row (row 0) to Blue (1).
        *   Set the pixel at the top-right corner (`(0, width - 1)`) to White (0).
    *   **Else if `C` is Red (2):**
        *   Set all pixels in the leftmost column (column 0) to Red (2).
        *   Set all pixels in the top row (row 0) to Green (3).
        *   Set the pixel at the top-left corner (`(0, 0)`) to White (0).
    *   **Else if `C` is Magenta (6):**
        *   Set all pixels in the bottommost row (row `height - 1`) to Magenta (6).
5.  **Return the modified output grid.**
