Confirmed.\n*   **Example 2:** Azure (8) count is 178, Yellow (4) is 56, Magenta (6) is 51. Azure (8) is the most frequent. Magenta (6) is replaced by Azure (8). Confirmed.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:** The transformation identifies the most frequent color in the input grid. It then replaces all instances of the magenta (6) color with this most frequent color. All other pixels remain unchanged.\n\nThis seems robust and covers both examples.\n\n**Structuring the Response:**\n\n*   **Perception:** Describe the input/output grids, the colors involved, the apparent role of magenta, and the replacement mechanism using the most frequent color.\n*   **Facts:**\n    *   Identify grid dimensions.\n    *   List present colors in input/output.\n    *   Identify the color to be replaced (magenta, 6).\n    *   Identify the replacement color logic (most frequent color).\n    *   State that other colors remain unchanged.\n*   **Natural Language Program:** Step-by-step instructions based on the revised hypothesis.Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both examples show an input grid and an output grid of the same dimensions.\n2.  **Color Palette:**\n    *   Example 1 uses orange (7), magenta (6), and azure (8).\n    *   Example 2 uses azure (8), yellow (4), and magenta (6).\n3.  **Transformation Observation:** In both examples, the key change is the disappearance of magenta (6) pixels from the input grid.\n4.  **Replacement Pattern:**\n    *   In example 1, the magenta (6) pixels are replaced by orange (7) pixels. Orange (7) is the most common color in the input grid.\n    *   In example 2, the magenta (6) pixels are replaced by azure (8) pixels. Azure (8) is the most common color in the input grid.\n5.  **Invariant Pixels:** Pixels that are *not* magenta (6) in the input grid appear to retain their original color and position in the output grid.\n6.  **Hypothesis:** The core transformation seems to be: Identify the most frequent color in the entire input grid. Then, replace every instance of the magenta (6) color with that most frequent color. Leave all other pixels as they are.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
