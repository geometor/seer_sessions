Requires `len(P_horiz) > 1`.\n  - If the intersection is at the end of `P_horiz` (`idx_h == len(P_horiz) - 1`), `S_c` is `P_horiz` cyclically shifted left by one.\nCreates an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color (0).\nFills the entire intersection row `r` by repeating the sequence `S_r`.\nFills the entire intersection column `c` by repeating the sequence `S_c`.
