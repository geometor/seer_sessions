"""
Identifies an intersection point of a horizontal and a vertical segment of non-background (non-zero) pixels in the input grid.
Extracts the sequence of colors from the maximal contiguous horizontal segment (`P_horiz`) passing through the intersection.
Extracts the sequence of colors from the maximal contiguous vertical segment (`P_vert`) passing through the intersection.
Determines the index (`idx_h`) of the intersection color within `P_horiz` and the index (`idx_v`) within `P_vert`.
Derives two new sequences, `S_r` and `S_c`, based on `P_horiz`, `P_vert`, `idx_h`, and `idx_v`.
- Sequence `S_r` for filling the intersection row `r` depends on `P_horiz` and `idx_h`:
  - If the intersection is at the start of `P_horiz` (`idx_h == 0`), `S_r` is `P_horiz` cyclically shifted left by one.
  - If the intersection is at the end of `P_horiz` (`idx_h == len(P_horiz) - 1`), `S_r` is `P_horiz` itself.
- Sequence `S_c` for filling the intersection column `c` also depends on `P_horiz` and `idx_h` (and potentially `P_vert`, `idx_v`):
  - If the intersection is at the start of `P_horiz` (`idx_h == 0`), `S_c` is formed by concatenating the part of `P_vert` before the intersection (`P_vert[:idx_v]`), the color immediately following the intersection in `P_horiz` (`P_horiz[idx_h+1]`), and the intersection color itself (`P_horiz[idx_h]`). Requires `len(P_horiz) > 1`.
  - If the intersection is at the end of `P_horiz` (`idx_h == len(P_horiz) - 1`), `S_c` is `P_horiz` cyclically shifted left by one.
Creates an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color (0).
Fills the entire intersection row `r` by repeating the sequence `S_r`.
Fills the entire intersection column `c` by repeating the sequence `S_c`. The value at the intersection `(r, c)` will be determined by the column fill `S_c`.
