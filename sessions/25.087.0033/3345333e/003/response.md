"""
Identifies all contiguous non-background objects in the input grid. 
Counts the number of distinct objects for each color.
Determines if each object is a 'solid rectangle' (its shape perfectly fills its bounding box).
Finds if there is exactly one object that is both a solid rectangle AND the only object of its color.
If such an object exists, it is removed by changing its pixels to the background color (white, 0).
Otherwise, the grid remains unchanged.
