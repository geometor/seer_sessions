"""
Identifies all contiguous non-background objects in the input grid.
For each object, determines if it forms a 'solid rectangle' - meaning its shape perfectly fills its bounding box.
Removes all objects identified as solid rectangles by changing their pixels to the background color (white, 0).
Other objects and the background remain unchanged.
