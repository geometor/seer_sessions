task_context:
  description: Remove specific solid rectangular objects based on color uniqueness.
  input_output_relation: Selective removal based on object properties.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  value_range: 0-9 (colors)
  background_color: 0 (white)

object_definitions:
  - type: Contiguous block of same non-background color pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The integer value (1-9) of the pixels.
      - coordinates: Set of (row, col) tuples comprising the object.
      - bounding_box: Minimum rectangle enclosing all object coordinates.
      - is_solid_rectangle: Boolean, true if the object's coordinates perfectly fill its bounding box.

transformation_steps:
  - action: Identify Objects
    description: Find all contiguous objects of non-background colors in the input grid.
    inputs: Input grid.
    outputs: List of objects, each with color and coordinates.
  - action: Analyze Object Properties
    description: For each object, determine if it is a solid rectangle.
    inputs: List of objects.
    outputs: List of objects with added 'is_solid_rectangle' property.
  - action: Count Objects per Color
    description: Count how many distinct objects exist for each color present in the grid.
    inputs: List of objects.
    outputs: Mapping from color to object count.
  - action: Identify Target Object for Removal
    description: >
      Find the object that satisfies both conditions:
      1. It is a solid rectangle.
      2. It is the *only* object of its specific color in the grid.
    inputs: List of objects with properties, Color counts.
    outputs: The coordinates of the target object (if found), otherwise none.
  - action: Apply Transformation
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input grid and setting the pixels corresponding to the identified target object's coordinates to the background color (0). If no target object was identified, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
    inputs: Input grid, Coordinates of target object (or none).
    outputs: Output grid.

constraints_and_observations:
  - Only *one* such object (unique color + solid rectangle) is removed per grid, even if multiple colors meet the criteria (though not observed in examples). Assumed only zero or one such object exists per task constraints.
  - Objects that are solid rectangles but share their color with other objects are *not* removed.
  - Objects that are unique in color but *not* solid rectangles are *not* removed.
  - The background color is white (0).
