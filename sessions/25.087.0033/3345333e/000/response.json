The grid size remains constant between input and output (16x16 in both examples).\n2.  **Content**: The grids contain a background color (white, 0) and several distinct colored \"objects\" (contiguous areas of non-white color).\n3.  **Example 1 (train_1)**:\n    *   Input: Contains a green (3) solid square and a red (2) hollow/complex shape.\n    *   Output: Contains only the red (2) shape. The green (3) square has been removed (replaced with white).\n4.  **Example 2 (train_2)**:\n    *   Input: Contains a magenta (6) complex shape and a blue (1) solid rectangle.\n    *   Output: Contains only the magenta (6) shape. The blue (1) rectangle has been removed (replaced with white).\n5.  **Observed Transformation**: In both examples, one colored object is completely removed from the grid, while the other objects and the background remain unchanged.\n6.  **Pattern**: The object that gets removed in both examples appears to be a \"solid\" rectangle (a rectangular block where all pixels within its bounding box share the same color). The objects that remain are \"hollow\" or have more complex shapes, not forming solid rectangles.\n7.  **Inferred Goal**: The task seems to be to identify and remove any object that forms a solid rectangle, replacing its pixels with the background color (white).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
