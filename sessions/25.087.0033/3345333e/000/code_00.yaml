task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_constant: true
    - background_color: white (0)
  objects:
    - type: background
      color: white (0)
    - type: colored_shape
      properties:
        - color: non-zero integer (e.g., red, green, blue, magenta)
        - contiguity: pixels of the same color are connected
        - shape: can be solid or complex/hollow
actions:
  - identify_objects: Find all contiguous blocks of non-background colors.
  - analyze_shape: For each object, determine if it forms a solid rectangle.
      - definition: A solid rectangle is an object where its bounding box contains only pixels of the object's color.
  - filter_objects: Select the object(s) that are solid rectangles.
  - modify_grid:
      - target: Pixels belonging to the selected solid rectangle object(s).
      - change: Replace their color with the background color (white, 0).
relationships:
  - object_vs_background: Objects are distinct from the background.
  - solid_vs_non_solid: Objects can be categorized based on whether they fill their bounding box completely.
  - transformation_target: Only solid rectangle objects are targeted for removal.
examples:
  - train_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: green (3), shape: solid 4x4 square
        - color: red (2), shape: complex/hollow
      output_objects:
        - color: red (2), shape: complex/hollow
      removed_object_color: green (3)
  - train_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: magenta (6), shape: complex/hollow
        - color: blue (1), shape: solid 4x4 rectangle
      output_objects:
        - color: magenta (6), shape: complex/hollow
      removed_object_color: blue (1)
