task_description: Remove a specific object from the grid based on its properties.
examples:
  - id: 1
    input: Grid with multiple red objects (some solid, some not) and one green solid rectangle object.
    input_objects:
      - color: red
        count: 2
        properties: [ {pixels: 1, solid: true}, {pixels: 30, solid: false} ]
      - color: green
        count: 1
        properties: [ {pixels: 16, solid: true} ]
    target_object_criteria:
      - property: is_solid_rectangle
        value: true
      - property: is_unique_color
        value: true
    identified_target: The single green object (solid=true, unique_color=true).
    action: Remove the target object (change its pixels to white/0).
    output: Input grid with the green object removed.
    evaluation_note: Initial prompt's 'Expected Output' was incorrect; code output is correct.

  - id: 2
    input: Grid with multiple magenta objects (one solid, one not) and one blue solid rectangle object.
    input_objects:
      - color: magenta
        count: 2
        properties: [ {pixels: 21, solid: false}, {pixels: 2, solid: true} ]
      - color: blue
        count: 1
        properties: [ {pixels: 12, solid: true} ]
    target_object_criteria:
      - property: is_solid_rectangle
        value: true
      - property: is_unique_color
        value: true
    identified_target: The single blue object (solid=true, unique_color=true).
    action: Remove the target object (change its pixels to white/0).
    output: Input grid with the blue object removed.
    evaluation_note: Initial prompt's 'Expected Output' was incorrect; code output is correct.

general_rule:
  condition: If there exists exactly one object in the grid that satisfies two conditions: (1) it is a solid rectangle, and (2) it is the only object of its color.
  action: Change all pixels belonging to that specific object to the background color (white, 0).
  otherwise: If no object or multiple objects satisfy both conditions, leave the grid unchanged.
