"""
Identifies all contiguous non-background objects in the input grid. 
For each object, determines if it's a solid rectangle and if it's the only object of its color.
If exactly one object satisfies both conditions (is a solid rectangle AND is the unique object of its color), 
that object is removed by changing its pixels to the background color (white, 0).
Otherwise, the grid remains unchanged.
