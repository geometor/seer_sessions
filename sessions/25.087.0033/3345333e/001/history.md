Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure**: Both input and output are grids of pixels represented by integers (colors). The grid size remains constant between input and output (16x16 in both examples).
2.  **Content**: The grids contain a background color (white, 0) and several distinct colored "objects" (contiguous areas of non-white color).
3.  **Example 1 (train_1)**:
    *   Input: Contains a green (3) solid square and a red (2) hollow/complex shape.
    *   Output: Contains only the red (2) shape. The green (3) square has been removed (replaced with white).
4.  **Example 2 (train_2)**:
    *   Input: Contains a magenta (6) complex shape and a blue (1) solid rectangle.
    *   Output: Contains only the magenta (6) shape. The blue (1) rectangle has been removed (replaced with white).
5.  **Observed Transformation**: In both examples, one colored object is completely removed from the grid, while the other objects and the background remain unchanged.
6.  **Pattern**: The object that gets removed in both examples appears to be a "solid" rectangle (a rectangular block where all pixels within its bounding box share the same color). The objects that remain are "hollow" or have more complex shapes, not forming solid rectangles.
7.  **Inferred Goal**: The task seems to be to identify and remove any object that forms a solid rectangle, replacing its pixels with the background color (white).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_constant: true
    - background_color: white (0)
  objects:
    - type: background
      color: white (0)
    - type: colored_shape
      properties:
        - color: non-zero integer (e.g., red, green, blue, magenta)
        - contiguity: pixels of the same color are connected
        - shape: can be solid or complex/hollow
actions:
  - identify_objects: Find all contiguous blocks of non-background colors.
  - analyze_shape: For each object, determine if it forms a solid rectangle.
      - definition: A solid rectangle is an object where its bounding box contains only pixels of the object's color.
  - filter_objects: Select the object(s) that are solid rectangles.
  - modify_grid:
      - target: Pixels belonging to the selected solid rectangle object(s).
      - change: Replace their color with the background color (white, 0).
relationships:
  - object_vs_background: Objects are distinct from the background.
  - solid_vs_non_solid: Objects can be categorized based on whether they fill their bounding box completely.
  - transformation_target: Only solid rectangle objects are targeted for removal.
examples:
  - train_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: green (3), shape: solid 4x4 square
        - color: red (2), shape: complex/hollow
      output_objects:
        - color: red (2), shape: complex/hollow
      removed_object_color: green (3)
  - train_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: magenta (6), shape: complex/hollow
        - color: blue (1), shape: solid 4x4 rectangle
      output_objects:
        - color: magenta (6), shape: complex/hollow
      removed_object_color: blue (1)

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects in the input grid that are not the background color (white, 0).
3.  For each identified object:
    a.  Determine its color.
    b.  Calculate its bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing the object).
    c.  Count the number of pixels within the bounding box that match the object's color.
    d.  Calculate the total number of pixels within the bounding box (width * height).
    e.  If the count from step 3c equals the total number of pixels from step 3d, classify this object as a "solid rectangle".
4.  Identify the color(s) of all objects classified as "solid rectangles".
5.  Iterate through every pixel of the input grid.
6.  If a pixel's color matches any of the colors identified in step 4 (colors of solid rectangles), change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the background color (white, 0).
7.  Return the modified output grid.
