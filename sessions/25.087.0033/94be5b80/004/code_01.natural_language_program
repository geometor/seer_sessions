1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all connected components (objects) of non-white pixels using 8-neighbor connectivity. Record each object's color, coordinates, and bounding box.
2.  **Separate Potential Palette and Template Objects:**
    a.  Group objects by their shape signature (relative coordinates).
    b.  Hypothesize potential template signatures: Identify signatures that appear more than once.
    c.  Hypothesize potential palette objects: Identify objects that do *not* match any of the potential template signatures.
    d.  Refine Palette Identification: Analyze the spatial arrangement and properties of the potential palette objects. Look for a cluster of these objects forming a compact (often rectangular) region containing multiple distinct colors. Define the set of pixels belonging to this confirmed palette region.
    e.  Refine Template Identification: Confirm the template objects as those *not* part of the confirmed palette region. Identify the most frequent shape signature among these confirmed template objects. This is the `Template Signature`. Record its height (`H`) and width (`W`). Store the objects matching this signature as `Template Objects`.
3.  **Extract Palette Colors:**
    a.  Find the minimal bounding box enclosing all pixels of the confirmed palette region.
    b.  Determine the orientation: Horizontal if width >= height, Vertical otherwise.
    c.  Extract the ordered, unique `Palette Colors`:
        *   **Horizontal:** Scan columns left-to-right within the palette bounding box. For each column, find the top-most palette pixel and add its color to the list if not already present.
        *   **Vertical:** Scan rows top-to-bottom within the palette bounding box. For each row, find the left-most palette pixel and add its color to the list if not already present.
4.  **Identify Anchor Template:** Among the `Template Objects`, find the one with the minimum starting row (top-most). Record its starting row (`min_orig_row`), starting column (`colS` - the left-most column of its bbox), and color (`anchor_color`).
5.  **Find Anchor Index:** Determine the 0-based index (`k`) of `anchor_color` within the ordered `Palette Colors` list. If not found, default to `k=0` (or handle as an error).
6.  **Calculate Output Stack Start Row:** Compute the starting row (`R_start`) for the stacked output shapes: `R_start = min_orig_row - (k * H)`.
7.  **Generate Output Grid:** Create a new grid initialized with the background color (white, 0). Iterate through the `Palette Colors` list with index `i` and color `ci`:
    a.  Calculate the top row for this instance: `current_row = R_start + (i * H)`.
    b.  Draw the template shape (using `Template Signature` relative coordinates `dr, dc`) onto the output grid at position (`current_row`, `colS`) using color `ci`. For each `(dr, dc)`, set the pixel at `(current_row + dr, colS + dc)` to `ci`, respecting grid boundaries.
8.  Return the generated output grid.
