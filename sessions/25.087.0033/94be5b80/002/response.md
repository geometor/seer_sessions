Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.

**General Assessment:**

The provided code fails significantly on both training examples, producing outputs that bear little resemblance to the expected results. The core issues seem to stem from incorrect identification or interpretation of the "palette" and potentially how objects are identified or how the template shape/positioning is handled.

*   **Example 1 Failure:** The output contains only a few red pixels near the top left, whereas the expected output is a vertical stack of 'H' shapes colored according to the horizontal palette. This suggests the palette extraction failed, the template shape wasn't identified correctly, or the positioning calculation was drastically off.
*   **Example 2 Failure:** The output contains only a few blue pixels near the top left. The expected output is a vertical stack of 'arrow' shapes colored according to the vertical palette. Similar issues as Example 1 are likely: palette extraction, template identification, or positioning.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-evaluate Connectivity:** The `find_connected_components` function in the previous attempt had complex logic potentially mixing diagonal and orthogonal checks. ARC tasks typically use orthogonal connectivity unless implied otherwise. Simplify `find_connected_components` to use only 4-neighbor (orthogonal) connectivity.
2.  **Refine Palette Extraction:** The previous logic scanned the bounding box of non-template pixels column-by-column and took the first color. This failed for the vertical palette in Example 2 and possibly the horizontal one in Example 1. A new approach is needed:
    *   Identify template objects (most frequent shape) and non-template objects.
    *   If non-template objects exist, determine their collective bounding box.
    *   Infer the palette orientation (horizontal if width > height, vertical if height > width).
    *   If horizontal, scan columns left-to-right, taking the color of the *top-most* non-white pixel in each column within the palette bounding box.
    *   If vertical, scan rows top-to-bottom, taking the color of the *left-most* non-white pixel in each row within the palette bounding box.
    *   Ensure colors are added uniquely while preserving scan order.
    *   If no non-template objects exist, use the colors of the template objects themselves as the palette, ordered by their top-most row coordinate.
3.  **Verify Template & Anchor Logic:** The logic of using the most frequent shape as the template and the top-most instance of that template as the anchor seems sound but needs to be verified with the corrected connectivity and palette logic.
4.  **Verify Placement Logic:** The formula `R_start = min_orig_row - (k * H)` seems correct conceptually but depends heavily on the accuracy of `min_orig_row` (anchor's top row), `k` (anchor color's index in the *correctly ordered* palette), and `H` (template height).

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's gather some specific data points using code execution to confirm assumptions. We need a robust orthogonal connectivity function first.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Orthogonal Connectivity:** The new `find_connected_components_ortho` identifies objects correctly based on adjacency (e.g., the 'H' shape is broken by orthogonal connectivity, which is wrong!). The previous code's approach was likely trying to handle shapes like the 'H' by looking for diagonal connections. My assumption about strictly orthogonal was incorrect for this task based on Example 1. The 'H' shapes *are* the templates. The vertical bars *are* the palette. The code misidentified the templates because the 'H' shape is not orthogonally connected. Let's revert the connectivity check OR change the template identification logic.
*   **Revised Strategy based on Metrics:**
    1.  **Connectivity:** Go back to a connectivity function that considers diagonal connections (8-neighbors) as defining a single object. This is crucial for the 'H' shape in Example 1 and the 'arrow' in Example 2.
    2.  **Template Identification:** Use the most frequent shape signature found using 8-neighbor connectivity.
    3.  **Palette Extraction:** Identify non-template objects. Determine their collective bounding box. Infer orientation (H vs V). Scan appropriately (L->R for H, T->B for V) taking the first color encountered in each row/column of the bounding box.
    4.  **Anchor/Placement:** Remains the same conceptually.

Let's re-run the metrics with 8-neighbor connectivity.
