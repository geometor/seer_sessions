In the examples, these are 'T' shapes of different sizes.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid contains only the template shapes, potentially including new ones not present in the input. The palette is removed.\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The palette defines a sequence of colors based on their left-to-right order.\n    *   The task identifies the common geometric structure of the template shapes.\n    *   The output grid removes the palette.\n    *   It then constructs a vertical stack of the template shape, using *all* the colors from the palette, ordered according to the palette's sequence.\n    *   The original template shapes are essentially replaced by this new, complete stack.\n    *   The vertical positioning of this stack is determined by aligning one of the shapes in the stack (specifically, the one whose color corresponds to the *top-most* original template shape in the input) with the original position of that top-most shape.\n    *   The horizontal positioning (column) of the stack matches the horizontal position of the original template shapes.\n    *   The shapes in the final stack are placed immediately adjacent vertically (no gap).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Extract the sequence of colors (`P`) from left to right within this region.\n2.  **Identify the Template Shape:** Locate all other non-white objects in the grid. Verify that they share the same geometric shape. Define this common shape as the `Template`. Determine its height (`H`) and the common starting column (`colS`) of these initial instances.\n3.  **Identify the Anchor:** Find the instance of the `Template` in the input grid that has the minimum starting row (`min_orig_row`). Record its color (`anchor_color`).\n4.  **Find Anchor Index in Palette:** Determine the 0-based index (`k`) where `anchor_color` appears in the palette color sequence `P`.\n5.  **Calculate Stack Start Row:** Compute the starting row (`R_start`) for the output stack using the formula: `R_start = min_orig_row - (k * H)`.\n6.  **Generate Output:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with the background color (white). For each color `ci` in the palette sequence `P` at index `i` (from 0 to n-1, where n is the number of colors in P):\n    a.  Calculate the placement row for this shape: `current_row = R_start + (i * H)`.\n    b.  Draw the `Template` shape using color `ci` onto the output grid, starting at position (`current_row`, `colS`).\n7.  Return the generated output grid."
