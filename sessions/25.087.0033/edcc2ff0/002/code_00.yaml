task_context:
  description: Transforms a grid based on object counts below a separator line, modifying both the area above and below the separator.
  grid_properties:
    - height: variable (e.g., 20)
    - width: variable (e.g., 10)
    - colors: 0-9 palette

input_structure:
  separator:
    - type: row
    - property: first row fully composed of a single non-white color (S)
    - location: divides grid into control_section (above) and data_section (separator row and below)
  control_section:
    - location: rows above the separator row
    - features:
        - key_pixels: located at column 0 of each row
        - key_colors (K): set of non-white colors found in key_pixels
  data_section:
    - location: separator row and all rows below it
    - features:
        - contains various colored objects
        - contains the separator color (S)
        - may contain key colors (K)
        - may contain other colors (O) not in K and not S

transformation:
  actions:
    - action: copy_input_to_output
      target: entire grid
    - action: clean_data_section
      target: output grid's data_section (including separator row)
      condition: for each pixel (r, c) in data_section
      rule: |
        pixel_color = output_grid[r, c]
        if pixel_color != separator_color (S) AND pixel_color is not in key_colors (K):
          output_grid[r, c] = separator_color (S)
    - action: process_control_section
      target: output grid's control_section
      condition: for each row (r) in control_section
      rule: |
        key_color = input_grid[r, 0]
        if key_color is not white (0):
          count (N) = number of distinct connected objects (8-way) of key_color in the *cleaned* data_section
          if N > 0:
            line_end = min(N, grid_width)
            output_grid[r, 0:line_end] = key_color
            output_grid[r, line_end:grid_width] = white (0)
          else (N == 0):
            output_grid[r, 0:grid_width] = white (0) # Set entire row to white
        # else (key_color is white): row remains as copied from input (likely mostly white)

output_structure:
  control_section: modified with horizontal lines or cleared to white based on object counts.
  data_section: separator row and below, matching the input data section EXCEPT where non-key, non-separator colors have been replaced by the separator color.
