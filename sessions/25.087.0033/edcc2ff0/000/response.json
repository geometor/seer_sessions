In all examples, this is row 7.\n    *   The top section (rows 0-6) consists mostly of white pixels, with a few isolated non-white pixels located exclusively in the first column (column 0).\n    *   The bottom section (row 7 onwards) contains a background color filling most of the space, with various smaller objects of different colors embedded within it.\n    *   The transformation only affects the top section; the bottom section remains identical between input and output.\n    *   The color of each non-white pixel in the first column of the top section acts as a key.\n    *   The transformation involves counting the number of distinct, connected objects (including diagonal connections) of that key color within the bottom section.\n    *   This count determines the length of a horizontal line drawn in the output grid, starting from the position of the key pixel in the top section.\n    *   The line is drawn using the key color.\n    *   If the count of objects for a key color is zero, the corresponding key pixel in the top section is turned white in the output.\n\n*   **Facts**\n    "
