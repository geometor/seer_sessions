The original logic prioritized cardinal directions (North, South, East, West) based solely on the dominant component of the vector pointing from the pattern center to the magenta pixel. The analysis of all examples revealed a more nuanced rule: a diagonal neighbor is chosen unless the vector is strongly aligned with a cardinal axis (i.e., the ratio of the smaller vector component to the larger one is below a certain threshold). The refined logic, incorporating this ratio check, correctly identifies the neighbor pixel in all three examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe `tool_code` execution provides the following metrics, confirming the analysis:\n\n"

Record the coordinates of the center pixel as (r_s, c_s). If not found, return the grid unchanged.\n3.  **Locate Target 1**: Find the unique magenta (6) pixel in the grid. Record its coordinates as (r_t1, c_t1). If not found, return the grid unchanged.\n4.  **Calculate Vector**: Compute the vector V = (dr, dc) pointing from the source center to Target 1: `dr = r_t1 - r_s`, `dc = c_t1 - c_s`.\n5.  **Determine Neighbor Offset**: Calculate the offset `(dr_n, dc_n)` to find the neighbor pixel relative to the source center (r_s, c_s) based on the vector V:\n    *   If `dr` is 0 and `dc` is 0, the offset is (0, 0).\n    *   If `dr` is 0 (and `dc` is not 0), the offset is (0, sign(dc)).\n    *   If `dc` is 0 (and `dr` is not 0), the offset is (sign(dr), 0).\n    *   If neither `dr` nor `dc` is 0:\n        *   Calculate the ratio `R = min(abs(dr), abs(dc)) / max(abs(dr), abs(dc))`.\n        *   Define a threshold `T = 0.3`.\n        *   If `R < T` (vector is strongly cardinal):\n            *   If `abs(dr) > abs(dc)`, the offset is (sign(dr), 0).\n            *   Otherwise (i.e., `abs(dc) >= abs(dr)`), the offset is (0, sign(dc)).\n        *   If `R >= T` (vector is substantially diagonal or components are equal):\n            *   The offset is (sign(dr), sign(dc)).\n6.  **Calculate Neighbor Coordinates**: Determine the coordinates of the neighbor pixel (Target 2) by adding the offset to the source center coordinates: `(r_n, c_n) = (r_s + dr_n, c_s + dc_n)`.\n7.  **Modify Source**: Change the color of the pixel at the source center coordinates (r_s, c_s) in the output grid from maroon (9) to gray (5).\n8.  **Modify Target 1**: Change the color of the pixel at the Target 1 coordinates (r_t1, c_t1) in the output grid from magenta (6) to maroon (9).\n9.  **Modify Neighbor (Target 2)**: Check if the calculated neighbor coordinates (r_n, c_n) are valid (within the grid boundaries) and different from the source coordinates (r_s, c_s). If valid and different, change the color of the pixel at (r_n, c_n) in the output grid from gray (5) to maroon (9). (Based on examples, this neighbor is always initially gray).\n10. **Return**: Return the modified output grid."
