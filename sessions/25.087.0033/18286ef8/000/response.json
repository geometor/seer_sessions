            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The grids are composed of pixels with different colors (0-9). White pixels (0) often act as separators, dividing the grid into conceptual regions, although not always forming complete boundaries.\n2.  **Key Pattern:** A recurring and significant pattern is a 3x3 square made of gray (5) pixels with a maroon (9) pixel at its exact center. This pattern appears exactly once in each input example.\n3.  **Target Pixel:** In each input grid, there is exactly one magenta (6) pixel located somewhere outside the 3x3 gray/maroon pattern.\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation seems to involve only two specific pixels: the maroon (9) pixel at the center of the gray square and the unique magenta (6) pixel.\n5.  **Observed Change:**\n    *   The maroon (9) pixel within the 3x3 gray square changes to gray (5) in the output.\n    *   The magenta (6) pixel changes to maroon (9) in the output.\n6.  **Invariance:** All other pixels in the grid retain their original colors and positions.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
