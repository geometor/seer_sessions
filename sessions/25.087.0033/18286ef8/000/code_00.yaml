elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels (integers 0-9).
  - object: source_pattern
    description: A 3x3 square pattern.
    properties:
      - border_color: gray (5)
      - center_color: maroon (9)
      - location: Found once per grid.
  - object: source_pixel
    description: The central pixel of the source_pattern.
    properties:
      - color: maroon (9)
      - location: Center of the 3x3 gray square.
  - object: target_pixel
    description: A single pixel within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: magenta (6)
      - count: Exactly one per grid.
      - location: Distinct from the source_pattern pixels.
relationships:
  - The source_pixel is the center element of the source_pattern.
  - The target_pixel is the unique instance of the magenta color in the grid.
actions:
  - action: identify_source
    description: Locate the coordinates of the source_pixel (maroon center of the gray square).
  - action: identify_target
    description: Locate the coordinates of the target_pixel (the unique magenta pixel).
  - action: modify_source_location
    description: Change the color of the pixel at the source_pixel's coordinates to gray (5).
  - action: modify_target_location
    description: Change the color of the pixel at the target_pixel's coordinates to maroon (9).
transformation_rule:
  - The transformation involves relocating the color value (maroon) from the source_pixel to the target_pixel's location, while the source_pixel's location takes on the color gray (5).
