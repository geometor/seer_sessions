    *   Angles (0=East, 90=South, 180=West, 270=North):
        *   Ex1: 51.3 deg (East-South-East). Neighbor changed: South.
        *   Ex2: 194.0 deg (West-South-West). Neighbor changed: West.
        *   Ex3: 203.2 deg (West-South-West). Neighbor changed: North.

    *   This angle approach doesn't clarify Ex3 either. 203 degrees is clearly closer to West than North.

    *   Could the rule be: Determine the quadrant relative to the source. Change the neighbor corresponding to that quadrant axis?
        *   Ex1: (5, 4) -> SE Quadrant. Axes are South, East. Changed South.
        *   Ex2: (-1, -4) -> NW Quadrant (wait, it's SW quadrant: dr negative is North, dc negative is West? No, dr positive is down/South in array coords). Let's use standard cartesian for atan2: y=dr, x=dc.
            *   Ex1: (dr=5, dc=4) -> Quadrant I (SE in grid coords). Axes: South, East. Changed South.
            *   Ex2: (dr=-1, dc=-4) -> Quadrant III (NW in grid coords). Axes: North, West. Changed West.
            *   Ex3: (dr=-3, dc=-7) -> Quadrant III (NW in grid coords). Axes: North, West. Changed North.
        *   This seems promising! When in a quadrant, choose one of the two axes. How to choose?
            *   Ex1: SE Quad. Chose South. |dr|=5, |dc|=4. Chose direction of larger magnitude component.
            *   Ex2: NW Quad. Chose West. |dr|=1, |dc|=4. Chose direction of larger magnitude component.
            *   Ex3: NW Quad. Chose North. |dr|=3, |dc|=7. Chose direction of *smaller* magnitude component?? Or maybe it always chooses North/South if possible? No, Ex2 chose West.

    *   Let's reconsider the simple "dominant direction" using absolute magnitude comparison again (Hypothesis 3).
        *   Ex1: V=(5, 4). |dr|>=|dc|. dr>0 -> South. Change South neighbor (6, 6). Correct.
        *   Ex2: V=(-1, -4). |dc|>|dr|. dc<0 -> West. Change West neighbor (4, 3). Correct.
        *   Ex3: V=(-3, -7). |dc|>|dr|. dc<0 -> West. Change West neighbor (5, 7). Expected North (4, 8).
        *   Why did I think Hypothesis 3 was wrong for Ex3 before? I wrote "Incorrect! Expected North (4, 8)". But looking at the coordinates: Source (5, 8). West neighbor is (5, 7). North neighbor is (4, 8). The rule predicts changing (5, 7) to maroon. The expected output changes (4, 8) to maroon. So yes, Hypothesis 3 is incorrect for Ex3.

    *   Let's try the Quadrant + Dominant Magnitude rule again (Hypothesis 4):
        1. Find Source (r_s, c_s), Target1 (r_t1, c_t1).
        2. Calculate V = (dr, dc) = (r_t1 - r_s, c_t1 - c_s).
        3. Determine Quadrant/Axis based on signs of dr, dc (using grid coords: +dr=South, +dc=East).
           * Q1 (SE): dr>0, dc>0
           * Q2 (SW): dr>0, dc<0
           * Q3 (NW): dr<0, dc<0
           * Q4 (NE): dr<0, dc>0
           * Axis S: dr>0, dc=0
           * Axis N: dr<0, dc=0
           * Axis E: dr=0, dc>0
           * Axis W: dr=0, dc<0
        4. Determine neighbor (r_n, c_n) to change:
           * If on Axis N/S/E/W, change neighbor in that direction.
           * If in Quadrant: compare |dr| and |dc|.
             * If |dr| >= |dc|, change neighbor in N/S direction (sign of dr).
             * If |dc| > |dr|, change neighbor in E/W direction (sign of dc).
        5. Perform changes: (r_s, c_s) -> gray(5), (r_t1, c_t1) -> maroon(9), (r_n, c_n) -> maroon(9).

        *   Test Hypothesis 4:
            *   Ex1: V=(5, 4). Q1 (SE). |dr|>=|dc|. dr>0 -> South. Change South neighbor (6, 6). Correct.
            *   Ex2: V=(-1, -4). Q3 (NW). |dc|>|dr|. dc<0 -> West. Change West neighbor (4, 3). Correct.
            *   Ex3: V=(-3, -7). Q3 (NW). |dc|>|dr|. dc<0 -> West. Change West neighbor (5, 7). Incorrect. Expected North (4, 8).

    *   This is consistently failing on Example 3. There must be a different logic.
    *   Could the choice depend on the *parity* of coordinates? Or distance?
    *   What if the 'maroon' color effectively *moves* from the source center to the target magenta pixel, but it has to pass *through* one of the gray border cells, changing it to maroon in the process? Which path does it take? Maybe the shortest path using only N/S/E/W steps?
        *   Ex1: Src(5,6) to Tgt1(10,10). Need 5 steps South, 4 steps East. Path could go SSSSS EEEE or EEEE SSSSS or mixed. The first step could be South to (6,6) or East to (5,7). The rule changed the South neighbor (6,6).
        *   Ex2: Src(4,4) to Tgt1(3,0). Need 1 step North, 4 steps West. Path could go N WWWW or WWWW N or mixed. First step North to (3,4) or West to (4,3). Rule changed West neighbor (4,3).
        *   Ex3: Src(5,8) to Tgt1(2,1). Need 3 steps North, 7 steps West. Path could go NNN WWWWWWW or WWWWWWW NNN or mixed. First step North to (4,8) or West to (5,7). Rule changed North neighbor (4,8).
        *   This "first step on a path" idea seems to match all examples! How to determine the first step? If it needs to move North/South and East/West, which direction takes precedence?
            *   Ex1: Needs South & East. Took South step. |South steps| = 5, |East steps| = 4. Took direction with more steps.
            *   Ex2: Needs North & West. Took West step. |North steps| = 1, |West steps| = 4. Took direction with more steps.
            *   Ex3: Needs North & West. Took North step. |North steps| = 3, |West steps| = 7. Took direction with *fewer* steps?? Inconsistent.

    *   Let's revisit the "Quadrant + Dominant Magnitude" rule (Hypothesis 4) and check my Ex3 analysis.
        *   Ex3: V=(-3, -7). Q3 (NW). |dc| > |dr| (7 > 3). Rule says use E/W direction. Since dc < 0, use West. Change West neighbor (5, 7). Expected output changed North neighbor (4, 8). Rule prediction is wrong.

    *   Final attempt: Is there *any* property that distinguishes Ex3?
        *   Source (5,8), Target (2,1). Both coordinates are odd/even or even/odd.
        *   Source (4,4), Target (3,0). Both even/even or odd/even.
        *   Source (5,6), Target (10,10). Odd/even, Even/even. No obvious parity link.

    *   Look at the exact mismatch location vs the prediction for Ex3 again.
        *   Source (5,8). Target (2,1). Vector (-3, -7).
        *   Dominant magnitude direction is West. Neighbor (5,7).
        *   Actual changed neighbor is North (4,8).
        *   What if the rule is: Take the dominant magnitude direction. If that neighbor exists and is gray, change it. *Unless*...?
        *   Is there some edge case? Grid boundaries? No.
        *   Is there another object nearby? In Ex3, there's an Azure(8) pixel at (5, 11), East of the pattern. Doesn't seem relevant.

    *   Could the rule involve *rotation*? Find pattern, find target, calculate relative vector, rotate the vector somehow, use the rotated vector to pick the neighbor? Seems overly complex.

    *   Let's assume the Quadrant+DominantMagnitude rule (Hypothesis 4) is the intended one, and re-verify the expected outputs.
        *   Ex1: Rule -> South. Expected -> South. OK.
        *   Ex2: Rule -> West. Expected -> West. OK.
        *   Ex3: Rule -> West. Expected -> North. MISMATCH.

    *   If Hypothesis 4 is correct, the Expected Output for Ex3 must be wrong. But assuming the Expected Outputs are correct, Hypothesis 4 is wrong.
    *   Let's trust the Expected Outputs. What rule produces S, W, N for Ex1, Ex2, Ex3?
        *   Ex1: V=(5, 4). |dr|>=|dc|. dr>0 -> South.
        *   Ex2: V=(-1, -4). |dc|>|dr|. dc<0 -> West.
        *   Ex3: V=(-3, -7). |dc|>|dr|. dc<0 -> West. BUT we need North.
        *   The *only* difference in logic for Ex3 would be if the comparison |dc| > |dr| was false, or if the resulting direction choice was overridden.
        *   Maybe if |dc| > |dr|, we choose the *vertical* direction instead?
            *   Ex1: |dr|>=|dc|. Choose vertical (South). Correct.
            *   Ex2: |dc|>|dr|. Choose vertical (North, since dr<0). Incorrect (Expected West).
        *   Maybe if |dr| >= |dc|, we choose the *horizontal* direction instead?
            *   Ex1: |dr|>=|dc|. Choose horizontal (East, since dc>0). Incorrect (Expected South).

    *   This feels like chasing ghosts. Let's simplify.
    *   Action 1: Center 9 -> 5. (Always happens).
    *   Action 2: Magenta 6 -> 9. (Always happens).
    *   Action 3: A gray neighbor 5 -> 9. Which neighbor?
        *   Ex1: South neighbor. V=(5,4). South is primary axis component.
        *   Ex2: West neighbor. V=(-1,-4). West is primary axis component.
        *   Ex3: North neighbor. V=(-3,-7). West is primary axis component, but North neighbor changes.
    *   The rule seems to be: Identify the neighbor corresponding to the primary axis component (based on larger magnitude difference). Change *that* neighbor, UNLESS... when? What is special about Ex3?
    *   In Ex3, both dr (-3) and dc (-7) are negative. In Ex2, both dr (-1) and dc (-4) are negative. In Ex1, both are positive (5, 4).
    *   Maybe if both components are negative (NW quadrant), there's a special rule?
        *   If |dr| >= |dc| (more North than West), choose North neighbor? (Doesn't apply to Ex2 or Ex3).
        *   If |dc| > |dr| (more West than North), choose North neighbor??
            *   Test this: Ex2: V=(-1,-4). |dc|>|dr|. Both negative. Choose North neighbor (3,4). Incorrect (Expected West).
            *   Test this: Ex3: V=(-3,-7). |dc|>|dr|. Both negative. Choose North neighbor (4,8). Correct!
        *   This rule works for Ex3, but breaks Ex2.

    *   Let's reconsider the "first step on path" idea.
        *   Ex1: Src(5,6) to Tgt1(10,10). Needs 5 S, 4 E. Path starts S? Yes.
        *   Ex2: Src(4,4) to Tgt1(3,0). Needs 1 N, 4 W. Path starts W? Yes.
        *   Ex3: Src(5,8) to Tgt1(2,1). Needs 3 N, 7 W. Path starts N? Yes.
        *   Why does the path start South in Ex1 (|dr|>|dc|), West in Ex2 (|dc|>|dr|), but North in Ex3 (|dc|>|dr|)?
        *   The choice of N/S vs E/W seems based on |dr| vs |dc|.
        *   If |dr| >= |dc|, use N/S step first.
        *   If |dc| > |dr|, use E/W step first.
        *   Let's retest *this* rule (Hypothesis 5):
            *   Ex1: V=(5, 4). |dr|>=|dc|. Use N/S step first. dr>0 -> South. Change South neighbor (6, 6). Correct.
            *   Ex2: V=(-1, -4). |dc|>|dr|. Use E/W step first. dc<0 -> West. Change West neighbor (4, 3). Correct.
            *   Ex3: V=(-3, -7). |dc|>|dr|. Use E/W step first. dc<0 -> West. Change West neighbor (5, 7). Incorrect! (Expected North).

    *   I am completely stuck on Example 3. The rule derived from Ex1 and Ex2 (Hypothesis 4 or 5) fails for Ex3. The rule needed for Ex3 fails for Ex2.
    *   Could the color being replaced matter? All neighbors are gray (5).
    *   Could the target color matter? It's always maroon (9).
    *   Could the source color matter? It's always maroon (9) changing to gray (5).
    *   Could the 'other' target matter? It's always magenta (6) changing to maroon (9).

    *   Let's perform the metric gathering. Maybe seeing the exact inputs/outputs side-by-side will help.
    *   Need to find: source center, magenta location, mismatch location 1 (where code put 5 but expected 9), mismatch location 2 (where code put 9 but expected 6). Wait, the code put 5 at the source center, which was correct in all examples. The code put 9 at the magenta location, which was correct in all examples. The *only* mismatch was the *third* location: the gray neighbor that should have become 9 but stayed 5.

    *   Ex1: Input(5,6)=9, Input(10,10)=6. Input(6,6)=5.
             Expected(5,6)=5, Expected(10,10)=6, Expected(6,6)=9.
             Transformed(5,6)=5, Transformed(10,10)=9, Transformed(6,6)=5.
             Mismatch: Expected(6,6)=9, Transformed(6,6)=5. Also Expected(10,10)=6, Transformed(10,10)=9.
             Ah! The problem description and my analysis were slightly off. The code changes the *magenta* pixel to maroon. The expected output *also* changes the magenta pixel to maroon. So that part is correct.
             The center maroon changes to gray. Correct.
             The discrepancy is *only* the gray neighbor.
             Ex1: Expected[6,6]=9, Transformed[6,6]=5. Mismatch at South neighbor. V=(5,4).
             Ex2: Expected[4,3]=9, Transformed[4,3]=5. Mismatch at West neighbor. V=(-1,-4).
             Ex3: Expected[4,8]=9, Transformed[4,8]=5. Mismatch at North neighbor. V=(-3,-7).

    *   Okay, the *only* error in the code is that it doesn't perform the third change: turning the correct gray neighbor maroon. The first two changes (center->gray, magenta->maroon) are correct.

    *   Now, why S, W, N for V=(5,4), V=(-1,-4), V=(-3,-7)?
        *   Hypothesis 4 (Quadrant + Dominant Magnitude) predicts S, W, W. Fails Ex3.
        *   Hypothesis 5 (Path start - Dominant Axis) predicts S, W, W. Fails Ex3.

    *   Let's look *very* closely at the input grid for Ex3 near the source (5,8).
        
```
              Col 7 8 9
        Row 4   5 5 5
        Row 5   5 9 5  <- Center (5,8)
        Row 6   5 5 5
        ```

        Target Tgt1 is (2,1). Vector is (-3, -7).
        Expected change is at North neighbor (4,8).
        Why North? Is there *anything* else pointing North? No obvious feature.

    *   What if the rule isn't about the vector V=(dr,dc) but about the absolute coordinates or relationship to grid center/edges? Seems unlikely for ARC.

    *   What if I misunderstood `atan2(y, x)`? `y` is row diff (dr), `x` is col diff (dc).
        *   Ex1: atan2(5, 4) = 51 deg.
        *   Ex2: atan2(-1, -4) = -166 deg (or 194 deg).
        *   Ex3: atan2(-3, -7) = -157 deg (or 203 deg).
        *   Angles relative to East=0: Ex1 ~51 (ESE), Ex2 ~194 (WSW), Ex3 ~203 (WSW).
        *   Neighbors: South, West, North. Still no clear mapping.

    *   Could it be related to the colors *around* the magenta pixel? No, that seems too complex and non-local.

    *   Maybe the choice prioritizes Vertical movement unless the horizontal distance is much larger? Like if |dc| > 2 * |dr|?
        *   Ex1: V=(5,4). |dr|>=|dc|. Vertical prio -> South. Correct.
        *   Ex2: V=(-1,-4). |dc| > |dr|. |dc|=4, |dr|=1. 4 > 2*1. Horizontal prio -> West. Correct.
        *   Ex3: V=(-3,-7). |dc| > |dr|. |dc|=7, |dr|=3. 7 > 2*3. Horizontal prio -> West. Incorrect (Expected North).

    *   Maybe Vertical unless |dr| == 0?
        *   Ex1: dr=5. Vertical -> South. Correct.
        *   Ex2: dr=-1. Vertical -> North. Incorrect (Expected West).
        *   Ex3: dr=-3. Vertical -> North. Correct.
        *   This works for 1 and 3, fails 2.

    *   Maybe Horizontal unless |dc| == 0?
        *   Ex1: dc=4. Horizontal -> East. Incorrect (Expected South).
        *   Ex2: dc=-4. Horizontal -> West. Correct.
        *   Ex3: dc=-7. Horizontal -> West. Incorrect (Expected North).

    *   There must be a simple geometric or topological rule.
    *   Let's assume Hypothesis 4 (Quadrant + Dominant Magnitude) is the *intended* logic and that the *Expected Output for Example 3* is somehow anomalous or implies a tie-breaking rule I haven't found.
        Hypothesis 4 predicts South, West, West.
        Observed is South, West, North.

    *   If V is (-3, -7), |dc| > |dr|, so West is chosen. Why would North be chosen instead?
    *   Is North neighbor somehow "special" in Ex3? The grid is 15x15. Source is (5,8). North neighbor is (4,8). Target is (2,1). Nothing obviously special.

    *   Okay, I'll document the facts based on the observed behavior (S, W, N) and formulate the natural language program to reflect that, even if the underlying logic for Ex3 remains unclear. The coder phase might require implementing Hypothesis 4 and seeing if it passes the test case, or explicitly handling the examples.

    *   **Natural Language Program Formulation:**
        1.  Identify the unique 3x3 object with a gray border and a maroon center. Let the center coordinates be (r_s, c_s).
        2.  Identify the unique magenta pixel. Let its coordinates be (r_t1, c_t1).
        3.  Calculate the relative vector V = (dr, dc) = (r_t1 - r_s, c_t1 - c_s).
        4.  Determine the target neighbor coordinates (r_n, c_n) based on V:
            *   If dr=5, dc=4 (Ex1 specific), (r_n, c_n) = (r_s + 1, c_s) (South neighbor).
            *   If dr=-1, dc=-4 (Ex2 specific), (r_n, c_n) = (r_s, c_s - 1) (West neighbor).
            *   If dr=-3, dc=-7 (Ex3 specific), (r_n, c_n) = (r_s - 1, c_s) (North neighbor).
            *   (Need a general rule here). Let's try Hypothesis 4 again and state the discrepancy.
            *   General Rule Attempt:
                *   If |dr| >= |dc|, the primary direction is North (if dr < 0) or South (if dr > 0).
                *   If |dc| > |dr|, the primary direction is West (if dc < 0) or East (if dc > 0).
                *   Let (r_n, c_n) be the coordinates of the neighbor in the primary direction.
                *   *Correction for Ex3*: If V=(-3,-7), override and choose North neighbor (4,8) instead of West neighbor (5,7). This is not generalizable yet.
        5.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
        6.  Change the pixel at (r_s, c_s) to gray.
        7.  Change the pixel at (r_t1, c_t1) to maroon.
        8.  Change the pixel at the determined neighbor coordinates (r_n, c_n) to maroon.

    *   Let's try to express step 4 generally based on the *observed* outcomes S, W, N.
        *   V=(5, 4) -> S
        *   V=(-1,-4) -> W
        *   V=(-3,-7) -> N
        *   Rule: Determine primary direction by comparing |dr| and |dc|. If |dr| >= |dc|, direction is N/S. If |dc| > |dr|, direction is W/E. *However*, if the vector is specifically (-3, -7), choose North instead of the predicted West. This is still too specific.

    *   Maybe the rule is simply: Find the neighbor N, S, E, or W that minimizes the distance (or Manhattan distance) to the target magenta pixel?
        *   Ex1: Src(5,6), Tgt1(10,10). Neighbors: N(4,6), S(6,6), W(5,5), E(5,7).
            *   Dist S(6,6) to Tgt1(10,10): Manhat = |10-6|+|10-6|=4+4=8. Euclid = sqrt(4^2+4^2)=sqrt(32).
            *   Dist E(5,7) to Tgt1(10,10): Manhat = |10-5|+|10-7|=5+3=8. Euclid = sqrt(5^2+3^2)=sqrt(34).
            *   Dist N(4,6) to Tgt1(10,10): Manhat = |10-4|+|10-6|=6+4=10.
            *   Dist W(5,5) to Tgt1(10,10): Manhat = |10-5|+|10-5|=5+5=10.
            *   Tie between S and E using Manhattan. S chosen. Why S over E? Maybe default to N/S?
        *   Ex2: Src(4,4), Tgt1(3,0). Neighbors: N(3,4), S(5,4), W(4,3), E(4,5).
            *   Dist W(4,3) to Tgt1(3,0): Manhat = |3-4|+|0-3|=1+3=4. Euclid = sqrt(1^2+3^2)=sqrt(10).
            *   Dist N(3,4) to Tgt1(3,0): Manhat = |3-3|+|0-4|=0+4=4. Euclid = sqrt(0^2+4^2)=sqrt(16).
            *   Dist S(5,4) to Tgt1(3,0): Manhat = |3-5|+|0-4|=2+4=6.
            *   Dist E(4,5) to Tgt1(3,0): Manhat = |3-4|+|0-5|=1+5=6.
            *   Tie between N and W using Manhattan. W chosen. Why W over N? Maybe default to W/E?
        *   Ex3: Src(5,8), Tgt1(2,1). Neighbors: N(4,8), S(6,8), W(5,7), E(5,9).
            *   Dist N(4,8) to Tgt1(2,1): Manhat = |2-4|+|1-8|=2+7=9. Euclid = sqrt(2^2+7^2)=sqrt(53).
            *   Dist W(5,7) to Tgt1(2,1): Manhat = |2-5|+|1-7|=3+6=9. Euclid = sqrt(3^2+6^2)=sqrt(45).
            *   Dist S(6,8) to Tgt1(2,1): Manhat = |2-6|+|1-8|=4+7=11.
            *   Dist E(5,9) to Tgt1(2,1): Manhat = |2-5|+|1-9|=3+8=11.
            *   Tie between N and W using Manhattan. N chosen. Why N over W? Euclidean distance prefers W (sqrt(45) < sqrt(53)).
        *   The "closest neighbor" rule doesn't seem to work consistently either, especially with ties.

    *   Okay, let's stick to Hypothesis 4 (Quadrant + Dominant Magnitude) as the most plausible general rule derived from Ex1 and Ex2, and note the discrepancy in Ex3.

    *   **Refined Natural Language Program (Based on Hypo 4):**
        1.  Identify the unique 3x3 object with a gray border and a maroon center. Let the center coordinates be (r_s, c_s).
        2.  Identify the unique magenta pixel. Let its coordinates be (r_t1, c_t1).
        3.  Calculate the vector V = (dr, dc) = (r_t1 - r_s, c_t1 - c_s).
        4.  Determine the primary direction based on the component of V with the larger absolute magnitude. If magnitudes are equal, prioritize the vertical (North/South) direction.
            *   If |dr| >= |dc|, the primary direction is North (if dr < 0) or South (if dr >= 0).
            *   If |dc| > |dr|, the primary direction is West (if dc < 0) or East (if dc > 0).
        5.  Determine the coordinates (r_n, c_n) of the gray neighbor adjacent to the center (r_s, c_s) in the primary direction.
        6.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
        7.  Change the pixel at (r_s, c_s) from maroon (9) to gray (5).
        8.  Change the pixel at (r_t1, c_t1) from magenta (6) to maroon (9).
        9.  Change the pixel at the neighbor coordinates (r_n, c_n) from gray (5) to maroon (9).

    *   This rule predicts S, W, W for the neighbors. It will match Ex1, Ex2, but fail Ex3 (predicting West instead of North). This seems the most logical step forward - implement the simplest consistent rule found and see if it works on the test case, or requires further refinement based on the test case result.## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided code implements a transformation rule based on initial observations, likely from the first example only. The rule involves finding a specific 3x3 pattern (gray border, maroon center) and a unique magenta pixel. It then swaps the colors of the pattern's center (maroon -> gray) and the magenta pixel (magenta -> maroon).

Testing this code against all three training examples reveals a consistent pattern of failure: while the code correctly changes the pattern's center to gray and the magenta pixel to maroon, the expected output requires an *additional* change. Specifically, one of the gray pixels *adjacent* (N, S, E, W) to the pattern's center also needs to change to maroon. The existing code does not perform this third change, leading to a one-pixel difference in each example's output compared to the expected output.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the locations of the source pattern, the magenta pixel, and the required third change (the gray neighbor) in each example.
2.  Determine the rule that selects *which* gray neighbor (North, South, East, or West relative to the pattern center) should be changed to maroon. This rule appears to depend on the relative position of the magenta pixel with respect to the source pattern's center.
3.  Refine the natural language program to include this third transformation step and the logic for selecting the correct neighbor.

## Metrics and Evidence Gathering

Let's gather precise information about the key locations in each example.

*   **Source Pattern:** 3x3 gray (5) border, maroon (9) center.
*   **Target 1:** Unique magenta (6) pixel.
*   **Target 2:** The gray (5) neighbor of the source center that changes to maroon (9) in the expected output.
