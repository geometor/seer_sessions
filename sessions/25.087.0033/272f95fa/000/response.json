These lines intersect, forming a grid-like structure within the larger grid.\n    *   The rest of the input grid pixels are white (color 0).\n    *   In the output grids, the azure lines remain unchanged.\n    *   Specific regions defined by the azure lines are filled with different colors. These regions appear to be the central area bounded by the innermost azure lines, and the areas immediately above, below, left, and right of this central area, also bounded by the azure lines.\n    *   The white pixels outside these specific bounded regions remain white in the output.\n    *   The colors used for filling seem consistent across examples:\n        *   Region above center: Red (2)\n        *   Region left of center: Yellow (4)\n        *   Central region: Magenta (6)\n        *   Region right of center: Green (3)\n        *   Region below center: Blue (1)\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Identify all row indices corresponding to complete horizontal lines of azure pixels (8).\n    3.  Identify all column indices corresponding to complete vertical lines of azure pixels (8).\n    4.  Determine the indices of the two innermost horizontal azure lines and the two innermost vertical azure lines. Let these define the boundaries: `top_row`, `bottom_row`, `left_col`, `right_col`.\n    5.  Define the coordinates for five specific regions bounded by these lines:\n        *   **Central Region:** Rows between `top_row` and `bottom_row` (exclusive), Columns between `left_col` and `right_col` (exclusive).\n        *   **Top Region:** Rows between the horizontal line *above* `top_row` (if it exists) and `top_row`, Columns between `left_col` and `right_col` (exclusive). If only two horizontal lines exist, this region is defined by rows above `top_row`. *Correction:* Identify the horizontal lines bounding the central region above and below (`h1`, `h2`) and the vertical lines bounding it left and right (`v1`, `v2`).\n            *   Central Region: Rows `(h1+1)` to `(h2-1)`, Columns `(v1+1)` to `(v2-1)`.\n            *   Top Region: Rows `(h0+1)` to `(h1-1)` (where `h0` is the line above `h1`), Columns `(v1+1)` to `(v2-1)`.\n            *   Bottom Region: Rows `(h2+1)` to `(h3-1)` (where `h3` is the line below `h2`), Columns `(v1+1)` to `(v2-1)`.\n            *   Left Region: Rows `(h1+1)` to `(h2-1)`, Columns `(v0+1)` to `(v1-1)` (where `v0` is the line left of `v1`).\n            *   Right Region: Rows `(h1+1)` to `(h2-1)`, Columns `(v2+1)` to `(v3-1)` (where `v3` is the line right of `v2`).\n    6.  Iterate through the pixels within the calculated coordinates for each of the five regions.\n    7.  If a pixel in the **Central Region** has the initial color white (0), change its color in the output grid to magenta (6).\n    8.  If a pixel in the **Top Region** has the initial color white (0), change its color in the output grid to red (2).\n    9.  If a pixel in the **Bottom Region** has the initial color white (0), change its color in the output grid to blue (1).\n    10. If a pixel in the **Left Region** has the initial color white (0), change its color in the output grid to yellow (4).\n    11. If a pixel in the **Right Region** has the initial color white (0), change its color in the output grid to green (3).\n    12. Leave all other pixels (azure lines and white pixels outside the five specified regions) unchanged.\n    13. Return the modified output grid."
