"""
The transformation identifies horizontal and vertical lines of azure pixels (8) that divide the grid. 
It assumes there are exactly two horizontal and two vertical lines. 
These lines define nine regions. 
The transformation fills the white pixels (0) in five specific regions with distinct colors, leaving the azure lines and other white areas unchanged.
The central region, bounded exclusively by the four azure lines, is filled with magenta (6).
The region directly above the central region (between the top edge/previous line and the upper central line, and between the vertical lines) is filled with red (2).
The region directly below the central region (between the lower central line and the bottom edge/next line, and between the vertical lines) is filled with blue (1).
The region directly to the left of the central region (between the horizontal lines, and between the left edge/previous line and the left central line) is filled with yellow (4).
The region directly to the right of the central region (between the horizontal lines, and between the right central line and the right edge/next line) is filled with green (3).
