Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1. Determine the background color by finding the most frequent color value in the input grid.
2. Find all connected groups of pixels (objects) that have a color different from the background color, considering pixels connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (8-way connectivity) as part of the same group.
3. For each object found, count how many distinct connected regions of the background color are entirely surrounded by pixels of that object (these are the "holes").
4. Create a list of candidate objects consisting only of those objects that have exactly one hole or exactly two holes.
5. If this list of candidate objects contains only one object, choose that object.
6. If the list contains more than one candidate object, calculate the absolute difference between the background color's numerical value and the numerical value of the color of each candidate object. Choose the object for which this difference is the smallest.
7. Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by the chosen object to define its bounding box.
8. Construct the output grid by copying all pixels from the input grid that fall within this bounding box (inclusive of the minimum and maximum rows and columns).
