Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains a background color (the most frequent color) and several distinct shapes (objects) composed of other colors.
2.  **Objects:** The shapes are contiguous blocks of a single color, distinct from the background. They often resemble letters, numbers, or symbols (e.g., '5', 'T', 'E', 'H', 'S', '8', '4', 'M'). Connectivity seems to include diagonals (8-way connectivity).
3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is always a rectangular subgrid derived from the input. It contains exactly one of the shapes from the input, displayed against the original background color of the input grid.
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task is to identify which *specific* shape from the input should be extracted and presented in the output.
5.  **Selection Criteria:** The selection seems based on the topological property of the shapes â€“ specifically, the number of "holes" they contain. A hole is a region of the background color completely enclosed by the shape's color. The shapes selected in the examples ('5', 'E', 'S', '4') have either one or two holes. Other shapes present either have zero holes ('T', 'L', 'M') or possibly more than two (like the complex azure shape in example 4).
6.  **Tie-breaking:** In cases where multiple shapes meet the primary criterion (e.g., having 2 holes in examples 2 and 3), a secondary criterion is needed. Comparing the color index of the candidate shapes to the background color index, the shape whose color index has the *smallest absolute difference* from the background color index appears to be chosen.
7.  **Output Construction:** Once the target shape is selected, its bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing it) is determined. The output grid is a direct copy of the input grid's content within that bounding box.

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  problem_type: object_selection_and_extraction
  input_features:
    - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
    - background_color: most frequent color in the grid
    - objects: multiple contiguous regions of non-background colors
    - object_properties:
        - color: the single color composing the object
        - pixels: list of coordinates for each pixel in the object
        - bounding_box: min/max row/col defining the smallest enclosing rectangle
        - holes: count of contiguous regions of background color completely enclosed by the object
  output_features:
    - grid: 2D array (subgrid of input)
    - content: contains exactly one object from the input
    - background: pixels not part of the object retain the original input background color
    - size: determined by the bounding box of the selected object

transformation_rules:
  - step: 1. Identify the background color (most frequent color) of the input grid.
  - step: 2. Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-background colors. Assume 8-way connectivity.
  - step: 3. For each object, determine the number of holes (regions of background color fully enclosed by the object).
  - step: 4. Filter the objects, keeping only those with exactly 1 or 2 holes.
  - step: 5. Selection:
      - If the filtered list contains exactly one object, select it.
      - If the filtered list contains multiple objects:
          - Calculate the absolute difference between each object's color index and the background color index.
          - Select the object with the minimum absolute color difference.
          - (Assumption: No further ties occur in the provided examples).
  - step: 6. Determine the bounding box of the selected object.
  - step: 7. Create the output grid by copying the portion of the input grid defined by the selected object's bounding box.

    filtered_objects (1 or 2 holes): {color: 8}
    selected_object: color 8 (azure)

      - color: 3 (green), shape: 'S', holes: 2

    tie_breaker: |1-8|=7, |1-3|=2. Minimum difference is 2.

    objects:
      - color: 2 (red), shape: '4', holes: 1
      - color: 3 (green), shape: 'M', holes: 0
      - color: 8 (azure), shape: 'H's, holes: >2 (likely 3 or 4 depending on connectivity interpretation)
    filtered_objects (1 or 2 holes): {color: 2}
    selected_object: color 2 (red)
    output: bounding box of the red object.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the background color by finding the most frequent color value in the input grid.
2.  Find all connected groups of pixels (objects) that have a color different from the background color, considering pixels connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally as part of the same group.
3.  For each object found, count how many distinct connected regions of the background color are entirely surrounded by pixels of that object (these are the "holes").
4.  Create a list of candidate objects consisting only of those objects that have exactly one hole or exactly two holes.
5.  If this list of candidate objects contains only one object, choose that object.
6.  If the list contains more than one candidate object, calculate the absolute difference between the background color's numerical value and the numerical value of the color of each candidate object. Choose the object for which this difference is the smallest.
7.  Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by the chosen object to define its bounding box.
8.  Construct the output grid by copying all pixels from the input grid that fall within this bounding box (inclusive of the minimum and maximum rows and columns).
