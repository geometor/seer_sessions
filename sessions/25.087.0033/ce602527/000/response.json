            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains a background color (the most frequent color) and several distinct shapes (objects) composed of other colors.\n2.  **Objects:** The shapes are contiguous blocks of a single color, distinct from the background. They often resemble letters, numbers, or symbols (e.g., '5', 'T', 'E', 'H', 'S', '8', '4', 'M'). Connectivity seems to include diagonals (8-way connectivity).\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is always a rectangular subgrid derived from the input. It contains exactly one of the shapes from the input, displayed against the original background color of the input grid.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task is to identify which *specific* shape from the input should be extracted and presented in the output.\n5.  **Selection Criteria:** The selection seems based on the topological property of the shapes \u2013 specifically, the number of \"holes\" they contain. A hole is a region of the background color completely enclosed by the shape's color. The shapes selected in the examples ('5', 'E', 'S', '4') have either one or two holes. Other shapes present either have zero holes ('T', 'L', 'M') or possibly more than two (like the complex azure shape in example 4).\n6.  **Tie-breaking:** In cases where multiple shapes meet the primary criterion (e.g., having 2 holes in examples 2 and 3), a secondary criterion is needed. Comparing the color index of the candidate shapes to the background color index, the shape whose color index has the *smallest absolute difference* from the background color index appears to be chosen.\n7.  **Output Construction:** Once the target shape is selected, its bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing it) is determined. The output grid is a direct copy of the input grid's content within that bounding box.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
