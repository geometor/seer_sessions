task_elements:
  - Input Grid:
      type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
      properties:
        - Contains multiple colors (0-9).
        - Typically structured into large regions of uniform color ('backgrounds').
        - Contains sparse pixels of a single distinct color ('noise') located within or adjacent to background regions.
  - Output Value:
      type: integer (pixel color value)
      properties:
        - Represents one of the background colors found in the input grid.
objects:
  - Noise Pixels:
      attributes:
        - color: The color with the minimum total count in the grid.
        - location: Coordinates (row, col).
        - quantity: Small number of occurrences.
        - distribution: Sparse, isolated within or adjacent to larger regions.
  - Background Regions:
      attributes:
        - color: Colors other than the noise color, forming large contiguous areas.
        - location: Occupy significant portions of the grid.
relationships:
  - Association:
      type: Spatial adjacency
      description: Each noise pixel is associated with the background color of its neighbouring pixels.
actions:
  - Identify Noise Color: Find the color with the minimum occurrence count in the grid.
  - Identify Background Colors: All colors present except the noise color.
  - Count Associations: For each noise pixel, determine its associated background color (from neighbours) and increment a counter for that background color.
  - Determine Maximum Count: Find the background color(s) with the highest association count.
  - Apply Tie-breaker: If multiple background colors share the maximum count, select the one with the highest numerical color value.
  - Output Result: Return the selected background color value.
