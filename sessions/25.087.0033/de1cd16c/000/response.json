Within these regions, there are scattered, isolated pixels of a different color (let's call these \"noise\" pixels). All noise pixels within a single grid seem to be of the same color.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core task appears to involve analyzing the relationship between the noise pixels and the background regions they reside in or are adjacent to. The output color is one of the background colors present in the input.\n5.  **Key Observation:** The output color corresponds to the background color that is associated with the *highest number* of noise pixels.\n6.  **Noise Identification:** The noise color can be identified as the color with the minimum count of occurrences in the entire grid.\n7.  **Association:** A noise pixel is associated with a specific background color by examining its immediate 8 neighbours. Assuming the noise pixel is isolated, its neighbours will predominantly (or entirely) consist of a single background color.\n8.  **Tie-breaking:** If multiple background colors are associated with the same maximum number of noise pixels, the background color with the *highest numerical value* is chosen as the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
