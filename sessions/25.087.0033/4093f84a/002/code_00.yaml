task_context:
  description: The task involves modifying a grid based on the positions of colored pixels (blue, red, green) relative to a central horizontal block of gray pixels.
  input_features:
    - type: grid
      description: Contains a background of white (0), a prominent horizontal block of gray (5), and scattered pixels of blue (1), red (2), or green (3).
    - gray_block:
        property: horizontal, contiguous
        color: 5 (gray)
        location: occupies one or more full rows, typically near the vertical center.
    - colored_pixels:
        property: discrete
        color: 1 (blue), 2 (red), or 3 (green)
        location: scattered outside the gray block (above or below).
  output_features:
    - type: grid
      description: Modified version of the input grid.
    - gray_block_modification:
        action: imprint
        source: colored_pixels (1, 2, 3) outside the gray block
        target_location_rule:
          - if colored_pixel is above the block (row < min_gray_row) at column 'c': target is (min_gray_row - 1, c)
          - if colored_pixel is below the block (row > max_gray_row) at column 'c': target is (max_gray_row + 1, c)
        imprint_color: 5 (gray)
        effect: The target cell's color is changed to gray. If multiple colored pixels map to the same target cell, the gray color is set once.
    - colored_pixel_removal:
        action: remove
        target: all original colored_pixels (1, 2, 3)
        effect: The cells where the original colored pixels were located are changed to white (0).
