Example 1 might follow a different rule or require a more nuanced definition of the \"block\" boundaries if the simple min/max row approach covers the entire grid height. This implementation prioritizes the pattern observed in examples 2 and 3.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_gray_block_boundaries(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the top-most and bottom-most row indices containing gray (5) pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (min_row, max_row) or (None, None) if no gray pixels are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    gray_rows = np.where(grid == 5)[0]\n    if len(gray_rows) == 0:\n        return None, None\n    # Convert numpy integers to standard Python integers\n    return int(np.min(gray_rows)), int(np.max(gray_rows))\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list): A list of lists representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_np = np.copy(input_np)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n\n    # Find the boundaries of the gray block based on row indices\n    min_gray_row, max_gray_row = find_gray_block_boundaries(input_np)\n\n    # If no gray block exists, return the original grid copy\n    if min_gray_row is None:\n        return output_np.tolist()\n\n    # --- Step 1: Create Gray Imprints ---\n    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid to find source pixels\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            color = input_np[r, c]\n\n            # Check if the pixel is one of the source colors (1, 2, 3)\n            if color in [1, 2, 3]:\n                # Check if the pixel is above the gray block's row range\n                if r < min_gray_row:\n                    # Calculate the target row for the imprint (just above the block)\n                    target_r = min_gray_row - 1\n                    # Ensure the target row is within grid bounds\n                    if 0 <= target_r < height:\n                        # Place the gray imprint in the output grid\n                        output_np[target_r, c] = 5\n                # Check if the pixel is below the gray block's row range\n                elif r > max_gray_row:\n                    # Calculate the target row for the imprint (just below the block)\n                    target_r = max_gray_row + 1\n                    # Ensure the target row is within grid bounds\n                    if 0 <= target_r < height:\n                        # Place the gray imprint in the output grid\n                        output_np[target_r, c] = 5\n\n    # --- Step 2: Remove Original Colored Pixels ---\n    # Iterate through the grid again to remove original 1, 2, 3 pixels\n    # This is done in a separate pass to ensure imprints are not accidentally removed\n    # if they landed on a location that originally held a colored pixel (although unlikely with this rule).\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check the color in the *original* input grid\n            if input_np[r, c] in [1, 2, 3]:\n                # Change the pixel location to white in the output grid\n                output_np[r, c] = 0\n\n    # Convert the result back to a list of lists\n    output_grid = output_np.tolist()\n    return output_grid\n```"
