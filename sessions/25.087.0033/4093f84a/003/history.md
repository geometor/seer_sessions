Identifies a central horizontal block of gray (5) pixels.
For each colored pixel (green 3, red 2, blue 1) found outside this block:
- If the pixel is above the block, it casts a gray (5) imprint onto the cell directly above the block in the same column.
- If the pixel is below the block, it casts a gray (5) imprint onto the cell directly below the block in the same column.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the task.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code successfully identified the gray block and the colored pixels (blue, red, green) outside it. However, it failed in two key aspects based on the comparison with expected outputs:

1.  **Imprint Location:** The code placed the gray imprint in the row *adjacent* to the gray block (`min_gray_row - 1` or `max_gray_row + 1`). The examples show the gray color should appear *within* the boundary rows of the original gray block (`min_gray_row` or `max_gray_row`), effectively extending the block vertically in those specific columns.
2.  **Handling of Green Pixels:** The code incorrectly preserved the green (3) pixels. Example 1 clearly shows that green pixels, like red (2) and blue (1), should be removed (changed to white 0) in the output after their corresponding gray extension is made.

**Strategy:**

1.  Re-analyze the input-output pairs to confirm the pattern of gray block extension and colored pixel removal.
2.  Use `tool_code` to gather precise metrics about the gray block boundaries, colored pixel locations, and the locations of the "new" gray pixels in the output.
3.  Update the YAML facts based on the refined understanding.
4.  Rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation, emphasizing the extension *within* the block's original boundary rows and the removal of *all* source colored pixels (1, 2, 3).

**Analysis Refinement based on Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:** The metrics script identifies the gray block boundaries incorrectly as `(0, 13)`. This is because the simple `np.where(grid == 5)` finds *all* gray pixels, including those in the output that are *part* of the transformation result, not just the central block. The central block in example 1's *input* is actually rows 0 through 13, columns 4 through 8. This means *all* green pixels are actually *outside* this central 5x14 block. The script correctly identifies that original colored pixels are removed. The target row verification fails because the initial gray block detection was flawed.
*   **Examples 2 & 3:** The gray block boundaries `(5, 8)` and `(7, 8)` respectively seem correct for the main horizontal block in the inputs. The script identifies colored pixels above and below correctly. However, the `original_colored_removed_expected` is `False` which contradicts visual inspection of the examples. Let me re-run the check for removed pixels manually.

    *   **Re-check Example 2:** Input colored pixels at (0,8), (2,2), (3,10) [above] and (9,9), (10,1), (11,4), (12,11) [below]. All these coordinates are 0 (white) in `expected_2`. The script result `False` is wrong.
    *   **Re-check Example 3:** Input colored pixels at (1,7), (3,3), (3,7), (3,12), (5,8) [above] and (9,1), (10,11), (11,3), (11,8) [below]. All these coordinates are 0 (white) in `expected_3`. The script result `False` is wrong.

    *Correction:* The `original_colored_removed` check in the script was flawed. Visual inspection and manual checks confirm *all* original colored pixels (1, 2, 3) are indeed turned to white (0) in the expected outputs.

*   **Target Row Verification:** The verification failed because it was comparing the "new" gray pixels in the output (which are in rows `min_gray_row - 1` and `max_gray_row + 1` according to the *expected* output) against the detected boundaries (`min_gray_row`, `max_gray_row`) of the *input* gray block.

    *   **Example 2:** Input block rows (5, 8). New gray pixels are in rows 4 and 9.
    *   **Example 3:** Input block rows (7, 8). New gray pixels are in rows 6 and 9. (The output has pixels at 5,7 and 6,x - let me re-examine Example 3 output grid).

    *Correction for Example 3 Output Interpretation:*
    Input block rows: 7, 8.
    Pixels above: (1,7), (3,3), (3,7), (3,12), (5,8). -> Columns 7, 3, 7, 12, 8. Expected output row above block: `min_gray_row - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6`. Output grid `expected_3` has new gray pixels at `(6, 3)`, `(6, 7)`, `(6, 8)`, `(6, 12)`. Wait, the pixel at `(5,8)` in the input resulted in gray at `(6,8)`. The pixel at `(1,7)` resulted in gray at `(6,7)`. The pixel at `(3,3)` resulted in gray at `(6,3)`. The pixel at `(3,12)` resulted in gray at `(6,12)`. This confirms the rule: pixel above block at `(r, c)` changes output pixel at `(min_gray_row - 1, c)` to gray.
    Pixels below: (9,1), (10,11), (11,3), (11,8). -> Columns 1, 11, 3, 8. Expected output row below block: `max_gray_row + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9`. Output grid `expected_3` has new gray pixels at `(9, 1)`, `(9, 3)`, `(9, 8)`, `(9, 11)`. This confirms the rule: pixel below block at `(r, c)` changes output pixel at `(max_gray_row + 1, c)` to gray.

    *Conclusion from metrics and re-analysis:* The original interpretation that failed was: "gray imprint onto the cell *directly* above/below the block". The correct interpretation, matching the examples, is: "gray imprint onto the cell in the row *immediately* preceding the top of the block / *immediately* succeeding the bottom of the block, in the same column". The original code implemented this correctly, *but* it failed to remove the green pixels.

**Revised Assessment:** The initial code logic for placing the gray pixels was actually correct based on a careful reading of Examples 2 and 3. The primary failure was not removing the green pixels in Example 1. The secondary failure in Example 2 (`transformed_output[9, 9]` was 0 instead of 5) and Example 3 (`transformed_output[9, 1]` was 0 instead of 5) likely stems from an issue in how the iteration or update was performed, possibly overwriting a gray imprint if multiple colored pixels existed in the same column, or if the removal step interfered.

**Final Strategy Adjustment:** Modify the previous code simply to ensure green (3) pixels are also removed (set to 0) in the output grid, similar to blue (1) and red (2). Ensure the logic correctly handles multiple colored pixels in the same column potentially imprinting onto the same target cell (the last one processed would win, which seems consistent with the expected outputs where only one gray pixel appears per target cell).

        imprint_color: 5 (gray)
        effect: The target cell's color is changed to gray. If multiple colored pixels map to the same target cell, the gray color is set once.
    - colored_pixel_removal:
        action: remove
        target: all original colored_pixels (1, 2, 3)
        effect: The cells where the original colored pixels were located are changed to white (0).

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Boundaries:** Find the top-most row (`min_gray_row`) and bottom-most row (`max_gray_row`) that contain any gray (5) pixels belonging to the main horizontal gray block. (Note: Need a robust way to define the "main" block if there are stray gray pixels, but examples suggest it's the largest contiguous horizontal one). Assume the block spans the full width between `min_gray_row` and `max_gray_row`.
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
3.  **Process Colored Pixels and Imprint Gray:** Iterate through each cell (`r`, `c`) of the *input* grid:
    *   If the cell contains a blue (1), red (2), or green (3) pixel:
        *   If the pixel is above the gray block (`r < min_gray_row`):
            *   Calculate the target row `target_r = min_gray_row - 1`.
            *   If `target_r` is a valid row index (>= 0), change the color of the cell at (`target_r`, `c`) in the *output* grid to gray (5).
        *   If the pixel is below the gray block (`r > max_gray_row`):
            *   Calculate the target row `target_r = max_gray_row + 1`.
            *   If `target_r` is a valid row index (< grid height), change the color of the cell at (`target_r`, `c`) in the *output* grid to gray (5).
4.  **Remove Original Colored Pixels:** After processing all cells for imprinting, iterate through each cell (`r`, `c`) of the *output* grid:
    *   Check the color of the corresponding cell (`r`, `c`) in the *original input* grid.
    *   If the *original input* cell color was blue (1), red (2), or green (3), change the color of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the *output* grid to white (0). (This ensures imprints made in step 3 aren't accidentally removed if they landed on a location that originally held a colored pixel, which shouldn't happen based on the rules but is safer). *Alternative simpler logic: After step 3, iterate through input grid, find all 1,2,3 pixels and set output grid at those locations to 0.*
5.  **Return Output:** Return the modified output grid.
