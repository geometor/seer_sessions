Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example (14x14).
2.  **Dominant Feature:** In all input examples, there's a prominent horizontal block composed entirely of gray (5) pixels. This block spans most, if not all, of the grid's width, but its vertical position and thickness vary between examples.
3.  **Scattered Pixels:** Besides the gray block and the white (0) background, there are scattered pixels of other colors: green (3) in example 1, red (2) in example 2, and blue (1) in example 3. These colored pixels appear both above and below the gray block.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve these scattered colored pixels interacting with the gray block.
    *   In the output grids, new gray (5) pixels appear, positioned vertically aligned with the original colored pixels.
    *   Specifically, if a colored pixel is above the gray block, a new gray pixel appears in the same column, typically just *above* the top boundary of the original gray block.
    *   If a colored pixel is below the gray block, a new gray pixel appears in the same column, typically just *below* the bottom boundary of the original gray block.
    *   The fate of the original colored pixels differs:
        *   In example 1 (green), the original green pixels remain in the output.
        *   In examples 2 (red) and 3 (blue), the original red and blue pixels are removed (turned white) in the output.
5.  **Interpretation:** It looks like the colored pixels are casting an "imprint" or "shadow" onto the rows immediately adjacent (vertically) to the main gray block. The color of the source pixel determines whether the source pixel itself persists after casting the imprint.

**Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid: A 2D array of pixels (integers 0-9).
  - output_grid: A 2D array of pixels, same dimensions as input.
  - background_color: white (0).
  - main_object:
      type: horizontal block
      color: gray (5)
      properties:
        - spans horizontally, potentially full width
        - contiguous vertically
        - defines a vertical region (top_row, bottom_row)
  - source_pixels:
      type: individual pixels
      colors: [green (3), red (2), blue (1)]
      location: Scattered outside the gray block (above or below).
  - transformation:
      action: projection/imprinting
      direction: vertical (downwards for pixels above the block, upwards for pixels below)
      target_location: The row immediately adjacent to the gray block in the column of the source pixel.
      target_color: gray (5)
      source_pixel_fate:
        - green (3): Persists in the output.
        - red (2): Removed (becomes white 0) in the output.
        - blue (1): Removed (becomes white 0) in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. Determine its topmost row index (`min_gray_row`) and bottommost row index (`max_gray_row`).
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid.
4.  If the pixel at `(r, c)` is green (3), red (2), or blue (1):
    *   If `r < min_gray_row` (the pixel is above the gray block):
        *   Change the pixel at `(min_gray_row - 1, c)` in the *output* grid to gray (5).
    *   If `r > max_gray_row` (the pixel is below the gray block):
        *   Change the pixel at `(max_gray_row + 1, c)` in the *output* grid to gray (5).
    *   If the original pixel color was red (2) or blue (1):
        *   Change the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to white (0).
        *   (If the original pixel color was green (3), its position in the output grid remains unchanged from the initial copy).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
