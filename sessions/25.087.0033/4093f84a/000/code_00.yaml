facts:
  - input_grid: A 2D array of pixels (integers 0-9).
  - output_grid: A 2D array of pixels, same dimensions as input.
  - background_color: white (0).
  - main_object:
      type: horizontal block
      color: gray (5)
      properties:
        - spans horizontally, potentially full width
        - contiguous vertically
        - defines a vertical region (top_row, bottom_row)
  - source_pixels:
      type: individual pixels
      colors: [green (3), red (2), blue (1)]
      location: Scattered outside the gray block (above or below).
  - transformation:
      action: projection/imprinting
      direction: vertical (downwards for pixels above the block, upwards for pixels below)
      target_location: The row immediately adjacent to the gray block in the column of the source pixel.
      target_color: gray (5)
      source_pixel_fate:
        - green (3): Persists in the output.
        - red (2): Removed (becomes white 0) in the output.
        - blue (1): Removed (becomes white 0) in the output.
