            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example (14x14).\n2.  **Dominant Feature:** In all input examples, there's a prominent horizontal block composed entirely of gray (5) pixels. This block spans most, if not all, of the grid's width, but its vertical position and thickness vary between examples.\n3.  **Scattered Pixels:** Besides the gray block and the white (0) background, there are scattered pixels of other colors: green (3) in example 1, red (2) in example 2, and blue (1) in example 3. These colored pixels appear both above and below the gray block.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve these scattered colored pixels interacting with the gray block.\n    *   In the output grids, new gray (5) pixels appear, positioned vertically aligned with the original colored pixels.\n    *   Specifically, if a colored pixel is above the gray block, a new gray pixel appears in the same column, typically just *above* the top boundary of the original gray block.\n    *   If a colored pixel is below the gray block, a new gray pixel appears in the same column, typically just *below* the bottom boundary of the original gray block.\n    *   The fate of the original colored pixels differs:\n        *   In example 1 (green), the original green pixels remain in the output.\n        *   In examples 2 (red) and 3 (blue), the original red and blue pixels are removed (turned white) in the output.\n5.  **Interpretation:** It looks like the colored pixels are casting an \"imprint\" or \"shadow\" onto the rows immediately adjacent (vertically) to the main gray block. The color of the source pixel determines whether the source pixel itself persists after casting the imprint.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
