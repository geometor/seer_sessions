"""
Performs a point reflection of specific objects across the center of a unique marker object, preserving both originals and adding reflections.

1. Find the Marker: Locate the unique 5-pixel object in the input grid where a central pixel and its four diagonal neighbors share the same non-background color. Identify the coordinates of this central pixel (`center_coord`) and the set of all 5 coordinates belonging to this marker (`marker_pixels`).
2. Copy Input to Output: Create the initial `output_grid` by making an exact copy of the `input_grid`.
3. Reflect and Add: Examine every pixel in the `input_grid` at coordinate (`r`, `c`) with color `pixel_color`.
   - If `pixel_color` is not the background color (0) AND (`r`, `c`) is *not* one of the `marker_pixels`:
     - Calculate the reflected coordinates: `r_reflected = 2 * center_coord.row - r`, `c_reflected = 2 * center_coord.col - c`.
     - Check if (`r_reflected`, `c_reflected`) are valid coordinates within the bounds of the `output_grid`.
     - If the reflected coordinates are valid, set the color of the `output_grid` at (`r_reflected`, `c_reflected`) to `pixel_color`.
4. Return Result: The final `output_grid` is the result of the transformation.
