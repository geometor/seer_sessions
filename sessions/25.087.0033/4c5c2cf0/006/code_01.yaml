task_context:
  description: Performs a point reflection of specific objects across the center of a unique marker object, preserving both originals and adding reflections.
  grid_size_varies: Yes (demonstrated by 14x14 and 12x12 examples)
  background_color: 0 (white)

input_features:
  objects:
    - identifier: Center Marker
      description: A unique 5-pixel object consisting of a central pixel and its four diagonal neighbors, all having the same non-background color. It defines the point of reflection.
      attributes:
        shape: 5-pixel diagonal cross (or visually similar like the L-shape in Ex1 which fits the diagonal neighbor rule)
        size: Exactly 5 pixels.
        color: Varies (Green, Yellow, Azure shown).
        uniqueness: Exactly one such object exists per input grid.
        center_pixel: The coordinates (r_c, c_c) of the central pixel of this marker.
        marker_pixels: The set of 5 coordinates belonging to this object.
    - identifier: Reflected Objects
      description: All other non-background pixels/objects in the input grid that are not part of the Center Marker.
      attributes:
        shape: Varies.
        size: Varies.
        color: Varies.
        count: Includes all non-background pixels not in `marker_pixels`.

transformations:
  - action: Identify Center Marker
    description: Scan the input grid to find the unique 5-pixel Center Marker object. Record its center coordinates (r_c, c_c) and the set of its 5 pixel coordinates (`marker_pixels`).
    outputs: center_coord, marker_pixels
  - action: Initialize Output Grid
    description: Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
    outputs: output_grid
  - action: Add Reflections
    description: Iterate through each pixel (r, c) and its color `c_orig` in the input grid. If `c_orig` is not the background color (0) AND the coordinate (r, c) is not in `marker_pixels`:
      1. Calculate the reflected coordinate (r', c') = (2*r_c - r, 2*c_c - c).
      2. Check if (r', c') is within the grid boundaries.
      3. If within bounds, update the `output_grid` at position (r', c') with the color `c_orig`.
    inputs: input_grid, center_coord, marker_pixels, output_grid
    modifies: output_grid

output_features:
  description: The output grid contains the original Center Marker, the original Reflected Objects, and the point reflections of the Reflected Objects around the Center Marker's center.
