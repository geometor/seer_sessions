task_context:
  description: Reflects specific objects across the center of a marker object.
  grid_size_varies: Yes (e.g., 14x14, 12x12)
  background_color: 0 (white)

input_features:
  objects:
    - identifier: Center Marker Object
      description: A unique 5-pixel object composed of a central pixel and its four diagonal neighbors, all having the same color. This object defines the center of reflection.
      attributes:
        shape: Diagonal cross (X shape, or L shape variant in Ex1)
        size: 5 pixels
        color: Varies (Green in Ex1, Yellow in Ex2, Azure in Ex3)
        uniqueness: Assumed unique in the grid based on shape and composition.
        location: Varies per example.
        center_pixel: The pixel at (r, c) such that grid[r,c], grid[r-1,c-1], grid[r-1,c+1], grid[r+1,c-1], grid[r+1,c+1] all exist and have the same non-background color.
    - identifier: Reflected Objects
      description: All other non-background objects in the input grid that are not part of the Center Marker Object.
      attributes:
        shape: Varies (Plus shape, complex shape, multi-part shape)
        size: Varies
        color: Varies (Azure in Ex1, Red in Ex2, Blue in Ex3)
        count: Can be one or more distinct objects (implicitly, all pixels not part of the Center Marker).

transformations:
  - action: Identify Center
    description: Locate the Center Marker Object and determine its central pixel coordinate (r_c, c_c). Also identify all 5 pixels belonging to the Center Marker Object.
  - action: Copy Input
    description: Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid. This preserves the Center Marker Object and the original positions of the Reflected Objects.
  - action: Reflect Pixels
    description: For every pixel (r, c) in the input grid that belongs to a Reflected Object (i.e., non-background and not part of the Center Marker Object):
      1. Calculate the point reflection coordinate (r', c') = (2*r_c - r, 2*c_c - c).
      2. If (r', c') is within the grid boundaries, set the pixel color in the output grid at (r', c') to the color of the input pixel at (r, c).
    preserves_original: Yes (handled by the initial copy)
    preserves_marker: Yes (handled by the initial copy and the condition in Reflect Pixels)

output_features:
  description: The output grid contains the original Center Marker Object, the original Reflected Objects, and the point reflections of the Reflected Objects around the center of the Center Marker Object.
  modifications: Addition of reflected pixels. Overlapping pixels take the color of the last write (which will be the reflected color if overlap occurs, but typically reflections don't overlap originals unless the object passes through the center).
