**General Assessment**

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a 5-pixel diagonal cross ('x' shape) as a reflector and then performing a point reflection of other non-background pixels through the center of this reflector.

The code successfully identifies the reflector and calculates the reflection coordinates. However, the results show that the transformation is not correctly applied. In all examples, the `Transformed Output` differs significantly from the `Expected Output`. The primary issue appears to be in how the output grid is constructed. The current logic copies the input grid and then overwrites pixels at the reflected coordinates. This leads to two problems:
1.  Original pixels that happen to lie on a reflection target location are erased.
2.  Only the reflected image is drawn for the reflected pixels, not the original pixels themselves (unless they are overwritten by another reflection).

The `Expected Output` consistently shows the original reflector, the original non-reflector shapes/pixels, *and* the reflections of those shapes/pixels.

The strategy to resolve this is to modify the output grid construction:
1.  Initialize the output grid with the background color (0).
2.  Identify the reflector and copy *only* its pixels to the output grid.
3.  Iterate through the input grid. For any non-background pixel *not* part of the reflector, place its color at *both* its original location and its calculated reflected location (if within bounds) in the output grid.

Let's analyze Example 1 in detail to confirm the reflection center and coordinates.

The metrics confirm:
*   The reflector identification (`find_diagonal_reflector`) works correctly for all examples.
*   The reflection coordinate calculation is correct (checked manually and via code for one pixel).
*   The set of pixels that *should* be reflected (non-background, non-reflector) includes all colored pixels outside the 'x' shape. In Example 1, there are 7 such pixels forming the azure 'L'.

The failure originates solely from the step `output_np[r_prime, c_prime] = color_to_reflect` which only places the reflected pixel, overwriting any pre-existing pixel (including originals) at that location, and doesn't explicitly preserve the original pixel at `(r, c)` unless it's overwritten by another reflection.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_description: Perform a point reflection of specific objects through the center of a unique marker object, preserving both the original objects and their reflections.

definitions:
  background_color: 0 (white)
  reflector_object:
    shape: 5-pixel diagonal cross ('x' shape)
    property: Composed of 5 pixels of the same non-background color. A central pixel and its four diagonal neighbors.
    role: Defines the center of reflection. Remains unchanged in the output.
    occurrence: Exactly one per input grid.
  reflected_object:
    definition: Any non-background pixel that is not part of the reflector_object.
    role: These pixels are subject to the reflection transformation.
  point_reflection:
    center: The coordinate (r_c, c_c) of the central pixel of the reflector_object.
    formula: For an input pixel at (r, c), the reflected coordinate (r', c') is calculated as r' = 2 * r_c - r and c' = 2 * c_c - c.
    condition: The reflection is only placed if (r', c') is within the grid boundaries.

transformation_steps:
  - step: Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background_color (0).
  - step: Identify the reflector_object in the input grid, including its 5 pixel coordinates and its center coordinate (r_c, c_c).
  - step: Copy the 5 pixels of the reflector_object from their input coordinates to the same coordinates in the output grid.
  - step: Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.
  - step: Check if the pixel at (r, c) is a reflected_object (i.e., non-background color and not part of the reflector_object).
  - step: If it is a reflected_object:
      action_1: Copy the color of the input pixel at (r, c) to the output grid at the same coordinate (r, c).
      action_2: Calculate the reflected coordinate (r', c') using the point_reflection formula with center (r_c, c_c).
      action_3: If the calculated coordinate (r', c') is within the bounds of the grid:
          action_3a: Copy the color of the input pixel at (r, c) to the output grid at the reflected coordinate (r', c').

output: The final output grid contains the reflector_object, the original reflected_objects, and their point reflections.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid to find the unique 5-pixel diagonal cross ('x' shape) made of a single non-background color. This is the 'reflector'. Note the coordinates of its 5 pixels and the coordinate of its central pixel (the 'center of reflection').
3.  Copy the 5 pixels of the reflector from the input grid to the same coordinates in the output grid.
4.  Iterate through every pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.
5.  If the pixel at `(r, c)` has a non-background color *and* is *not* one of the 5 pixels belonging to the reflector:
    a. Let the color of this pixel be `C`.
    b. Set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** to `C` (preserving the original pixel).
    c. Calculate the coordinates `(r', c')` resulting from a point reflection of `(r, c)` through the reflector's center coordinate `(r_c, c_c)` using the formulas: `r' = 2 * r_c - r` and `c' = 2 * c_c - c`.
    d. Check if the calculated coordinate `(r', c')` is within the bounds of the grid.
    e. If `(r', c')` is within the grid bounds, set the color of the pixel at `(r', c')` in the **output grid** to `C` (adding the reflected pixel).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
