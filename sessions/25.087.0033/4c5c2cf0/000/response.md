*   **Perception:** The task involves identifying two distinct objects within an input grid. One object consistently resembles a 5-pixel 'plus' sign, acting as a center point for reflection. The second object varies in shape and color. The transformation preserves the original objects and adds a new object, which is a reflection of the second object through the center of the 'plus' sign object.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_manipulation
    input_features:
      - object_count: 2 (non-white)
      - object_types:
          - name: reflector
            shape: 5-pixel plus sign (+)
            property: has a unique center pixel
          - name: reflected_object
            shape: variable
            color: variable (non-white, different from reflector)
      - background: white (color 0)
    transformation:
      - action: identify_objects
        target: non-white pixels
        result: two distinct objects (reflector, reflected_object)
      - action: find_center
        target: reflector object
        result: coordinates of the center pixel (r_c, c_c)
      - action: copy_grid
        source: input grid
        target: output grid
      - action: reflect_pixels
        target: pixels of reflected_object (r, c)
        parameters:
          center_point: (r_c, c_c)
          reflection_type: point reflection (r' = 2*r_c - r, c' = 2*c_c - c)
        result: coordinates of reflected pixels (r', c')
      - action: draw_pixels
        target: output grid
        parameters:
          coordinates: reflected pixel coordinates (r', c')
          color: color of reflected_object
    output_features:
      - includes: original input objects
      - includes: a new object, which is the reflection of the 'reflected_object' through the center of the 'reflector' object.
    relationships:
      - The 'reflector' object defines the point of symmetry for the reflection.
      - The 'reflected_object' is the shape that undergoes reflection.
      - The added object in the output is geometrically related to the 'reflected_object' and the 'reflector' object via point reflection.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all contiguous groups of non-white pixels in the input grid. There will be exactly two such objects.
    2.  Determine which object is the 'reflector' object (a 5-pixel plus shape) and which is the 'reflected' object (the other shape).
    3.  Find the coordinates (row `r_c`, column `c_c`) of the center pixel of the 'reflector' object. This is the pixel within the plus shape that has four adjacent neighbours of the same color.
    4.  Create the output grid initially as an identical copy of the input grid.
    5.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` that belongs to the 'reflected' object.
    6.  For each such pixel, calculate its corresponding reflected coordinates `(r', c')` using the point reflection formula: `r' = 2 * r_c - r` and `c' = 2 * c_c - c`.
    7.  Set the pixel at coordinates `(r', c')` in the output grid to the color of the 'reflected' object.
    8.  The final output grid contains the original two objects plus the newly drawn reflected object.
