One object consistently resembles a 5-pixel 'plus' sign, acting as a center point for reflection. The second object varies in shape and color. The transformation preserves the original objects and adds a new object, which is a reflection of the second object through the center of the 'plus' sign object.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Determine which object is the 'reflector' object (a 5-pixel plus shape) and which is the 'reflected' object (the other shape).\n    3.  Find the coordinates (row `r_c`, column `c_c`) of the center pixel of the 'reflector' object. This is the pixel within the plus shape that has four adjacent neighbours of the same color.\n    4.  Create the output grid initially as an identical copy of the input grid.\n    5.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` that belongs to the 'reflected' object.\n    6.  For each such pixel, calculate its corresponding reflected coordinates `(r', c')` using the point reflection formula: `r' = 2 * r_c - r` and `c' = 2 * c_c - c`.\n    7.  Set the pixel at coordinates `(r', c')` in the output grid to the color of the 'reflected' object.\n    8.  The final output grid contains the original two objects plus the newly drawn reflected object."
