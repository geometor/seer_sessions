            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a 5-pixel 'plus' shape as a reflector and another object to be reflected through the center of the plus. However, the execution results show that the code fails to produce the correct output for all three training examples. The transformed output is identical to the input in each case.\n\nThe primary reasons for failure appear to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Reflector Center Identification:** The logic in `find_plus_center` to identify the center pixel by checking if it has 4 neighbors *within the object* using cardinal adjacency is flawed. This check fails for the plus shapes in Examples 1 and 3. A plus shape's center pixel has 4 neighbors that *belong* to the plus shape, but they are not necessarily adjacent *to the center pixel* in the object's coordinate set if using 4-connectivity for object definition (e.g., the diagonal neighbors aren't checked). More fundamentally, the check `neighbor_count == 4` is specifically for a filled 3x3 square's center, not a plus sign. A more robust method is needed, perhaps by checking the relative coordinates of the 5 pixels.\n2.  **Handling of Multiple Objects/Pixels:** The code assumes exactly one object is the reflector and exactly one *other* object is reflected (`if len(objects) != 2:` and selecting only the first non-reflector). Example 2 shows multiple disconnected groups of pixels of the same color (red) that all need to be reflected. The reflection should apply to *all* pixels that are not part of the background (white) and not part of the identified reflector object.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Reflector Identification:** Modify `find_plus_center` (or create a new function) to correctly identify the 5-pixel cardinal plus shape and its unique center pixel. This can be done by finding a 5-pixel object and checking if its coordinates match the pattern `{(r, c), (r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), (r, c-1)}` for some `(r, c)`.\n2.  **Refine Reflected Pixel Identification:** Instead of finding a single 'reflected object', identify the reflector object first. Then, iterate through *all* pixels in the input grid. If a pixel is not background (color 0) and does not belong to the reflector object, apply the point reflection transformation using its coordinates and color.\n3.  **Implement Reflection:** Apply the point reflection formula `r' = 2*r_c - r`, `c' = 2*c_c - c` for every identified pixel to be reflected, where `(r_c, c_c)` is the center of the reflector. Draw the result onto the output grid, making sure to handle boundary conditions.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\nLet's verify the assumptions about the reflector shape, center, and the pixels being reflected.\n\n"

Let's re-run that part mentally for Ex 1:\n*   Green pixels: (6,4), (6,6), (7,5), (8,4), (8,6). Are they 4-connected?\n    *   (7,5) connects to nothing else green via Up/Down/Left/Right.\n    *   (6,4) connects to nothing else green.\n    *   (6,6) connects to nothing else green.\n    *   (8,4) connects to nothing else green.\n    *   (8,6) connects to nothing else green.\n*   The `find_objects` function using 4-connectivity will find 5 separate green objects, each of size 1.\n*   The `find_reflector_and_center_diagonal` function looks for objects of `size == 5`, so it never finds the reflector candidates.\n\n**Revised Understanding 3.0:**\n\n1.  **Object Definition:** The concept of \"object\" as a 4-connected group might be misleading for identifying the reflector. The reflector is defined by its specific 5-pixel shape ('x' shape) and color, regardless of 4-connectivity between its pixels.\n2.  **Reflector Identification:** We need a different approach. Instead of finding connected objects first, perhaps iterate through all pixels. If a pixel `(r, c)` is non-background, check if it could be the center of a diagonal plus of the *same color*. That is, check if pixels `(r+1, c+1), (r-1, c-1), (r+1, c-1), (r-1, c+1)` exist, are within bounds, and have the same color as `(r, c)`. If such a center `(r_c, c_c)` and its 4 diagonal neighbors are found, this 5-pixel group is the reflector. Store its coordinates and center.\n3.  **Reflected Pixels:** All pixels that are not background (white) and *not* part of the identified 5 reflector pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** Point reflection using `r' = 2*r_c - r`, `c' = 2*c_c - c`. The output grid starts as a copy of the input. For each reflected pixel `(r', c')` calculated, overwrite the pixel at that location in the output grid with the *original color* of the pixel that was reflected.\n\nLet's verify this logic conceptually:\n*   Example 1: Scan grid. Find green pixel at (7,5). Check diagonal neighbors: (8,6), (6,4), (8,4), (6,6). All are green. Found reflector center (7,5), color green, coords {(7,5), (8,6), (6,4), (8,4), (6,6)}. All other non-white pixels (the azure ones) get reflected through (7,5). This matches the expected output structure.\n*   Example 2: Scan grid. Find yellow pixel at (8,7). Check diagonals: (9,8), (7,6), (9,6), (7,8). All yellow. Found reflector center (8,7), color yellow. All red pixels get reflected through (8,7). Matches.\n*   Example 3: Scan grid. Find azure pixel at (7,5). Check diagonals: (8,6), (6,4), (8,4), (6,6). All azure. Found reflector center (7,5), color azure. All blue pixels get reflected through (7,5). Matches.\n\nThis revised approach seems robust.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"

Identify all pixels_to_reflect (coordinates (r, c) and color).\n    4. For each pixel_to_reflect at (r, c) with color `col`:\n       a.

Calculate the coordinates `(r', c')` resulting from a point reflection of `(r, c)` through the reflector's center coordinate `(r_c, c_c)` using the formulas: `r' = 2 * r_c - r` and `c' = 2 * c_c - c`.\n    c.
