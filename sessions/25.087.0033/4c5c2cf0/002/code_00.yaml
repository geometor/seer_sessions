task_description: Reflects non-reflector pixels through the center of a 5-pixel diagonal cross ('x' shape) reflector.

definitions:
  grid: A 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  pixel: A single cell in the grid.
  background_color: 0 (white).
  reflector:
    definition: A specific 5-pixel shape acting as the center of reflection.
    shape: A diagonal cross ('x' shape), consisting of a center pixel and its four diagonal neighbors.
    property: All 5 pixels must have the same non-background color.
    uniqueness: Assumed to be unique in each input grid based on examples.
  reflector_center: The central pixel of the 5-pixel 'x' shape.
  pixels_to_reflect:
    definition: All pixels in the input grid that are not the background color and are not part of the reflector.
    property: These pixels retain their original color when reflected.

transformation:
  action: Point reflection.
  center_of_reflection: The reflector_center coordinate (r_c, c_c).
  process:
    1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2. Identify the 5 pixels forming the reflector 'x' shape and its center (r_c, c_c).
    3. Identify all pixels_to_reflect (coordinates (r, c) and color).
    4. For each pixel_to_reflect at (r, c) with color `col`:
       a. Calculate the reflected coordinates: r' = 2 * r_c - r, c' = 2 * c_c - c.
       b. If the reflected coordinates (r', c') are within the grid boundaries:
          i. Update the output grid at (r', c') with the color `col`. Note: This overwrites any existing pixel at (r', c'), including parts of the original reflector or other original shapes if the reflection lands there.

constraints:
  - Grid size between 1x1 and 30x30.
  - Exactly one 5-pixel 'x' shape reflector exists.
