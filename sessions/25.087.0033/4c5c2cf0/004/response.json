            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a 5-pixel diagonal cross ('x' shape) as a reflector and then performing a point reflection of other non-background pixels through the center of this reflector.\n\nThe code successfully identifies the reflector and calculates the reflection coordinates. However, the results show that the transformation is not correctly applied. In all examples, the `Transformed Output` differs significantly from the `Expected Output`. The primary issue appears to be in how the output grid is constructed. The current logic copies the input grid and then overwrites pixels at the reflected coordinates. This leads to two problems:\n1.  Original pixels that happen to lie on a reflection target location are erased.\n2.  Only the reflected image is drawn for the reflected pixels, not the original pixels themselves (unless they are overwritten by another reflection).\n\nThe `Expected Output` consistently shows the original reflector, the original non-reflector shapes/pixels, *and* the reflections of those shapes/pixels.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to modify the output grid construction:\n1.  Initialize the output grid with the background color (0).\n2.  Identify the reflector and copy *only* its pixels to the output grid.\n3.  Iterate through the input grid. For any non-background pixel *not* part of the reflector, place its color at *both* its original location and its calculated reflected location (if within bounds) in the output grid.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's analyze Example 1 in detail to confirm the reflection center and coordinates.\n"
