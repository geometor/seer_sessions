task_description: Perform a point reflection of specific objects through the center of a unique marker object, preserving both the original objects and their reflections.

definitions:
  background_color: 0 (white)
  reflector_object:
    shape: 5-pixel diagonal cross ('x' shape)
    property: Composed of 5 pixels of the same non-background color. A central pixel and its four diagonal neighbors.
    role: Defines the center of reflection. Remains unchanged in the output.
    occurrence: Exactly one per input grid.
  reflected_object:
    definition: Any non-background pixel that is not part of the reflector_object.
    role: These pixels are subject to the reflection transformation.
  point_reflection:
    center: The coordinate (r_c, c_c) of the central pixel of the reflector_object.
    formula: For an input pixel at (r, c), the reflected coordinate (r', c') is calculated as r' = 2 * r_c - r and c' = 2 * c_c - c.
    condition: The reflection is only placed if (r', c') is within the grid boundaries.

transformation_steps:
  - step: Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background_color (0).
  - step: Identify the reflector_object in the input grid, including its 5 pixel coordinates and its center coordinate (r_c, c_c).
  - step: Copy the 5 pixels of the reflector_object from their input coordinates to the same coordinates in the output grid.
  - step: Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.
  - step: Check if the pixel at (r, c) is a reflected_object (i.e., non-background color and not part of the reflector_object).
  - step: If it is a reflected_object:
      action_1: Copy the color of the input pixel at (r, c) to the output grid at the same coordinate (r, c).
      action_2: Calculate the reflected coordinate (r', c') using the point_reflection formula with center (r_c, c_c).
      action_3: If the calculated coordinate (r', c') is within the bounds of the grid:
          action_3a: Copy the color of the input pixel at (r, c) to the output grid at the reflected coordinate (r', c').

output: The final output grid contains the reflector_object, the original reflected_objects, and their point reflections.
