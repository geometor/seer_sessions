*   **Perception:** The input grids contain multiple solid-colored rectangular objects placed on a white background. The output grid is always a solid rectangle of a single color. The color and dimensions of the output rectangle correspond to one of the rectangles present in the input grid. Specifically, the output rectangle consistently matches the color and dimensions of the *smallest* rectangular object found in the input grid, where "smallest" is determined by area (height * width).

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Identify the smallest solid-colored rectangular object in the input grid and create an output grid of the same dimensions filled with that object's color.
    
    elements:
      - element: grid
        role: input_output
        description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9).
      - element: background
        value: 0 (white)
        description: The background color of the grid.
      - element: object
        description: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-background color. In these examples, all objects are solid rectangles.
        properties:
          - color: The color (1-9) of the pixels forming the object.
          - shape: Rectangular.
          - bounding_box: The minimum and maximum row and column indices enclosing the object.
          - dimensions: height and width derived from the bounding box.
          - area: height * width.
    
    relationships:
      - relationship: identification
        description: Each input grid contains multiple distinct rectangular objects.
      - relationship: comparison
        property: area
        description: The areas of the bounding boxes of all non-background objects are compared.
      - relationship: selection
        criterion: minimum area
        description: The object with the smallest bounding box area is selected.
      - relationship: transformation
        input: selected object
        output: output grid
        description: The output grid's dimensions (height and width) and color match those of the selected object (the one with the minimum area). The output grid is filled entirely with this color.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    2.  For each identified object, determine its color and its bounding box dimensions (height and width).
    3.  Calculate the area (height * width) for each object's bounding box.
    4.  Find the object that has the minimum calculated area. If there's a tie for the minimum area, any one of the tied objects can be chosen (based on the examples, there are no ties, but this is a potential edge case).
    5.  Create a new grid whose height and width match the height and width of the bounding box of the minimum-area object found in step 4.
    6.  Fill the entire new grid with the color of the minimum-area object.
    7.  Return the newly created and filled grid as the output.
