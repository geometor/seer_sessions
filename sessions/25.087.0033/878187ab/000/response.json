            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Analysis:** The input grids consist primarily of a single background color (orange - 7). Scattered within this background are a few single pixels of other colors (magenta - 6 and azure - 8 in the first example; yellow - 4 and gray - 5 in the second). The grid sizes differ between examples (16x16 and 15x15).\n2.  **Output Analysis:** The output grids also have an orange (7) background. They feature a distinct geometric pattern composed of red (2) and yellow (4) pixels located in the bottom-left corner. The rest of the grid is filled with the background color. The size and specific structure of this pattern vary between the examples. The output grid dimensions also sometimes differ from the input dimensions (16x16 output for 16x16 input; 16x15 output for 15x15 input).\n3.  **Transformation Hypothesis:** The transformation seems conditional. If the input grid contains *any* pixel that is not the background color (orange - 7), a specific process is triggered. This process involves:\n    *   Creating an output grid, potentially resizing it (the height seems to be at least 16, while the width matches the input).\n    *   Filling the output grid with the background color (orange - 7).\n    *   Determining the dimensions (specifically, the width) of a pattern based on the *input grid's width*.\n    *   Drawing a predefined 5-row high pattern using red (2) and yellow (4) pixels in the bottom-left corner of the output grid. The exact structure of the pattern depends on its calculated width. The yellow pixels form diagonal lines originating from the bottom corners.\n    *   If the input grid consists *only* of the background color, the output is likely identical to the input (though this case isn't shown in the examples).\n4.  **Pattern Details:** The pattern is always 5 rows high. Its width (`PW`) changes: 10 for input width 16, and 7 for input width 15. The pattern uses red (2) as the main color and yellow (4) for specific diagonal elements. For a pattern cell at relative row `pr` (0-4) and relative column `pc` (0 to `PW-1`), the color is yellow (4) if `pc == 4 - pr` or `pc == (PW - 1) - (4 - pr)`, and red (2) otherwise.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Determine the most frequent pixel color and designate it as the `background_color` (likely orange, 7). Check if any pixels in the grid have a color different from the `background_color`.\n2.  **Check Condition:** If all pixels in the input grid are the `background_color`, the transformation is complete, and the output grid is identical to the input grid. Proceed to step 7.\n3.  **Prepare Output Grid:** If there are non-`background_color` pixels in the input:\n    a.  Get the input grid's height (`H`) and width (`W`).\n    b.  Determine the output grid dimensions: `output_H = max(16, H)`, `output_W = W`.\n    c.  Create a new grid of size `output_H` x `output_W`.\n    d.  Fill this new grid entirely with the `background_color`.\n4.  **Determine Pattern Width:** Based on the input width `W`, determine the pattern width `PW`. Use the following mapping (or find a general rule if more examples are provided):\n    *   If `W` = 16, then `PW` = 10.\n    *   If `W` = 15, then `PW` = 7.\n    *   (Assume other widths might map to other pattern widths).\n5.  **Define Pattern:** The pattern has a fixed height of `pattern_H = 5` and width `PW`. The pattern uses two colors: red (2) and yellow (4).\n6.  **Draw Pattern:** Iterate through the region in the output grid corresponding to the pattern's location. This region spans rows from `output_H - pattern_H` to `output_H - 1` (inclusive) and columns from 0 to `PW - 1` (inclusive). For each cell `(r, c)` in this output grid region:\n    a.  Calculate the relative pattern row index: `pr = r - (output_H - pattern_H)`.\n    b.  Calculate the relative pattern column index: `pc = c`.\n    c.  Check if the pattern cell `(pr, pc)` should be yellow: This occurs if `pc == (pattern_H - 1) - pr` OR `pc == (PW - 1) - ((pattern_H - 1) - pr)`. (Simplified: `pc == 4 - pr` OR `pc == PW - 5 + pr`).\n    d.  If the condition in step 6c is true, set the output grid pixel at `(r, c)` to yellow (4).\n    e.  Otherwise, set the output grid pixel at `(r, c)` to red (2).\n7.  **Final Output:** The resulting grid is the final output."
