## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code successfully transformed Example 1 but failed on Example 2. The failure report for Example 2 indicates `Match: False`, `Size Correct: False`, and `Color Count Correct: False`. This strongly suggests that the assumptions about the output grid dimensions, specifically the height, were incorrect or incomplete. The pattern drawing logic seems correct for Example 1, and the conditional execution (only draw if non-background colors are present) also appears valid.

**Strategy:**
1.  Re-analyze the input and output dimensions for all examples.
2.  Use `tool_code` to extract precise dimensions for inputs and outputs.
3.  Formulate a revised hypothesis for determining the output grid dimensions based on the input grid dimensions.
4.  Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect the corrected understanding, particularly regarding output size determination.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Define Background:** Identify the background color as orange (7).
2.  **Analyze Input:** Get the input grid dimensions (H, W). Check if any pixel has a color different from orange (7).
3.  **Conditional Execution:**
    *   **If** all pixels in the input grid are orange: Return the input grid unchanged.
    *   **If** at least one pixel is *not* orange: Proceed to the output generation steps.
4.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**
    *   Set the output width (`output_W`) equal to the input width (W).
    *   Set the output height (`output_H`) to be the maximum of 16 and the input height (H). (`output_H = max(16, H)`).
5.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid of size `output_H` x `output_W`, completely filled with the background color (orange, 7).
6.  **Calculate Pattern Width (PW):**
    *   Based on the output width (`output_W`):
        *   If `output_W` is even, `PW = output_W - 6`.
        *   If `output_W` is odd, `PW = output_W - 8`.
    *   Ensure PW is at least 1 (`PW = max(1, PW)`).
7.  **Define Pattern Properties:** The pattern to be drawn has a fixed height of 5 rows and the calculated width PW. It uses red (2) and yellow (4) colors.
8.  **Define Pattern Region:** The pattern region is located at the bottom-left of the output grid, spanning rows from `output_H - 5` to `output_H - 1` (inclusive) and columns from `0` to `PW - 1` (inclusive).
9.  **Draw Pattern:**
    *   Iterate through each cell within the `5 x PW` pattern region using relative coordinates `pr` (pattern row, 0 to 4) and `pc` (pattern column, 0 to PW-1).
    *   For each cell (`pr`, `pc`):
        *   Calculate the corresponding absolute coordinates (`r`, `c`) in the output grid: `r = output_H - 5 + pr`, `c = pc`.
        *   Determine the color:
            *   Set the color to yellow (4) if `pc == 4 - pr` (diagonal from top-left of pattern) OR `pc == (PW - 1) - (4 - pr)` (diagonal from top-right of pattern).
            *   Otherwise, set the color to red (2).
        *   Place the determined color at the output grid cell (`r`, `c`).
10. **Return Output:** Return the generated output grid containing the background and the drawn pattern.
