**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with integer values representing colors.
2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), and green (3). White is the background color. Azure pixels appear in the input and persist in the output. Green pixels appear only in the output.
3.  **Objects:** The azure pixels can be considered as distinct points or objects within the grid.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves adding green pixels to the grid based on the positions of the azure pixels.
5.  **Pattern:** Green pixels form straight lines (horizontal or vertical) connecting pairs of azure pixels that lie on the same row or column.
6.  **Connectivity:** The green lines fill the space *between* the pairs of aligned azure pixels, excluding the azure pixels themselves.
7.  **Conditions:** Lines are only drawn between pairs of azure pixels. If an azure pixel has no other azure pixel in its row or column, no line emanates from it in that direction. If the space between two aligned azure pixels is not white (0), it appears those pixels are not changed to green (though all examples show only white pixels being changed).

**YAML Facts:**

  modifications: Addition of green pixels based on alignment checks.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the coordinates (row, column) of all pixels with the color azure (8) in the input grid.
3.  Consider every possible unique pair of these azure pixel coordinates.
4.  For each pair of azure pixels:
    a.  Check if they are in the same row. If they are, iterate through all the pixels located horizontally strictly between them. If any of these intermediate pixels are currently white (0) in the output grid, change their color to green (3).
    b.  Check if they are in the same column. If they are, iterate through all the pixels located vertically strictly between them. If any of these intermediate pixels are currently white (0) in the output grid, change their color to green (3).
5.  The final modified grid is the result.
