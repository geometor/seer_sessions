task_description: Fill the path between pairs of azure pixels aligned horizontally or vertically with green pixels.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  value_range: 0-9
  background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: point
    color: 8 (azure)
    role: marker
  - type: segment
    color: 3 (green)
    role: connector
relationships:
  - type: alignment
    between: pairs of azure pixels
    properties:
      - same_row
      - same_column
actions:
  - name: find_pixels
    input: grid
    parameters:
      color: 8 (azure)
    output: list_of_coordinates
  - name: iterate_pairs
    input: list_of_coordinates
    action: For each unique pair of coordinates ((r1, c1), (r2, c2))...
  - name: check_alignment_and_fill
    condition: If r1 == r2 (same row)
    action: Iterate column c from min(c1, c2) + 1 to max(c1, c2) - 1. If grid[r1, c] is 0 (white), set grid[r1, c] to 3 (green).

    condition: If c1 == c2 (same column)
    action: Iterate row r from min(r1, r2) + 1 to max(r1, r2) - 1. If grid[r, c1] is 0 (white), set grid[r, c1] to 3 (green).
