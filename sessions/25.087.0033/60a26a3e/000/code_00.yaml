task_elements:
  - item: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - background_color: White (0)

  - item: Objects
    properties:
      - type: PlusSign
      - color: Red (2)
      - structure: A 3x3 area where the center and its 4 orthogonal neighbors are Red (2), and the 4 diagonal neighbors can be any color (usually White (0) in examples).
      - identification: Locate the center Red (2) pixel which has 4 orthogonal Red (2) neighbors.
      - key_property: Center coordinates (row, col)

  - item: Relationships
    properties:
      - type: Pairwise Alignment
        between: Centers of PlusSign objects
        conditions:
          - Same row (horizontal alignment)
          - Same column (vertical alignment)
      - type: Path Between Centers
        properties:
          - Pixels on the straight line segment strictly between the centers of an aligned pair.
          - condition: All pixels on the path must be White (0).

  - item: Actions
    properties:
      - type: Color Change
        target: White (0) pixels identified on a valid Path Between Centers.
        new_color: Blue (1)
      - type: Copy Grid
        details: All pixels not undergoing a color change retain their original color from the input grid.
