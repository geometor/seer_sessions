Each plus sign seems to be composed of 5 red pixels: a central pixel and its four orthogonal neighbors.\n3.  **Output Grid:** Largely identical to the input grid, but with the addition of blue (1) pixels.\n4.  **Blue Pixels:** These appear exclusively on the straight line path *between* pairs of red plus signs.\n5.  **Conditions for Blue Pixels:** Blue lines only form between plus signs that:\n    *   Are aligned either perfectly horizontally or perfectly vertically.\n    *   Have a path between their centers consisting solely of white (0) pixels.\n6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying these specific pairs of red plus signs and \"connecting\" their centers by changing the intervening white pixels to blue.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
