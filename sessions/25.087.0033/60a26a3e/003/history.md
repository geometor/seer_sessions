"""
Identifies "Red Plus Signs" (a central Red pixel with four orthogonal Red neighbors) in the input grid. 
For every pair of identified Plus Sign centers, it checks if they are aligned horizontally or vertically. 
If they are aligned and the straight path between their centers (excluding the centers themselves) consists entirely of White pixels in the input grid, 
it changes those White pixels to Blue in the output grid. The rest of the output grid remains identical to the input grid.
