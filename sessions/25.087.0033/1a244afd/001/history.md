Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are rectangular grids of pixels with different colors. The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output.
2.  **Colors Involved:**
    *   **Azure (8):** Acts as the background color, largely unchanged.
    *   **Blue (1):** Appears in the input and persists in the same location in the output.
    *   **Magenta (6):** Appears in the input but is removed (replaced by azure) in the output.
    *   **Orange (7):** Does not appear in the input but appears in the output.
3.  **Key Interaction:** There seems to be a relationship between the locations of blue (1) pixels and magenta (6) pixels in the input, which dictates where the new orange (7) pixels appear in the output.
4.  **Spatial Relationship:**
    *   For each blue pixel in the input, there appears to be a corresponding magenta pixel located either in the same row or the same column.
    *   The magenta pixel acts as a directional indicator relative to the blue pixel. If the magenta pixel is `d` units away (horizontally or vertically) from the blue pixel, an orange pixel appears `d` units away from the blue pixel, but rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    *   Specifically, if a magenta pixel is at `(r_m, c_m)` and its corresponding blue pixel is at `(r_b, c_b)`, let `dr = r_m - r_b` and `dc = c_m - c_b`. The orange pixel appears at `(r_b - dc, c_b + dr)`.
5.  **Boundary Condition:** If the calculated position for the orange pixel falls outside the grid boundaries, no orange pixel is placed for that specific blue-magenta pair (as seen in train_3).
6.  **Transformation Summary:** Magenta pixels are essentially 'consumed' to create orange pixels at a transformed relative location from their associated blue pixel, provided the target location is valid. Blue pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Transform a grid by relocating magenta pixels based on their relative position to blue pixels, changing their color to orange and rotating the relative position vector by -90 degrees."
grid_properties:

  - object_type: marker
    color: 1 # blue
    behavior: static, acts as an anchor point for transformation
  - object_type: indicator
    color: 6 # magenta
    behavior: indicates direction relative to a blue pixel, removed in output
  - object_type: result
    color: 7 # orange
    behavior: appears in output at a calculated position based on blue/magenta pairs
relationships:
  - type: spatial_alignment
    object1: blue (1) pixel
    object2: magenta (6) pixel
    details: "Each blue pixel is associated with exactly one magenta pixel located in the same row or same column."
transformations:
  - action: identify_pairs
    input_objects: blue (1), magenta (6)
    condition: "Find pairs where blue pixel at (r_b, c_b) and magenta pixel at (r_m, c_m) satisfy r_b == r_m OR c_b == c_m."
  - action: calculate_delta
    input_objects: paired blue (r_b, c_b), magenta (r_m, c_m)
    output: vector (dr, dc) where dr = r_m - r_b, dc = c_m - c_b
  - action: calculate_target_position
    input: blue position (r_b, c_b), delta vector (dr, dc)
    output: orange position (r_o, c_o) where r_o = r_b - dc, c_o = c_b + dr
  - action: place_pixel
    target_grid: output
    position: (r_o, c_o)
    color: 7 # orange
    condition: "(r_o, c_o) must be within grid boundaries."
  - action: remove_pixel
    target_grid: output
    position: (r_m, c_m) # position of the original magenta pixel
    replacement_color: 8 # azure (background)
    condition: "Magenta pixel was part of a processed pair."
  - action: copy_unmodified
    details: "All pixels not involved in the transformation (original blue pixels, background pixels, magenta pixels without a row/column aligned blue pixel) are copied from input to output, except for the magenta pixels which are removed."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all locations of blue pixels (color 1) and magenta pixels (color 6) in the input grid.
3.  Create lists of coordinates for blue pixels and magenta pixels.
4.  For each blue pixel `B` at coordinates `(r_b, c_b)`:
    a.  Search the list of magenta pixels for a unique magenta pixel `M` at coordinates `(r_m, c_m)` such that either `r_m == r_b` (same row) or `c_m == c_b` (same column).
    b.  If such a unique magenta pixel `M` is found:
        i.  Calculate the row difference `dr = r_m - r_b`.
        ii. Calculate the column difference `dc = c_m - c_b`.
        iii. Calculate the target coordinates `(r_o, c_o)` for the new orange pixel where `r_o = r_b - dc` and `c_o = c_b + dr`.
        iv. Check if the target coordinates `(r_o, c_o)` are within the valid row and column bounds of the grid.
        v.  If the target coordinates are within bounds, change the color of the pixel at `(r_o, c_o)` in the output grid to orange (7).
        vi. Change the color of the pixel at the magenta pixel's original coordinates `(r_m, c_m)` in the output grid to azure (8).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
