            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are rectangular grids of pixels with different colors. The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output.\n2.  **Colors Involved:**\n    *   **Azure (8):** Acts as the background color, largely unchanged.\n    *   **Blue (1):** Appears in the input and persists in the same location in the output.\n    *   **Magenta (6):** Appears in the input but is removed (replaced by azure) in the output.\n    *   **Orange (7):** Does not appear in the input but appears in the output.\n3.  **Key Interaction:** There seems to be a relationship between the locations of blue (1) pixels and magenta (6) pixels in the input, which dictates where the new orange (7) pixels appear in the output.\n4.  **Spatial Relationship:**\n    *   For each blue pixel in the input, there appears to be a corresponding magenta pixel located either in the same row or the same column.\n    *   The magenta pixel acts as a directional indicator relative to the blue pixel. If the magenta pixel is `d` units away (horizontally or vertically) from the blue pixel, an orange pixel appears `d` units away from the blue pixel, but rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n    *   Specifically, if a magenta pixel is at `(r_m, c_m)` and its corresponding blue pixel is at `(r_b, c_b)`, let `dr = r_m - r_b` and `dc = c_m - c_b`. The orange pixel appears at `(r_b - dc, c_b + dr)`.\n5.  **Boundary Condition:** If the calculated position for the orange pixel falls outside the grid boundaries, no orange pixel is placed for that specific blue-magenta pair (as seen in train_3).\n6.  **Transformation Summary:** Magenta pixels are essentially 'consumed' to create orange pixels at a transformed relative location from their associated blue pixel, provided the target location is valid. Blue pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
