Task: Extract, clean, and stack 6x6 patterns from an input grid.

Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Contains a single background color (most frequent color).
    - Contains noise pixels (always gray=5).
    - Contains embedded 6x6 patterns made of various colors.
    - Patterns may contain the background color.
    - Patterns may overlap noise pixels or pixels from other minor colors.

Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Composed of cleaned 6x6 patterns stacked vertically.
    - Width is always 6.
    - Height is 6 * (number of patterns found).
    - Does not contain noise pixels (gray=5).
    - Each pattern contains only its primary color and the background color.

Objects:
  - Background: The most frequent color in the input.
  - Noise: Pixels with the color gray (5).
  - Pattern_Pixel: Any pixel that is not Background and not Noise.
  - Pattern_Component: A connected group (8-way adjacency) of Pattern_Pixels.
  - Raw_Pattern_Area: A 6x6 section of the input grid defined by the bounding box of a Pattern_Component whose bounding box is exactly 6x6.
  - Primary_Color: The most frequent Pattern_Pixel color within a Raw_Pattern_Area.
  - Cleaned_Pattern: A 6x6 grid derived from Raw_Pattern_Area where all pixels not matching the Background or Primary_Color are replaced by the Background color.

Relationships:
  - Pattern_Components define the locations of Raw_Pattern_Areas via their 6x6 bounding boxes.
  - Raw_Pattern_Areas are transformed into Cleaned_Patterns.
  - Cleaned_Patterns are sorted based on the top-left coordinate (row, then column) of their corresponding Raw_Pattern_Area in the input grid.
  - Sorted Cleaned_Patterns are stacked vertically to form the Output_Grid.

Actions:
  - Identify Background color.
  - Identify Noise color (gray=5).
  - Find connected components of Pattern_Pixels.
  - Filter components to keep only those with a 6x6 bounding box.
  - For each valid component:
    - Extract the Raw_Pattern_Area (6x6) from the input grid.
    - Determine the Primary_Color for that area.
    - Generate the Cleaned_Pattern by replacing non-primary, non-background pixels with the Background color.
    - Store the Cleaned_Pattern and its original top-left coordinate.
  - Sort the Cleaned_Patterns by coordinate (row, then column).
  - Vertically concatenate the sorted Cleaned_Patterns.
