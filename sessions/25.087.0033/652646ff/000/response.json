            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are grids of colored pixels. The output grid's width is consistently 6 pixels. The output grid's height is always a multiple of 6.\n2.  **Background Color:** Each input grid has a dominant color that acts as a background (red=2 in train_1, green=3 in train_2, yellow=4 in train_3, azure=8 in train_4). This background color is also present in the output grids.\n3.  **Noise Pixels:** The input grids contain scattered gray pixels (color=5). These gray pixels do not appear in the output grids.\n4.  **Patterns:** The core elements being manipulated are distinct 6x6 pixel patterns embedded within the input grid. These patterns are composed of various colors, often including the background color itself.\n5.  **Pattern Extraction:** The task involves identifying these 6x6 patterns within the input grid.\n6.  **Pattern Cleaning:** Within the identified 6x6 areas in the input, there might be pixels that aren't part of the main pattern color or the background (like the maroon=9 pixel within the yellow=4 pattern area in train_1, or the gray=5 noise pixels). These \"impurity\" pixels are replaced with the background color in the output patterns. Each output pattern seems to consist only of its \"primary\" color and the background color.\n7.  **Composition:** The output grid is formed by stacking these cleaned 6x6 patterns vertically.\n8.  **Ordering:** The order in which the patterns are stacked in the output corresponds to their position in the input grid, scanned row by row, then column by column, based on the top-left corner of each pattern's bounding box.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Note the noise color is gray (5).\n2.  **Identify Pattern Candidates:** Locate all pixels that are neither the background color nor the noise color (gray).\n3.  **Group Candidates:** Group these candidate pixels into connected components using 8-way adjacency (including diagonals).\n4.  **Filter by Size:** For each component, calculate its bounding box. Keep only those components whose bounding box dimensions are exactly 6x6.\n5.  **Extract and Clean:** For each valid 6x6 component found:\n    a.  Record the top-left coordinate (minimum row, minimum column) of its bounding box.\n    b.  Extract the corresponding 6x6 grid area directly from the input grid (this is the `raw_pattern`).\n    c.  Identify the `primary_color` for this `raw_pattern` by finding the most frequent color within it, excluding the background color and the gray noise color.\n    d.  Create a `cleaned_pattern` (a new 6x6 grid): Iterate through each pixel of the `raw_pattern`. If the pixel's color is either the `primary_color` or the background color, copy it to the `cleaned_pattern`. Otherwise, place the background color in the `cleaned_pattern`.\n    e.  Store the `cleaned_pattern` associated with its top-left coordinate.\n6.  **Sort Patterns:** Sort the collected `cleaned_patterns` based on their associated top-left coordinates, primarily by row index and secondarily by column index.\n7.  **Assemble Output:** Create the output grid by vertically stacking the sorted `cleaned_patterns` in order."
