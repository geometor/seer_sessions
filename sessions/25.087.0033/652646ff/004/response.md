**Analysis of Component Sizes:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Target shapes (Yellow, Azure, Green): Sizes 12, 10, 9+1 = 10.
    *   Ignored shapes (Maroon): Sizes 1, 1.
    *   *Result*: The code generated patterns for all 6 components found.
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Target shapes (Yellow, Green): Sizes 12, 8+2=10.
    *   Ignored shapes (Red): Sizes 1, 1.
    *   *Result*: The code generated patterns for Yellow, Red (size 1 at (4,2)), and Green (size 10 at (2,6)). It ignored the Red pixel at (9,7) perhaps due to boundary issues for 6x6 extraction.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Target shapes (Red, Azure, Green): Sizes 9, 9, 10.
    *   Ignored shapes (Orange): Sizes 1, 1, 1.
    *   *Result*: The code generated patterns for Red (size 9 at (2,0)), Orange (size 1 at (4,3)), and Azure (size 9 at (5,3)). It missed the Green shape and used an Orange pixel instead. Why? Sorting is by (min_r, min_c). Red=(2,0), Orange=(4,3), Azure=(5,3). The Green shape starts at (8,6). It seems the code picked the first 3 components based on the sorting order. This suggests a flaw in simply taking all components and sorting.

**Revised Hypotheses & Strategy:**

1.  **Component Filtering**: A size threshold seems necessary. Components with size < ~5 (need to confirm threshold) should be ignored. Let's try ignoring components with size < 5.
    *   Ex 1: Ignores Maroon (size 1). Keeps Yellow, Azure, Green. -> Correct components.
    *   Ex 4: Ignores Red (size 1, 1), keeps Yellow (12), Green (10). -> Correct components.
    *   Ex 3: Ignores Orange (size 1, 1, 1), keeps Red (9), Azure (9), Green (10). -> Correct components.
    *   Ex 2: (Need to run component analysis) Assuming Yellow, Azure, Blue shapes are large enough, this filter seems promising.
2.  **Cleaning Logic**: The `clean_pattern` function appears mostly correct, but let's ensure it explicitly replaces *all* non-primary, non-background colors with the background. This includes Gray (5) and any other colors like Orange (7) in Ex3. The current code iterates and only keeps primary or background. This should be correct. Maybe the issue in Ex3/Ex4 was using the wrong primary color due to incorrect component selection?
3.  **Extraction Point**: Always use the top-left corner `(min_r, min_c)` of the *filtered* component's bounding box as the top-left corner for the 6x6 extraction.
4.  **Sorting**: Sort the resulting *cleaned* 6x6 patterns based on the `(min_r, min_c)` coordinates of the components they were derived from.
5.  **Stacking**: Vertically stack the sorted patterns.

Let's refine the natural language program based on this.

## General Assessment

The initial code correctly identified the core task elements: finding components, extracting 6x6 areas, cleaning, sorting, and stacking. However, it failed on all examples, primarily due to:

1.  **Incorrect Component Selection**: The code processed *all* non-background, non-noise components, including small, isolated pixels (e.g., Maroon in Ex1, Red in Ex4, Orange in Ex3) that should have been ignored. This led to extra, incorrect patterns in the output.
2.  **Incorrect Output Size**: Directly resulting from selecting the wrong number of components.
3.  **Incorrect Pattern Content**:
    *   Sometimes resulted from selecting the wrong component (e.g., using Orange instead of Green in Ex3).
    *   Sometimes the cleaning itself seemed slightly off, potentially because the primary color used for cleaning was derived from a small, incorrect component, or the cleaning logic didn't handle all non-primary/non-background colors correctly within the 6x6 area. The color palettes of the transformed outputs often contained unexpected colors (e.g., 9 in Ex1, 7 in Ex3, 2 in Ex4).

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Implement Component Filtering**: Introduce a filter (e.g., minimum size threshold) to select only the "significant" components that correspond to the patterns in the expected output. Based on analysis, components with fewer than ~5 pixels seem to be ignored.
2.  **Refine Cleaning**: Ensure the cleaning process within the 6x6 extracted area correctly identifies the single "primary color" (from the significant component) and the background color, replacing *all* other pixels (including noise like gray and other stray colors) with the background color.
3.  **Verify Extraction and Sorting**: Double-check that the 6x6 extraction uses the top-left corner of the *significant* component's bounding box and that sorting is consistently applied based on these coordinates.

  - Gray (5) consistently acts as noise, ignored for component identification.
  - Only 'significant' components (size > ~4) define the patterns for the output. Small components (size 1-2) are ignored.
  - Other colors present within the 6x6 extraction area that are not the primary color or background are treated as noise during cleaning and replaced by the background color.
  - The number of patterns in the output equals the number of significant components found.
  - Output width is always 6 pixels.
  - Output height is 6 times the number of significant components found.

actions:
  1. Identify the background_color.
  2. Find all components of colors other than background_color and noise_color (5).
  3. Filter these components to keep only significant_components (e.g., size > 4).
  4. For each significant_component:
     a. Determine its component_top_left coordinate (min_r, min_c).
     b. Check if a 6x6 area starting at (min_r, min_c) fits within the input grid.
     c. If it fits, extract the 6x6 raw_pattern.

  6. Vertically stack the sorted cleaned_patterns to create the output_grid.
  7. If no significant components are found, output an empty grid (e.g., 0x6).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Background and Noise**: Determine the background color by finding the most frequent color in the input grid, ignoring gray (color 5). Gray (5) is considered a noise color.
2.  **Find Significant Components**: Locate all connected components (using 8-way adjacency) of any color that is *not* the background color and *not* the noise color (gray). Filter these components, keeping only those with a size (pixel count) greater than 4. These are the "significant components".
3.  **Extract and Clean Patterns**: For each significant component found:
    a.  Calculate its bounding box and find the top-left coordinate `(min_r, min_c)`.
    b.  Verify that a 6x6 pixel area starting at `(min_r, min_c)` fits entirely within the bounds of the input grid.
    c.  If it fits, extract this 6x6 area from the input grid (the "raw pattern"). Let the color of the current significant component be the "primary color".
    d.  Create a "cleaned pattern" from the raw pattern: iterate through the 6x6 raw pattern; if a pixel's color is the primary color or the background color, keep it; otherwise, replace the pixel's color with the background color.
    e.  Store this cleaned 6x6 pattern, associating it with the `(min_r, min_c)` coordinate from step 3a.
4.  **Sort Patterns**: Sort the collected cleaned patterns based on their associated `(min_r, min_c)` coordinates, first by row index (`min_r`) and then by column index (`min_c`).
5.  **Assemble Output**: Construct the final output grid by vertically stacking the sorted cleaned patterns in order. If no significant components were found and processed, the output should be an empty grid with a width of 6 (0 rows, 6 columns).## General Assessment

The provided code attempted to solve the task by identifying colored components, extracting 6x6 pixel areas starting from their top-left corners, cleaning these areas, sorting them, and stacking them. However, the execution results show failures across all training examples.

Key issues observed:
1.  **Incorrect Number of Patterns:** The code often generates more patterns than expected (Examples 1, 2, 4), indicating it's identifying components that should be ignored.
2.  **Incorrect Pattern Content:** Even when the output size matches (Example 3), the pixel content is wrong. This suggests either the wrong components are being selected, the cleaning process is flawed, or both. The presence of unexpected colors (Maroon 9 in Ex1 output, Orange 7 in Ex3 output, Red 2 in Ex4 output) confirms that non-primary, non-background colors are not being correctly removed during cleaning, or that patterns are being generated from insignificant components.
3.  **Component Selection Logic:** The code treats all non-background, non-noise components equally. The examples suggest that only larger, more "significant" shapes should trigger pattern generation, while small, isolated pixels or minor components should be disregarded.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Filter Components by Size:** Introduce a size threshold to distinguish between "significant" components (which generate patterns) and "insignificant" ones (which are ignored). Analysis suggests components with size <= 4 pixels should likely be ignored.
2.  **Refine Cleaning Process:** Ensure the cleaning step correctly uses the color of the *significant* component as the primary color for that specific 6x6 pattern. Critically, *all* other colors within the 6x6 area, including gray (5) and any other stray colors, must be replaced by the background color.
3.  **Consistent Application:** Apply the process consistently: identify significant components -> extract 6x6 from their top-left -> clean using the component's color -> sort based on top-left -> stack.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Input:** Determine the `background_color` by finding the most frequent color in the input grid, excluding gray (color 5). Note that gray (5) acts as `noise_color`.
2.  **Find Significant Shapes:** Identify all connected groups of pixels (components) that are neither the `background_color` nor the `noise_color`. From these, select only the "significant components" which are defined as components having more than 4 pixels.
3.  **Extract and Clean Patterns:** For each significant component identified:
    *   Find its top-left bounding box coordinate, `(min_r, min_c)`.
    *   Check if a 6x6 area starting at `(min_r, min_c)` fits within the input grid dimensions.
    *   If it fits, extract the 6x6 subgrid (the "raw pattern"). Let the color of this significant component be the `primary_color`.
    *   Create a new 6x6 "cleaned pattern" grid. Fill it by copying pixels from the raw pattern only if they match the `primary_color` or the `background_color`. Replace all other pixels with the `background_color`.
    *   Store this cleaned pattern along with its origin coordinate `(min_r, min_c)`.
4.  **Sort:** Arrange the generated cleaned patterns in order based on their `(min_r, min_c)` coordinates, sorting primarily by row (`min_r`) and secondarily by column (`min_c`).
5.  **Combine:** Vertically stack the sorted cleaned patterns to produce the final output grid. If no significant components were found that fit the 6x6 extraction criteria, the output is an empty grid with 0 rows and 6 columns.
