It ignored the Red pixel at (9,7) perhaps due to boundary issues for 6x6 extraction.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Target shapes (Red, Azure, Green): Sizes 9, 9, 10.\n    *   Ignored shapes (Orange): Sizes 1, 1, 1.\n    *   *Result*: The code generated patterns for Red (size 9 at (2,0)), Orange (size 1 at (4,3)), and Azure (size 9 at (5,3)). It missed the Green shape and used an Orange pixel instead. Why? Sorting is by (min_r, min_c). Red=(2,0), Orange=(4,3), Azure=(5,3). The Green shape starts at (8,6). It seems the code picked the first 3 components based on the sorting order. This suggests a flaw in simply taking all components and sorting.\n\n**Revised Hypotheses & Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Component Filtering**: A size threshold seems necessary. Components with size < ~5 (need to confirm threshold) should be ignored. Let's try ignoring components with size < 5.\n    *   Ex 1: Ignores Maroon (size 1). Keeps Yellow, Azure, Green. -> Correct components.\n    *   Ex 4: Ignores Red (size 1, 1), keeps Yellow (12), Green (10). -> Correct components.\n    *   Ex 3: Ignores Orange (size 1, 1, 1), keeps Red (9), Azure (9), Green (10). -> Correct components.\n    *   Ex 2: (Need to run component analysis) Assuming Yellow, Azure, Blue shapes are large enough, this filter seems promising.\n2.  **Cleaning Logic**: The `clean_pattern` function appears mostly correct, but let's ensure it explicitly replaces *all* non-primary, non-background colors with the background. This includes Gray (5) and any other colors like Orange (7) in Ex3. The current code iterates and only keeps primary or background. This should be correct. Maybe the issue in Ex3/Ex4 was using the wrong primary color due to incorrect component selection?\n3.  **Extraction Point**: Always use the top-left corner `(min_r, min_c)` of the *filtered* component's bounding box as the top-left corner for the 6x6 extraction.\n4.  **Sorting**: Sort the resulting *cleaned* 6x6 patterns based on the `(min_r, min_c)` coordinates of the components they were derived from.\n5.  **Stacking**: Vertically stack the sorted patterns.\n\nLet's refine the natural language program based on this.\n\n---\n## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core task elements: finding components, extracting 6x6 areas, cleaning, sorting, and stacking. However, it failed on all examples, primarily due to:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Component Selection**: The code processed *all* non-background, non-noise components, including small, isolated pixels (e.g., Maroon in Ex1, Red in Ex4, Orange in Ex3) that should have been ignored. This led to extra, incorrect patterns in the output.\n2.  **Incorrect Output Size**: Directly resulting from selecting the wrong number of components.\n3.  **Incorrect Pattern Content**:\n    *   Sometimes resulted from selecting the wrong component (e.g., using Orange instead of Green in Ex3).\n    *   Sometimes the cleaning itself seemed slightly off, potentially because the primary color used for cleaning was derived from a small, incorrect component, or the cleaning logic didn't handle all non-primary/non-background colors correctly within the 6x6 area. The color palettes of the transformed outputs often contained unexpected colors (e.g., 9 in Ex1, 7 in Ex3, 2 in Ex4).\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Implement Component Filtering**: Introduce a filter (e.g., minimum size threshold) to select only the \"significant\" components that correspond to the patterns in the expected output. Based on analysis, components with fewer than ~5 pixels seem to be ignored.\n2.  **Refine Cleaning**: Ensure the cleaning process within the 6x6 extracted area correctly identifies the single \"primary color\" (from the significant component) and the background color, replacing *all* other pixels (including noise like gray and other stray colors) with the background color.\n3.  **Verify Extraction and Sorting**: Double-check that the 6x6 extraction uses the top-left corner of the *significant* component's bounding box and that sorting is consistently applied based on these coordinates.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nUsing `tool_code` execution:\n\n| Example | Input Dim | Expected Output Dim | Transformed Output Dim | Size Match | Expected Colors | Transformed Colors | Colors Match | Significant Components (Color, Size, TopLeft) | Ignored Components (Color, Size, TopLeft) | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 20x20 | (18, 6) | (36, 6) | False | {2, 3, 4, 8} | {2, 3, 4, 8, 9} | False | (Y:12 @ 7,1), (A:10 @ 7,7), (G:10 @ 8,11) | (M:1 @ 10,3), (M:1 @ 10,13) | Transformed has 6 patterns instead of 3.

If no significant components were found and processed, the output should be an empty grid with a width of 6 (0 rows, 6 columns).## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempted to solve the task by identifying colored components, extracting 6x6 pixel areas starting from their top-left corners, cleaning these areas, sorting them, and stacking them. However, the execution results show failures across all training examples.\n\nKey issues observed:\n1.  **Incorrect Number of Patterns:** The code often generates more patterns than expected (Examples 1, 2, 4), indicating it's identifying components that should be ignored.\n2.  **Incorrect Pattern Content:** Even when the output size matches (Example 3), the pixel content is wrong. This suggests either the wrong components are being selected, the cleaning process is flawed, or both. The presence of unexpected colors (Maroon 9 in Ex1 output, Orange 7 in Ex3 output, Red 2 in Ex4 output) confirms that non-primary, non-background colors are not being correctly removed during cleaning, or that patterns are being generated from insignificant components.\n3.  **Component Selection Logic:** The code treats all non-background, non-noise components equally. The examples suggest that only larger, more \"significant\" shapes should trigger pattern generation, while small, isolated pixels or minor components should be disregarded.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Filter Components by Size:** Introduce a size threshold to distinguish between \"significant\" components (which generate patterns) and \"insignificant\" ones (which are ignored). Analysis suggests components with size <= 4 pixels should likely be ignored.\n2.  **Refine Cleaning Process:** Ensure the cleaning step correctly uses the color of the *significant* component as the primary color for that specific 6x6 pattern. Critically, *all* other colors within the 6x6 area, including gray (5) and any other stray colors, must be replaced by the background color.\n3.  **Consistent Application:** Apply the process consistently: identify significant components -> extract 6x6 from their top-left -> clean using the component's color -> sort based on top-left -> stack.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\n| Example | Input Dim | Expected Output Dim | Transformed Output Dim | Size Match | Expected Colors | Transformed Colors | Colors Match | Significant Components (Color, Size, TopLeft) | Ignored Components (Color, Size, TopLeft) | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 20x20 | (18, 6) | (36, 6) | False | {2, 3, 4, 8} | {2, 3, 4, 8, 9} | False | (Y:12 @ 7,1), (A:10 @ 7,7), (G:10 @ 8,11) | (M:1 @ 10,3), (M:1 @ 10,13) | Transformed has 6 patterns (from all components) vs. expected 3 (from Y, A, G).
