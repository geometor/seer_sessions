The expected Green output is symmetrical.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n1.  **Background/Noise:** Identification seems correct. Background is the most frequent non-gray color. Gray (5) is noise.\n2.  **Significant Components:** Finding connected components (8-way) and filtering by size > 4 seems correct. Other colors like Orange (7) or Red (2) in some examples are correctly ignored as they are noise or form components <= 4 pixels.\n3.  **Extraction:** The rule \"Extract 6x6 window starting from component top-left `(min_r, min_c)`\" is problematic. It works for *some* shapes (Ex1 Yellow) but fails for others because the 6x6 window goes out of bounds (Ex2 Blue, Ex3 Green, Ex4 Green). However, these shapes *are* present in the expected output.\n4.  **Cleaning:** The rule \"Keep only primary color and background color from the raw 6x6 pattern\" explains the *transformed* output (assuming the execution trace in the prompt had errors). However, this cleaned pattern does not always match the *expected* output. The expected output patterns often appear symmetrical, even when the input component or the raw 6x6 extraction is not.\n5.  **Output Size:** The output size is always `N * 6` rows and `6` columns, where `N` is the number of *expected* significant shapes.\n6.  **Ordering:** Sorting by top-left coordinate (row, then column) seems correct based on the expected outputs.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:**\n\nThe task involves identifying significant components (>4 pixels, non-background, non-gray). For each component, a canonical 6x6 representation of its *shape* needs to be generated. This generation might not be a simple 6x6 subgrid extraction. Instead, it might involve:\n\n*   Finding the component's pixels.\n*   Normalizing their coordinates relative to the component's top-left corner `(min_r, min_c)`.\n*   Creating a 6x6 grid initialized with the background color.\n*   Placing the primary color onto this 6x6 grid at the normalized coordinates `(r - min_r, c - min_c)` for each pixel `(r, c)` in the component, *only if* `r - min_r < 6` and `c - min_c < 6`.\n*   This resulting 6x6 pattern is the \"cleaned pattern\".\n\nLet's test this revised \"cleaning\" / generation hypothesis on Ex1 Azure:\n\n*   Component pixels: {(7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,10), (9,11), (10,7), (10,11), (11,7), (11,10), (12,8), (12,9)}\n*   Min_r=7, Min_c=7.

Does this imply scaling?\n\nLet's reconsider the *first* approach: Extract 6x6 window from top-left, then clean by keeping only primary and background. This seemed to match the `Transformed Output` (if we ignore the potentially erroneous one reported for Ex1 Green).\nWhy does this fail the overall task?\n1.  It fails to produce the *expected* symmetrical outputs when they differ from the cleaned extraction.\n2.  It fails to extract components where the 6x6 window goes out of bounds.\n\nMaybe the core issue is the extraction window. What if it's not always 6x6 *from the top-left*?\nWhat if we find the component, find its bounding box, and extract a 6x6 window centered on the bounding box center? Or maybe aligned differently?\n\nLet's revisit Ex2 Blue, which failed the bounds check.\nComponent BB: `(5,0)` to `(9,4)`. Height 5, Width 5. Center approx `(7, 2)`.\nExtract 6x6 centered at (7,2)? `row_start = 7 - floor(6/2) + 1 = 7-3+1 = 5`. `col_start = 2 - floor(6/2) + 1 = 2-3+1 = 0`.\nExtract `grid[5:11, 0:6]`. Still out of bounds.\n\nMaybe the reference point for the 6x6 window isn't the component's top-left, but some other feature?\n\nLet's look at the examples where the code worked (partially):\nEx1 Yellow: BB (7,1) to (12,6). Size 6x6. Top-left (7,1). 6x6 extraction from (7,1) works.\nEx2 Yellow: BB (1,3) to (6,8). Size 6x6. Top-left (1,3). 6x6 extraction from (1,3) works.\nEx3 Red: BB (2,2) to (7,7). Size 6x6.

Top-left (2,3). 6x6 extraction from (2,3) works.\n\nIt seems the 6x6 extraction from the component's top-left corner *is* the correct mechanism, BUT the previous code's check `if min_r + 6 <= rows and min_c + 6 <= cols:` might be too strict or subtly wrong.\n\nThe output *always* includes a 6x6 pattern for *every* significant component. The code fails when the extraction goes out of bounds. How can we extract a 6x6 pattern even if it goes out of bounds? Pad the input grid?\n\nHypothesis 4:\n1.  Pad the input grid sufficiently on all sides (e.g., 5 cells) with the background color.\n2.  Find background color (most frequent non-gray in *original* grid).\n3.  Find significant components (>4 pixels, non-bg, non-gray) in the *original* grid. Coordinates are relative to the original grid.\n4.  For each significant component:\n    a.  Get primary color `P`, pixels `{(r, c)}`, top-left `(min_r, min_c)` relative to original grid.\n    b.  Extract a 6x6 window from the *padded* grid, starting at the coordinate corresponding to `(min_r, min_c)` in the original grid. (If padding is 5, this is `padded_grid[min_r+5 : min_r+5+6, min_c+5 : min_c+5+6]`). Let this be `raw_pattern`.\n    c.  Create the 6x6 output pattern `O` initialized with background color `B`.\n    d.  Iterate `r` from 0 to 5, `c` from 0 to 5.\n    e.  If `raw_pattern[r, c]` is `P` or `B`, set `O[r, c] = raw_pattern[r, c]`. (This is the original cleaning logic).\n    f.  Store `O` and `(min_r, min_c)`.\n5.  Sort by `(min_r, min_c)`.\n6.  Stack vertically.\n\nLet's test this padding approach on Ex2 Blue:\n1.  Original grid 10x10. Background=3. Pad with 3s (e.g., to 20x20).\n2.

The expected output seems to involve generating a canonical, symmetrical 6x6 pattern for each significant input component. The exact mechanism for generating this pattern is unclear, but it seems dependent on the component's shape/pixels, results in a symmetrical 6x6 grid, and preserves the primary color. The number of primary color pixels might change. The sorting is based on the original component's top-left corner.\n\nLet's assume the generation of the canonical 6x6 symmetrical pattern is a black box for now. The overall structure seems to be: Find components, filter significant ones, generate canonical 6x6 pattern for each, sort by original top-left, stack.\n\nThe previous code implemented Find->Filter->Extract(6x6 from top-left)->Clean(Keep P/B)->Sort->Stack.\nThe errors indicate problems with the Extract step (bounds) and the Clean step (doesn't match expected symmetrical output).\n\n**Strategy for Update:**\n\n1.  Acknowledge the previous code's limitations regarding out-of-bounds extraction and mismatch with expected symmetrical patterns.\n2.  Propose a revised process focusing on generating a *canonical* 6x6 pattern for each shape, rather than direct extraction/cleaning.\n3.  Highlight the observation that expected output patterns are symmetrical.\n4.  The exact generation rule for the canonical pattern remains elusive based *only* on the failed examples. It likely involves processing the component's relative pixel coordinates and producing a standardized, symmetrical 6x6 output.\n5.  The sorting rule (by original top-left) appears correct.\n\nI will structure the response around this revised understanding.## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying significant connected components, extracting a 6x6 area starting from the component's top-left corner, cleaning this area by keeping only the primary and background colors, sorting these patterns, and stacking them.\n\nThe results show this approach is partially successful but fails on several examples:\n1.  **Extraction Failure:** The code correctly identifies significant components but fails to process them if the 6x6 extraction window starting at the component's top-left coordinate extends beyond the input grid boundaries (Examples 2, 3, 4). However, the expected output *does* include patterns for these components.\n2.  **Pattern Mismatch:** Even when the extraction is successful, the \"cleaned\" pattern (keeping only primary/background colors from the 6x6 raw extraction) does not always match the corresponding 6x6 pattern in the expected output (Examples 1 Azure, 1 Green). The expected output patterns consistently appear to be 6x6 and possess horizontal and vertical symmetry, which is not always true for the raw extracted or simply cleaned patterns.\n\nThe strategy moving forward is to refine the understanding of how the 6x6 output patterns are generated. The simple extraction/cleaning method is insufficient. The transformation likely involves generating a canonical, symmetrical 6x6 representation for *each* significant component, regardless of whether a direct 6x6 extraction fits. The sorting based on the component's original top-left position seems correct.\n\n## Metrics and Observations per Example\n\n**Common Parameters:**\n*   Noise Color: Gray (5) - appears ignored.\n*   Significance Threshold: Component size > 4 pixels.\n*   Output Pattern Size: Always 6x6 per component.\n*   Output Assembly: Vertical stacking of 6x6 patterns.\n*   Sorting: Based on component top-left `(min_r, min_c)` in input, row-major.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input: 20x20, Expected Output: 18x6 (3 patterns)\n*   Background: Red (2)\n*   Components (Color, Size, Top-Left, 6x6 Fits?, Matches Expected?):\n    *   Yellow (4), 12, (7, 1), Yes, Yes (Pattern matches simple clean)\n    *   Azure (8), 11, (7, 7), Yes, No (Expected is symmetrical)\n    *   Green (3), 12, (8, 10), Yes, No (Expected is symmetrical)\n*   Code Output: 18x6 (Correct size, matches simple clean, differs from expected)\n*   Observation: Simple cleaning matches transformed output but not expected for Azure/Green. Expected patterns are symmetrical.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input: 10x10, Expected Output: 18x6 (3 patterns)\n*   Background: Green (3)\n*   Components (Color, Size, Top-Left, 6x6 Fits?, Matches Expected?):\n    *   Yellow (4), 12, (1, 3), Yes, Yes (Pattern matches simple clean)\n    *   Azure (8), 6, (2, 4), Yes, No (Expected is symmetrical)\n    *   Blue (1), 7, (5, 0), No (Needs row 10, col 0-5), Yes (Expected includes a symmetrical blue pattern)\n*   Code Output: 12x6 (Missed Blue component due to bounds check)\n*   Observation: Bounds check prevents processing Blue. Expected output requires a pattern even when 6x6 extraction fails. Expected Azure/Blue patterns are symmetrical.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input: 13x13, Expected Output: 18x6 (3 patterns)\n*   Background: Yellow (4)\n*   Components (Color, Size, Top-Left, 6x6 Fits?, Matches Expected?):\n    *   Red (2), 12, (2, 2), Yes, Yes (Pattern matches simple clean)\n    *   Azure (8), 12, (5, 5), Yes, Yes (Pattern matches simple clean)\n    *   Green (3), 10, (8, 6), No (Needs row 13, col 6-11), Yes (Expected includes a symmetrical green pattern)\n*   Code Output: 12x6 (Missed Green component due to bounds check)\n*   Observation: Bounds check prevents processing Green.
