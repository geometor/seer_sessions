        *   Okay, the analysis confirms: there are two blue components. One has size 3 (not significant), the other has size 7 (significant).
        *   The top-left of the significant blue component is (5, 0).
        *   A 6x6 window starting at (5, 0) would be `grid[5:11, 0:6]`. Since the grid is 10x10, this *does not fit* (needs rows up to index 10, but max index is 9).
        *   This explains why the blue component was excluded. The rule "Check if a 6x6 area starting at (min_r, min_c) fits" seems correct based on this example.
        *   However, the *expected* output *does* include the blue shape. This implies the rule about extracting a 6x6 window *from the top-left of the component* might be wrong, or there's another mechanism.
        *   Let's look at the expected blue output shape:
            
```
            3 3 1 1 3 3
            3 1 3 3 1 3
            1 3 3 3 3 1
            1 3 3 3 3 1
            3 1 3 3 1 3
            3 3 1 1 3 3
            ```

        *   Where could this 6x6 block come from in the input? Let's find the blue pixels again: `(4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 5), (7, 0), (8, 1), (8, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3)`.
        *   The output shape seems related to the *pattern* of the blue pixels, but maybe not extracted directly as a block.
        *   Could it be the bounding box of the significant component?
            *   Significant blue component pixels: `[(5, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 4)]`
            *   Min row = 5, Max row = 9 (height 5)
            *   Min col = 0, Max col = 4 (width 5)
            *   Bounding box: `grid[5:10, 0:5]`
            
```
            3 1 4 3 1
            1 3 3 4 4
            1 3 5 3 8
            3 1 3 3 1
            3 3 1 1 3
            ```

        *   This doesn't look like the target 6x6 output.
        *   What if the 6x6 window isn't aligned with the component's top-left, but rather centered or aligned differently?
        *   What if the output shape is *constructed* rather than *extracted*? Look at the yellow shape in Ex1.
            *   Input component pixels: (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,5), (9,1), (9,6), (10,1), (10,6), (11,2), (11,5), (12,3), (12,4) - Size 12 (>4).
            *   Min_r=7, Min_c=1.
            *   6x6 from (7,1): `grid[7:13, 1:7]`
                
```
                2 4 4 2 2 2
                2 4 2 2 4 2
                4 2 2 2 2 4
                4 2 9 2 2 4
                2 4 2 2 4 2
                2 2 4 4 2 2
                ```

            *   Cleaned (keep 4 and 2, replace others with 2):
                
```
                2 4 4 2 2 2
                2 4 2 2 4 2
                4 2 2 2 2 4
                4 2 2 2 2 4  <-- 9 replaced by 2
                2 4 2 2 4 2
                2 2 4 4 2 2
                ```

            *   This matches the *expected* yellow output for Example 1.
            *   So, the 6x6 extraction from the top-left corner works for Ex1 Yellow. Why did it fail for Ex1 Azure/Green and Ex2 Blue?

        *   Revisit Ex1 Azure (Color 8):
            *   Component pixels: (7,8),(7,9), (8,7),(8,10), (9,11), (10,7),(10,11), (11,7),(11,10), (12,8),(12,9) - Size 11 (>4).

                ```

            *   This matches the *transformed* output for Ex1 Azure, but not the *expected* output.
            *   Expected Azure Output:

                ```

            *   The expected output has a different pattern of 8s and 2s. It seems the "cleaning" process might be more complex than just keeping primary/background colors. Maybe it preserves the *shape* of the component within the 6x6 window, filling the rest with background?

        *   Let's redefine "cleaning":
            1. Extract the 6x6 `raw_pattern` starting from the component's top-left `(min_r, min_c)`.
            2. Create a new 6x6 `cleaned_pattern` initialized with the `background_color`.
            3. Iterate through the pixels `(r, c)` from `0` to `5`.
            4. Check if the corresponding global coordinate `(min_r + r, min_c + c)` belongs to the *current significant component's pixels*.
            5. If it does, set `cleaned_pattern[r, c]` to the `primary_color` of the component.
            6. Otherwise, leave it as `background_color`.

        *   Let's try this new cleaning on Ex1 Azure:
            *   Component pixels: {(7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,10), (9,11), (10,7), (10,11), (11,7), (11,10), (12,8), (12,9)}
            *   Min_r=7, Min_c=7. Primary_color=8. Background=2.
            *   We are looking at the 6x6 window from (7,7) to (12,12).
            *   Initialize 6x6 grid with 2s.
            *   Check which global coords are in the component set:
                *   (7,8) -> (0,1) in 6x6 window. Set to 8.
                *   (7,9) -> (0,2) in 6x6 window. Set to 8.
                *   (8,7) -> (1,0) in 6x6 window. Set to 8.
                *   (8,10) -> (1,3) in 6x6 window. Set to 8.
                *   (9,11) -> (2,4) in 6x6 window. Set to 8.
                *   (10,7) -> (3,0) in 6x6 window. Set to 8.
                *   (10,11) -> (3,4) in 6x6 window. Set to 8.
                *   (11,7) -> (4,0) in 6x6 window. Set to 8.
                *   (11,10) -> (4,3) in 6x6 window. Set to 8.
                *   (12,8) -> (5,1) in 6x6 window. Set to 8.
                *   (12,9) -> (5,2) in 6x6 window. Set to 8.
            *   Resulting cleaned pattern:
                
```

                2 8 8 2 2 2
                ```

            *   This *still* doesn't match the expected output.
                
```
                # Expected:
                2 2 8 8 2 2
                2 8 2 2 8 2
                8 2 2 2 2 8

                2 8 2 2 8 2
                2 2 8 8 2 2
                ```

            *   Maybe the component finding is wrong? Is `(9,11)` really part of the main Azure component? Let's look at the input grid around that area.
                
```
                 7: . . . . . . . 8 8 . . . .
                 8: . . . . . . 8 . . 8 . 3 3
                 9: . . . . . . 5 . . . 8 . .
                10: . . . . . . 2 . . 3 8 . .
                11: . . . . . . 8 . . 8 . . .
                12: . . . . . . . 8 8 . 3 . .
                ```

                Pixel (9, 11) is Azure (8). Its neighbours are: (8,10)=8, (8,12)=?, (9,10)=3, (9,12)=?, (10,10)=3, (10,11)=8, (10,12)=?. Yes, it connects to (8,10) and (10,11). My previous component finding seems correct.

            *   What if the 6x6 window is not fixed? What if the output is always a 6x6 representation of the *shape* itself, possibly scaled or centered?
            *   The shapes in the output look symmetrical. The input shapes are not always perfectly symmetrical.
            *   Compare Ex1 Input Yellow shape vs Output Yellow shape: They are identical.
            *   Compare Ex1 Input Azure shape vs Output Azure shape: They are different. The output is symmetrical.
            *   Compare Ex1 Input Green shape vs Output Green shape: They look different. Output is symmetrical.

            *   Hypothesis: Extract the 6x6 window from the top-left. Identify the pixels belonging to the component within that window. Create a *symmetrical* 6x6 output pattern based on those pixels? How to define the symmetry? Maybe reflect across vertical and horizontal centers?

            *   Let's try the "just keep primary/background" cleaning again, but carefully compare Ex1 Azure:
                *   Raw 6x6 from (7,7):

                    ```

                *   Keep only 8 (primary) and 2 (background):
                    
```

                    ```

                *   My previous comparison was wrong. The "Transformed Output" for Ex1 Azure *does* match the "keep primary/background" cleaning rule.
                *   Why did the overall result for Ex1 fail then? Let's check Green (3).

                            cleaned = np.full_like(raw_pattern, background_color)
                            rows, cols = raw_pattern.shape

                                for c in range(cols):
                                    pixel_color = raw_pattern[r, c]
                                    # Keep pixel ONLY IF it's primary OR background
                                    if pixel_color == primary_color or pixel_color == background_color:
                                        cleaned[r, c] = pixel_color
                                    # Otherwise it remains background_color (due to np.full_like)
                            return cleaned

                    *   This reconstructed output is different from *both* the `Expected Output` and the `Transformed Output` shown in the prompt for Example 1. This suggests a potential issue in the reporting tool or a misunderstanding of the original code's behaviour. However, I must proceed based on the code provided.

                    *   **Key Insight for Ex1:** The `clean_pattern` function (keeping only primary/background) seems correctly implemented and explains the *actual* likely output of the code. The discrepancy lies between this output and the `Expected Output`. The `Expected Output` patterns for Azure and Green are different - they are symmetrical versions.

*   **Example 2 (Revisited):**
    *   The code correctly identified Yellow and Azure shapes, extracted 6x6, cleaned them (keeping primary/background), and produced the first 12 rows of the transformed output.
    *   It missed the Blue shape because the 6x6 window starting at its top-left (5,0) went out of bounds.
    *   However, the *expected* output includes the Blue shape. This strongly suggests the 6x6 extraction is not *always* from the top-left OR the output shape is not a direct 6x6 extraction.
    *   The expected Blue output is symmetrical.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 13x13, Output: 18x6, Transformed: 12x6. Size mismatch.
    *   Background: Yellow (4). Noise: Gray (5).
    *   Primary colors: Red (2), Azure (8), Green (3). Also some Orange (7) pixels exist but seem to be noise/ignored.
    *   The code extracted Red (2) and Azure (8). It missed Green (3).
    *   Let's check the Green component(s).

        *   The significant Green component (size 8) has top-left (2, 6). A 6x6 window `grid[2:8, 6:12]` does not fit (needs column 11, max index is 9).
        *   This confirms why the code missed the Green shape.
        *   The *expected* output *includes* the Green shape. The expected Green output is symmetrical.

**Summary of Findings:**

1.  **Background/Noise:** Identification seems correct. Background is the most frequent non-gray color. Gray (5) is noise.
2.  **Significant Components:** Finding connected components (8-way) and filtering by size > 4 seems correct. Other colors like Orange (7) or Red (2) in some examples are correctly ignored as they are noise or form components <= 4 pixels.
3.  **Extraction:** The rule "Extract 6x6 window starting from component top-left `(min_r, min_c)`" is problematic. It works for *some* shapes (Ex1 Yellow) but fails for others because the 6x6 window goes out of bounds (Ex2 Blue, Ex3 Green, Ex4 Green). However, these shapes *are* present in the expected output.
4.  **Cleaning:** The rule "Keep only primary color and background color from the raw 6x6 pattern" explains the *transformed* output (assuming the execution trace in the prompt had errors). However, this cleaned pattern does not always match the *expected* output. The expected output patterns often appear symmetrical, even when the input component or the raw 6x6 extraction is not.
5.  **Output Size:** The output size is always `N * 6` rows and `6` columns, where `N` is the number of *expected* significant shapes.
6.  **Ordering:** Sorting by top-left coordinate (row, then column) seems correct based on the expected outputs.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

The task involves identifying significant components (>4 pixels, non-background, non-gray). For each component, a canonical 6x6 representation of its *shape* needs to be generated. This generation might not be a simple 6x6 subgrid extraction. Instead, it might involve:

*   Finding the component's pixels.
*   Normalizing their coordinates relative to the component's top-left corner `(min_r, min_c)`.
*   Creating a 6x6 grid initialized with the background color.
*   Placing the primary color onto this 6x6 grid at the normalized coordinates `(r - min_r, c - min_c)` for each pixel `(r, c)` in the component, *only if* `r - min_r < 6` and `c - min_c < 6`.
*   This resulting 6x6 pattern is the "cleaned pattern".

Let's test this revised "cleaning" / generation hypothesis on Ex1 Azure:

*   Component pixels: {(7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,10), (9,11), (10,7), (10,11), (11,7), (11,10), (12,8), (12,9)}
*   Min_r=7, Min_c=7. Primary=8. Background=2.
*   Initialize 6x6 grid with 2s.
*   Normalized coordinates `(r-7, c-7)` for pixels within 6x6 range:
    *   (7,8) -> (0,1)
    *   (7,9) -> (0,2)
    *   (8,7) -> (1,0)
    *   (8,10) -> (1,3)
    *   (9,11) -> (2,4)
    *   (10,7) -> (3,0)
    *   (10,11) -> (3,4)
    *   (11,7) -> (4,0)
    *   (11,10) -> (4,3)
    *   (12,8) -> (5,1)
    *   (12,9) -> (5,2)
*   Place 8s at these coordinates:
    
```
    2 8 8 2 2 2
    8 2 2 8 2 2
    2 2 2 2 8 2
    8 2 2 2 8 2
    8 2 2 8 2 2
    2 8 8 2 2 2
    ```

*   This matches the result of the previous `clean_pattern` logic *and* the transformed output (but still not the expected symmetrical output).

Let's try it on Ex2 Blue (the one that failed bounds check):

*   Significant Component pixels: `[(5, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 4)]`
*   Min_r=5, Min_c=0. Primary=1. Background=3.
*   Initialize 6x6 grid with 3s.
*   Normalized coordinates `(r-5, c-0)` for pixels within 6x6 range:
    *   (5,1) -> (0,1)
    *   (6,0) -> (1,0)
    *   (7,0) -> (2,0)
    *   (8,1) -> (3,1)
    *   (9,2) -> (4,2)
    *   (9,3) -> (4,3)
    *   (8,4) -> (3,4)
*   Place 1s at these coordinates:
    
```
    3 1 3 3 3 3
    1 3 3 3 3 3
    1 3 3 3 3 3
    3 1 3 3 1 3
    3 3 1 1 3 3
    3 3 3 3 3 3
    ```

*   This is a 6x6 grid, and it *doesn't* match the expected Blue output:
    
```
    # Expected Blue Output:
    3 3 1 1 3 3
    3 1 3 3 1 3
    1 3 3 3 3 1
    1 3 3 3 3 1
    3 1 3 3 1 3
    3 3 1 1 3 3
    ```

*   The shapes are clearly related but different. The expected one is symmetrical.

**Revised Hypothesis 2:**

Maybe the output 6x6 shape is derived purely from the *relative* positions of the component pixels, potentially centered or aligned within the 6x6 grid, and then symmetrized?

Consider the *bounding box* of the component.
*   Ex1 Azure: Min_r=7, Min_c=7, Max_r=12, Max_c=11. Height=6, Width=5.
*   Ex2 Blue: Min_r=5, Min_c=0, Max_r=9, Max_c=4. Height=5, Width=5.
*   Ex3 Green: Min_r=8, Min_c=6, Max_r=12, Max_c=11. Height=5, Width=6.
*   Ex4 Green: Min_r=2, Min_c=6, Max_r=7, Max_c=9. Height=6, Width=4.

The bounding box dimensions vary. The output is always 6x6.

What if we take the component pixels relative to their top-left, determine the extent (width `w`, height `h`), and then center this `h x w` pattern within a 6x6 grid filled with the background color?

Let's try Ex2 Blue:
*   Relative pixels (coords `(r-min_r, c-min_c)`): `(0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,4)`
*   Max relative row = 4 (height `h=5`). Max relative col = 4 (width `w=5`).
*   Center a 5x5 pattern in a 6x6 grid. Offsets: `row_offset = floor((6-5)/2) = 0`. `col_offset = floor((6-5)/2) = 0`.
*   Place the relative pixels at `(row + row_offset, col + col_offset)` in the 6x6 grid. This results in the same pattern as before, starting at (0,0). Still doesn't match expected.

What if the symmetry is key?
Look at the Expected Blue Output for Ex2:

```
3 3 1 1 3 3
3 1 3 3 1 3
1 3 3 3 3 1
1 3 3 3 3 1
3 1 3 3 1 3
3 3 1 1 3 3
```

This has perfect horizontal and vertical symmetry.
Let's check the other expected outputs:
*   Ex1 Yellow: Yes, symmetrical.
*   Ex1 Azure: Yes, symmetrical.
*   Ex1 Green: Yes, symmetrical.
*   Ex3 Red: Yes, symmetrical.
*   Ex3 Azure: Yes, symmetrical.
*   Ex3 Green: Yes, symmetrical.
*   Ex4 Yellow: Yes, symmetrical.
*   Ex4 Green: Yes, symmetrical.

**Revised Hypothesis 3 (Stronger):**

1.  Find background color (most frequent non-gray).
2.  Find all connected components (8-way) of non-background, non-gray colors.
3.  Filter for significant components (size > 4).
4.  For each significant component:
    a.  Determine its primary color.
    b.  Find the set of pixel coordinates `{(r, c)}` belonging to the component.
    c.  Generate a canonical 6x6 *symmetrical* representation of this component shape. (How? Maybe based on the bounding box or relative coordinates?)
    d.  Store this 6x6 pattern along with the component's top-left coordinate `(min_r, min_c)`.
5.  Sort the generated patterns by `(min_r, min_c)`.
6.  Stack the sorted 6x6 patterns vertically.

**How to generate the symmetrical 6x6 pattern?**

Let's analyze the relationship between the component pixels and the output pixels again for Ex2 Blue.
*   Component relative pixels: `(0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,4)`
*   Expected Output (1s pattern on 3 background):
    
```
    . . 1 1 . .  (0,2), (0,3)
    . 1 . . 1 .  (1,1), (1,4)
    1 . . . . 1  (2,0), (2,5)
    1 . . . . 1  (3,0), (3,5)
    . 1 . . 1 .  (4,1), (4,4)
    . . 1 1 . .  (5,2), (5,3)
    ```

There's no obvious direct mapping. The number of primary color pixels might even change.
*   Input Blue component size: 7
*   Output Blue shape size: 12

This implies the output shape is a *prototype* or *template* associated with the input component, not directly constructed pixel-by-pixel.

What defines which template to use?
*   Color? No, the Azure shape in Ex1 is different from Ex3.
*   Maybe some property of the component's shape? Like its bounding box size or aspect ratio?

Let's list BB sizes and primary colors:
*   Ex1 Yellow (4): 6x6 -> Output Yellow (matches)
*   Ex1 Azure (8): 6x5 -> Output Azure (symmetrical 6x6)
*   Ex1 Green (3): 5x6 -> Output Green (symmetrical 6x6)
*   Ex2 Yellow (4): 6x6 -> Output Yellow (matches)
*   Ex2 Azure (8): 6x4 -> Output Azure (symmetrical 6x6)
*   Ex2 Blue (1): 5x5 -> Output Blue (symmetrical 6x6)
*   Ex3 Red (2): 6x6 -> Output Red (matches)
*   Ex3 Azure (8): 6x6 -> Output Azure (matches)
*   Ex3 Green (3): 5x6 -> Output Green (symmetrical 6x6)
*   Ex4 Yellow (4): 6x6 -> Output Yellow (matches)
*   Ex4 Green (3): 6x4 -> Output Green (symmetrical 6x6)

Observation: When the component's bounding box is 6x6, the output shape seems to be exactly the component's pixels within that box (relative to top-left), placed on a background. When the bounding box is *not* 6x6, a different, symmetrical 6x6 pattern is produced.

**Let's refine Hypothesis 3:**

1.  Find background color.
2.  Find significant components (>4 pixels, non-bg, non-gray).
3.  For each significant component:
    a.  Get primary color `P`, pixels `{(r, c)}`, top-left `(min_r, min_c)`.
    b.  Calculate bounding box: `min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c`.
    c.  Calculate height `h = max_r - min_r + 1`, width `w = max_c - min_c + 1`.
    d.  Create the 6x6 output pattern `O` initialized with background color `B`.
    e.  **If `h == 6` and `w == 6`:**
        *   Iterate through component pixels `(r, c)`.
        *   Calculate relative coords: `rel_r = r - min_r`, `rel_c = c - min_c`.
        *   If `0 <= rel_r < 6` and `0 <= rel_c < 6`:
            *   Set `O[rel_r, rel_c] = P`.
    f.  **Else (`h != 6` or `w != 6`):**
        *   Generate a *specific, symmetrical* 6x6 pattern based on the primary color `P`. (We need to figure out *which* symmetrical pattern corresponds to which color/component characteristic). **This seems wrong, the symmetrical shapes aren't tied *only* to color.** Look at Ex1 Azure (6x5 BB) vs Ex2 Azure (6x4 BB) - they produce different symmetrical outputs!
            *   Ex1 Azure Expected Output: Has 12 Azure pixels.
            *   Ex2 Azure Expected Output: Has 12 Azure pixels. Same count, different shape.

**Let's discard the BB size rule.** The symmetry seems universal.

What if the "cleaning" step IS creating the symmetrical pattern?

Try again: Ex1 Azure. Component pixels relative to (7,7): `(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,3), (2,4), (3,0), (3,4), (4,0), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2)`
Expected Output (8s on 2 background):

```
. . 8 8 . .  (0,2), (0,3)
. 8 . . 8 .  (1,1), (1,4)
8 . . . . 8  (2,0), (2,5)
8 . . . . 8  (3,0), (3,5)
. 8 . . 8 .  (4,1), (4,4)
. . 8 8 . .  (5,2), (5,3)
```

How to get from the relative component pixels to the output pixels?

Maybe it involves reflecting the relative component pixels?
Relative pixels: `(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,3), (2,4), (3,0), (3,4), (4,0), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2)`
Reflect horizontally (around x=2.5): `c' = 5 - c`

Reflected V: `(5,1), (5,2), (4,0), (4,3), (3,4), (2,0), (2,4), (1,0), (1,3), (0,1), (0,2)`

Reflect both (HV): `r' = 5 - r`, `c' = 5 - c`
*   (0,1)->(5,4)
*   (0,2)->(5,3)
*   (1,0)->(4,5)
*   (1,3)->(4,2)
*   (2,4)->(3,1)

Reflected HV: `(5,4), (5,3), (4,5), (4,2), (3,1), (2,5), (2,1), (1,5), (1,2), (0,4), (0,3)`

Now, take the *union* of the original relative pixels and all their reflections (H, V, HV).
Original: `(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,3), (2,4), (3,0), (3,4), (4,0), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2)`

This is *still* not the expected output for Ex1 Azure.

Maybe the rule is simpler. What if the 6x6 output is just the *shape* of the component, drawn using the primary color, centered in the 6x6 grid, and the rest is background? Does this imply scaling?

Let's reconsider the *first* approach: Extract 6x6 window from top-left, then clean by keeping only primary and background. This seemed to match the `Transformed Output` (if we ignore the potentially erroneous one reported for Ex1 Green).
Why does this fail the overall task?
1.  It fails to produce the *expected* symmetrical outputs when they differ from the cleaned extraction.
2.  It fails to extract components where the 6x6 window goes out of bounds.

Maybe the core issue is the extraction window. What if it's not always 6x6 *from the top-left*?
What if we find the component, find its bounding box, and extract a 6x6 window centered on the bounding box center? Or maybe aligned differently?

Let's revisit Ex2 Blue, which failed the bounds check.
Component BB: `(5,0)` to `(9,4)`. Height 5, Width 5. Center approx `(7, 2)`.
Extract 6x6 centered at (7,2)? `row_start = 7 - floor(6/2) + 1 = 7-3+1 = 5`. `col_start = 2 - floor(6/2) + 1 = 2-3+1 = 0`.
Extract `grid[5:11, 0:6]`. Still out of bounds.

Maybe the reference point for the 6x6 window isn't the component's top-left, but some other feature?

Let's look at the examples where the code worked (partially):
Ex1 Yellow: BB (7,1) to (12,6). Size 6x6. Top-left (7,1). 6x6 extraction from (7,1) works.
Ex2 Yellow: BB (1,3) to (6,8). Size 6x6. Top-left (1,3). 6x6 extraction from (1,3) works.
Ex3 Red: BB (2,2) to (7,7). Size 6x6. Top-left (2,2). 6x6 extraction from (2,2) works.
Ex3 Azure: BB (5,5) to (10,10). Size 6x6. Top-left (5,5). 6x6 extraction from (5,5) works.
Ex4 Yellow: BB (2,3) to (7,8). Size 6x6. Top-left (2,3). 6x6 extraction from (2,3) works.

It seems the 6x6 extraction from the component's top-left corner *is* the correct mechanism, BUT the previous code's check `if min_r + 6 <= rows and min_c + 6 <= cols:` might be too strict or subtly wrong.

The output *always* includes a 6x6 pattern for *every* significant component. The code fails when the extraction goes out of bounds. How can we extract a 6x6 pattern even if it goes out of bounds? Pad the input grid?

Hypothesis 4:
1.  Pad the input grid sufficiently on all sides (e.g., 5 cells) with the background color.
2.  Find background color (most frequent non-gray in *original* grid).
3.  Find significant components (>4 pixels, non-bg, non-gray) in the *original* grid. Coordinates are relative to the original grid.
4.  For each significant component:
    a.  Get primary color `P`, pixels `{(r, c)}`, top-left `(min_r, min_c)` relative to original grid.
    b.  Extract a 6x6 window from the *padded* grid, starting at the coordinate corresponding to `(min_r, min_c)` in the original grid. (If padding is 5, this is `padded_grid[min_r+5 : min_r+5+6, min_c+5 : min_c+5+6]`). Let this be `raw_pattern`.
    c.  Create the 6x6 output pattern `O` initialized with background color `B`.
    d.  Iterate `r` from 0 to 5, `c` from 0 to 5.
    e.  If `raw_pattern[r, c]` is `P` or `B`, set `O[r, c] = raw_pattern[r, c]`. (This is the original cleaning logic).
    f.  Store `O` and `(min_r, min_c)`.
5.  Sort by `(min_r, min_c)`.
6.  Stack vertically.

Let's test this padding approach on Ex2 Blue:
1.  Original grid 10x10. Background=3. Pad with 3s (e.g., to 20x20).
2.  Significant Blue component top-left (5,0) relative to original.
3.  In padded grid (assuming 5 padding), this corresponds to (10, 5).
4.  Extract 6x6 from padded grid at (10, 5): `padded_grid[10:16, 5:11]`.
    *   Need to know the original grid content around (5,0).
    *   Original `grid[5:10, 0:6]` (rows 5-9, cols 0-5):
        
```
        3 1 4 3 1 4
        1 3 3 4 4 1
        1 3 5 3 8 8
        3 1 3 3 1 3
        3 3 1 1 3 3
        ```

    *   The `padded_grid[10:16, 5:11]` would correspond to `original_grid[5:11, 0:6]`. Since original is only 10 rows high, rows 10+ will be padding (color 3).
    *   So, the raw 6x6 extracted pattern `raw_pattern` is:
        
```
        3 1 4 3 1 4  # Original row 5 / Padded row 10
        1 3 3 4 4 1  # Original row 6 / Padded row 11
        1 3 5 3 8 8  # Original row 7 / Padded row 12
        3 1 3 3 1 3  # Original row 8 / Padded row 13
        3 3 1 1 3 3  # Original row 9 / Padded row 14
        3 3 3 3 3 3  # Padding        / Padded row 15
        ```

5.  Clean this `raw_pattern` (keep Primary=1, Background=3):
    
```
    3 1 3 3 1 3  # row 0
    1 3 3 3 3 1  # row 1
    1 3 3 3 3 3  # row 2
    3 1 3 3 1 3  # row 3
    3 3 1 1 3 3  # row 4
    3 3 3 3 3 3  # row 5
    ```

6.  This cleaned pattern still doesn't match the expected symmetrical blue pattern.

**Conclusion:** The simple extraction + cleaning model is insufficient. The expected output seems to involve generating a canonical, symmetrical 6x6 pattern for each significant input component. The exact mechanism for generating this pattern is unclear, but it seems dependent on the component's shape/pixels, results in a symmetrical 6x6 grid, and preserves the primary color. The number of primary color pixels might change. The sorting is based on the original component's top-left corner.

Let's assume the generation of the canonical 6x6 symmetrical pattern is a black box for now. The overall structure seems to be: Find components, filter significant ones, generate canonical 6x6 pattern for each, sort by original top-left, stack.

The previous code implemented Find->Filter->Extract(6x6 from top-left)->Clean(Keep P/B)->Sort->Stack.
The errors indicate problems with the Extract step (bounds) and the Clean step (doesn't match expected symmetrical output).

**Strategy for Update:**

1.  Acknowledge the previous code's limitations regarding out-of-bounds extraction and mismatch with expected symmetrical patterns.
2.  Propose a revised process focusing on generating a *canonical* 6x6 pattern for each shape, rather than direct extraction/cleaning.
3.  Highlight the observation that expected output patterns are symmetrical.
4.  The exact generation rule for the canonical pattern remains elusive based *only* on the failed examples. It likely involves processing the component's relative pixel coordinates and producing a standardized, symmetrical 6x6 output.
5.  The sorting rule (by original top-left) appears correct.

I will structure the response around this revised understanding.## General Assessment

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying significant connected components, extracting a 6x6 area starting from the component's top-left corner, cleaning this area by keeping only the primary and background colors, sorting these patterns, and stacking them.

The results show this approach is partially successful but fails on several examples:
1.  **Extraction Failure:** The code correctly identifies significant components but fails to process them if the 6x6 extraction window starting at the component's top-left coordinate extends beyond the input grid boundaries (Examples 2, 3, 4). However, the expected output *does* include patterns for these components.
2.  **Pattern Mismatch:** Even when the extraction is successful, the "cleaned" pattern (keeping only primary/background colors from the 6x6 raw extraction) does not always match the corresponding 6x6 pattern in the expected output (Examples 1 Azure, 1 Green). The expected output patterns consistently appear to be 6x6 and possess horizontal and vertical symmetry, which is not always true for the raw extracted or simply cleaned patterns.

The strategy moving forward is to refine the understanding of how the 6x6 output patterns are generated. The simple extraction/cleaning method is insufficient. The transformation likely involves generating a canonical, symmetrical 6x6 representation for *each* significant component, regardless of whether a direct 6x6 extraction fits. The sorting based on the component's original top-left position seems correct.

## Metrics and Observations per Example

**Common Parameters:**
*   Noise Color: Gray (5) - appears ignored.
*   Significance Threshold: Component size > 4 pixels.
*   Output Pattern Size: Always 6x6 per component.
*   Output Assembly: Vertical stacking of 6x6 patterns.
*   Sorting: Based on component top-left `(min_r, min_c)` in input, row-major.

**Example 1:**
*   Input: 20x20, Expected Output: 18x6 (3 patterns)
*   Background: Red (2)
*   Components (Color, Size, Top-Left, 6x6 Fits?, Matches Expected?):
    *   Yellow (4), 12, (7, 1), Yes, Yes (Pattern matches simple clean)
    *   Azure (8), 11, (7, 7), Yes, No (Expected is symmetrical)
    *   Green (3), 12, (8, 10), Yes, No (Expected is symmetrical)
*   Code Output: 18x6 (Correct size, matches simple clean, differs from expected)
*   Observation: Simple cleaning matches transformed output but not expected for Azure/Green. Expected patterns are symmetrical.

**Example 2:**
*   Input: 10x10, Expected Output: 18x6 (3 patterns)
*   Background: Green (3)
*   Components (Color, Size, Top-Left, 6x6 Fits?, Matches Expected?):
    *   Yellow (4), 12, (1, 3), Yes, Yes (Pattern matches simple clean)
    *   Azure (8), 6, (2, 4), Yes, No (Expected is symmetrical)
    *   Blue (1), 7, (5, 0), No (Needs row 10, col 0-5), Yes (Expected includes a symmetrical blue pattern)
*   Code Output: 12x6 (Missed Blue component due to bounds check)
*   Observation: Bounds check prevents processing Blue. Expected output requires a pattern even when 6x6 extraction fails. Expected Azure/Blue patterns are symmetrical.

**Example 3:**
*   Input: 13x13, Expected Output: 18x6 (3 patterns)
*   Background: Yellow (4)
*   Components (Color, Size, Top-Left, 6x6 Fits?, Matches Expected?):
    *   Red (2), 12, (2, 2), Yes, Yes (Pattern matches simple clean)
    *   Azure (8), 12, (5, 5), Yes, Yes (Pattern matches simple clean)
    *   Green (3), 10, (8, 6), No (Needs row 13, col 6-11), Yes (Expected includes a symmetrical green pattern)
*   Code Output: 12x6 (Missed Green component due to bounds check)
*   Observation: Bounds check prevents processing Green. Expected output requires a pattern even when 6x6 extraction fails. Expected Green pattern is symmetrical.

**Example 4:**
*   Input: 10x10, Expected Output: 12x6 (2 patterns)
*   Background: Azure (8)
