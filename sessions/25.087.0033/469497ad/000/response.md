*   **Perception:**
    *   The task involves scaling the input grid to produce the output grid.
    *   Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a square block of pixels in the output grid.
    *   The size of this square block (scaling factor N x N) is determined by the number of unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
    *   If an input pixel is non-white, the corresponding N x N block in the output is filled entirely with that pixel's color.
    *   If an input pixel is white (color 0), the corresponding N x N block in the output is filled with white, but the pixels along the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) of that block are changed to red (color 2).

    actions:
      - action: calculate_scaling_factor
        input: input_grid
        output: scaling_factor (N)
        logic: Count the number of distinct color values greater than 0 in the input grid.
      - action: create_output_grid
        input: input_grid dimensions (height, width), scaling_factor (N)
        output: output_grid
        logic: Initialize an empty grid with dimensions (N * height) x (N * width).
      - action: scale_and_fill
        input: input_grid, output_grid, scaling_factor (N)
        logic: For each pixel at (r, c) with color C in the input grid:
                 - Identify the target N x N block in the output grid starting at (N*r, N*c).
                 - If C is 0 (white):
                     - Fill the block with white (0).
                     - Change the pixels on the main diagonal of the block, i.e., at (N*r + i, N*c + i) for i from 0 to N-1, to red (2).
                 - If C is not 0 (non-white):
                     - Fill the entire block with color C.
    relationships:
      - Output grid dimensions are N times the input grid dimensions.
      - The content of each N x N block in the output depends on the color of the corresponding single pixel in the input.
      - The specific modification (inserting red diagonals) applies only to blocks corresponding to white input pixels.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Analyze the input grid to identify all unique non-white color values present.
    2.  Count the number of these unique non-white colors. This count is the scaling factor, `N`.
    3.  Determine the dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) of the input grid.
    4.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (`N * H`, `N * W`).
    5.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid at row `r` and column `c` (from `r=0` to `H-1`, `c=0` to `W-1`). Let the color of this input pixel be `C`.
    6.  Consider the corresponding `N x N` block in the output grid, which spans rows from `N * r` to `N * r + N - 1` and columns from `N * c` to `N * c + N - 1`.
    7.  If the input pixel color `C` is white (0):
        a.  Fill this entire `N x N` block in the output grid with white (0).
        b.  Iterate `i` from 0 to `N - 1`. Set the pixel at output coordinates (`N * r + i`, `N * c + i`) to red (2).
    8.  If the input pixel color `C` is not white (i.e., `C > 0`):
        a.  Fill this entire `N x N` block in the output grid with the color `C`.
    9.  The resulting grid is the final output.
