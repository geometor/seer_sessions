## General Assessment

The provided Python code attempted to implement a transformation rule observed primarily from the first example. The core logic involved:
1.  Determining a scaling factor `N` based on the count of unique non-white colors in the input.
2.  Scaling the input grid dimensions by `N` to create the output grid.
3.  Mapping each input pixel to an `N x N` block in the output grid.
4.  Filling the block with the input pixel's color if it was non-white.
5.  Filling the block with white and placing red pixels on the *main diagonal* if the input pixel was white.

The execution results show that while the scaling factor calculation and the transformation of non-white pixels were correct, the rule for transforming white pixels was flawed. The code placed red pixels along the main diagonal of the `N x N` blocks, whereas the expected outputs clearly show red pixels along the *anti-diagonal* for blocks corresponding to white input pixels.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to correct the specific part of the logic that handles white input pixels, changing the placement of red pixels from the main diagonal to the anti-diagonal within the corresponding `N x N` block.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's verify the scaling factor N for each example and re-examine the white pixel transformation pattern.


``` python
import numpy as np

# --- Example 1 ---
input_1 = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 7],
    [4, 4, 0, 0, 7],
    [4, 4, 0, 0, 6],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 6],
    [7, 7, 6, 6, 6]
])
unique_colors_1 = np.unique(input_1)
non_white_colors_1 = unique_colors_1[unique_colors_1 != 0]
n_1 = len(non_white_colors_1)
print(f"Example 1: Input shape={input_1.shape}, Non-white colors={non_white_colors_1}, N={n_1}")

# --- Example 2 ---
input_2 = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
    [0, 8, 8, 0, 3],
    [0, 8, 8, 0, 3],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
])
unique_colors_2 = np.unique(input_2)
non_white_colors_2 = unique_colors_2[unique_colors_2 != 0]
n_2 = len(non_white_colors_2)
print(f"Example 2: Input shape={input_2.shape}, Non-white colors={non_white_colors_2}, N={n_2}")

# --- Example 3 ---
input_3 = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 9],
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 9],
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 3],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
    [9, 9, 3, 3, 4]
])
unique_colors_3 = np.unique(input_3)
non_white_colors_3 = unique_colors_3[unique_colors_3 != 0]
n_3 = len(non_white_colors_3)
print(f"Example 3: Input shape={input_3.shape}, Non-white colors={non_white_colors_3}, N={n_3}")
```
```
Example 1: Input shape=(5, 5), Non-white colors=[4 6 7], N=3
Example 2: Input shape=(5, 5), Non-white colors=[3 8], N=2
Example 3: Input shape=(5, 5), Non-white colors=[1 3 4 9], N=4

```
**Analysis:**

*   **Scaling Factor (N):** The calculation `N = count of unique non-white colors` is consistent across all examples (N=3, N=2, N=4 respectively). The output grid dimensions correctly scale by N (5x5 -> 15x15, 5x5 -> 10x10, 5x5 -> 20x20).
*   **Non-White Pixels:** Input pixels with color C > 0 are expanded into an `N x N` block filled entirely with color C in the output. This appears correct in all examples.
*   **White Pixels (Error Location):**
    *   **Example 1 (N=3):** Input white (0) at (0,0) maps to a 3x3 block at (0,0) in the output. The *expected* output has red (2) at (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) - the anti-diagonal. The *transformed* output incorrectly placed red at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) - the main diagonal.
    *   **Example 2 (N=2):** Input white (0) at (0,0) maps to a 2x2 block at (0,0) in the output. The *expected* output has red (2) at (0,1), (1,0) - the anti-diagonal. The *transformed* output incorrectly placed red at (0,0), (1,1) - the main diagonal.
    *   **Example 3 (N=4):** Input white (0) at (0,0) maps to a 4x4 block at (0,0) in the output. The *expected* output has red (2) at (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0) - the anti-diagonal. The *transformed* output incorrectly placed red at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) - the main diagonal.

**Conclusion:** The only required change is modifying the rule for white pixels to use the anti-diagonal instead of the main diagonal for placing red pixels.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Grid Upscaling with Pattern Insertion

Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Type: 2D array of integers (0-9 representing colors)
    - Size: Variable height and width (H_in, W_in)
    - Contains: Pixels with specific colors.

Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Type: 2D array of integers (0-9 representing colors)
    - Size: Scaled dimensions (H_out, W_out)
    - Derived_From: Input_Grid

Parameters:
  - Name: Scaling Factor (N)
    Value: Count of unique non-white (non-zero) colors in the Input_Grid.
    Calculation: `N = len(unique(Input_Grid[Input_Grid != 0]))`
  - Name: Output Dimensions
    Calculation:
      - `H_out = N * H_in`
      - `W_out = N * W_in`

Transformation_Rule:
  - For each pixel `P_in` at `(r, c)` in Input_Grid with color `C`:
      - Identify the corresponding `N x N` block `B_out` in Output_Grid, starting at `(N*r, N*c)`.
      - If `C` is non-white (`C > 0`):
          - Action: Fill `B_out` entirely with color `C`.
      - If `C` is white (`C == 0`):
          - Action 1: Fill `B_out` entirely with white (0).
          - Action 2: Set pixels on the anti-diagonal within `B_out` to red (2).
            - Anti-diagonal coordinates within the block (local coordinates `i, j` where `0 <= i < N`, `0 <= j < N`) satisfy `j = N - 1 - i`.
            - Corresponding Output_Grid coordinates: `(N*r + i, N*c + N - 1 - i)` for `i` from 0 to `N-1`.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Analyze the input grid to determine the scaling factor `N` by counting the number of unique colors present, excluding white (color 0). If no non-white colors exist, assume `N=1`.
2.  Calculate the dimensions of the output grid: `output_height = N * input_height`, `output_width = N * input_width`.
3.  Create an empty output grid of the calculated dimensions, initially filled with white (0).
4.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at coordinates `(r, c)`. Let the color of this input pixel be `C`.
5.  Determine the top-left starting coordinates `(start_row, start_col)` for the corresponding `N x N` block in the output grid: `start_row = N * r`, `start_col = N * c`.
6.  If the input pixel color `C` is non-white (`C > 0`):
    *   Fill the entire `N x N` block in the output grid, from `(start_row, start_col)` to `(start_row + N - 1, start_col + N - 1)`, with color `C`.
7.  If the input pixel color `C` is white (`C == 0`):
    *   The `N x N` block in the output grid remains filled with white (as initialized in step 3).
    *   Iterate from `i = 0` to `N - 1`. For each `i`, set the pixel at output grid coordinates `(start_row + i, start_col + N - 1 - i)` to red (color 2). This places red pixels along the anti-diagonal of the block.
8.  Return the completed output grid.
