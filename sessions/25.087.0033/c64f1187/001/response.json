Identifying instances in the lower part and applying the corresponding templates to an output grid.\n\nFirst, the upper region of the input grid is scanned to find 'template colors' (non-white, non-grey, non-blue pixels). For each template color, the 2x2 area directly below it is examined to find a 3-pixel 'L' shape made of blue pixels. This blue L-shape pattern is stored in a map associated with the template color.\n\nSecond, the lower region (typically containing grey pixels) is scanned to find grey 'L' shapes (3 grey pixels). The pixel inside the 'corner' of each grey L is identified as the 'content pixel'. If the content pixel's color is not grey, its color and the location of the grey L are recorded.\n\nThird, the relative grid layout of these valid grey L instances is determined. Assuming a regular spacing (e.g., 3x3 blocks), relative row and column indices are calculated for each instance based on its position relative to the top-leftmost instance.\n\nFourth, an output grid is constructed. Its size is determined by the maximum relative row and column indices found. For each recorded instance, the template shape corresponding to its content color is retrieved from the map. This shape is then drawn onto the output grid at a position determined by the instance's relative row and column indices, scaled by the assumed block size (e.g., row * 3, col * 3). The shape is drawn using the content color.\n\nFinally, the completed output grid is returned.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_templates(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans the upper part of the grid to find color->shape template mappings.\n    A template is defined by a non-white/grey/blue color pixel followed\n    by a 2x2 blue L-shape below it.\n    \"\"\"\n    templates = {}\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    \n    # Determine the boundary row (heuristic: first row with a grey pixel)\n    split_row = height\n    for r in range(height):\n        if 5 in grid[r, :]:\n            split_row = r\n            break\n            \n    for r in range(split_row - 1): # Need space for the 2x2 below\n        for c in range(width - 1): # Need space for the 2x2 below\n            template_color = grid[r, c]\n            # Check if it's a potential template color marker\n            if template_color not in [0, 1, 5]: \n                # Check the 2x2 area below\n                if r + 2 < height and c + 1 < width:\n                    sub_grid = grid[r+1:r+3, c:c+2]\n                    # Check if it contains exactly 3 blue pixels (value 1)\n                    if np.count_nonzero(sub_grid == 1) == 3:\n                        # Store the shape (1 for blue, 0 otherwise)\n                        shape = (sub_grid == 1).astype(int)\n                        templates[template_color] = shape\n                        # print(f\"Found template: color={template_color} at ({r},{c}), shape=\\n{shape}\") # Debug\n    return templates\n\ndef find_instances(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans the lower part of the grid to find grey L-shapes and their content pixels.\n    Returns a list of tuples: (content_color, top_left_y, top_left_x) for valid instances.\n    A grey L is 3 grey pixels.
