Identify marker pixels (colors other than white(0), blue(1), grey(5)). For each marker pixel at `(r, c)`, extract the 2x2 shape directly below it (`rows r+1` to `r+2`, `cols c` to `c+1`). Convert this 2x2 shape into a binary template (1 where the color is blue(1), 0 otherwise). Store a mapping from the marker color to its binary template.\n\n2.  **Instance Identification**: Scan the lower part of the input grid (starting from the first row containing grey(5)). Find all 2x2 blocks that consist of exactly 3 grey(5) pixels forming an 'L' shape, surrounding a single non-grey 'content' pixel. Record the color of the content pixel and the top-left coordinates `(y, x)` of the 2x2 block for each valid instance.\n\n3.  **Layout Calculation**: If no instances are found, return a 1x1 grid containing white(0). Otherwise, determine the top-most (`min_y`) and left-most (`min_x`) coordinates among all found instance blocks. Calculate the relative row (`rel_r`) and column (`rel_c`) for each instance based on its position relative to `(min_y, min_x)`, assuming a grid spacing of 3 pixels (i.e., `rel_r = (y - min_y) // 3`, `rel_c = (x - min_x) // 3`). Find the maximum relative row (`max_rel_r`) and column (`max_rel_c`) across all instances.\n\n4.  **Output Grid Construction**: Define the size of the template shapes (assumed to be 2x2, `shape_h=2`, `shape_w=2`) and the spacing/block size (`BLOCK_SIZE=3`). Calculate the output grid dimensions: `height = max_rel_r * BLOCK_SIZE + shape_h`, `width = max_rel_c * BLOCK_SIZE + shape_w`. Initialize an output grid of this size with white pixels (0).\n\n5.  **Drawing Shapes**: Iterate through the found instances. For each instance `(color, y, x)` with relative coordinates `(rel_r, rel_c)`:\n    *   Check if a template exists for the instance `color`.\n    *   If a template exists, retrieve the binary template.\n    *   Calculate the top-left drawing position in the output grid: `out_y = rel_r * BLOCK_SIZE`, `out_x = rel_c * BLOCK_SIZE`.\n    *   Draw the template onto the output grid at `(out_y, out_x)`. Where the template has a 1, place the instance `color` in the output grid cell `(out_y + template_row, out_x + template_col)`.\n\n6.  **Return** the final output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_templates(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans the upper part of the grid to find color->shape template mappings.\n    A template is defined by a non-white/grey/blue color pixel, and the\n    2x2 pattern of blue pixels directly below it.\n    \"\"\"\n    templates = {}\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    \n    # Determine the boundary row (heuristic: first row with a grey pixel)\n    split_row = height\n    for r in range(height):\n        if 5 in grid[r, :]:\n            split_row = r\n            break\n            \n    # Scan for template markers above the split row\n    for r in range(split_row - 1): # Need space for the 2x2 below\n        for c in range(width - 1): # Need space for the 2x2 below\n            template_color = grid[r, c]\n            # Check if it's a potential template color marker\n            if template_color not in [0, 1, 5]: \n                # Check if there's space for the 2x2 area below\n                if r + 2 < height and c + 1 < width:\n                    # Extract the 2x2 area below\n                    sub_grid = grid[r+1:r+3, c:c+2]\n                    # Store the shape (1 for blue, 0 otherwise)\n                    # Only store if there is at least one blue pixel?
