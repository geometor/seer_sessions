            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grid appears divided into two main conceptual regions:\n    *   **Upper Region:** Contains relatively sparse, non-grey/non-blue colored pixels (like red, green, orange, yellow, azure). Below each of these specific colored pixels, there's often a small L-shape composed of 3 blue pixels within a 2x2 area. This suggests the upper region defines associations between colors and specific L-shapes.\n    *   **Lower Region:** Contains multiple instances of L-shapes made of grey pixels. Crucially, inside the 'corner' of each grey L-shape, there's a single pixel of a different color (sometimes grey, sometimes one of the colors seen in the upper region). These seem to represent instances or data points.\n\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is generally smaller than the input. It contains L-shapes matching the *colors* found inside the grey Ls from the input's lower region. The *shape* of each output L seems determined by the blue L-shape associated with that color in the input's upper region. The arrangement of these colored L-shapes in the output corresponds to the relative arrangement of the grey L-shapes in the input.\n\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves:\n    *   **Template Definition:** Using the upper region to create a mapping from a specific color to a specific 2x2 L-shape pattern (defined by the blue pixels below it).\n    *   **Instance Identification:** Finding all grey L-shapes in the lower region and extracting the 'content' color pixel from inside each one.\n    *   **Shape Construction:** For each grey L instance with a non-grey content color, look up the L-shape template associated with that content color (from the upper region mapping).\n    *   **Output Generation:** Create a new grid and place the constructed L-shapes (using the content color and the template shape) onto it. The placement preserves the relative spatial grid layout observed among the grey L-shapes in the input, with some spacing (looks like 3x3 cells allocated per shape). Grey Ls with grey content colors are ignored.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

This 3-pixel blue pattern is the `template_shape`.\n    *   Store a mapping: `template_color` -> `template_shape`.\n\n2.  **Identify Instances:**\n    *   Scan the bottom portion of the input grid (e.g., rows from the first grey pixel downwards).\n    *   Find all occurrences of grey (5) L-shapes (3 grey pixels connected at a corner).\n    *   For each grey L-shape, find the pixel immediately inside its corner (the pixel adjacent to two of the grey L pixels). Let this be the `content_pixel`.\n    *   If the `content_pixel`'s color is *not* grey (5), record its color (`content_color`) and its location (`content_location`).\n\n3.  **Determine Relative Layout:**\n    *   Collect all recorded `content_location` coordinates.\n    *   Identify the minimum row (`min_y`) and minimum column (`min_x`) among these locations.\n    *   Observe the spacing between these locations (it appears to be 3 units vertically and horizontally in the examples).\n    *   For each `content_location` (y, x), calculate its relative grid index: `relative_row = (y - min_y) // 3`, `relative_col = (x - min_x) // 3`.\n\n4.  **Construct Output Grid:**\n    *   Determine the required size of the output grid based on the maximum `relative_row` and `relative_col` found (e.g., `height = (max_row + 1) * 3`, `width = (max_col + 1) * 3`). Initialize the output grid with white (0).\n    *   For each recorded instance (with `content_color`, `relative_row`, `relative_col`):\n        *   Look up the `template_shape` associated with the `content_color` using the map created in Step 1.\n        *   Calculate the top-left coordinates for placing this shape in the output grid: `output_y = relative_row * 3`, `output_x = relative_col * 3`.\n        *   Place the `template_shape` at (`output_y`, `output_x`) in the output grid. Replace the pixels corresponding to the blue pattern in the template with the `content_color`. Leave the other pixel(s) in the 2x2 area as white (0).\n\n5.  **Finalize:** The resulting grid is the final output."
