elements:
  - object: MainRedObject
    description: The largest contiguous area of red (2) pixels in the input grid. It often contains internal holes.
    properties: [color: red, shape: variable, contains_holes: often true]
  - object: StampObject
    description: Smaller contiguous objects made of non-red, non-white colors, located separately from the MainRedObject.
    properties: [color: various (non-red, non-white), shape: specific pattern, size: smaller than MainRedObject]
  - object: WhiteHole
    description: Contiguous areas of white (0) pixels located inside the MainRedObject's boundary, surrounded by red pixels.
    properties: [color: white, shape: specific pattern, location: inside MainRedObject]
  - object: Background
    description: Pixels with color white (0) surrounding the main objects.
    properties: [color: white]

actions:
  - action: IdentifyAndLocate
    target: MainRedObject
    result: Bounding box coordinates and pixel map of the MainRedObject.
  - action: IdentifyAndLocate
    target: StampObjects
    result: List of StampObjects, each with its bounding box, shape (relative coordinates), and pattern (relative coordinates to color map).
  - action: IdentifyAndLocate
    target: WhiteHoles
    result: List of WhiteHoles within the MainRedObject, each with its shape (relative coordinates within MainRedObject's bounding box) and location.
  - action: MatchShapes
    source: WhiteHole shapes
    target: StampObject shapes
    result: Pairing of WhiteHoles with StampObjects that have identical shapes (set of relative coordinates).
  - action: FillHole
    target: WhiteHole in an intermediate output grid (initially a copy of the MainRedObject)
    using: Pattern (colors and relative positions) from the matched StampObject.
    result: The WhiteHole area in the intermediate output grid is replaced with the StampObject's pattern.
  - action: Crop
    target: MainRedObject (after holes are filled)
    using: Bounding box of the MainRedObject.
    result: The final output grid.

relationships:
  - type: ShapeEquivalence
    between: WhiteHole, StampObject
    description: A WhiteHole's shape (relative pixel coordinates) must exactly match a StampObject's shape (relative pixel coordinates within its own bounding box) for a fill operation to occur.
  - type: Containment
    container: MainRedObject
    contains: WhiteHoles
  - type: PositionalCorrespondence
    between: WhiteHole pixels, StampObject pixels
    description: When filling a hole, the color of a pixel in the StampObject pattern is applied to the pixel at the corresponding relative position within the WhiteHole area in the output.
