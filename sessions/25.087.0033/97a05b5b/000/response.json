            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain a large, prominent object made of red (2) pixels. This red object often has internal \"holes\" filled with white (0) pixels. Additionally, scattered elsewhere in the input grid (usually separated by white pixels) are smaller, distinct objects made of various other colors (yellow, green, blue, gray, azure). The overall grid includes significant areas of white background pixels (0).\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is smaller than the input grid. It appears to be a cropped version derived from the large red object in the input. The output grid maintains the basic shape of the red object but the internal white holes are now filled with colors corresponding to the smaller objects found in the input.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve:\n    *   Identifying the main red object.\n    *   Identifying the smaller \"pattern\" or \"stamp\" objects.\n    *   Locating the white holes *within* the main red object.\n    *   Matching the *shape* of each white hole to the *shape* of one of the stamp objects.\n    *   \"Painting\" or filling the white hole in the red object with the colors from the matched stamp object, preserving the relative arrangement of colors.\n    *   The final output is the modified red object, cropped to its bounding box.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
