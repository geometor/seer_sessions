            "text": "*   **Perception:**\n    The task involves identifying specific trigger pixels in the input grid and drawing a predefined, complex pattern centered around each trigger pixel in the output grid. The input grids contain one or more green (3) pixels scattered on a white (0) background. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input. For every green pixel in the input, a specific multi-colored structure is drawn in the output, centered at the location of the original green pixel. This structure consists of gray (5), red (2), and azure (8) pixels arranged in lines and specific points relative to the center. A key feature is a horizontal red line segment at the bottom of the structure that extends left and right from the main body of the structure all the way to the vertical edges of the grid. If there are multiple green pixels, the corresponding structures are drawn independently for each, potentially overwriting the background. The examples suggest that the structures themselves don't overlap in ways that cause ambiguity, other than potentially sharing the background color. The original green pixel is preserved at its location within the drawn structure.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
