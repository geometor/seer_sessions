            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consist primarily of a white (0) background and one or more shapes made of gray (5) pixels.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, but some white (0) pixels within the gray shapes are changed to red (2).\n3.  **Key Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying specific regions of white pixels and changing their color to red.\n4.  **Condition for Change:** The white pixels that change to red appear to be those that are completely enclosed or surrounded by gray pixels. If a white area touches the grid boundary or another non-gray pixel area that isn't part of the enclosing shape, it's not filled.\n5.  **Objects:** The primary objects are the contiguous shapes formed by gray pixels. Secondary objects are the regions of white pixels inside these gray shapes.\n6.  **Consistency:** Across all examples, the gray shapes themselves remain unchanged. Only the color of *some* interior white pixels changes. Example `train_3` shows that if there are no fully enclosed white areas within the gray shapes, the output is identical to the input.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels in the input grid.\n3.  For each white region, determine if it is fully enclosed by one or more gray shapes. A white region is considered fully enclosed if every path from any pixel within that white region to the boundary of the grid must pass through at least one gray pixel.\n4.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n5.  For every white region identified in step 3 as being fully enclosed, change the color of all pixels within that region in the output grid to red (2).\n6.  Leave all other pixels (gray pixels and non-enclosed white pixels) unchanged from their input grid colors."
