"""
Identifies contiguous regions of white (0) pixels that are fully enclosed (not reachable 
from the grid boundary via white pixels). For each such enclosed white region, it checks 
if its bounding box is a square and if the region completely fills its bounding box 
(i.e., the number of white pixels in the region equals the area of the bounding box). 
If both conditions are true, the white pixels of that region are changed to red (2) 
in the output grid. All other pixels remain unchanged.
