"""
Identifies yellow (4) and magenta (6) objects in the input grid.
Determines the aspect ratio (height vs. width) of the magenta object's bounding box.
If the magenta object's height is greater than or equal to its width, perform a horizontal reflection of the yellow object. The reflection axis is the vertical line immediately to the right of the yellow object's bounding box (x = max_col_yellow + 0.5).
If the magenta object's height is less than its width, perform a vertical reflection of the yellow object. The reflection axis depends on the relative horizontal positions of the objects' centers:
- If the magenta object's center is horizontally to the right of the yellow object's center, the axis is the horizontal line immediately above the yellow object's bounding box (y = min_row_yellow - 0.5).
- Otherwise (magenta center is left or aligned), the axis is the horizontal line immediately below the yellow object's bounding box (y = max_row_yellow + 0.5).
The output grid contains the original yellow object combined with its reflection. The magenta object is removed (replaced with the background color 0).
If either the yellow or magenta object is missing, the output is the input grid with the magenta object (if any) removed.
