            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids have three main components:\n    *   A sequence of colors in the top row (row 0).\n    *   A solid line of gray pixels (color 5) in the second row (row 1).\n    *   A single, isolated non-white pixel located somewhere below the first two rows (the \"target pixel\").\n    *   The rest of the grid is white (color 0).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the top two rows (sometimes with a single pixel modification in the top row) and replace the area around the original target pixel with a structure of concentric square frames.\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The isolated target pixel from the input determines the center point and the color of the centermost pixel in the output structure.\n    *   The sequence of colors in the input's top row determines the colors of the concentric frames. Specifically, the *last* non-white color in the top row defines the outermost frame's color. The sequence of non-white colors *before* this last color contributes to the inner frame colors.\n    *   The colors used for the layers (center + frames) seem to be a unique, sorted combination of the target pixel's color, the sequence of colors before the last one in the top row, and the last color in the top row itself. The order goes from the target color at the center, then colors from the sequence, and finally the last top-row color for the outermost frame.\n    *   The frames are square, centered on the target pixel's original location, and expand outwards with a one-pixel gap between each frame.\n    *   A conditional change occurs in the top row: If the pixel immediately to the *left* of the last non-white color pixel in the input's top row is white (0), then that last non-white color pixel is replaced by gray (5 - the color from the row below it) in the output. Otherwise, the top row remains unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Store its color as `target_color` and its position (row, col) as `center_pos`.\n3.  **Analyze Top Row:**\n    a.  Find the column index (`frame_col`) of the rightmost non-white pixel in row 0. Store its color as `frame_color`.\n    b.  Collect all non-white pixel colors in row 0 located at columns less than `frame_col`. Store these as a list `sequence_colors`.\n4.  **Determine Layer Colors:**\n    a.  Create a list of unique colors from `sequence_colors`.\n    b.  Sort this unique list in ascending order.\n    c.  Construct the final ordered list of layer colors: `layer_colors = [target_color] + sorted_unique_sequence_colors + [frame_color]`.\n    d.  Remove duplicate colors from `layer_colors` while preserving the order established in step 4c.\n5.  **Modify Top Row (Conditional):**\n    a.  Check if `frame_col > 0`.\n    b.  If yes, check the color of the pixel at `(0, frame_col - 1)` in the *input* grid.\n    c.  If this pixel's color is white (0), get the color of the pixel at `(1, frame_col)` from the *input* grid (which should be gray, 5) and update the *output* grid at position `(0, frame_col)` with this gray color.\n6.  **Construct Concentric Structure:**\n    a.  Set the pixel at `center_pos` in the *output* grid to the first color in `layer_colors`.\n    b.  For each subsequent color in `layer_colors` (let the index of the color in the list be `i`, starting from `i=1` for the second color / first frame):\n        i.  Calculate the bounding box for the `i`-th frame:\n            *   `top = center_pos.row - i`\n            *   `bottom = center_pos.row + i`\n            *   `left = center_pos.col - i`\n            *   `right = center_pos.col + i`\n        ii. Draw a hollow square frame using the current color within these bounds on the *output* grid. This involves coloring the pixels along the top row (from `left` to `right`), bottom row (from `left` to `right`), left column (from `top` to `bottom`), and right column (from `top` to `bottom`) within the bounding box. Ensure the frame does not overwrite pixels closer to the center that belong to inner layers.\n7.  **Finalize:** Return the modified output grid."
