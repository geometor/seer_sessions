Observations:
  - Input and Output grids are the same size (16x16 in examples).
  - Background color is white (0).
  - Row 1 is consistently filled with gray (5).
  - Row 0 contains a sequence of non-white colors followed by white pixels.
  - A single non-white "target" pixel exists elsewhere in the input grid (below row 1).

Input Elements:
  - Target Pixel:
    - Properties: color (target_color), position (center_pos).
    - Identification: The only non-white pixel not in row 0 or row 1.
  - Top Row Sequence:
    - Properties: A list of colors, position (row 0).
    - Structure: Contains non-white colors, potentially separated by white (0).
  - Frame Color Source:
    - Properties: color (frame_color), position (0, frame_col).
    - Identification: The rightmost non-white pixel in row 0.
  - Inner Frame Colors Source:
    - Properties: List of colors (sequence_colors).
    - Identification: Non-white pixels in row 0 to the left of frame_col.
  - Modifier Condition Pixel:
    - Properties: color, position (0, frame_col - 1).
    - Identification: The pixel immediately left of the Frame Color Source pixel.
  - Replacement Color Source:
    - Properties: color (always gray 5 in examples), position (1, frame_col).
    - Identification: The pixel directly below the Frame Color Source pixel.

Output Elements:
  - Modified Top Row: Identical to input row 0, unless the Modifier Condition Pixel is white (0), in which case the pixel at (0, frame_col) is changed to gray (5).
  - Row 1: Identical to input row 1 (all gray 5).
  - Concentric Structure:
    - Center: Pixel at center_pos with target_color.
    - Frames: Hollow square frames drawn around the center.
      - Colors: Determined by a unique, sorted combination derived from target_color, sequence_colors, and frame_color. The order is target_color (center), sorted unique sequence_colors, frame_color (outermost).
      - Geometry: Each frame `i` (starting i=1 for the first frame) extends `i` pixels out from the center position (creating frames of size 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, etc.). There is a 1-pixel gap between frames.

Relationships & Actions:
  - The target_color defines the center of the output structure.
  - The frame_color defines the color of the outermost frame.
  - The sequence_colors, combined with target_color and frame_color, define the colors of all layers (center + frames) in a specific order.
  - The color of the Modifier Condition Pixel determines if a pixel in the output's top row is changed.
  - Concentric frames are drawn sequentially outwards from the center_pos.
