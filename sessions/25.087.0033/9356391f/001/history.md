Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids have three main components:
    *   A sequence of colors in the top row (row 0).
    *   A solid line of gray pixels (color 5) in the second row (row 1).
    *   A single, isolated non-white pixel located somewhere below the first two rows (the "target pixel").
    *   The rest of the grid is white (color 0).
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the top two rows (sometimes with a single pixel modification in the top row) and replace the area around the original target pixel with a structure of concentric square frames.
3.  **Transformation:**
    *   The isolated target pixel from the input determines the center point and the color of the centermost pixel in the output structure.
    *   The sequence of colors in the input's top row determines the colors of the concentric frames. Specifically, the *last* non-white color in the top row defines the outermost frame's color. The sequence of non-white colors *before* this last color contributes to the inner frame colors.
    *   The colors used for the layers (center + frames) seem to be a unique, sorted combination of the target pixel's color, the sequence of colors before the last one in the top row, and the last color in the top row itself. The order goes from the target color at the center, then colors from the sequence, and finally the last top-row color for the outermost frame.
    *   The frames are square, centered on the target pixel's original location, and expand outwards with a one-pixel gap between each frame.
    *   A conditional change occurs in the top row: If the pixel immediately to the *left* of the last non-white color pixel in the input's top row is white (0), then that last non-white color pixel is replaced by gray (5 - the color from the row below it) in the output. Otherwise, the top row remains unchanged.

## Facts


```yaml
Observations:
  - Input and Output grids are the same size (16x16 in examples).
  - Background color is white (0).
  - Row 1 is consistently filled with gray (5).
  - Row 0 contains a sequence of non-white colors followed by white pixels.
  - A single non-white "target" pixel exists elsewhere in the input grid (below row 1).

Input Elements:
  - Target Pixel:
    - Properties: color (target_color), position (center_pos).
    - Identification: The only non-white pixel not in row 0 or row 1.
  - Top Row Sequence:
    - Properties: A list of colors, position (row 0).
    - Structure: Contains non-white colors, potentially separated by white (0).
  - Frame Color Source:
    - Properties: color (frame_color), position (0, frame_col).
    - Identification: The rightmost non-white pixel in row 0.
  - Inner Frame Colors Source:
    - Properties: List of colors (sequence_colors).
    - Identification: Non-white pixels in row 0 to the left of frame_col.
  - Modifier Condition Pixel:
    - Properties: color, position (0, frame_col - 1).
    - Identification: The pixel immediately left of the Frame Color Source pixel.
  - Replacement Color Source:
    - Properties: color (always gray 5 in examples), position (1, frame_col).
    - Identification: The pixel directly below the Frame Color Source pixel.

Output Elements:
  - Modified Top Row: Identical to input row 0, unless the Modifier Condition Pixel is white (0), in which case the pixel at (0, frame_col) is changed to gray (5).
  - Row 1: Identical to input row 1 (all gray 5).
  - Concentric Structure:
    - Center: Pixel at center_pos with target_color.
    - Frames: Hollow square frames drawn around the center.
      - Colors: Determined by a unique, sorted combination derived from target_color, sequence_colors, and frame_color. The order is target_color (center), sorted unique sequence_colors, frame_color (outermost).
      - Geometry: Each frame `i` (starting i=1 for the first frame) extends `i` pixels out from the center position (creating frames of size 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, etc.). There is a 1-pixel gap between frames.

Relationships & Actions:
  - The target_color defines the center of the output structure.
  - The frame_color defines the color of the outermost frame.
  - The sequence_colors, combined with target_color and frame_color, define the colors of all layers (center + frames) in a specific order.
  - The color of the Modifier Condition Pixel determines if a pixel in the output's top row is changed.
  - Concentric frames are drawn sequentially outwards from the center_pos.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialization:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  **Identify Target:** Locate the single non-white pixel that is not in row 0 or row 1. Store its color as `target_color` and its position (row, col) as `center_pos`.
3.  **Analyze Top Row:**
    a.  Find the column index (`frame_col`) of the rightmost non-white pixel in row 0. Store its color as `frame_color`.
    b.  Collect all non-white pixel colors in row 0 located at columns less than `frame_col`. Store these as a list `sequence_colors`.
4.  **Determine Layer Colors:**
    a.  Create a list of unique colors from `sequence_colors`.
    b.  Sort this unique list in ascending order.
    c.  Construct the final ordered list of layer colors: `layer_colors = [target_color] + sorted_unique_sequence_colors + [frame_color]`.
    d.  Remove duplicate colors from `layer_colors` while preserving the order established in step 4c.
5.  **Modify Top Row (Conditional):**
    a.  Check if `frame_col > 0`.
    b.  If yes, check the color of the pixel at `(0, frame_col - 1)` in the *input* grid.
    c.  If this pixel's color is white (0), get the color of the pixel at `(1, frame_col)` from the *input* grid (which should be gray, 5) and update the *output* grid at position `(0, frame_col)` with this gray color.
6.  **Construct Concentric Structure:**
    a.  Set the pixel at `center_pos` in the *output* grid to the first color in `layer_colors`.
    b.  For each subsequent color in `layer_colors` (let the index of the color in the list be `i`, starting from `i=1` for the second color / first frame):
        i.  Calculate the bounding box for the `i`-th frame:
            *   `top = center_pos.row - i`
            *   `bottom = center_pos.row + i`
            *   `left = center_pos.col - i`
            *   `right = center_pos.col + i`
        ii. Draw a hollow square frame using the current color within these bounds on the *output* grid. This involves coloring the pixels along the top row (from `left` to `right`), bottom row (from `left` to `right`), left column (from `top` to `bottom`), and right column (from `top` to `bottom`) within the bounding box. Ensure the frame does not overwrite pixels closer to the center that belong to inner layers.
7.  **Finalize:** Return the modified output grid.
