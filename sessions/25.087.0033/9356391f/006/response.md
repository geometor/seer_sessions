**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code successfully implemented most transformation steps but failed on Example 1 due to an incorrect interpretation of how the outermost frame layer should be drawn. The code drew the frame color conditionally for *all* radii between the last inner layer and the `max_radius` determined from the top row. However, Example 1's expected output shows the frame color should *only* be drawn conditionally at the specific radius equal to `max_radius`. Example 2 worked coincidentally because its `max_radius` happened to be equal to `num_layers - 1`, meaning the incorrect loop effectively ran only once for the correct radius.

The strategy is to correct Step 6b of the transformation rule and the corresponding code implementation. Instead of looping through multiple radii for the conditional frame drawing, it should target only the single radius `max_radius`.

**Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Size: 16x16
    *   Target: Color=2, Position=(11, 5)
    *   Top Row: Frame Color=8, Max Radius=5, Sequence Colors=[2, 3, 3, 4]
    *   Layer Colors: [2, 3, 4, 8] (num_layers=4)
    *   Top Row Mod: Applied (Pixel (0, 5) -> 5)
    *   Failure: Outer frame (color 8) was drawn conditionally at radii 3, 4, and 5. Should only be drawn conditionally at radius 5.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Size: 16x16
    *   Target: Color=1, Position=(9, 6)
    *   Top Row: Frame Color=6, Max Radius=3, Sequence Colors=[1, 2, 3]
    *   Layer Colors: [1, 2, 3, 6] (num_layers=4)
    *   Top Row Mod: Not Applied
    *   Success: Outer frame (color 6) was drawn conditionally only at radius 3 (because `num_layers - 1 == max_radius`).

**Natural Language Program (Revised):**

1.  **Initialize Output:** Create an identical copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  **Identify Target:** Locate the single non-white pixel (`target_color`) in the input grid at or below row 2 (index 2). Record its position (`center_r`, `center_c`). If no such pixel exists, return the initial output grid copy.
3.  **Analyze Top Row (Row 0):**
    a.  Find the rightmost non-white pixel. If none exists, return the initial output grid copy. Otherwise, record its color (`frame_color`) and column index (`max_radius`).
    b.  Collect the colors of all non-white pixels in row 0 located to the left of the `frame_color` pixel. Record these as `sequence_colors`.
4.  **Determine Layer Colors:** Construct an ordered list of unique colors (`layer_colors`) for the concentric structure:
    a.  Start with `target_color`.
    b.  Append the unique colors from `sequence_colors`, sorted numerically (by color value).
    c.  Append `frame_color`.
    d.  Remove any duplicate colors from this combined list while preserving the relative order established in steps a-c. Let the final number of unique colors be `num_layers`. If `num_layers` is 0 (e.g., if only white was found, which shouldn't happen with valid inputs), return the initial output grid copy.
5.  **Modify Top Row (Conditional):** Check if `max_radius` is greater than 0 and if the pixel at `(0, max_radius - 1)` in the *input* grid is white (0).
    a.  If both conditions are true and row 1 exists in the grid, change the color of the pixel at `(0, max_radius)` in the *output* grid to the color of the pixel directly below it in the *input* grid (i.e., the color at `(1, max_radius)`).
6.  **Construct Concentric Structure:**
    a.  **Draw Inner Layers:** Iterate through radii `r` from 0 up to `num_layers - 2` (inclusive).
        i.  If `r` exceeds `max_radius`, stop drawing inner layers.
        ii. Determine the color for the current radius `r`: `inner_color = layer_colors[r]`.
        iii. Draw a hollow square frame using `inner_color`. The frame consists of all pixels exactly at a Chebyshev distance of `r` from the center (`center_r`, `center_c`). Ensure the drawing stays within the grid boundaries. Pixels drawn *overwrite* any existing colors at those locations in the output grid.
    b.  **Draw Outer Frame:** Check if `max_radius` is greater than or equal to `num_layers - 1`.
        i.  If true, determine the frame color: `outer_color = layer_colors[num_layers - 1]` (the last color in the unique list).
        ii. Identify all pixel coordinates `(px_r, px_c)` that are exactly at a Chebyshev distance of `max_radius` from the center (`center_r`, `center_c`) and are within the grid boundaries.
        iii. For each identified pixel `(px_r, px_c)`: If the current color of that pixel in the *output* grid is white (0), change its color to `outer_color`. *Do not* change the color if it is already non-white.
