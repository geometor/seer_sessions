task_description: Draws concentric hollow squares around a target pixel, based on colors and size defined in the top row.
grid_properties:
  - size: Varies (e.g., 16x16)
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object: target_pixel
    description: The single non-white pixel located at row index 2 or greater.
    properties:
      - color: target_color (variable, e.g., 2 in Ex1, 1 in Ex2)
      - position: (center_r, center_c) (variable, e.g., (11, 5) in Ex1, (9, 6) in Ex2)
    role: Defines the center of the concentric structure and the color of the innermost layer (radius 0).
  - object: top_row_pixels
    description: Non-white pixels in row 0 (index 0).
    properties:
      - frame_pixel: The rightmost non-white pixel.
        - color: frame_color (variable, e.g., 8 in Ex1, 6 in Ex2)
        - position: (0, max_radius) (variable, e.g., (0, 5) in Ex1, (0, 3) in Ex2)
        - role: Defines the color and radius of the outermost frame.
      - sequence_pixels: Non-white pixels to the left of the frame_pixel.
        - colors: sequence_colors (list, may contain duplicates, e.g., [2, 3, 3, 4] in Ex1, [1, 2, 3] in Ex2)
        - role: Contribute unique, sorted colors to the inner layers of the concentric structure.
  - object: row_1_pixels
    description: Pixels in row 1 (index 1).
    properties:
      - color: Variable.
      - position: Specifically (1, max_radius).
    role: Used conditionally to modify the color of the frame_pixel in the output grid's top row.
  - object: concentric_structure
    description: A set of nested hollow squares centered around the target_pixel.
    properties:
      - center: (center_r, center_c)
      - layers: Defined by layer_colors.
      - max_radius: Defined by the column index of the frame_pixel.
    role: The primary output structure.
