The type of trigger determines the modification rule.\n\n1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2.  Find all green pixels and determine the set of unique rows containing them (`green_rows`).\n3.  Find all distinct white objects (contiguous areas of white pixels using 8-way connectivity).\n4.  **Check for Green Trigger:** If `green_rows` is not empty:\n    a.  For each white object:\n        i.  Determine the set of rows the object occupies (`white_rows`).\n        ii. Find the rows where this object intersects with `green_rows` (`intersecting_rows`).\n        iii. If `intersecting_rows` is not empty:\n            1. Find the highest row index among the `intersecting_rows` (`highest_intersecting_row`).\n            2. Find the rightmost column index occupied by any pixel in this object (`max_col`).\n            3. Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of this white object:\n                - If the pixel's row `r` is strictly less than `highest_intersecting_row`, change its color to orange (7) in the output grid.\n                - Else if the pixel's column `c` is equal to `max_col`, change its color to magenta (6) in the output grid. (Orange takes precedence).\n    b. Stop and return the modified output grid.\n5.  **Check for Gray Trigger (only if no green trigger occurred):** If `green_rows` was empty:\n    a.  Find all gray pixels and determine the set of unique rows containing them (`gray_rows`).\n    b.  If `gray_rows` is not empty:\n        i.  For each white object:\n            1. Determine the set of rows the object occupies (`white_rows`).\n            2. Find the rows where this object intersects with `gray_rows` (`intersecting_rows`).\n            3. Calculate the object's width (difference between max and min column index + 1).\n            4. If `intersecting_rows` is not empty AND the object's width is 2 or greater:\n                - Find the leftmost column index occupied by any pixel in this object (`min_col`).\n                - Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of this white object:\n                    - If the pixel's column `c` is equal to `min_col`, change its color to magenta (6) in the output grid.\n6.  **Final Output:** Return the output grid (which may be unchanged if no triggers applied, or modified by either the green or gray trigger logic).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_objects(grid, target_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of a specific color in the grid using 8-way connectivity.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        target_color (int): The color of the objects to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[set]: A list where each element is a set of (row, col) tuples\n                   representing the coordinates of pixels in a single object.\n                   Returns an empty list if no objects are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = set()\n    objects = []\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # If the pixel is the target color and hasn't been visited yet\n            if grid[r, c] == target_color and (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_object = set()\n                # Use a queue for Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited.add((r, c))\n\n                while q:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = q.popleft()\n                    current_object.add((curr_r, curr_c))\n\n                    # Check 8 neighbors (including diagonals)\n                    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                            # Skip the center pixel itself\n                            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                                continue\n                            \n                            nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n\n                            # Check if the neighbor is within grid bounds\n                            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                                # Check if the neighbor is the target color and not visited\n                                if grid[nr, nc] == target_color and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                                    visited.add((nr, nc))\n                                    q.append((nr, nc))\n                \n                # Add the found object to the list if it's not empty\n                if current_object: \n                    objects.append(current_object)\n                    \n    return objects\n\ndef get_pixel_locations(grid, target_color):\n    \"\"\"Finds all locations (set of (row, col) tuples) of a specific color.\"\"\"\n    return set(zip(*np.where(grid == target_color)))\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation logic based on green or gray triggers affecting white objects.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
