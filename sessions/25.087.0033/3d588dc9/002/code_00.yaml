task_context:
  description: The task involves conditionally modifying pixels within white objects based on the presence and location of either green or gray pixels/objects. The modification color is magenta, but under specific conditions (green trigger), some white pixels might turn orange.
  background_color: Primarily orange (7), but other colors exist.
  triggers:
    - color: green (3)
    - color: gray (5)
  target_object_color: white (0)
  modification_colors:
    - magenta (6)
    - orange (7)

example_1:
  input_summary: Contains multiple white objects, one green pixel, one gray object.
  trigger: green pixel at (6, 10). Triggering rows: {6}.
  white_objects:
    - id: obj1
      pixels: 14 pixels, including (4,3), (5,3), (6,2)...(9,4)
      location: rows 4-9, cols 2-4
      properties: width=3, height=6
      intersects_trigger_rows: True (row 6)
    - id: obj2
      pixels: 14 pixels, including (13,5)...(15,10)
      location: rows 13-15, cols 5-10
      properties: width=6, height=3
      intersects_trigger_rows: False
  actions:
    - target: obj1
      changes:
        - condition: Pixels in rows strictly above the highest intersecting row (row 6), i.e., rows 4, 5.
          location: (4,3), (5,3)
          new_color: orange (7)
        - condition: Pixels in the maximum column (col 4) within the object.
          location: (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4)
          new_color: magenta (6)
    - target: obj2
      changes: None (does not intersect trigger rows)

example_2:
  input_summary: Contains multiple white objects, one large gray object, no green pixels.
  trigger: gray pixels/object spanning rows 6-9. Triggering rows: {6, 7, 8, 9}.
  white_objects:
    - id: objA
      location: rows 1-3, cols 7-12
      properties: width=6
      intersects_trigger_rows: False
    - id: objB
      location: row 6, col 15
      properties: width=1
      intersects_trigger_rows: True
    - id: objC
      location: rows 7-9, cols 9-14
      properties: width=6
      intersects_trigger_rows: True
  actions:
    - target: objA
      changes: None (does not intersect trigger rows)
    - target: objB
      changes: None (intersects, but width < 2)
    - target: objC
      changes:
        - condition: Pixels in the minimum column (col 9) within the object.
          location: (7,9), (8,9), (9,9)
          new_color: magenta (6)
