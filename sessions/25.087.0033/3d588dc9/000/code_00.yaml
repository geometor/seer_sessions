  rules:
    - condition: Presence of green (3) pixels.
      relationship: Target white (0) object shares at least one row with any green (3) pixel.
      action: Change pixels in the rightmost column of the target white object to magenta (6).
      priority: 1 (highest)
    - condition: Absence of green (3) pixels AND presence of gray (5) object(s).
      relationship: Target white (0) object shares at least one row with any gray (5) object AND has a width >= 2 columns.
      action: Change pixels in the second column from the left (relative to the object's bounding box) of the target white object to magenta (6).
      priority: 2
    - condition: Neither of the above conditions met.
      action: No change.
