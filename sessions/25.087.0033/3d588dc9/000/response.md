Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure**: Both input and output grids are 16x16. The background color is predominantly orange (7).
2.  **Objects**: The grids contain several distinct objects made of contiguous pixels of colors other than the background (orange). These include white (0), blue (1), azure (8), green (3), gray (5), and maroon (9) objects of various shapes and sizes.
3.  **Core Transformation**: The fundamental change between input and output is the modification of *some* white (0) pixels to magenta (6). Not all white pixels are changed.
4.  **Conditional Change**: The location and condition for the change seem to depend on the presence and location of other specific colored pixels in the input grid, specifically green (3) and gray (5).
5.  **Example 1 Analysis**: A green (3) pixel exists. A white (0) object that shares the same row (row 6) as the green pixel undergoes a change. Specifically, the rightmost column of this white object changes from white (0) to magenta (6). Other white objects not sharing a row with the green pixel remain unchanged.
6.  **Example 2 Analysis**: No green (3) pixel exists. A gray (5) object exists. A white (0) object that shares rows (rows 7-9) with the gray object undergoes a change. Specifically, the second column from the left of this white object changes from white (0) to magenta (6). Other white objects (including one that shares a row with the gray object but is only one pixel wide) remain unchanged.
7.  **Inferred Logic**: The transformation targets specific white (0) objects based on their spatial relationship (row overlap) with trigger objects (green or gray). The presence of green (3) takes precedence and dictates a "change rightmost column" rule. If green (3) is absent but gray (5) is present, a "change second column from left" rule applies, potentially with a constraint that the target white object must be at least two columns wide.

    - background_color: 7 # orange
  object_types:
    - color: 0 # white (target of transformation)
    - color: 3 # green (trigger type 1)
    - color: 5 # gray (trigger type 2)
    - color: 1 # blue (static)
    - color: 8 # azure (static)
    - color: 9 # maroon (static)
    - color: 6 # magenta (output color)
    - definition: Contiguous block of same-colored pixels.
  transformation:
    - type: color_change
    - input_color: 0 # white
    - output_color: 6 # magenta
  rules:
    - condition: Presence of green (3) pixels.
      relationship: Target white (0) object shares at least one row with any green (3) pixel.
      action: Change pixels in the rightmost column of the target white object to magenta (6).
      priority: 1 (highest)
    - condition: Absence of green (3) pixels AND presence of gray (5) object(s).
      relationship: Target white (0) object shares at least one row with any gray (5) object AND has a width >= 2 columns.
      action: Change pixels in the second column from the left (relative to the object's bounding box) of the target white object to magenta (6).
      priority: 2
    - condition: Neither of the above conditions met.
      action: No change.
      priority: 3 (lowest)

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct white (0) objects in the input grid. For each object, record its pixel coordinates.
3.  Identify the locations of all green (3) pixels in the input grid.
4.  **Check for Green Trigger:** If one or more green (3) pixels exist:
    a. Determine the set of unique row indices occupied by any green (3) pixel (`GreenRows`).
    b. For each identified white (0) object:
        i. Determine the set of unique row indices occupied by this white object (`WhiteRows`).
        ii. Check if `WhiteRows` shares any common elements with `GreenRows`.
        iii. If they share rows:
            1. Find the maximum column index (`max_col`) among all pixels belonging to this white object.
            2. For every pixel `(r, c)` belonging to this white object where `c` equals `max_col`, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to magenta (6).
5.  **Check for Gray Trigger (if no green found):** If no green (3) pixels exist:
    a. Identify all distinct gray (5) objects in the input grid.
    b. If one or more gray (5) objects exist:
        i. Determine the set of unique row indices occupied by any gray (5) object (`GrayRows`).
        ii. For each identified white (0) object:
            1. Determine the set of unique row indices occupied by this white object (`WhiteRows`).
            2. Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) and maximum column index (`max_col`) among all pixels belonging to this white object. Calculate the object's width (`width = max_col - min_col + 1`).
            3. Check if `WhiteRows` shares any common elements with `GrayRows` AND if `width` is greater than or equal to 2.
            4. If both conditions are true:
                a. Calculate the target column index: `target_col = min_col + 1`.
                b. For every pixel `(r, c)` belonging to this white object where `c` equals `target_col`, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to magenta (6).
6.  Return the final output grid.
