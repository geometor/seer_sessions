            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: Both input and output grids are 16x16. The background color is predominantly orange (7).\n2.  **Objects**: The grids contain several distinct objects made of contiguous pixels of colors other than the background (orange). These include white (0), blue (1), azure (8), green (3), gray (5), and maroon (9) objects of various shapes and sizes.\n3.  **Core Transformation**: The fundamental change between input and output is the modification of *some* white (0) pixels to magenta (6). Not all white pixels are changed.\n4.  **Conditional Change**: The location and condition for the change seem to depend on the presence and location of other specific colored pixels in the input grid, specifically green (3) and gray (5).\n5.  **Example 1 Analysis**: A green (3) pixel exists. A white (0) object that shares the same row (row 6) as the green pixel undergoes a change. Specifically, the rightmost column of this white object changes from white (0) to magenta (6). Other white objects not sharing a row with the green pixel remain unchanged.\n6.  **Example 2 Analysis**: No green (3) pixel exists. A gray (5) object exists. A white (0) object that shares rows (rows 7-9) with the gray object undergoes a change. Specifically, the second column from the left of this white object changes from white (0) to magenta (6). Other white objects (including one that shares a row with the gray object but is only one pixel wide) remain unchanged.\n7.  **Inferred Logic**: The transformation targets specific white (0) objects based on their spatial relationship (row overlap) with trigger objects (green or gray). The presence of green (3) takes precedence and dictates a \"change rightmost column\" rule. If green (3) is absent but gray (5) is present, a \"change second column from left\" rule applies, potentially with a constraint that the target white object must be at least two columns wide.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

For every pixel `(r, c)` belonging to this white object where `c` equals `max_col`, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to magenta (6).\n5.  **Check for Gray Trigger (if no green found):** If no green (3) pixels exist:\n    a.

Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) and maximum column index (`max_col`) among all pixels belonging to this white object. Calculate the object's width (`width = max_col - min_col + 1`).\n            3. Check if `WhiteRows` shares any common elements with `GrayRows` AND if `width` is greater than or equal to 2.\n            4. If both conditions are true:\n                a.

For every pixel `(r, c)` belonging to this white object where `c` equals `target_col`, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to magenta (6).\n6.  Return the final output grid."
