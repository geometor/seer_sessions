task_description: Modifies white objects based on interaction with 'trigger' pixels (green or gray). The type of trigger determines the modification rule.

definitions:
  - name: trigger_pixel
    description: A pixel whose color is green (3) or gray (5).
  - name: white_object
    description: A contiguous area of white (0) pixels (using 8-way connectivity).
  - name: green_trigger_rows
    description: The set of unique row indices containing at least one green pixel.
  - name: gray_trigger_rows
    description: The set of unique row indices containing at least one gray pixel.

  - priority: 3
    condition: No trigger conditions met (no green pixels, or no gray pixels, or no white objects met respective trigger conditions).
    actions:
      - No changes to the grid.

output: The modified grid.
