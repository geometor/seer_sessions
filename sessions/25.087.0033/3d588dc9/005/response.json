Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2.  Identify the locations of all green pixels (color 3) and create a set of unique row indices containing green pixels (`green_rows`).\n3.  Identify all distinct white objects (contiguous areas of color 0, using 8-way connectivity).\n\n4.  **Green Trigger Check:** If `green_rows` is not empty:\n    a.  For each white object:\n        i.  Find the set of row indices occupied by the object (`white_rows`).\n        ii. Check if `white_rows` intersects with `green_rows`. Let the intersection be `intersecting_rows`.\n        iii. If `intersecting_rows` is not empty:\n            1.  Find the maximum column index (`max_col`) within this white object.\n            2.  Identify the highest row index from `intersecting_rows` (`highest_intersecting_row = max(intersecting_rows)`).\n            3.  Iterate through all pixels `(r, c)` belonging to this white object:\n                *   If the pixel's row `r` is strictly less than `highest_intersecting_row`, change its color to orange (7) in the output grid.\n                *   Else if the pixel's column `c` equals `max_col`, change its color to magenta (6) in the output grid. (Orange takes precedence if conditions overlap).\n    b.  Return the output grid immediately after processing all white objects under the green trigger.\n\n5.  **Gray Trigger Check:** If `green_rows` is empty (meaning the green trigger did not activate):\n    a.  Identify the locations of all gray pixels (color 5) and create a set of unique row indices containing gray pixels (`gray_rows`).\n    b.  If `gray_rows` is not empty:\n        i.  For each white object found in step 3:\n            1.  Find the set of row indices occupied by the object (`white_rows`).\n            2.  Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) and maximum column index (`max_col`) within this white object. Calculate its `width = max_col - min_col + 1`.\n            3.  Check if `white_rows` intersects with `gray_rows` AND the object's `width` is 2 or greater.\n            4.  If both conditions are true:\n                *   Iterate through all pixels `(r, c)` belonging to this white object:\n                    *   If the pixel's column `c` equals `min_col`, change its color to magenta (6) in the output grid.\n\n6.  **No Trigger:** If neither the green trigger nor the gray trigger applied (either no green/gray pixels, or no white objects met the trigger conditions), the output grid remains identical to the input grid.\n7.  Return the final output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_objects(grid, target_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of a specific color in the grid using 8-way connectivity.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        target_color (int): The color of the objects to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[set]: A list where each element is a set of (row, col) tuples\n                   representing the coordinates of pixels in a single object.
