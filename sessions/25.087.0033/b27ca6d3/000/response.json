            "text": "**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task takes an input grid containing white (0) and red (2) pixels and produces an output grid of the same dimensions.\n2.  **Color Transformation:** The primary transformation involves changing some white (0) pixels to green (3) pixels in the output. The original red (2) pixels remain unchanged in their positions.\n3.  **Identifying the Trigger:** The appearance of green pixels is related to the configuration of red pixels. Specifically, green pixels appear in the vicinity of red pixels that are adjacent to *other* red pixels.\n4.  **Adjacency:** Adjacency includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors (8-connectivity).\n5.  **Rule:** A white pixel turns green if and only if it is adjacent (8-connectivity) to at least one red pixel *that itself* has at least one adjacent red neighbor. Red pixels that are isolated (having no red neighbors) do not trigger the creation of green pixels around them.\n6.  **Example Walkthrough (train_1):**\n    *   Red pixels `(0, 8)` and `(0, 9)` are adjacent. They belong to the 'paired' red set.\n    *   White pixel `(0, 7)` is adjacent to `(0, 8)`. Since `(0, 8)` is in the 'paired' set, `(0, 7)` becomes green.\n    *   White pixel `(1, 8)` is adjacent to both `(0, 8)` and `(0, 9)`. Both are in the 'paired' set, so `(1, 8)` becomes green.\n    *   Red pixel `(1, 0)` has no adjacent red pixels. It is not in the 'paired' set.\n    *   White pixel `(1, 1)` is adjacent to `(1, 0)`. Since `(1, 0)` is not in the 'paired' set, `(1, 1)` remains white.\n7.  **Example Walkthrough (train_2):**\n    *   Red pixels `(2, 7)` and `(3, 7)` are adjacent. They form the 'paired' red set.\n    *   White pixel `(1, 6)` is adjacent to `(2, 7)`. Since `(2, 7)` is in the 'paired' set, `(1, 6)` becomes green.\n    *   All other red pixels are isolated. White pixels adjacent only to these isolated red pixels remain white.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
