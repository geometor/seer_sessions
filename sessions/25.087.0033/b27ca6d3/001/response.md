"""
Transforms the input grid by applying the following rule:
1. Identify all red pixels (color 2).
2. Determine which red pixels have at least one adjacent red neighbor (including diagonals). Call these 'paired' red pixels.
3. Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4. For every white pixel (color 0) in the input grid, check its 8 neighbors (including diagonals).
5. If any neighbor of a white pixel is a 'paired' red pixel, change that white pixel to green (color 3) in the output grid.
6. Red pixels from the input remain red in the output.
