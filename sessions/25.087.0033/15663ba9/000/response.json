            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** Each input grid contains shapes composed of a single dominant color (azure, green, or blue) on a white background. The shapes have varying complexity, including straight lines, corners, and enclosed areas.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid retains the overall structure and position of the shapes from the input grid. The white background remains unchanged.\n3.  **Color Changes:** Specific pixels of the original shape color are changed to either yellow (4) or red (2) in the output. The original color pixels that are not changed remain the same.\n4.  **Pattern Recognition:** The color changes appear related to the local geometry of the shape at each pixel's location.\n    *   Yellow pixels seem to replace the original color at points that could be described as \"outer\" corners (convex points relative to the shape) or some types of \"inner\" corners (concave points).\n    *   Red pixels seem to replace the original color at specific types of \"inner\" corners, seemingly sharper ones.\n5.  **Neighborhood Analysis:** The transformation rule likely depends on the configuration of neighboring pixels, specifically the count and arrangement of adjacent white pixels (background).\n    *   Pixels changing to yellow (4) consistently have three or more white neighbors (including diagonals).\n    *   Pixels changing to red (2) consistently have exactly two white neighbors, and these two white neighbors are positioned diagonally relative to each other across the pixel in question (e.g., the North and East neighbors are white, or the South and West neighbors are white).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
