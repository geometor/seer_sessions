- task: corner_detection_and_coloring
- description: Identifies different types of corners within shapes based on neighboring background pixels and recolors them.
- objects:
    - type: grid
      properties:
        - contains_pixels
    - type: pixel
      properties:
        - color (value 0-9)
        - position (row, column)
        - neighbors (8 adjacent pixels: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
    - type: shape
      properties:
        - composed_of_contiguous_non_white_pixels
        - has_boundary_pixels_adjacent_to_white_pixels
- relationships:
    - pixel_is_part_of_shape: A non-white pixel belongs to a shape.
    - pixel_is_background: A white pixel (0) is background.
    - pixel_is_neighbor_of_pixel: Based on adjacency (cardinal or diagonal).
- actions:
    - analyze_pixel_neighborhood: For each non-white pixel, count its white neighbors and determine their relative positions.
    - recolor_pixel: Change the color of a pixel based on the neighborhood analysis.
- rules:
    - rule_1:
        - condition: Pixel is non-white AND has exactly 2 white neighbors AND these 2 white neighbors are diagonally adjacent relative to the pixel (e.g., N and E are white, or S and W are white).
        - action: Change pixel color to red (2).
    - rule_2:
        - condition: Pixel is non-white AND has 3 or more white neighbors.
        - action: Change pixel color to yellow (4).
    - rule_3:
        - condition: Pixel is white OR conditions for rule_1 and rule_2 are not met.
        - action: Keep the original pixel color.
