"""
Modify the color of pixels within contiguous blue objects based on their Manhattan distance 
to the nearest non-blue pixel. The new color of a blue pixel is determined by its 
minimum Manhattan distance 'd' to the nearest non-blue pixel. The color follows a 
repeating sequence based on 'd': distance 0 -> color 1 (blue), 
distance 1 -> color 2 (red), distance 2 -> color 3 (green), distance 3 -> color 2 (red). 
This cycle repeats every 4 distance units. Specifically, the color is determined by 
sequence[d % 4], where sequence = [1, 2, 3, 2]. Non-blue pixels remain unchanged.
