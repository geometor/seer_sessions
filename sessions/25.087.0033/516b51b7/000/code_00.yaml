  rule: >
    The new color of a blue pixel is determined by its minimum Manhattan distance 'd'
    to the nearest non-blue (background) pixel. The color follows a repeating sequence
    based on 'd': distance 0 -> color 1 (blue), distance 1 -> color 2 (red),
    distance 2 -> color 3 (green), distance 3 -> color 2 (red).
    This cycle repeats every 4 distance units.
    Specifically, the color is determined by `sequence[d % 4]`, where `sequence = [1, 2, 3, 2]`.
  unchanged: "Non-blue pixels (background) remain unchanged."
