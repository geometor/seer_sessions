The white background pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Color Changes:** Within each blue block, the pixels change color based on their position relative to the boundary of the block. New colors introduced are red (2) and green (3).\n5.  **Pattern:** The color change appears related to the \"depth\" or distance of a pixel from the nearest non-blue (white) pixel outside the block.\n    *   Pixels on the immediate border (distance 0 from the outside) remain blue (1).\n    *   Pixels one step inside (distance 1) become red (2).\n    *   Pixels two steps inside (distance 2) become green (3).\n    *   Pixels three steps inside (distance 3) become red (2) again.\n    *   This suggests a cyclical pattern based on Manhattan distance from the exterior: Blue (1) -> Red (2) -> Green (3) -> Red (2) -> Blue (1) -> ...\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
