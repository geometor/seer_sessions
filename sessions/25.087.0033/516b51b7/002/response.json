            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempted to implement a transformation based on the Manhattan distance of blue pixels (color 1) to the nearest non-blue pixel. The core idea involved calculating this distance (`d`) and using a cyclical color sequence `[1, 2, 3, 2]` based on `d % 4`.\n\nHowever, the comparison between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` reveals significant discrepancies, particularly at the boundaries of the blue shapes. In the `Expected Output`, the blue pixels directly adjacent to non-blue pixels remain blue (color 1), whereas the `Transformed Output` changes them to red (color 2). This indicates an offset or misinterpretation in how the distance maps to the color sequence index.\n\nThe original code calculates the minimum Manhattan distance `min_dist` to the nearest non-blue pixel. For a border blue pixel, this `min_dist` is 1. Applying the sequence index `min_dist % 4` gives `1 % 4 = 1`, resulting in `color_sequence[1] = 2` (red). The expected color is 1 (blue).\n\nA revised hypothesis is that the sequence index should be calculated as `(min_dist - 1) % 4`.\n- For border pixels (`min_dist = 1`), the index becomes `(1 - 1) % 4 = 0`, giving `color_sequence[0] = 1` (blue). This matches the expected output.\n- For the next layer (`min_dist = 2`), the index is `(2 - 1) % 4 = 1`, giving `color_sequence[1] = 2` (red).\n- For `min_dist = 3`, the index is `(3 - 1) % 4 = 2`, giving `color_sequence[2] = 3` (green).\n- For `min_dist = 4`, the index is `(4 - 1) % 4 = 3`, giving `color_sequence[3] = 2` (red).\n- For `min_dist = 5`, the index is `(5 - 1) % 4 = 0`, giving `color_sequence[0] = 1` (blue).\n\nThis revised index calculation `(min_dist - 1) % 4` appears consistent with the patterns observed in the expected outputs across all three examples.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the code to use this revised index calculation while keeping the distance measurement and color sequence the same.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the first example in more detail to confirm the `(min_dist - 1) % 4` hypothesis.\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput Grid (relevant part):\n"
