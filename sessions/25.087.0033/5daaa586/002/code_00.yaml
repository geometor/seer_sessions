task_description: Extracts a rectangular subgrid from the input grid.
observations:
  - The extracted subgrid contains pixels from the original input grid.
  - The boundaries of the subgrid appear to be related to the placement of gray pixels (color 5).
  - In most examples (2 out of 3), the output grid corresponds exactly to the smallest bounding box enclosing all gray pixels in the input grid.
  - Example 1 is an exception to the simple bounding box rule; its output is smaller than the bounding box of all gray pixels.
objects:
  - input_grid: A 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - output_grid: A 2D array of pixels, representing a subgrid of the input.
  - gray_pixels: Pixels with value 5. These seem to act as markers.
properties:
  - gray_pixels_location: The (row, column) coordinates of all gray pixels.
  - gray_pixels_bounding_box: The minimum and maximum row and column indices containing any gray pixel. min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col.
action:
  - Identify all gray pixels (color 5) in the input grid.
  - Determine the minimum row index (min_r), maximum row index (max_r), minimum column index (min_c), and maximum column index (max_c) occupied by any gray pixel.
  - Extract the subgrid from the input grid spanning from row min_r to max_r (inclusive) and from column min_c to max_c (inclusive).
uncertainty:
  - The simple bounding box rule based on all gray pixels does not produce the correct output for Example 1. A more refined rule might involve connected components or identifying line segments, but the current evidence primarily supports the simple bounding box rule for the majority of examples.
