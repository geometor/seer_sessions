A key feature in all inputs is the presence of two distinct, solid vertical lines spanning the full height of the grid and two distinct, solid horizontal lines spanning the full width of the grid. These lines are composed of single, non-white colors. Other non-white pixels might be scattered within the grid.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output is a rectangular subgrid extracted from the input.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying the boundaries defined by the pairs of vertical and horizontal lines and extracting the rectangular region enclosed by these boundaries (inclusive of the boundary lines themselves).\n4.  **Boundary Identification:**\n    *   The left and right boundaries of the output subgrid correspond to the column indices of the two vertical lines found in the input.\n    *   The top and bottom boundaries of the output subgrid correspond to the row indices of the two horizontal lines found in the input.\n5.  **Content Preservation:** The pixel values within the extracted rectangular region are preserved directly from the input to the output. The relative positions of the pixels within the extracted region remain the same.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
