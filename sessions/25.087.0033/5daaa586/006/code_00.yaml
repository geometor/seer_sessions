task_description: Extract a rectangular subgrid from the input grid.
observations:
  - The output grid is always a rectangle.
  - The output grid is generally smaller than the input grid.
  - Gray pixels (color 5) are present in all input examples.
  - Gray pixels are present in all output examples.
  - In some examples (e.g., hypothetical Ex 1), the output contains colors other than gray that were within the gray-defined region in the input.
  - In other examples (e.g., hypothetical Ex 2, Ex 3), the output contains only gray pixels.
extraction_trigger:
  color: gray (5)
  role: Defines the boundaries of the subgrid to be extracted.
bounding_box_definition:
  method: Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR)
  points: All pixels with the trigger color (gray).
  boundaries:
    min_row: Minimum row index of any gray pixel.
    max_row: Maximum row index of any gray pixel.
    min_col: Minimum column index of any gray pixel.
    max_col: Maximum column index of any gray pixel.
output_content: The portion of the original input grid located within the calculated bounding box (inclusive of boundaries).
potential_issues:
  - The previous code implementing this logic failed with index errors, suggesting potential issues with boundary calculations, slicing implementation, or handling of edge cases (e.g., no gray pixels found, gray pixels forming a line). The exact cause of the previous error needs investigation.
