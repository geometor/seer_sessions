However, this code failed on all three training examples with a \"list index out of range\" error. This consistent failure strongly indicates that either:\n1.  The core assumption about extracting the gray pixel bounding box is incorrect for this specific ARC task.\n2.  The code has a bug in handling edge cases, particularly when no gray pixels are present in the input grid, which might be true for one or more examples. The error \"list index out of range\" is somewhat ambiguous in a NumPy context (where `IndexError` is more common), but likely points to accessing an empty array resulting from `np.argwhere` when no gray pixels are found, despite the check `if gray_pixels.size == 0:`.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Re-evaluate the Hypothesis:** The primary strategy must be to abandon or significantly revise the hypothesis that the task involves extracting the bounding box of gray pixels. The transformation rule must be different.\n2.  **Analyze Examples (Requires Data):** The crucial next step is to obtain the actual input-output pairs for the failing examples. Without them, further progress is speculative. Once available, analyze:\n    *   Presence/absence of gray pixels in inputs.\n    *   Relationship between input and output grid dimensions.\n    *   Colors present in input and output.\n    *   Potential patterns, shapes, or objects other than gray pixels that define the transformation. Look for bounding boxes based on *other* colors, shapes, or the extent of *all* non-background pixels.\n    *   Consider transformations beyond simple extraction, such as color replacement, shape completion, or pattern repetition.\n3.  **Refine Code Logic:** If a revised hypothesis still involves bounding boxes or subgrids, ensure the code robustly handles cases where the defining feature (e.g., specific color pixels) is absent, possibly by returning the original grid, an empty grid of specific dimensions, or based on other observed patterns in the examples.\n\n## Metrics Gathering (Placeholder)\n\nAccurate metrics cannot be gathered without access to the specific input/output examples for this task (`00576224`). Executing code now would require guessing the task data.\n\nAssuming access to the data, the following `tool_code` block *would* be used to load the data and gather initial metrics like dimensions and presence of gray pixels:\n\n"
