facts:
  - H1: The input grid contains multiple distinct regions separated by white space.
  - H2: There are typically two main colored regions, one positioned vertically above the other.
  - H3: A horizontal band consisting entirely of white pixels (value 0) separates the upper and lower colored regions. This band spans the full width of the grid.
  - H4: The upper colored region uses one specific non-white color.
  - H5: The lower colored region uses a different specific non-white color.
  - H6: The output grid corresponds exactly to the lower colored region found in the input grid.
  - H7: The dimensions of the output grid match the bounding box of the lower colored region in the input grid.
  - H8: The colors and arrangement of pixels within the output grid are identical to those in the lower colored region of the input grid.
