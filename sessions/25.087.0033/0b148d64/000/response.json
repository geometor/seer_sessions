These white rows act as a clear separator spanning the full width of the grid. The upper region uses one color (e.g., Red in train_1, Azure in train_2, Blue in train_3), and the lower region uses a different color (e.g., Green in train_1, Red in train_2, Yellow in train_3).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid and contains only the pattern and color found in the *lower* region of the corresponding input grid.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying the horizontal separator rows (all white pixels), isolating the region below this separator, and extracting this lower region precisely as the output grid. The upper region and the separator rows are discarded.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

This band spans the full width of the grid.\n  - H4: The upper colored region uses one specific non-white color.\n  - H5: The lower colored region uses a different specific non-white color.\n  - H6: The output grid corresponds exactly to the lower colored region found in the input grid.\n  - H7: The dimensions of the output grid match the bounding box of the lower colored region in the input grid.\n  - H8: The colors and arrangement of pixels within the output grid are identical to those in the lower colored region of the input grid.\n```"
