facts:
  - setup: The input grid is divided into three main regions based on horizontal and vertical separators.
  - region_horizontal: A horizontal band composed entirely of white pixels (0) separates the grid into an Upper Region and a Lower Region.
    - identification: Find the first row index `r_start` where all pixels are white. Find the last consecutive row index `r_end` starting from `r_start` where all pixels are white.
    - upper_region: Consists of all rows above `r_start`.
    - lower_region: Consists of all rows below `r_end`.
  - region_vertical: A vertical band composed entirely of white pixels (0) within the Upper Region acts as a separator.
    - identification: Identify all columns in the Upper Region that consist entirely of white pixels for the full height of the Upper Region.
    - selection: Group consecutive white columns into bands. Select the band with the maximum width. If there is a tie in width, select the leftmost band. Let the columns of this band be `c_start` to `c_end`.
  - subregions: The vertical separator divides the Upper Region into an Upper Left subregion (columns `0` to `c_start - 1`) and an Upper Right subregion (columns `c_end + 1` to `width - 1`).
  - properties:
    - upper_left_count: Number of non-white pixels in the Upper Left subregion.
    - upper_right_count: Number of non-white pixels in the Upper Right subregion.
    - upper_dominant_color: The non-white color that appears most frequently in the entire Upper Region. (Assumes a single dominant color exists).
    - upper_left_width: Width of the Upper Left subregion (`c_start`).
    - upper_right_width: Width of the Upper Right subregion (`width - (c_end + 1)`).
  - action_selection: Determine which set of columns (Left or Right) to use for the output grid based on the Upper Region properties.
    - rule_standard: If the `upper_dominant_color` is NOT Blue (1), select the side (Left or Right) corresponding to the subregion with the strictly higher non-white pixel count (`upper_left_count` vs `upper_right_count`).
    - rule_blue: If the `upper_dominant_color` IS Blue (1), select the side (Left or Right) corresponding to the subregion with the strictly lower non-white pixel count.
    - tie_breaker_count: If the counts are equal, select the side with the larger width (`upper_left_width` vs `upper_right_width`).
    - tie_breaker_width: If the widths are also equal (implying counts were also equal), select the Right side.
  - action_extraction: Create the output grid.
    - rows: Use all rows from the Lower Region.
    - columns: Use the columns corresponding to the selected side (either columns `0` to `c_start - 1` for Left, or columns `c_end + 1` to `width - 1` for Right).
