            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task takes a larger input grid containing multiple scattered shapes and produces a smaller output grid which is a composite image formed by overlaying specific shapes from the input.\n2.  **Background Color:** Each input grid has a dominant color (azure 8, yellow 4, green 3) acting as a background. This background color is largely ignored in the input shapes but is used as the initial fill color for the output grid.\n3.  **Shape Identification:** The core of the task involves identifying specific geometric shapes within the input grid, ignoring the background color. Key shapes observed include:\n    *   'H' shapes (e.g., 5x7 blue in Ex1, 5x7 blue in Ex2, 9x7 blue in Ex3)\n    *   'C' shapes (e.g., 3x3 yellow in Ex1, 3x3 green in Ex2, 3x3 orange in Ex3)\n    *   'L' shapes (e.g., 3x3 magenta corners in Ex2, 3x3 yellow corners in Ex3)\n    *   Other patterns (e.g., 5x5 red 'H' in Ex1, 5x5 red pattern + azure box in Ex3)\n    *   Single Pixels (e.g., white 0 in Ex1, magenta 6 in Ex3)\n4.  **Layering/Composition:** The output grid is constructed by layering these identified shapes according to a consistent template, centered within the output grid dimensions. The layering order observed is generally: Outermost corners ('L' shapes) > Outer frame ('H' shape) > Inner patterns (Red shapes) > Innermost shape ('C' shape).\n5.  **Center Pixel Modification:** If a unique single-pixel object exists in the input, its color replaces the color of the exact center pixel in the final composite output image.\n6.  **Output Grid Size:** The dimensions of the output grid are determined by the bounding box of the shape(s) forming the outermost layer of the composite image (e.g., 7x7 for the blue H in Ex1, 7x7 for the magenta Ls in Ex2, 11x11 for the yellow Ls in Ex3).\n7.  **Color Handling:** Shapes retain their original colors from the input. The initial output grid is filled with the input's background color. Shapes are drawn sequentially onto this grid, overwriting existing colors. The final center pixel might be overwritten again by the single-pixel object's color.\n\n**Facts YAML:**\n\n```"
