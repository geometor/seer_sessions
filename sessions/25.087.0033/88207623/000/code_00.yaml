elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The default color filling most of the grid.
  - object: axis
    color: red (2)
    description: Contiguous vertical lines of red pixels. Act as axes of reflection.
    properties: [vertical, contiguous]
  - object: shape
    color: yellow (4)
    description: Contiguous shapes made of yellow pixels, always adjacent to a red axis.
    properties: [contiguous, adjacent_to_axis]
  - object: source_color_pixel
    color: any color except white(0), red(2), yellow(4) (e.g., gray(5), orange(7), azure(8), green(3))
    description: A single pixel whose color determines the reflection color for a nearby axis/shape structure.
    properties: [isolated initially, spatially associated with an axis/shape structure]
  - object: reflection
    color: determined by source_color_pixel
    description: A new shape created in the output grid by reflecting a yellow shape across a red axis.
    properties: [mirrors_yellow_shape, fills_background_only]

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    subject: shape (yellow)
    object: axis (red)
    description: Yellow shapes are horizontally adjacent to red axes.
  - type: reflection
    subject: shape (yellow)
    across: axis (red)
    result: reflection (colored shape)
    description: Yellow shapes are reflected across the adjacent red axis.
  - type: color determination
    subject: source_color_pixel
    object: reflection
    description: The color of the source_color_pixel determines the color of the reflection associated with the nearby axis/shape structure. The closest source_color_pixel dictates the color.
  - type: spatial association
    subject: source_color_pixel
    object: structure (composed of axis and shape)
    description: Each source_color_pixel is associated with one axis/shape structure, typically based on proximity.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: red axes, yellow shapes, source_color_pixels
  - action: associate
    subject: source_color_pixel
    object: axis/shape structure
    based_on: proximity (closest distance)
  - action: reflect
    target: yellow shape
    across: associated red axis
    color: determined by associated source_color_pixel
  - action: fill
    target: background pixels (white 0)
    location: within the reflected area
    color: reflection color
  - action: preserve
    target: original red axes, yellow shapes, source_color_pixels

constraints:
  - The reflection only fills pixels that were originally white (0). It does not overwrite existing non-white pixels.
  - Each red axis / yellow shape structure pair has one associated source color.
