Neighbors of `(3,10)`: `(2,10)=0`, `(4,10)=0`, `(3,9)=V`, `(3,11)=0`. No.\n          - Let's try from `(2,8)`: `(2,8) -> (2,9)`. Neighbors of `(2,9)`: `(1,9)=0`, `(3,9)=V`, `(2,8)=V`, `(2,10)=0`. No.\n          - How about `(2,11)`? Neighbors: `(1,11)=0`, `(3,11)=0`, `(2,10)=0`, `(2,12)=0`. It seems `(2,11)` is isolated from the main yellow blob connected to the axis.\n          - How about `(1,10)`? Neighbors: `(0,10)=0`, `(2,10)=0`, `(1,9)=0`, `(1,11)=0`. It seems `(1,10)` is also isolated.\n        - **Hypothesis 1:** The code's `find_connected_component` is correct, and the yellow pixels `(1, 10)` and `(2, 11)` are *not* part of the shape connected to the axis `c=6`. Therefore, they should not be reflected. But the expected output *does* show reflections corresponding to these pixels (`(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)`). This suggests the definition of the \"shape\" might be different.\n        - **Hypothesis 2:** Maybe the \"shape\" includes *all* yellow pixels, even disconnected ones, that are on the same side of the axis? No, that seems unlikely and doesn't fit the usual ARC \"object\" concept.\n        - **Hypothesis 3:** Maybe adjacency includes diagonals for finding the connected shape? The code uses 4-connectivity. Let's re-check with 8-connectivity.\n            - `(3,9)` neighbors (diag): `(2,8)=V`, `(2,10)=0`, `(4,8)=V`, `(4,10)=0`.\n            - `(3,10)` neighbors (diag): `(2,9)=V`, `(2,11)=4`, `(4,9)=0`, `(4,11)=0`. Aha! If using 8-connectivity, `(3,10)` connects to `(2,11)`.\n            - `(2,9)` neighbors (diag): `(1,8)=0`, `(1,10)=4`, `(3,8)=V`, `(3,10)=V`. Aha! If using 8-connectivity, `(2,9)` connects to `(1,10)`.\n        - **Revised Hypothesis:** The `find_connected_component` function should use 8-connectivity (including diagonals) instead of 4-connectivity to find the yellow shape. This would include `(1,10)` and `(2,11)` in the shape connected to the `c=6` axis, and their reflections at `(1,2)` and `(2,1)` would be colored gray, matching the `Expected Output`.\n\n**Detailed Analysis - Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** Two red vertical axes (column 6 and column 11). Two yellow shapes. One azure source (8) at (3, 9). One green source (3) at (10, 13).\n*   **Expected Output:** Shows reflection across axis `c=6` using azure (8). Shows reflection across axis `c=11` using green (3).\n*   **Transformed Output:** Shows reflection across axis `c=6` using azure (8). Shows reflection across axis `c=11`, but is missing 4 green pixels compared to expected.\n*   **Difference:** The prompt says `Pixels Off: 4`. Let's verify.\n\n"

Distance 2 (from (10,13) to (10,11) or (11,10) or (12,11)) vs distance 7 for azure. The code seems to have picked the correct color.\n\nThe missing pixels in Example 2 are `(11, 14)`, `(11, 15)`, `(12, 13)`, `(12, 14)`.\nExpected color is green (3). Transformed color is white (0).\n\nLet's trace the reflections again for the pixels in `shape2_pixels_manual`:\nAxis `c=11`. Reflection: `(r, c) -> (r, 22 - c)`.\n- `(9, 10)` -> `(9, 12)`. Input `(9,12)=0`. Expected `(9,12)=3`. Code got `(9,12)=3`. Correct.\n- `(10, 9)` -> `(10, 13)`. Input `(10,13)=3`. Expected `(10,13)=3` (preserved). Code got `(10,13)=3`. Correct. NOTE: The code *only* colors background pixels. This reflection target `(10,13)` is NOT background in the input. However, the expected output *also* has 3 here. This contradicts the \"only color background pixels\" rule derived from Ex1.\n- `(11, 7)` -> `(11, 15)`. Input `(11,15)=0`. Expected `(11,15)=3`. Code got `(11,15)=0`. **Mismatch!**\n- `(11, 8)` -> `(11, 14)`. Input `(11,14)=0`. Expected `(11,14)=3`. Code got `(11,14)=0`. **Mismatch!**\n- `(11, 10)` -> `(11, 12)`. Input `(11,12)=0`. Expected `(11,12)=3`. Code got `(11,12)=3`. Correct.\n- `(12, 8)` -> `(12, 14)`. Input `(12,14)=0`. Expected `(12,14)=3`. Code got `(12,14)=0`. **Mismatch!**\n- `(12, 9)` -> `(12, 13)`. Input `(12,13)=0`. Expected `(12,13)=3`. Code got `(12,13)=0`. **Mismatch!**\n\nThe mismatches are exactly the 4 pixels identified by the diff check.\n\n**Hypothesis Revision:**\n\n1.  **Connectivity:** The yellow shapes need to be found using **8-connectivity (including diagonals)**. This fixes Example 1.\n2.  **Coloring Rule:** The rule \"only color background (white) pixels\" seems incorrect or incomplete. In Example 2, the reflection of `(10, 9)` lands on `(10, 13)`, which is the green source pixel in the input. The expected output keeps this green pixel. The current code also happens to keep it because it copies the input grid initially. However, the reflections that land on white pixels `(11,15)`, `(11,14)`, `(12,14)`, `(12,13)` *are not* colored green by the code, whereas they *are* colored green in the expected output.\n\nLet's reconsider the coloring rule.\n- `output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)` (Preserves original non-white)\n- `if input_grid[r_reflected, c_reflected] == 0:` (Only update background)\n  `output_grid[r_reflected, c_reflected] = reflection_color`\n\nThis logic means:\n- If reflected target is non-white in input -> Keep original color.\n- If reflected target is white in input -> Change to reflection color.\n\nThis explains why `(10, 13)` stays green. But it fails for `(11, 15)`, `(11, 14)`, `(12, 14)`, `(12, 13)` which are white in input but don't get colored green in the transformed output.\n\nWhy would the code fail to color these white pixels?\nThe code structure is:\n"

If the `current_shape_pixels` include `(11, 7)`, `(11, 8)`, `(12, 8)`, `(12, 9)`, and the reflection calculation is correct, and the target pixels are indeed white (0) in the input, then the `output_grid` *should* be updated.\n\nCould the `find_connected_component` be the issue again?\nThe code uses BFS. In Example 2, the adjacent seeds to axis `c=11` are `(9,10)` and `(11,10)`.\nLet's assume the BFS starts from `(9,10)`. The code execution showed it finds: `[(9, 10), (10, 9), (11, 7), (11, 8), (11, 10), (12, 8), (12, 9)]` using 8-connectivity. This list *does* include the necessary pixels `(11, 7)`, `(11, 8)`, `(12, 8)`, `(12, 9)`.\n\nIs there something subtle happening with the loops or visited sets?\nThe code iterates through `red_pixels`. Finds an axis. Marks axis pixels visited. Finds adjacent yellow *seeds*. Iterates through seeds. If seed not `processed_yellow_pixels`, find full component, mark component pixels processed. Calculate reflection.\nIn Example 2, axis `c=11` has adjacent yellow seeds `(9,10)` and `(11,10)`.\n- Process seed `(9,10)`:\n    - Find component (using 8-conn): `[(9, 10), (10, 9), (11, 7), (11, 8), (11, 10), (12, 8), (12, 9)]`.\n    - Mark all these as `processed_yellow_pixels`.\n    - Determine side: `(9,10)` is left of `c=11`. Shape side is 'left'.\n    - Find closest source: Green (3).\n    - Reflect:\n        - `(9, 10)` -> `(9, 12)`. `Input(9,12)=0`. `Output(9,12)=3`.\n        - `(10, 9)` -> `(10, 13)`. `Input(10,13)=3`. `Output(10,13)` unchanged (remains 3).\n        - `(11, 7)` -> `(11, 15)`. `Input(11,15)=0`. `Output(11,15)=3`.\n        - `(11, 8)` -> `(11, 14)`. `Input(11,14)=0`. `Output(11,14)=3`.\n        - `(11, 10)` -> `(11, 12)`. `Input(11,12)=0`. `Output(11,12)=3`.\n        - `(12, 8)` -> `(12, 14)`. `Input(12,14)=0`. `Output(12,14)=3`.\n        - `(12, 9)` -> `(12, 13)`. `Input(12,13)=0`. `Output(12,13)=3`.\n- Next seed `(11,10)`: Check if `(11,10)` is in `processed_yellow_pixels`. Yes. Skip.\n\nThis trace suggests that if 8-connectivity is used for `find_connected_component`, and the coloring logic is `if input_grid[r_reflected, c_reflected] == 0: output_grid[r_reflected, c_reflected] = reflection_color`, the output *should* match the expected output for Example 2 as well.\n\n**Conclusion:** The primary error seems to be the use of 4-connectivity instead of 8-connectivity in `find_connected_component`. The secondary potential issue regarding the coloring rule seems resolved by careful tracing - the existing rule combined with 8-connectivity appears to work for both examples.\n\nLet's refine the facts and NL program.\n\n---\n## Assessment and Strategy\n\n**Assessment:**\nThe provided code fails on two training examples.\n- Example 1 fails because the yellow shape connected to the axis was incompletely identified. Specifically, pixels connected diagonally were missed. The code output is missing 2 reflected pixels.\n- Example 2 fails for the same reason. The yellow shape connected to the second axis was incompletely identified due to missing diagonal connections. The code output is missing 4 reflected pixels.\n- The logic for finding the axis, determining the closest source color based on Manhattan distance to the combined axis-shape structure, and performing the reflection calculation seems correct.\n- The rule of only coloring pixels that were originally background (white) also appears consistent with the expected outputs when the full shape (including diagonals) is considered.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Modify the `find_connected_component` function to use 8-way connectivity (including diagonals) instead of 4-way connectivity.\n2.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and NL program) to explicitly state that yellow shapes are identified using 8-connectivity.\n\n---\n## Metrics\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input Grid Size: 16x16\n- Output Grid Size: 16x16\n- Colors: White(0), Blue(1 - Not used), Red(2), Green(3 - Not used), Yellow(4), Gray(5), Magenta(6 - Not used), Orange(7), Azure(8 - Not used), Maroon(9 - Not used).\n- Red Axes: Vertical line at c=6 (rows 1-6), Vertical line at c=5 (rows 11-14).\n- Yellow Shapes:\n    - Shape 1 (adjacent to axis c=6): Uses 8-connectivity.

Otherwise, leave the pixel in the output grid unchanged (it retains its value copied from the input).\n5.  **Final Output**: Return the modified output grid.\n\nThis revised program incorporates the 8-connectivity requirement for identifying shapes, which should resolve the issues observed in the examples.Okay, I have analyzed the discrepancies between the code's output and the expected output for the provided examples. The core issue seems to lie in how connected yellow shapes are identified.\n\n## General Assessment and Strategy\n\n*   **Assessment:** The code currently uses 4-way connectivity (up, down, left, right) to find connected yellow shapes adjacent to red axes. Both failed examples (Example 1 and Example 2) show discrepancies where the expected output includes reflections of yellow pixels that are only diagonally connected to the main body of the yellow shape adjacent to the axis. The rest of the logic (axis finding, source finding, distance calculation, reflection mechanism, and coloring only background pixels) appears consistent with the expected outputs once the full shape is considered.\n*   **Strategy:** The primary change required is to modify the shape identification component (`find_connected_component` function) to use 8-way connectivity (including diagonals) when searching for connected yellow pixels. This should correctly identify the full extent of the shapes intended for reflection.\n\n## Metrics\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid: 16x16\n*   Axis 1: c=6, Source Color: Gray (5) (Closest distance: 2)\n*   Shape 1: Adjacent to Axis 1 (right side). Using 8-connectivity, includes pixels like (1,10) and (2,11).\n*   Axis 2: c=5, Source Color: Orange (7) (Closest distance: 4)\n*   Shape 2: Adjacent to Axis 2 (left side). Uses 8-connectivity.\n*   Code Failure: Using 4-connectivity, the code missed yellow pixels (1,10) and (2,11) in Shape 1.\n*   Resulting Error: The reflections of these pixels, which should be gray (5) at (1,2) and (2,1) respectively (on background pixels), were missing in the transformed output.\n*   Pixels Off: 2\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid: 14x16\n*   Axis 1: c=6, Source Color: Azure (8)\n*   Shape 1: Adjacent to Axis 1 (left side). Uses 8-connectivity.\n*   Axis 2: c=11, Source Color: Green (3) (Closest distance: 2)\n*   Shape 2: Adjacent to Axis 2 (left side). Uses 8-connectivity, includes pixels like (11,7), (11,8), (12,8), (12,9).\n*   Code Failure: Using 4-connectivity, the code missed yellow pixels (11,7), (11,8), (12,8), (12,9) in Shape 2 because they are only connected diagonally to the part adjacent to the axis via (11,10) or (10,9).\n*   Resulting Error: The reflections of these pixels, which should be green (3) at (11,15), (11,14), (12,14), (12,13) respectively (on background pixels), were missing in the transformed output.\n*   Pixels Off: 4\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
