"""
The transformation rule identifies vertical red lines (axes) and adjacent yellow shapes in the input grid. 
For each red axis and its associated yellow shape, it finds the single, non-background, non-red, non-yellow pixel (source color pixel) that is closest to the combined axis/shape structure. 
It then reflects the yellow shape across the red axis. The reflected pixels are colored with the color of the closest source pixel. 
This reflection only changes pixels that were originally white (background) in the input grid. 
All original non-white pixels are preserved in the output.

**General Assessment:**

The provided code attempted to implement a reflection transformation based on red axes and adjacent yellow shapes. However, the results show significant discrepancies between the transformed output and the expected output for both examples. The primary issue seems to be an incomplete understanding of how the yellow shapes are identified and reflected. The code currently only considers yellow pixels *directly adjacent* to the red axis, whereas the expected output suggests that the *entire connected yellow shape* adjacent to the axis should be reflected. The calculation of the source color appears to be mostly correct in principle (closest non-axis, non-shape color), but it needs to be applied based on the distance to the *entire structure* (axis + full connected yellow shape). The strategy will be to refine the object identification step (specifically for the yellow shapes) and ensure the reflection process applies to the complete identified shape.

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 16x16, 10 red pixels, 25 yellow pixels, 2 source pixels (gray, orange).
    *   Output Mismatch: 16 pixels off.
    *   Expected Reflections: 23 pixels. Transformed Reflections: 7 pixels.
    *   `missed_reflection_pixels`: 16 pixels that should have been colored (9 gray, 7 orange) but remained background (0).
    *   `extra_reflection_pixels`: None. The code did not create any incorrectly colored pixels, it just failed to color enough pixels.
    *   This confirms the hypothesis: the code only reflects *some* pixels (likely the directly adjacent ones) instead of the *entire* shape.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 14x16, 10 red pixels, 20 yellow pixels, 2 source pixels (azure, green).
    *   Output Mismatch: 10 pixels off.
    *   Expected Reflections: 18 pixels. Transformed Reflections: 8 pixels.
    *   `missed_reflection_pixels`: 10 pixels that should have been colored (6 azure, 4 green) but remained background (0).
    *   `extra_reflection_pixels`: None.
    *   Again, this confirms the code is not reflecting the complete yellow shapes.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Reflect shapes across axes, coloring the reflection based on the nearest source pixel.

definitions:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9.
  - object: axis
    description: A contiguous vertical line of red (2) pixels.
  - object: shape
    description: A contiguous group of yellow (4) pixels.
  - object: source_pixel
    description: A single pixel whose color is not background (0), red (2), or yellow (4).
  - object: structure
    description: The union of pixels forming an axis and a specific adjacent shape.

interactions:
  - action: find_axes
    input: grid
    output: list of axis objects (pixel coordinates)
  - action: find_shapes_adjacent_to_axis
    input: grid, axis
    output: list of shape objects (pixel coordinates)
    condition: The shape must contain at least one pixel horizontally adjacent to a pixel in the axis.
    algorithm_hint: Use connected components (flood fill or similar) starting from yellow pixels adjacent to the axis.
  - action: find_closest_source
    input: grid, structure (axis + shape)
    output: color of the source_pixel
    condition: The source_pixel must be the one with the minimum Manhattan distance to *any* pixel within the structure. Ties are broken implicitly (or need further clarification if examples show otherwise).
  - action: reflect_shape
    input: shape, axis
    output: set of reflected pixel coordinates
    details: For each pixel (r, c_yellow) in the shape, and its adjacent axis pixel column c_axis, the reflected coordinate is (r, c_axis + (c_axis - c_yellow)).
  - action: color_reflection
    input: grid, reflected_coordinates, source_color
    output: modified grid
    condition: Only change pixels in the grid at the reflected_coordinates if the original color at that coordinate is background (0). The new color is the source_color.

workflow:
  - step: Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid.
  - step: Identify all distinct vertical axes (red lines).
  - step: For each axis:
    - Identify all full, distinct, connected yellow shapes adjacent to this axis.
    - For each adjacent yellow shape:
      - Define the structure as the union of the axis pixels and the shape pixels.
      - Find the closest source_pixel color to this structure.
      - If a source_color is found:
        - Calculate the reflected coordinates for all pixels in the shape across the axis.
        - For each reflected coordinate (r_ref, c_ref):
          - If (r_ref, c_ref) is within grid bounds AND input_grid[r_ref, c_ref] is background (0):
            - Set output_grid[r_ref, c_ref] = source_color.
  - step: Return output_grid.

constraints:
  - Reflection only colors background pixels; existing non-background pixels are preserved.
  - Axes are strictly vertical.
  - A shape is associated with an axis if it touches it horizontally.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct vertical red lines (color 2), treating each contiguous vertical segment as a single axis.
3.  For each identified red axis:
    a.  Find all yellow pixels (color 4) that are horizontally adjacent (left or right) to any pixel of the current axis.
    b.  For each such adjacent yellow pixel, perform a connected components search (like flood fill) using only yellow pixels to identify the complete connected yellow shape it belongs to. Collect all unique shapes found this way that are adjacent to the current axis.
    c.  For each unique connected yellow shape identified in step 3b:
        i.  Determine the set of all pixels belonging to the current red axis and the current yellow shape (this is the 'structure').
        ii. Identify all 'source' pixels in the input grid (pixels that are not background (0), red (2), or yellow (4)).
        iii. Calculate the Manhattan distance from each source pixel to every pixel in the 'structure'. Find the source pixel with the minimum distance to *any* pixel in the structure. If there are no source pixels, skip to the next shape. Let the color of this closest source pixel be the `reflection_color`. (Note: Assumes the first encountered minimum distance source pixel breaks ties).
        iv. For every yellow pixel `(r, c_yellow)` belonging to the current shape:
            1.  Determine the column `c_axis` of the red axis (it's constant for a vertical axis).
            2.  Calculate the reflected column coordinate: `c_reflected = c_axis + (c_axis - c_yellow)`. The row coordinate `r_reflected` remains the same (`r`).
            3.  Check if the reflected coordinate `(r_reflected, c_reflected)` is within the grid boundaries.
            4.  If it is within bounds AND the pixel at `(r_reflected, c_reflected)` in the *original input grid* is background (color 0), then set the color of the pixel at `(r_reflected, c_reflected)` in the *output grid* to the `reflection_color` found in step 3(c)iii.
4.  Return the final output grid.
