"""
Identifies the largest solid rectangle composed of a single non-white color in the input grid. 
This rectangle is considered the 'frame'. The function then extracts the content 
(the subgrid) located strictly inside this frame, excluding the frame pixels themselves.
The extracted subgrid is returned as the output.
