"""
Identifies a rectangular frame defined by the bounding box of a single non-white color 
whose pixels exclusively occupy the perimeter of that bounding box within the grid. 
It then extracts the content (subgrid) located strictly inside this frame, excluding 
the frame pixels themselves. If multiple such frames exist, the one enclosing the 
largest area is chosen. If no such frame is found, or if the frame is too thin 
(less than 3x3) to contain any content, an empty grid is returned.

Note: This logic successfully explains Examples 1 and 2 of task 'aec13089', but 
it predicts an incorrect output for Example 3. The extraction rule might need 
further refinement to handle all cases.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The provided Python code attempts to solve the ARC task by identifying a rectangular frame of a single color and extracting the content within it. The code failed on all three training examples, consistently producing a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`.

This error typically occurs in Python when a NumPy array containing multiple boolean values is used in a context expecting a single boolean (e.g., an `if` statement or boolean operators like `and`, `or`, `not`).

Looking at the `_is_perimeter_correct` function, the conditions like `if not (0 <= r1 < height and 0 <= c < width and grid[r1, c] == color):` combine multiple scalar boolean results using standard Python `and`. While this looks correct syntactically for scalar inputs, there might be an edge case or interaction with NumPy types causing ambiguity, or perhaps an unexpected result from the indexing `grid[r1, c]`.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Fix the `ValueError`**: Modify the `_is_perimeter_correct` function to use explicit NumPy array operations (like slicing and `np.all()`) to check perimeter segments. This avoids iterating pixel by pixel with potentially ambiguous conditional logic and is generally more efficient.
2.  **Re-evaluate Logic**: Once the code runs, re-assess its correctness against all examples. The previous notes indicated a potential logic flaw concerning Example 3, which might persist even after fixing the `ValueError`. The rule for identifying the "correct" frame or the extraction method might need refinement based on Example 3's specific pattern.

## Metrics

Based on the execution results provided:

| Example   | Input Shape (Assumed) | Output Shape (Expected) | Status    | Error Type    | Error Location Guess       | Notes                                    |
| :-------- | :-------------------- | :---------------------- | :-------- | :------------ | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| Example 1 | Variable              | Variable                | **Error** | `ValueError`  | `_is_perimeter_correct`? | Failed during frame validation process.  |
| Example 2 | Variable              | Variable                | **Error** | `ValueError`  | `_is_perimeter_correct`? | Failed during frame validation process.  |
| Example 3 | Variable              | Variable                | **Error** | `ValueError`  | `_is_perimeter_correct`? | Failed during frame validation process.  |
|           |                       |                         |           |               |                            | *Logic might be incorrect even if runs.* |

*Note: Input/Output shapes are variable as they depend on the specific ARC task data, which was not provided.*

The consistent `ValueError` across all examples strongly suggests the error lies within the common logic applied to all inputs, specifically the frame validation part (`_is_perimeter_correct` or its usage).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Potential Frame Colors**: Find all unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Bounding Boxes**: For each potential frame color identified:
    a. Find all pixel coordinates where this color appears.
    b. If pixels of this color exist, calculate the minimum bounding box (min row, min col, max row, max col) enclosing all these pixels.
3.  **Validate Frames**: For each color and its calculated bounding box:
    a. **Perimeter Check**: Verify that *all* pixels along the *entire* perimeter of the bounding box within the grid match the frame color. Use array slicing and `np.all()` for robust checking of top row, bottom row, left column (excluding corners), and right column (excluding corners).
    b. **Interior Check**: Verify that *no* pixels of the frame color exist strictly *inside* the bounding box (i.e., not on the perimeter).
    c. If both checks pass, consider this color and bounding box a "valid frame".
4.  **Select Largest Frame**: If multiple valid frames are found, select the one whose bounding box encloses the largest area (calculated as `height * width` of the bounding box). If no valid frames are found, proceed to step 6.
5.  **Extract Content**: If a valid frame was selected:
    a. Check if the frame's bounding box dimensions are at least 3x3 (i.e., `max_row > min_row + 1` AND `max_col > min_col + 1`).
    b. If the frame is large enough, extract the subgrid corresponding to the region strictly *inside* the frame (from `min_row + 1` to `max_row - 1` and `min_col + 1` to `max_col - 1`). This is the output grid.
    c. If the frame is too small (less than 3x3), the output grid is empty.
6.  **Final Output**: Return the extracted content subgrid (as a list of lists) or an empty list if no suitable frame was found or the selected frame contained no content.

*Self-Correction Note:* The original `_is_perimeter_correct` implementation likely failed due to using standard Python boolean logic (`and`/`or`/`not`) on intermediate NumPy boolean results without explicit aggregation (`.any()`/`.all()`). The revised program emphasizes using NumPy's vectorized operations (`np.all`) for the perimeter check to resolve this `ValueError`. The potential logic issue identified with Example 3 needs to be re-evaluated after this fix.
