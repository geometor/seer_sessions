Task: Extract content from within the largest valid frame.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D array of pixels (integers 0-9).
  - Objects:
    - Potential_Frames: Contiguous pixels of a single non-white color (potential candidates).
    - Content: Pixels located inside a frame.
    - Background: Pixels with value 0 (white).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D array of pixels, representing the extracted content. Can be empty.

Transformation_Properties:
  - Frame_Definition: A rectangle defined by the bounding box of a single non-white color.
  - Frame_Validation_Criteria:
    1. All pixels on the 1-pixel thick perimeter of the bounding box within the input grid must be of the frame's color.
    2. All pixels of the frame's color within the input grid must lie *only* on that specific perimeter. (No pixels of the frame color inside or outside this perimeter rectangle).
  - Frame_Selection: If multiple valid frames (potentially of different colors) exist, select the one whose bounding box encloses the largest area (height * width). If ties occur, the selection criteria among tied frames is currently implicit (likely based on color iteration order).
  - Content_Extraction: The output grid consists of the pixels located strictly inside the selected frame's perimeter (i.e., input_grid[min_row+1 : max_row, min_col+1 : max_col]).
  - Edge_Cases:
    - No_Valid_Frame: If no color forms a valid frame according to the criteria, the output is an empty grid.
    - No_Content: If the selected valid frame has a height or width less than 3, it cannot contain any content. The output is an empty grid.

Implicit_Assumptions:
  - Frames are exactly 1 pixel thick.
  - Frames are solid (no gaps in the perimeter).
  - Frame color is uniform.
  - Only one frame color is considered at a time for validation.
