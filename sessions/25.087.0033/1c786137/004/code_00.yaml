Objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D Array (List of Lists)
    properties:
      - pixels: Cells with integer values 0-9 (colors).
      - shape: height and width (1-30).
  - name: frame
    type: Conceptual Rectangle
    properties:
      - color: A single non-white color (1-9).
      - location: Defined by a bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
      - pixels: Must occupy *only* the perimeter of the bounding box within the input_grid.
        - Condition 1: All pixels on the bounding box perimeter must be of the frame color.
        - Condition 2: All pixels of the frame color must lie on the bounding box perimeter (no pixels of this color inside).
      - size: Must be at least 3x3 to contain content.
  - name: content
    type: 2D Array (Subgrid)
    properties:
      - pixels: Pixels from the input_grid located strictly inside the frame boundary.
      - location: Defined by (min_row+1, min_col+1) to (max_row-1, max_col-1) relative to the frame's bounding box.
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D Array (List of Lists)
    properties:
      - Represents the extracted 'content'.
      - Is empty ([]) if no valid frame with content is found.

Actions:
  - action: identify_potential_frames
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: List of potential frame colors and their bounding boxes.
    description: Finds all unique non-white colors. For each color, determines the minimum bounding box containing all pixels of that color.
  - action: validate_frame
    inputs: input_grid, color, bounding_box
    outputs: Boolean (is_valid_frame)
    description: Checks if the pixels of the specified 'color' perfectly form *only* the perimeter of the 'bounding_box'. Uses conditions 1 and 2 defined under 'frame' properties.
  - action: select_largest_frame
    inputs: List of valid frames (color, bounding_box)
    outputs: The single frame enclosing the largest area (or None).
    description: Calculates area based on bounding box dimensions and selects the maximum.
  - action: extract_content
    inputs: input_grid, selected_frame_bounding_box
    outputs: content (subgrid)
    description: Extracts the subgrid within the inner boundaries (min_row+1:max_row, min_col+1:max_col) of the frame's bounding box. Handles cases where the frame is too small (less than 3x3) by returning an empty grid.
  - action: generate_output
    inputs: content (subgrid)
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Converts the extracted content (numpy array) back to a list of lists format. Returns an empty list if content is empty or no valid frame was found.
