Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   Each input grid contains various colored pixels arranged in a 2D grid.
*   Each output grid is smaller than its corresponding input grid.
*   In each input grid, there is a distinct rectangular frame made of a single, non-white color (yellow in example 1, red in example 2, gray in example 3).
*   The content inside this rectangular frame appears to directly correspond to the output grid.
*   The frame itself is not included in the output.
*   The colors and relative positions of the pixels *within* the frame are preserved in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Extract the content from inside a rectangular frame found in the input grid.
elements:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - object: frame
    description: A solid rectangle composed of a single non-white color that encloses a region of other pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (yellow, red, gray in examples), but is uniform for a single frame.
      - shape: Rectangle.
      - location: Bounding box defined by (min_row, min_col) and (max_row, max_col).
      - characteristic: Appears to be the largest such rectangle enclosing a distinct area in the input.
  - object: content
    description: The subgrid of pixels located strictly inside the frame.
    relationship: Enclosed by the frame.
transformation:
  action: Identify
    target: frame
    details: Locate the largest solid rectangle made of a single non-white color.
  action: Extract
    target: content
    details: Select the subgrid starting one pixel inside the frame's top-left corner and ending one pixel before the frame's bottom-right corner.
output:
  result: The extracted content subgrid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all solid rectangular blocks in the input grid where each block is composed of a single, uniform, non-white color.
2.  Determine the rectangular block among these that has the largest area (width * height). This is the 'frame'. In case of ties in area, additional criteria might be needed, but based on the examples, the largest area seems sufficient.
3.  Let the coordinates of the top-left corner of the frame be (min_row, min_col) and the bottom-right corner be (max_row, max_col).
4.  Extract the subgrid from the input starting at row `min_row + 1` and column `min_col + 1`, and ending at row `max_row - 1` and column `max_col - 1`.
5.  This extracted subgrid is the final output.
