In case of ties in area, additional criteria might be needed, but based on the examples, the largest area seems sufficient.\n3.  Let the coordinates of the top-left corner of the frame be (min_row, min_col) and the bottom-right corner be (max_row, max_col).\n4.  Extract the subgrid from the input starting at row `min_row + 1` and column `min_col + 1`, and ending at row `max_row - 1` and column `max_col - 1`.\n5.  This extracted subgrid is the final output."
