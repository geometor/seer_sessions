Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: list index out of range

## Example 2:
Error: list index out of range

## Example 3:
Error: list index out of range
Okay, let's analyze the situation. The previous code attempted to solve the task by finding the largest solid non-white rectangle and extracting its inner content. This approach failed on all training examples with a "list index out of range" error.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

1.  **Error Analysis:** The "list index out of range" error suggests the code is trying to access invalid indices in a list. Given the code structure, this likely occurs either during the conversion of the input list-of-lists to a NumPy array (if the input is jagged) or during the extraction slice `grid[min_r + 1 : max_r, min_c + 1 : max_c]` if the calculated coordinates (`min_r`, `min_c`, `max_r`, `max_c`) are somehow incorrect or lead to an invalid state, despite the checks. The check `max_r > min_r + 1 and max_c > min_c + 1` correctly returns `[]` for thin frames, so the error must be happening *before* that return, possibly within the slicing operation itself under certain edge conditions, or if the initial assumption about the input `input_grid` being a perfect rectangle is violated.
2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** The core hypothesis (find a frame, extract content) might be correct, but the specifics (largest frame, solid frame, non-white frame) or the implementation details are likely flawed. We need to re-examine all examples to find the common pattern. The error across all examples indicates a fundamental mismatch between the implemented logic and the task requirements.
3.  **Strategy:**
    *   Use `tool_code` to gather precise metrics (shapes, unique colors, potentially bounding box coordinates based on the failed logic) for all training examples.
    *   Visually inspect the input/output pairs (assuming access to the visual representation or the raw grid data) to identify the actual frame and content relationship.
    *   Formulate a new, more accurate natural language description based on the evidence from *all* examples.
    *   Update the YAML facts.

**Gathering Metrics:**

To understand the structure of the inputs and outputs where the code failed, let's retrieve their dimensions and unique colors.

**Analysis of Metrics and Examples:**

1.  **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 8x8, Output: 4x4
    *   Input Colors: white(0), blue(1), green(3), gray(5)
    *   Output Colors: green(3), gray(5)
    *   The previous code identified the 2x2 green(3) rectangle as the largest solid rectangle (`frame_coords=(3, 3, 4, 4)`). This is clearly *not* the intended frame.
    *   The *actual* frame appears to be the blue(1) rectangle from (1, 1) to (6, 6). The content inside this frame is the 5x5 subgrid `inp[2:6, 2:6]`.
    *   However, the output is 4x4. Comparing `inp[2:6, 2:6]` with the output `out1`, the output matches the *inner* 4x4 part of this content, specifically `inp[2:6, 2:6]`. This means the frame is the blue(1) border, and the content *inside* the frame is extracted. The frame itself is 1 pixel thick.
    *   Frame: Blue(1), Coordinates: (1, 1) to (6, 6). Content Slice: `inp[1+1 : 6, 1+1 : 6]` -> `inp[2:6, 2:6]`. Output: `[[5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 3, 3, 5], [5, 3, 3, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5]]`. This matches the output `out1`.

2.  **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5, Output: 3x3
    *   Input Colors: white(0), red(2), azure(8)
    *   Output Colors: white(0), azure(8)
    *   The previous code identified the single azure(8) pixel as the largest solid rectangle. Again, incorrect.
    *   The actual frame seems to be the red(2) rectangle from (0, 0) to (4, 4).
    *   Content Slice: `inp[0+1 : 4, 0+1 : 4]` -> `inp[1:4, 1:4]`. Output: `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`. This matches the output `out2`.

3.  **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 5x6, Output: 2x2
    *   Input Colors: white(0), yellow(4)
    *   Output Colors: white(0), yellow(4)
    *   The previous code failed to find *any* solid rectangle because the yellow shape is hollow.
    *   The frame appears to be the yellow(4) hollow rectangle defined by corners (1, 1) and (3, 4).
    *   Content Slice: `inp[1+1 : 3, 1+1 : 4]` -> `inp[2:3, 2:4]`. Output: `[[0, 0]]`. This does *not* match the output `out3` which is `[[0, 0], [4, 4]]`.

**Revisiting Example 3:**

Let's look at `in3` again:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],
 [0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0],
 [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Output `out3`:

```
[[0, 0],
 [4, 4]]
```

The yellow frame is at rows 1-3, cols 1-4. The inner part is `inp[2:3, 2:4]`, which is `[[0, 0]]`. The actual output is `[[0, 0], [4, 4]]`. This doesn't fit the simple "extract content inside frame" pattern.

What if the frame isn't the rectangle bounding the non-white color, but specifically a rectangle *border*?

*   Ex1: Blue border at (1,1) to (6,6). Content inside: `inp[2:6, 2:6]`. Matches output.
*   Ex2: Red border at (0,0) to (4,4). Content inside: `inp[1:4, 1:4]`. Matches output.
*   Ex3: Yellow border (hollow rect) from (1,1) to (3,4). Content inside: `inp[2:3, 2:4]` is `[[0,0]]`. Output is `[[0,0],[4,4]]`. Mismatch.

**Alternative Hypothesis for Example 3:** Maybe the task isn't about extracting content *inside* a frame, but removing the frame?

*   Ex1: Remove blue(1) border -> Leaves the 5x5 inner part + surrounding white(0). Not the output.
*   Ex2: Remove red(2) border -> Leaves the 3x3 inner part + surrounding white(0). Not the output.

**Let's reconsider the definition of the "frame".**

Perhaps the frame is defined as the single-pixel-thick outermost border *of the entire grid* if that border consists of a single non-white color.

*   Ex1: Outermost border (row 0, row 7, col 0, col 7) is white(0). Not applicable.
*   Ex2: Outermost border (row 0, row 4, col 0, col 4) is red(2). Yes. Content inside: `inp[1:4, 1:4]`. Matches output.
*   Ex3: Outermost border (row 0, row 4, col 0, col 5) is white(0). Not applicable.

This works for Example 2 but not 1 or 3.

**New Hypothesis:** Find the largest rectangular border (not necessarily solid, can be hollow) composed of a single non-white color. Extract the content strictly inside this border.

*   **Ex1:** Input 8x8. Blue(1) forms a border from (1,1) to (6,6). Size 6x6. Content inside is `inp[2:6, 2:6]`. Shape 4x4. Matches output.
*   **Ex2:** Input 5x5. Red(2) forms a border from (0,0) to (4,4). Size 5x5. Content inside is `inp[1:4, 1:4]`. Shape 3x3. Matches output.
*   **Ex3:** Input 5x6. Yellow(4) forms a hollow border from (1,1) to (3,4). Size 3x4. Content inside is `inp[2:3, 2:4]`. Shape 1x2. Output is 2x2. **Mismatch persists.**

**What is special about Example 3's output?** `[[0, 0], [4, 4]]`. Where does this 2x2 grid come from?
Input `in3`:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],  <- Row 1
 [0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0],  <- Row 2
 [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],  <- Row 3
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

The "inside" is `inp[2:3, 2:4]` which is `[[0, 0]]`. The output seems related to the structure *within* the frame, but not a simple extraction. The output `[[0, 0], [4, 4]]` looks like columns 2 and 3 from rows 2 and 3? No, that would be `[[0, 0], [4, 4]]`. Okay, it matches exactly `inp[2:4, 2:4]`.
So, for Example 3, the frame is (1,1) to (3,4). The content extraction seems to be `inp[frame_min_r+1 : frame_max_r, frame_min_c+1 : frame_max_c]`. This gives `inp[2:3, 2:4]`, which is `[[0, 0]]`. Still not matching `[[0, 0], [4, 4]]`.

Is the output `inp[2:4, 2:4]`? Let's check:
Row 2, Col 2-3: `[0, 0]`
Row 3, Col 2-3: `[4, 4]`
Combined: `[[0, 0], [4, 4]]`. Yes!

So, the rule seems to be:
1.  Identify the rectangular frame (possibly hollow). This frame is defined by the smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of a single non-white color that forms the border.
2.  Let the frame coordinates be (min_r, min_c) to (max_r, max_c).
3.  The output is the subgrid extracted using `input[min_r + 1 : max_r, min_c + 1 : max_c]`.

Let's re-test this rule:
*   **Ex1:** Frame Blue(1) at (1,1) to (6,6). Output = `inp[1+1 : 6, 1+1 : 6]` = `inp[2:6, 2:6]`. Matches `out1`. Size (6-2)x(6-2) = 4x4. Correct.
*   **Ex2:** Frame Red(2) at (0,0) to (4,4). Output = `inp[0+1 : 4, 0+1 : 4]` = `inp[1:4, 1:4]`. Matches `out2`. Size (4-1)x(4-1) = 3x3. Correct.
*   **Ex3:** Frame Yellow(4) at (1,1) to (3,4). Output = `inp[1+1 : 3, 1+1 : 4]` = `inp[2:3, 2:4]`. Size (3-2)x(4-2) = 1x2. Calculated output is `[[0, 0]]`. Actual output `out3` is `[[0, 0], [4, 4]]`. **RULE STILL FAILS on Example 3.**

**Final Attempt Hypothesis:** The frame is identified as before (outermost rectangle of a single non-white color). The content *inside* this frame is extracted. The previous code implementation had an error, or the understanding of "inside" was wrong. The slice `min_r+1 : max_r` excludes the pixel at `max_r`. The slice `min_c+1 : max_c` excludes the pixel at `max_c`. This seems correct for "strictly inside".

Why did the code fail with "list index out of range"? Looking at the metrics, the code *incorrectly* identified frames in Ex1 and Ex2, and found *no* frame in Ex3.
*   Ex1: Identified 2x2 green rect at (3,3) to (4,4). `min_r=3, max_r=4, min_c=3, max_c=4`. Check `max_r > min_r+1` -> `4 > 3+1` is False. Check `max_c > min_c+1` -> `4 > 3+1` is False. The code should have returned `[]`.
*   Ex2: Identified 1x1 azure rect at (2,2) to (2,2). `min_r=2, max_r=2, min_c=2, max_c=2`. Checks `2 > 2+1` and `2 > 2+1` are False. Should return `[]`.
*   Ex3: Found no solid rectangle. Should return `[]`.

In all cases, the previous code *should have returned `[]` based on its own logic*, because the identified "frames" were too small or non-existent. The fact it produced an index error suggests either:
a) The error occurred *before* the size check (unlikely, slicing happens after).
b) The error is in the test harness running the code.
c) The `np.array(input_grid)` conversion failed due to jagged input (unlikely for standard ARC tasks).
d) There's a subtle bug in the numpy slicing or `tolist()` under specific conditions triggered by these inputs, possibly related to how `np.where` results are used when the found region is small.

Let's stick with the most consistent hypothesis derived from visual inspection:
1. Find the non-white color C that forms the outermost rectangular border.
2. Determine the bounding box (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c) of all pixels with color C.
3. Verify that all pixels on the perimeter of this bounding box within the grid are either color C or outside the grid boundary (this allows for frames touching the edge). *Correction*: A simpler check might be sufficient: Find the bounding box of a non-white color. Check if this box's perimeter pixels *within the grid* are all of that color. Select the color/box that satisfies this and encloses the largest area.
4. Extract the content strictly inside this bounding box: `grid[min_r+1 : max_r, min_c+1 : max_c]`.

Applying this refined hypothesis:
*   **Ex1:** Blue(1) frame (1,1) to (6,6). Perimeter check passes. Output `grid[2:6, 2:6]`. Matches.
*   **Ex2:** Red(2) frame (0,0) to (4,4). Perimeter check passes. Output `grid[1:4, 1:4]`. Matches.
*   **Ex3:** Yellow(4) frame (1,1) to (3,4). Perimeter check passes (it's hollow, but all yellow pixels lie on the perimeter). Output `grid[2:3, 2:4]`. This is `[[0, 0]]`. STILL DOES NOT MATCH `[[0, 0], [4, 4]]`.

There must be something fundamentally different about Example 3. The frame is 3x4. The output is 2x2. The simple extraction rule `grid[min_r+1:max_r, min_c+1:max_c]` gives a 1x2 output. The actual output corresponds to `grid[min_r+1 : max_r+1, min_c+1 : max_c]`. Why `max_r+1`?? That would include the bottom border row.

Let's try `grid[min_r+1 : max_r+1, min_c+1 : max_c+1]`?
*   Ex1: Frame (1,1) to (6,6). Slice `[2:7, 2:7]`. Size 5x5. No, output is 4x4.
Let's try `grid[min_r+1 : max_r, min_c+1 : max_c]`? (Original hypothesis slice)
*   Ex1: Frame (1,1) to (6,6). Slice `[2:6, 2:6]`. Size 4x4. Yes.
*   Ex2: Frame (0,0) to (4,4). Slice `[1:4, 1:4]`. Size 3x3. Yes.
*   Ex3: Frame (1,1) to (3,4). Slice `[2:3, 2:4]`. Size 1x2. No, output is 2x2.

Maybe the definition of the frame in Ex3 is different? What if the frame is just the outer boundary *touching* the background (white)?
In Ex3, the yellow pixels form a shape. The bounding box is (1,1) to (3,4).
The background is white(0).
Maybe the task is: Find the single non-white color object. Find its bounding box. Extract the content inside.
But what *is* the content in Ex3? The output `[[0,0],[4,4]]` seems to be `grid[2:4, 2:4]`.
Why these coordinates? Frame is `(min_r=1, min_c=1)` to `(max_r=3, max_c=4)`.
Slice is `[min_r+1 : max_r+1, min_c+1 : max_c+1 - 1]` ??? -> `[2:4, 2:4]`. This seems ad-hoc.

What if we look at the center of the frame?
Ex1: Frame 6x6. Center area. Output 4x4.
Ex2: Frame 5x5. Center area. Output 3x3.
Ex3: Frame 3x4. Center area? Output 2x2.
It looks like we identify the rectangular frame (bounding box of the single non-white color forming the border) and extract the content, removing a 1-pixel border on all sides.

Let `(min_r, min_c)` and `(max_r, max_c)` be the frame coordinates.
The extracted grid is `grid[min_r+1 : max_r, min_c+1 : max_c]`.
Let's re-calculate dimensions:
*   Ex1: Frame (1,1) to (6,6). Output `grid[2:6, 2:6]`. Size is `(6-2) x (6-2) = 4x4`. Matches output shape.
*   Ex2: Frame (0,0) to (4,4). Output `grid[1:4, 1:4]`. Size is `(4-1) x (4-1) = 3x3`. Matches output shape.
*   Ex3: Frame (1,1) to (3,4). Output `grid[2:3, 2:4]`. Size is `(3-2) x (4-2) = 1x2`. **DOES NOT MATCH OUTPUT SHAPE (2x2)**.

I am consistently failing to explain Example 3 with the same rule as Examples 1 and 2. This suggests either Example 3 follows a different rule variation, or my understanding of the frame/extraction is incorrect.

Could the frame *always* be square?
Ex1: Blue frame is 6x6 (square). Extract inside -> 4x4. OK.
Ex2: Red frame is 5x5 (square). Extract inside -> 3x3. OK.
Ex3: Yellow frame is 3x4 (NOT square). Bounding box (1,1) to (3,4). What if the task involves making the extraction area square? Or centered? The output is 2x2. The 'inside' region defined by the simple slice is 1x2.

Let's assume the rule is "Extract `grid[min_r+1:max_r, min_c+1:max_c]`". This works for Ex1 and Ex2. It yields `[[0, 0]]` for Ex3. The actual output for Ex3 is `[[0, 0], [4, 4]]`. The *only* difference is the inclusion of the row at `max_r` (row 3) in the slice. Why? Does it depend on the frame shape? Frame 3x4. Output 2x2. Original slice was 1x2.

Maybe the slice is `grid[min_r+1 : min_r+1+output_height, min_c+1 : min_c+1+output_width]` where output dimensions depend on frame dimensions `H = max_r-min_r+1`, `W = max_c-min_c+1`?
Output dims seem to be `(H-2) x (W-2)`.
Ex1: Frame 6x6 -> Output (6-2)x(6-2) = 4x4. Slice `grid[1+1 : 1+1+4, 1+1 : 1+1+4]` = `grid[2:6, 2:6]`. Correct.
Ex2: Frame 5x5 -> Output (5-2)x(5-2) = 3x3. Slice `grid[0+1 : 0+1+3, 0+1 : 0+1+3]` = `grid[1:4, 1:4]`. Correct.
Ex3: Frame 3x4 -> Output (3-2)x(4-2) = 1x2. Slice `grid[1+1 : 1+1+1, 1+1 : 1+1+2]` = `grid[2:3, 2:4]`. Correct according to this rule, but *still doesn't match the actual output `[[0, 0], [4, 4]]`*.

I must accept that my analysis of Example 3 is flawed or incomplete based on the available data. However, the pattern for Ex1 and Ex2 seems robust: find the single-color rectangular frame, extract the content inside removing a 1-pixel border. The previous code failed likely because its frame-finding logic ("largest solid non-white rectangle") was incorrect. It should look for the rectangle defined by the bounding box of the border color.

Let's proceed with the hypothesis that covers Ex1 and Ex2, and acknowledge the discrepancy in Ex3. The simplest rule covering Ex1/Ex2 is finding the bounding box of the frame color and slicing `[min_r+1:max_r, min_c+1:max_c]`.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Extract the content located strictly inside a rectangular frame.

definitions:
  grid: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors (0-9).
  background_color: white (0).
  frame_color: A single non-white color C that forms a rectangular border.
  frame_object: The set of all pixels with the frame_color C.
  frame_bounding_box: The minimal bounding box enclosing all pixels of the frame_object. Coordinates (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c).
  content_object: The subgrid located strictly inside the frame_bounding_box.

actions:
  1. identify_potential_frame_colors: Find all unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
  2. for_each potential_frame_color C:
     a. find_pixels: Locate all pixels with color C.
     b. calculate_bounding_box: Determine the minimum bounding box (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c) enclosing these pixels.
     c. verify_frame_perimeter: Check if all pixels on the perimeter of the bounding box (within the grid dimensions) have color C.
     d. if verified: This color C defines the frame. Store its bounding box. Assume only one such frame exists per grid. *Correction: Select the frame that encloses the largest area if multiple candidates exist, or perhaps the outermost one.* Let's assume the unique outermost frame for now.
  3. if frame_bounding_box found:
     a. calculate_content_coordinates: Content starts at (min_r + 1, min_c + 1) and ends at (max_r - 1, max_c - 1).
     b. extract_content: Slice the input grid using these coordinates: `input_grid[min_r + 1 : max_r, min_c + 1 : max_c]`.
     c. handle_empty_content: If `max_r <= min_r + 1` or `max_c <= min_c + 1`, the content is empty. Return an empty grid.
  4. else (no frame found): Return an empty grid. # Or handle based on specific task rules if no frame is found.

    output_matches: No # Actual output is [[0, 0], [4, 4]]
    discrepancy: Rule predicts 1x2 output, actual is 2x2. The rule fails to account for this example.

uncertainties:
  - The exact rule for identifying the frame when multiple candidates exist (e.g., nested frames). Current assumption: outermost single-color rectangular border.
  - The correct extraction logic for Example 3. The standard "remove 1-pixel border" rule does not produce the observed output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
2.  For each non-white color `C`:
    a.  Find all pixels that have color `C`.
    b.  Determine the minimum bounding box (`min_r`, `min_c`, `max_r`, `max_c`) enclosing all pixels of color `C`.
    c.  Check if this bounding box represents the frame: Verify that all grid cells located on the perimeter of this bounding box (i.e., at row `min_r`, row `max_r`, column `min_c`, or column `max_c`, between the box's boundaries) have the color `C`.
    d.  If the perimeter check is successful, consider this bounding box as a candidate frame.
3.  Select the correct frame from the candidates. (Rule unclear - assume the one enclosing the largest area, or the unique one if only one exists). If no candidate frame is found, return an empty grid.
4.  If a frame (`min_r`, `min_c`, `max_r`, `max_c`) is selected:
    a.  Check if the frame can contain content (i.e., if `max_r > min_r + 1` AND `max_c > min_c + 1`).
    b.  If it can contain content, extract the subgrid located strictly inside the frame by slicing the input grid: `output = input_grid[min_r + 1 : max_r, min_c + 1 : max_c]`.
    c.  If it cannot contain content (frame is too thin), return an empty grid.
5.  Return the extracted `output` grid.

**(Note:** This program accurately describes the transformation for the first two examples but fails for the third. Further refinement is needed to reconcile Example 3.)
