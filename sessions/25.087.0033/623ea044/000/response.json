It contains multiple pixels of the same non-white color found in the input, arranged in a distinct pattern originating from the position of the input pixel. The background remains white.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The non-white pixels in the output form an 'X' shape. This 'X' is centered at the original coordinates of the non-white pixel from the input grid. The arms of the 'X' extend diagonally outwards in all four directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) until they reach the boundary of the grid. The central pixel itself is part of the 'X'.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
