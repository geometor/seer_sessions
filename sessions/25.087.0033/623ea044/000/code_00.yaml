task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
    - background_color: The background is consistently white (0).
  input_elements:
    - type: single_pixel
      color: non-white (variable, e.g., orange, red, azure)
      count: 1
      location: variable (r, c)
  output_elements:
    - type: pattern
      shape: diagonal_cross ('X')
      color: same as the single non-white input pixel
      origin: centered at the location (r, c) of the input pixel
      extent: extends from the origin to the grid boundaries along all four diagonals.
  transformation:
    - type: pattern_generation
    - description: Draws an 'X' pattern using the input pixel's color, centered at the input pixel's location, extending to the grid edges.
