Identify all white pixels (color 0) that form contiguous areas connected to the border of the grid. This connection is defined by 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right) through other white pixels. These are considered 'background' white pixels.\n2. All other white pixels, which are not connected to the border via a path of white pixels, are considered 'enclosed' white pixels.\n3. Identify all gray pixels (color 5) in the input grid.\n4. For each gray pixel, check its 8 neighbors (including diagonals).\n5. If any neighbor of a gray pixel is an 'enclosed' white pixel (identified in step 2), change the color of that gray pixel to red (color 2) in the output grid.\n6. All pixels that are not gray pixels identified in step 5 retain their original color from the input grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_reachable_background(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a flood fill (BFS) starting from the white pixels (0) on the\n    border of the grid to identify all white pixels connected to the outside.\n    Uses 4-directional neighbors for checking connectivity within the white area.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: A boolean mask where True indicates a white pixel reachable\n                  from the border.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    reachable = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    q = deque()\n\n    # Seed the queue with all white pixels (0) on the border\n    for r in range(height):\n        if grid[r, 0] == 0 and not reachable[r, 0]:\n            q.append((r, 0))\n            reachable[r, 0] = True\n        # Check the right border, avoid double-adding corners if width=1\n        if width > 1 and grid[r, width - 1] == 0 and not reachable[r, width - 1]:\n            q.append((r, width - 1))\n            reachable[r, width - 1] = True\n    for c in range(1, width - 1): # Avoid corners already checked\n        if grid[0, c] == 0 and not reachable[0, c]:\n            q.append((0, c))\n            reachable[0, c] = True\n        # Check the bottom border, avoid double-adding corners if height=1\n        if height > 1 and grid[height - 1, c] == 0 and not reachable[height - 1, c]:\n            q.append((height - 1, c))\n            reachable[height - 1, c] = True\n\n    # Perform BFS using 4-directional neighbors\n    while q:\n        r, c = q.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            # Check bounds and if the neighbor is white and not yet visited\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and \\\n               grid[nr, nc] == 0 and not reachable[nr, nc]:\n                reachable[nr, nc] = True\n                q.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return reachable\n\ndef get_neighbors_8way(r, c, height, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gets the coordinates of all valid 8-connected neighbors for a given cell (r, c).\n\n    Args:\n        r (int): Row index of the cell.\n        c (int): Column index of the cell.\n        height (int): Grid height.\n        width (int): Grid width.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of tuples, where each tuple is the (row, col) of a neighbor.\n    \"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            # Skip the cell itself\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            # Check if the neighbor coordinates are within the grid bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                neighbors.append((nr, nc))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Convert input list of lists to a NumPy array for efficient processing\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n    \n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid\n    output_np = input_np.copy()\n\n    # Step 1: Identify background white pixels (connected to the border)\n    # Use flood fill (BFS) starting from border white pixels.\n    background_white_mask = find_reachable_background(input_np)\n\n    # Prepare a mask to quickly check if a pixel is an enclosed white pixel\n    # Step 2: Identify enclosed white pixels\n    enclosed_white_mask = np.zeros_like(input_np, dtype=bool)\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if input_np[r, c] == 0 and not background_white_mask[r, c]:\n                enclosed_white_mask[r, c] = True\n\n    # Step 3-5: Iterate through the grid, find gray pixels, check neighbors, and modify output\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check if the current pixel is gray (color 5)\n            if input_np[r, c] == 5:\n                # Get its 8 neighbors\n                neighbors = get_neighbors_8way(r, c, height, width)\n                # Check if any neighbor is an enclosed white pixel\n                should_turn_red = False\n                for nr, nc in neighbors:\n                    if enclosed_white_mask[nr, nc]:\n                        should_turn_red = True\n                        break # Found one enclosed white neighbor, no need to check others\n                \n                # If a neighbor was an enclosed white pixel, change this gray pixel to red in the output\n                if should_turn_red:\n                    output_np[r, c] = 2 # Change color to red\n\n    # Step 6: Convert the final output NumPy array back to a list of lists\n    output_grid = output_np.tolist()\n    \n    return output_grid\n```"
