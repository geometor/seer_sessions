These squares remain static; they do not change position or color between input and output.\n    *   **Colored Pixels:** There are several individual pixels of various colors (non-white, non-gray). These are the pixels that undergo transformation.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves changing the position of some colored pixels and removing others. The gray squares seem to influence this transformation.\n5.  **Interaction:**\n    *   Colored pixels that start adjacent (including diagonally) to any part of a gray 2x2 square disappear (are turned white) in the output.\n    *   Colored pixels that are *not* adjacent to a gray square move to a new position. Their destination appears to be a location adjacent to the \"closest\" gray square.\n6.  **Movement Rule:**\n    *   \"Closest\" gray square is determined using Manhattan distance from the colored pixel to the nearest cell of the 2x2 gray square.\n    *   Ties in distance are broken by choosing the gray square whose top-left corner has the highest row index, then the highest column index.\n    *   The destination cell is the empty cell adjacent to the chosen gray square that requires the shortest Manhattan distance path from the original colored pixel's location.\n    *   Ties for the destination cell are broken by choosing the cell with the lowest row index, then the lowest column index.\n    *   The original location of the moved pixel becomes white.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
