Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 2D grids of colored pixels.
2.  **Background:** The white pixels (color 0) act as the background and remain unchanged in all examples.
3.  **Key Objects:**
    *   **Gray Squares:** There are always one or more 2x2 squares composed entirely of gray pixels (color 5). These squares remain static; they do not change position or color between input and output.
    *   **Colored Pixels:** There are several individual pixels of various colors (non-white, non-gray). These are the pixels that undergo transformation.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves changing the position of some colored pixels and removing others. The gray squares seem to influence this transformation.
5.  **Interaction:**
    *   Colored pixels that start adjacent (including diagonally) to any part of a gray 2x2 square disappear (are turned white) in the output.
    *   Colored pixels that are *not* adjacent to a gray square move to a new position. Their destination appears to be a location adjacent to the "closest" gray square.
6.  **Movement Rule:**
    *   "Closest" gray square is determined using Manhattan distance from the colored pixel to the nearest cell of the 2x2 gray square.
    *   Ties in distance are broken by choosing the gray square whose top-left corner has the highest row index, then the highest column index.
    *   The destination cell is the empty cell adjacent to the chosen gray square that requires the shortest Manhattan distance path from the original colored pixel's location.
    *   Ties for the destination cell are broken by choosing the cell with the lowest row index, then the lowest column index.
    *   The original location of the moved pixel becomes white.
