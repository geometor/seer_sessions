            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code implements a flood fill algorithm starting from red pixels (2), spreading through white pixels (0), and theoretically blocked by azure pixels (8). However, the results show that the transformation failed on all training examples. The transformed outputs consistently contain far more red pixels than the expected outputs, filling almost all non-azure areas. This indicates that the flood fill constraint logic is incorrect or incomplete.\n\nThe core issue seems to be that the flood fill is spreading beyond the intended boundaries. While the code correctly identifies azure pixels as non-fillable, it doesn't seem to correctly interpret them as \"walls\" that contain the fill within specific regions. The expected outputs suggest the red fill should be confined to the contiguous area(s) of non-azure pixels that contain the initial red seed pixel(s). The current implementation allows the fill to propagate to any adjacent white pixel, effectively ignoring the compartmentalization implied by the azure structures.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Identify Regions:** Before performing the flood fill, identify all contiguous regions composed of non-azure pixels. This can be done using a connectivity analysis (like another flood fill or connected components labeling) on all non-azure pixels.\n2.  **Locate Seed Region(s):** Determine which of these identified regions contain the initial red seed pixel(s).\n3.  **Constrained Flood Fill:** Perform the flood fill as before (starting from red seeds, filling adjacent white pixels with red), but add a crucial constraint: only fill a white pixel if it belongs to the same pre-identified region(s) as the seed pixel(s).\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n"
