**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid based on the interaction between specific colored pixels.

1.  **Input Grid:** Contains predominantly white pixels (0), structures made of azure pixels (8), and one or more red pixels (2).
2.  **Azure Pixels (8):** These form structures, often lines or segments, which appear to act as boundaries or walls within the grid. They remain unchanged in the output.
3.  **Red Pixels (2):** These seem to be the starting points or "seeds" for the transformation. Their initial positions are crucial.
4.  **White Pixels (0):** These represent empty space that can potentially be filled.
5.  **Output Grid:** The original azure structures and red pixels remain. Some white pixels adjacent to the initial red pixels (and subsequently adjacent to newly filled pixels) are changed to red. This change propagates outwards but is constrained.
6.  **Transformation:** The core operation appears to be a "flood fill" or "region filling" process. The red color spreads from the initial red pixel(s) into connected white areas. The spread is stopped by azure pixels and the grid boundaries.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0), red (2), azure (8)
      - position: (row, column)
  - object: azure_structure
    description: Contiguous or non-contiguous sets of azure pixels (8).
    properties:
      - acts_as: boundary or wall
      - state: static (does not change between input and output)
  - object: red_seed
    description: One or more red pixels (2) in the input grid.
    properties:
      - acts_as: starting point for fill
      - state: persistent (remains red in the output)
  - object: fill_area
    description: Connected region of white pixels (0) in the input grid.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally or vertically.
  - type: connectivity
    description: White pixels are connected if they are adjacent. A region of white pixels is connected if there is a path of adjacent white pixels between any two pixels in the region.
  - type: containment
    description: The fill_area is often contained within boundaries formed by azure_structures and/or grid edges.
  - type: initiation
    description: The red_seed initiates the filling process within the connected fill_area it occupies or is adjacent to.
actions:
  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: red_seed(s), azure_structure(s), fill_area(s)
  - action: flood_fill
    actor: system
    origin: red_seed(s)
    target: connected white pixels (0) adjacent to the origin or already filled pixels
    color: red (2)
    constraints: Stop filling at azure pixels (8) and grid boundaries.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the location(s) of all red pixels (color 2) in the input grid. These are the starting points for the fill.
2.  Identify all azure pixels (color 8). These act as barriers.
3.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4.  Perform a flood fill operation starting from the identified red pixel locations:
    *   Maintain a list or queue of pixels to visit, initially containing the starting red pixel locations.
    *   While the list is not empty:
        *   Take a pixel location (r, c) from the list.
        *   For each of its cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right):
            *   Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.
            *   Check if the neighbor pixel in the *output* grid is currently white (color 0).
            *   If both conditions are true:
                *   Change the neighbor pixel's color to red (2) in the output grid.
                *   Add the neighbor's location to the list of pixels to visit.
5.  The process stops naturally when no more adjacent white pixels can be reached from the filled red areas without crossing an azure pixel or a grid boundary.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
