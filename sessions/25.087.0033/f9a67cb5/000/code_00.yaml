elements:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0), red (2), azure (8)
      - position: (row, column)
  - object: azure_structure
    description: Contiguous or non-contiguous sets of azure pixels (8).
    properties:
      - acts_as: boundary or wall
      - state: static (does not change between input and output)
  - object: red_seed
    description: One or more red pixels (2) in the input grid.
    properties:
      - acts_as: starting point for fill
      - state: persistent (remains red in the output)
  - object: fill_area
    description: Connected region of white pixels (0) in the input grid.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally or vertically.
  - type: connectivity
    description: White pixels are connected if they are adjacent. A region of white pixels is connected if there is a path of adjacent white pixels between any two pixels in the region.
  - type: containment
    description: The fill_area is often contained within boundaries formed by azure_structures and/or grid edges.
  - type: initiation
    description: The red_seed initiates the filling process within the connected fill_area it occupies or is adjacent to.
actions:
  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: red_seed(s), azure_structure(s), fill_area(s)
  - action: flood_fill
    actor: system
    origin: red_seed(s)
    target: connected white pixels (0) adjacent to the origin or already filled pixels
    color: red (2)
    constraints: Stop filling at azure pixels (8) and grid boundaries.
