They remain unchanged in the output.\n3.  **Red Pixels (2):** These seem to be the starting points or \"seeds\" for the transformation. Their initial positions are crucial.\n4.  **White Pixels (0):** These represent empty space that can potentially be filled.\n5.  **Output Grid:** The original azure structures and red pixels remain. Some white pixels adjacent to the initial red pixels (and subsequently adjacent to newly filled pixels) are changed to red. This change propagates outwards but is constrained.\n6.  **Transformation:** The core operation appears to be a \"flood fill\" or \"region filling\" process. The red color spreads from the initial red pixel(s) into connected white areas. The spread is stopped by azure pixels and the grid boundaries.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all azure pixels (color 8). These act as barriers.\n3.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n4.  Perform a flood fill operation starting from the identified red pixel locations:\n    *   Maintain a list or queue of pixels to visit, initially containing the starting red pixel locations.\n    *   While the list is not empty:\n        *   Take a pixel location (r, c) from the list.\n        *   For each of its cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right):\n            *   Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.\n            *   Check if the neighbor pixel in the *output* grid is currently white (color 0).\n            *   If both conditions are true:\n                *   Change the neighbor pixel's color to red (2) in the output grid.\n                *   Add the neighbor's location to the list of pixels to visit.\n5.  The process stops naturally when no more adjacent white pixels can be reached from the filled red areas without crossing an azure pixel or a grid boundary.\n6.  Return the modified output grid."
