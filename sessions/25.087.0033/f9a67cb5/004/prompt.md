"""
Performs a flood fill operation starting from all initial red pixels (color 2).
The fill color is red (2).
The fill spreads to adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels (color 0).
The fill is blocked by azure pixels (color 8) and the grid boundaries.
A 'visited' set is used to keep track of processed pixels to prevent infinite loops and redundant work.
Only white pixels reachable from an initial red pixel without crossing an azure pixel are changed to red.
The original red and azure pixels remain in their positions in the output grid.
