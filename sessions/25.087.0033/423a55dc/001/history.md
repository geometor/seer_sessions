*   **Perception**:
    *   Each input grid contains a single contiguous object composed of a non-white color (red, magenta, green, or azure). The rest of the grid is white.
    *   The object's shape varies across examples (letters 'G', 'C', rectangles, hollow rectangles).
    *   The output grid contains the same object (identical shape and color) as the input, but positioned differently.
    *   The object in the output grid is always shifted towards the top-left corner (0,0).
    *   The shift magnitude seems to be determined by the object's initial position, moving it until its top-most part hits the top edge (row 0) and its left-most part hits the left edge (column 0).

*   **YAML Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task: object_translation
    elements:
      - type: grid
        role: input
        properties:
          - contains a single contiguous non-white object
          - background is white (0)
      - type: object
        role: subject
        properties:
          - color: varies (red, magenta, green, azure)
          - shape: varies
          - position: varies within the input grid
      - type: grid
        role: output
        properties:
          - same dimensions as input
          - contains the translated object
          - background is white (0)
    actions:
      - name: find_object
        input: input_grid
        output: object_pixels (list of coordinates and color)
      - name: calculate_bounding_box
        input: object_pixels
        output: top_left_corner (min_row, min_col)
      - name: calculate_translation_vector
        input: top_left_corner
        output: vector (-min_row, -min_col)
      - name: translate_object
        input: object_pixels, vector
        output: translated_object_pixels
      - name: render_output
        input: grid_dimensions, translated_object_pixels
        output: output_grid
    relationships:
      - The object in the output grid has the same shape and color as the object in the input grid.
      - The position of the object in the output grid is determined by translating the input object such that its top-leftmost pixel moves to coordinate (0, 0).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    2.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid that form a single contiguous object. Record their coordinates (row, column) and color.
    3.  Find the minimum row index (`min_row`) and the minimum column index (`min_col`) among the coordinates of the object's pixels.
    4.  For each pixel of the object identified in step 2, located at input coordinates (`r`, `c`) with a specific color:
        a.  Calculate the corresponding output coordinates by subtracting the minimum row and column: `new_r = r - min_row`, `new_c = c - min_col`.
        b.  Set the pixel at (`new_r`, `new_c`) in the output grid to the object's color.
    5.  Return the completed output grid.
