task_description: Translate a single non-white object horizontally based on its position relative to the side edges, keeping its vertical position unchanged.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
object_properties:
  - type: Single contiguous block of non-background pixels.
  - identification: Find all pixels with color value > 0.
  - features:
      - bounding_box: Defined by min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col.
      - horizontal_gap_before: min_col
      - horizontal_gap_after: grid_width - 1 - max_col
transformation:
  - type: Translation
  - vertical_shift: 0 (no change in row position)
  - horizontal_shift_rule:
      - condition: horizontal_gap_before <= horizontal_gap_after
      - action: shift_left_amount = min_col (moves object to left edge)
      - condition: horizontal_gap_before > horizontal_gap_after
      - action: shift_left_amount = floor((horizontal_gap_before + 1) / 2)
  - pixel_mapping: Each object pixel at (r, c) in the input moves to (r, c - shift_left_amount) in the output.
output_grid:
  - initialization: Create a grid of the same size as input, filled with the background color.
  - population: Place the translated object pixels onto the initialized grid.
