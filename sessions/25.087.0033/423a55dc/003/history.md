Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding of the task.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code attempted to translate the single non-white object so its top-left corner aligned with the grid's top-left corner (0, 0). The results clearly show this is incorrect. The transformed outputs from the code consistently place the object starting at row 0 and column 0, while the expected outputs show that the object retains its original vertical position but undergoes a specific horizontal shift.

The key failure was the assumption about the target location. Instead of moving to (0, 0), the object only shifts horizontally. The amount of horizontal shift appears to depend on the object's initial horizontal position relative to the grid boundaries.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Identify Object and Bounding Box:** Keep the logic to find all non-white pixels and determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices (`min_row`, `min_col`, `max_row`, `max_col`).
2.  **Calculate Horizontal Gaps:** Determine the empty space to the left (`gap_before = min_col`) and right (`gap_after = grid_width - 1 - max_col`) of the object's bounding box.
3.  **Determine Horizontal Shift (dx):**
    *   If `gap_before` is less than or equal to `gap_after`, the object should be shifted to the left edge. The required shift is `dx = -min_col`.
    *   If `gap_before` is greater than `gap_after`, the object should be shifted leftwards, but not necessarily to the edge. The required shift appears to be `dx = -floor((gap_before + 1) / 2)`.
4.  **Determine Vertical Shift (dy):** The vertical position remains unchanged, so the vertical shift `dy` is 0.
5.  **Apply Transformation:** Create a new grid of the same dimensions, filled with the background color (white, 0). For each original object pixel at `(r, c)`, place its color at the new coordinates `(r + dy, c + dx)`, which simplifies to `(r, c + dx)`, in the output grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not the background color. These pixels constitute a single contiguous object.
3.  Determine the bounding box of this object by finding its minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, and maximum column indices.
4.  Calculate the horizontal gap before the object (`gap_before`), which is equal to the minimum column index.
5.  Calculate the horizontal gap after the object (`gap_after`), which is the grid width minus 1 minus the maximum column index.
6.  Determine the horizontal shift amount (`shift_left_amount`):
    a.  If `gap_before` is less than or equal to `gap_after`, set `shift_left_amount` equal to `gap_before`.
    b.  If `gap_before` is greater than `gap_after`, set `shift_left_amount` equal to the floor of `(gap_before + 1) / 2`.
7.  For each non-background pixel found in step 2, located at `(row, column)` in the input grid:
    a.  Calculate its new column index: `new_column = column - shift_left_amount`.
    b.  The row index remains unchanged: `new_row = row`.
    c.  Set the pixel at `(new_row, new_column)` in the output grid to the color of the original pixel.
8.  Return the completed output grid.
