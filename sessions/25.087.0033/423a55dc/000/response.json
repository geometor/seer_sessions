The rest of the grid is white.\n    *   The object's shape varies across examples (letters 'G', 'C', rectangles, hollow rectangles).\n    *   The output grid contains the same object (identical shape and color) as the input, but positioned differently.\n    *   The object in the output grid is always shifted towards the top-left corner (0,0).\n    *   The shift magnitude seems to be determined by the object's initial position, moving it until its top-most part hits the top edge (row 0) and its left-most part hits the left edge (column 0).\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
