            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code attempted to implement a transformation based on identifying blue objects, their bounding boxes, and centers. The core logic involved changing Azure pixels to Magenta based on three conditions: being on the center row, being on the center column, or being strictly inside the bounding box of any blue object.\n\nThe results show mismatches in both provided examples. The transformed outputs contain more Magenta pixels than the expected outputs. Specifically, Azure pixels that lie *within* the bounding box of a blue object but *not* on its center row or center column were incorrectly changed to Magenta.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the transformation rule by removing the condition related to pixels being strictly inside the bounding box. The revised rule should only change Azure pixels to Magenta if they lie on the same row as the center row of a blue object OR on the same column as the center column of a blue object.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's analyze the properties of the blue objects and the locations of the errors.\n\n*   **Colors:** Blue (1), Azure (8), Magenta (6)\n*   **Background:** Azure (8)\n*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of Blue (1) pixels. These appear to be hollow rectangles.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Blue Object 1:** Pixels form a 5x5 hollow square.\n    *   Rows: 3 to 7\n    *   Cols: 3 to 7\n    *   Bounding Box: (min_row=3, max_row=7, min_col=3, max_col=7)\n    *   Center: (row=(3+7)//2=5, col=(3+7)//2=5)\n*   **Blue Object 2:** Pixels form a 5x5 hollow square.\n    *   Rows: 9 to 13\n    *   Cols: 8 to 12\n    *   Bounding Box: (min_row=9, max_row=13, min_col=8, max_col=12)\n    *   Center: (row=(9+13)//2=11, col=(8+12)//2=10)\n\n*   **Errors in Example 1 (Transformed vs. Expected):** The pixels that are Magenta in the transformed output but Azure in the expected output are:\n    *   (4, 4), (4, 6) - Inside BB1, not on center axes.\n    *   (6, 4), (6, 6) - Inside BB1, not on center axes.\n    *   (10, 9), (10, 11) - Inside BB2, not on center axes.\n    *   (12, 9), (12, 11) - Inside BB2, not on center axes.\n    *   Total: 8 pixels.\n\n*   **Confirmation:** These errors correspond exactly to the Azure pixels that fall *strictly within* the bounding boxes calculated but are not on the center row (5 or 11) or center column (5 or 10).\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Blue Object 1:** Pixels form a 5x5 hollow square.\n    *   Rows: 1 to 5\n    *   Cols: 3 to 7\n    *   Bounding Box: (min_row=1, max_row=5, min_col=3, max_col=7)\n    *   Center: (row=(1+5)//2=3, col=(3+7)//2=5)\n\n*   **Errors in Example 2 (Transformed vs. Expected):** The pixels that are Magenta in the transformed output but Azure in the expected output are:\n    *   (2, 4), (2, 6) - Inside BB1, not on center axes.\n    *   (4, 4), (4, 6) - Inside BB1, not on center axes.\n    *   Total: 4 pixels.\n\n*   **Confirmation:** These errors correspond exactly to the Azure pixels that fall *strictly within* the bounding box calculated but are not on the center row (3) or center column (5).\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"
