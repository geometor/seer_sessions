task_description: >
  The task involves identifying blue objects (typically hollow rectangles) within an azure grid. 
  Based on the center coordinates derived from the bounding box of each blue object, specific azure pixels are recolored to magenta.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: azure (8)
  - object_color: blue (1)
  - target_color: magenta (6)

objects:
  - type: contiguous block of pixels
    color: blue (1)
    shape: often hollow rectangles, but potentially other contiguous shapes
    properties:
      - bounding_box: (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col)
      - center: (center_row, center_col) calculated as the integer division floor of the average of the bounding box min/max row and column.

actions:
  - description: >
      Recolor specific azure pixels to magenta.
  - criteria: >
      An azure pixel at (r, c) is changed to magenta if its row 'r' matches the center_row of *any* identified blue object, 
      OR if its column 'c' matches the center_col of *any* identified blue object.
  - preservation: >
      All original blue pixels remain blue. Azure pixels not meeting the criteria remain azure. All other colored pixels (if any) remain unchanged.
