elements:
  - role: background
    color: Azure (8)
    pixels: Most pixels in the input grid.
  - role: input_object
    color: Blue (1)
    count: One or more per input grid.
    shape: Hollow squares/rectangles (specifically 5x5 hollow squares in examples).
    properties:
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing the object.
      - center_row: The middle row index of the bounding_box.
      - center_col: The middle column index of the bounding_box.
      - interior: The area within the bounding_box excluding the Blue (1) pixels themselves.
  - role: generated_pattern
    color: Magenta (6)
    origin: Derived from each input_object.
    components:
      - type: interior_fill
        location: Replaces Azure (8) pixels within the 'interior' of the corresponding input_object.
      - type: horizontal_line
        location: Spans the full grid width at the 'center_row' of the corresponding input_object.
      - type: vertical_line
        location: Spans the full grid height at the 'center_col' of the corresponding input_object.
relationships:
  - type: generation
    from: input_object (Blue 1)
    to: generated_pattern (Magenta 6)
    rule: Each input_object generates a corresponding interior fill and two centered lines (horizontal and vertical).
  - type: color_priority
    rule: >
      When determining the final color of a pixel in the output grid:
      1. If the input pixel was Blue (1), the output pixel remains Blue (1).
      2. If the input pixel was Azure (8) AND the pixel location corresponds to any generated_pattern component (interior fill, horizontal line, or vertical line from ANY input_object), the output pixel becomes Magenta (6).
      3. Otherwise (if the input pixel was Azure (8) and not part of any generated pattern), the output pixel remains Azure (8).
