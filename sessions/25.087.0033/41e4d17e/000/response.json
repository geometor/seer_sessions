These objects appear to be hollow squares or rectangles (specifically 5x5 hollow squares in the examples).\n4.  **Output Transformation:**\n    *   The original Blue (1) objects remain unchanged in the output grid.\n    *   Magenta (6) pixels are added to the output grid based on the location and properties of the Blue objects.\n    *   For each Blue object:\n        *   The hollow *interior* of the object is filled with Magenta (6), replacing the original Azure (8) background pixels within that space.\n        *   A horizontal line of Magenta (6) is drawn across the entire grid width, centered vertically on the Blue object.\n        *   A vertical line of Magenta (6) is drawn across the entire grid height, centered horizontally on the Blue object.\n    *   **Overlap Rule:** If a generated Magenta pixel (either from filling or lines) would fall on a location that was originally Blue (1), the pixel remains Blue (1). Otherwise, if the original pixel was Azure (8), it becomes Magenta (6). Magenta pixels can overwrite other Magenta pixels.\n5.  **Center Calculation:** The \"center\" for the lines and filling appears to correspond to the geometric center of the bounding box of each Blue object. For the 5x5 squares, this is the middle row and middle column.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

If the original color was Azure (8) AND *any* of the conditions (i, ii, or iii) are true, set the color of the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to Magenta (6).\n    d.
