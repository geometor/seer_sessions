Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are the same size (15x15 in these examples).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are Azure (8 - background), Blue (1 - input objects), and Magenta (6 - generated patterns).
3.  **Input Objects:** The input grids contain one or more distinct objects made of Blue (1) pixels. These objects appear to be hollow squares or rectangles (specifically 5x5 hollow squares in the examples).
4.  **Output Transformation:**
    *   The original Blue (1) objects remain unchanged in the output grid.
    *   Magenta (6) pixels are added to the output grid based on the location and properties of the Blue objects.
    *   For each Blue object:
        *   The hollow *interior* of the object is filled with Magenta (6), replacing the original Azure (8) background pixels within that space.
        *   A horizontal line of Magenta (6) is drawn across the entire grid width, centered vertically on the Blue object.
        *   A vertical line of Magenta (6) is drawn across the entire grid height, centered horizontally on the Blue object.
    *   **Overlap Rule:** If a generated Magenta pixel (either from filling or lines) would fall on a location that was originally Blue (1), the pixel remains Blue (1). Otherwise, if the original pixel was Azure (8), it becomes Magenta (6). Magenta pixels can overwrite other Magenta pixels.
5.  **Center Calculation:** The "center" for the lines and filling appears to correspond to the geometric center of the bounding box of each Blue object. For the 5x5 squares, this is the middle row and middle column.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - role: background
    color: Azure (8)
    pixels: Most pixels in the input grid.
  - role: input_object
    color: Blue (1)
    count: One or more per input grid.
    shape: Hollow squares/rectangles (specifically 5x5 hollow squares in examples).
    properties:
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing the object.
      - center_row: The middle row index of the bounding_box.
      - center_col: The middle column index of the bounding_box.
      - interior: The area within the bounding_box excluding the Blue (1) pixels themselves.
  - role: generated_pattern
    color: Magenta (6)
    origin: Derived from each input_object.
    components:
      - type: interior_fill
        location: Replaces Azure (8) pixels within the 'interior' of the corresponding input_object.
      - type: horizontal_line
        location: Spans the full grid width at the 'center_row' of the corresponding input_object.
      - type: vertical_line
        location: Spans the full grid height at the 'center_col' of the corresponding input_object.
relationships:
  - type: generation
    from: input_object (Blue 1)
    to: generated_pattern (Magenta 6)
    rule: Each input_object generates a corresponding interior fill and two centered lines (horizontal and vertical).
  - type: color_priority
    rule: >
      When determining the final color of a pixel in the output grid:
      1. If the input pixel was Blue (1), the output pixel remains Blue (1).
      2. If the input pixel was Azure (8) AND the pixel location corresponds to any generated_pattern component (interior fill, horizontal line, or vertical line from ANY input_object), the output pixel becomes Magenta (6).
      3. Otherwise (if the input pixel was Azure (8) and not part of any generated pattern), the output pixel remains Azure (8).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of Blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each identified Blue object:
    a.  Determine its bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column indices).
    b.  Calculate the center row index by averaging the minimum and maximum row indices (using integer division).
    c.  Calculate the center column index by averaging the minimum and maximum column indices (using integer division).
    d.  Store these center coordinates and bounding box dimensions.
4.  Iterate through each pixel (row `r`, column `c`) of the grid:
    a.  Check if the original color of the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the input grid is Azure (8).
    b.  If it is Azure (8), then determine if this pixel should be changed to Magenta (6) based on the following conditions (check against *all* identified Blue objects):
        i.  Is `r` equal to the center row of *any* Blue object?
        ii. Is `c` equal to the center column of *any* Blue object?
        iii. Does the pixel (`r`, `c`) fall strictly *inside* the bounding box of *any* Blue object? (i.e., `min_row < r < max_row` and `min_col < c < max_col`).
    c.  If the original color was Azure (8) AND *any* of the conditions (i, ii, or iii) are true, set the color of the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to Magenta (6).
    d.  If the original color was not Azure (8), or if it was Azure (8) but none of the conditions (i, ii, iii) were true, the pixel in the output grid retains its original color (copied in step 1).
5.  Return the final output grid.
