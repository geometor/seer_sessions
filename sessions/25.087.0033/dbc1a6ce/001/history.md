Okay, let's break down the task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels represented by integer color codes.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), blue (1), and azure (8). The input grids only contain white (0) and blue (1). The output grids contain white (0), blue (1), and azure (8).
3.  **Blue Pixels:** Blue pixels (1) appear sparsely distributed in the input grids. They remain in the same position in the output grids.
4.  **Azure Pixels:** Azure pixels (8) appear in the output grids but not the input. They seem to form straight lines (horizontal or vertical) connecting pairs of blue pixels.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying pairs of blue pixels that lie on the same row or the same column and then filling the segment of white pixels strictly between them with azure pixels. This happens for both horizontal and vertical alignments.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
task_description: "Identify pairs of blue pixels aligned horizontally or vertically and fill the white space between them with azure pixels."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  value_range: 0-9
  input_colors: [0, 1] # white, blue
  output_colors: [0, 1, 8] # white, blue, azure
objects:
  - object: blue_pixel
    definition: A single pixel with value 1.
    properties:
      - position: (row, column)
relationships:
  - relationship: aligned_pair
    definition: Two blue pixels that share the same row index or the same column index.
    properties:
      - type: horizontal (same row) or vertical (same column)
      - distance: The number of pixels between the pair (exclusive of the blue pixels).
      - intervening_pixels: The set of pixels located strictly between the pair along the shared row or column.
actions:
  - action: fill_between
    actor: system
    target: white_pixels (value 0) located between an aligned_pair of blue_pixels
    effect: Change the color of the target white pixels to azure (value 8).
    condition: The action applies only to pixels that are white (0) in the input grid.
constraints:
  - Blue pixels (1) from the input remain unchanged in the output.
  - Only white pixels (0) strictly between aligned blue pixel pairs are changed to azure (8).
  - The filling occurs independently for horizontal and vertical alignments.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid. Create a new grid, initially identical to the input grid, which will become the output grid.
2.  **Horizontal Scan:** For each row in the grid:
    a.  Identify the column positions of all blue pixels (value 1) within that row.
    b.  If there are two or more blue pixels in the row, consider all unique pairs of these blue pixels.
    c.  For each pair of blue pixels located at `(row, col1)` and `(row, col2)` (where `col1 < col2`):
        i.  Iterate through all columns `c` such that `col1 < c < col2`.
        ii. If the pixel at `(row, c)` in the *input* grid is white (value 0), change the corresponding pixel at `(row, c)` in the *output* grid to azure (value 8).
3.  **Vertical Scan:** For each column in the grid:
    a.  Identify the row positions of all blue pixels (value 1) within that column.
    b.  If there are two or more blue pixels in the column, consider all unique pairs of these blue pixels.
    c.  For each pair of blue pixels located at `(row1, col)` and `(row2, col)` (where `row1 < row2`):
        i.  Iterate through all rows `r` such that `row1 < r < row2`.
        ii. If the pixel at `(r, col)` in the *input* grid is white (value 0), change the corresponding pixel at `(r, col)` in the *output* grid to azure (value 8).
4.  The final modified grid is the result of the transformation.
