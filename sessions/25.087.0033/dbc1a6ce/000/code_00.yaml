task_description: "Identify pairs of blue pixels aligned horizontally or vertically and fill the white space between them with azure pixels."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  value_range: 0-9
  input_colors: [0, 1] # white, blue
  output_colors: [0, 1, 8] # white, blue, azure
objects:
  - object: blue_pixel
    definition: A single pixel with value 1.
    properties:
      - position: (row, column)
relationships:
  - relationship: aligned_pair
    definition: Two blue pixels that share the same row index or the same column index.
    properties:
      - type: horizontal (same row) or vertical (same column)
      - distance: The number of pixels between the pair (exclusive of the blue pixels).
      - intervening_pixels: The set of pixels located strictly between the pair along the shared row or column.
actions:
  - action: fill_between
    actor: system
    target: white_pixels (value 0) located between an aligned_pair of blue_pixels
    effect: Change the color of the target white pixels to azure (value 8).
    condition: The action applies only to pixels that are white (0) in the input grid.
constraints:
  - Blue pixels (1) from the input remain unchanged in the output.
  - Only white pixels (0) strictly between aligned blue pixel pairs are changed to azure (8).
  - The filling occurs independently for horizontal and vertical alignments.
