The input grids only contain white (0) and blue (1). The output grids contain white (0), blue (1), and azure (8).\n3.  **Blue Pixels:** Blue pixels (1) appear sparsely distributed in the input grids. They remain in the same position in the output grids.\n4.  **Azure Pixels:** Azure pixels (8) appear in the output grids but not the input. They seem to form straight lines (horizontal or vertical) connecting pairs of blue pixels.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying pairs of blue pixels that lie on the same row or the same column and then filling the segment of white pixels strictly between them with azure pixels. This happens for both horizontal and vertical alignments.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
