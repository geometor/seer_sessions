            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 10x10 grids for both input and output.\n2.  **Static Regions:** Several regions remain unchanged across all examples:\n    *   The gray horizontal line (color 5) at row index 6.\n    *   The white row (color 0) at row index 7.\n    *   The multi-colored row at row index 8 (let's call this the \"key row\").\n    *   The white row (color 0) at row index 9.\n    *   The top row (row 0) containing azure (color 8) and white (color 0) pixels.\n3.  **Dynamic Region:** Changes occur only in the rectangular area between the top row and the gray line, specifically rows 1 through 5 (inclusive). This area is initially white (color 0) in the input.\n4.  **Control Elements:**\n    *   The number of azure (8) pixels in the top row (row 0) seems to control the transformation. Let's call this count `N`.\n    *   The colors and their positions in the key row (row 8) determine *which* columns are modified and *what* color is used.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** Vertical lines are drawn in the dynamic region (rows 1-5).\n    *   The *color* of a vertical line corresponds to a color found in the key row (row 8).\n    *   The *column* where a line is drawn corresponds to the column where that specific color appears in the key row.\n    *   The *height* of the vertical lines appears to be equal to `N`, the count of azure pixels in row 0.\n    *   The lines seem to \"hang\" from the gray line separator, extending upwards. Specifically, they occupy rows `(6 - N)` through `5`.\n6.  **Color Selection Logic:** The crucial step is selecting which colors from the key row (row 8) trigger the drawing of lines. By comparing `N` (azure count in row 0) with the frequency of colors in row 8, a pattern emerges: A color `C` from row 8 is selected if and only if it appears exactly `N` times in row 8.\n7.  **Multiple Colors:** If multiple distinct colors in row 8 satisfy the frequency condition (appearing `N` times), lines are drawn for *all* such colors in their respective columns.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
