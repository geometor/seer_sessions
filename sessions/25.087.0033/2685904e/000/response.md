Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 10x10 grids for both input and output.
2.  **Static Regions:** Several regions remain unchanged across all examples:
    *   The gray horizontal line (color 5) at row index 6.
    *   The white row (color 0) at row index 7.
    *   The multi-colored row at row index 8 (let's call this the "key row").
    *   The white row (color 0) at row index 9.
    *   The top row (row 0) containing azure (color 8) and white (color 0) pixels.
3.  **Dynamic Region:** Changes occur only in the rectangular area between the top row and the gray line, specifically rows 1 through 5 (inclusive). This area is initially white (color 0) in the input.
4.  **Control Elements:**
    *   The number of azure (8) pixels in the top row (row 0) seems to control the transformation. Let's call this count `N`.
    *   The colors and their positions in the key row (row 8) determine *which* columns are modified and *what* color is used.
5.  **Transformation Pattern:** Vertical lines are drawn in the dynamic region (rows 1-5).
    *   The *color* of a vertical line corresponds to a color found in the key row (row 8).
    *   The *column* where a line is drawn corresponds to the column where that specific color appears in the key row.
    *   The *height* of the vertical lines appears to be equal to `N`, the count of azure pixels in row 0.
    *   The lines seem to "hang" from the gray line separator, extending upwards. Specifically, they occupy rows `(6 - N)` through `5`.
6.  **Color Selection Logic:** The crucial step is selecting which colors from the key row (row 8) trigger the drawing of lines. By comparing `N` (azure count in row 0) with the frequency of colors in row 8, a pattern emerges: A color `C` from row 8 is selected if and only if it appears exactly `N` times in row 8.
7.  **Multiple Colors:** If multiple distinct colors in row 8 satisfy the frequency condition (appearing `N` times), lines are drawn for *all* such colors in their respective columns.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid. Create a copy of it to serve as the output grid.
2.  Count the number of azure (color 8) pixels in the first row (row 0) of the input grid. Store this count as `N`.
3.  Analyze the second-to-last row (row 8) of the input grid. For each distinct color present in this row (ignoring white, color 0), count how many times it appears.
4.  Identify all colors `C` whose count in row 8 is exactly equal to `N`.
5.  If no colors satisfy this condition, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
6.  If one or more colors `C` satisfy the condition:
    a. For each such color `C`:
        i. Find all column indices `j` where the color `C` appears in row 8 (i.e., `input[8][j] == C`).
        ii. For each found column index `j`:
            *   Determine the starting row index for the vertical line: `start_row = 6 - N`.
            *   Determine the ending row index for the vertical line: `end_row = 5`.
            *   Iterate from `row = start_row` to `end_row` (inclusive). In the output grid, set the pixel at `[row][j]` to the color `C`.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
