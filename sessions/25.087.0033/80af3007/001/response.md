Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the smallest bounding box enclosing all gray pixels (5) in the input grid. Let its top-left corner be (r0, c0). Assume the relevant area based on this corner is 9x9.
2. Initialize a 9x9 output grid filled with white pixels (0).
3. Define a specific 3x3 gray pattern P = [[5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 5], [5, 5, 0]].
4. Iterate through the 9x9 relevant input area (starting at (r0, c0)) in 3x3 subgrids (blocks). There are 9 such blocks arranged in a 3x3 grid (block indices R=0..2, C=0..2).
5. For each 3x3 input subgrid:
    a. Check if it contains *any* gray pixels (5).
    b. If it does, place the pattern P into the corresponding 3x3 location in the output grid. The output location (row=R*3, col=C*3) corresponds to the input block's indices (R, C).
    c. If it does not contain gray pixels, leave the corresponding 3x3 area in the output grid white (0).
6. Return the final 9x9 output grid.
