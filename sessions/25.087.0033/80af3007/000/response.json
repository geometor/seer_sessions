            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Analysis**: The input grids are relatively large (16x18 in the examples) and primarily composed of white pixels (0). They contain one or more distinct rectangular shapes made of gray pixels (5). These gray shapes vary in size, number, and position across the examples.\n2.  **Output Grid Analysis**: The output grids are consistently 9x9 in size. They are composed of white (0) and gray (5) pixels. The arrangement of gray pixels in the output forms a distinct, repeating 3x3 pattern: `[[5,5,0],[0,0,5],[5,5,0]]`.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern**: The output grid seems to be constructed as a 3x3 grid of \"tiles\". Each tile is either the specific 3x3 gray pattern mentioned above or a 3x3 block of white pixels.\n4.  **Input-Output Relationship**: The placement of the gray pattern tiles versus the white tiles in the 3x3 output grid structure appears to be determined by the distribution of gray pixels within the input grid. Specifically, it relates to whether corresponding 3x3 sections within a 9x9 bounding box of the input's gray pixels contain any gray pixels.\n5.  **Key Observation**: The core transformation involves:\n    *   Identifying the relevant 9x9 area in the input containing all gray pixels (the bounding box).\n    *   Dividing this 9x9 input area into nine 3x3 sub-regions.\n    *   Checking each 3x3 sub-region for the presence of *any* gray pixel.\n    *   Constructing the 9x9 output grid by placing a specific 3x3 gray pattern where the corresponding input sub-region contained gray, and a 3x3 white block otherwise.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices containing gray pixels. This defines the smallest bounding box enclosing all gray pixels. Let the top-left corner of this bounding box be `(r0, c0)`. (Based on the examples, this bounding box is expected to be 9x9).\n3.  **Define Pattern**: Define the fixed 3x3 gray pattern `P` as `[[5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 5], [5, 5, 0]]`.\n4.  **Process Subregions**: Iterate through a 3x3 grid of block indices, `R` from 0 to 2 and `C` from 0 to 2.\n5.  **Check Input Subregion**: For each `(R, C)` pair:\n    *   Define the corresponding 3x3 input subregion using the bounding box origin `(r0, c0)`: rows from `r0 + R*3` to `r0 + R*3 + 2`, and columns from `c0 + C*3` to `c0 + C*3 + 2`.\n    *   Examine all pixels within this 3x3 input subregion.\n    *   Determine if *at least one* pixel in this subregion is gray (5).\n6.  **Place Output Tile**:\n    *   If the input subregion examined in the previous step contains at least one gray pixel:\n        *   Calculate the top-left corner for the output tile: `(output_r, output_c) = (R*3, C*3)`.\n        *   Copy the 3x3 pattern `P` into the output grid starting at `(output_r, output_c)`.\n    *   If the input subregion contains *no* gray pixels, leave the corresponding 3x3 area in the output grid as white (it was initialized as white).\n7.  **Finalize**: After iterating through all nine `(R, C)` pairs, the 9x9 output grid contains the final transformed pattern.
