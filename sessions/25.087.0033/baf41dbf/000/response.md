Okay, let's analyze the task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use white (0), green (3), and magenta (6).
2.  **Objects:** The main objects are:
    *   Green "frames": These appear as hollow rectangles made of green pixels.
    *   Magenta "markers": These are single magenta pixels scattered around the grid.
3.  **Transformation:** The green frames in the input are replaced by larger green frames in the output. The size and position of the new frames seem determined by the positions of the magenta markers relative to the original green frames.
4.  **Interaction:** Each green frame seems to interact with the magenta markers located outside its initial boundary. The frame expands outwards towards these markers.
5.  **Frame Expansion:** If a magenta marker is found above, below, to the left, or to the right of an original green frame, the frame's boundary extends in that direction to align with the row or column of the marker.
6.  **Multiple Frames/Markers:** The transformation applies independently to each green frame based on the surrounding magenta markers (as seen in Example 3).
7.  **Output Content:** The original green frame is erased. A new, larger green frame is drawn based on the expanded boundaries. The area strictly inside the new frame is filled with white (0). The magenta markers remain in their original positions in the output grid.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Expand green frames based on external magenta markers.

Input_Features:
  - Grids containing pixels of white(0), green(3), magenta(6).
  - Green pixels form hollow rectangular frames (Objects: GreenFrame).
  - Magenta pixels act as single markers (Objects: MagentaMarker).

Output_Features:
  - Grids containing pixels of white(0), green(3), magenta(6).
  - Green frames from the input are replaced by potentially larger green frames.
  - Magenta markers persist in their original locations.
  - The interior of the new green frames is white(0).

Transformation_Rules:
  - Identify all GreenFrames in the input.
  - Identify all MagentaMarkers in the input.
  - For each GreenFrame:
    - Determine its bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
    - Initialize new bounding box coordinates: new_min_row, new_min_col, new_max_row, new_max_col = min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col.
    - Search for MagentaMarkers located strictly outside the initial bounding box:
      - If a marker exists above (row < min_row), update new_min_row to the minimum row of such markers found.
      - If a marker exists below (row > max_row), update new_max_row to the maximum row of such markers found.
      - If a marker exists left (col < min_col), update new_min_col to the minimum column of such markers found.
      - If a marker exists right (col > max_col), update new_max_col to the maximum column of such markers found.
    - The final bounding box for the new frame uses the minimum of the original and marker-determined coordinates for the top-left corner (new_min_row, new_min_col) and the maximum for the bottom-right corner (new_max_row, new_max_col). Effectively, the box expands outwards to encompass the region up to the markers.
  - Processing Steps:
    - Create an output grid, initially a copy of the input.
    - Store the locations of all MagentaMarkers.
    - For each identified GreenFrame:
      - Calculate the new bounding box coordinates as described above.
      - Erase the original green pixels belonging to this frame from the output grid (set to white(0)).
      - Clear the entire rectangular area defined by the *new* bounding box (inclusive) to white(0) in the output grid.
      - Draw a new green frame along the perimeter of the *new* bounding box in the output grid.
    - After processing all frames, redraw all original MagentaMarkers at their stored locations in the output grid. This ensures they are preserved, even if the frame expansion cleared their original location.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find the coordinates of all magenta pixels (color 6) in the input grid and store them.
3.  Find all distinct green objects (contiguous areas of color 3). Verify they form hollow rectangular frames.
4.  For each green frame found:
    a.  Determine the row and column boundaries (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) of the original frame.
    b.  Set the initial new boundary coordinates equal to the original boundaries.
    c.  Check for magenta pixels located outside the original frame's boundaries:
        i.  Find the minimum row among magenta pixels above the frame (row < min_row). If any exist, update the new top boundary (`new_min_row`) to this minimum row.
        ii. Find the maximum row among magenta pixels below the frame (row > max_row). If any exist, update the new bottom boundary (`new_max_row`) to this maximum row.
        iii. Find the minimum column among magenta pixels left of the frame (col < min_col). If any exist, update the new left boundary (`new_min_col`) to this minimum column.
        iv. Find the maximum column among magenta pixels right of the frame (col > max_col). If any exist, update the new right boundary (`new_max_col`) to this maximum column.
    d.  Iterate through all pixels within the original frame's bounding box (`r` from `min_row` to `max_row`, `c` from `min_col` to `max_col`) in the output grid. If a pixel belongs to the original green frame (color 3), change its color to white (0).
    e.  Iterate through all pixels within the *new* frame's bounding box (`r` from `new_min_row` to `new_max_row`, `c` from `new_min_col` to `new_max_col`) in the output grid. Change the color of all these pixels to white (0).
    f.  Draw the new green frame border on the output grid: Set pixels to green (3) along the top edge (`new_min_row`), bottom edge (`new_max_row`), left edge (`new_min_col`), and right edge (`new_max_col`) within the new bounding box.
5.  After processing all green frames, iterate through the stored coordinates of the original magenta pixels. For each coordinate (r, c), set the pixel at `output_grid[r][c]` to magenta (6).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
