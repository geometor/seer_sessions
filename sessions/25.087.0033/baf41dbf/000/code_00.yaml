Task: Expand green frames based on external magenta markers.

Input_Features:
  - Grids containing pixels of white(0), green(3), magenta(6).
  - Green pixels form hollow rectangular frames (Objects: GreenFrame).
  - Magenta pixels act as single markers (Objects: MagentaMarker).

Output_Features:
  - Grids containing pixels of white(0), green(3), magenta(6).
  - Green frames from the input are replaced by potentially larger green frames.
  - Magenta markers persist in their original locations.
  - The interior of the new green frames is white(0).

Transformation_Rules:
  - Identify all GreenFrames in the input.
  - Identify all MagentaMarkers in the input.
  - For each GreenFrame:
    - Determine its bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
    - Initialize new bounding box coordinates: new_min_row, new_min_col, new_max_row, new_max_col = min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col.
    - Search for MagentaMarkers located strictly outside the initial bounding box:
      - If a marker exists above (row < min_row), update new_min_row to the minimum row of such markers found.
      - If a marker exists below (row > max_row), update new_max_row to the maximum row of such markers found.
      - If a marker exists left (col < min_col), update new_min_col to the minimum column of such markers found.
      - If a marker exists right (col > max_col), update new_max_col to the maximum column of such markers found.
    - The final bounding box for the new frame uses the minimum of the original and marker-determined coordinates for the top-left corner (new_min_row, new_min_col) and the maximum for the bottom-right corner (new_max_row, new_max_col). Effectively, the box expands outwards to encompass the region up to the markers.
  - Processing Steps:
    - Create an output grid, initially a copy of the input.
    - Store the locations of all MagentaMarkers.
    - For each identified GreenFrame:
      - Calculate the new bounding box coordinates as described above.
      - Erase the original green pixels belonging to this frame from the output grid (set to white(0)).
      - Clear the entire rectangular area defined by the *new* bounding box (inclusive) to white(0) in the output grid.
      - Draw a new green frame along the perimeter of the *new* bounding box in the output grid.
    - After processing all frames, redraw all original MagentaMarkers at their stored locations in the output grid. This ensures they are preserved, even if the frame expansion cleared their original location.
