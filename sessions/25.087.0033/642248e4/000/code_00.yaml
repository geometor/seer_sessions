task_elements:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - contains pixels with colors (0-9)
      - has dimensions (height, width)

objects:
  - name: border
    properties:
      - is a line (row or column) of a single non-white color
      - located at the edge of the grid (top, bottom, left, or right)
      - two borders exist per grid (e.g., top and bottom, or left and right)
      - each border has a specific color (border_color) and location (border_edge)

  - name: blue_pixel
    properties:
      - color is blue (1)
      - located within the grid, not on the borders
      - has coordinates (row, col)

  - name: white_neighbor
    properties:
      - color is white (0)
      - located orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a blue_pixel
      - has coordinates (row, col)

relationships_and_actions:
  - type: proximity_check_blue_to_borders
    description: For each blue_pixel, determine which of the two borders it is closer to based on row index (for top/bottom borders) or column index (for left/right borders).
    result: Identifies the closer_border (border_edge and border_color) for each blue_pixel.

  - type: proximity_check_neighbor_to_border
    description: For a given blue_pixel and its identified closer_border, find the white_neighbor that is closest to that same closer_border (using row/column index).
    result: Identifies the target_neighbor for recoloring.

  - type: recoloring_action
    description: Change the color of the target_neighbor to the border_color of the closer_border associated with the blue_pixel it neighbors.
    condition: Only white_neighbors are candidates for recoloring.
    effect: Modifies the grid by changing the color of specific white pixels.

invariants:
  - The original border pixels remain unchanged.
  - The original blue (1) pixels remain unchanged.
  - Pixels not affected by the recoloring_action remain unchanged.
