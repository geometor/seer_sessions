They also feature distinct, single-colored borders.\n2.  **Border Types:** In the examples, these borders appear either as the topmost and bottommost rows (train\\_1, train\\_2) or the leftmost and rightmost columns (train\\_3). The border colors are consistent within each border but differ between the two borders in a given grid (e.g., red top, yellow bottom; azure top, green bottom; green left, yellow right).\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, maintaining the original borders and blue pixels. The key difference is that some white (0) pixels adjacent to the blue pixels have been changed to match the color of one of the borders.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation seems to involve the blue (1) pixels influencing their immediate white (0) neighbors. The color assigned to a white neighbor depends on:\n    *   Which border (e.g., top or bottom, left or right) the blue pixel is closer to.\n    *   Which of the blue pixel's white neighbors is closest to that specific border.\n    *   The color of the closer border is then applied to that closest white neighbor.\n5.  **Proximity:** Proximity appears to be calculated based on row or column indices (Manhattan distance). For horizontal borders (top/bottom), the row index determines closeness. For vertical borders (left/right), the column index determines closeness.\n6.  **Neighbor Selection:** Only orthogonal (up, down, left, right) white neighbors are considered. Among these, the one with the minimum distance to the relevant border is selected for recoloring.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the two border lines in the input grid:\n    *   Check if the top row consists of a single non-white color and the bottom row consists of a single (potentially different) non-white color. If so, record the top border color/row and bottom border color/row.\n    *   Alternatively, check if the left column consists of a single non-white color and the right column consists of a single (potentially different) non-white color. If so, record the left border color/column and right border color/column.\n3.  Find the coordinates (row, col) of all blue (1) pixels in the input grid, excluding any on the identified borders.\n4.  For each blue pixel found at `(blue_row, blue_col)`:\n    a.  Determine the closer border:\n        *   If borders are top (row `t`) and bottom (row `b`): Compare distance `blue_row - t` with `b - blue_row`. The smaller distance indicates the closer border. Record its color (`closer_border_color`) and its edge coordinate (`closer_border_edge`, which is `t` or `b`).\n        *   If borders are left (col `l`) and right (col `r`): Compare distance `blue_col - l` with `r - blue_col`. The smaller distance indicates the closer border. Record its color (`closer_border_color`) and its edge coordinate (`closer_border_edge`, which is `l` or `r`).\n        *   (Assumption: If distances are equal, no action is taken for this blue pixel, though this case isn't explicitly shown in examples).\n    b.  Identify potential target neighbors: Find all orthogonally adjacent coordinates `(nr, nc)` to the blue pixel `(blue_row, blue_col)`.\n    c.  Filter for valid targets: Keep only those adjacent coordinates `(nr, nc)` where the pixel in the *input* grid is white (0).\n    d.  Find the closest target neighbor: Among the valid white neighbors, find the one `(target_row, target_col)` that has the minimum distance to the `closer_border_edge`.\n        *   If borders are top/bottom, minimize `abs(neighbor_row - closer_border_edge)`.\n        *   If borders are left/right, minimize `abs(neighbor_col - closer_border_edge)`.\n        *   (Assumption: If multiple neighbors are equally closest, the examples don't specify tie-breaking; a consistent rule like preferring lower row/col index or simply picking the first found might work, but the simplest seems to be finding the *single* minimum).\n    e.  Recolor the target: If a unique closest white neighbor `(target_row, target_col)` is found, update the *output* grid at `(target_row, target_col)` with the `closer_border_color`.\n5.  Return the modified output grid."
