Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids seem composed of multiple distinct blocks stacked vertically. In `train_1`, there appear to be three 8-row blocks. In `train_2`, there appear to be three 7-row blocks. The blocks within a single input might be identical or slightly varied.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid in each example is significantly shorter than the input grid. The height of the output grid matches the height of the first block identified in the input (8 rows for `train_1`, 7 rows for `train_2`).
3.  **Content Preservation:** The output grid strongly resembles the *first* block of the input grid. Many elements, particularly border patterns (yellow in `train_1`, azure in `train_2`), seem copied directly.
4.  **Content Modification:** Some shapes within the first block appear altered in the output.
    *   In `train_1`, the vertical green line (col 2) becomes a 2x3 green rectangle (cols 2-4), and the azure L-shape (cols 7-8) becomes a 2x3 azure rectangle (cols 7-9).
    *   In `train_2`, the blue shape (cols 2-3) expands into cols 2-5, and the yellow T-shape (cols 3-5) expands into cols 3-6.
5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The modification consistently involves extending shapes horizontally to the right. The amount of extension seems fixed at 2 columns for all modified shapes in both examples. Shapes that touch the boundary of the block (the yellow/azure borders) are *not* extended. The background color (blue in `train_1`, red in `train_2`) remains unchanged and fills the space not occupied by other shapes. The background color appears to be the most frequent color within the first block.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Identify the first repeating vertical block in the input grid and modify specific shapes within it to produce the output grid.

definitions:
  - name: vertical_block
    description: A repeating segment of rows in the input grid. The height 'H' is determined by the first row index (>= 1) that is identical to row 0.
  - name: first_block
    description: The top H rows of the input grid.
  - name: background_color
    description: The color that appears most frequently within the first_block.
  - name: internal_shape
    description: A connected group of pixels of the same color within the first_block, excluding the background_color, that does not touch the top, bottom, left, or right border of the first_block.
  - name: border_shape
    description: A connected group of pixels of the same color within the first_block, excluding the background_color, that touches at least one border (top, bottom, left, right) of the first_block.

transformation:
  - action: determine_block_height
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [block_height 'H']
    description: Find the smallest row index H >= 1 such that row H is identical to row 0. If no such row exists, H is the total height of the input grid.
  - action: extract_first_block
    inputs: [input_grid, block_height 'H']
    outputs: [first_block_grid]
    description: Select the top H rows from the input_grid.
  - action: identify_background_color
    inputs: [first_block_grid]
    outputs: [background_color_value]
    description: Find the most frequent color value in the first_block_grid.
  - action: identify_shapes
    inputs: [first_block_grid, background_color_value]
    outputs: [list_of_internal_shapes, list_of_border_shapes]
    description: Find all connected components of non-background colors. Classify them as internal_shape or border_shape based on contact with the block's borders.
  - action: modify_internal_shapes
    inputs: [list_of_internal_shapes]
    outputs: [list_of_modified_shapes]
    description: For each internal_shape, extend it horizontally to the right by 2 columns. Every pixel (r, c) in the original shape results in pixels (r, c), (r, c+1), and (r, c+2) being added to the modified shape, colored with the shape's original color. Overlapping pixels retain the color.
  - action: construct_output
    inputs: [first_block_grid, block_height 'H', background_color_value, list_of_border_shapes, list_of_modified_shapes]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: Create a new grid of height H and the same width as the input. Initialize with the background_color. Draw the border_shapes (unchanged) and the modified_internal_shapes onto this grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Determine the Unit Height (H):** Compare row 0 of the input grid with subsequent rows (row 1, row 2, ...). The height `H` is the index of the first row that is identical to row 0.
2.  **Extract the First Unit:** Create a new grid consisting of only the top `H` rows of the input grid.
3.  **Identify Background Color:** Find the color that appears most frequently in this extracted unit grid. This is the background color.
4.  **Identify Shapes:** Find all connected groups of pixels within the unit grid that are *not* the background color.
5.  **Process Shapes:** For each identified shape:
    a.  Check if any pixel of the shape lies on the border of the unit grid (row 0, row H-1, column 0, or the last column).
    b.  If the shape **does not** touch the border: Create a modified version of the shape by taking each pixel `(r, c)` of the original shape and adding pixels `(r, c+1)` and `(r, c+2)` with the same color. Ensure the new pixels stay within the grid boundaries. If multiple shapes want to color the same pixel, the result is determined by the drawing order (though overlaps didn't seem to occur with different colors in the examples).
    c.  If the shape **does** touch the border: Keep the shape as it is.
6.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the extracted unit (H rows, same width as input). Fill it entirely with the background color identified in step 3. Then, draw all the processed shapes (modified non-border shapes and original border shapes) onto this grid, overwriting the background color. This is the final output grid.
