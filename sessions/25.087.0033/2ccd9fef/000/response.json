            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids seem composed of multiple distinct blocks stacked vertically. In `train_1`, there appear to be three 8-row blocks. In `train_2`, there appear to be three 7-row blocks. The blocks within a single input might be identical or slightly varied.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid in each example is significantly shorter than the input grid. The height of the output grid matches the height of the first block identified in the input (8 rows for `train_1`, 7 rows for `train_2`).\n3.  **Content Preservation:** The output grid strongly resembles the *first* block of the input grid. Many elements, particularly border patterns (yellow in `train_1`, azure in `train_2`), seem copied directly.\n4.  **Content Modification:** Some shapes within the first block appear altered in the output.\n    *   In `train_1`, the vertical green line (col 2) becomes a 2x3 green rectangle (cols 2-4), and the azure L-shape (cols 7-8) becomes a 2x3 azure rectangle (cols 7-9).\n    *   In `train_2`, the blue shape (cols 2-3) expands into cols 2-5, and the yellow T-shape (cols 3-5) expands into cols 3-6.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The modification consistently involves extending shapes horizontally to the right. The amount of extension seems fixed at 2 columns for all modified shapes in both examples. Shapes that touch the boundary of the block (the yellow/azure borders) are *not* extended. The background color (blue in `train_1`, red in `train_2`) remains unchanged and fills the space not occupied by other shapes. The background color appears to be the most frequent color within the first block.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

The height `H` is the index of the first row that is identical to row 0.\n2.  **Extract the First Unit:** Create a new grid consisting of only the top `H` rows of the input grid.\n3.  **Identify Background Color:** Find the color that appears most frequently in this extracted unit grid. This is the background color.\n4.  **Identify Shapes:** Find all connected groups of pixels within the unit grid that are *not* the background color.\n5.  **Process Shapes:** For each identified shape:\n    a.  Check if any pixel of the shape lies on the border of the unit grid (row 0, row H-1, column 0, or the last column).\n    b.  If the shape **does not** touch the border: Create a modified version of the shape by taking each pixel `(r, c)` of the original shape and adding pixels `(r, c+1)` and `(r, c+2)` with the same color. Ensure the new pixels stay within the grid boundaries. If multiple shapes want to color the same pixel, the result is determined by the drawing order (though overlaps didn't seem to occur with different colors in the examples).\n    c.  If the shape **does** touch the border: Keep the shape as it is.\n6.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the extracted unit (H rows, same width as input). Fill it entirely with the background color identified in step 3. Then, draw all the processed shapes (modified non-border shapes and original border shapes) onto this grid, overwriting the background color. This is the final output grid."
