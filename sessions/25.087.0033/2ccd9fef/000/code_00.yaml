task_description: Identify the first repeating vertical block in the input grid and modify specific shapes within it to produce the output grid.

definitions:
  - name: vertical_block
    description: A repeating segment of rows in the input grid. The height 'H' is determined by the first row index (>= 1) that is identical to row 0.
  - name: first_block
    description: The top H rows of the input grid.
  - name: background_color
    description: The color that appears most frequently within the first_block.
  - name: internal_shape
    description: A connected group of pixels of the same color within the first_block, excluding the background_color, that does not touch the top, bottom, left, or right border of the first_block.
  - name: border_shape
    description: A connected group of pixels of the same color within the first_block, excluding the background_color, that touches at least one border (top, bottom, left, right) of the first_block.

transformation:
  - action: determine_block_height
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [block_height 'H']
    description: Find the smallest row index H >= 1 such that row H is identical to row 0. If no such row exists, H is the total height of the input grid.
  - action: extract_first_block
    inputs: [input_grid, block_height 'H']
    outputs: [first_block_grid]
    description: Select the top H rows from the input_grid.
  - action: identify_background_color
    inputs: [first_block_grid]
    outputs: [background_color_value]
    description: Find the most frequent color value in the first_block_grid.
  - action: identify_shapes
    inputs: [first_block_grid, background_color_value]
    outputs: [list_of_internal_shapes, list_of_border_shapes]
    description: Find all connected components of non-background colors. Classify them as internal_shape or border_shape based on contact with the block's borders.
  - action: modify_internal_shapes
    inputs: [list_of_internal_shapes]
    outputs: [list_of_modified_shapes]
    description: For each internal_shape, extend it horizontally to the right by 2 columns. Every pixel (r, c) in the original shape results in pixels (r, c), (r, c+1), and (r, c+2) being added to the modified shape, colored with the shape's original color. Overlapping pixels retain the color.
  - action: construct_output
    inputs: [first_block_grid, block_height 'H', background_color_value, list_of_border_shapes, list_of_modified_shapes]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: Create a new grid of height H and the same width as the input. Initialize with the background_color. Draw the border_shapes (unchanged) and the modified_internal_shapes onto this grid.
