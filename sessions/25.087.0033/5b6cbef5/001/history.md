Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Dimensions:** All input examples are 4x4 grids. All output examples are 16x16 grids. This suggests a scaling factor of 4 in both height and width.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of smaller blocks, each the size of the input grid (4x4). The overall arrangement is a 4x4 grid of these blocks.
3.  **Content Mapping:** Comparing input and output grids reveals a pattern:
    *   Consider the output grid as a 4x4 arrangement of "slots" or "block positions".
    *   Each position `(block_row, block_col)` in this 4x4 arrangement corresponds to a pixel `(row, col)` in the *input* grid where `block_row = row` and `block_col = col`.
    *   If the pixel at `(row, col)` in the input grid is *not* white (color 0), then the corresponding 4x4 block in the output grid (starting at `output_row = row * 4`, `output_col = col * 4`) is an exact copy of the original 4x4 input grid.
    *   If the pixel at `(row, col)` in the input grid *is* white (color 0), then the corresponding 4x4 block in the output grid is filled entirely with white (color 0).
4.  **Color Consistency:** The colors from the input grid are preserved when copied into the output blocks. The "fill" color for empty blocks is consistently white (0), which is also the background color observed in the inputs.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_type: pattern_repetition_conditional
input_grid:
  properties:
    height: H_in
    width: W_in
    pixels: variable colors
output_grid:
  properties:
    height: H_out = H_in * H_in
    width: W_out = W_in * W_in
    structure: grid of blocks, size H_in x W_in
    block_dimensions: H_in x W_in
transformation:
  description: Conditional tiling based on input pixel color.
  steps:
    - Iterate through each pixel (row, col) of the input grid.
    - Determine the color C of the input pixel at (row, col).
    - Define the corresponding block region in the output grid:
        start_row = row * H_in
        start_col = col * W_in
        end_row = start_row + H_in
        end_col = start_col + W_in
    - Condition:
        - If C is not the background color (white, 0):
            Action: Copy the entire input grid into the output block region.
        - If C is the background color (white, 0):
            Action: Fill the output block region with the background color (white, 0).
constants:
  background_color: 0 # white
relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are determined by squaring the input grid dimensions.
  - The placement of input grid copies within the output grid is dictated by the positions of non-background pixels in the input grid.
  - The placement of background-filled blocks within the output grid is dictated by the positions of background pixels in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the dimensions (height `H` and width `W`) of the input grid. In all examples, H=4 and W=4.
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `(H * H)` by `(W * W)`. Initialize it with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid using its row index `r` (from 0 to H-1) and column index `c` (from 0 to W-1).
4.  For each input cell `(r, c)`, check its color value.
5.  **If** the color value at `(r, c)` in the input grid is *not* white (0):
    *   Identify the target block region in the output grid. This region starts at row `r * H` and column `c * W`, and has dimensions `H` by `W`.
    *   Copy the *entire* original input grid into this target block region of the output grid.
6.  **Else** (if the color value at `(r, c)` in the input grid *is* white (0)):
    *   Identify the target block region in the output grid (same calculation as step 5a).
    *   Ensure this target block region is filled entirely with the white color (0). (Since the grid was initialized to white, no action might be needed, but explicitly filling ensures correctness).
7.  Return the completed output grid.
