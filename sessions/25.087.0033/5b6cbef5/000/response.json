This suggests a scaling factor of 4 in both height and width.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of smaller blocks, each the size of the input grid (4x4). The overall arrangement is a 4x4 grid of these blocks.\n3.  **Content Mapping:** Comparing input and output grids reveals a pattern:\n    *   Consider the output grid as a 4x4 arrangement of \"slots\" or \"block positions\".\n    *   Each position `(block_row, block_col)` in this 4x4 arrangement corresponds to a pixel `(row, col)` in the *input* grid where `block_row = row` and `block_col = col`.\n    *   If the pixel at `(row, col)` in the input grid is *not* white (color 0), then the corresponding 4x4 block in the output grid (starting at `output_row = row * 4`, `output_col = col * 4`) is an exact copy of the original 4x4 input grid.\n    *   If the pixel at `(row, col)` in the input grid *is* white (color 0), then the corresponding 4x4 block in the output grid is filled entirely with white (color 0).\n4.  **Color Consistency:** The colors from the input grid are preserved when copied into the output blocks. The \"fill\" color for empty blocks is consistently white (0), which is also the background color observed in the inputs.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
