  description: Conditional tiling based on input pixel color.
  steps:
    - Iterate through each pixel (row, col) of the input grid.
    - Determine the color C of the input pixel at (row, col).
    - Define the corresponding block region in the output grid:
        start_row = row * H_in
        start_col = col * W_in
        end_row = start_row + H_in
        end_col = start_col + W_in
    - Condition:
        - If C is not the background color (white, 0):
            Action: Copy the entire input grid into the output block region.
        - If C is the background color (white, 0):
            Action: Fill the output block region with the background color (white, 0).
constants:
  background_color: 0 # white
relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are determined by squaring the input grid dimensions.
  - The placement of input grid copies within the output grid is dictated by the positions of non-background pixels in the input grid.
  - The placement of background-filled blocks within the output grid is dictated by the positions of background pixels in the input grid.
