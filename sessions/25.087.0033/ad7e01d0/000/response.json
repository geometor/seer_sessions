All examples use square grids (3x3 or 4x4).\n    *   The output is a significantly larger grid, also square.\n    *   The output grid appears to be composed of multiple smaller blocks or tiles arranged in a larger grid structure.\n    *   The size of these tiles seems to match the size of the original input grid.\n    *   Some tiles in the output grid are exact copies of the input grid.\n    *   Other tiles are uniformly filled with the white color (0).\n    *   The arrangement of the input-copy tiles and the white tiles forms a pattern. The dimensions of this pattern grid match the dimensions of the original input grid.\n    *   Comparing the input grid's pixel colors to the pattern of tiles in the output suggests a direct relationship: the color of a pixel at `(r, c)` in the input determines whether the tile at `(r, c)` in the output's meta-grid is a copy of the input or a white block.\n    *   Specifically, observing across examples, it appears that if the input pixel is gray (5), the corresponding tile in the output is a copy of the input. If the input pixel is white (0) or any other non-gray color (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9), the corresponding tile is a white block.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
