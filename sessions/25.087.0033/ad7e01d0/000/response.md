*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input is a grid of pixels with varying colors. All examples use square grids (3x3 or 4x4).
    *   The output is a significantly larger grid, also square.
    *   The output grid appears to be composed of multiple smaller blocks or tiles arranged in a larger grid structure.
    *   The size of these tiles seems to match the size of the original input grid.
    *   Some tiles in the output grid are exact copies of the input grid.
    *   Other tiles are uniformly filled with the white color (0).
    *   The arrangement of the input-copy tiles and the white tiles forms a pattern. The dimensions of this pattern grid match the dimensions of the original input grid.
    *   Comparing the input grid's pixel colors to the pattern of tiles in the output suggests a direct relationship: the color of a pixel at `(r, c)` in the input determines whether the tile at `(r, c)` in the output's meta-grid is a copy of the input or a white block.
    *   Specifically, observing across examples, it appears that if the input pixel is gray (5), the corresponding tile in the output is a copy of the input. If the input pixel is white (0) or any other non-gray color (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9), the corresponding tile is a white block.

    task_elements:
      - object: InputGrid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
          - colors: 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green), 4 (yellow), 5 (gray), 6 (magenta), 7 (orange), 8 (azure), 9 (maroon)
          - dimensions: H rows, W columns (square in examples, H=W=N)
      - object: OutputGrid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
          - dimensions: (H*H) rows, (W*W) columns
          - structure: Composed of an HxW arrangement of tiles.
      - object: Tile
        properties:
          - dimensions: H rows, W columns (same as InputGrid)
          - types:
              - InputCopyTile: An exact copy of the InputGrid.
              - WhiteTile: A tile filled entirely with white pixels (0).
      - object: PatternGrid (Conceptual)
        properties:
          - dimensions: H rows, W columns
          - values: 'I' (representing InputCopyTile) or 'W' (representing WhiteTile)
    relationships:
      - relation: OutputGrid size depends on InputGrid size.
        details: Output dimensions are (H*H) x (W*W).
      - relation: OutputGrid structure is a tiling.
        details: Output is an HxW grid of Tiles, each of size HxW.
      - relation: Tile type determination.
        details: The type of Tile at position (r_tile, c_tile) in the OutputGrid's tiling depends on the pixel color at InputGrid[r_tile][c_tile].
    actions:
      - action: Generate PatternGrid from InputGrid
        rule: For each pixel InputGrid[r][c], PatternGrid[r][c] = 'I' if InputGrid[r][c] is gray (5), otherwise PatternGrid[r][c] = 'W'.
      - action: Construct OutputGrid using PatternGrid and InputGrid
        rule: Iterate through r_tile from 0 to H-1 and c_tile from 0 to W-1. If PatternGrid[r_tile][c_tile] is 'I', place an InputCopyTile at the corresponding block in OutputGrid. If 'W', place a WhiteTile.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Let the input grid be `Input` with height `H` and width `W`.
    2.  Create a new output grid `Output` with dimensions `(H * H)` rows and `(W * W)` columns.
    3.  Determine the pattern for tiling: For each row `r` from 0 to `H-1` and each column `c` from 0 to `W-1`:
        a.  Examine the color of the pixel `Input[r][c]`.
        b.  If the color is gray (5), mark the corresponding position `(r, c)` in the pattern as requiring a copy of the `Input` grid.
        c.  If the color is white (0) or any color other than gray (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9), mark the corresponding position `(r, c)` in the pattern as requiring a white block.
    4.  Construct the `Output` grid: Iterate through each row `r_tile` from 0 to `H-1` and each column `c_tile` from 0 to `W-1`:
        a.  Define the target block in the `Output` grid: rows from `r_tile * H` to `(r_tile + 1) * H - 1`, and columns from `c_tile * W` to `(c_tile + 1) * W - 1`.
        b.  If the pattern mark for `(r_tile, c_tile)` requires a copy of the `Input` grid: Copy the entire `Input` grid into this target block in the `Output` grid.
        c.  If the pattern mark for `(r_tile, c_tile)` requires a white block: Fill this target block in the `Output` grid entirely with white pixels (0).
    5.  Return the completed `Output` grid.
