Identifying the four distinct red objects in the input grid.\n2. Determining the relative quadrant (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) of each object within the input grid based on the center of its bounding box.\n3. Creating a 7x7 output grid initialized with white (0).\n4. Placing each identified red object into the corresponding 3x3 quadrant of the output grid (Top-Left object -> rows 0-2, cols 0-2; Top-Right -> rows 0-2, cols 4-6; Bottom-Left -> rows 4-6, cols 0-2; Bottom-Right -> rows 4-6, cols 4-6). The central row (3) and column (3) of the output remain white.\n5. The internal structure (pattern of red pixels) of each object is preserved and copied relative to the top-left corner of its target quadrant.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds all connected components of a given color in the grid.\"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and not visited[r, c]:\n                obj_pixels = []\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                min_r, min_c = r, c\n                max_r, max_c = r, c\n\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    obj_pixels.append((row, col))\n                    min_r = min(min_r, row)\n                    min_c = min(min_c, col)\n                    max_r = max(max_r, row)\n                    max_c = max(max_c, col)\n\n                    # Check neighbors (4-connectivity)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                \n                # Store the object's pixels and its bounding box\n                objects.append({\n                    'pixels': obj_pixels,\n                    'bbox': (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)\n                })\n    return objects\n\ndef _get_relative_quadrant(obj_bbox, grid_shape):\n    \"\"\"Determines the quadrant of an object based on its bounding box center.\"\"\"\n    min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c = obj_bbox\n    grid_h, grid_w = grid_shape\n\n    # Calculate centers\n    obj_center_r = (min_r + max_r) / 2.0\n    obj_center_c = (min_c + max_c) / 2.0\n    grid_center_r = (grid_h - 1) / 2.0\n    grid_center_c = (grid_w - 1) / 2.0\n\n    is_top = obj_center_r <= grid_center_r\n    is_left = obj_center_c <= grid_center_c\n\n    if is_top and is_left:\n        return \"TL\"\n    elif is_top and not is_left:\n        return \"TR\"\n    elif not is_top and is_left:\n        return \"BL\"\n    else: # not is_top and not is_left\n        return \"BR\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the described rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid_list, dtype=int)\n    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape\n    \n    # Define the output grid size and initialize it\n    output_size = 7\n    output_grid = np.zeros((output_size, output_size), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Define the target quadrant top-left corners\n    target_quadrants = {\n        \"TL\": (0, 0),\n        \"TR\": (0, 4),\n        \"BL\": (4, 0),\n        \"BR\": (4, 4)\n    }\n\n    # Find all red objects in the input grid\n    red_color = 2\n    objects = _find_objects(input_grid, red_color)\n\n    # Process each object\n    for obj in objects:\n        obj_pixels = obj['pixels']\n        obj_bbox = obj['bbox']\n        min_r, min_c, _, _ = obj_bbox\n\n        # Determine the object's relative quadrant in the input grid\n        quadrant = _get_relative_quadrant(obj_bbox, input_grid.shape)\n\n        # Get the top-left corner for the target quadrant in the output grid\n        target_r_start, target_c_start = target_quadrants[quadrant]\n\n        # Place the object's pixels into the target quadrant\n        for r, c in obj_pixels:\n            # Calculate relative position within the object's bounding box\n            rel_r = r - min_r\n            rel_c = c - min_c\n            \n            # Calculate absolute position in the output grid\n            output_r = target_r_start + rel_r\n            output_c = target_c_start + rel_c\n\n            # Ensure the pixel is within the 3x3 quadrant bounds\n            # (This also handles objects smaller than 3x3)\n            if 0 <= rel_r < 3 and 0 <= rel_c < 3:\n                 # Check bounds just in case, though quadrant mapping should prevent out-of-bounds\n                 if 0 <= output_r < output_size and 0 <= output_c < output_size:\n                    output_grid[output_r, output_c] = red_color\n            else:\n                # This case implies an object larger than 3x3, which isn't expected based on examples\n                # but good to be aware of potential edge cases.\n                # For this task, we assume objects fit within 3x3 relative to their top-left.\n                pass\n\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
