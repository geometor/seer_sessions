Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids vary in size but always contain a white background (color 0) with scattered red pixels (color 2).
2.  **Red Objects:** The red pixels form distinct, non-contiguous shapes or objects. In all examples, there are exactly four such red objects.
3.  **Object Location:** These four red objects appear to be spatially separated, generally occupying different regions or "quadrants" of the input grid.
4.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is consistently a 7x7 grid. It also features a white background with red pixels.
5.  **Output Structure:** The output grid seems structured like a 2x2 arrangement of smaller grids, separated by a central white cross (the middle row and middle column are always white). The four red objects from the input appear to be placed into the four 3x3 corner regions of this 7x7 grid.
6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the four red objects in the input, determining their relative positions (e.g., top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), and then placing each object into the corresponding 3x3 quadrant in the fixed 7x7 output grid structure. The internal structure of each red object is preserved.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  description: Rearrange distinct shapes found in the input grid into a structured output grid.
  grid_properties:
    - input_size: variable

    description: Place the pixels of the red_object into the corresponding 3x3 quadrant of the output grid (Top-Left -> rows 0-2, cols 0-2; Top-Right -> rows 0-2, cols 4-6; Bottom-Left -> rows 4-6, cols 0-2; Bottom-Right -> rows 4-6, cols 4-6), preserving the object's internal structure relative to its top-left corner.
relationships:
  - relation: mapping
    from: input red_object location (quadrant)
    to: output 3x3 quadrant location
    description: The relative position of an object in the input determines its placement quadrant in the output.
  - relation: preservation
    element: red_object
    property: internal structure (pixel pattern)
    description: The shape of each red object is copied exactly from input to output.
output_structure:
  - grid_size: 7x7
  - layout: 2x2 arrangement of 3x3 quadrants separated by a central white cross (row 3 and column 3 are white).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize a new 7x7 grid, `output_grid`, filled with the background color white (0).
2.  Identify all distinct connected objects composed of red (2) pixels in the `input_grid`. There will be exactly four such objects.
3.  For each identified red object:
    a.  Determine the minimal bounding box containing the object.
    b.  Calculate the center coordinates of this bounding box.
    c.  Determine the center coordinates of the `input_grid`.
    d.  Compare the object's bounding box center to the `input_grid` center to classify the object's relative location as Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, or Bottom-Right.
    e.  Extract the pattern of red pixels within the object's bounding box, maintaining their positions relative to the top-left corner of the bounding box.
    f.  Select the target 3x3 quadrant in the `output_grid` based on the object's classified location:
        *   Top-Left location maps to rows 0-2, columns 0-2.
        *   Top-Right location maps to rows 0-2, columns 4-6.
        *   Bottom-Left location maps to rows 4-6, columns 0-2.
        *   Bottom-Right location maps to rows 4-6, columns 4-6.
    g.  Copy the extracted red pixel pattern into the selected target quadrant of the `output_grid`, aligning the top-left of the pattern with the top-left corner of the quadrant.
4.  Return the final `output_grid`.
