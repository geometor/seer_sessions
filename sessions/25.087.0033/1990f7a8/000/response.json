            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids vary in size but always contain a white background (color 0) with scattered red pixels (color 2).\n2.  **Red Objects:** The red pixels form distinct, non-contiguous shapes or objects. In all examples, there are exactly four such red objects.\n3.  **Object Location:** These four red objects appear to be spatially separated, generally occupying different regions or \"quadrants\" of the input grid.\n4.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is consistently a 7x7 grid. It also features a white background with red pixels.\n5.  **Output Structure:** The output grid seems structured like a 2x2 arrangement of smaller grids, separated by a central white cross (the middle row and middle column are always white). The four red objects from the input appear to be placed into the four 3x3 corner regions of this 7x7 grid.\n6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the four red objects in the input, determining their relative positions (e.g., top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), and then placing each object into the corresponding 3x3 quadrant in the fixed 7x7 output grid structure. The internal structure of each red object is preserved.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
