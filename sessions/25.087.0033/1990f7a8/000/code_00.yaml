task_context:
  description: Rearrange distinct shapes found in the input grid into a structured output grid.
  grid_properties:
    - input_size: variable
    - output_size: fixed (7x7)
    - background_color: white (0)
    - object_color: red (2)
elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    role: provides the canvas for objects
  - element: red_object
    color: red (2)
    description: Contiguous shapes made of red pixels.
    properties:
      - count: always 4 per input grid
      - structure: variable shapes, each fitting within a 3x3 bounding box
      - location: spatially separated, generally one per relative quadrant of the input grid
actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    input: input_grid
    output: list of red_objects (coordinates and structure)
    description: Find all connected components of red pixels.
  - action: determine_relative_location
    input: red_object, input_grid_dimensions
    output: quadrant (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right)
    description: Determine the relative quadrant of the input grid where the object's center lies.
  - action: create_output_canvas
    output: 7x7 grid initialized to white (0)
    description: Prepare the fixed-size output grid.
  - action: place_objects
    input: red_object, object_quadrant, output_canvas
    output: modified output_canvas
    description: Place the pixels of the red_object into the corresponding 3x3 quadrant of the output grid (Top-Left -> rows 0-2, cols 0-2; Top-Right -> rows 0-2, cols 4-6; Bottom-Left -> rows 4-6, cols 0-2; Bottom-Right -> rows 4-6, cols 4-6), preserving the object's internal structure relative to its top-left corner.
relationships:
  - relation: mapping
    from: input red_object location (quadrant)
    to: output 3x3 quadrant location
    description: The relative position of an object in the input determines its placement quadrant in the output.
  - relation: preservation
    element: red_object
    property: internal structure (pixel pattern)
    description: The shape of each red object is copied exactly from input to output.
output_structure:
  - grid_size: 7x7
  - layout: 2x2 arrangement of 3x3 quadrants separated by a central white cross (row 3 and column 3 are white).
