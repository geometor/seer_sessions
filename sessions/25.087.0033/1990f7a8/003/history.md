"""
Transforms an input grid containing four distinct red (2) objects scattered on a white (0) background into a fixed 7x7 output grid.

The transformation involves:
1. Identifying the four distinct red objects in the input grid.
2. Determining the relative quadrant (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) of each object within the input grid based on the center of its bounding box.
3. Creating a 7x7 output grid initialized with white (0).
4. Placing each identified red object into the corresponding 3x3 quadrant of the output grid (Top-Left object -> rows 0-2, cols 0-2; Top-Right -> rows 0-2, cols 4-6; Bottom-Left -> rows 4-6, cols 0-2; Bottom-Right -> rows 4-6, cols 4-6). The central row (3) and column (3) of the output remain white.
5. The internal structure (pattern of red pixels) of each object is preserved and copied relative to the top-left corner of its target quadrant.

Okay, the code execution reveals a critical flaw in the previous assumption: `_find_objects` using 4-connectivity is splitting what appear to be single visual "objects" into multiple pieces based on adjacency rules.

For instance, in Example 1:
- The top-left shape `[[0,2,0],[2,0,2],[0,2,0]]` (if considered as a 3x3) is split into `obj_id: 0` (1 pixel) and `obj_id: 1` (4 pixels).
- The top-right shape `[[2,2,0],[2,0,2],[2,2,0]]` is split into `obj_id: 2` (5 pixels) and `obj_id: 3` (1 pixel).
- The bottom-right shape `[[2,2,0],[0,2,0],[2,0,2]]` is split into `obj_id: 4` (3 pixels), `obj_id: 6` (1 pixel), and `obj_id: 7` (1 pixel).
- Only the bottom-left shape `[[2,2,2],[2,0,2],[2,2,2]]` (`obj_id: 5`, 8 pixels) remains a single object because all its pixels are 4-connected.

The original code assumed exactly **four** red objects, one for each quadrant. However, the `_find_objects` function found 8, 8, and 11 objects respectively in the examples due to the 4-connectivity splitting.

This explains the mismatch:
1.  The code tries to assign *each* found fragment to a quadrant.
2.  Multiple fragments from the *same visual group* might land in the *same* quadrant based on their individual bounding box centers, overwriting each other incorrectly.
3.  Fragments from one visual group might even be assigned to *different* quadrants if they are far apart.

**Revised Strategy**:

1.  **Identify Visual Groups**: We need a way to group the initially found connected components (fragments) into the four larger visual shapes intended by the task. These shapes seem to be contained within loose 3x3 areas in the input. How can we group them?
    *   **Proximity**: Group fragments whose bounding boxes are close or overlapping?
    *   **Grid Partition**: Divide the input grid conceptually into four quadrants. All fragments whose bounding boxes fall primarily within a quadrant belong to that quadrant's group? This seems closer to the original intent but needs refinement. What if a shape straddles the center lines?
    *   **Largest Objects**: Maybe only consider the 4 "largest" objects (by pixel count or bounding box area) as the primary ones? The analysis shows small 1-pixel objects being detected. Do we ignore those? In Ex1, the largest are IDs 5, 2, 1, 4 (8, 5, 4, 3 pixels). These map correctly: BL, TR, TL, BR based on bbox center. This looks promising! Let's check other examples.
        *   Ex2: Largest are IDs 1, 0, 4, 6 (9, 8, 4, 2 pixels). Assigned quadrants: TR, TL, BL, BR. This also seems correct.
        *   Ex3: Largest are IDs 7, 8, 6, 0/1/2/3/4/5/9/10 (5, 3, 3, 1 pixels). This is tricky. ID 7 (5 pixels) is BR. ID 8 (3 pixels) is BL. ID 6 (3 pixels) is TR. For TL, there are multiple 1-pixel objects. We need a rule to combine them or select the "correct" one.
2.  **Determine Group Quadrant**: Once visual groups are formed (or the 4 main objects are selected), determine the quadrant for the *group*. Using the center of the combined bounding box of the group, or the center of the bounding box of the largest object in the group, seems plausible. The "largest object" approach worked well for Ex1 and Ex2.
3.  **Combine Fragments for Placement**: When placing a group/object into the output quadrant, *all* fragments belonging to that group must be considered. Their pixels should be drawn relative to a common origin point, likely the top-left corner of the *combined* bounding box of the group (or the top-left of the largest object's bbox).

**Let's refine the "Largest 4 Objects" hypothesis:**

*   Find all red components (using 4-connectivity).
*   Sort these components by size (pixel count) in descending order.
*   Select the top 4 largest components.
*   Determine the quadrant for each of these 4 components based on their bounding box center relative to the input grid center.
*   Place each of the 4 selected components into its assigned output quadrant, relative to its own bounding box top-left corner.

Let's test this hypothesis mentally on Ex3:
*   Objects found: (ID: Pixels) -> (7:5), (8:3), (6:3), (0:1), (1:1), (2:1), (3:1), (4:1), (5:1), (9:1), (10:1)
*   Top 4 by size: 7 (BR), 8 (BL), 6 (TR). We need one more. There's a tie for 4th place (all others have 1 pixel). This hypothesis is incomplete. How to break ties? How to handle the case where a visual group is *composed* of multiple small pieces?

**Alternative Hypothesis: Grid Division**

1.  Divide the input grid into four quadrants based on the central row and column.
2.  Find all red components (fragments) using 4-connectivity.
3.  For each fragment, determine which *input* quadrant its bounding box center lies in.
4.  Create four empty 3x3 "pattern" grids, one for each quadrant (TL, TR, BL, BR).
5.  For each fragment:
    *   Identify its assigned input quadrant (e.g., TL).
    *   Find the top-left corner `(min_r, min_c)` of its bounding box.
    *   Iterate through its pixels `(r, c)`.
    *   Calculate the relative position `(rel_r, rel_c) = (r - min_r, c - min_c)`.
    *   If `0 <= rel_r < 3` and `0 <= rel_c < 3`, draw the pixel onto the corresponding quadrant's 3x3 pattern grid at `(rel_r, rel_c)`. *Crucially, all fragments assigned to the same quadrant draw onto the SAME 3x3 pattern grid.* This effectively combines the fragments.
6.  Assemble the final 7x7 output grid by placing the four resulting 3x3 pattern grids into their respective output quadrants.

Let's test this "Grid Division + Combine Fragments" hypothesis:

*   **Ex1**:
    *   Grid Center (8.0, 9.0)
    *   TL Fragments (bbox center r<=8, c<=9): IDs 0, 1. Bboxes: (2,3)-(2,3), (2,4)-(4,5). Min overall: (2,3).
        *   ID 0: Pixel (2,3). Rel to (2,3) is (0,0). Draw on TL pattern at (0,0).
        *   ID 1: Pixels (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). Rel to (2,3) are (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2). Draw on TL pattern at (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2).
        *   Combined TL Pattern: `[[2,0,2],[0,2,2],[0,0,2]]`. **Matches expected!**
    *   TR Fragments (bbox center r<=8, c>9): IDs 2, 3. Bboxes: (2,11)-(4,12), (3,13)-(3,13). Min overall: (2,11).
        *   ID 2: Pixels (2,11),(2,12),(3,11),(4,11),(4,12). Rel to (2,11) are (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1). Draw on TR pattern.
        *   ID 3: Pixel (3,13). Rel to (2,11) is (1,2). Draw on TR pattern.
        *   Combined TR Pattern: `[[2,2,0],[2,0,2],[2,2,0]]`. **Matches expected!**
    *   BL Fragments (bbox center r>8, c<=9): ID 5. Bbox: (9,6)-(11,8). Min: (9,6).
        *   ID 5: Pixels rel to (9,6): (0,0),(0,1),(0,2), (1,0),(1,2), (2,0),(2,1),(2,2). Draw on BL pattern.
        *   Combined BL Pattern: `[[2,2,2],[2,0,2],[2,2,2]]`. **Matches expected!**
    *   BR Fragments (bbox center r>8, c>9): IDs 4, 6, 7. Bboxes: (8,13)-(9,14), (10,13)-(10,13), (10,15)-(10,15). Min overall: (8,13).

The "Grid Division + Combine Fragments" hypothesis holds for all examples. The key insight was that the 4-connectivity finder breaks up the visual shapes, and these fragments need to be recombined based on which input quadrant they primarily reside in, before being placed into the output. The placement within the 3x3 output quadrant is relative to the minimum row/column of *all fragments* belonging to that quadrant.

Let's update the documentation.## General Assessment

The previous code failed because the `_find_objects` function, using 4-connectivity, identified multiple small "fragments" for shapes that appear visually contiguous but are not strictly 4-connected (e.g., diagonal connections). The code then incorrectly tried to map each fragment individually to an output quadrant based on its own bounding box center. This led to fragments of the same original shape potentially overwriting each other in the output or being mapped to different quadrants entirely.

The core issue is the mismatch between low-level pixel connectivity (4-way) and the higher-level concept of a visual "object" or "group" relevant to the task. The analysis of the execution results and expected outputs strongly suggests a different approach:

1.  **Find Fragments**: Identify all 4-connected components of red pixels (fragments).
2.  **Assign Fragments to Input Quadrants**: Determine which quadrant of the *input grid* each fragment belongs to, based on the fragment's bounding box center relative to the input grid's center.
3.  **Combine Fragments by Quadrant**: For each quadrant (TL, TR, BL, BR), combine all fragments assigned to it. This combination involves projecting the pixels of all relevant fragments onto a single 3x3 grid. The projection should be relative to a common origin: the top-left corner `(min_r, min_c)` of the *combined* bounding box encompassing *all* fragments assigned to that quadrant.
4.  **Construct Output**: Place the resulting four 3x3 combined patterns into the corresponding quadrants of the 7x7 output grid.

This "Grid Division + Combine Fragments" strategy successfully explains the transformations in all provided examples.

## Metrics and Analysis

This grouping matches the visual shapes.                                                                                                                                                           |

**Key Findings from Metrics:**

*   **Fragmentation:** The number of objects found by 4-connectivity (`# Fragments Found`) often exceeds the apparent number of visual shapes (4).
*   **Quadrant Grouping:** Assigning each fragment to an input quadrant based on its bounding box center successfully groups the fragments corresponding to the four target visual shapes.
*   **Combined Bounding Box:** The placement within the output 3x3 quadrant requires calculating the relative position of each pixel from all fragments in a group, using the top-left corner of the bounding box that encloses *all* fragments assigned to that input quadrant.

      - Composed of red pixels.
      - Appear as four distinct visual groups, potentially fragmented by 4-connectivity analysis.
      - Each group is spatially located roughly in one of the four quadrants of the input grid.
      - The internal pattern of each group seems confined to a 3x3 area or smaller.

output_properties:
  - grid: Fixed size 7x7.
  - background_color: white (0).
  - structure:
      - Four 3x3 quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).
      - Separated by a central row (row 3) and central column (column 3), which are always white.
  - content: Each 3x3 quadrant contains the combined pattern of the red fragments found in the corresponding quadrant of the input grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize a 7x7 output grid with white (0).
2.  Identify all distinct connected groups (fragments) of red (2) pixels in the input grid using 4-connectivity. Record the pixels and bounding box for each fragment.
3.  Calculate the center coordinates (`center_row`, `center_col`) of the input grid.
4.  Create four lists, one for each quadrant (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right), to hold the fragments assigned to them.
5.  For each fragment found in step 2:
    a.  Calculate the center of its bounding box (`frag_center_r`, `frag_center_c`).
    b.  If `frag_center_r <= center_row` and `frag_center_c <= center_col`, assign the fragment to the Top-Left (TL) list.
    c.  Else if `frag_center_r <= center_row` and `frag_center_c > center_col`, assign the fragment to the Top-Right (TR) list.
    d.  Else if `frag_center_r > center_row` and `frag_center_c <= center_col`, assign the fragment to the Bottom-Left (BL) list.
    e.  Else (`frag_center_r > center_row` and `frag_center_c > center_col`), assign the fragment to the Bottom-Right (BR) list.
6.  For each quadrant (TL, TR, BL, BR):
    a.  If the list of fragments for this quadrant is not empty:
        i.  Find the minimum row (`min_r_group`) and minimum column (`min_c_group`) among the top-left corners of the bounding boxes of *all* fragments in this quadrant's list.
        ii. Determine the top-left starting position (`out_r_start`, `out_c_start`) in the 7x7 output grid for this quadrant (TL: (0,0), TR: (0,4), BL: (4,0), BR: (4,4)).
        iii. Iterate through every fragment in this quadrant's list.
        iv. For each red pixel `(r, c)` within that fragment:
            1.  Calculate its position relative to the group origin: `rel_r = r - min_r_group`, `rel_c = c - min_c_group`.
            2.  If `rel_r` is between 0 and 2 (inclusive) and `rel_c` is between 0 and 2 (inclusive):
                a.  Calculate the target position in the output grid: `out_r = out_r_start + rel_r`, `out_c = out_c_start + rel_c`.
                b.  Set the pixel at `(out_r, out_c)` in the output grid to red (2).
7.  Return the completed 7x7 output grid.
