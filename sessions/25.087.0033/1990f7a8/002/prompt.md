"""
Transforms an input grid containing four distinct red (2) objects scattered on a white (0) background into a fixed 7x7 output grid.

The transformation involves:
1. Identifying the four distinct red objects in the input grid.
2. Determining the relative quadrant (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) of each object within the input grid based on the center of its bounding box.
3. Creating a 7x7 output grid initialized with white (0).
4. Placing each identified red object into the corresponding 3x3 quadrant of the output grid (Top-Left object -> rows 0-2, cols 0-2; Top-Right -> rows 0-2, cols 4-6; Bottom-Left -> rows 4-6, cols 0-2; Bottom-Right -> rows 4-6, cols 4-6). The central row (3) and column (3) of the output remain white.
5. The internal structure (pattern of red pixels) of each object is preserved and copied relative to the top-left corner of its target quadrant.
