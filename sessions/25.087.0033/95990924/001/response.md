"""
Identifies all 2x2 gray squares in the input grid. For each identified square, 
adds four new pixels diagonally adjacent to its corners: blue (1) top-left, 
red (2) top-right, green (3) bottom-left, and yellow (4) bottom-right, 
provided these positions are within the grid boundaries. The original grid elements, 
including the gray squares, are preserved.
