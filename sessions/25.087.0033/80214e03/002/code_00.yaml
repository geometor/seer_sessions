task_context:
  problem_description: Transform an input grid containing colored shapes into a smaller output grid representing sequences of colors.
  input_grid_properties:
    - Contains non-contiguous colored shapes (objects) on a white background (0).
    - Shapes can be complex and contain holes.
    - Objects are grouped conceptually into horizontal rows based on vertical overlap.
  output_grid_properties:
    - Represents sequences of colors derived from the input rows.
    - Output grid height equals the number of conceptual rows identified in the input.
    - Output grid width is determined by the maximum length of the unique color sequences found across all rows.
    - Each row in the output grid corresponds to a conceptual row in the input.

transformation_steps:
  - step: Identify all contiguous, non-white objects in the input grid.
    details: Record each object's color and pixel coordinates.
  - step: Group objects into conceptual rows.
    details: Objects belong to the same row if their vertical spans (min_row to max_row) overlap. Rows are ordered top-to-bottom based on their appearance.
  - step: Determine the unique color sequence for each row.
    details: Within each row group, identify the unique colors present. Order these unique colors based on the minimum column index (leftmost appearance) of any object of that color within the group.
  - step: Calculate the maximum sequence length.
    details: Find the maximum number of unique colors found in any single row (`max_width`).
  - step: Generate output rows.
    details: For each conceptual row:
      - Get the ordered sequence of unique colors.
      - Reverse this sequence.
      - Let the current reversed sequence length be `current_width`.
      - If `current_width < max_width`, pad the sequence at the *beginning* (left) with `(max_width - current_width)` copies of the *first* color in the reversed sequence (which corresponds to the rightmost unique color in the original sequence).
      - This padded or original reversed sequence forms a row in the output grid.
  - step: Construct the output grid.
    details: Assemble the generated rows into the final output grid. The height is the number of conceptual rows, and the width is `max_width`.

derived_facts:
  - Multiple objects of the same color within a conceptual row should only contribute their color *once* to the row's unique color sequence.
  - The horizontal order of unique colors is determined by the first (leftmost) occurrence of that color within the row's vertical span.
  - Padding uses the color of the rightmost unique object from the input row.
