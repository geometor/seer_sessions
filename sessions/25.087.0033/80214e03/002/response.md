## General Assessment

The provided Python code successfully solves the first two examples but fails on the third. The failure mode in Example 3 indicates an incorrect output grid width and incorrect padding. The actual output `[2, 2, 2, 3, 4]` and `[6, 8, 1, 1, 1]` compared to the expected `[2, 3, 4]` and `[6, 8, 1]` suggests that the code might be counting multiple objects of the *same color* within a conceptual row, leading to an inflated `max_width` and incorrect padding based on this inflated width.

The core logic seems to involve identifying horizontal groupings of objects, extracting their colors in left-to-right order, reversing this order, and arranging these reversed color sequences into the output grid, possibly with padding.

The strategy to resolve this involves refining the definition of a "row" and how colors are extracted and counted within that row. Instead of counting every distinct object, the transformation likely considers the sequence of *unique* colors encountered horizontally within a vertically defined band.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the object detection and grouping for Example 3 using the provided code's functions to understand the discrepancy.

## Analysis of Metrics

The metrics reveal the exact source of the error in Example 3:

1.  **Object Grouping:** The `group_objects_by_row` correctly identifies 2 conceptual rows based on vertical overlap.
2.  **Color Extraction:**
    *   Row 0 (Top): The code extracts `[4, 3, 2]` as the colors, corresponding to the Yellow, Green, and Red objects found. This appears correct based on left-to-right order. The number of objects is 3.
    *   Row 1 (Bottom): The code extracts `[1, 1, 1, 8, 6]` as the colors. This indicates it found *three* distinct Blue (1) objects, *one* Azure (8) object, and *one* Magenta (6) object that vertically overlap and are sorted left-to-right. The number of objects is 5.
3.  **Max Width Calculation:** The code calculates `max_width` based on the *number of objects* in each row list. Row 0 has 3 objects, Row 1 has 5 objects. Therefore, `max_width` is 5.
4.  **Padding Issue:** The output dimension is determined by `max_width` (5), and padding is applied based on this width, leading to the incorrect output size and repeated padding values.
5.  **Discrepancy:** The expected output width is 3. This strongly suggests that the transformation should consider the sequence of *unique colors* within each row, not the sequence of all objects.
    *   Row 0 Unique Colors (left-to-right): [4, 3, 2]. Length 3.
    *   Row 1 Unique Colors (left-to-right): [1, 8, 6]. Length 3.
    *   The maximum length of unique color sequences is 3.

## YAML Fact Sheet


```yaml
task_context:
  problem_description: Transform an input grid containing colored shapes into a smaller output grid representing sequences of colors.
  input_grid_properties:
    - Contains non-contiguous colored shapes (objects) on a white background (0).
    - Shapes can be complex and contain holes.
    - Objects are grouped conceptually into horizontal rows based on vertical overlap.
  output_grid_properties:
    - Represents sequences of colors derived from the input rows.
    - Output grid height equals the number of conceptual rows identified in the input.
    - Output grid width is determined by the maximum length of the unique color sequences found across all rows.
    - Each row in the output grid corresponds to a conceptual row in the input.

transformation_steps:
  - step: Identify all contiguous, non-white objects in the input grid.
    details: Record each object's color and pixel coordinates.
  - step: Group objects into conceptual rows.
    details: Objects belong to the same row if their vertical spans (min_row to max_row) overlap. Rows are ordered top-to-bottom based on their appearance.
  - step: Determine the unique color sequence for each row.
    details: Within each row group, identify the unique colors present. Order these unique colors based on the minimum column index (leftmost appearance) of any object of that color within the group.
  - step: Calculate the maximum sequence length.
    details: Find the maximum number of unique colors found in any single row (`max_width`).
  - step: Generate output rows.
    details: For each conceptual row:
      - Get the ordered sequence of unique colors.
      - Reverse this sequence.
      - Let the current reversed sequence length be `current_width`.
      - If `current_width < max_width`, pad the sequence at the *beginning* (left) with `(max_width - current_width)` copies of the *first* color in the reversed sequence (which corresponds to the rightmost unique color in the original sequence).
      - This padded or original reversed sequence forms a row in the output grid.
  - step: Construct the output grid.
    details: Assemble the generated rows into the final output grid. The height is the number of conceptual rows, and the width is `max_width`.

derived_facts:
  - Multiple objects of the same color within a conceptual row should only contribute their color *once* to the row's unique color sequence.
  - The horizontal order of unique colors is determined by the first (leftmost) occurrence of that color within the row's vertical span.
  - Padding uses the color of the rightmost unique object from the input row.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all distinct, contiguous, non-background colored objects in the input grid, noting their color and spatial extent (bounding box or pixels).
2.  Group these objects into conceptual horizontal rows based on vertical overlap: if any part of an object's vertical span overlaps with the vertical span of any object already in a row, it belongs to that row. Order these conceptual rows from top to bottom.
3.  For each conceptual row:
    a.  Find all unique colors present among the objects in that row.
    b.  Determine the horizontal order of these unique colors by finding the minimum column index (leftmost point) associated with each unique color within that row group. Create a sequence of these unique colors sorted by their leftmost appearance.
4.  Determine the maximum length (`max_width`) across all the unique color sequences generated in step 3b.
5.  Create an output grid with height equal to the number of conceptual rows and width equal to `max_width`.
6.  For each conceptual row (and its corresponding unique color sequence from step 3b), generate a row for the output grid:
    a.  Reverse the order of the unique color sequence.
    b.  If the length of the reversed sequence is less than `max_width`, prepend copies of the *first* color in the reversed sequence until the row's length equals `max_width`.
    c.  Place this final (potentially padded) reversed sequence into the corresponding row of the output grid.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
