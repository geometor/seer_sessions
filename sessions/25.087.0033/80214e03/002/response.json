            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code successfully solves the first two examples but fails on the third. The failure mode in Example 3 indicates an incorrect output grid width and incorrect padding. The actual output `[2, 2, 2, 3, 4]` and `[6, 8, 1, 1, 1]` compared to the expected `[2, 3, 4]` and `[6, 8, 1]` suggests that the code might be counting multiple objects of the *same color* within a conceptual row, leading to an inflated `max_width` and incorrect padding based on this inflated width.\n\nThe core logic seems to involve identifying horizontal groupings of objects, extracting their colors in left-to-right order, reversing this order, and arranging these reversed color sequences into the output grid, possibly with padding.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this involves refining the definition of a \"row\" and how colors are extracted and counted within that row. Instead of counting every distinct object, the transformation likely considers the sequence of *unique* colors encountered horizontally within a vertically defined band.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the object detection and grouping for Example 3 using the provided code's functions to understand the discrepancy.\n\n"

This appears correct based on left-to-right order. The number of objects is 3.\n    *   Row 1 (Bottom): The code extracts `[1, 1, 1, 8, 6]` as the colors. This indicates it found *three* distinct Blue (1) objects, *one* Azure (8) object, and *one* Magenta (6) object that vertically overlap and are sorted left-to-right. The number of objects is 5.\n3.  **Max Width Calculation:** The code calculates `max_width` based on the *number of objects* in each row list. Row 0 has 3 objects, Row 1 has 5 objects. Therefore, `max_width` is 5.\n4.  **Padding Issue:** The output dimension is determined by `max_width` (5), and padding is applied based on this width, leading to the incorrect output size and repeated padding values.\n5.  **Discrepancy:** The expected output width is 3.
