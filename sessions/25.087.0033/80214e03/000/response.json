            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input:** The input grids are relatively large and mostly white (color 0). They contain several distinct, solid-colored objects (shapes). These shapes can be irregular and sometimes contain internal holes (pixels of white color 0).\n2.  **Output:** The output grids are much smaller than the input grids. They contain colors that correspond to the colors of the shapes found in the input grid. The background color (white) is not present in the output.\n3.  **Arrangement:** In the input, the colored shapes appear to be roughly arranged in horizontal rows. For example, in `train_1`, there's a top row of shapes (green, red, azure), a middle set (red, yellow), and a bottom row (blue, magenta, green).\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grid seems to summarize the input grid's shapes row by row. The number of rows in the output matches the number of distinct horizontal \"layers\" or rows of shapes in the input. The number of columns in the output seems determined by the maximum number of shapes found in any single input row.\n5.  **Order:** Within each row of the output, the colors correspond to the shapes in the corresponding input row, but their horizontal order is reversed.\n6.  **Padding:** If an input row of shapes has fewer shapes than the maximum number found in any row, the corresponding output row is padded. The padding seems to involve repeating the color of the shape that was originally rightmost in the input row (which becomes the leftmost after reversal). This padding occurs at the beginning (left side) of the output row.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "```yaml\nObservations:\n  - Input grid contains multiple non-white objects (shapes) on a white background.\n  - Output grid is a smaller grid summarizing the input shapes.\n  - Shapes in the input are grouped into implicit horizontal rows based on vertical positioning and overlap.\n  - Each row in the output corresponds to one horizontal row of shapes from the input, ordered top-to-bottom.\n  - The colors in an output row are the colors of the shapes in the corresponding input row.\n  - The horizontal order of colors within each output row is the reverse of the horizontal order of the corresponding shapes in the input row (left-to-right becomes right-to-left).\n  - The width of the output grid is determined by the maximum number of shapes found in any single horizontal row in the input.\n  - Output rows derived from input rows with fewer shapes than the maximum are padded at the beginning (left side).\n  - The padding color used is the first color in the reversed sequence (which corresponds to the rightmost shape in the original input row).\n\nPriors Used:\n  - Objectness: Identifying contiguous blocks of color as distinct shapes. Recognizing properties like color and position (bounding box).\n  - Geometry/Topology: Using spatial relationships (above/below, left/right, overlap) to group shapes into rows and order them. Determining bounding boxes.\n  - Numbers/Counting: Counting shapes within rows to determine output width and padding requirements.\n```"

Determine the color and bounding box (minimum/maximum row and column) for each shape.\n2.  Group the identified shapes into horizontal \"rows\". Two shapes belong to the same row if their bounding boxes overlap vertically. Find all such groups and order them from top to bottom based on their minimum row index.\n3.  For each group (row) of shapes, sort the shapes horizontally from left to right based on their minimum column index. Create a list of the colors of the shapes in this sorted order for each row.\n4.  Determine the maximum number of shapes present in any single row (`max_width`). This value defines the width of the output grid. The number of rows identified in step 2 defines the height of the output grid.\n5.  Initialize an empty output grid with the determined height and `max_width`.\n6.  For each list of colors corresponding to an input row (ordered top-to-bottom):\n    a. Reverse the order of colors in the list.\n    b. Let the current length of the reversed list be `current_width`.\n    c. If `current_width < max_width`, determine the padding color, which is the first color in the reversed list. Prepend this padding color to the list `max_width - current_width` times.\n    d. Place this final list of colors as the next row in the output grid.\n7.  Return the completed output grid."
