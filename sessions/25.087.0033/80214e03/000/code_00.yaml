Observations:
  - Input grid contains multiple non-white objects (shapes) on a white background.
  - Output grid is a smaller grid summarizing the input shapes.
  - Shapes in the input are grouped into implicit horizontal rows based on vertical positioning and overlap.
  - Each row in the output corresponds to one horizontal row of shapes from the input, ordered top-to-bottom.
  - The colors in an output row are the colors of the shapes in the corresponding input row.
  - The horizontal order of colors within each output row is the reverse of the horizontal order of the corresponding shapes in the input row (left-to-right becomes right-to-left).
  - The width of the output grid is determined by the maximum number of shapes found in any single horizontal row in the input.
  - Output rows derived from input rows with fewer shapes than the maximum are padded at the beginning (left side).
  - The padding color used is the first color in the reversed sequence (which corresponds to the rightmost shape in the original input row).

Priors Used:
  - Objectness: Identifying contiguous blocks of color as distinct shapes. Recognizing properties like color and position (bounding box).
  - Geometry/Topology: Using spatial relationships (above/below, left/right, overlap) to group shapes into rows and order them. Determining bounding boxes.
  - Numbers/Counting: Counting shapes within rows to determine output width and padding requirements.
