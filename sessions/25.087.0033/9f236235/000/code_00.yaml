perception:
  - input_grid_structure:
      type: composite
      description: Input grid is divided by horizontal and vertical lines of a single color into a larger grid of smaller, equally sized square cells.
      properties:
        grid_line_color: Varies (azure '8' or red '2')
        background_color: white '0'
        conceptual_grid_dimensions: [N, N] (e.g., 4x4 or 3x3)
        cell_size: [S, S] (e.g., 4x4 or 3x3)
  - objects:
      type: list
      description: Solid square blocks of color found within some conceptual cells.
      items:
        - object_type: color_block
          properties:
            color: Varies (blue '1', red '2', green '3', yellow '4', azure '8')
            shape: square
            location: Resides within a specific conceptual cell (r, c) of the input's N x N structure.
            relation_to_cell: Occupies the area defined by the cell, excluding grid lines.
  - output_grid_structure:
      type: simple
      description: A single grid whose dimensions match the conceptual grid dimensions of the input.
      properties:
        dimensions: [N, N] (same N as input conceptual grid)
        background_color: white '0'
  - transformation:
      type: geometric
      description: Colors from input blocks are placed into the output grid based on reflecting the conceptual cell coordinates horizontally.
      rule: Map the color C from input conceptual cell (r, c) to output cell (r', c').
      mapping:
        r': r
        c': (N-1) - c
      preserves: Color of the block.
