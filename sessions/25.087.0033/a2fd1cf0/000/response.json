The positions of the red and green pixels vary across examples.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid retains the original red and green pixels in their exact locations. Additionally, a path of azure pixels (8) appears, connecting the red and green pixels.\n3.  **Path Formation:** The azure path follows a specific pattern: it forms an 'L' shape connecting the red and green pixels. The path consists of a horizontal segment and a vertical segment meeting at a corner.\n4.  **Path Segments:**\n    *   One segment runs horizontally along the row of the red pixel, starting from the column adjacent to the red pixel and extending to the column of the green pixel.\n    *   The other segment runs vertically along the column of the green pixel, starting from the row adjacent to the corner and extending to the row just before the green pixel.\n5.  **Corner Point:** The corner of the 'L' path consistently appears at the intersection of the red pixel's row and the green pixel's column.\n6.  **Exclusivity:** The path pixels (azure) replace only the background pixels (white). The original red and green pixels are never overwritten. The path includes all pixels along the 'L' shape *except* for the starting red and ending green pixels themselves.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Locate the coordinates (row `r1`, column `c1`) of the red pixel (2) in the input grid.\n3.  Locate the coordinates (row `r2`, column `c2`) of the green pixel (3) in the input grid.\n4.  Determine the coordinates of the corner point for the 'L' path: (`r1`, `c2`).\n5.  Identify the sequence of cells forming the horizontal segment of the path:\n    *   If `c1` < `c2`, the cells are (`r1`, `c`) for `c` from `c1 + 1` to `c2` (inclusive).\n    *   If `c1` > `c2`, the cells are (`r1`, `c`) for `c` from `c1 - 1` down to `c2` (inclusive).\n    *   If `c1` == `c2`, this segment is empty.\n6.  Identify the sequence of cells forming the vertical segment of the path:\n    *   If `r1` < `r2`, the cells are (`r`, `c2`) for `r` from `r1 + 1` to `r2 - 1` (inclusive).\n    *   If `r1` > `r2`, the cells are (`r`, `c2`) for `r` from `r1 - 1` down to `r2 + 1` (inclusive).\n    *   If `r1` == `r2`, this segment is empty.\n7.  Combine the cells from the horizontal segment, the vertical segment, and the corner point (`r1`, `c2`) if it wasn't already included in the horizontal segment (which happens if `c1 != c2`). This combined set represents all the coordinates for the azure path.\n8.  Iterate through the identified path coordinates. For each coordinate (`r`, `c`), change the color of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to azure (8). Ensure not to overwrite the original red (2) or green (3) pixels if they happen to coincide with a path coordinate (though the logic defined should prevent this).\n9.  Return the modified output grid."
