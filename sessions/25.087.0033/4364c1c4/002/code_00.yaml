task_context:
  description: Shifts pairs of vertically aligned objects horizontally in opposite directions.
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: The most frequent color, filling space not occupied by objects or vacated by shifts.
    - objects: Contiguous blocks of non-background colors.

objects:
  - object_pair:
      description: Two distinct objects where one is directly above the other, sharing one or more columns.
      properties:
        - upper_object: The object with smaller row indices in the shared columns.
        - lower_object: The object with larger row indices in the shared columns.
        - shared_columns: The set of column indices where both objects have pixels.

actions:
  - action: identify_background_color
    description: Determine the background color of the input grid (e.g., most frequent color).
  - action: find_objects
    description: Identify all connected components (objects) of non-background colors and their coordinates.
  - action: find_vertical_pairs
    description: Iterate through all pairs of objects to find those that are vertically aligned and share columns.
  - action: shift_upper_object_left
    condition: The object is the upper object in a vertical pair.
    effect: The object's pixels are moved one column to the left. Pixels originally in column 0 are removed.
  - action: shift_lower_object_right
    condition: The object is the lower object in a vertical pair.
    effect: The object's pixels are moved one column to the right. Pixels originally in the last column are removed.
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color. Place the shifted pixels of all identified upper and lower objects into the output grid.
