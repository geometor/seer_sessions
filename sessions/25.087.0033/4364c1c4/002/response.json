            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code implemented a simple horizontal shift left by one column for the entire grid content, filling the vacated column with the background color. This failed because the transformation is more nuanced. The errors (\"Pixels Off\") indicate that while some parts of the grid might shift left, other parts shift differently or not at all.\n\nThe analysis of the three examples reveals a pattern where pairs of objects, vertically aligned (sharing columns), undergo opposing horizontal shifts: the upper object shifts left by one column, and the lower object shifts right by one column. Objects outside these paired interactions seem unaffected (although all objects in the examples are part of such pairs). The background color remains static and fills any columns vacated by the shifts.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Identify distinct non-background objects.\n2.  Identify pairs of objects that are vertically aligned.\n3.  Apply a left shift of 1 to the upper object in each pair.\n4.  Apply a right shift of 1 to the lower object in each pair.\n5.  Construct the output grid based on these shifted object positions, using the background color for the remaining cells.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze each example based on the new hypothesis:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 12x12\n*   Background Color: Blue (1)\n*   Objects:\n    *   Obj A: Yellow (4), Rows 2-5, Cols 2-8\n    *   Obj B: Red (2), Rows 6-7, Cols 2-8\n*   Vertical Alignment: Yes, Obj A is above Obj B, sharing columns 2-8.\n*   Expected Shifts: Obj A (Yellow) shifts left by 1. Obj B (Red) shifts right by 1.\n*   Comparison with Expected Output:\n    *   Yellow shape moves from cols 2-8 to cols 1-7. Correct.\n    *   Red shape moves from cols 2-8 to cols 3-9. Correct.\n    *   Background (Blue) fills vacated areas (col 0 for Red shift, col 11 for Yellow shift). Correct.\n*   Previous Code Error (10 pixels off): The previous code shifted Red left instead of right. The difference is seen in columns 1, 2, 8, 9 of rows 6 and 7.\n    *   Expected: `... 1 1 1 2 ... 2 2 1 1 ...` (Cols 1, 2, 3, ... 8, 9, 10, 11)\n    *   Previous: `... 1 2 2 2 ... 2 1 1 1 ...` (Cols 1, 2, 3, ... 8, 9, 10, 11)\n    *   Difference at (6,1), (7,1), (6,3), (7,3), (6,9), (7,9), (6,10), (7,10), (6,11), (7,11). Yes, 10 pixels.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 16x12\n*   Background Color: Azure (8)\n*   Objects:\n    *   Obj A: Magenta (6), Rows 1-4, Cols 2-8\n    *   Obj B: Green (3), Rows 5-9, Cols 2-8\n*   Vertical Alignment: Yes, Obj A is above Obj B, sharing columns 2-8.\n*   Expected Shifts: Obj A (Magenta) shifts left by 1. Obj B (Green) shifts right by 1.\n*   Comparison with Expected Output:\n    *   Magenta shape moves from cols 2-8 to cols 1-7. Correct.\n    *   Green shape moves from cols 2-8 to cols 3-9. Correct.\n    *   Background (Azure) fills vacated areas. Correct.\n*   Previous Code Error (24 pixels off): The previous code shifted Green left instead of right. The difference involves columns 1, 2, 8, 9 for rows 5-9 (5 rows * 4 columns = 20 pixels) plus differences in the last column (4 pixels). Total 24 pixels.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 12x13\n*   Background Color: Green (3)\n*   Objects:\n    *   Obj A: Red (2), Row 2, Cols 7-9\n    *   Obj B: Orange (7), Row 3, Cols 7-9\n    *   Obj C: Azure (8), Rows 5-9, Cols 1-4\n    *   Obj D: Magenta (6), Rows 10-11, Cols 1-4\n*   Vertical Alignment:\n    *   Pair 1: Obj A (Red) is above Obj B (Orange), sharing columns 7-9.\n    *   Pair 2: Obj C (Azure) is above Obj D (Magenta), sharing columns 1-4.\n*   Expected Shifts: Obj A (Red) shifts left by 1. Obj B (Orange) shifts right by 1. Obj C (Azure) shifts left by 1. Obj D (Magenta) shifts right by 1.\n*   Comparison with Expected Output:\n    *   Red shape moves from cols 7-9 to cols 6-8. Correct.\n    *   Orange shape moves from cols 7-9 to cols 8-10. Correct.\n    *   Azure shape moves from cols 1-4 to cols 0-3. Correct.\n    *   Magenta shape moves from cols 1-4 to cols 2-5. Correct.\n    *   Background (Green) fills vacated areas. Correct.\n*   Previous Code Error (12 pixels off): The previous code shifted Orange and Magenta left instead of right.\n    *   Orange diff: cols 6, 7, 9, 10 in row 3 (4 pixels).\n    *   Magenta diff: cols 0, 1, 4, 5 in rows 10-11 (2 rows * 4 columns = 8 pixels).\n    *   Total 4 + 8 = 12 pixels.\n\nThe analysis confirms the hypothesis: vertically aligned object pairs shift in opposite horizontal directions (upper left, lower right).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
