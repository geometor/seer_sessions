The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), and gray (5).\n\nObserving the examples, the key transformation seems related to the red (2) pixels present *only* in the bottom row of the input grid. These red pixels act as triggers.\n\nSpecifically, if a column in the input grid has a red (2) pixel in its bottom-most cell, then all the white (0) pixels located *above* that bottom cell within the same column are changed to red (2) in the output grid.\n\nAll other pixels, including:\n*   Gray (5) pixels anywhere in the grid.\n*   White (0) pixels in columns *not* triggered by a red pixel in the bottom row.\n*   The entire bottom row of the grid (including the triggering red pixels).\nremain unchanged in the output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
