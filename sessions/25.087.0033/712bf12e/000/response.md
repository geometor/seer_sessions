**Perception**

The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid. Both grids have the same dimensions. The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), and gray (5).

Observing the examples, the key transformation seems related to the red (2) pixels present *only* in the bottom row of the input grid. These red pixels act as triggers.

Specifically, if a column in the input grid has a red (2) pixel in its bottom-most cell, then all the white (0) pixels located *above* that bottom cell within the same column are changed to red (2) in the output grid.

All other pixels, including:
*   Gray (5) pixels anywhere in the grid.
*   White (0) pixels in columns *not* triggered by a red pixel in the bottom row.
*   The entire bottom row of the grid (including the triggering red pixels).
remain unchanged in the output grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions_match_input_output: true
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0), red (2), gray (5)
  - type: row
    properties:
      - position: bottom (last row)
        role: trigger_source
  - type: column
    properties:
      - contains_trigger: if bottom pixel is red (2)

actions:
  - name: color_change
    conditions:
      - target_pixel_color: white (0)
      - target_pixel_location: not in bottom row
      - target_pixel_column: contains a red (2) pixel in the bottom row
    result:
      - target_pixel_color: becomes red (2)
  - name: no_change
    conditions:
      - pixel_color: gray (5)
      - pixel_location: any
    result:
      - pixel_color: remains gray (5)
  - name: no_change
    conditions:
      - pixel_location: in bottom row
      - pixel_color: any
    result:
      - pixel_color: remains unchanged
  - name: no_change
    conditions:
      - pixel_color: white (0)
      - pixel_location: not in bottom row
      - pixel_column: does NOT contain a red (2) pixel in the bottom row
    result:
      - pixel_color: remains white (0)

relationships:
  - type: vertical_alignment
    description: The transformation depends on the column alignment of pixels relative to the bottom row.
  - type: trigger
    source: red (2) pixel in the bottom row
    target: white (0) pixels in the same column (above the bottom row)
    action: causes color change from white (0) to red (2)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the columns in the input grid that contain a red (2) pixel in the bottom-most row.
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
3.  For each identified column (from step 1):
    a.  Iterate through all rows *except* the bottom row.
    b.  If the pixel at the current row and identified column is white (0), change its color to red (2) in the output grid copy.
4.  All other pixels in the output grid copy (gray pixels, pixels in the bottom row, and white pixels in columns *not* identified in step 1) retain their original colors from the input grid.
5.  The final modified grid copy is the output.
