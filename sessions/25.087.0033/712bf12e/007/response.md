def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid based on a flood fill originating from red pixels in the bottom row.

    1. Identify red pixels (value 2) in the bottom row ("triggers").
    2. Initialize a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from these trigger coordinates.
    3. The BFS explores 4-directionally (up, down, left, right).
    4. The BFS can only propagate into cells that are white (value 0) in the original input grid.
    5. Keep track of all visited cells (both triggers and reachable white cells).
    6. Create an output grid, initially a copy of the input grid.
    7. Iterate through all the cells visited by the BFS. If a visited cell was originally white (value 0) in the input grid, change its color to red (value 2) in the output grid.
    8. Cells not visited by the BFS, and cells that were visited but were not originally white (e.g., the trigger cells themselves), retain their original colors.
