## General Assessment

The provided Python code implements a flood fill algorithm originating from locations adjacent to red "trigger" pixels in the bottom row. However, the generated outputs incorrectly fill almost all available white space above the bottom row, whereas the expected outputs show more constrained filled areas.

The primary discrepancy appears to be in the identification of the initial starting points for the flood fill. The current code uses 8-way adjacency to find white pixels above the bottom row near triggers. The analysis of expected outputs suggests that the fill should only start from white pixels *directly above* (4-way adjacent) the trigger pixels.

Furthermore, the flood fill propagation seems correctly constrained in the code (4-way, blocked by non-white pixels and the bottom row), but the incorrect starting points lead to an over-extensive fill. The hypothesis is that correcting the start point identification to only include white pixels at `(trigger_row - 1, trigger_col)` will resolve the discrepancies.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's gather metrics for each example to compare the input, expected output, and the code's transformed output.
