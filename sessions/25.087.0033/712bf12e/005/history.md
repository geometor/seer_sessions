    Transforms the input grid by performing a constrained flood fill initiated by red pixels in the bottom row.

    1. Identify red pixels (value 2) in the bottom row ("triggers").
    2. Find all white pixels (value 0) located strictly above the bottom row that are 8-way adjacent to any trigger pixel. These are the starting points for the flood fill.
    3. Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) flood fill starting simultaneously from all these identified starting points.
    4. The fill propagates 4-directionally (up, down, left, right) only into other white pixels within the input grid.
    5. The fill propagation is constrained:
        - It cannot enter the bottom row (row index must be less than height - 1).
        - It is blocked by any non-white pixel (value != 0).
    6. All white pixels visited by this constrained flood fill (including the starting points) are changed to red (value 2) in the output grid.
    7. Pixels not visited by the fill, and pixels in the bottom row, retain their original colors from the input grid.

## General Assessment

The provided Python code implements a flood fill algorithm originating from locations adjacent to red "trigger" pixels in the bottom row. However, the generated outputs incorrectly fill almost all available white space above the bottom row, whereas the expected outputs show more constrained filled areas.

The primary discrepancy appears to be in the identification of the initial starting points for the flood fill. The current code uses 8-way adjacency to find white pixels above the bottom row near triggers. The analysis of expected outputs suggests that the fill should only start from white pixels *directly above* (4-way adjacent) the trigger pixels.

Furthermore, the flood fill propagation seems correctly constrained in the code (4-way, blocked by non-white pixels and the bottom row), but the incorrect starting points lead to an over-extensive fill. The hypothesis is that correcting the start point identification to only include white pixels at `(trigger_row - 1, trigger_col)` will resolve the discrepancies.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's gather metrics for each example to compare the input, expected output, and the code's transformed output.
