"""
Transforms the input grid based on column-wise sorting of specific colors relative to the top and bottom boundary rows.

1. Identify the Top Boundary Color (TBC) from the first row and the Bottom Boundary Color (BBC) from the last row.
2. Identify the Background Color (BGC) as the most frequent color between the first and last rows.
3. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions, initially filled with the BGC.
4. Copy the first (TBC) and last (BBC) rows from the input to the output grid.
5. For each column:
    a. Count the occurrences of TBC (`count_TBC`) and BBC (`count_BBC`) in the input column, excluding the boundary rows.
    b. In the output column, place `count_TBC` pixels of TBC color starting from the second row downwards.
    c. In the output column, place `count_BBC` pixels of BBC color starting from the second-to-last row upwards.
    d. Fill the remaining space in the column between the TBC stack and the BBC stack with the BGC.
6. Return the modified output grid.
