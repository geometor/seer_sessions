            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation process for this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of the same size (16x16 in the examples).\n2.  **Boundary Rows:** The top row (row 0) and the bottom row (last row) have distinct, uniform colors that are preserved in the output. Let's call the color of the top row the \"Top Boundary Color\" (TBC) and the color of the bottom row the \"Bottom Boundary Color\" (BBC). In example 1, TBC is maroon (9), BBC is azure (8). In example 2, TBC is red (2), BBC is gray (5).\n3.  **Background Color:** The area between the top and bottom boundary rows is predominantly filled with a single background color (BGC), which is orange (7) in both examples. Most BGC pixels remain unchanged in the output.\n4.  **Active Pixels:** Within the area between the boundaries, there are pixels matching the TBC and pixels matching the BBC. These are the \"active\" pixels that change position.\n5.  **Transformation by Column:** The transformation appears to happen independently within each column.\n6.  **Vertical Sorting/Stacking:**\n    *   Pixels matching the TBC within a column (excluding the top row) are collected. Their *count* is preserved, and they are stacked vertically in the output column starting from row 1 (just below the top boundary) and going downwards.\n    *   Pixels matching the BBC within a column (excluding the bottom row) are collected. Their *count* is preserved, and they are stacked vertically in the output column starting from the row just above the bottom boundary (row H-2) and going upwards.\n7.  **Filling the Gap:** Any space remaining in a column between the stacked TBC pixels (at the top) and the stacked BBC pixels (at the bottom) is filled with the BGC.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
