task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - size_preservation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
    - boundary_rows: Topmost (row 0) and bottommost (row H-1) rows act as fixed boundaries.
  colors:
    - top_boundary_color (TBC): Color found in row 0.
    - bottom_boundary_color (BBC): Color found in row H-1.
    - background_color (BGC): The most frequent color found between row 1 and row H-2 (inclusive).
    - active_colors: TBC and BBC when found between the boundary rows.
objects:
  - object: top_boundary
    description: The entire first row of the grid.
    properties:
      - color: TBC
      - fixed: Position and color remain unchanged.
  - object: bottom_boundary
    description: The entire last row of the grid.
    properties:
      - color: BBC
      - fixed: Position and color remain unchanged.
  - object: active_pixel
    description: A pixel located between the boundary rows (rows 1 to H-2) whose color matches either TBC or BBC.
    properties:
      - color: TBC or BBC
      - position: (row, column)
actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [TBC, BBC, BGC]
    description: Determine TBC from input[0][0], BBC from input[H-1][0], and BGC by frequency analysis between rows 1 and H-2.
  - action: process_columns
    inputs: [input_grid, TBC, BBC, BGC]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: Iterate through each column independently to rearrange active pixels.
    steps:
      - Initialize output grid (e.g., with BGC).
      - Copy top and bottom boundary rows from input to output.
      - For each column `c`:
          - Count active pixels: `num_top` (TBC color) and `num_bottom` (BBC color) between rows 1 and H-2.
          - Place `num_top` TBC pixels in output column `c`, starting at row 1 and going down.
          - Place `num_bottom` BBC pixels in output column `c`, starting at row H-2 and going up.
          - Fill remaining rows between the stacked TBC and BBC pixels (if any) in output column `c` with BGC.
relationships:
  - type: column_independence
    description: The transformation within one column does not affect other columns.
  - type: color_directed_movement
    description: Active pixels of TBC color move towards the top boundary (stacking below it), and active pixels of BBC color move towards the bottom boundary (stacking above it).
