It has a hollow diamond shape (White) with a cross inside (Gray).\n    *   Example 2: The object is made of Blue (1) and Red (2). It looks somewhat like an 'F' or a key, with Blue outlining Red.\n4.  **Output Objects:** Each output grid contains two distinct objects, which are modified copies of the input object.\n5.  **Transformation - Position:** The input object is effectively replaced by two copies, each shifted to a new location. By comparing the bounding boxes of the objects:\n    *   One copy is consistently shifted 4 rows down and 0 columns right relative to the original position.\n    *   The other copy is consistently shifted 1 row down and 4 columns right relative to the original position.\n6.  **Transformation - Color:**\n    *   In Example 1 (White/Gray object), the colors in the output copies remain the same as the input object.\n    *   In Example 2 (Blue/Red object), the colors within the object are swapped in *both* output copies: Blue (1) becomes Red (2), and Red (2) becomes Blue (1).\n7.  **Hypothesis:** The core transformation involves identifying the non-background object, creating two copies, applying specific translations to each copy, and conditionally swapping specific colors (Blue and Red) within the copies before placing them on the output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Determine the bounding box of this object and record its top-left corner coordinates (min_row, min_col).\n4.

Analyze the colors present in the extracted object pattern. Check if both Blue (1) and Red (2) are present.\n6.  Create two copies of the object pattern (relative coordinates and colors).\n7.  If both Blue (1) and Red (2) were found in step 5, modify both copies: change all pixels with color Blue (1) to Red (2), and change all pixels with color Red (2) to Blue (1).\n8.
