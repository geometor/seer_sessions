Task: Duplicate and shift an object, with conditional color swap.

Input:
  Grid:
    Size: Variable (16x16 in examples)
    Background: Azure (8)
    Contains: A single contiguous object composed of non-background colors.

Object:
  Properties:
    - Colors: Set of colors making up the object (e.g., {White(0), Gray(5)}, {Blue(1), Red(2)}).
    - Pixels: List of coordinates and colors for each pixel in the object.
    - BoundingBox: Coordinates of the minimum rectangle enclosing the object.

Transformations:
  - Action: Identify the single non-background object.
  - Action: Create two copies of the object's pixel data (relative positions and colors).
  - Condition: Check if the object's colors include BOTH Blue (1) AND Red (2).
    - If True:
      - Action: In BOTH copies, swap Blue (1) pixels to Red (2) and Red (2) pixels to Blue (1).
  - Action: Translate Copy 1.
    - Source: Original object position (using BoundingBox top-left).
    - Vector: (rows: +4, columns: +0).
  - Action: Translate Copy 2.
    - Source: Original object position (using BoundingBox top-left).
    - Vector: (rows: +1, columns: +4).
  - Action: Compose Output Grid.
    - Start with the background color (Azure/8).
    - Draw the pixels of Translated Copy 1.
    - Draw the pixels of Translated Copy 2.

Output:
  Grid:
    Size: Same as input.
    Background: Azure (8).
    Contains: Two objects, which are the translated (and potentially color-swapped) copies of the input object.
