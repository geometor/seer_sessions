task_type: object_modification
components:
  - role: background
    properties:
      - color: most_frequent_color (Orange/7 in examples)
      - static: generally unchanged unless adjacent to the frame_shape
  - role: frame_shape
    properties:
      - color: most_frequent_non_background_color (Magenta/6 in train_1, Yellow/4 in train_2)
      - shape: forms the larger pattern ('X', diamond)
      - static: position and color preserved in output
  - role: inner_element
    properties:
      - color: least_frequent_non_background_color (Red/2 in train_1, Blue/1 in train_2)
      - shape: smaller elements (pixels, square)
      - static: position and color preserved in output
      - role_in_transformation: provides the target color for modified background pixels
transformation:
  - type: conditional_coloring
    input_pixels: background color pixels
    condition: adjacency (orthogonal or diagonal) to any pixel of the frame_shape color
    output_pixels: changed to inner_element color
    unchanged_pixels:
      - pixels belonging to frame_shape
      - pixels belonging to inner_element
      - background pixels not meeting the adjacency condition
assumptions:
  - Exactly two non-background colors exist in the input.
  - One non-background color appears significantly more often than the other, defining the frame_shape.
