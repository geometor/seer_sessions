The color forming the larger shape appears more frequently than the other non-background color.\n    *   `train_1`: Magenta (6) count > Red (2) count.\n    *   `train_2`: Yellow (4) count > Blue (1) count.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation preserves the original non-background shapes and colors. The key change involves adding new pixels. Specifically, background (Orange) pixels in the input are changed to a specific color in the output if they are adjacent (including diagonally) to the pixels forming the *larger* non-background shape. The color these background pixels are changed *to* is the color of the *smaller* non-background object present in the input.\n6.  **Adjacency:** The adjacency check considers all 8 neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal).\n7.  **Output Pattern:** The added pixels effectively create a \"halo\" or \"border\" around the larger shape, using the color of the smaller shape.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
