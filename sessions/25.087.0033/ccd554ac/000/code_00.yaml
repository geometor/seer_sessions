- task: Tiling a square grid
  description: The task involves scaling up a square input grid by tiling it.
  input_object:
    - type: grid
    - property: square_shape (N x N dimensions)
  output_object:
    - type: grid
    - property: square_shape ((N*N) x (N*N) dimensions)
  transformation:
    - action: determine_dimension
      input: input_grid
      output: N (height or width of the input grid)
    - action: tile
      input: input_grid
      parameters:
        - horizontal_repeats: N
        - vertical_repeats: N
      output: output_grid
  relationship:
    - type: composition
      description: The output grid is composed of N x N copies of the input grid arranged in a larger grid.
    - type: scaling
      description: The output grid dimensions are the square of the input grid dimensions.
