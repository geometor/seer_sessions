*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a large, complex input grid containing various colors and shapes into a small, simple 3x3 output grid. The output grid is always monochromatic (filled with a single color). Observing the examples, the color used in the output grid corresponds to the color of a unique, solid 3x3 square found within the input grid. The rest of the patterns and colors in the input grid seem irrelevant to determining the output.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: transformation
    input_description: A 2D grid (20x20) containing pixels of various colors (0-9), forming different shapes and patterns.
    output_description: A smaller 2D grid (3x3) filled entirely with a single color.
    pertinent_input_features:
      - object: Solid 3x3 Square
        property: Composed of a single, non-white color.
        location: Exists as a subgrid within the input grid.
        uniqueness: There is exactly one such solid 3x3 square in each input grid example.
    transformation:
      - action: Find the unique solid 3x3 square of a single color within the input grid.
      - action: Identify the color of this square.
      - action: Create a new 3x3 grid.
      - action: Fill the new 3x3 grid entirely with the identified color.
    relationship: The color of the unique 3x3 solid square in the input determines the color of the 3x3 output grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Search the input grid for any 3x3 subgrids.
    2.  Identify the 3x3 subgrid that consists entirely of a single, identical color (i.e., a solid-colored 3x3 square).
    3.  Determine the color value of the pixels within this identified 3x3 square.
    4.  Construct the output grid as a 3x3 grid.
    5.  Fill every cell of the output grid with the color value identified in step 3.
