"""
Identifies the colors of the four border segments (top, bottom, left, right) of the input grid.
Iterates through the inner area of the grid (excluding the border).
For each non-white pixel in the inner area:
1. Clears the pixel's original position in the output grid (sets it to white).
2. Checks if the pixel's color matches any of the border colors.
3. If it matches the top border color, places the color in the corresponding column of the row just below the top border (row 1).
4. If it matches the bottom border color, places the color in the corresponding column of the row just above the bottom border (row height - 2).
5. If it matches the left border color, places the color in the corresponding row of the column just right of the left border (column 1).
6. If it matches the right border color, places the color in the corresponding row of the column just left of the right border (column width - 2).
7. If the pixel's color does not match any border color, it is effectively removed (as its original position was cleared).
The border pixels themselves remain unchanged.
