            "text": "**Perception**\n\nThe input and output are grids of colored pixels. Each grid features a distinct border, one pixel thick, on all four sides (top, bottom, left, right). The colors of these border segments remain consistent between the input and output grids. The central area within the border is mostly white (0), containing scattered individual pixels of various colors.\n\nThe core transformation affects only the colored pixels located within the central area (excluding the border). These inner pixels appear to move towards the border segment that shares their color. If a pixel's color matches the top border's color, it moves straight up. If it matches the bottom border, it moves straight down. If it matches the left border, it moves straight left. If it matches the right border, it moves straight right. The movement stops when the pixel reaches the position immediately adjacent to the relevant border segment (i.e., the inner edge of the border).\n\nPixels whose colors do not match any of the four border colors are removed (turned white) in the output grid. The original positions of the pixels that moved or were removed become white in the output. The border pixels themselves are unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
