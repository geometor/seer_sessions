elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - structure: border (1px thick) surrounding a central area
      - background_color: white (0)

  - type: border_pixels
    properties:
      - location: top row, bottom row, leftmost column, rightmost column
      - role: static frame, determines movement direction for inner pixels
      - segments:
          - name: top_border
            location: row 0
            color: varies per example
          - name: bottom_border
            location: last row
            color: varies per example
          - name: left_border
            location: column 0
            color: varies per example
          - name: right_border
            location: last column
            color: varies per example

  - type: inner_pixels
    properties:
      - location: grid cells excluding the border
      - initial_state: mostly white (0) with scattered colored pixels
      - color: varies (0-9)

actions:
  - name: identify_border_colors
    inputs: input grid
    outputs: colors of top, bottom, left, right border segments

  - name: process_inner_pixels
    inputs: 
      - input grid
      - border colors
    description: Iterate through each pixel in the central area (excluding border).
    steps:
      - for each non-white inner pixel:
        - check if its color matches any border color:
          - if match top_border_color:
              action: move_pixel
              direction: up
              target_row: 1
          - if match bottom_border_color:
              action: move_pixel
              direction: down
              target_row: grid_height - 2
          - if match left_border_color:
              action: move_pixel
              direction: left
              target_column: 1
          - if match right_border_color:
              action: move_pixel
              direction: right
              target_column: grid_width - 2
          - if no match:
              action: remove_pixel (set to white) at original location

  - name: construct_output_grid
    inputs: 
      - input grid (for border)
      - processed inner pixel locations and colors
    description: Create the output grid by combining the original border with the final state of the inner area after pixel movements and removals. Initialize the inner area as white, then place the moved pixels at their target locations.

relationships:
  - The color of an inner pixel determines its behavior (move or remove) based on its relationship (match or no match) with the border colors.
  - The direction of movement for a matching inner pixel is determined by which border segment (top, bottom, left, right) its color matches.
  - The final position of a moved pixel is adjacent to the corresponding border segment.
