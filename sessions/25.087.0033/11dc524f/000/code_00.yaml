background_color: 7 # orange
objects:
  - id: red_object
    color: 2 # red
    properties:
      - initial_position: location in the input grid
      - shape: contiguous block of red pixels (variable, e.g., L-shape)
      - dynamic: True (moves)
  - id: gray_object
    color: 5 # gray
    properties:
      - initial_position: location in the input grid (same as final)
      - shape: contiguous block of gray pixels (e.g., 2x2 square)
      - dynamic: False (stationary)
transformation:
  action: move
  actor: red_object
  target: gray_object
  termination_condition: >
    Stop movement when any pixel of the red_object is orthogonally
    or diagonally adjacent to any pixel of the gray_object.
  movement_rule: >
    Iteratively move the red_object one pixel at a time towards the
    gray_object along the axis (vertical or horizontal) that has the
    largest initial separation between the closest points of the two objects.
grid:
  properties:
    - dimensions: height and width (variable per task)
    - content: pixels with colors 0-9
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [red_object, gray_object]
    definition: Orthogonal or diagonal proximity between any pixels of the objects.
    relevance: Defines the stopping point for the red_object's movement.
  - type: relative_position
    between: [red_object, gray_object]
    relevance: Determines the direction of movement for the red_object.
