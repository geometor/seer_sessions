"""
Identifies two objects in the grid: a red object (color 2) and a gray object (color 5), against an orange background (color 7).
The red object moves towards the gray object, one step at a time, along the axis (vertical or horizontal) where the initial separation between their closest points is largest. If the separations are equal, it moves horizontally.
The movement stops when any part of the red object becomes orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any part of the gray object. The gray object remains stationary.
The final grid configuration with the red object in its stopped position is returned.
