*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input grids are 15x15 and predominantly white (0).
    *   Each input grid contains a small number of isolated blue (1) pixels.
    *   In both examples, the blue pixels are arranged along the main diagonal (where row index equals column index).
    *   The positions of the blue pixels form an arithmetic sequence.
        *   Example 1: (0, 0), (4, 4), (8, 8) - step is (4, 4).
        *   Example 2: (1, 1), (3, 3), (5, 5) - step is (2, 2).
    *   The output grids are identical to the input grids, but with additional red (2) pixels.
    *   The red pixels also lie on the same diagonal line established by the blue pixels.
    *   The red pixels start immediately after the last blue pixel in the sequence (the one with the highest row/column index) and continue the arithmetic sequence.
    *   Red pixels are added iteratively using the calculated step until the next position would fall outside the grid boundaries.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - element: grid
        properties:
          - size: variable (15x15 in examples)
          - background_color: white (0)
      - element: blue_pixel
        properties:
          - color: 1
          - quantity: multiple (3 in examples)
          - spatial_relationship: form an arithmetic sequence of coordinates (lie on a straight line with constant steps)
          - role: defines a linear pattern and its step size
      - element: red_pixel
        properties:
          - color: 2
          - quantity: variable (1 in ex1, 4 in ex2)
          - spatial_relationship: continue the arithmetic sequence defined by blue pixels
          - role: marks the extrapolation of the pattern
        origin: added during transformation
    transformation:
      - action: identify_pattern
        description: Locate all blue pixels and determine if their coordinates form an arithmetic sequence.
      - action: calculate_step
        description: If a sequence is found, calculate the step (delta_row, delta_col) between consecutive blue pixels (assuming they are sorted).
      - action: find_start_point
        description: Identify the blue pixel with the largest coordinates in the sequence.
      - action: extrapolate_pattern
        description: Starting from the position after the last blue pixel, iteratively add the step to generate subsequent coordinates.
      - action: add_pixels
        description: For each generated coordinate that falls within the grid boundaries, place a red pixel at that location.
      - action: preserve_input
        description: All pixels from the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
    constraints:
      - grid_boundaries: New red pixels must be placed within the dimensions of the grid.
      - sequence_continuity: Red pixels start one step after the last blue pixel.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
    2.  Determine the coordinates (row, column) of each blue pixel.
    3.  Check if the blue pixel coordinates form an arithmetic sequence (i.e., lie on a line with a constant step). If not, the transformation might be undefined or different (but based on examples, assume they do).
    4.  Calculate the step (delta_row, delta_col) by finding the difference in coordinates between consecutive blue pixels in the sequence (e.g., sort blue pixels by row, then column, and find the difference between the first two).
    5.  Find the blue pixel with the maximum coordinates (e.g., maximum row index, or maximum column index, or maximum sum of indices) to serve as the end of the input sequence. Let its coordinates be (last_row, last_col).
    6.  Initialize the position for the first potential red pixel at (next_row, next_col) = (last_row + delta_row, last_col + delta_col).
    7.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    8.  While the coordinates (next_row, next_col) are within the bounds of the grid:
        a.  Change the color of the pixel at (next_row, next_col) in the output grid to red (2).
        b.  Update the coordinates for the next potential red pixel: (next_row, next_col) = (next_row + delta_row, next_col + delta_col).
    9.  Return the modified output grid.
