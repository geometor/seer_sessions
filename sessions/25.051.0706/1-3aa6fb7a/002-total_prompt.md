Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
task: 001-example_1
input_grid_size: 7x7
output_grid_size: 7x7
objects:
  - color: 8 (azure)
    instances:
      - shape: line
        position: (1,1)
        size: 2x1 # two separate objects
      - shape: rectangle
        position: (2,1)
        size: 2x2

  - color: 0 (white)
    instances:
     - shape: background
       position: all around
       size: 7x7
changes:
  - color_change:
    from: 8 (azure)
    to: 1 (blue)
    positions: [(1,2),(4,5)] # assuming a single object change
```

**Natural Language Program: Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct azure (8) colored objects. One is composed of two 1x1 blocks on the second row. One other is a 2x2 block starting at the coordinates (2,1) and another composed of two 1x1 blocks starting at coordinates (3,4).

2. **Transformation:** Two specific azure cells are changed to blue (1).
    The top right pixel (index 2) of the 2x2 azure square is not changed to blue in the output, it is still azure.
    The pixel to the left of the single bottom right pixel is changed to blue.

3.  **Output:** The output grid reflects these changes, with all other cells remaining the same.

**Natural Language Program Summary:**

The transformation rule identifies all azure (8) objects. The process involves changing specific pixels from azure to blue: The right-most pixel of the top separated 1x1 blocks, and the left-most pixel of the bottom separated 1x1 blocks.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
