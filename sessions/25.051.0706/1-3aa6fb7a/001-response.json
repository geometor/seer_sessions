One is composed of two 1x1 blocks on the second row. One other is a 2x2 block starting at the coordinates (2,1) and another composed of two 1x1 blocks starting at coordinates (3,4).\n\n2. **Transformation:** Two specific azure cells are changed to blue (1).\n    The top right pixel (index 2) of the 2x2 azure square is not changed to blue in the output, it is still azure.\n    The pixel to the left of the single bottom right pixel is changed to blue.\n\n3.  **Output:** The output grid reflects these changes, with all other cells remaining the same.\n\n**Natural Language Program Summary:**\n\nThe transformation rule identifies all azure (8) objects. The process involves changing specific pixels from azure to blue: The right-most pixel of the top separated 1x1 blocks, and the left-most pixel of the bottom separated 1x1 blocks.\n"
