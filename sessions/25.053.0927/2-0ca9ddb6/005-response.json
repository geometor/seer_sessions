            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the example and a plan to tackle it:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into another grid. The input and output grids appear to have the same dimensions. There's a clear change in the colors and the introduction of new colors, suggesting a rule-based transformation rather than a simple structural change (like rotation or mirroring). It appears that we need to identify objects based on their colors, and there is new color added to adjacent pixels of identified objects.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Data Exploration:** Use code execution to determine the dimensions of the input and output grids and list the unique pixel values (colors) present in each. This will establish the basic parameters.\n2.  **Object Identification:** Analyze the input and output to identify potential \"objects\". In this context, an object is likely a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.\n3.  **Transformation Rule Hypothesis:** Based on the identified objects and the changes between input and output, formulate a hypothesis about the transformation rule. For instance, are specific colors triggering changes? Are objects being moved, resized, or recolored?\n4.  **YAML Documentation:** Create a YAML block summarizing the identified objects, their properties (color, position, size), and any observed actions (creation, deletion, modification).\n5.  **Natural Language Program:** Describe the transformation rule in clear, concise natural language. This program should explain, step-by-step, how the input is converted to the output.\n\n**Data Exploration (Code Execution):**\n\n"
