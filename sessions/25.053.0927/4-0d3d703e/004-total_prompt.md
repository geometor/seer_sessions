# Example

**input:**
```
2 3 8
2 3 8
2 3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x78308A98B5B0>

**output:**
```
6 4 9
6 4 9
6 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x78308A98A9B0>
Okay, here's a breakdown of the example and a plan to figure out the transformation:

**General Assessment:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The dimensions of the grid remain constant.  This suggests a per-pixel transformation where each input pixel's value maps to a corresponding output pixel's value. The transformation appears to be a simple substitution cipher, where each color in the input is mapped to a unique color in the output.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Data Extraction:** Use code execution to represent the input and output grids as 2D arrays (lists of lists).
2.  **Mapping Identification:** Create a dictionary to map input values to output values by iterating through corresponding pixels in the input and output grids.
3.  **Program Description:** Describe the transformation as a simple color substitution rule using the mapping identified.
4.  **Report in YAML:** Document findings in a YAML block

**Gather Metrics and Report:**



*code_execution:*
```python
input_grid = [
    [2, 3, 8],
    [2, 3, 8],
    [2, 3, 8]
]

output_grid = [
    [6, 4, 9],
    [6, 4, 9],
    [6, 4, 9]
]

# Create a mapping dictionary
mapping = {}
for i in range(len(input_grid)):
    for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):
        mapping[input_grid[i][j]] = output_grid[i][j]

print(f"{mapping=}")

```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: 1
```
mapping={2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9}

```
**YAML Report:**


```yaml
observations:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_values: [2, 3, 8]
    output_values: [6, 4, 9]
    transformation_type: color_substitution
  
mapping:
  2: 6 # red to magenta
  3: 4 # green to yellow
  8: 9 # azure to maroon

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation is a simple color substitution. Each pixel in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding pixel in the output grid based on the following mapping:

*   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6)
*   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4)
*   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9)

The spatial location of pixels is maintained; only the values change according to the substitution rule.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
