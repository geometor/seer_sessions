The provided images visually represent the grids, but the text representation is crucial for programmatic manipulation.  My strategy is to first analyze the provided text representations of the input and output, looking for obvious patterns.  If a simple, direct mapping isn't apparent, I'll use the image representations to help visualize object movement or color changes that might not be immediately obvious from the numerical data. I will create a plan that can be generalized, rather than memorizing specific input-output pairs.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Initial Observations (using code):**\n\nI'll start by examining the text representations of the input and output grids to gather some basic metrics and see if any simple relationships jump out.\n\n"
