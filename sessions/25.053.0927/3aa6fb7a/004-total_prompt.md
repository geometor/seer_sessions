Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a simple observation: adding blue pixels to the left and right of azure pixels. However, the test results reveal a flaw in this approach. The code incorrectly adds blue pixels adjacent to *any* azure pixel, regardless of whether it's already adjacent to another azure pixel. It looks like we need a more strict rule, that blue pixels are only placed to the right of a sequence of one or more azure pixels, and to the left of a sequence of one or more azure pixels. It appears only a single blue pixel is added at the boundary of azure pixels sequences, not to each individually.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Here's a breakdown of the examples, incorporating a more detailed analysis:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** A 7x7 grid with azure pixels at (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), and (3,5).
*   **Expected Output:** Azure pixels remain. Blue pixels at (1,2) and (4,4),
*   **Transformed Output:** Blue is placed to the left and right of every azure.
*   **Issues:** The code adds a blue pixel to all sides of all azure pixels, including placing blue on top of azure, and including blue pixels where there should be white pixels.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** A 7x7 grid.
*   **Expected Output:** Only placing blue after the end of the sequence
*   **Transformed Output:** Placing blue adjacent to all azure
*   **Issues**: Same problem as above

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify** all *horizontal sequences* of one or more contiguous azure pixels (value `8`) in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve** all azure pixels in these sequences in their original positions in the output grid.
3.  **Introduce** a *single* blue pixel (value `1`) immediately to the right of the *end* of each azure pixel sequence, if there is available space within the grid boundaries.
4.  **Introduce** a *single* blue pixel (value `1`) immediately to the left of the *start* of each azure pixel sequence, if there is available space within the grid boundaries.
5.  **Fill** all other positions in the output grid with `0` (white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
