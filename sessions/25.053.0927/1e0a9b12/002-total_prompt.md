# Example

**input:**
```
0 4 0 9
0 0 0 0
0 4 6 0
1 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x78308B303580>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 4 0 0
1 4 6 9
```

Okay, here's my assessment of the provided example and a plan for figuring out the transformation:

**General Assessment:**

The task involves transforming a 4x4 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 4x4 grid.  The provided images visually represent the grids, but the text representation is crucial for programmatic manipulation.  My strategy is to first analyze the provided text representations of the input and output, looking for obvious patterns.  If a simple, direct mapping isn't apparent, I'll use the image representations to help visualize object movement or color changes that might not be immediately obvious from the numerical data. I will create a plan that can be generalized, rather than memorizing specific input-output pairs.

**Gather Metrics and Initial Observations (using code):**

I'll start by examining the text representations of the input and output grids to gather some basic metrics and see if any simple relationships jump out.



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([
    [0, 4, 0, 9],
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 4, 6, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 0]
])

output_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 4, 0, 0],
    [1, 4, 6, 9]
])

# Check for elements that remain in the same position
same_position = (input_grid == output_grid)
print(f"Elements in the same position:\n{same_position}\n")

# Count the number of each element in input and output
input_counts = np.unique(input_grid, return_counts=True)
output_counts = np.unique(output_grid, return_counts=True)

print(f"Input element counts: {input_counts}\n")
print(f"Output element counts: {output_counts}\n")

# check difference
diff = output_grid - input_grid
print(f'Difference:\n{diff}')

```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: 1
```
Elements in the same position:
[[ True False  True False]
 [ True  True  True  True]
 [ True  True False  True]
 [ True False False False]]

Input element counts: (array([0, 1, 4, 6, 9]), array([11,  1,  2,  1,  1]))

Output element counts: (array([0, 1, 4, 6, 9]), array([11,  1,  2,  1,  1]))

Difference:
[[ 0 -4  0 -9]
 [ 0  0  0  0]
 [ 0  0 -6  0]
 [ 0  4  6  9]]

```
**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The input and output grids are both 4x4."
  - observation: "The grids contain single-digit integers from 0 to 9, representing colors."
  - observation: "The number of each digit is identical in both grids. So no change of values, just positions"
  - observation: "Most of the '0' (white) pixels remain in the same position."
  - observation: "Non-zero pixels mostly change their positions"
  - observation: "The non-zero pixels seem to be moved to the last row."
  - object_identification: "The non-zero digits can be considered as individual objects"
  - action: "The non-zero objects are relocated to the last row maintaining the original column based order."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Treat each non-zero pixel in the input grid as a separate object.
2.  **Record Order:** Note the original column order of these non-zero objects from left to right, top to bottom.
3.  **Clear Rows:** set all the values in rows 1-3 to 0.
4. **Relocate Objects:** Move all identified objects to the last row of the grid. Place them in the last row from left to right, maintaining the original order
5.  **Preserve Zeros:** All other cells (containing '0') remain unchanged if they were zero on a row that is now all zeros.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
