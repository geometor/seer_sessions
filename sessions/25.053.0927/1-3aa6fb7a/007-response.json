            "text": "Okay, here's my assessment of the example input-output pair and my plan to figure out the transformation:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe input and output are both 7x7 grids. The primary difference appears to be the introduction of the number '1' (blue) in the output grid, seemingly related to the position of '8' (azure) in the input grid. The task likely involves detecting '8's and placing '1's based on some spatial or adjacency rule relative to the '8's. It does not look like a simple mirroring, rotation, or global transformation.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** Identify the objects in the input, which seem to be contiguous blocks of '8's and background '0's.\n2.  **Spatial Analysis:** Analyze the spatial relationship between the '8's in the input and the '1's in the output. Specifically, I want to find where the 1 is in relationship to the 8's.\n3.  **Rule Hypothesis:** Formulate a hypothesis about the placement rule (e.g., \"Place a '1' to the immediate left of the westernmost '8' in each isolated group, westernmost first\").\n4.  **Verification (Later):** When I'm in the coder phase, use the code to verify if this rule applies to all cases and generate the output.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**\n\nI'll use python to load the grids and extract some properties for reporting and analysis. I'll count the occurrences of each color, find bounding boxes, and identify immediate neighbors. I can't use images, only the text data.\n\n"
