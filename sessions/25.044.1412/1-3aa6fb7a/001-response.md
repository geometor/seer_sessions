**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Connected Regions:** Detect the two distinct, connected regions formed by cells with value '8' in the input grid.
2. **Determine Bounding Boxes:** For each of these regions, calculate the smallest bounding box that encloses all cells of the region. This box is defined by its top row, bottom row, left column, and right column.
3. **Order Regions:** Compare the bounding boxes of the two regions. The region whose bounding box has a smaller top row index, or in case of a tie, a smaller left column index, is considered the "first" region. The other is the "second" region.
4. **Modify First Region:** For the "first" region, locate the cell at the intersection of the top row of its bounding box and the right column of its bounding box. Change the value of this cell to '1'.
5. **Modify Second Region:** For the "second" region, locate the cell at the intersection of the bottom row of its bounding box and the left column of its bounding box. Change the value of this cell to '1'.
6. **Preserve Unchanged Cells:** All cells in the grid that are not modified in steps 4 and 5 retain their original values from the input grid.

**Explanation of Objects, Properties, and Actions:**

* **Objects:**
    * **Grid:** The input and output 2D array of numbers.
    * **Regions of '8's:** Connected groups of cells with value '8'.
    * **Bounding Box:** Rectangular area defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of a region.
    * **Cell:** Individual element in the grid, identified by its row and column index.
* **Properties (Predicates):**
    * **Connected:** Property of cells being adjacent (horizontally or vertically) and having the same value ('8').
    * **Value '8':** Property of a cell having the value 8.
    * **Bounding Box Coordinates:** Top row, bottom row, left column, right column of a bounding box.
    * **Top-Left Corner:** The cell at the top-left of a bounding box, used for ordering.
    * **Top-Right Corner:** The cell at the top-right of a bounding box.
    * **Bottom-Left Corner:** The cell at the bottom-left of a bounding box.
* **Actions:**
    * **Identify:** Detect regions of '8's.
    * **Calculate:** Determine the bounding box for each region.
    * **Order:** Rank regions based on their bounding box top-left corner.
    * **Locate:** Find specific cells within the bounding box (top-right, bottom-left).
    * **Change Value:** Modify the value of a cell to '1'.
    * **Preserve:** Keep the value of cells unchanged.
