**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Connected Regions:** Detect the two distinct, connected regions formed by cells with value '8' in the input grid.
2. **Determine Bounding Boxes:** For each of these regions, calculate the smallest bounding box that encloses all cells of the region. This box is defined by its top row, bottom row, left column, and right column.
3. **Order Regions:** Compare the bounding boxes of the two regions. The region whose bounding box has a smaller top row index, or in case of a tie, a smaller left column index, is considered the "first" region. The other is the "second" region.
4. **Modify First Region:** For the "first" region, locate the cell at the intersection of the top row of its bounding box and the right column of its bounding box. Change the value of this cell to '1'.
5. **Modify Second Region:** For the "second" region, locate the cell at the intersection of the bottom row of its bounding box and the left column of its bounding box. Change the value of this cell to '1'.
6. **Preserve Unchanged Cells:** All cells in the grid that are not modified in steps 4 and 5 retain their original values from the input grid.

**Explanation of Objects, Properties, and Actions:**

* **Objects:**
    * **Grid:** The input and output 2D array of numbers.
    * **Regions of '8's:** Connected groups of cells with value '8'.
    * **Bounding Box:** Rectangular area defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of a region.
    * **Cell:** Individual element in the grid, identified by its row and column index.
* **Properties (Predicates):**
    * **Connected:** Property of cells being adjacent (horizontally or vertically) and having the same value ('8').
    * **Value '8':** Property of a cell having the value 8.
    * **Bounding Box Coordinates:** Top row, bottom row, left column, right column of a bounding box.
    * **Top-Left Corner:** The cell at the top-left of a bounding box, used for ordering.
    * **Top-Right Corner:** The cell at the top-right of a bounding box.
    * **Bottom-Left Corner:** The cell at the bottom-left of a bounding box.
* **Actions:**
    * **Identify:** Detect regions of '8's.
    * **Calculate:** Determine the bounding box for each region.
    * **Order:** Rank regions based on their bounding box top-left corner.
    * **Locate:** Find specific cells within the bounding box (top-right, bottom-left).
    * **Change Value:** Modify the value of a cell to '1'.
    * **Preserve:** Keep the value of cells unchanged.
**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again
