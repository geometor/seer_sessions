The separate single azure is on (4,4)\n        \n      - color: 0\n        shape: background\n        positions: fills the remaining cells\n\n  output_grid:\n    objects:\n      - color: 8\n        shape: same as input.\n        positions: \n          - (1,1) and (2,1)\n          - (3,5) and (4,5)\n      - color: 1\n        shape: single cell\n        positions:\n          - (1,2) # top-left azure region replaced with 1\n          - (4,4) # bottom right azure region replaced with 1\n      - color: 0\n        shape: background\n        positions: fills the remaining cells\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two separate regions of color `8` (azure). One is the vertical shape of size two composed by stacked azure cells on the second column. The second element is an horizontal shape composed by two azure cells side by side on the fifth column. There is a separate single azure cell on (4,4).\n\n2.  **Predicate:** Select one azure object with only one cell. If it is not unique, then iterate.\n\n3.  **Action, Change Color:** Change the color of the top cell of the vertical object from `8` to `1` (blue) and change the color of the left cell of the horizontal object from `8` to `1`.\n\nIn summary, two azure cells, top and left on each azure shape, were replaced by blue cells.\n"
