```python
"""
The output grid is generated by processing each column of the input grid independently. For each column, identify any non-white pixels. If no non-white pixels are present in that column, the output column is all white (0). If non-white pixels exist in the column, fill the entire output column from top to bottom with the color of the non-white pixel that has the smallest row index (i.e., is closest to the top of the input grid). If multiple pixels in the column share the smallest row index, their color will overwrite from top to bottom, so the pixel that occurs later/lower will dominate.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code are based on a "column-wise top-most non-white pixel dominance" rule.  While this captures some aspect of the transformation, it's clearly insufficient.  The expected outputs show a more complex pattern where the colors in a column *repeat* based on all non-white colors in the input, and the order of the non-white colors matters. The provided code only uses the top-most. The strategy will involve changing the existing program significantly to reflect the repeating column pattern seen in the expected outputs.

**Gather Metrics and Results:**

Here's a summary of the metrics for each example, focusing on elements not yet described in the previous prompt:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has non-white pixels in columns 5 (red) and 7 (azure).
    *   Expected output alternates red and azure in *every* column that contains non-white pixel, the output fills the whole column and repeats red, azure, red, azure ...

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has non-white pixels in columns 5 (blue) and 8 (green).
    *   Expected output alternates blue and green in those columns that have non-white pixels, repeating from top to bottom of the output grid: blue, green, blue, green.

*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input contains red in the first column and green in the last.
    *   Expected output is more complex and appears to be a repeating sequence
    *    The sequence of red, then white, then green occurs down the length of *all* of the columns.

*   **Example 4:**
    *    Input contains yellow in the first column, and blue in the first column
        as well.
    *    Expected Output has columns alternating between yellow and blue with
         white stripes, filling columns where the colors exist in the input.
         yellow, blue, yellow, blue

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example: 1
    input_objects:
      - color: red
        column: 5
      - color: azure
        column: 7
    output_pattern: |
      Columns with non-white input pixels repeat the sequence of those colors
      down the entire column. Columns without non-white input pixels are all white.

  - example: 2
    input_objects:
      - color: blue
        column: 5
      - color: green
        column: 8
    output_pattern: |
      Columns with non-white input pixels repeat the sequence of those colors
      down the entire column. Columns without non-white input pixels are all white.

  - example: 3
    input_objects:
      - color: red
        column: 0
      - color: green
        column: 8
    output_pattern: |
        all columns become a repeating sequence of all non-white colors, top to bottom.

  - example: 4
    input_objects:
        - color: yellow
          column: 0
        - color: blue
          column: 0

    output_pattern: |
       all columns become a repeating sequence of all non-white colors, top to bottom.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-White Colors:** Examine the entire input grid and create an ordered list of all unique non-white colors present, maintaining their original order of appearance from top to bottom, left to right.
2.  **Process Each Column** Iterate through each column of the *output* grid.
3.  **Fill Columns with color sequence**. Fill each cell down the column with the ordered color sequence, repeat until the end of the column
    .

This revised natural language program addresses the repeating pattern and column-wise application, deviating significantly from the initial "top-most" logic.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
