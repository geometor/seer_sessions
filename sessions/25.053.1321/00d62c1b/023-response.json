            "text": "Here's an analysis of the results and a revised natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code correctly identified the core concept: changing \"inner\" green pixels to yellow. However, the code's implementation of \"inner\" is flawed. The current `is_inner_pixel` function only checks for direct adjacency (up, down, left, right). It doesn't correctly handle cases where a green pixel might be part of a larger green region but not truly \"inner\" because it's on an edge or corner of that larger region. The examples clearly demonstrate that \"inner\" means surrounded on *all four sides* by green pixels *within a contiguous block*. The errors in multiple examples are due to this misinterpretation. The main strategy will be to revise what \"inner\" means, and to make use of the `find_contiguous_regions` function. We shouldn't process individual pixels; We process green *regions* discovered by `find_contiguous_regions`, then iterate through the pixels *of each region* and use *that region* to determine \"innerness\".\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a summary of observations based on *all* training examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The original code failed to turn two green pixels to yellow. The green pixels at (2,2) and (3,3) should be yellow.\n*   **Example 2:** The original code failed to turn two green pixels to yellow. The green pixels at (4,6) should be yellow.\n*   **Example 3:** The original code failed to turn nine green pixels to yellow.\n*   **Example 4:** The original code failed to turn six green pixels to yellow.\n*   **Example 5:** The original code failed to turn 31 green pixels to yellow.\n\nThe common thread across all failures is the incorrect identification of \"inner\" pixels. Pixels on edges and corners of green regions are not transformed when they should be.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: grid\n    type: 2D array\n    description: Represents the input and output image.\n  - name: green_region\n    type: list of tuples\n    description: A contiguous block of green pixels.\n  - name: pixel\n    type: tuple (row, col)\n    description: Represents a single cell in the grid.\n    properties:\n      color: int (0-9)\n\nactions:\n  - name: find_contiguous_regions\n    input: grid, color\n    output: list of green_regions\n    description: Identifies all contiguous regions of the specified color.\n  - name: is_inner_pixel\n    input: grid, row, col, color\n    output: boolean\n    description: Determines if a pixel is surrounded on all four sides by pixels of the same color within a contiguous block.\n  - name: transform\n    input: input_grid\n    output: output_grid\n    description: Modifies the input grid by changing inner green pixels to yellow.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Green Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of green (color value 3) pixels in the input grid. A contiguous region is a group of pixels of the same color that are connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally). Use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to achieve this.\n\n2.  **Identify Inner Pixels within Each Region:** For *each* identified green region, iterate through its pixels. A green pixel is considered \"inner\" if and only if it is part of the green region *and* is directly adjacent (above, below, left, and right) to four other green pixels *that are also part of the same region*.\n\n3.  **Transform Inner Pixels:** Change the color of all identified \"inner\" green pixels from green (3) to yellow (4).\n\n4.  **Output:** The output is the input grid, modified with \"inner\" green pixels changed to yellow. The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.\n"
