"""
1.  **Identify Green Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of green (3) pixels in the input grid. Consider pixels connected if they share an edge (4-connectivity).
2.  **Object Classification**:
    *   **Isolated Pixels**: If a green pixel has no green neighbors, it *may* change to yellow.
    *   **Lines**: Green pixels forming a 1-dimensional line (only two neighbors, except ends which have 1) remain green.
    *  **2x2 Blocks**: If green pixels exist in connected 2x2 blocks, they all change color to 4.
    *  **Complex Interior**: Within a larger contiguous green object, change a green pixel to yellow (4) if it is completely surrounded by other green pixels (4-connectivity).
3.  **Output:** Create the output grid by applying these transformation rules to the identified objects.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
