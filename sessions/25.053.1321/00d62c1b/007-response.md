Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code attempted to identify green "+" shaped structures and change the center pixel to yellow. However, the results show numerous mismatches, indicating that the logic is either incomplete or incorrect. The primary issue is that it's only changing *some* of the center pixels of the plus-shaped green objects, not all of them, and sometimes it doesn't change center pluses that *should* change, and finally, sometimes changes pixels that aren't center pixels.

The strategy should involve:

1.  **Refining the "center" pixel identification:** The current `is_center_pixel` function only checks for immediate neighbors. It needs to ensure the entire horizontal and vertical arms of the "+" are of sufficient length, not just that there is any neighboring pixel. The existing get_line_length appears correct.
2.  **Consistency:** Ensure *all* valid center pixels are transformed, not just some. The errors from the previous runs seem to have an issue in the main loop logic, the center detection or the get line length function.
3.  **Re-evaluating the conditions**: Double-check all criteria for transforming a pixel (color, neighbors, line lengths).

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a summary of the results, noting key discrepancies:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Missed changing the center of one of the pluses
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Missed changing one, but changed one it shouldn't have.
*   **Example 3:**
    *    Missed changing any of the pluses at all.
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Missed changing the center of all pluses
*   **Example 5:**
    *   Missed changing *most* of the pluses.

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
facts:
  - description: "Green pixels can form '+' shaped objects."
  - property: color
    value: green (3)
  - property: shape
    value: "+"
  - property: center
    value: "The pixel where the horizontal and vertical lines of the '+' intersect."
  - action: "Change the color of the center pixel of '+' shaped objects."
  - action_condition: "The '+' shaped object must have horizontal and vertical arms of at least length 3 (including the center)."
  - from_color: green (3)
  - to_color: yellow (4)
  - object: grid
    description: "The input and output are 2D grids of pixels."

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify** all green (3) pixels in the input grid.
2.  For each green pixel, **determine** if it is the center of a "+" shaped object.
3.  A pixel is considered the center of a "+" if:
    *   It has green pixels directly above, below, to the left, and to the right.
    *   The continuous line of green pixels extending horizontally (left and right) from the center pixel is at least 3 pixels long (including the center pixel).
    *   The continuous line of green pixels extending vertically (up and down) from the center pixel is at least 3 pixels long (including the center pixel).
4. If a green pixel meets the criteria for being a "+" center, **change** its color to yellow (4) in the output grid.
5. All other pixels remain **unchanged** from their original values in the input grid.
6. **Return** the modified grid.
