Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was a good first attempt, focusing on identifying green objects and applying some basic transformation rules (isolated pixels, 2x2 blocks, and interior pixels). However, the tests reveal that the logic is incomplete and makes incorrect transformations in several cases.  The primary issue is that the 2x2 block check happens *before* and *independent* of the interior check. The interior check is also too simplistic. It needs to consider what the green pixel *should* be inside of. Also, there's a missing critical concept of object boundaries.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Prioritize the 2x2 block detection**: The core concept is that 2x2 green blocks *always* become yellow. This should be handled as the highest priority check, *before* any other transformations.
2.  **Refine "Interior" Detection**:  The current "interior" check is simply checking for 4 green neighbors.  This is incorrect. A green pixel should only change to yellow if it is *within* a larger green object *and* is not part of a 2x2 block.  This requires a more nuanced approach. We need to identify the *boundary* of each green object, and only change green to yellow inside the object, except for 2x2 areas.
3. **Improve Object Identification**: Ensure we are correctly identifying green connected components.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**
I am assuming that there is an error with the display of example 3, since there are 10 rows, but the 2x2 detection would require 11 rows to place the changed pixel correctly.

Here's a breakdown by example, incorporating facts into a YAML structure:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Regions:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of green pixels.  Pixels are considered connected if they share an edge (4-connectivity).

2.  **Prioritize 2x2 Blocks:** Within each green region, check *every* green pixel to see if it is the top-left corner of a 2x2 block of green pixels. If it is, change *all four* pixels in that 2x2 block to yellow (value 4).

3.  **Identify Boundaries:** For each green region, determine its boundary pixels. A boundary pixel is a green pixel that has at least one neighbor (4-connectivity) that is *not* green.

4. **Fill Interior with Yellow**: For each green region change green pixels to yellow if all neighbors are part of the same green object AND it is NOT part of a 2x2 block.

5.  **Output:** Create the output grid by applying these transformation rules. All unchanged pixels retain original values.
