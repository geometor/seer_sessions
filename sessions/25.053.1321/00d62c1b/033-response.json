The primary color in the input is green (3), with a background of white (0).  The output grid introduces yellow (4) in specific locations within the green (3) regions, suggesting an infilling or outlining operation. The transformation appears to be based on the shape and layout of the existing green regions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Change these inner green pixels to yellow (4).\n3. **Diagonal Infill:** In addition, change to yellow any green pixel that has at least two green pixels diagonally adjacent to it.\n4. **Preserve Others:**  All other pixels, including the white background (0) and green pixels not meeting the \"inner\" or diagonal infill criteria, remain unchanged.\n\nThis program outlines a two-stage infilling process within the green regions, targeting both fully surrounded pixels and those with specific diagonal connectivity.\n"
