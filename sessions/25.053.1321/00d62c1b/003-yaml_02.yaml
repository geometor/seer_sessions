observations:
  - task: 002
    objects:
      - color: green (3)
        description: Input pixels that may change color.
        properties:
          - adjacency: Adjacent green pixels form lines or connected components.
          - transformation_trigger:  Green pixels change color if within a "line segment"
            of at least three contiguous green pixels horizontally and/or vertically.
      - color: yellow (4)
        description: Output color for transformed green pixels.
        properties: []
    actions:
      - name: change_color
        precondition: Green pixel is part of a connected "line segment" including itself of at least three contiguous green pixels, horizontally and/or vertically.
        postcondition: Green pixel becomes yellow.
    context: |
      The input and output grids are the same size.  Only green pixels change color; all
      other pixels remain unchanged. The change depends on a green pixel being part
      of a horizontal or vertical line segment, or a combination of both, with a minimum length
      of three green pixels.
