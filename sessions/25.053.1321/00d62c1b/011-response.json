            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our understanding of the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the assumption that a single '3' (green) pixel within a contiguous green object would be changed to '4' (yellow), and that this pixel would be centered horizontally and one row above the bottom row of the shape. The results clearly show this isn't always the case. Specifically, multiple pixels can change, and they aren't always neatly centered or on the second-to-last row. Example 3, in particular, has a significant number of pixel changes. Example 5 shows an even more complex pattern.\n\nThe main issue is that the code *restricts* the transformation to a *single* pixel on a *specific row*. A better strategy is to identify all connected '3's, and within that region, look for a *pattern* of '3's that change to '4's, relative to their local neighbors. This may mean looking at multiple rows, potentially all rows that are within the identified object. It is clear from the more complex examples, that all eligible pixels within the object are changed.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a summary of the observations from each example, combining manual inspection with some assumptions that we'll refine:\n\n| Example | Input Shape (Green Object) | Output Shape (Green & Yellow) | Pixels Changed | Notes                                                                                       |\n|---------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1       | 3x3, some disconnected      | Same, with two 4s              | 2              | Center of object assumption was incorrect.                                                   |\n| 2       | Irregular, multi-row         | Same, with one 4            | 1              |  The horizontal center and second-to-last row rule appears to work *by coincidence* here.|\n| 3       | Complex, multi-row         | Many 3s become 4s          | 9            | Many changes, invalidating the single-pixel and row assumptions.                           |\n| 4       | Irregular, multi-row.      | Many 3s become 4s            | 6             | Again, multiple changes, disproving the single-pixel assumption.                               |\n| 5       | Very Large, multi-row           | Very many 3's become 4s           | 31              | This is the most telling - demonstrates a much wider-ranging transformation.                    |\n\n**YAML Fact Identification**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task: \"Change green pixels to yellow within a green object.\"\n  - objects:\n      - color: 3  # Green\n        type: \"contiguous shape\"\n        properties:\n          - \"can vary in size and shape\"\n          - \"pixels within the shape can change color\"\n  - actions:\n      - find: \"contiguous shapes of color 3\"\n      - transform:\n          color_change:\n            from: 3  # Green\n            to: 4  # Yellow\n          conditions:\n            - \"Applies to multiple pixels within the green shape\"\n            - \"Exact positions change are relative to the overall shape and inner adjacencies\"\n  - constraints:\n    - \"Only pixels within the identified green object are affected.\"\n    - \"Pixels outside the object remain unchanged.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate all contiguous regions (objects) of '3' (green) pixels in the input grid. Contiguous means connected pixels sharing sides (4-connectivity: up, down, left, right).\n\n2.  **Apply Transformation Within Object:** Within each identified green object, change *all* pixels that originally had a value '3' to '4', IF that pixel is part of the connected component of '3' pixels.\n\n3. **Preserve Other Pixels:** All pixels in the grid that are *not* part of a green object (i.e., not a '3' inside a contiguous green shape) should remain unchanged.\n"
