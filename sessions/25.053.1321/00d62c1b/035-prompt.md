"""
1. **Identify Green Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of green (3) pixels within the 20x20 grid.
2. **Inner Infill:** For each green region, identify any green pixel that is completely surrounded by other green pixels (up, down, left, and right). Change these inner green pixels to yellow (4).
3. **Diagonal Infill:** In addition, change to yellow any green pixel that has at least two green pixels diagonally adjacent to it.
4. **Preserve Others:**  All other pixels, including the white background (0) and green pixels not meeting the "inner" or diagonal infill criteria, remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
