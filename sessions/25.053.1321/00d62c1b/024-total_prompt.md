Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Green Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of green (color value 3) pixels in the input grid.  A contiguous region is a group of pixels of the same color that are connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).

2.  **Identify Inner Green Pixels:** Within each green region, identify "inner" green pixels. A green pixel is considered "inner" if and only if it is directly adjacent (above, below, left, and right) to *four* other green pixels.

3.  **Transform Inner Pixels:** Change the color of all identified "inner" green pixels from green (3) to yellow (4).

4. **Output:** The output is the input grid modified with "inner" green cells changed to yellow.

Here's an analysis of the results and a revised natural language program:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code correctly identified the core concept: changing "inner" green pixels to yellow. However, the code's implementation of "inner" is flawed. The current `is_inner_pixel` function only checks for direct adjacency (up, down, left, right). It doesn't correctly handle cases where a green pixel might be part of a larger green region but not truly "inner" because it's on an edge or corner of that larger region. The examples clearly demonstrate that "inner" means surrounded on *all four sides* by green pixels *within a contiguous block*. The errors in multiple examples are due to this misinterpretation. The main strategy will be to revise what "inner" means, and to make use of the `find_contiguous_regions` function. We shouldn't process individual pixels; We process green *regions* discovered by `find_contiguous_regions`, then iterate through the pixels *of each region* and use *that region* to determine "innerness".

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a summary of observations based on *all* training examples:

*   **Example 1:** The original code failed to turn two green pixels to yellow. The green pixels at (2,2) and (3,3) should be yellow.
*   **Example 2:** The original code failed to turn two green pixels to yellow. The green pixels at (4,6) should be yellow.
*   **Example 3:** The original code failed to turn nine green pixels to yellow.
*   **Example 4:** The original code failed to turn six green pixels to yellow.
*   **Example 5:** The original code failed to turn 31 green pixels to yellow.

The common thread across all failures is the incorrect identification of "inner" pixels. Pixels on edges and corners of green regions are not transformed when they should be.

**YAML Facts**

  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the input and output image.
  - name: green_region
    type: list of tuples
    description: A contiguous block of green pixels.
  - name: pixel
    type: tuple (row, col)
    description: Represents a single cell in the grid.
    properties:
      color: int (0-9)

actions:
  - name: find_contiguous_regions
    input: grid, color
    output: list of green_regions
    description: Identifies all contiguous regions of the specified color.
  - name: is_inner_pixel
    input: grid, row, col, color
    output: boolean

  - name: transform
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Modifies the input grid by changing inner green pixels to yellow.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Green Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of green (color value 3) pixels in the input grid. A contiguous region is a group of pixels of the same color that are connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally). Use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to achieve this.

2.  **Identify Inner Pixels within Each Region:** For *each* identified green region, iterate through its pixels. A green pixel is considered "inner" if and only if it is part of the green region *and* is directly adjacent (above, below, left, and right) to four other green pixels *that are also part of the same region*.

3.  **Transform Inner Pixels:** Change the color of all identified "inner" green pixels from green (3) to yellow (4).

4.  **Output:** The output is the input grid, modified with "inner" green pixels changed to yellow. The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
