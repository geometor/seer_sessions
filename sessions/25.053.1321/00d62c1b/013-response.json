            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the tests and refine the natural language program and overall strategy.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of finding *all* green (3) pixels and changing them to yellow (4). However, the test results clearly show this isn't the complete rule.  The expected outputs demonstrate that only *some* green pixels within a contiguous green object are changed to yellow, and this change seems related to the shape and connectivity of the green object.  The current `find_object` function correctly identifies contiguous regions, but the transformation logic is too simplistic. It changes *all* green pixels in an object, while it should only change a subset based on a more complex criteria. It also does not accurately find only a single object.\n\nMy strategy will be:\n\n1.  **Analyze the failures**: Examine the `pixels_off` in each example and the transformed images to understand where the logic is incorrect. I will focus on the spatial relationships between green and yellow pixels in the expected output.\n2.  **Refine object properties**: I need to characterize the green objects more comprehensively. This includes not only their coordinates but also features like their bounding box, perimeter, and internal structure.\n3. **Revisit the color change**: The condition to change color should not be simply, change all, but depend on position within a larger shape.\n4. **Iterate and Develop**: start with adding observations to YAML.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using assumed code execution results from above):**\n\nI'll summarize the provided test results, including the pixel differences:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | `pixels_off` | Notes                                                                                               |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | (6, 6)      | (6, 6)       | 3            | Only one '3' changed to '4'; others stay '3'. It appears connected '3's are not an object.       |\n| 2       | (10, 10)    | (10, 10)     | 2            | Again, only some '3's change. There seems to be no change when object is only in 1 dimension        |\n| 3       | (10, 10)    | (10, 10)     | 10           | Many mismatches. It appears '3's that make up a 2x2 shape become 4                                    |\n| 4       | (10, 10)    | (10, 10)     | 31           | A large, complex green object.  The interior '3's seem more likely to change.                       |\n| 5       | (20, 20)    | (20, 20)     | 32           | Very large and complex. Interior green surrounded by green, is becoming yellow.                       |\n\n**YAML Block (Observations):**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - color: 3\n        shape: dispersed\n        contiguous: false\n        notes: \"Single green pixels and lines, not considered a cohesive object for transformation.\"\n    output_objects:\n      - color: 3\n        shape: dispersed\n      - color: 4 # single value\n        shape: point\n        contiguous: false\n    transformation: \"Isolated green pixels remain unchanged.

Consider pixels connected if they share an edge (4-connectivity).\n2.  **Object Classification**:\n    *   **Isolated Pixels**: If a green pixel has no green neighbors, it *may* change to yellow.\n    *   **Lines**: Green pixels forming a 1-dimensional line (only two neighbors, except ends which have 1) remain green.\n    *  **2x2 Blocks**: If green pixels exist in connected 2x2 blocks, they all change color to 4.\n    *  **Complex Interior**: Within a larger contiguous green object, change a green pixel to yellow (4) if it is completely surrounded by other green pixels (4-connectivity).\n3.  **Output:** Create the output grid by applying these transformation rules to the identified objects.\n\nThis refined program incorporates the observation that only *some* green pixels change, and that the change depends on the local neighborhood of each pixel.  It differentiates between isolated pixels, lines, and the interior of larger objects.\n"
