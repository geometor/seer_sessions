        notes: "Single green pixels and lines, not considered a cohesive object for transformation."
    output_objects:

        shape: dispersed
      - color: 4 # single value
        shape: point
        contiguous: false
    transformation: "Isolated green pixels remain unchanged. A single green pixel can change to yellow."

  - example: 2
    input_objects:
      - color: 3
        shape: lines
        contiguous: false
        notes: "Linear arrangements of green pixels."
    output_objects:
     - color: 3
       shape: line
       contiguous: false
    transformation: "Linear green structures remain unchanged."

  - example: 3
    input_objects:
      - color: 3
        shape: mixed
        contiguous: true
        notes: "Contains both isolated pixels, lines, and 2x2 blocks"

        shape: 2x2 block

    transformation: "2x2 green blocks are converted to yellow."

    input_objects:
        - color: 3
          shape: complex
          contiguous: true
          notes: large contiguous object
    output_objects:
        - color: 3
          shape: edges, complex
        - color: 4
          shape: interior, complex
    transformation: "interior green pixels that have four neighbors of the
                      same color are changed to yellow"

  - example: 5
    input_objects:
      - color: 3

        notes: Very large and complex objects
    output_objects:
      - color: 3
        shape: complex, edges
      - color: 4
        shape: complex, interior
    transformation: "interior green pixels of larger objects are changed to yellow"
