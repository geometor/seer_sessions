Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to understand the transformation.

Here's a breakdown of my observations and the deduced transformation rule:


```yaml
facts:
  - grid_size: 7x7
  - input_objects:
    - Two separate azure colored objects.
      - Object 1: A vertical line of length 2 in the second column.
      - Object 2: A mirrored L shape in the 5th and 6th columns.
  - output_objects:
    - The azure objects remain unchanged.
    - A blue pixel appears adjacent to object 1.
    - A blue pixel appears within object 2.
  - color_change:
    - No colors change.
      - New blue pixels are added.
  - relative_positions:
    - Blue pixel inserted between azure pixels in row 2, col 3 (between first object second row and right side edge).
    - Blue pixel inserted between azure pixels in row 5, col 5 (inside L shape).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure-colored objects within the input grid.
2.  **Object 1 Modification:** For the first identified azure object (vertical line), find the row number.
    *   add a single blue pixel between the second element of the object and the right border.
3.  **Object 2 Modification:** For the second identified azure object.
    *    Locate the mirrored L shape.
    *    add blue pixel between the corner and top right adjacent pixels.
4. **Other Pixels:** No transformation is applied to the empty (white) background.

In essence, the transformation identifies azure objects and adds a blue pixel inside of them.

```python
"""

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- You may use code execution to examine the details of the task
- Document facts in a YAML block 
- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.  - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.

remember - your response here will be included in the history of the next
prompt as we move through the process. Be sure to include excellent information
for you future self to solve the task.
