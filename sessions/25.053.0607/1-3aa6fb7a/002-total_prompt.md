Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to understand the transformation.

Here's a breakdown of my observations and the deduced transformation rule:


```yaml
facts:
  - grid_size: 7x7
  - input_objects:
    - Two separate azure colored objects.
      - Object 1: A vertical line of length 2 in the second column.
      - Object 2: A mirrored L shape in the 5th and 6th columns.
  - output_objects:
    - The azure objects remain unchanged.
    - A blue pixel appears adjacent to object 1.
    - A blue pixel appears within object 2.
  - color_change:
    - No colors change.
      - New blue pixels are added.
  - relative_positions:
    - Blue pixel inserted between azure pixels in row 2, col 3 (between first object second row and right side edge).
    - Blue pixel inserted between azure pixels in row 5, col 5 (inside L shape).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure-colored objects within the input grid.
2.  **Object 1 Modification:** For the first identified azure object (vertical line), find the row number.
    *   add a single blue pixel between the second element of the object and the right border.
3.  **Object 2 Modification:** For the second identified azure object.
    *    Locate the mirrored L shape.
    *    add blue pixel between the corner and top right adjacent pixels.
4. **Other Pixels:** No transformation is applied to the empty (white) background.

In essence, the transformation identifies azure objects and adds a blue pixel inside of them.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
