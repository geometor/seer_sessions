Okay, here's a natural language description of the observed transformation, focusing on objects, properties, and actions:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** The transformation begins by identifying all contiguous blocks (objects) of azure (color 8) pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Object-Specific Actions**: The rule seems to add one blue pixel to the "interior" of azure color objects. There are two azure objects in each example, and a slightly different process for each.

3.  **First azure object**: Examine the object, if it is at least 2 pixels tall, add one blue pixel immediately to the right of the second azure pixel from the top.

4.  **Second azure object**: Examine the object and if it is a "mirrored L" shape (two pixels high, and two pixels wide in a mirrored-L configuration), add one blue pixel in the corner of it.

**Summary**
The transformation identifies specific azure-colored shapes and adds a blue pixel adjacent to each one, using a slightly different rule for each.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
