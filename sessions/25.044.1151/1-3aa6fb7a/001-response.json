A neighbor means cells that are located diagonally.\n    *   Upper Left\n    *   Upper Right\n    *   Button Left\n    *   Button Right\n\n3.  **Transformation/Replacement:**\n    If an `8` is found diagonally adjacent to another `8`, change the `8` from the original input to `1`\n\n4.  Copy all values\n\n**In simpler terms:** The rule highlights `8`s that have another `8` diagonally. The highlighted `8` will be changed to `1` in the output.\n\n**Example Application:**\n\n*   In the input, the `8` at position (1,1) does *not* change because the `8` in position (2,2) is adjacent.\n*   In the input, the `8` at position (4,5) changed to `1` because is adjacent with the `8` on his button-right.\n\nThis natural language program captures the essence of the transformation.\n"
