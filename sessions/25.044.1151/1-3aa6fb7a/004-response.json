            "text": "Okay, I understand your request. You've provided a very well-defined natural language program (NLP) that describes how to transform a 2D grid of digits. The core rule is to change '8's to '1's if they have a diagonally adjacent '8', with careful attention to boundary conditions. You've also specified the expected input and output, and provided clear instructions and a template for generating the Python code.\n\nHere's the breakdown of my thought process:\n\n1.  **Understanding the NLP:** I've carefully reread the *revised* NLP. It's crucial to distinguish between input and output grids, handle boundary checks, and correctly identify diagonal neighbors. The \"copy and modify\" strategy is now clear.\n\n2.  **Translating to Code:**  The NLP steps translate directly into Python code:\n    *   **Initialization:**  `output = [row[:] for row in input]` creates a deep copy.\n    *   **Iteration:** Nested loops for rows (`r`) and columns (`c`).\n    *   **Conditionals:** `if input[r][c] == 8:`\n    *   **Neighbor Checking:**  A function to check for valid diagonal neighbors, including boundary checks.\n    *   **Modification:**  `output[r][c] = 1`\n\n3.  **Boundary Check Function:** This is a helper function to keep the main logic clean. It takes the row and column of a potential neighbor and the grid dimensions and returns `True` if the neighbor is within bounds, and `False` otherwise.\n\n4.  **Testing:** The `if __name__ == '__main__'` block is crucial for verification. It allows the code to be run as a script and immediately checks the output against the provided `expected_output`. The assertion provides a clear pass/fail result.\n\n5. **Input and Output Data:** I need the input and expected output grid to implement the code.\n\nNow I will ask the clarifying question for the input and output data.\n\nWhat are the input and output grids represented as a Python list of lists?\n"
