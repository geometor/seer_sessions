Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed changes:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all instances of the digit `8` within the input grid.

2.  **Check for Diagonal Adjacency:**
    For each `8`, we will check the surrounding neighbors. A neighbor means cells that are located diagonally.
    *   Upper Left
    *   Upper Right
    *   Button Left
    *   Button Right

3.  **Transformation/Replacement:**
    If an `8` is found diagonally adjacent to another `8`, change the `8` from the original input to `1`

4.  Copy all values

**In simpler terms:** The rule highlights `8`s that have another `8` diagonally. The highlighted `8` will be changed to `1` in the output.

**Example Application:**

*   In the input, the `8` at position (1,1) does *not* change because the `8` in position (2,2) is adjacent.
*   In the input, the `8` at position (4,5) changed to `1` because is adjacent with the `8` on his button-right.

This natural language program captures the essence of the transformation.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Skeleton Template**

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ allowed imports that support the transform }}

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':
    input = [
        {{ Input grid rows }}
    ]

    expected_output = [
        {{ expected output grid rows }}
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("[bold green]SUCCESS![/]")
    else:
        print("[bold red]FAILED![/]")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
