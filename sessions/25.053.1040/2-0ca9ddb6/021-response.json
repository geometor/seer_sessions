            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly implements the core concept of expanding white pixels based on neighboring colors. However, it exhibits a few key errors:\n\n1.  **Expansion Order Dependence:** The current code expands based on the *first* matching neighbor (red or blue). This causes inconsistencies because the order of neighbor checking (up, down, left, right) influences the output. Some expansions that *should* happen are missed.\n2.  **Incorrect Propagation:** The code applies the transformation based on the original grid, and stops the current pixel from changing after the first color conversion, but this may not allow changes to \"propagate\" correctly through the white areas, as the changed white pixels won't be checked again.\n3. No consideration for adjacent same-color pixels that should prevent expansion.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Iterative Expansion:** Instead of a single pass, we need an iterative approach. After changing a white pixel to yellow or orange, we need to re-evaluate its neighbors in subsequent iterations. This will allow the \"expansion\" to spread correctly.\n2.  **Prioritize Expansion Rules:** Use the full set of neighbors to determine if the expansion rule should be applied. Do not stop evaluating the current pixel after applying only the first rule.\n3.  **Prevent expansions:** into non-white pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary of each example, highlighting the specific issues:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   The expansion from red (2) and blue (1) works in some areas, but not all.\n    *   The problem: order dependency. The top-left white pixel next to the '2' changes to '4', but white pixels to its right remain '0'.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Similar order-dependency issues as Example 1, plus interactions between the expansions originating from '1' and '2'.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Same problems as the others, demonstrating that the issue isn't specific to a particular layout.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: grid\n    properties:\n      - dimensions: variable (rows x cols)\n      - cells: contain integer values 0-9 representing colors\n  - object: pixel\n    properties:\n      - color: integer value (0-9)\n      - position: (row, col) index\n      - neighbors: up to 4 adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right)\n  - action: expansion\n    description: White pixels change color based on neighboring non-white pixels.\n    rules:\n      - condition: neighbor is red (2)\n        result: white pixel becomes yellow (4)\n      - condition: neighbor is blue (1)\n        result: white pixel becomes orange (7)\n      - condition: neighbor is magenta (6)\n        result: no change\n      - condition: neighbor is any color other than 0, 1, 2, or 6\n        result: no change\n      - condition: white pixel is next to same color.\n        result: no change\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Copy Grid:** Create a copy of the input grid. This copy will be modified to become the output grid.\n2.  **Iterative Expansion:** Repeat the following steps until no more changes occur:\n    *   Iterate through each cell of the *output* grid.\n    *   For each *white* (0) pixel:\n        *   Examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right).\n        *   If any neighbor is red (2), change the white pixel to yellow (4).\n        *   If any neighbor is blue (1), change the white pixel to orange (7).\n        *   If a neighbor is not 0, 1, 2, or 6, it will not propagate an expansion\n        *   If all neighbors are 0 or the colors of the transformation, do not perform the expansion.\n3.  **Output:** The modified copy of the grid is the final output. The key improvement is iterative expansion which continues until no more white pixels can be changed.\n\n"
