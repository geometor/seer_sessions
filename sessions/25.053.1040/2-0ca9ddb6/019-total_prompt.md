Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify original objects**: Find all contiguous non-white pixels in the input grid. These are the original colored objects.
2.  **Determine expansion colors**:
    *   If an original object is red (2), add adjacent pixels colored yellow (4).
    *   If an original object is blue (1), add adjacent pixels colored orange (7).
    *   If an original object is magenta (6) add adjacent pixels, but they will have yellow and orange nearby, so they will not be extended
3.  **Expand objects**: For each original colored object:
    *   For each pixel in the original object, check its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).
    *   If a neighbor is white (0), change it to the designated expansion color based on the original pixel's color. Do *not* extend diagonally.
4. output the final grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
