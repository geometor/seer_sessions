# Example

**input:**
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x751433B1F2B0>

**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains single pixels of various colors (blue, red, azure) scattered within a background of white (0) pixels. The output grid introduces new colors (orange, yellow) and seems to expand or connect some of the original colored pixels. Notably, the azure (8) pixel in the top row of the input remains unchanged. There appears to be a relationship between the blue (1) and red (2) pixels in the input and the newly introduced orange (7) and yellow (4) pixels in the output. The relationship seems positional, involving mirroring and possibly some form of interaction or combination.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      width: 9
      height: 9
      background_color: white (0)

  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - blue (1)
        - red (2)
        - azure (8)
        - orange (7)
        - yellow (4)
      position:
        - row: int
        - column: int

  - observation: azure_pixel_unchanged
    details: "The azure (8) pixel at position (0, 3) remains unchanged in the output."

  - observation: blue_red_interaction
    details: "Blue (1) and red (2) pixels in the input seem to relate to orange (7) and yellow (4) pixels in the output."

  - observation: positional_transformation
    details: "The transformation involves changes in pixel positions and colors, possibly mirroring or reflection."

  - observation: potential_combination
    details: "New colors might be the result of some form of combination or interaction between the original colors."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not white (0). These are our key pixels.
2.  **Preserve Azure:** If an azure (8) pixel is present, copy it directly to the output grid at the same position.
3. **Mirror/reflection rule for Blue (1):** For each blue pixel.
   - Create a new orange pixel with value 7 to the right and at left of the original blue pixel
   - Create two new orange pixels with value 7 mirrored vertically with same horizontal shift

4.  **Mirror/reflection rule for Red (2):** For each red pixel.
   - Create a new yellow pixel with value 4 above and under of the original blue pixel
   - Create two new yellow pixels with value 4 mirrored horizontally with same vertical shift

This program describes a combination of preservation (for azure) and a complex mirroring/reflection rule for other colors. The colors transform according to this schema: 1->7 and 2->4.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
