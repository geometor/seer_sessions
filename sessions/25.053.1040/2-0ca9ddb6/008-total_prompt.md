"""
1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all red (2) and blue (1) pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Create Yellow Surrounds:** For each red pixel, create a 2x2 square of yellow (4) pixels. The 2x2 square *contains* the red pixel but is *not* centered on it. The red pixel will be in the bottom right of the surrounding box.

3.  **Create Orange Surrounds:** For each blue pixel, create a 3x3 square of orange (7) pixels. The blue pixel *is* at the center of this 3x3 square.

4.  **Background Preservation:** All other pixels that are not part of a created surround should remain unchanged (value 0/white in these examples). The output grid only contains values of 0, 4, and 7.

5. **Output:** The output is the modified grid.

Here's an assessment of the provided information, error analysis, and updated program description:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code have a fundamental flaw in how they interpret the positioning of the surrounding boxes relative to the target pixels (red and blue). The code places the yellow box *starting* at the red pixel's top-left corner, effectively making the red pixel the top-left of the yellow square, not the bottom-right.  Similarly, while the orange box is correctly sized (3x3), the placement is off, it isn't *centered* on the blue pixel, but instead starts with the blue pixel in the top-left, making the blue pixel the top-left of this surrounding square. The code also doesn't preserve non-modified background. The current strategy is to create new arrays of the same dimensions, and only fill cells that should change; all other cells retain the default value of zero.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Correct Relative Positioning:** Modify the surround creation logic to correctly position the colored boxes. For the yellow box (red pixel), adjust the loop indices to ensure the red pixel ends up in the bottom-right corner. For the orange box (blue pixel), adjust the loop indices to place the blue pixel at the center of the 3x3 orange box.

2.  **No change to Background:** Confirm that the initialized `output_grid` will default to `0`, and no operations change a pixel's color unless the color will be either `4` or `7`.

**Metrics and Error Analysis:**

I will use print statements with numpy to create reports about the data to confirm my assumptions about the errors. I am assuming:

1. the sizes of the transformed output and expected output are the same
2. that the colors used in the transformed output are correct
3. the locations of pixels where input == output are consistent.

Because all examples passed #1 and #2, these assumptions are correct, and there is no additional insight provided by those tests, so I will focus on assumption #3.

These pixel counts are consistent with shifting the 2x2 and 3x3 shapes.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: red_pixel
    color: red
    value: 2
    action: create_yellow_surround

  - name: blue_pixel
    color: blue

    value: 7
    shape: 3x3 square
    relative_position:

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid filled with zeros (white), having the same dimensions as the input grid.

2.  **Red Pixel Processing:** Locate each red (value 2) pixel in the input grid. For each red pixel, create a 2x2 square of yellow (value 4) pixels.  The red pixel should be located in the *bottom-right* corner of this yellow square.

3.  **Blue Pixel Processing:** Locate each blue (value 1) pixel in the input grid. For each blue pixel, create a 3x3 square of orange (value 7) pixels. The blue pixel should be located at the *center* of this orange square.

4.  **Output:** The output is the modified grid, containing only values 0, 4, and 7, where all pixels that are not part of a yellow or orange surround have the value 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
