Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, where each pixel has a color represented by a digit (0-9). The input grid appears to have two distinct colored pixels (red '2' and blue '1') against a background of white ('0') pixels. The output grid introduces two new colors: yellow ('4') and orange ('7'). The positions of the original colored pixels seem to influence the placement and pattern of the new colored pixels. Specifically, the yellow pixels appear around the red pixel, and the orange pixels surround the blue pixel.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - width: 9
      - height: 9
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - object: red_pixel
    color: red (2)
    initial_position: (2,2) # (row, column) - zero indexed
    action: surrounded by yellow (4)

  - object: blue_pixel
    color: blue (1)
    initial_position: (6,6)
    action: surrounded by orange (7)

  - object: yellow_pixels
    color: yellow (4)
    pattern: forms a 2x2 square

  - object: orange_pixels
     color: orange(7)
     pattern: forms a 3x3 square with blue at the center

  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    action: remains unchanged, except where replaced
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the red pixel (value '2') and the blue pixel (value '1') within the input grid.

2.  **Create Yellow Surround:** For the red pixel, replace the four pixels that share edges with it with the color yellow (value '4'). Ensure that the newly formed yellow area becomes a 2 X 2 box with one corner as the red pixel.

3.  **Create Orange Surround:** For the blue pixel, replace the eight pixels surrounding it (including diagonals) with the color orange (value '7'). Ensure that the newly formed orange color occupies a 3 X 3 box and the blue pixel is at the center.

4.  **Preserve Background:** All other pixels in the grid that are not part of the above transformations should remain unchanged (retain their original color, which is white '0').

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
