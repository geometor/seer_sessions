The input grid contains single pixels of various colors (blue, red, azure) scattered within a background of white (0) pixels. The output grid introduces new colors (orange, yellow) and seems to expand or connect some of the original colored pixels. Notably, the azure (8) pixel in the top row of the input remains unchanged. There appears to be a relationship between the blue (1) and red (2) pixels in the input and the newly introduced orange (7) and yellow (4) pixels in the output. The relationship seems positional, involving mirroring and possibly some form of interaction or combination.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The colors transform according to this schema: 1->7 and 2->4.\n\n"
