            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt but failed to perfectly transform all input examples to their expected outputs. The primary issue lies in how the transformation handles the placement of surrounding colors. It appears to \"overwrite\" previously placed colors, especially in cases where the influence of red (2) and blue (1) pixels overlap. The strategy should be to modify the output in a non destructive way.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Focus on the discrepancies between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` for each example. Specifically note the coordinates where incorrect color placements occur and trace them back to the input pixel that triggered them.\n2.  **Refine Placement Logic:** The natural language program needs a clearer understanding of the interaction, or potential conflict, between colors to make it work. The code needs to place adjacent colors *only* if the target cell is currently black (0).\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the errors:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Errors:** The orange (7) pixels surrounding the blue (1) are overwriting each other on row 2 and 4, col 2, leaving a black instead of an orange. The same is true for the yellow pixels.\n    *   **Observation:** Overlapping influence from blue and red pixels needs to be addressed.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Errors:** Similar overwriting issues as in Example 1, plus further complications due to the presence of a blue pixel (1) and two red pixels (2).\n    *   **Observation:** Confirm that overwriting is the core problem, and interactions are creating the wrong colors.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Errors:** Same type of problem as examples 1 & 2.\n    *   **Observation:** The magenta (6) is copied correctly, which validates the first part of the current logic.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 012\nfacts:\n  - object: blue_pixel\n    color: 1\n    action: surround_with_orange\n  - object: red_pixel\n    color: 2\n    action: surround_with_yellow\n  - object: azure_pixel\n    color: 8\n    action: copy\n  - object: magenta_pixel\n    color: 6\n    action: copy\n  - object: orange_pixel\n    color: 7\n    placement: adjacent_to_blue\n  - object: yellow_pixel\n    color: 4\n    placement: adjacent_to_red\n  - rule: \"Adjacent placement should not overwrite existing non-zero pixels.\"\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Copy Unchanged:** If an azure (8) or magenta (6) pixel is present in the input, copy it directly to the output grid at the same position.\n2.  **Blue Pixel (1) Transformation:** For each blue pixel:\n    *   Place an orange (7) pixel immediately to its left, right, above and below, *only if the target cell is currently black/empty (0)*.\n3.  **Red Pixel (2) Transformation:** For each red pixel:\n    *   Place a yellow (4) pixel immediately to its left, right, above, and below, *only if the target cell is currently black/empty (0)*.\n4. **Ignore other colors**: All other colors in the grid should be ignored.\n\nThe critical addition here is the conditional placement, ensuring that colors are only added to empty (black, 0) cells, preventing overwriting and preserving the intended surrounding effect.\n"
