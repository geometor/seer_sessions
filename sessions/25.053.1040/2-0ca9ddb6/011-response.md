Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program captures the basic idea of mirroring/reflection, but it's not precise enough. The generated outputs show errors in the positioning of the mirrored pixels, especially concerning their adjacency to the original pixels. The code is creating extra mirrored pixels or placing in the wrong location. The strategy is to modify the existing approach by focusing on *relative* transformations and ensure the placement of mirrored pixels is correctly specified. We also need to ignore colors that are not part of the transformation.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Adjacency:** Instead of simply checking bounds, explicitly calculate the target positions for mirrored pixels based on the *relative* position of the original pixel. This is crucial.
2.  **Conditional mirroring,** improve accuracy by determining conditions.
3.  **Ignore additional colors** Magenta (6) pixels should be ignored/copied.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

Here's a summary of the results:

| Example | Match | Pixels Off | Size Correct | Palette Correct | Pixel Counts Correct | Notes                                                                                                                                           |
| :------ | :---- | :--------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | False | 8          | True         | True            | False                | Incorrect placement of mirrored orange and yellow pixels. Extra orange pixels on edges, extra yellow pixels on corners.                        |
| 2       | False | 16         | True         | True            | False                | Incorrect placement of mirrored orange and yellow pixels. Orange and yellow pixels mirrored on corners.                                              |
| 3       | False | 8          | True         | True            | False                | Incorrect placement of mirrored orange pixels, extra orange pixels mirrored on corners. Magenta (6) is correctly copied.                 |

**YAML Block - Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_pixel
    color: 1
    actions:
      - type: mirror_horizontal
        new_color: 7
      - type: mirror_vertical
        new_color: 7
  - name: red_pixel
    color: 2
    actions:
      - type: mirror_horizontal
        new_color: 4
      - type: mirror_vertical
        new_color: 4
  - name: azure_pixel
    color: 8
    actions:
      - type: copy
  - name: magenta_pixel
    color: 6
    actions:
      - type: copy

transformations:
    - copy_colors: [8, 6]
    - source: 1 # blue
      target: 7 # orange
      rule: |-
          place one pixel left and right
          place one pixel above and below
    - source: 2 # red
      target: 4 # yellow
      rule: |-
          place one pixel above and below
          place one pixel left and right
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy Unchanged:** If an azure (8) or magenta (6) pixel is present in the input, copy it directly to the output grid at the same position.
2.  **Blue Pixel (1) Transformation:** For each blue pixel:
    *   Place an orange (7) pixel immediately to its left and right.
    *   Place an orange (7) pixel immediately above and below.
3.  **Red Pixel (2) Transformation:** For each red pixel:
    *   Place a yellow (4) pixel immediately above and below.
    *  Place a yellow (4) pixel immediately to its left and right.
4. **Ignore other colors**: all other colors in the grid should be ignored.

The key improvement here is the emphasis on *immediate* adjacency for the mirrored pixels. This should eliminate the errors seen in the previous outputs.
