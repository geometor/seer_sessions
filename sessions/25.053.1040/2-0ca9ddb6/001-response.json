The input grid appears to have two distinct colored pixels (red '2' and blue '1') against a background of white ('0') pixels. The output grid introduces two new colors: yellow ('4') and orange ('7'). The positions of the original colored pixels seem to influence the placement and pattern of the new colored pixels. Specifically, the yellow pixels appear around the red pixel, and the orange pixels surround the blue pixel.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Ensure that the newly formed yellow area becomes a 2 X 2 box with one corner as the red pixel.\n\n3.  **Create Orange Surround:** For the blue pixel, replace the eight pixels surrounding it (including diagonals) with the color orange (value '7'). Ensure that the newly formed orange color occupies a 3 X 3 box and the blue pixel is at the center.\n\n4.  **Preserve Background:** All other pixels in the grid that are not part of the above transformations should remain unchanged (retain their original color, which is white '0').\n"
