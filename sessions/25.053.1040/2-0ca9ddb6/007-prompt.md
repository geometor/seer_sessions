Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all red (2) and blue (1) pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Create Yellow Surrounds:** For each red pixel, create a 2x2 square of yellow (4) pixels. The 2x2 square *contains* the red pixel but is *not* centered on it. The red pixel will be in the bottom right of the surrounding box.

3.  **Create Orange Surrounds:** For each blue pixel, create a 3x3 square of orange (7) pixels. The blue pixel *is* at the center of this 3x3 square.

4.  **Background Preservation:** All other pixels that are not part of a created surround should remain unchanged (value 0/white in these examples). The output grid only contains values of 0, 4, and 7.

5. **Output:** The output is the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
