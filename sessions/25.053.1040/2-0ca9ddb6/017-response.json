The transformation seems to involve adding new colored pixels (yellow, orange) adjacent to the existing ones, creating a sort of \"halo\" or \"expansion\" effect. The shape and size of the original colored pixels are maintained, and the expansion seems to be limited to immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right, but not diagonal).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
