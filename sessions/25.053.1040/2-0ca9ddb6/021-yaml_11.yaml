facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x cols)
      - cells: contain integer values 0-9 representing colors
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9)
      - position: (row, col) index

  - action: expansion
    description: White pixels change color based on neighboring non-white pixels.
    rules:
      - condition: neighbor is red (2)
        result: white pixel becomes yellow (4)
      - condition: neighbor is blue (1)
        result: white pixel becomes orange (7)
      - condition: neighbor is magenta (6)
        result: no change
      - condition: neighbor is any color other than 0, 1, 2, or 6
        result: no change
      - condition: white pixel is next to same color.
        result: no change
