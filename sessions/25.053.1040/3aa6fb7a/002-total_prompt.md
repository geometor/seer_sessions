# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0

```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x751433B1EEC0>

**output:**
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, where each pixel has a numerical value representing a color. The primary color observed is '0' (white) and '8' (azure). The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some of the '8' (azure) pixels to '1' (blue). The positions of the changed pixels appear significant.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - rows: 7
      - columns: 7
      - cell_values: integers (0-9)
  - object: pixel
    description: individual cell in the grid
    properties:
      - color: represented by an integer
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
  - observation: color_change
    description: Some azure (8) pixels change to blue (1).
    details:
      - from_color: 8
      - to_color: 1
  - spatial_relation: adjacency
    description: the relative postion of the azure and changed blue pixels
    details: >
      examining the four azure pixels on the left, the one which has another
      azure pixel diagonally down and to the right becomes a blue pixel, and for the two on the
      right, the one with an azure pixel diagonally up and to the left.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all pixels with the value '8' (azure) within the input grid.
2.  **Evaluate Adjacency:** For each azure pixel, check for diagonal adjacency:
    *   specifically, if the top left 2x2 subgrid matches either of these patterns:
        *   8s in the top-left and bottom-right, 1 is placed in top-left
        *   8s in the top-right and bottom-left, 1 is placed in bottom-right

3.  **Transform:**
    *   if an azure pixel has another azure pixel located diagonally down and to the right, change the first pixel's value to '1' (blue).
    *   if an azure pixel has another azure pixel located diagonally up and to the left, change the second pixel's value to '1' (blue)
4.  **Output:** Produce the modified grid, where the identified azure pixels have been changed to blue, and all other pixels remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
