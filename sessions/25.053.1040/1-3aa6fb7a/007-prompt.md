Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Scan:** Examine the input grid in 2x2 subgrids, moving across rows and then down columns.
2.  **Identify:** Within each 2x2 subgrid, check for diagonal pairs of azure (8) pixels.
3.  **Transform (Corrected Rule):**
    *   If the top-left and bottom-right pixels of the 2x2 subgrid are both azure (8), change the *bottom-right* pixel to blue (1).
    *   If the top-right and bottom-left pixels of the 2x2 subgrid are both azure (8), change the *top-right* pixel to blue (1).
4.  **Output:** The modified grid after processing all 2x2 subgrids.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
