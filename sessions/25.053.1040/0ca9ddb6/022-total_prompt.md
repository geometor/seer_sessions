"""
1.  **Identify Original Colored Pixels:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid. Note the color and position of any non-white pixels.
2.  **Preserve Original Colors:** The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid.  This ensures all original non-white pixels are maintained.
3.  **Conditional Expansion:** For each *white* (0) pixel in the output grid:
    *   Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right, but *not* diagonally).
    *   If a neighbor is red (2), change the white pixel to yellow (4).
    *   If a neighbor is blue (1), change the white pixel to orange (7).
    *   If a neighbor is magenta(6) do nothing.
4. Output the final grid

Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly implements the core concept of expanding white pixels based on neighboring colors. However, it exhibits a few key errors:

1.  **Expansion Order Dependence:** The current code expands based on the *first* matching neighbor (red or blue). This causes inconsistencies because the order of neighbor checking (up, down, left, right) influences the output. Some expansions that *should* happen are missed.
2.  **Incorrect Propagation:** The code applies the transformation based on the original grid, and stops the current pixel from changing after the first color conversion, but this may not allow changes to "propagate" correctly through the white areas, as the changed white pixels won't be checked again.
3. No consideration for adjacent same-color pixels that should prevent expansion.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Iterative Expansion:** Instead of a single pass, we need an iterative approach. After changing a white pixel to yellow or orange, we need to re-evaluate its neighbors in subsequent iterations. This will allow the "expansion" to spread correctly.
2.  **Prioritize Expansion Rules:** Use the full set of neighbors to determine if the expansion rule should be applied. Do not stop evaluating the current pixel after applying only the first rule.
3.  **Prevent expansions:** into non-white pixels.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a summary of each example, highlighting the specific issues:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   The expansion from red (2) and blue (1) works in some areas, but not all.
    *   The problem: order dependency. The top-left white pixel next to the '2' changes to '4', but white pixels to its right remain '0'.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Similar order-dependency issues as Example 1, plus interactions between the expansions originating from '1' and '2'.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Same problems as the others, demonstrating that the issue isn't specific to a particular layout.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x cols)
      - cells: contain integer values 0-9 representing colors
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9)
      - position: (row, col) index
      - neighbors: up to 4 adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right)
  - action: expansion
    description: White pixels change color based on neighboring non-white pixels.
    rules:
      - condition: neighbor is red (2)
        result: white pixel becomes yellow (4)
      - condition: neighbor is blue (1)
        result: white pixel becomes orange (7)
      - condition: neighbor is magenta (6)
        result: no change
      - condition: neighbor is any color other than 0, 1, 2, or 6
        result: no change
      - condition: white pixel is next to same color.
        result: no change
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy Grid:** Create a copy of the input grid. This copy will be modified to become the output grid.
2.  **Iterative Expansion:** Repeat the following steps until no more changes occur:
    *   Iterate through each cell of the *output* grid.
    *   For each *white* (0) pixel:
        *   Examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right).
        *   If any neighbor is red (2), change the white pixel to yellow (4).
        *   If any neighbor is blue (1), change the white pixel to orange (7).
        *   If a neighbor is not 0, 1, 2, or 6, it will not propagate an expansion
        *   If all neighbors are 0 or the colors of the transformation, do not perform the expansion.
3.  **Output:** The modified copy of the grid is the final output. The key improvement is iterative expansion which continues until no more white pixels can be changed.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
