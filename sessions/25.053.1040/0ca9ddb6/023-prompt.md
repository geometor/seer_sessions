Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Copy Grid:** Create a copy of the input grid. This copy will be modified to become the output grid.
2.  **Iterative Expansion:** Repeat the following steps until no more changes occur:
    *   Iterate through each cell of the *output* grid.
    *   For each *white* (0) pixel:
        *   Examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right).
        *   If any neighbor is red (2), change the white pixel to yellow (4).
        *   If any neighbor is blue (1), change the white pixel to orange (7).
        *   If a neighbor is not 0, 1, 2, or 6, it will not propagate an expansion
        *   If all neighbors are 0 or the colors of the transformation, do not perform the expansion.
3.  **Output:** The modified copy of the grid is the final output. The key improvement is iterative expansion which continues until no more white pixels can be changed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
