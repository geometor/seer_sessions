Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Original Colored Pixels:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid. Note the color and position of any non-white pixels.
2.  **Preserve Original Colors:** The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid.  This ensures all original non-white pixels are maintained.
3.  **Conditional Expansion:** For each *white* (0) pixel in the output grid:
    *   Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right, but *not* diagonally).
    *   If a neighbor is red (2), change the white pixel to yellow (4).
    *   If a neighbor is blue (1), change the white pixel to orange (7).
    *   If a neighbor is magenta(6) do nothing.
4. Output the final grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
