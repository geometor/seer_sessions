# Example

**input:**
```
0 4 0 9
0 0 0 0
0 4 6 0
1 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x751433B1F2B0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 4 0 0
1 4 6 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x751433B1F070>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 4x4 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 4x4 grid. The most obvious change is the rearrangement of certain non-zero colored pixels. Some zero-valued (white) pixels remain unchanged, acting seemingly as padding or background. The non-zero pixels appear to maintain their original values (colors), but their positions are altered. The relationship between the input and output position of each color is what needs to be discovered.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      value: integer (0-9)  # Represents color
      position: (row, column) # (x, y) coordinates

actions:
  - name: rearrange
    description: Move pixels to new positions within the grid.
    constraints:
      - original_value_preserved: true
      
relationships:
   - type: spatial
     description: Pixels maintain original color, and the colored pixels are moved to the last row, preserving the original order from top-left to bottom right input order.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that have a value other than 0.

2.  **Preserve Order:** Maintain these non-zero pixels in the order they appear in the input reading from top-left, to bottom-right, left to right in each row, and top to bottom by rows.

3.  **Place to last row** Place the ordered non-zero pixels in the last row of the output grid, starting from the leftmost cell and filling towards the right.

4. **Fill Remaining**: Fill the remaining cells in the output grid (those not occupied by the rearranged non-zero pixels) with 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
