The most obvious change is the rearrangement of certain non-zero colored pixels. Some zero-valued (white) pixels remain unchanged, acting seemingly as padding or background. The non-zero pixels appear to maintain their original values (colors), but their positions are altered. The relationship between the input and output position of each color is what needs to be discovered.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
