The first is at the top-left, and the second is at the bottom-right.\n\n2.  **Detect Change**: We observe that the azure objects maintain their shape and position. However, the blue color (1) occupies the rightmost cell of each L-shape's top segment.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    -   Locate the two azure L-shaped objects.\n    -   Paint with blue the cell located directly to the right of the azure cell in the top row of each of the two shapes.\n\nIn summary: Find L shapes, locate cells next to their top part, and paint in a different color.\n"
