            "text": "*Background Color* for Example 1 is 9 (maroon).\n*Key Column*: 1\n*Source Column*: 8\n*Target Column 1*: 3\n*Target Column 2*: 15\n*Output Grid*: Start as copy of Input.\n\nLet's trace Example 1 rows with the refined logic:\n*   **Row 0**: Key=9, Source=9. Key == Source. Rule: Output[0, 3]=Source(9), Output[0, 8]=Background(9).\n    *   Result: `[9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9]` (Row 0 is unchanged).\n    *   Expected Output Row 0: `[9 9 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 9 9 2 9 5 9 9]`.\n    *   **Mismatch!** The logic derived from Example 2 does not work for Example 1.\n\n**Hypothesis Revision:**\nThe core issue might be how the \"background\" color is determined or used, or the columns involved might differ between examples. Or maybe the rule isn't row-independent.\n\nLet's re-examine Example 1's Input vs Output carefully, considering the *whole grid*.\nInput: Maroon frame (9), white frame (0) below. Objects in rows 3 and 8.\nOutput: Maroon/white frames same. Objects *appear* in row 0 and 6. Row 3 has a pixel changed to maroon (9). Row 8 is unchanged.\n\nCompare Row 0 Output `[9 9 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 9 9 2 9 5 9 9]` with Row 8 Input `[0 5 9 5 9 3 9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 0]`.\n*   Output[0, 3] = 3. Input[8, 5] = 3, Input[8, 9] = 3.\n*   Output[0, 5] = 5. Input[8, 1] = 5, Input[8, 3] = 5, Input[8, 7] = 5, Input[8, 11] = 5.\n*   Output[0, 7] = 2. Input[8, 13] = 2.\n*   Output[0, 11] = 2. Input[8, 13] = 2.\n*   Output[0, 13] = 5. (See above)\n\nIt seems like pixels from Input Row 8 are being copied to Output Row 0. But how is the mapping determined?\n*   Input[8, 1] (5) -> Output[0, 5] ?\n*   Input[8, 3] (5) -> Output[0, 5] or Output[0, 13] ?\n*   Input[8, 5] (3) -> Output[0, 3] ?\n*   Input[8, 7] (5) -> Output[0, 5] or Output[0, 13] ?\n*   Input[8, 9] (3) -> Output[0, 3] ?\n*   Input[8, 11] (5) -> Output[0, 5] or Output[0, 13] ?\n*   Input[8, 13] (2) -> Output[0, 7] or Output[0, 11] ?\n\nThis is not a direct column mapping. What about Row 3?\nInput Row 3: `[9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 3 9 2 9 5 9 9]`\nOutput Row 3: `[9 5 9 9 9 5 9 2 9 3 9 2 9 5 9 9]`\nChange: Input[3, 3] (green, 3) becomes Output[3, 3] (maroon, 9). Maroon is the background color in the top half.\n\nWhat about Row 6?\nInput Row 6: `[9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9]`\nOutput Row 6: `[9 5 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 3 9 9 9 9 9 9]`\nWhere do 5 and 3 come from?\nCompare Output Row 6 with Input Row 3: `[9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 3 9 2 9 5 9 9]`\n*   Output[6, 1] = 5. Input[3, 1] = 5.\n*   Output[6, 9] = 3. Input[3, 9] = 3.\nThis looks like a direct copy based on column index from Input Row 3 to Output Row 6.\n\n**New Hypothesis (Example 1):**\n1.  Pixels from Input Row 3 at column `c` are copied to Output Row 6 at column `c`? No, only columns 1 and 9 are copied. Why those?\n2.  Pixels from Input Row 8 are copied to Output Row 0? Seems plausible but the mapping is unclear.\n3.  Input Row 3, Column 3 changes from 3 to 9. Why?\n\nLet's reconsider the structure. There are two blocks of rows separated by white (0). Top block (rows 0-6, bg=9), bottom block (rows 8-15, bg=0). Row 7 is the separator.\nMaybe actions depend on which block a row is in?\n\nLet's look at the \"key\" column (1) and \"source\" column (8) again for Example 1.\n*   Row 0: Key=9, Src=9. Output changes based on Row 8.\n*   Row 1: Key=9, Src=9. Output unchanged.\n*   Row 2: Key=9, Src=9. Output unchanged.\n*   Row 3: Key=5, Src=9. Output changes at [3,3] (Input 3 -> Output 9).\n*   Row 4: Key=9, Src=9. Output unchanged.\n*   Row 5: Key=9, Src=9. Output unchanged.\n*   Row 6: Key=9, Src=9. Output changes based on Row 3.\n*   Row 8: Key=5, Src=9. Output unchanged.\n*   Row 9: Key=9, Src=9. Output unchanged.\n...\n\nThis is confusing. Why does Row 0 depend on Row 8, and Row 6 depend on Row 3?\nWhat's special about rows 0, 3, 6, 8?\n0 = 0*3\n3 = 1*3\n6 = 2*3\n8? Doesn't fit the pattern.\n\nIs it about the *content* of the key/source columns?\nRows where Key != Background (9 or 0) and Source != Background:\n*   Row 3: Key=5, Source=9 (Background). Output changes at [3,3]. Row 6 also changes.\n*   Row 8: Key=5, Source=9 (Not background here, bg=0). Output unchanged. Row 0 also changes.\n\nMaybe the rule involves comparing Key (col 1) and Source (col 8).\nLet `k = input[r, 1]` and `s = input[r, 8]`.\nLet `bg_upper = 9`, `bg_lower = 0`.\nDefine `is_upper = (r <= 6)`. `bg = bg_upper if is_upper else bg_lower`.\n\n*   Row 0: r=0, is_upper=T, bg=9. k=9, s=9. k==bg, s==bg. Output[0] gets values from Input[8].\n*   Row 3: r=3, is_upper=T, bg=9. k=5, s=9. k!=bg, s==bg. Output[3,3] becomes bg (9).\n*   Row 6: r=6, is_upper=T, bg=9. k=9, s=9. k==bg, s==bg. Output[6] gets values from Input[3].\n*   Row 8: r=8, is_upper=F, bg=0. k=5, s=9. k!=bg, s!=bg. Output[8] is unchanged.\n\nThis suggests something like:\nIf k == bg AND s == bg:\n  If r == 0, copy select cells from row 8?\n  If r == 6, copy select cells from row 3?\nIf k != bg AND s == bg (only row 3):\n  Change cell [3,3] to bg? Why [3,3]? Input[3,3] is 3. Input[3,9] is also 3. Why only [3,3]?\nIf k != bg AND s != bg (only row 8):\n  No change?\n\nThis seems too specific and complex for Example 1. Let's revisit Example 2 with this \"background\" idea.\nBackground = 7.\nKey=col 1, Source=col 8. Target1=col 3, Target2=col 15.\nRule: If k == s OR k == bg (7), Output[r, 3] = s. Else Output[r, 15] = s. Always Output[r, 8] = bg (7).\n\nThis rule worked perfectly for Example 2. Why did it fail Example 1?\nMaybe the background calculation was wrong? No, 9 is clearly the most frequent.\nMaybe the columns are different?\nWhat if the columns are relative? E.g., \"first non-background column\", \"eighth non-background column\"? No, columns 1 and 8 seem fixed.\n\nCould the issue be the \"replace source column with background\" part?\nLet's try the Example 2 logic *without* modifying column 8.\nRule: If k == s OR k == bg, Output[r, 3] = s. Else Output[r, 15] = s. Leave Output[r, 8] as Input[r, 8]. All other cells unchanged.\n\nApply to Example 1:\n*   Background = 9.\n*   Row 0: k=9, s=9. k==s. Rule: Output[0, 3] = 9.\n    *   Result: `[9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9]`\n    *   Expected: `[9 9 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 9 9 2 9 5 9 9]` - Still incorrect.\n*   Row 3: k=5, s=9. k!=s, k!=bg. Rule: Output[3, 15] = 9.\n    *   Result: `[9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 3 9 2 9 5 9 9]` (Input row 3 with Output[3, 15] set to 9).\n    *   Expected: `[9 5 9 9 9 5 9 2 9 3 9 2 9 5 9 9]` - Still incorrect (change at [3,3]).\n*   Row 8: k=5, s=9. Bg=0. k!=s, k!=bg. Rule: Output[8, 15] = 9.\n    *   Result: `[0 5 9 5 9 3 9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 9]`\n    *   Expected: `[0 5 9 5 9 3 9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 0]` - Still incorrect.\n\nThe logic derived from Example 2 simply doesn't work for Example 1. This implies the two examples follow different rules, or there's a more general rule that simplifies to the observed Example 2 behaviour under specific conditions.\n\nWhat if the background is NOT the most frequent color?\nExample 1: Input has frames of 9 and 0. Maybe these are ignored? Colors inside are 2, 3, 5. Most frequent *inside* is 5 (7 times). If bg=5?\n*   Row 3: k=5, s=9. k==bg. Rule: Output[3, 3]=9. Replace Output[3, 8]=5 (bg).\n    *   Result: `...[1]=5...[3]=9...[8]=5...`\n*   Row 8: k=5, s=9. k==bg. Rule: Output[8, 3]=9. Replace Output[8, 8]=5 (bg).\n    *   Result: `...[1]=5...[3]=9...[8]=5...`\nThis doesn't match either.\n\nExample 2: Input has frames of 4 and 7. Colors inside are 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. Most frequent is 1 (4 times) or 8 (4 times). Let's stick with 7 as background.\n\nLet's assume the core logic involves columns 1, 8, 3, 15 and comparison between col 1 and col 8.\n\nMaybe the \"background\" comparison is wrong.\nRule: If `key == source`, copy `source` to col 3. Else, copy `source` to col 15. Replace `source` pixel at col 8 with background.\n\nApply to Example 1 (bg=9):\n*   Row 0: k=9, s=9. k==s. Output[0,3]=9, Output[0,8]=9. Result: Unchanged. Incorrect.\n*   Row 3: k=5, s=9. k!=s. Output[3,15]=9, Output[3,8]=9. Result: `[9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 3 9 2 9 5 9 9]`. Incorrect.\n*   Row 8: k=5, s=9. k!=s. Output[8,15]=9, Output[8,8]=0 (bg=0 here). Result: `[0 5 9 5 9 3 9 5 0 3 9 5 9 2 9 9]`. Incorrect.\n\nApply to Example 2 (bg=7):\n*   Row 1: k=1, s=8. k!=s. Output[1,15]=8, Output[1,8]=7. Result: `...[8]=7...[15]=8`. Correct.\n*   Row 7: k=1, s=1. k==s. Output[7,3]=1, Output[7,8]=7. Result: `...[3]=1...[8]=7`. Correct.\n*   Row 9: k=8, s=8. k==s. Output[9,3]=8, Output[9,8]=7. Result: `...[3]=8...[8]=7`. Correct.\n\nThis simpler rule (`if key == source then col 3 else col 15; set col 8 to background`) works for Example 2 but not Example 1.\n\nWhat is fundamentally different between Example 1 and Example 2 Inputs?\n*   Ex 1: Two background colors (9 and 0), separating the grid. Objects exist in specific rows (3, 8).\n*   Ex 2: One background color (7). Objects exist in col 1 and col 8 in many rows.\n\nMaybe the rule only applies if there's a single dominant background color?\nOr maybe the rule is different if the key or source is a background color?\n\nLet's re-examine the successful Ex 2 logic: `if key == source OR key == background: dest = 3 else: dest = 15`. `Output[r, dest] = source`, `Output[r, 8] = background`.\n\nWhat if the \"background\" used in the comparison (`key == background`) is different from the \"background\" used for replacement (`Output[r, 8] = background`)?\nIn Ex 2, bg=7.\n*   Row 1: k=1, s=8. 1!=8, 1!=7 -> dest=15. Output[1,15]=8, Output[1,8]=7. OK.\n*   Row 7: k=1, s=1. 1==1 -> dest=3. Output[7,3]=1, Output[7,8]=7. OK.\n*   What if Key == Background? Example: Input `[7 7 4 7 7 7 7 7 5 7 7 7 7 7 7 7]`. k=7, s=5. k==bg(7) -> dest=3. Output[?,3]=5, Output[?,8]=7.\n\nNow apply this logic carefully to Example 1.\nBackground color for replacement might depend on the row (9 for top, 0 for bottom).\nBackground color for comparison? Let's try 9 (overall most frequent).\n*   Row 0: k=9, s=9. k==s OR k==bg(9)? Yes (both). dest=3. Output[0,3]=9, Output[0,8]=9 (bg for row 0). Result: Unchanged. Incorrect.\n*   Row 3: k=5, s=9. k==s OR k==bg(9)? No. dest=15. Output[3,15]=9, Output[3,8]=9 (bg for row 3). Result: `[9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 3 9 2 9 5 9 9]`. Incorrect.\n*   Row 6: k=9, s=9. k==s OR k==bg(9)? Yes. dest=3. Output[6,3]=9, Output[6,8]=9. Result: Unchanged. Incorrect.\n*   Row 8: k=5, s=9. k==s OR k==bg(9)? No. dest=15. Output[8,15]=9, Output[8,8]=0 (bg for row 8). Result: `[0 5 9 5 9 3 9 5 0 3 9 5 9 2 9 9]`. Incorrect.\n\nThe results indicate the previous code's logic, although successful on Example 2, is fundamentally flawed for Example 1. The transformation in Example 1 seems unrelated to the simple column operations seen in Example 2. The appearance of pixels in rows 0 and 6 that seem to come from rows 8 and 3 respectively, and the single pixel change in row 3, suggest a different mechanism.\n\nGiven the discrepancy, it's best to discard the previous logic entirely and formulate a new one based on *both* examples. However, the examples seem very different.\n\nLet's focus on the simplest description that fits **Example 2**:\n1. Identify the background color (most frequent color, 7).\n2. For each row `r`:\n3. Get key color `k = input[r, 1]` and source color `s = input[r, 8]`.\n4. If `k` equals `s` OR `k` equals the background color:\n5. Set `output[r, 3] = s`.\n6. Else (`k` differs from `s` AND `k` is not the background color):\n7. Set `output[r, 15] = s`.\n8. In both cases, set `output[r, 8]` to the background color.\n9. All other `output` pixels are copied from the `input`.\n\nNow, how could this relate to Example 1? Example 1 fails drastically.\nMaybe Example 1 is a degenerate case or follows a different rule set triggered by the presence of two backgrounds or the specific structure? This seems unlikely for ARC tasks which usually have a single unifying principle.\n\nCould the columns be dynamic?\nEx 1: Cols 1, 8, 3, 15.\nEx 2: Cols 1, 8, 3, 15.\nThe columns seem constant.\n\nCould the *meaning* of the columns change?\nCol 1: Key\nCol 8: Source\nCol 3: Target if (Key matches Source) or (Key matches Background)\nCol 15: Target if (Key differs from Source) AND (Key differs from Background)\n\nLet's re-evaluate the \"background\" concept.\nIn Ex 2, 7 is the overwhelming background.\nIn Ex 1, 9 is the most frequent, but 0 is also very common and acts as a structural separator. What if the \"background\" for comparison depends on the row?\nLet `bg = 9 if r <= 7 else 0`.\nApply logic: `if k == s OR k == bg: dest = 3 else: dest = 15`. `Output[r, dest] = s`, `Output[r, 8] = bg`.\n\n*   Row 0: r=0, bg=9. k=9, s=9. k==s OR k==bg. dest=3. Output[0,3]=9, Output[0,8]=9. Result: Unchanged. Incorrect.\n*   Row 3: r=3, bg=9. k=5, s=9. k!=s AND k!=bg. dest=15. Output[3,15]=9, Output[3,8]=9. Result: `...[8]=9...[15]=9`. Incorrect.\n*   Row 6: r=6, bg=9. k=9, s=9. k==s OR k==bg. dest=3. Output[6,3]=9, Output[6,8]=9. Result: Unchanged. Incorrect.\n*   Row 8: r=8, bg=0. k=5, s=9. k!=s AND k!=bg. dest=15. Output[8,15]=9, Output[8,8]=0. Result: `...[8]=0...[15]=9`. Incorrect.\n\nThis isn't working. The logic from Example 2 doesn't generalize. There must be a different interpretation.\n\nCould the task involve finding pairs of identical pixels? No obvious pairs jump out.\nCould it involve shapes? The inputs have scattered pixels, not clear shapes beyond the frames.\n\nLet's reconsider Example 1 Input vs Output.\nInput:\nRow 3: `9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 3 9 2 9 5 9 9`\nRow 8: `0 5 9 5 9 3 9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 0`\nOutput:\nRow 0: `9 9 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 9 9 2 9 5 9 9`\nRow 3: `9 5 9 9 9 5 9 2 9 3 9 2 9 5 9 9` (Input[3,3]=3 changed to 9)\nRow 6: `9 5 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 3 9 9 9 9 9 9`\nRow 8: `0 5 9 5 9 3 9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 0` (Unchanged)\n\nFocus on the changes:\n1.  Output[0, c] seems to get values from Input[8, c]?\n    *   Output[0,3]=3 <- Input[8,5]=3 or Input[8,9]=3?\n    *   Output[0,5]=5 <- Input[8,1]=5 or Input[8,3]=5 or Input[8,7]=5 or Input[8,11]=5?\n    *   Output[0,7]=2 <- Input[8,13]=2?\n    *   Output[0,11]=2 <- Input[8,13]=2?\n    *   Output[0,13]=5 <- Input[8,1]=5 or Input[8,3]=5 or Input[8,7]=5 or Input[8,11]=5?\n    Maybe it copies the *last* occurrence?\n    *   Last 3 in row 8 is at col 9. Output[0,3]=3.\n    *   Last 5 in row 8 is at col 11. Output[0,5]=5, Output[0,13]=5.\n    *   Last 2 in row 8 is at col 13. Output[0,7]=2, Output[0,11]=2.\n    This mapping is still unclear.\n\n2.  Output[6, c] seems to get values from Input[3, c]?\n    *   Output[6,1]=5 <- Input[3,1]=5 or Input[3,5]=5 or Input[3,13]=5?\n    *   Output[6,9]=3 <- Input[3,3]=3 or Input[3,9]=3?\n    Maybe it copies the *first* occurrence?\n    *   First 5 in row 3 is at col 1. Output[6,1]=5.\n    *   First 3 in row 3 is at col 3. Output[6,9]=3.\n    This mapping is also unclear.\n\n3.  Output[3, 3] (value 9) replaces Input[3, 3] (value 3). Why? Is it because Input[3, 1] (key=5) != Input[3, 8] (source=9)? And Input[3, 1] != background (9)? This condition led to destination 15 in the previous logic. Here, it leads to modifying Input[3,3].\n\nLet's assume the core idea relates to Key=Col 1 and Source=Col 8.\nMaybe the transformation is:\n\"For each row `r`, compare Key `k=Input[r,1]` and Source `s=Input[r,8]`. If they are different, perform Action A. If they are the same, perform Action B.\"\n\nExample 1:\n*   Row 0: k=9, s=9. Same. Action B -> Copy some pixels from row 8?\n*   Row 3: k=5, s=9. Different. Action A -> Change Input[3,3] to 9?\n*   Row 6: k=9, s=9. Same. Action B -> Copy some pixels from row 3?\n*   Row 8: k=5, s=9. Different. Action A -> No change?\n\nExample 2:\n*   Row 1: k=1, s=8. Different. Action A -> Output[1,15]=8, Output[1,8]=7.\n*   Row 3: k=1, s=2. Different. Action A -> Output[3,15]=2, Output[3,8]=7.\n*   Row 7: k=1, s=1. Same. Action B -> Output[7,3]=1, Output[7,8]=7.\n*   Row 9: k=8, s=8. Same. Action B -> Output[9,3]=8, Output[9,8]=7.\n\nSo, Action A (Different Key/Source):\n*   Ex 1, Row 3: Change Input[3,3] to 9.\n*   Ex 1, Row 8: No change.\n*   Ex 2, Many rows: Set Output[r, 15] = s, Output[r, 8] = bg.\n\nAnd Action B (Same Key/Source):\n*   Ex 1, Row 0: Copy specific pixels from Row 8 to Row 0.\n*   Ex 1, Row 6: Copy specific pixels from Row 3 to Row 6.\n*   Ex 2, Many rows: Set Output[r, 3] = s, Output[r, 8] = bg.\n\nThis still looks like two different task rules. The actions are completely different. Is there any unifying factor?\n\nMaybe the \"background\" is the key difference.\nEx 1 has multiple backgrounds (9 and 0).\nEx 2 has one background (7).\n\nHypothesis: The rule depends on the number of background colors (defined as colors covering > X% of pixels, or colors forming frames?).\n*   If 1 background color (like Ex 2): Apply the Col 1/8 -> Col 3/15 logic.\n*   If >1 background color (like Ex 1): Apply the weird Row 0/8, Row 6/3 copy logic, plus the single pixel change in Row 3.\n\nThis seems too complex. Let's revisit the core logic of Ex 2 and see if it could apply to Ex 1 in a hidden way.\n`if k == s or k == bg: dest = 3 else: dest = 15`\n`output[r, dest] = s`\n`output[r, 8] = bg`\n\nWhat if the target columns (3 and 15) are not fixed?\nWhat if the columns involved (1, 8, 3, 15) are specific *to Example 2*?\n\nLet's look at Example 1 again without column assumptions.\nRow 3: `9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 3 9 2 9 5 9 9` -> `9 5 9 9 9 5 9 2 9 3 9 2 9 5 9 9`\nPixel (3,3) changes from 3 to 9.\nRow 8: `0 5 9 5 9 3 9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 0` -> Unchanged.\nRow 0 gets pixels 3, 5, 2. Row 6 gets pixels 5, 3.\n\nCould it be about matching patterns between rows?\nRow 3: `... 5 . 3 . 5 . 2 . 3 . 2 . 5 ...`\nRow 8: `... 5 . 5 . 3 . 5 . 3 . 5 . 2 ...`\nThere's some similarity.\n\nLet's reconsider the failed code's output for Example 1.\nInput: `[9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 3 9 2 9 5 9 9]` (Row 3)\nCode Output: `[9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 7 3 9 2 9 5 9 9]` (Row 3, based on k=5, s=9, bg=9 -> else -> dest=15 (val 9), src col 8 = 7. Wait, the transformed output shown earlier `[9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 7 3 9 2 9 5 9 9]` doesn't have 9 at index 15. This implies the `Transformed Output` shown in the prompt might also be incorrect or based on a different version of the code/logic).\n\nOkay, the prompt's description of the results seems inconsistent. The `Transformed Output` for Ex1 doesn't seem to fully match the `code_00.py` provided. Let's assume the `code_00.py` *is* the code used, and re-simulate its output for Ex 1, Row 3.\n*   Input Row 3: `[9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 9 3 9 2 9 5 9 9]`\n*   k=5, s=9, bg=9.\n*   k == s (F) or k == bg (F) -> False.\n*   Else branch: `destination_column = target_col_2_idx` (15).\n*   `output_np[r, destination_column] = source_color` -> `output[3, 15] = 9`.\n*   `output_np[r, source_col_idx] = replacement_color` -> `output[3, 8] = 7`.\n*   Resulting row should be: `[9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 7 3 9 2 9 5 9 9]` (assuming output starts as copy of input).\n*   The `Transformed Output` shown in the prompt for Row 3 is `[9 5 9 3 9 5 9 2 7 3 9 2 9 5 9 9]`. It matches my simulation!\n*   However, this `Transformed Output` is very different from the `Expected Output` `[9 5 9 9 9 5 9 2 9 3 9 2 9 5 9 9]`.\n\nLet's re-simulate for Ex 2, Row 1.\n*   Input Row 1: `[7 1 4 7 7 7 7 7 8 7 7 7 7 7 7 7]`\n*   k=1, s=8, bg=7.\n*   k == s (F) or k == bg (F) -> False.\n*   Else branch: `destination_column = target_col_2_idx` (15).\n*   `output[1, 15] = 8`.\n*   `output[1, 8] = 7`.\n*   Resulting row should be: `[7 1 4 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 8]`.\n*   The `Transformed Output` shown in the prompt matches this and matches the `Expected Output`.\n\nSo, the code `code_00.py` works for Example 2, but not Example 1. My initial analysis was correct. The logic derived from Example 1 (or perhaps just guessed) and implemented in `code_00.py` only happens to work for Example 2.\n\n**Final Approach:** Focus on describing the logic that works for Example 2, as that seems simpler and correctly implemented. Acknowledge that this logic does not work for Example 1, and the rule for Example 1 is unclear and seems significantly different, possibly involving inter-row dependencies or different columns/logic triggered by the grid structure or background colors. The natural language program should primarily describe the logic for Example 2, as that's the part we understand and got right.\n\n**Metrics:**\n*   Grid sizes: Both examples are 16x16 input -> 16x16 output.\n*   Example 1: Input colors {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}, Output colors {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}."
