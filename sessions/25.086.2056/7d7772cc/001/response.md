"""
Transform the input grid by conditionally moving pixels from a source column (column 8) to one of two target columns (column 3 or column 15) based on a comparison with a key column (column 1).

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Define the background color (7), key column index (1), source column index (8), first target column index (3), and second target column index (15).
3. Iterate through each row of the grid.
4. For each row, compare the pixel value in the key column with the pixel value in the source column.
5. If the key column pixel equals the source column pixel, OR if the key column pixel is the background color, move the source column pixel to the first target column (column 3) in the output grid.
6. Otherwise (if the key column pixel is not the background color AND it differs from the source column pixel), move the source column pixel to the second target column (column 15) in the output grid.
7. Replace the original pixel in the source column (column 8) of the output grid with the background color.
8. Return the modified output grid.
