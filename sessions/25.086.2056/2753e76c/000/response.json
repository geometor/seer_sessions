The outputs are smaller grids whose dimensions vary between examples (4x4, 3x3, 5x4).\n2.  **Objects:** The core elements seem to be these colored objects. Their shape, size, and exact position within the input grid don't seem directly preserved in the output.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to summarize information about the objects present in the input. Specifically, it focuses on *counting* how many distinct objects of each color exist.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output grid organizes this count information.\n    *   Each row corresponds to a unique color found in the input.\n    *   The colors are ordered across rows based on the *number of objects* of that color (most frequent first). If two colors have the same object count, the one with the lower numerical color value comes first.\n    *   Within each row, the number of cells filled with the row's color equals the count of objects of that color found in the input.\n    *   These colored cells are right-aligned within the row.\n    *   The number of rows in the output equals the number of distinct non-white colors in the input.\n    *   The number of columns in the output equals the maximum object count found for any single color in the input.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
