Data:
  Input: 2D grid of pixels (0-9)
  Output: 2D grid of pixels (0-9)
  Background: White (0)

Elements:
  Objects:
    - Definition: Contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color (1-9).
    - Properties:
      - Color: The specific non-white value (1-9).
      - Count: The total number of distinct objects of a given color in the input grid.

Derived Information:
  - Distinct Colors: Set of unique non-white colors present in the input objects.
  - Object Counts per Color: A mapping from each distinct color to its object count.
  - Max Object Count: The highest object count found among all colors.
  - Sorted Colors: List of distinct colors ordered primarily by object count (descending) and secondarily by color value (ascending) for tie-breaking.

Transformation:
  - Action: Identify and count distinct objects for each color.
  - Action: Sort colors based on count (descending) and value (ascending tie-breaker).
  - Action: Determine output grid dimensions:
      - Height: Number of distinct colors.
      - Width: Maximum object count.
  - Action: Construct the output grid row by row based on the sorted colors:
      - Each row `i` corresponds to the `i`-th color in the sorted list.
      - For a color `C` with count `N` assigned to row `i`, the last `N` cells of row `i` are set to `C`.
      - The first `Width - N` cells of row `i` are set to white (0).
