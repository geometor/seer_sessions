Identifies a primary shape (contiguous non-white, non-azure pixels) and a single azure marker pixel (8) in the input grid.
The azure pixel indicates how to extend the primary shape.
If the azure pixel is to the right of the shape's rightmost edge, the shape is extended horizontally to the right. The pattern for extension is taken from the column *at* the rightmost edge (index max_col) of the original shape. This pattern is copied into the columns from the original right edge + 1 up to and including the column of the azure pixel.
If the azure pixel is below the shape's bottom edge, the shape is extended vertically downwards. The pattern for extension is taken from the row *at* the bottom edge (index max_row) of the original shape. This pattern is copied into the rows from the original bottom edge + 1 up to and including the row of the azure pixel.
The azure marker pixel is removed (set to white 0) in the output grid.

The code execution results confirm the analysis:
*   The code is currently using the pattern from the absolute edge (`max_col` or `max_row`). See `pattern_from_actual_code`.
*   The expected output clearly uses the pattern from the row/column *just inside* the edge (`max_col - 1` or `max_row - 1`). See `pattern_from_expected_logic` and `pattern_in_expected_output`, which match each other.

The correction strategy is confirmed: modify the code to use index `max_col - 1` or `max_row - 1` for pattern selection.

Now, I will generate the requested deliverables.
## General Assessment

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a main shape and an azure (8) marker pixel. It determines if the marker is directly to the right or directly below the shape's bounding box. If so, it extends the shape in that direction up to the marker's row or column. The extension mechanism involves repeating a pattern taken from the shape's edge.

The code fails on all provided examples because it incorrectly identifies the pattern to be repeated. It copies the pattern from the *outermost* row or column of the shape (at index `max_row` or `max_col`), whereas the examples show that the pattern should be taken from the row or column *just inside* the edge (at index `max_row - 1` or `max_col - 1`).

The strategy to resolve this is to modify the pattern extraction logic in the code to use the row/column at index `max_row - 1` or `max_col - 1` instead of `max_row` or `max_col`.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Extends a primary shape based on the position of a single azure marker pixel. The marker indicates the target extent of the extension.

definitions:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
    properties:
      size: variable height and width (1-30).
      background_color: white (0).
  - object: shape
    type: Contiguous area of non-white (0) and non-azure (8) pixels.
    properties:
      bounding_box: [min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col] defining the minimum rectangle enclosing the shape.
      colors: Can contain multiple colors.
      structure: Often appears as a frame around a core, but can be solid.
  - object: marker
    type: A single azure (8) pixel.
    properties:
      position: (row, col).
      location_relative_to_shape: Can be outside the shape's bounding box. Specifically, in these examples, it's either directly to the right (same row range as shape, column > max_col) or directly below (same column range as shape, row > max_row).

transformation:
  action: extend_shape
  input: grid containing a shape and a marker.
  output: grid with the shape extended and the marker removed (set to white).
  conditions:
    - The marker pixel must exist.
    - A non-white, non-azure shape must exist.
    - The marker must be positioned directly to the right or directly below the shape's bounding box.
  steps:
    1. Create a copy of the input grid.
    2. Locate the marker pixel at `(marker_row, marker_col)`.
    3. Set the marker pixel's location in the output grid to white (0).
    4. Identify the bounding box `[min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col]` of the shape (pixels != 0 and != 8).
    5. Check extension direction:
       a. If `marker_col > max_col` (and marker is within shape's row bounds): Horizontal extension.
          - Identify the pattern: The column of pixels at index `max_col - 1` within the shape's row bounds (`grid[min_row : max_row + 1, max_col - 1]`).
          - Apply the pattern: Copy this pattern into all columns from `max_col + 1` up to and including `marker_col` in the output grid, within the shape's row bounds.
       b. If `marker_row > max_row` (and marker is within shape's column bounds): Vertical extension.
          - Identify the pattern: The row of pixels at index `max_row - 1` within the shape's column bounds (`grid[max_row - 1, min_col : max_col + 1]`).
          - Apply the pattern: Copy this pattern into all rows from `max_row + 1` up to and including `marker_row` in the output grid, within the shape's column bounds.
    6. If no marker or no shape is found, or marker is not in a valid extension position, return the grid with only the marker removed (if present).

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects**: Find the primary shape (contiguous non-white, non-azure pixels) and locate the single azure (8) marker pixel in the input grid. Determine the bounding box of the shape (`min_row`, `max_row`, `min_col`, `max_col`).
2.  **Initialize Output**: Create a copy of the input grid. Remove the azure marker from the output grid by setting its position to white (0).
3.  **Check Extension Condition**:
    *   If the marker's column (`marker_col`) is greater than the shape's rightmost column (`max_col`) and the marker's row is within the shape's vertical bounds (`min_row` to `max_row`), proceed with horizontal extension.
    *   Else if the marker's row (`marker_row`) is greater than the shape's bottom row (`max_row`) and the marker's column is within the shape's horizontal bounds (`min_col` to `max_col`), proceed with vertical extension.
    *   Otherwise, no extension is performed.
4.  **Perform Extension**:
    *   **Horizontal Extension**:
        *   Define the *pattern* as the column of pixels just *inside* the shape's right edge (i.e., column at index `max_col - 1`), spanning from `min_row` to `max_row`.
        *   Copy this *pattern* into the output grid for every column starting from `max_col + 1` up to and including `marker_col`, within the rows `min_row` to `max_row`.
    *   **Vertical Extension**:
        *   Define the *pattern* as the row of pixels just *inside* the shape's bottom edge (i.e., row at index `max_row - 1`), spanning from `min_col` to `max_col`.
        *   Copy this *pattern* into the output grid for every row starting from `max_row + 1` up to and including `marker_row`, within the columns `min_col` to `max_col`.
5.  **Return Output**: Return the modified grid. If no valid extension was performed, return the grid with only the marker removed.
