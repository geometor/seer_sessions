The pattern for extension is taken from the column *just inside* the rightmost edge (index max_col - 1) of the original shape. This pattern is copied into the columns from the original right edge + 1 up to and including the column of the azure pixel.\nIf the azure pixel is below the shape's bottom edge, the shape is extended vertically downwards. The pattern for extension is taken from the row *just inside* the bottom edge (index max_row - 1) of the original shape. This pattern is copied into the rows from the original bottom edge + 1 up to and including the row of the azure pixel.\nThe azure marker pixel is removed (set to white 0) in the output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_marker(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the coordinates (row, col) of the first azure (8) pixel.\"\"\"\n    marker_coords = np.where(grid == 8)\n    if len(marker_coords[0]) > 0:\n        # Return the coordinates of the first marker found\n        return int(marker_coords[0][0]), int(marker_coords[1][0])\n    return None # No marker found\n\ndef find_shape_bounds(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the bounding box [min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col] of non-white (0) and non-azure (8) pixels.\"\"\"\n    shape_coords = np.where((grid != 0) & (grid != 8))\n    if len(shape_coords[0]) > 0:\n        min_row = int(np.min(shape_coords[0]))\n        max_row = int(np.max(shape_coords[0]))\n        min_col = int(np.min(shape_coords[1]))\n        max_col = int(np.max(shape_coords[1]))\n        return min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col\n    return None # No shape found\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Extends a shape based on the position of an azure marker pixel, using the\n    pattern from the row/column just inside the relevant edge.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    # 1.
