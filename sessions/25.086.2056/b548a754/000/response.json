            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grids:** Each input grid contains a background of white pixels (0). There is a primary \"shape\" composed of non-white pixels. This shape can be a simple rectangle or a rectangle containing an inner pattern/color. Crucially, each input grid also contains a single, isolated azure pixel (8) located somewhere outside the primary shape.\n2.  **Output Grids:** The output grids show a modified version of the primary shape from the input. The shape has been extended either horizontally to the right or vertically downwards. The azure pixel is no longer present in the output grid; it seems to act as an instruction rather than part of the final image.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves stretching or extending the primary shape. The direction and extent of this extension appear to be dictated by the position of the azure pixel relative to the original shape.\n    *   If the azure pixel is located to the right of the shape's rightmost boundary, the shape extends horizontally to the right.\n    *   If the azure pixel is located below the shape's bottommost boundary, the shape extends vertically downwards.\n    *   The extension fills the space between the original boundary of the shape and the coordinate (column or row) indicated by the azure pixel.\n    *   The pixels used for the extension are copies of the pixels found on the edge of the shape that is being extended. For a rightward extension, the rightmost column of the shape is duplicated. For a downward extension, the bottommost row of the shape is duplicated.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
