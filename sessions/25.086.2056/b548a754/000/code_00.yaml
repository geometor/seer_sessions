task_description: Extend a shape based on the position of a marker pixel.

elements:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The base color of the grid.
  - role: shape
    color: any non-white, non-azure color (e.g., green, red, blue, magenta)
    description: A contiguous object or pattern, often rectangular, that is the main subject of the transformation. Can contain internal patterns.
    properties:
      - bounding_box: Defines the min/max row and column indices.
  - role: marker
    color: azure (8)
    description: A single, isolated pixel indicating the direction and extent of the transformation.
    properties:
      - position: Row and column index (r, c).
      - relative_position: Position relative to the shape's bounding box (e.g., right of, below).

actions:
  - name: identify_shape_bounds
    input: input_grid
    output: min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col for non-white, non-azure pixels.
  - name: identify_marker_position
    input: input_grid
    output: marker_row, marker_col for the azure pixel.
  - name: determine_extension_direction
    input: shape_bounds, marker_position
    output: direction ('right' or 'down')
    logic: If marker_col > max_col, direction is 'right'. If marker_row > max_row, direction is 'down'. (Based on examples, assuming only these two directions).
  - name: determine_extension_boundary
    input: marker_position, direction
    output: boundary_index (target column or row)
    logic: If direction is 'right', boundary_index is marker_col. If direction is 'down', boundary_index is marker_row.
  - name: extract_edge_pattern
    input: input_grid, shape_bounds, direction
    output: edge_pixel_pattern (a row or column of pixels)
    logic: If direction is 'right', extract the column at max_col within shape's row bounds. If direction is 'down', extract the row at max_row within shape's column bounds.
  - name: apply_extension
    input: input_grid, shape_bounds, direction, boundary_index, edge_pattern
    output: output_grid
    logic: Create a copy of the input grid. If direction is 'right', copy the edge_pattern (column) into columns from max_col + 1 to boundary_index, within the shape's original row bounds. If direction is 'down', copy the edge_pattern (row) into rows from max_row + 1 to boundary_index, within the shape's original column bounds. Set the original marker pixel position to white (0).

relationships:
  - The marker's position relative to the shape determines the extension direction.
  - The marker's column index determines the new right boundary for rightward extension.
  - The marker's row index determines the new bottom boundary for downward extension.
  - The pixels on the edge of the original shape are used as the pattern for the extension.

output_grid_properties:
  - Contains the extended shape.
  - Does not contain the azure marker pixel.
  - Background remains white.
