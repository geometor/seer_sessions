## General Assessment

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a shape and an azure marker (color 8). It correctly identifies the marker's role in indicating an extension direction (right or down). However, the code failed because it incorrectly identified the pattern to be repeated and the extent of the repetition.

The code assumed the pattern was the *outermost* row or column of the shape and repeated it in the space *between* the shape and the marker's coordinate (exclusive of the marker's coordinate).

Analysis of the failed examples reveals:
1.  The pattern used for extension is the row/column *immediately adjacent and interior* to the outermost edge facing the marker (i.e., the second-to-last row/column on that side).
2.  The extension fills the space from the edge of the shape *up to and including* the row/column index of the marker.

The strategy must be updated to:
1.  Extract the pattern from the row `max_row - 1` (for vertical extension) or column `max_col - 1` (for horizontal extension).
2.  Adjust the loop range for filling to include the marker's row/column index.

## Metrics and Evidence

Let's analyze Example 1 in detail using code execution for precision.

    if marker_col > max_col:
        extension_dir_1 = "horizontal"
        if max_col -1 >= min_col:

             pattern_1 = input_grid_1[min_row : max_row + 1, pattern_col_idx]
             fill_range_1 = range(max_col + 1, marker_col + 1)
        else:
             # edge case not hit here
             pattern_1 = "Edge Case?"
    elif marker_row > max_row:

```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Example 1:
  Input Shape: (11, 11)
  Marker Position: (np.int64(2), np.int64(10))
  Shape Bounds (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col): (np.int64(1), np.int64(4), np.int64(1), np.int64(5))
  Deduced Extension Direction: horizontal
  Pattern Column Index: 4
  Required Pattern: [3, 2, 2, 3]
  Columns to Fill: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

```
This confirms the analysis for Example 1:
-   Marker at (2, 10).
-   Shape bounds end at column 5.
-   Marker is to the right (`marker_col > max_col`).
-   The pattern should be taken from column `max_col - 1 = 4`, which is `[3, 2, 2, 3]`.
-   The columns to fill are `max_col + 1` to `marker_col` inclusive, which are columns 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

Similar analysis applies to Example 2 (vertical, use row `max_row - 1`, fill rows `max_row + 1` to `marker_row` inclusive) and Example 3 (horizontal, use column `max_col - 1`, fill columns `max_col + 1` to `marker_col` inclusive). The previous code failed by using `max_col`/`max_row` for the pattern and filling only up to `marker_col - 1`/`marker_row - 1`.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the single azure (8) pixel in the input grid; this is the `marker`. Store its `marker_row` and `marker_col`. If no marker exists, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the `output_grid`.
3.  Set the pixel at the `marker`'s position in the `output_grid` to white (0).
4.  Identify the primary shape by finding all non-white (0) and non-azure (8) pixels. Determine the bounding box of this shape: `min_row`, `max_row`, `min_col`, `max_col`. If no such shape exists, return the `output_grid` (with the marker removed).
5.  Check if the `marker` is positioned strictly to the right of the shape's bounding box (`marker_col > max_col`).
    *   If true, perform a horizontal extension:
        *   Define the `pattern` as the vertical slice of the *input grid* from the column `max_col - 1`, spanning rows `min_row` to `max_row` (inclusive).
        *   Iterate through columns `c` from `max_col + 1` up to and including `marker_col`.
        *   For each column `c` (if it's within the grid bounds), set the pixels in the `output_grid` at `output_grid[min_row : max_row + 1, c]` to the `pattern`.
6.  Else, check if the `marker` is positioned strictly below the shape's bounding box (`marker_row > max_row`).
    *   If true, perform a vertical extension:
        *   Define the `pattern` as the horizontal slice of the *input grid* from the row `max_row - 1`, spanning columns `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive).
        *   Iterate through rows `r` from `max_row + 1` up to and including `marker_row`.
        *   For each row `r` (if it's within the grid bounds), set the pixels in the `output_grid` at `output_grid[r, min_col : max_col + 1]` to the `pattern`.
7.  Return the modified `output_grid`.
