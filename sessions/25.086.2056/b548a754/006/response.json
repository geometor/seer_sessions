            "text": "The code execution results confirm the analysis:\n*   The code is currently using the pattern from the absolute edge (`max_col` or `max_row`). See `pattern_from_actual_code`.\n*   The expected output clearly uses the pattern from the row/column *just inside* the edge (`max_col - 1` or `max_row - 1`). See `pattern_from_expected_logic` and `pattern_in_expected_output`, which match each other.\n\nThe correction strategy is confirmed: modify the code to use index `max_col - 1` or `max_row - 1` for pattern selection.\n\nNow, I will generate the requested deliverables.\n## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a main shape and an azure (8) marker pixel. It determines if the marker is directly to the right or directly below the shape's bounding box. If so, it extends the shape in that direction up to the marker's row or column. The extension mechanism involves repeating a pattern taken from the shape's edge.\n\nThe code fails on all provided examples because it incorrectly identifies the pattern to be repeated. It copies the pattern from the *outermost* row or column of the shape (at index `max_row` or `max_col`), whereas the examples show that the pattern should be taken from the row or column *just inside* the edge (at index `max_row - 1` or `max_col - 1`).\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to modify the pattern extraction logic in the code to use the row/column at index `max_row - 1` or `max_col - 1` instead of `max_row` or `max_col`.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Marker Position | Shape Bounds (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) | Extension Direction | Pattern Source Index (Actual Code) | Pattern Source Index (Expected) | Pattern Used (Actual Code) | Pattern Used (Expected) | Match | Pixels Off |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------- | :---------------------- | :---- | :--------- |\n| 1       | (11, 11)    | (11, 11)     | (2, 10)         | (1, 4, 1, 5)                                        | Horizontal            | 5                                  | 4                               | `[3, 3, 3, 3]`             | `[3, 2, 2, 3]`          | False | 10         |\n| 2       | (11, 11)    | (11, 11)     | (8, 3)          | (1, 4, 1, 4)                                        | Vertical              | 4                                  | 3                               | `[2, 2, 2, 2]`             | `[2, 1, 1, 2]`          | False | 8          |\n| 3       | (13, 12)    | (13, 12)     | (5, 10)         | (1, 5, 2, 4)                                        | Horizontal            | 4                                  | 3                               | `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`          | `[1, 6, 6, 6, 1]`       | False | 18         |\n\n*(Metrics confirmed via code execution)*\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
