task_type: object_transformation
input_features:
  - shape: grid
  - elements: pixels with colors
  - structure: concentric rectangular layers of uniform color
  - properties:
      layers:
        - definition: Set of pixels equidistant from the nearest grid border.
        - distance: Calculated as min(row, col, height-1-row, width-1-col) for a pixel at (row, col).
        - layer_index: The distance value, starting from 0 for the outermost layer.
        - color: Each layer in the input has a unique color.
output_features:
  - shape: same as input grid
  - elements: pixels with colors
  - structure: concentric rectangular layers of uniform color
  - properties:
      layers:
        - definition: Same as input.
        - color: Derived from input layer colors based on a specific mapping.
transformation:
  - name: layer_color_inversion
  - description: The colors of the concentric layers are inverted based on their position.
  - steps:
      - Identify concentric layers and their colors in the input grid. Let layers be indexed 0 (outermost) to N (innermost).
      - Determine the color mapping: The color for output layer `i` is the color of input layer `N-i`.
      - Construct the output grid by applying this color mapping to each layer.
relationship:
  - The structure (number and shape of layers) remains the same between input and output.
  - The set of colors used remains the same.
  - The position of colors relative to the layers is inverted.
