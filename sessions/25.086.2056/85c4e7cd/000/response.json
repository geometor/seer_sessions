Each layer consists of pixels of the same color.\n3.  **Color Arrangement (Input):** Starting from the outermost layer and moving inwards, each subsequent layer has a distinct color.\n4.  **Color Arrangement (Output):** The output grids also have concentric layers, using the same set of colors as the input, but the order of colors is changed.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a reordering or swapping of the colors based on their layer position. Specifically, the color of the outermost layer in the input becomes the color of the innermost layer in the output, the color of the second outermost layer in the input becomes the color of the second innermost layer in the output, and so on. It's an inversion of the layer colors based on their distance from the border/center.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

A layer `i` consists of all pixels whose minimum distance to any of the four grid borders (top, bottom, left, right) is exactly `i`. The outermost layer is layer 0, the next is layer 1, and so on, up to the innermost layer, let's call it layer `N`.\n2.  **Extract Layer Colors:** Record the color associated with each layer `i` (from 0 to `N`) in the input grid. Store these as a list or map, e.g., `input_colors = [color_layer_0, color_layer_1, ..., color_layer_N]`.\n3.  **Determine Output Colors:** Create the color mapping for the output grid. The color for the output layer `i` will be the color of the input layer `N-i`. In other words, reverse the order of the extracted layer colors: `output_colors = [color_layer_N, color_layer_N-1, ..., color_layer_0]`.\n4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid. For each pixel in the new grid, determine its layer index `i` (its minimum distance to the border). Assign this pixel the color found at index `i` in the `output_colors` list (which corresponds to the color of input layer `N-i`).\n5.  **Return Result:** The newly constructed grid is the output."
