Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception of the Elements

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output grids are square or rectangular grids filled with colors.
2.  **Patterns:** The grids exhibit a pattern of concentric rectangular layers or frames. Each layer consists of pixels of the same color.
3.  **Color Arrangement (Input):** Starting from the outermost layer and moving inwards, each subsequent layer has a distinct color.
4.  **Color Arrangement (Output):** The output grids also have concentric layers, using the same set of colors as the input, but the order of colors is changed.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a reordering or swapping of the colors based on their layer position. Specifically, the color of the outermost layer in the input becomes the color of the innermost layer in the output, the color of the second outermost layer in the input becomes the color of the second innermost layer in the output, and so on. It's an inversion of the layer colors based on their distance from the border/center.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
input_features:
  - shape: grid
  - elements: pixels with colors
  - structure: concentric rectangular layers of uniform color
  - properties:
      layers:
        - definition: Set of pixels equidistant from the nearest grid border.
        - distance: Calculated as min(row, col, height-1-row, width-1-col) for a pixel at (row, col).
        - layer_index: The distance value, starting from 0 for the outermost layer.
        - color: Each layer in the input has a unique color.
output_features:
  - shape: same as input grid
  - elements: pixels with colors
  - structure: concentric rectangular layers of uniform color
  - properties:
      layers:
        - definition: Same as input.
        - color: Derived from input layer colors based on a specific mapping.
transformation:
  - name: layer_color_inversion
  - description: The colors of the concentric layers are inverted based on their position.
  - steps:
      - Identify concentric layers and their colors in the input grid. Let layers be indexed 0 (outermost) to N (innermost).
      - Determine the color mapping: The color for output layer `i` is the color of input layer `N-i`.
      - Construct the output grid by applying this color mapping to each layer.
relationship:
  - The structure (number and shape of layers) remains the same between input and output.
  - The set of colors used remains the same.
  - The position of colors relative to the layers is inverted.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Layers:** For the input grid, determine the concentric rectangular layers. A layer `i` consists of all pixels whose minimum distance to any of the four grid borders (top, bottom, left, right) is exactly `i`. The outermost layer is layer 0, the next is layer 1, and so on, up to the innermost layer, let's call it layer `N`.
2.  **Extract Layer Colors:** Record the color associated with each layer `i` (from 0 to `N`) in the input grid. Store these as a list or map, e.g., `input_colors = [color_layer_0, color_layer_1, ..., color_layer_N]`.
3.  **Determine Output Colors:** Create the color mapping for the output grid. The color for the output layer `i` will be the color of the input layer `N-i`. In other words, reverse the order of the extracted layer colors: `output_colors = [color_layer_N, color_layer_N-1, ..., color_layer_0]`.
4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid. For each pixel in the new grid, determine its layer index `i` (its minimum distance to the border). Assign this pixel the color found at index `i` in the `output_colors` list (which corresponds to the color of input layer `N-i`).
5.  **Return Result:** The newly constructed grid is the output.
