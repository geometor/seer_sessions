            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist primarily of a single background color (maroon `9`, azure `8`, or orange `7`) with a few sparsely placed single pixels of blue (`1`).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the same dimensions and background color as the input. The locations corresponding to the original blue (`1`) pixels in the input are transformed, and additional patterns are introduced, centered around these original locations.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation identifies each blue (`1`) pixel in the input and draws a specific pattern centered on its location in the output grid.\n4.  **Pattern Details:**\n    *   The original blue (`1`) pixel at `(r, c)` is replaced by a red (`2`) pixel in the output.\n    *   A horizontal line of blue (`1`) pixels is drawn across the entire row `r`, except at the center column `c` (which is red `2`).\n    *   A vertical line of blue (`1`) pixels is drawn down the entire column `c`, except at the center row `r` (which is red `2`).\n    *   Green (`3`) pixels are placed at the four diagonal neighbors of the center pixel `(r, c)`, i.e., at `(r-1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c+1)`, `(r+1, c-1)`, and `(r+1, c+1)`, provided these coordinates are within the grid bounds.\n5.  **Interaction/Overlapping:** When patterns from multiple input blue pixels overlap, the colors overwrite each other. The examples suggest a specific precedence: red (`2`) at the center seems final, green (`3`) seems to overwrite blue (`1`) at the diagonal locations, and blue (`1`) lines overwrite the background color. A two-stage process appears necessary: first draw the centers (`2`) and lines (`1`), then draw the diagonals (`3`).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
