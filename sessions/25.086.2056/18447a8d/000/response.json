            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task transformation.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids use orange (7) as a background color. Rows consisting entirely of orange pixels act as horizontal separators, dividing the grid into distinct \"bands\" or sections.\n2.  **Objects within Bands:** Each band contains two primary objects:\n    *   An azure (8) object positioned towards the left side of the band.\n    *   A second object of a different color (not orange or azure) positioned towards the right side of the band.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens within each band independently but follows a grid-wide rule.\n    *   The azure (8) object remains unchanged in position and color.\n    *   The right-side object is moved horizontally to the left so that its leftmost edge is immediately adjacent (1 pixel right) to the rightmost edge of the azure (8) object within that band.\n    *   The original position of the right-side object is overwritten with the background color (orange, 7).\n    *   Crucially, the *color* of the right-side object might change during the move. This color change follows a specific rule determined by the *set* of colors present in the right-side objects across the *entire input grid*.\n4.  **Color Change Rule:**\n    *   If the set of colors found in the right-side objects across all bands in the input contains exactly {blue(1), green(3), maroon(9)}, then a cyclic color mapping is applied: blue(1) becomes green(3), green(3) becomes maroon(9), and maroon(9) becomes blue(1).\n    *   If the set of colors found in the right-side objects across all bands in the input contains {green(3), yellow(4), magenta(6)} (potentially alongside other colors like red(2) which remain unchanged), then a different cyclic color mapping is applied: green(3) becomes magenta(6), magenta(6) becomes yellow(4), and yellow(4) becomes green(3). Colors not part of this cycle (e.g., red(2) in example 3) remain unchanged.\n    *   In all other cases observed (e.g., example 2 with colors {maroon(9), red(2)}), the colors of the right-side objects remain unchanged during the move (identity mapping).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Identify all row indices `r` where every cell in `input_grid[r]` is orange (7). These are separator rows.\n3.  Define bands as the row ranges between consecutive separator rows (or grid top/bottom edges and the nearest separator row).\n4.  Create a set `target_colors` containing the colors of all non-orange(7), non-azure(8) objects found on the right side within any band of the input grid.\n5.  Determine the color transformation function `transform_color(color)` based on `target_colors`:\n    *   If `target_colors` contains {1, 3, 9}: map 1 to 3, 3 to 9, 9 to 1. Other colors map to themselves.\n    *   If `target_colors` contains {3, 4, 6}: map 3 to 6, 6 to 4, 4 to 3. Other colors map to themselves.\n    *   Otherwise: map every color to itself.\n6.  For each identified band (defined by `row_start` and `row_end`):\n    a.  Find the maximum column index `anchor_right_edge` occupied by an azure (8) pixel within this band's rows (`row_start` to `row_end`).\n    b.  Identify the non-orange(7), non-azure(8) object within this band (the target object). Find its color `input_color` and its bounding box (`target_rmin`, `target_cmin`, `target_rmax`, `target_cmax`).\n    c.  Calculate the `output_color = transform_color(input_color)`.\n    d.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` within the target object's bounding box (from `r = target_rmin` to `target_rmax`, `c = target_cmin` to `target_cmax`).\n    e.  If the input grid cell `input_grid[r][c]` contains the `input_color`:\n        i.   Erase the original pixel in the output grid: set `output_grid[r][c] = 7`.\n        ii.  Calculate the relative column offset within the target object: `offset = c - target_cmin`.\n        iii. Calculate the new column position for this pixel: `new_c = anchor_right_edge + 1 + offset`.\n        iv.  Draw the transformed pixel in the output grid: set `output_grid[r][new_c] = output_color`.\n7.  Return the final `output_grid`."
