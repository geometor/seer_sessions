**Perception:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input is consistently a single row of 5 pixels (1x5 grid).
2.  **Output Structure:** The output is always a square grid (N x N).
3.  **Output Size Determination:** The size `N` of the output grid appears to be determined by multiplying the width of the input (which is 5) by the number of non-white pixels in the input row.
    *   Example 1: Input `0 9 0 8 4` (3 non-white pixels). Output size 3 * 5 = 15. Output is 15x15.
    *   Example 2: Input `0 0 2 0 0` (1 non-white pixel). Output size 1 * 5 = 5. Output is 5x5.
    *   Example 5: Input `1 0 7 0 0` (2 non-white pixels). Output size 2 * 5 = 10. Output is 10x10.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The input row is "stamped" or "drawn" diagonally across the output grid. The pattern starts with the input row placed at the bottom-left of the output grid. Subsequent rows upwards show the input row pattern shifted one position to the right relative to the row below it. This creates diagonal lines corresponding to each pixel in the input row, moving from bottom-left to top-right.
5.  **Color Handling:** The colors from the input row are directly copied to their corresponding positions in the output grid. The background of the output grid is white (0). Where diagonals overlap, the color from the input pixel with the higher index (further right in the input row) prevails.

      1. Get the width W of the input row.
      2. Count the number C of non-white (color > 0) pixels in the input row.
      3. The output grid size N is calculated as N = C * W.

      1. Initialize the N x N output grid with white (0) pixels.
      2. Let the input row be I.
      3. For each index k from 0 to W-1 (representing the position of a pixel I[k] in the input row):
         a. For each row index r from 0 to N-1 in the output grid:
            i. Calculate the column index c = (N - 1) + k - r.
            ii. If c is a valid column index (0 <= c < N):
               Set the output grid pixel at (r, c) to the color I[k].
    notes: This process implicitly handles overwrites, as later values of k will overwrite earlier ones if they map to the same (r, c) coordinate.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, which is a single row of pixels. Let its width be `W`.
2.  Count the number of pixels in the input row that are not white (color code 0). Let this count be `C`.
3.  Calculate the dimension `N` for the square output grid by multiplying the count `C` by the width `W` (i.e., `N = C * W`).
4.  Create a new square grid of size `N x N` and fill it entirely with the white color (0).
5.  Iterate through each pixel of the input row using its index `k` (from 0 to `W-1`). Let the color of the pixel at index `k` be `color_k`.
6.  For the current index `k` and its `color_k`, iterate through each row `r` of the output grid (from `r = 0` to `N-1`).
7.  Calculate the target column `c` using the formula: `c = (N - 1) + k - r`.
8.  Check if the calculated column `c` falls within the bounds of the output grid (i.e., `0 <= c < N`).
9.  If `c` is within the bounds, update the pixel at coordinates (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to `color_k`.
10. After iterating through all input pixels `k` and all output rows `r`, the output grid construction is complete. Return the final `N x N` grid.
