Output size 3 * 5 = 15. Output is 15x15.\n    *   Example 2: Input `0 0 2 0 0` (1 non-white pixel). Output size 1 * 5 = 5. Output is 5x5.\n    *   Example 5: Input `1 0 7 0 0` (2 non-white pixels). Output size 2 * 5 = 10. Output is 10x10.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The input row is \"stamped\" or \"drawn\" diagonally across the output grid. The pattern starts with the input row placed at the bottom-left of the output grid. Subsequent rows upwards show the input row pattern shifted one position to the right relative to the row below it. This creates diagonal lines corresponding to each pixel in the input row, moving from bottom-left to top-right.\n5.  **Color Handling:** The colors from the input row are directly copied to their corresponding positions in the output grid. The background of the output grid is white (0). Where diagonals overlap, the color from the input pixel with the higher index (further right in the input row) prevails.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Count the number of pixels in the input row that are not white (color code 0). Let this count be `C`.\n3.  Calculate the dimension `N` for the square output grid by multiplying the count `C` by the width `W` (i.e., `N = C * W`).\n4.  Create a new square grid of size `N x N` and fill it entirely with the white color (0).\n5.  Iterate through each pixel of the input row using its index `k` (from 0 to `W-1`). Let the color of the pixel at index `k` be `color_k`.\n6.  For the current index `k` and its `color_k`, iterate through each row `r` of the output grid (from `r = 0` to `N-1`).\n7.

If `c` is within the bounds, update the pixel at coordinates (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to `color_k`.\n10. After iterating through all input pixels `k` and all output rows `r`, the output grid construction is complete. Return the final `N x N` grid."
