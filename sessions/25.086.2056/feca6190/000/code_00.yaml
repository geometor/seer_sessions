input_description: A single row grid of width W (W=5 in examples).
output_description: A square grid of size N x N.
elements:
  - type: pixel

      color: Integer value 0-9 (0=white).

      1. Get the width W of the input row.
      2. Count the number C of non-white (color > 0) pixels in the input row.
      3. The output grid size N is calculated as N = C * W.

      1. Initialize the N x N output grid with white (0) pixels.
      2. Let the input row be I.
      3. For each index k from 0 to W-1 (representing the position of a pixel I[k] in the input row):
         a. For each row index r from 0 to N-1 in the output grid:
            i. Calculate the column index c = (N - 1) + k - r.
            ii. If c is a valid column index (0 <= c < N):
               Set the output grid pixel at (r, c) to the color I[k].
    notes: This process implicitly handles overwrites, as later values of k will overwrite earlier ones if they map to the same (r, c) coordinate.
