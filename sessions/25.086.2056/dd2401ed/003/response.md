Transforms the input grid based on the following rule:
1. Locate the vertical gray line column (`gray_col_in`). Treat the first column found containing any gray pixel as the line's column.
2. Count the number of blue pixels strictly to the left of `gray_col_in` (`blue_left_count`).
3. Count the number of red pixels strictly to the left of `gray_col_in` (`red_left_count`). (Note: This count is 0 in all provided examples).
4. Check if any blue pixels exist strictly to the right of `gray_col_in` (`has_blue_right`).
5. Count the total number of red pixels in the entire grid (`red_count`).
6. Determine a constant K based on the presence of blue pixels to the right and the total red pixel count:
    - If `has_blue_right` is true, set `K = 4`.
    - Otherwise (no blue pixels to the right):
        - If `red_count <= 5`, set `K = 2`.
        - If `red_count > 5`, set `K = 1`.
7. Calculate the horizontal shift distance for the gray line: `shift = blue_left_count + red_left_count + K`.
8. Calculate the destination column index for the gray line: `gray_col_out = gray_col_in + shift`.
9. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
10. Modify the output grid: In the column `gray_col_in`, change only the pixels that were originally gray (5) to white (0). Leave other pixels in that column unchanged.
11. Modify the output grid: In the column `gray_col_out`, change all pixels to gray (5
