"""
Identifies the largest contiguous non-background object (container) and a single pixel of a different color (source) within it.
Calculates the shortest distance from the source pixel to the boundary of the container object in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).
Determines the direction opposite to this shortest distance (projection direction).
Extends the source pixel's color along the projection direction, starting from the pixel adjacent to the source, until the boundary of the container object is reached.
The output grid reflects this color projection within the container, leaving everything else unchanged.

## General Assessment

The provided code failed on all training examples. The core logic attempted to:
1. Find the largest contiguous non-background object (container).
2. Find a single pixel of a different color (source) *within the coordinates* of the container.
3. Calculate distances from the source to the container boundary.
4. Project the source color in the direction opposite the shortest distance, filling only within the original container coordinates.

The failures indicate flaws in these assumptions:
*   **Source Identification:** The source pixel is not necessarily *within* the coordinate set of the largest object if defined strictly by color contiguity. It's often adjacent to it or nestled within a concavity.
*   **Distance Calculation:** Distances should likely be calculated from the source to the boundary defined by the *container's color*, not just the specific coordinates found.
*   **Projection Boundary:** The projection in the expected outputs extends to the *grid boundary*, not stopping at the edge of the initial container object.
*   **Projection Overwriting:** The projection overwrites whatever pixel color is present in its path (except the source itself), not just pixels that were originally part of the container.

The strategy is to refine the identification of the "source" pixel and the relevant "container" color/shape, recalculate distances based on encountering non-container colors or grid boundaries, and adjust the projection to extend to the grid edge.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's re-examine the properties of each example grid to confirm the revised logic.

Let's re-run analysis code carefully. Ah, I see the bug in my analysis code. `right`: `grid[source_r, c]` should be used. Let's fix the analysis code.

*(Self-correction: Corrected the distance calculation logic and re-verified the distances and resulting projection directions. The analysis code output was correct based on its logic, but my initial manual trace for example 1 (right distance) was wrong, and the analysis code itself had a bug copying `source_c` instead of `source_r` for left/right checks. The YAML reflects the corrected understanding confirmed by the fixed analysis code)*

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct contiguous objects of non-background (non-zero) color in the input grid. Record their color, coordinates, and size.
2.  **Identify Container:** Determine the largest object found in step 1. Let its color be `C_container`.
3.  **Identify Source:** Find a single-pixel object whose color (`C_source`) is different from `C_container` and which has at least one cardinal neighbor that is part of the container object (i.e., has color `C_container`). Assume there is exactly one such source pixel at position `(r_src, c_src)`.
4.  **Calculate Distances:** For each of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) from the source pixel `(r_src, c_src)`, count how many consecutive steps can be taken *before* encountering either the grid boundary or a pixel whose color is *not* `C_container`. This count represents the distance in that direction.
5.  **Determine Projection Direction:** Find the direction(s) with the *minimum* distance calculated in step 4. The projection direction is the *opposite* of the minimum distance direction. If there's a tie for minimum distance, use the corresponding opposite direction (e.g., if minimum is 'up', project 'down'; if minimum is 'left', project 'right'). (Note: The examples only show one minimum direction, implying ties might not occur or have a simple resolution if they do - potentially prioritizing vertical or horizontal, but for now, assume a single minimum).
6.  **Perform Projection:** Starting from the pixel adjacent to the source pixel `(r_src, c_src)` in the projection direction, change the color of pixels to `C_source`, continuing in the projection direction until the grid boundary is reached. Overwrite any existing colors encountered along this path.
7.  **Output:** The grid modified by the projection is the output grid. All pixels not affected by the projection retain their original color.
