Transformation Rule:
1. Identify all contiguous objects of non-background (non-zero) color.
2. Find the largest object ('container'). Record its color ('C_container').
3. Find a single-pixel object ('source') with a different color ('C_source') that is cardinally adjacent to the container object. Assume exactly one such source exists. Record its position ('r_src', 'c_src').
4. Calculate distances from the source pixel along the four cardinal directions. The distance in a direction is the count of consecutive pixels with color 'C_container' starting from the source's neighbor in that direction, stopping when a non-'C_container' pixel or the grid boundary is encountered.
5. Determine the direction(s) with the minimum distance.
6. The projection direction is the opposite of the minimum distance direction. (Assuming a single minimum direction based on examples).
7. Starting from the pixel adjacent to the source in the projection direction, paint pixels with 'C_source' along this direction until the grid boundary is reached, overwriting existing colors.
8. The modified grid is the output.
