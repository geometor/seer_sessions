Transformation Rule:
1. Identify all contiguous objects of non-background (non-zero) color.
2. Find the largest object ('container'). Record its color ('C_container') and coordinates.
3. Find a single-pixel object ('source') with a different color ('C_source') that is cardinally adjacent to the container object. Assume exactly one such source exists. Record its position ('P_source').
4. For each cardinal direction, calculate the 'distance' from the source P_source. The distance is the count of contiguous pixels having the container color C_container, starting from the neighbor of P_source in that direction and moving outwards, stopping when a pixel with a different color or the grid boundary is reached.
5. Find the direction(s) with the minimum calculated distance. If there are ties, select the first one in the order: up, down, left, right. This is the 'min_distance_direction'.
6. Determine the 'projection_direction' which is the cardinal direction opposite to the 'min_distance_direction'.
7. Find the 'projection_start_point': Starting from P_source, trace a path along the projection_direction through all contiguous pixels belonging to the container. The first pixel encountered along this path *after exiting the container* is the projection_start_point.
8. Perform Projection: Starting from the projection_start_point, paint pixels with the source color C_source along the projection_direction until the grid boundary is reached, overwriting existing pixels.
9. The modified grid is the output. If no container or source is found matching the criteria, return the original grid unchanged.
