            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code failed on all training examples. The core logic correctly identified the 'container' (largest object) and 'source' (single pixel of different color adjacent to the container). It also correctly determined the projection direction as the opposite of the direction with the minimum 'reach' from the source within the container.\n\nHowever, the failure occurred during the projection step. The code painted *over* existing pixels (including parts of the container) starting from the pixel adjacent to the source inside the container, extending to the grid boundary.\n\nThe analysis of the expected outputs reveals a different projection behavior:\n1.  The projection should *not* overwrite the container object or the source pixel.\n2.  The projection should start from the first *non-container* (background) pixel found along the projection path originating from the source, just outside the container's edge in that direction.\n3.  The projection should continue from this starting point towards the grid boundary, painting only the background pixels with the source color.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the projection logic to find this correct starting point and ensure only background pixels are painted along the projection line.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's analyze each example based on the refined understanding using code execution.\n\n"

Record its color (`C_container`) and coordinates.\n    *   Find a single-pixel object whose color (`C_source`) is different from `C_container` and which is cardinally adjacent to any pixel of the container. Assume exactly one such 'source' exists. Record its position (`P_source`).\n2.  **Calculate Distances**:\n    *   For each cardinal direction (up, down, left, right), calculate the 'distance' from the source `P_source`. The distance is the count of contiguous pixels *having the container color `C_container`*, starting from the neighbor of `P_source` in that direction and moving outwards, stopping when a pixel with a different color or the grid boundary is reached.\n3.  **Determine Projection Direction**:\n    *   Find the direction(s) with the minimum calculated distance. If there are ties, select the first one in the order: up, down, left, right. This is the `min_distance_direction`.\n    *   Determine the `projection_direction` which is the cardinal direction opposite to the `min_distance_direction` (up <-> down, left <-> right).\n4.  **Find Projection Start Point**:\n    *   Starting from `P_source`, trace a path along the `projection_direction`.\n    *   Follow this path through all contiguous pixels belonging to the container.\n    *   The first pixel encountered along this path *after exiting the container* (i.e., the first non-`C_container` pixel that is adjacent to the container edge along this path) is the `projection_start_point`.

Overwrite only the existing pixels along this line (which should typically be background color based on the examples).\n6.  **Output**: The modified grid is the result.
