**General Assessment**

The previous code failed on all training examples. The core logic correctly identified the 'container' (largest object) and 'source' (single pixel of different color adjacent to the container). It also correctly determined the projection direction as the opposite of the direction with the minimum 'reach' from the source within the container.

However, the failure occurred during the projection step. The code painted *over* existing pixels (including parts of the container) starting from the pixel adjacent to the source inside the container, extending to the grid boundary.

The analysis of the expected outputs reveals a different projection behavior:
1.  The projection should *not* overwrite the container object or the source pixel.
2.  The projection should start from the first *non-container* (background) pixel found along the projection path originating from the source, just outside the container's edge in that direction.
3.  The projection should continue from this starting point towards the grid boundary, painting only the background pixels with the source color.

The strategy is to modify the projection logic to find this correct starting point and ensure only background pixels are painted along the projection line.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_description: >
  The task involves identifying two key objects in the input grid: a 'container'
  (the largest contiguous object of a single color) and a 'source' (a single pixel
  of a different color that is cardinally adjacent to the container). Based on the
  shortest path from the source to the 'outside' (non-container or grid boundary)
  through the container, a projection line is drawn outwards from the container
  in the opposite direction.

definitions:
  - &background_color 0
  - &container
    description: The largest contiguous object of a single non-background color.
    properties: [color, size, coordinates]
  - &source
    description: >
      A single pixel object with a color different from the container, which is
      cardinally adjacent to at least one pixel of the container. Assumed to be unique.
    properties: [color, position]
  - &distance
    description: >
      The number of contiguous container-colored pixels starting from a neighbor
      of the source pixel, moving away from the source along one of the four
      cardinal directions, stopping when a non-container pixel or grid boundary
      is encountered.
  - &min_distance_direction
    description: >
      The cardinal direction (up, down, left, right) associated with the smallest
      calculated distance. Ties are broken by order: up, down, left, right.
  - &projection_direction
    description: The cardinal direction opposite to the min_distance_direction.
  - &projection_start_point
    description: >
      The first non-container (background) pixel encountered when moving from the source
      pixel along the projection_direction, passing through the container pixels.
  - &projection_line
    description: >
      A line of pixels starting from the projection_start_point and extending to
      the grid boundary along the projection_direction.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects**:
    *   Find all contiguous objects of non-background (non-zero) colors.
    *   Identify the object with the largest number of pixels as the 'container'. Record its color (`C_container`) and coordinates.
    *   Find a single-pixel object whose color (`C_source`) is different from `C_container` and which is cardinally adjacent to any pixel of the container. Assume exactly one such 'source' exists. Record its position (`P_source`).
2.  **Calculate Distances**:
    *   For each cardinal direction (up, down, left, right), calculate the 'distance' from the source `P_source`. The distance is the count of contiguous pixels *having the container color `C_container`*, starting from the neighbor of `P_source` in that direction and moving outwards, stopping when a pixel with a different color or the grid boundary is reached.
3.  **Determine Projection Direction**:
    *   Find the direction(s) with the minimum calculated distance. If there are ties, select the first one in the order: up, down, left, right. This is the `min_distance_direction`.
    *   Determine the `projection_direction` which is the cardinal direction opposite to the `min_distance_direction` (up <-> down, left <-> right).
4.  **Find Projection Start Point**:
    *   Starting from `P_source`, trace a path along the `projection_direction`.
    *   Follow this path through all contiguous pixels belonging to the container.
    *   The first pixel encountered along this path *after exiting the container* (i.e., the first non-`C_container` pixel that is adjacent to the container edge along this path) is the `projection_start_point`. Ensure this point is within the grid boundaries.
5.  **Perform Projection**:
    *   Starting from the `projection_start_point`, paint pixels with the source color `C_source` along the `projection_direction` until the grid boundary is reached. Overwrite only the existing pixels along this line (which should typically be background color based on the examples).
6.  **Output**: The modified grid is the result. If no container or source is found matching the criteria, return the original grid unchanged.
