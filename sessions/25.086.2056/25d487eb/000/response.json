The rest of the grid is background (white).\n    *   The container objects have varied shapes (cloud/mountain-like, L-shape, irregular blob).\n    *   The source pixel's color is different in each example (green, blue, red).\n    *   The container object's color is also different (azure, red, green).\n    *   In the output grid, the source pixel's color is extended in a straight line (up, down, or right in the examples) from the source pixel's original position.\n    *   This line of color fills the pixels within the container object along that path, stopping at the boundary of the container object. The original container object and source pixel remain otherwise unchanged.\n    *   The direction of the line seems to be determined by the position of the source pixel relative to the container's boundaries. Specifically, the line extends in the direction *opposite* to the nearest boundary of the container object from the source pixel.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
