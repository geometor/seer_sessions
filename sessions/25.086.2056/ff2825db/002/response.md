**General Assessment**

The provided code failed on all training examples. The core issue appears to be in the flood fill implementation. The current code fills almost the entire inner 8x8 area with the determined `Output Fill Color`, whereas the expected outputs show that the fill should be constrained, leaving some areas white (0).

The outputs generated have the correct frame color and correctly identify the `Output Fill Color`, but the application of this color within the inner area is overly aggressive. The hypothesis is that the flood fill should only spread into cells that were originally white (0) in the *input* grid, in addition to being white (0) in the *output* grid before filling.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the determination of `Input Frame Color` and `Output Fill Color` using code execution.
2.  Refine the flood fill logic to incorporate the constraint based on the input grid's white cells.
3.  Update the natural language program to reflect this corrected flood fill behavior.

**Facts**


```yaml
grid_dimensions:
  - input_shape: [10, 10] # Constant across examples
  - output_shape: [10, 10] # Constant across examples

structure:
  - common:
      - top_row: Copied directly from input to output (row 0).
      - frame: Defined by row 1, row 9, column 0, and column 9.
      - inner_area: Defined by rows 2-8 and columns 1-8 (size 7x8).

color_assignment:
  - frame_color:
      - input: Determined by the color in the input grid's second row (row 1). Assumed uniform. (Example 1: Yellow(4), Example 2: Red(2), Example 3: Blue(1)).
      - output: Determined by the most frequent color within the input grid's inner_area, excluding white(0) and the input frame_color. This color becomes the `Output Fill Color`. (Example 1: Gray(5), Example 2: Green(3), Example 3: Yellow(4)).
      - rule: The output grid's frame (row 1, row 9, col 0, col 9) is filled entirely with the `Output Fill Color`.
  - inner_area_fill:
      - seed_points: Locations within the input grid's inner_area that have the `Output Fill Color`.
      - initial_state: The output grid's inner_area starts as white(0), except for the frame boundary at row 2 (cols 1-8), which is part of the output frame and is filled with the `Output Fill Color`.
      - transformation:
          - Place the `Output Fill Color` at the `seed_points` locations within the output grid's inner_area.
          - Perform a flood fill (4-way adjacency) starting from these `seed_points`.
          - Constraint: The flood fill spreads the `Output Fill Color` only into adjacent cells within the inner_area that satisfy BOTH conditions:
              1. The cell is currently white(0) in the output grid.
              2. The corresponding cell in the input grid was also white(0).

derived_properties:
  - output_fill_color_determination:
      - area: Input grid inner_area (rows 2-8, cols 1-8).
      - excluded_colors: [White(0), Input Frame Color].
      - method: Find the color with the maximum count among the remaining colors.
  - inner_area_white_pixels:
      - expected_output: The number of white(0) pixels remaining in the inner_area matches the number of pixels incorrectly filled by the previous code (Pixels Off). (Example 1: 40, Example 2: 34, Example 3: 38).
      - transformed_output: The previous code resulted in 0 white pixels in the inner area.

error_analysis:
  - previous_code_issue: The flood fill implementation did not check the corresponding cell color in the input grid, causing it to fill all reachable white space within the inner area, instead of only the white space that was originally white in the input.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the `Input Frame Color` from the second row (index 1) of the input grid.
2.  Define the `Inner Area` as rows 2 through 8 (indices 2 to 8) and columns 1 through 8 (indices 1 to 8).
3.  Count the frequency of each color within the input grid's `Inner Area`, excluding white (color 0) and the `Input Frame Color`.
4.  Determine the `Output Fill Color` as the color with the highest frequency count from step 3.
5.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
6.  Copy the first row (index 0) from the input grid to the output grid.
7.  Fill the entire second row (index 1) of the output grid with the `Output Fill Color`.
8.  Fill the outer frame columns (index 0 and index 9) from row 2 downwards (indices 2 to 9) with the `Output Fill Color`.
9.  Fill the bottom frame row (index 9), between columns 1 and 8 (indices 1 to 8), with the `Output Fill Color`.
10. Fill the top inner frame row (index 2), between columns 1 and 8 (indices 1 to 8), with the `Output Fill Color`.
11. Initialize the rest of the `Inner Area` in the output grid (rows 3-8, columns 1-8) to white (color 0).
12. Identify all `Seed Points`: the coordinates (row, column) within the input grid's `Inner Area` where the color matches the `Output Fill Color`.
13. For each `Seed Point` (r, c), set the corresponding cell `output_grid[r, c]` to the `Output Fill Color`.
14. Perform a flood fill operation starting from all `Seed Points` simultaneously on the output grid:
    *   Use a queue and a set of visited coordinates, initialized with the `Seed Points`.
    *   While the queue is not empty, dequeue a coordinate (r, c).
    *   For each 4-way adjacent neighbor (nr, nc) of (r, c):
        *   Check if (nr, nc) is within the bounds of the `Inner Area` (rows 2-8, columns 1-8).
        *   Check if the neighbor has not been visited yet.
        *   Check if `output_grid[nr, nc]` is currently white (0).
        *   Check if the corresponding cell in the *input* grid, `input_grid[nr, nc]`, is also white (0).
        *   If all these conditions are true:
            *   Set `output_grid[nr, nc]` to the `Output Fill Color`.
            *   Mark (nr, nc) as visited.
            *   Enqueue (nr, nc).
15. Return the completed output grid.
