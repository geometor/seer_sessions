            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 10x10 grid.\n2.  **Static Top Row:** The first row (`1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5`) is identical in all inputs and remains unchanged in the corresponding outputs.\n3.  **Frame:** There's a concept of a \"frame\" surrounding an inner 8x8 area.\n    *   In the input, the frame's color is determined by the color filling the second row (row index 1). This color also occupies the boundary columns (0 and 9) and rows (2 and 9) from row/column index 2 onwards.\n    *   In the output, this frame structure persists, but its color changes.\n4.  **Inner Area:** The central 8x8 area (rows 2-8, columns 1-8) contains various colored pixels, including white (0).\n5.  **Color Transformation:**\n    *   The color of the frame in the output is different from the input frame color.\n    *   The second row in the output is filled with this new frame color.\n    *   The pattern within the inner 8x8 area changes significantly. It appears a specific color from the input's inner area is chosen, and then a shape is \"drawn\" or \"filled\" using this color within the output's inner area, replacing the original contents.\n6.  **Determining the Output Color:** The key seems to be identifying which color becomes the new frame color and the fill color for the inner shape. Let's analyze the relationship between the input inner area colors and the output fill color:\n    *   **Train 1:** Input frame=Yellow(4). Inner colors (non-white, non-frame): Grey(5), Blue(1). Output fill=Grey(5). Grey(5) is more frequent inside than Blue(1).\n    *   **Train 2:** Input frame=Red(2). Inner colors: Green(3), Yellow(4). Output fill=Green(3). Green(3) is more frequent inside than Yellow(4).\n    *   **Train 3:** Input frame=Blue(1). Inner colors: Red(2), Yellow(4). Output fill=Yellow(4). Yellow(4) is more frequent inside than Red(2).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The output frame/fill color is the *most frequent* color found within the input's inner 8x8 area, excluding white(0) and the input frame color itself.\n7.  **Generating the Inner Shape:** The shape in the output's inner area seems related to the locations of the chosen fill color in the *input's* inner area. It looks like a flood fill operation: start with the locations of the chosen fill color in the input's inner area, and fill outwards within the 8x8 boundary, replacing only the white background.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Examine the inner 8x8 area (rows 2-8, columns 1-8) of the input grid. Count the occurrences of each color, ignoring white (color 0) and the `Input Frame Color`.\n4.

Copy the first row (row index 0) from the input grid to the output grid.\n7.  Fill the second row (row index 1) of the output grid with the `Output Fill Color`.\n8.  Set the frame pixels in the output grid (rows 2-9 at columns 0 and 9; columns 1-8 at rows 2 and 9) to the `Output Fill Color`.\n9.  Initialize the inner 8x8 area (rows 2-8, columns 1-8) of the output grid entirely with white (color 0).\n10. Find all locations (coordinates) within the input grid's inner 8x8 area where the pixel color matches the `Output Fill Color`. These are the starting \"seed\" points for the fill.\n11. Perform a flood fill operation on the *output grid's* inner 8x8 area:\n    *   Start filling from the seed points identified in step 10, using the `Output Fill Color`.\n    *   The fill expands to adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells within the inner 8x8 area *only if* the adjacent cell is currently white (color 0).\n    *   Continue until no more white cells can be filled.\n12. The resulting grid is the final output."
