Grid_Dimensions:
  - Input: 10x10
  - Output: 10x10

Objects:
  - Frame:
      Description: A border structure surrounding an inner area.
      Input_Location: Rows 2-9 (Cols 0 & 9), Cols 1-8 (Rows 2 & 9).
      Input_Color_Source: Uniform color of the second row (index 1).
      Output_Location: Same as input.
      Output_Color_Source: Derived from inner area analysis.
  - Inner_Area:
      Description: The 8x8 central region enclosed by the frame.
      Location: Rows 2-8, Columns 1-8.
      Input_Content: Mixture of colors, including white(0).
      Output_Content: Primarily white(0) background with a filled shape.
  - Static_Row:
      Description: The top row (index 0) of the grid.
      Content: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5]
      Transformation: Remains unchanged from input to output.
  - Indicator_Row:
      Description: The second row (index 1) of the grid.
      Input_Content: Uniform color, defines Input_Frame color.
      Output_Content: Uniform color, matches Output_Frame color.

Properties:
  - Input_Frame_Color: The color of the Frame and Indicator_Row in the input.
  - Output_Fill_Color: The color used for the Frame, Indicator_Row, and inner shape in the output. Derived property.

Relationships:
  - Output_Fill_Color is determined by the most frequent color within the Input Inner_Area, excluding white(0) and the Input_Frame_Color.
  - The shape in the Output Inner_Area is formed by a flood fill originating from the locations where Output_Fill_Color appeared in the Input Inner_Area.

Actions:
  - Identify: Input_Frame_Color from Indicator_Row.
  - Analyze: Count non-white, non-Input_Frame_Color pixels in Input Inner_Area.
  - Determine: Output_Fill_Color based on highest frequency count.
  - Copy: Static_Row from input to output.
  - Set: Output Indicator_Row and Output Frame pixels to Output_Fill_Color.
  - Initialize: Output Inner_Area to white(0).
  - Flood_Fill: Within Output Inner_Area, starting from original locations of Output_Fill_Color in Input Inner_Area, fill adjacent white(0) pixels with Output_Fill_Color (4-way adjacency).
