Transformation Rule:

1.  Identify the color of the input grid's second row (index 1); this is the `Input Frame Color`.
2.  Analyze the inner 8x8 area (rows 2-8, columns 1-8) of the input grid. Count the occurrences of each color, excluding white (color 0) and the `Input Frame Color`.
3.  Determine the `Output Fill Color` as the color with the highest frequency count from the inner area analysis.
4.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input.
5.  Copy the first row (index 0) from the input to the output.
6.  Fill the second row (index 1) and the frame pixels (rows 2-9 at columns 0 & 9; columns 1-8 at rows 2 & 9) of the output grid with the `Output Fill Color`.
7.  Initialize the inner 8x8 area of the output grid with white (color 0).
8.  Identify all locations within the input grid's inner 8x8 area that contain the `Output Fill Color`. These are the seed points.
9.  Perform a flood fill operation within the output grid's inner 8x8 area, starting from the seed points. The fill uses the `Output Fill Color` and expands only into adjacent (4-way) white (color 0) cells.
