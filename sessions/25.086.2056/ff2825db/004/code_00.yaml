observations:
  - task_type: "frame_and_fill"
  - grid_dimensions: Consistent 10x10 in examples.
  - input_components:
      - top_row: A sequence of colors (indices 0,0 to 0,width-1). Seems decorative and is copied directly to the output.
      - input_frame: Defined by row 1 and potentially columns 0, width-1 and row height-1, though only row 1 is needed to determine its color.
      - content_area: A subgrid defined by rows 2 to height-2 and columns 1 to width-2. Contains various colored pixels and white (0) background pixels.
  - output_components:
      - top_row: Identical to the input top_row.
      - output_frame: Surrounds the content area. Consists of row 1, columns 0 and width-1 (from row 1 down), and row height-1. All pixels in the output frame are filled with the `Output Fill Color`.
      - content_area: Same dimensions as input content_area (rows 2 to height-2, columns 1 to width-2). Its content is derived from the input content_area.
  - color_determination:
      - input_frame_color: The color found in the input grid at row 1, column 0.
      - output_fill_color: The color that appears most frequently within the input content_area, excluding white (0) and the `input_frame_color`.
  - transformation_logic:
      - frame: The input frame is discarded. A new output frame is created using the `output_fill_color`.
      - content_area:
          - identify_seeds: Pixels within the input content_area that match the `output_fill_color` are identified as 'seeds'.
          - initialize_output_content: The output content_area is initially set to all white (0).
          - place_seeds: The identified seed pixels are copied from the input to their corresponding locations in the output content_area, overwriting the white background.
          - flood_fill: A fill operation starts from all seed pixels simultaneously. The `output_fill_color` spreads to adjacent (4-way) white pixels within the content_area boundaries, but only if the corresponding pixel in the *input* content_area was also white (0). Pixels in the input content_area that were neither white nor the `output_fill_color` are effectively ignored and remain white (0) in the output unless reached by the flood fill.
