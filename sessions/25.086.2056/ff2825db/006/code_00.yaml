task_context:
  description: The task modifies a grid that has a distinct top row and a frame structure below it. The goal is to redraw the frame and fill the inner content area based on the input grid's content.
  input_grid:
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - top_row: Row 0, seems decorative and is copied directly.
      - input_frame: A border structure starting from row 1 (e.g., row 1, col 0, col W-1, row H-1).
      - input_frame_color: The color filling the input_frame (specifically checked at [1, 0]).
      - content_area: The region inside the input_frame (rows 2 to H-2, cols 1 to W-2).
      - content_colors: Colors present within the content_area, excluding white (0) and the input_frame_color.
  output_grid:
    properties:
      - height: H (same as input)
      - width: W (same as input)
      - top_row: Identical to the input grid's top row.
      - output_frame: A border structure similar to the input, starting from row 1.
      - output_fill_color: The color used for the output_frame and the main fill color within the content area. Determined by the most frequent content_color from the input.
      - content_area: The region inside the output_frame (rows 2 to H-2, cols 1 to W-2). Filled based on a constrained expansion of the output_fill_color.
transformation:
  actions:
    - 1. Determine grid dimensions (H, W).
    - 2. Identify input_frame_color (from input[1, 0]).
    - 3. Define content_area boundaries (rows 2..H-2, cols 1..W-2).
    - 4. Count occurrences of content_colors within the input's content_area.
    - 5. Determine output_fill_color (most frequent color from step 4).
    - 6. Initialize output grid (H x W) with white (0).
    - 7. Copy input top row (row 0) to output top row.
    - 8. Construct output_frame using output_fill_color (row 1, col 0, col W-1, row H-1, respecting boundaries).
    - 9. Identify seed points: Coordinates (r, c) within the input content_area where input[r, c] == output_fill_color.
    - 10. Place seeds: Set output[r, c] = output_fill_color for all seed points.
    - 11. Perform constrained flood fill: Starting from seed points, fill adjacent white cells (0) in the output grid's content_area ONLY IF the corresponding input cell input[nr, nc] is either white (0) or the output_fill_color.
