Identify the `Input Frame Color` from the second row (index 1) of the input grid.\n2.  Define the `Inner Area` as rows 2 through 8 (indices 2 to 8) and columns 1 through 8 (indices 1 to 8).\n3.  Count the frequency of each color within the input grid's `Inner Area`, excluding white (color 0) and the `Input Frame Color`.\n4.  Determine the `Output Fill Color` as the color with the highest frequency count from step 3.\n5.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.\n6.  Copy the first row (index 0) from the input grid to the output grid.\n7.  Fill the entire second row (index 1) of the output grid with the `Output Fill Color`.\n8.  Fill the outer frame columns (index 0 and index 9) from row 2 downwards (indices 2 to 9) with the `Output Fill Color`.\n9.  Fill the bottom frame row (index 9), between columns 1 and 8 (indices 1 to 8), with the `Output Fill Color`.\n10. Fill the top inner frame row (index 2), between columns 1 and 8 (indices 1 to 8), with the `Output Fill Color`.\n11. Initialize the rest of the `Inner Area` in the output grid (rows 3-8, columns 1-8) to white (color 0).\n12. Identify all `Seed Points`: the coordinates (row, column) within the input grid's `Inner Area` where the color matches the `Output Fill Color`.\n13. For each `Seed Point` (r, c), set the corresponding cell `output_grid[r, c]` to the `Output Fill Color`.\n14. Perform a flood fill operation starting from all `Seed Points` simultaneously on the output grid:\n    *   Use a queue and a set of visited coordinates, initialized with the `Seed Points`.\n    *   While the queue is not empty, dequeue a coordinate (r, c).\n    *   For each 4-way adjacent neighbor (nr, nc) of (r, c):\n        *   Check if (nr, nc) is within the bounds of the `Inner Area` (rows 2-8, columns 1-8).\n        *   Check if the neighbor has not been visited yet.\n        *   Check if `output_grid[nr, nc]` is currently white (0).\n        *   Check if the corresponding cell in the *input* grid, `input_grid[nr, nc]`, is also white (0).\n        *   If all these conditions are true:\n            *   Set `output_grid[nr, nc]` to the `Output Fill Color`.\n            *   Mark (nr, nc) as visited.\n            *   Enqueue (nr, nc).\n15.
