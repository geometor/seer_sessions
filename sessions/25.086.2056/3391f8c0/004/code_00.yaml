task_description: Swap the shapes associated with two colors based on their locations.

definitions:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - object: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-background color.
  - shape: The pattern of relative pixel coordinates that define an object, relative to an anchor point.
  - anchor_point: A reference coordinate for an object, typically the top-left corner of its bounding box.

observations:
  - grid_properties:
      - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
      - All grids contain exactly two unique non-background colors (Color A, Color B).
      - Background pixels (white) remain unchanged unless overwritten by a drawn shape.
  - object_properties:
      - All objects composed of Color A within a single input grid have the same shape (Shape A).
      - All objects composed of Color B within a single input grid have the same shape (Shape B).
      - Shape A and Shape B may be different or the same.
      - Objects of the same color can appear multiple times at different locations.
  - transformation:
      - Identify the two non-background colors: Color A and Color B.
      - Determine the canonical shape for Color A (Shape A) and Color B (Shape B). This can be done by extracting the pattern from any one instance of an object of that color.
      - Find the anchor points for all instances of objects made of Color A (Locations A).
      - Find the anchor points for all instances of objects made of Color B (Locations B).
      - The output grid is generated by:
          - Placing Shape B, drawn using Color B, at each location in Locations A.
          - Placing Shape A, drawn using Color A, at each location in Locations B.
      - Placement is done relative to the anchor point (e.g., the top-left pixel of the shape aligns with the anchor point).

assumptions:
  - Contiguity for object definition likely includes diagonal adjacency based on visual inspection of shapes like '+'.
  - The anchor point is consistently the top-left corner of the object's bounding box.
  - All instances of a shape of a given color are identical within one input grid.
