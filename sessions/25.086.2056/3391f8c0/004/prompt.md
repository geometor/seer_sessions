```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the two unique non-white pixel values (colors) present in the input grid. Let these be color1 and color2.
2. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3. Find all coordinates (row, column) in the input grid where the pixel value is color1.
4. Find all coordinates (row, column) in the input grid where the pixel value is color2.
5. For each coordinate originally containing color1 in the input grid, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to color2.
6. For each coordinate originally containing color2 in the input grid, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to color1.
7. Return the completed output grid. White pixels remain unchanged because they are the initial state of the output grid and are not targeted by the color-swapping steps.
