            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code implemented a simple color swap: pixels of color A became color B, and pixels of color B became color A, *at their original coordinates*. The results clearly show this is incorrect. The transformation does not happen pixel-wise in place but involves the concept of \"objects\" or \"shapes\".\n\nThe core misunderstanding was treating the transformation as a simple color value replacement rather than an operation on geometric objects. The provided examples demonstrate that shapes associated with one color move to the locations previously occupied by the shapes of the other color.\n\nThe strategy to resolve the errors involves:\n1.  Identifying the distinct contiguous shapes (objects) formed by each of the two non-background colors in the input grid.\n2.  Determining the unique shape pattern associated with each color.\n3.  Identifying the anchor points (e.g., top-left corner of the bounding box) for each instance of these shapes in the input grid.\n4.  Constructing the output grid by drawing the shape associated with the *first* color (using its color) at the anchor points originally occupied by the *second* color's shapes, and vice-versa.\n\n## Metrics and Object Analysis\n\nBased on visual inspection and confirmed by code execution, here's an analysis focusing on objects:\n\n"

            "text": "**Analysis Summary:**\n\n*   **Consistency:** All examples contain exactly two non-background colors. Let's call them Color A and Color B.\n*   **Objects:** Each color forms one or more distinct, contiguous objects.\n*   **Unique Shapes:** Within a single example grid, all objects of Color A have the same shape pattern (relative pixel coordinates). Similarly, all objects of Color B have their own unique shape pattern.\n*   **Locations:** Each object can be located by an anchor point, such as the top-left corner of its bounding box.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves swapping the shapes associated with the colors. The *shape* of Color A is drawn (using Color A) at the original anchor points of Color B's objects. The *shape* of Color B is drawn (using Color B) at the original anchor points of Color A's objects.\n*   **Output Construction:** The output grid is initially empty (all background color). The shapes are then \"stamped\" onto this grid at the calculated positions. Overlapping pixels are overwritten (although no overlaps seem to occur in these examples).\n\n**Discrepancy with Previous Code:** The previous code swapped colors pixel by pixel (`output_np[coords_color1] = color2`). The correct approach requires identifying object shapes and locations, then redrawing the *other* color's shape at those locations. The code output above provides the necessary object locations (`top_left`) and shape patterns (`shape1_pattern_relative_coords`, `shape2_pattern_relative_coords`) to implement the correct logic. *Note: The object detection logic in the tool code needs refinement to correctly capture the full shapes as seen in the visual examples, rather than just the components found by default `scipy.ndimage.label`. Example 1 shows multiple small objects for color 3 instead of two '+' shapes. Example 3 shows single pixels for color 1 and 7 instead of 'L' and 'dot' shapes. This indicates the default connectivity might be wrong or the shape extraction logic needs adjusting. However, the *principle* of swapping shapes based on location remains the core observation.* Assuming we can correctly extract the canonical shape for each color and the top-left anchor points for each instance.\n\n## YAML Fact Block\n\n"
