Find all coordinates (row, column) in the input grid where the pixel value is color1.\n4. Find all coordinates (row, column) in the input grid where the pixel value is color2.\n5. For each coordinate originally containing color1 in the input grid, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to color2.\n6. For each coordinate originally containing color2 in the input grid, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to color1.\n7. Return the completed output grid.
