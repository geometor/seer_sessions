This object has the exact same shape and position as the gray object in the corresponding input grid.\n3.  **Color Transformation:** The color of the object in the output grid is different from gray. It appears to be derived from one of the scattered, non-gray, non-white pixels present in the input grid.\n4.  **Identifying the Rule:** The core task seems to be identifying which of the scattered pixels determines the color of the output object, and then replacing the gray object with that color, removing everything else.\n5.  **Hypothesis - Proximity:** The color chosen for the output object appears to be the color of the scattered pixel that is *closest* to the gray object.\n6.  **Distance Metric:** Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences in row and column coordinates) seems appropriate for grid-based tasks. The distance should be calculated from the scattered pixel to the *nearest* pixel of the gray object.\n7.  **Tie-breaking:** In cases where multiple scattered pixels of different colors are equidistant (minimum distance) from the gray object, the pixel with the higher numerical color value seems to be chosen (as seen in `train_2` where Maroon (9) was chosen over Red (2), both having a minimum Manhattan distance of 2).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
