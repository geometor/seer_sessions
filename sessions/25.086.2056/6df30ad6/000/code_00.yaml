- task_type: object_transformation
- description: Replace a specific object (gray) with a color determined by proximity analysis of other objects.
- objects:
    - type: background
      color: white (0)
      properties: occupies most of the grid.
    - type: target_object
      color: gray (5)
      properties: 
        - contiguous shape (can be horizontal bar, square, vertical bar, rectangle, or more complex).
        - unique instance in the grid.
    - type: color_source_pixels
      color: non-white (1-4, 6-9)
      properties:
        - appear as single, scattered pixels.
        - potentially multiple instances of various colors.
- relationships:
    - spatial_proximity: The key relationship is the Manhattan distance between each `color_source_pixel` and the `target_object`. The distance is the minimum Manhattan distance from the `color_source_pixel` to *any* pixel within the `target_object`.
- actions:
    - identify: Locate the `target_object` (gray pixels).
    - identify: Locate all `color_source_pixels`.
    - calculate_distance: For each `color_source_pixel`, find its minimum Manhattan distance to the `target_object`.
    - find_minimum: Determine the smallest distance calculated.
    - filter: Identify all `color_source_pixels` having this minimum distance.
    - select_color (tie-breaking): From the filtered pixels, choose the color with the highest numerical value. This is the `replacement_color`.
    - transform: Create a new grid of the same size, initially all white.
    - replace: Copy the shape and position of the input `target_object` onto the new grid, using the `replacement_color`.
- output: The transformed grid containing only the recolored object on a white background.
