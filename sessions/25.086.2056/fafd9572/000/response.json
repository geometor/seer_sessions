The non-blue, non-white background elements remain unchanged. The transformation preserves the shapes of the blue objects but alters their color according to a rule based on the order of the blue objects and the order of the available palette colors. The order for both blue objects and palette colors seems to be determined by a top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan of the grid. Specifically, the first blue object identified takes the color of the first palette color identified, the last blue object takes the color of the last palette color, and any blue objects in between take the color of the second palette color identified.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
