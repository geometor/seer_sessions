task_description: Recolor blue objects based on an ordered palette of other colors present in the grid.
background_color: 0 (white)
target_object_color: 1 (blue)
palette_colors: Any color C where C != 0 and C != 1.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous group of pixels of the same color (using 8-way adjacency, including diagonals).
  - blue_object: An object where the color is 1 (blue).
  - palette_color: A color present in the input grid that is neither white (0) nor blue (1).
  - object_order: Determined by the top-leftmost pixel of the object (scan top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).
  - palette_order: Determined by the first appearance of each unique palette color (scan top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).

input_features:
  - grid: The input 2D array.
  - blue_objects: A list of blue objects, ordered by object_order. Let N be the count.
  - palette: An ordered list of unique palette colors, ordered by palette_order. Let M be the count.

transformations:
  - identify_blue_objects: Find all blue_objects in the grid and order them.
  - identify_palette: Find all unique palette_colors and order them.
  - recolor_blue_objects: Change the color of the pixels belonging to each blue_object based on its position in the ordered list (B[0]...B[N-1]) and the ordered palette (P[0]...P[M-1]).

recoloring_rules:
  - rule_existence_check: If N=0 (no blue objects) or M=0 (no palette colors), the grid remains unchanged.
  - rule_first_object: The first blue object (B[0]) is always recolored with the first palette color (P[0]).
  - rule_subsequent_objects (applies only if N > 1):
    - rule_last_object:
        - condition_N_eq_M: If N == M, the last blue object (B[N-1]) is recolored with the last palette color (P[M-1]).
        - condition_N_neq_M: If N != M, the last blue object (B[N-1]) is recolored with the first palette color (P[0]).
    - rule_intermediate_objects (applies only if N > 2):
        - condition_M_eq_1: If M == 1, all intermediate blue objects (B[1] to B[N-2]) are recolored with the first (and only) palette color (P[0]).
        - condition_M_gt_1: If M > 1, all intermediate blue objects (B[1] to B[N-2]) are recolored with the second palette color (P[1]).

output_features:
  - grid: The transformed 2D array where blue objects have been recolored according to the rules, and all other pixels remain unchanged.
