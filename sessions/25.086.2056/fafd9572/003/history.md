Recolor blue (1) objects based on the order of appearance of other non-white, non-blue colors (palette colors).

1. Identify unique palette colors (not white 0, not blue 1) and their order of first appearance (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
2. Identify all contiguous blue (1) objects and their order based on their top-leftmost pixel (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
3. Recolor the blue objects using the palette colors:
   - The first blue object takes the first palette color.
   - If there are multiple blue objects and multiple palette colors:
     - The last blue object takes the last palette color.
     - Intermediate blue objects (if any) take the second palette color.
   - If there are multiple blue objects but only one palette color, all blue objects take that single palette color.
4. Non-blue objects and the white background remain unchanged.

## General Assessment

The previous code successfully implemented the logic derived from the first example, where the first blue object took the first palette color, the last blue object took the last palette color, and any intermediate blue objects took the second palette color. This worked for Example 1.

However, the results for Example 2 show this logic is incomplete. In Example 2, there are 7 blue objects and 2 palette colors. The expected output shows the first blue object taking the first palette color (Red), the *last* blue object also taking the *first* palette color (Red), and all intermediate blue objects taking the second palette color (Green). This contradicts the "last blue takes last palette" rule observed in Example 1.

The key difference seems to be the relationship between the number of blue objects (N) and the number of palette colors (M).
- In Example 1, N=3 and M=3 (N == M). The last blue object took the last palette color.
- In Example 2, N=7 and M=2 (N != M). The last blue object took the *first* palette color.

The strategy is to refine the natural language program and subsequent code to account for this conditional behavior, specifically regarding the coloring of the last blue object. The coloring rule for the first and intermediate objects appears consistent, provided M > 1 for the intermediate rule.

## Metrics

**Example 1:**
- Input Grid Size: 10x12
- Output Grid Size: 10x12
- Palette Colors (non-0, non-1): Red (2), Yellow (4), Green (3)
- Palette Order (by first appearance top-left): P = [Red, Yellow, Green] (M=3)
- Blue Objects (contiguous color 1): 3 objects found.
- Blue Object Order (by top-left coordinate): B = [B1 at (1,5), B2 at (1,8), B3 at (4,5)] (N=3)
- Condition: N == M
- Transformation Rule Applied (Observed):
    - B1 (first) -> P1 (Red)
    - B3 (last) -> P3 (Green - last palette color)
    - B2 (intermediate) -> P2 (Yellow - second palette color)
- Previous Code Result: Match

**Example 2:**
- Input Grid Size: 12x18
- Output Grid Size: 12x18
- Palette Colors (non-0, non-1): Red (2), Green (3)
- Palette Order (by first appearance top-left): P = [Red, Green] (M=2)
- Blue Objects (contiguous color 1): 7 objects found.

- **Correction**: My manual count/identification for Example 2 was slightly off. There are 6 blue objects, not 7. The object at (6,9) in my mental walkthrough doesn't exist. Let's re-evaluate Example 2 with N=6.
- Blue Object Order (by top-left coordinate): B = [B1 at (0,0), B2 at (0,4), B3 at (4,0), B4 at (4,8), B5 at (8,4), B6 at (8,8)] (N=6)

    - B1 (first) -> P1 (Red)

    - B2, B3, B4, B5 (intermediate) -> P2 (Green - second palette color)

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Recolor blue objects based on an ordered palette of other colors present in the grid.
background_color: 0 (white)
target_object_color: 1 (blue)
palette_colors: Any color C where C != 0 and C != 1.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous group of pixels of the same color (using 8-way adjacency, including diagonals).
  - blue_object: An object where the color is 1 (blue).
  - palette_color: A color present in the input grid that is neither white (0) nor blue (1).
  - object_order: Determined by the top-leftmost pixel of the object (scan top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).
  - palette_order: Determined by the first appearance of each unique palette color (scan top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).

input_features:
  - grid: The input 2D array.
  - blue_objects: A list of blue objects, ordered by object_order. Let N be the count.
  - palette: An ordered list of unique palette colors, ordered by palette_order. Let M be the count.

transformations:
  - identify_blue_objects: Find all blue_objects in the grid and order them.
  - identify_palette: Find all unique palette_colors and order them.
  - recolor_blue_objects: Change the color of the pixels belonging to each blue_object based on its position in the ordered list (B[0]...B[N-1]) and the ordered palette (P[0]...P[M-1]).

recoloring_rules:
  - rule_existence_check: If N=0 (no blue objects) or M=0 (no palette colors), the grid remains unchanged.
  - rule_first_object: The first blue object (B[0]) is always recolored with the first palette color (P[0]).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Palette Colors**: Scan the input grid row by row, from top to bottom, and within each row, from left to right. Record the unique colors encountered that are neither white (0) nor blue (1). Maintain the order in which these colors are first encountered. This ordered list is the `palette`. Let M be the number of colors in the `palette`.
2.  **Identify Blue Objects**: Find all distinct contiguous objects composed of blue (1) pixels, considering pixels connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally as part of the same object.
3.  **Order Blue Objects**: Determine the top-leftmost pixel for each blue object. Sort the blue objects based on these coordinates (first by row index, then by column index). This creates an ordered list of blue objects `B`. Let N be the number of blue objects.
4.  **Check Applicability**: If no blue objects are found (N=0) or no palette colors are found (M=0), return the input grid unchanged.
5.  **Initialize Output Grid**: Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
6.  **Recolor First Blue Object**: Recolor all pixels of the first blue object (`B[0]`) in the output grid using the first palette color (`palette[0]`).
7.  **Recolor Subsequent Blue Objects (if N > 1)**:
    a.  **Recolor Last Blue Object**:
        *   If the number of blue objects equals the number of palette colors (N == M), recolor the last blue object (`B[N-1]`) using the last palette color (`palette[M-1]`).
        *   Otherwise (if N != M), recolor the last blue object (`B[N-1]`) using the first palette color (`palette[0]`).
    b.  **Recolor Intermediate Blue Objects (if N > 2)**:
        *   If there is only one palette color (M == 1), recolor all intermediate blue objects (`B[1]` through `B[N-2]`) using the first (and only) palette color (`palette[0]`).
        *   If there is more than one palette color (M > 1), recolor all intermediate blue objects (`B[1]` through `B[N-2]`) using the second palette color (`palette[1]`).
8.  **Return Output**: Return the modified output grid.
