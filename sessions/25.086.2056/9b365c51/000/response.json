            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids generally consist of three main parts:\n    *   A white background (color 0).\n    *   Several distinct vertical lines, each one pixel wide and extending the full height of the grid. Each line has a unique color (not white/0 and not azure/8). These lines appear on the left side, separated by white columns.\n    *   One or more shapes made of azure pixels (color 8) located to the right of the vertical lines. These shapes can be complex and sometimes disconnected, but are treated based on the columns they occupy.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids have the same dimensions as the input grids.\n    *   The vertical color lines from the input are gone.\n    *   The areas originally occupied by azure pixels are now colored, using the colors from the vertical lines.\n    *   All other pixels, including the original positions of the vertical lines and the original white background, are white (color 0).\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The vertical lines act as color palettes or instructions. Their horizontal order is crucial.\n    *   The azure pixels act as targets for recoloring.\n    *   The columns containing azure pixels are grouped into contiguous blocks. For instance, if azure appears in columns 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, the groups are {7, 8, 9} and {11, 12}.\n    *   There's a one-to-one mapping between the ordered vertical color lines (left-to-right) and the ordered groups of azure columns (left-to-right).\n    *   The first color line dictates the new color for all azure pixels within the first group of azure columns. The second line dictates the color for the second group, and so on.\n    *   The position (row and column) of each azure pixel remains the same in the output grid, but its color changes according to the mapping rule.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all vertical \"color lines\" in the `input_grid`. A color line is a column `j` where every cell `input_grid[row][j]` contains the same color `C`, and `C` is not white (0) and not azure (8). Store these as pairs of `(color, column_index)`.\n3.  Sort these color line pairs based on their `column_index` in ascending order. Let the sorted colors be `C1, C2, ..., CN`.\n4.  Identify all unique column indices in the `input_grid` that contain at least one azure (8) pixel.\n5.  Group these azure column indices into contiguous sets. For example, if azure pixels are in columns 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, the groups are `{7, 8}` and `{10, 11, 12}`.\n6.  Sort these groups based on their minimum column index in ascending order. Let the sorted groups be `G1, G2, ..., GN`.\n7.  Iterate through each cell `(row, col)` of the `input_grid`.\n8.  If the cell `input_grid[row][col]` contains the azure color (8):\n    a.  Determine which group `Gi` the `col` belongs to (where `Gi` is one of the sorted groups `G1` to `GN`).\n    b.  Find the index `i` of that group (e.g., if `col` is in `G2`, then `i` is 2).\n    c.  Get the corresponding color `Ci` from the sorted list of color line colors (e.g., if `i` is 2, use color `C2`).\n    d.  Set the cell `output_grid[row][col]` to this color `Ci`.\n9.  Return the `output_grid`."
