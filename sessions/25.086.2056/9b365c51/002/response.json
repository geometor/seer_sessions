The code merged 8-11 and 12-13 because columns 12 and 13 contain azure pixels, making the indices contiguous. It also missed cols 19 in the last group. Let's check col 15. `input_grid_2[:, 15]` is `[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]`. Yes, it has azure. Col 19: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Col 19 has NO azure pixels. Why did the manual trace and expected output include col 19? Ah, the expected output for Ex 2 shows cols 16-19 colored red. But `input_grid_2[:, 19]` is all zeros. My analysis of the *expected output* was wrong there. Let's re-examine Example 2.\n        *   Input: Azure in cols 8,9,10,11 (group 1), 12,13 (group 2), 16,17,18 (group 3).\n        *   Output: Colors cols 8-11 yellow (4), cols 12-13 green (3), cols 16-18 red (2). This aligns with 3 lines mapping to 3 groups.\n        *   The code's `find_azure_column_groups` logic finds columns containing *any* azure pixel: {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18}. Sorted: [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18].\n        *   Group building: `[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]`. Then `16 != 13+1`. Add first group. Start `[16]`. `17=16+1` -> `[16, 17]`. `18=17+1` -> `[16, 17, 18]`. Add second group.\n        *   Result: `[[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [16, 17, 18]]`. **Still incorrect!** The code found 2 groups, but visually there are 3 distinct azure regions corresponding to the output colors. Why did the code merge cols 8-11 and 12-13? Because the *column indices* are contiguous (12=11+1) and *both sets of columns* contain azure pixels. The code doesn't check for separating columns *without* azure pixels.\n    *   Ex 3: Found 2 groups: `[[9, 10, 11, 12], [14, 15, 16, 17]]`. **INCORRECT!** Visually and based on output, there should be 4 groups corresponding to the 4 lines. Output colors cols 9-10 green(3), 11-12 red(2), 14-15 yellow(4), 16-17 orange(7).\n        *   Input Azure cols: {9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17}. Sorted: [9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17].\n        *   Group building: `[9, 10, 11, 12]`. Then `14 != 12+1`. Add first group. Start `[14]`. `15=14+1` -> `[14, 15]`. `16=15+1` -> `[14, 15, 16]`. `17=16+1` -> `[14, 15, 16, 17]`. Add second group.\n        *   Result: `[[9, 10, 11, 12], [14, 15, 16, 17]]`. Again, incorrect grouping.\n\n**Conclusions from Tool Output & Analysis:**\n\n1.  The `find_vertical_lines` function works correctly for these examples (assuming lines are full height).\n2.  The `find_azure_column_groups` function is fundamentally flawed. It merges groups if their column indices are contiguous, even if separated by columns *without* azure pixels. It should identify groups of contiguous columns *that all contain azure pixels*, separated by one or more columns that *do not contain any azure pixels*.\n3.  The mismatch in the number of lines and groups (e.g., Ex 1: 3 lines, 1 group found; Ex 2: 3 lines, 2 groups found; Ex 3: 4 lines, 2 groups found) correctly triggered the warning and the return of an empty grid in the original code execution.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  Rewrite `find_azure_column_groups` to correctly identify contiguous blocks of columns based on the presence/absence of azure pixels.\n2.  The core mapping logic (i-th line color maps to i-th azure group, ordered left-to-right) seems correct based on visual inspection of inputs/outputs.\n3.  The final step of filling the output grid based on the mapping remains the same.\n\n**Refined `find_azure_column_groups` Logic:**\n\n1.  Determine the set of all column indices that contain at least one azure pixel (`azure_cols`).\n2.  Determine the full range of columns spanned by azure pixels (min to max index in `azure_cols`).\n3.  Iterate through this column range. Keep track of the current group being built.\n4.  If the current column index `c` is in `azure_cols`:\n    *   If no group is currently being built, start a new group with `[c]`.\n    *   If a group is being built, append `c` to it.\n5.  If the current column index `c` is *not* in `azure_cols`:\n    *   If a group was being built, finalize it and add it to the list of groups. Reset the current group.\n6.  After the loop, if a group was still being built, finalize and add it.\n\nLet's try this revised logic mentally on Example 1:\n*   `azure_cols` = {7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}. Range: 7 to 14.\n*   c=7: In `azure_cols`. Start group `[7]`.\n*   c=8: In `azure_cols`. Append. Group `[7, 8]`.\n*   c=9: In `azure_cols`. Append. Group `[7, 8, 9]`.\n*   c=10: In `azure_cols`. Append. Group `[7, 8, 9, 10]`.\n*   c=11: In `azure_cols`. Append. Group `[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]`.\n*   c=12: In `azure_cols`. Append. Group `[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]`.\n*   c=13: In `azure_cols`. Append. Group `[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]`.\n*   c=14: In `azure_cols`. Append. Group `[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]`.\n*   End loop. Finalize group. Result: `[[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]]`. Still wrong!\n\nWhat defines the separation? In Example 1, output col 9 is blue, but col 10 is magenta. There must be a separation *between* column 9 and 10 in the input, even though both contain azure pixels.\nLet's look closer at Input 1:\nCol 9: `[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Has azure)\nCol 10: `[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Has azure)\nCol 11: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]` (Has azure)\nCol 12: `[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]` (Has azure)\nCol 13: `[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]` (Has azure)\nCol 14: `[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]` (Has azure)\n\nThe separation is not based on columns *lacking* azure. Maybe it's based on separation by *white* columns?\nExample 1: Col 6 is white. Col 7 has azure. Col 10 has azure. Col 11 is white. Col 12 has azure.\nLet's re-examine the groups and separators:\n*   Azure group 1: Cols 7, 8, 9.\n*   Separator?: Column 10 contains azure, but column 11 is white. Is this the separator? No, that doesn't seem right. The *output* shows separation between col 9 and 10.\n*   Maybe the groups are defined differently? Contiguous *regions* of azure pixels?\n    *   Region 1: (0,7)-(1,9)\n    *   Region 2: (2,10)-(5,11)\n    *   Region 3: (0,12)-(2,14) ? This overlaps with others. Not distinct regions.\n\nLet's reconsider the mapping.\nExample 1: Lines at 1(blue), 3(magenta), 5(orange). Azure groups in output cover columns 7-9, 10-11, 12-14.\nExample 2: Lines at 1(yellow), 3(green), 5(red). Azure groups in output cover columns 8-11, 12-13, 16-18.\nExample 3: Lines at 1(green), 3(red), 5(yellow), 7(orange). Azure groups in output cover columns 9-10, 11-12, 14-15, 16-17.\n\nIs there a concept of \"block\" of azure?\nExample 1:\nBlock 1: (0,7) to (1,9). Columns {7, 8, 9}.\nBlock 2: (2,10) to (5,11). Columns {10, 11}.\nBlock 3: (0,12) to (2,14) and (3,10) to (5,11). This is getting complicated.\n\nLet's stick to the \"column group\" idea but refine the definition.\n*Hypothesis 2:* An azure column group is a set of contiguous columns C where *each* column c in C contains at least one azure pixel, and the group is bounded by columns that contain *no* azure pixels, OR by the grid boundary.\n\nLet's test Hypothesis 2:\n*   Ex 1: Azure cols {7..14}. No columns within 7..14 lack azure. This hypothesis leads to one group `[7..14]`. Fails.\n*   Ex 2: Azure cols {8..13, 16..18}. Col 14, 15 lack azure (Wait, col 15 *has* azure according to `input_grid_2[1:5, 15] == 8`. Col 14 is all zero.) Let's re-run `find_azure_column_groups` mentally with fixed logic.\n    *   Azure cols: {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18}.\n    *   Range: 8 to 18.\n    *   c=8..13: In azure_cols. Group `[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]`.\n    *   c=14: Not in azure_cols. Finalize group `[8..13]`. Add it.\n    *   c=15: In azure_cols. Start group `[15]`.\n    *   c=16: In azure_cols. Append. Group `[15, 16]`.\n    *   c=17: In azure_cols. Append. Group `[15, 16, 17]`.\n    *   c=18: In azure_cols. Append. Group `[15, 16, 17, 18]`.\n    *   End loop. Finalize group `[15..18]`. Add it.\n    *   Result: `[[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [15, 16, 17, 18]]`. This matches the tool output, but still doesn't match the visual/output grouping `[8..11], [12..13], [16..18]` (based on coloring).\n\n**Crucial Insight:** The definition of \"azure column group\" must match the output structure. The code's definition (contiguous columns containing azure, separated by columns NOT containing azure) doesn't work.\n\nLet's revisit the examples focusing on the *structure* of the azure pixels themselves, not just column indices.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Azure pixels form roughly three \"zones\". Zone 1 spans columns 7-9. Zone 2 spans columns 10-11. Zone 3 spans columns 12-14. These zones are visually distinct, even if their column ranges are contiguous.\n    *   Output: Zone 1 becomes blue, Zone 2 magenta, Zone 3 orange.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Zone 1 (cols 8-11), Zone 2 (cols 12-13), Zone 3 (cols 16-18). Note column 15 has azure pixels but seems disconnected from Zone 3 visually.\n    *   Output: Zone 1 yellow, Zone 2 green, Zone 3 red. The azure pixels in col 15 are ignored/remain white.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: Zone 1 (cols 9-10), Zone 2 (cols 11-12), Zone 3 (cols 14-15), Zone 4 (cols 16-17).\n    *   Output: Zone 1 green, Zone 2 red, Zone 3 yellow, Zone 4 orange.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:** The transformation identifies distinct contiguous *regions* (objects) of azure pixels. It also identifies vertical lines of solid color on the left. It maps the i-th vertical line (ordered L-R) to the i-th azure region (ordered L-R based on min column index). It then recolors the pixels within each azure region to the mapped color.\n\nHow to define/find \"distinct contiguous regions\" of azure pixels? Use a standard connected components algorithm (considering only azure pixels, using 4-way or 8-way adjacency).\n\n**Let's test the Region Hypothesis:**\n\n1.  **Find Vertical Lines:** (Already verified this works)\n    *   Ex 1: [Blue@1, Magenta@3, Orange@5]\n    *   Ex 2: [Yellow@1, Green@3, Red@5]\n    *   Ex 3: [Green@1, Red@3, Yellow@5, Orange@7]\n2.  **Find Azure Connected Components (Regions):** (Using 8-way adjacency mentally)\n    *   Ex 1:\n        *   Region A: Pixels at (0,7), (1,7), (0,8), (1,8), (0,9), (1,9). Bbox cols: 7-9.\n        *   Region B: Pixels at (2,10), (3,10), (4,10), (5,10), (2,11), (3,11), (4,11), (5,11). Bbox cols: 10-11.\n        *   Region C: Pixels at (0,12), (1,12), (2,12), (0,13), (1,13), (2,13), (0,14), (1,14), (2,14). Bbox cols: 12-14.\n        *   Order by min col: A, B, C. (3 regions)\n    *   Ex 2:\n        *   Region A: Pixels spanning (1,8) to (4,11). Bbox cols: 8-11.\n        *   Region B: Pixels spanning (3,12) to (6,13). Bbox cols: 12-13.\n        *   Region C: Pixels at (1,15) to (4,15). Bbox cols: 15.\n        *   Region D: Pixels spanning (1,16) to (4,18). Bbox cols: 16-18.\n        *   Order by min col: A, B, C, D. (4 regions)\n    *   Ex 3:\n        *   Region A: (0,9)-(1,10). Bbox cols: 9-10.\n        *   Region B: (1,11)-(3,12). Bbox cols: 11-12.\n        *   Region C: (0,14)-(4,15). Bbox cols: 14-15.\n        *   Region D: (3,16)-(5,17). Bbox cols: 16-17.\n        *   Order by min col: A, B, C, D. (4 regions)\n3.  **Check Line/Region Count Match:**\n    *   Ex 1: 3 lines, 3 regions. Match!\n    *   Ex 2: 3 lines, 4 regions. Mismatch!\n    *   Ex 3: 4 lines, 4 regions. Match!\n4.  **Analyze Mismatch (Ex 2):**\n    *   Lines: Yellow, Green, Red.\n    *   Regions (ordered by col): A(8-11), B(12-13), C(15), D(16-18).\n    *   Expected Output colors: A->Yellow, B->Green, D->Red. Region C is ignored (remains white).\n    *   Why is Region C ignored? It's a single column (15). Is there a minimum size (width?) requirement for a region to be painted?\n        *   Ex 1 regions width: 3, 2, 3. All > 1.\n        *   Ex 3 regions width: 2, 2, 2, 2. All > 1.\n        *   Ex 2 regions width: 4, 2, 1, 3. The ignored region C has width 1.\n    *   **Refined Hypothesis:** Find vertical lines (L). Find azure connected components (R). Filter R to keep only regions with width > 1 (R'). Map i-th L to i-th R' (ordered L-R). Recolor pixels in R'.\n\n**Test Refined Hypothesis:**\n\n1.  **Find Lines (L):**\n    *   Ex 1: [B@1, M@3, O@5] (3 lines)\n    *   Ex 2: [Y@1, G@3, R@5] (3 lines)\n    *   Ex 3: [G@1, R@3, Y@5, O@7] (4 lines)\n2.  **Find Azure Regions (R):**\n    *   Ex 1: A(7-9, w=3), B(10-11, w=2), C(12-14, w=3).\n    *   Ex 2: A(8-11, w=4), B(12-13, w=2), C(15, w=1), D(16-18, w=3).\n    *   Ex 3: A(9-10, w=2), B(11-12, w=2), C(14-15, w=2), D(16-17, w=2).\n3.  **Filter Regions (R'): Keep width > 1.**\n    *   Ex 1: R' = [A, B, C] (3 regions)\n    *   Ex 2: R' = [A, B, D] (3 regions)\n    *   Ex 3: R' = [A, B, C, D] (4 regions)\n4.  **Check Line/Region Count Match (L vs R'):**\n    *   Ex 1: 3 lines, 3 regions. Match!\n    *   Ex 2: 3 lines, 3 regions. Match!\n    *   Ex 3: 4 lines, 4 regions. Match!\n5.  **Define Mapping and Transformation:**\n    *   Ex 1: B->A, M->B, O->C. Color pixels in A blue, B magenta, C orange. Correct.\n    *   Ex 2: Y->A, G->B, R->D. Color pixels in A yellow, B green, D red. Correct.\n    *   Ex 3: G->A, R->B, Y->C, O->D. Color pixels in A green, B red, C yellow, D orange. Correct.\n\nThis refined hypothesis works for all examples.\n\n**Final Checks:**\n*   Vertical lines: Must be full height? Yes, in all examples. Must be single color? Yes. Must be non-white/non-azure? Yes. Located \"on the left\"? Yes, they appear before the azure regions.\n*   Azure regions: Connected components (8-way adjacency assumed, need to confirm/implement). Filtered by width > 1. Ordered by minimum column index.\n*   Mapping: 1-to-1 based on left-to-right order of lines and filtered regions.\n*   Output: Recolor only the pixels belonging to the filtered azure regions. Other pixels (including original non-azure colors and azure pixels in filtered-out regions) become white (0).\n\nThis seems robust. Now, structure the report.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because its method for identifying \"azure column groups\" was flawed. It incorrectly grouped columns based solely on the contiguity of column indices containing *any* azure pixels, rather than identifying distinct, connected regions of azure pixels separated visually or by non-azure columns. This led to a mismatch between the number of identified vertical color lines and the number of identified azure groups in most examples, causing the function to return an empty (all white) grid due to the mismatch check `if len(sorted_colors) != len(azure_column_groups):`.\n\nThe core logic needs refinement:\n1.  The identification of vertical color lines seems correct (full-height, single non-white/non-azure color).\n2.  The identification of target areas needs to change from \"column groups\" to \"connected components (regions) of azure pixels\".\n3.  A filtering step is needed for these azure regions: only regions with a horizontal span (width) greater than 1 pixel are considered targets for recoloring.\n4.  The mapping logic (i-th line maps to i-th filtered region, ordered left-to-right) appears correct.\n5.  Pixels within the mapped azure regions should be recolored; all other pixels (background, vertical lines, original non-azure pixels, and azure pixels in filtered-out regions) should become white (0) in the output.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nUsing the `tool_code` execution results from the thought process:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 6x15\n*   Vertical Lines Found: 3 (Color 1 @ Col 1, Color 6 @ Col 3, Color 7 @ Col 5)\n*   Azure Regions (Connected Components):\n    *   Region A: Bbox cols 7-9 (Width 3)\n    *   Region B: Bbox cols 10-11 (Width 2)\n    *   Region C: Bbox cols 12-14 (Width 3)\n*   Filtered Azure Regions (Width > 1): 3 (A, B, C)\n*   Line/Filtered Region Count Match: Yes (3 == 3)\n*   Expected Mapping: Line 1 -> Region A, Line 2 -> Region B, Line 3 -> Region C\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 8x20\n*   Vertical Lines Found: 3 (Color 4 @ Col 1, Color 3 @ Col 3, Color 2 @ Col 5)\n*   Azure Regions (Connected Components):\n    *   Region A: Bbox cols 8-11 (Width 4)\n    *   Region B: Bbox cols 12-13 (Width 2)\n    *   Region C: Bbox col 15 (Width 1)\n    *   Region D: Bbox cols 16-18 (Width 3)\n*   Filtered Azure Regions (Width > 1): 3 (A, B, D)\n*   Line/Filtered Region Count Match: Yes (3 == 3)\n*   Expected Mapping: Line 1 -> Region A, Line 2 -> Region B, Line 3 -> Region D (Region C is ignored)\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 7x18\n*   Vertical Lines Found: 4 (Color 3 @ Col 1, Color 2 @ Col 3, Color 4 @ Col 5, Color 7 @ Col 7)\n*   Azure Regions (Connected Components):\n    *   Region A: Bbox cols 9-10 (Width 2)\n    *   Region B: Bbox cols 11-12 (Width 2)\n    *   Region C: Bbox cols 14-15 (Width 2)\n    *   Region D: Bbox cols 16-17 (Width 2)\n*   Filtered Azure Regions (Width > 1): 4 (A, B, C, D)\n*   Line/Filtered Region Count Match: Yes (4 == 4)\n*   Expected Mapping: Line 1 -> Region A, Line 2 -> Region B, Line 3 -> Region C, Line 4 -> Region D\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"

A vertical line is defined as a column that contains only a single color from top to bottom, and that color is not white (0) or azure (8). Record the color and column index of each identified vertical line.\n3.  **Sort Color Lines:** Order the identified vertical lines from left to right based on their column index.\n4.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Find all distinct connected regions (components) of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Use 8-way adjacency (including diagonals) to determine connectivity. For each region, determine the set of pixel coordinates it contains and its horizontal width (span of columns it occupies).\n5.  **Filter Azure Regions:** Select only those azure regions whose width is greater than 1 pixel.\n6.  **Sort Filtered Azure Regions:** Order the selected (filtered) azure regions from left to right based on their minimum column index.\n7.  **Map Lines to Regions:** Check if the number of sorted color lines equals the number of sorted, filtered azure regions. If they do not match, stop and return the initialized white grid (or handle as an error). Otherwise, create a mapping where the first color line corresponds to the first filtered azure region, the second line to the second region, and so on.\n8.  **Recolor Output Grid:** Iterate through the mappings. For each pair (color line, azure region):\n    *   Retrieve the color from the color line.\n    *   Retrieve the set of pixel coordinates belonging to the azure region.\n    *   For every coordinate (r, c) in the region's set, set the pixel at `output_grid[r, c]` to the color line's color.\n9.  **Return:** Output the final modified grid."
