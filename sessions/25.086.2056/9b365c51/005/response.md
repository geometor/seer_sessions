"""
Recolor regions of azure pixels based on a sequence of vertical color lines.

1.  Initialize a white output grid of the same size as the input.
2.  Identify full-height vertical lines of a single, non-white(0)/non-azure(8) color on the left. Sort them left-to-right by column index. Let N be the number of lines.
3.  Identify all maximal contiguous horizontal segments of azure(8) pixels in each row.
4.  Group these azure segments based on their starting column index.
5.  Sort these groups based on their starting column index, from left to right. Let M be the number of groups.
6.  If N equals M, then for the i-th sorted line and i-th sorted segment group:
    a.  Get the color C from the i-th line.
    b.  For every segment (r, c_start, c_end) in the i-th group, color the pixels in the output grid from (r, c_start) to (r, c_end) with color C.
7.  If N does not equal M, the output grid remains white.
8.  Return the output grid.
