Common elements include:\n    *   A white background (color 0).\n    *   One or more distinct colored shapes (lines, rectangles).\n    *   Sometimes gray shapes (color 5) are present.\n2.  **Output:** The outputs are smaller, square grids.\n    *   Each output grid contains only the non-white, non-gray colors found in the input shapes.\n    *   The size of the output grid (NxN) corresponds to the number (N) of unique non-white, non-gray colors in the input.\n    *   The arrangement of colors in the output depends on the orientation of the shapes in the input.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves:\n    *   Identifying the relevant colors (excluding white and gray).\n    *   Determining the order of these colors based on their position (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right) in the input grid.\n    *   Detecting the dominant orientation of the colored shapes (primarily vertical or primarily horizontal/mixed).\n    *   Constructing a square output grid whose size matches the number of relevant colors.\n    *   Filling the output grid row-wise or column-wise based on the detected orientation and the determined color order.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Let N be the count of these unique relevant colors.\n2.  For each relevant color, find the coordinate (row, column) of its first appearance in the input grid (scanning top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).\n3.  Sort the relevant colors based on these first appearance coordinates (primarily by row index, secondarily by column index).\n4.  Identify all contiguous objects formed by the relevant colors in the input grid.\n5.  Determine the overall orientation: Check if *every* identified object has a height greater than or equal to its width. If this condition is true for all objects, the orientation is 'Vertical'. Otherwise, the orientation is 'Horizontal'.\n6.  Create a new square grid of size N x N.\n7.  If the orientation is 'Vertical', then for each color `C` at index `j` (0-based) in the sorted list, fill the entire `j`-th column of the output grid with color `C`.\n8.  If the orientation is 'Horizontal', then for each color `C` at index `i` (0-based) in the sorted list, fill the entire `i`-th row of the output grid with color `C`.\n9.
