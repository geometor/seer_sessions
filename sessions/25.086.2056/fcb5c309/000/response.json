Each input seems to have:\n    *   A white background (0).\n    *   One or more large, contiguous shapes of a single color (e.g., blue 'L's in Ex 1, red 'L's in Ex 2, green 'U' shapes in Ex 3).\n    *   Several scattered pixels (or very small shapes) of another distinct color (e.g., green in Ex 1, yellow in Ex 2, red in Ex 3).\n2.  **Outputs:** The output grids are smaller than the inputs (6x7 or 7x7). They depict a numerical digit shape.\n    *   The digit shape is formed using the color of the scattered pixels from the input.\n    *   The background of the output grid is white (0).\n    *   The specific digit drawn corresponds to the *numerical value* of the scattered pixels' color (e.g., scattered green (3) -> digit '3'; scattered yellow (4) -> digit '4'; scattered red (2) -> digit '2').\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the color of the 'scattered' pixels and using that color's numerical value to select and draw a specific digit pattern using that same color. The large shapes in the input seem to serve only to distinguish the 'scattered' pixels \u2013 the scattered color is the one *not* forming the largest object(s).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
