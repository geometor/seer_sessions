            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grids:** The inputs are relatively large grids (16x16 in the examples) predominantly filled with a single background color (orange, value 7). Scattered within the grid are pixels of other colors. These non-background pixels often form diagonal line segments or parts of horizontal lines, typically near the bottom.\n2.  **Output Grids:** The outputs are consistently small grids (5x3). Each row in the output grid is composed of a single solid color.\n3.  **Color Correspondence:** The colors present in the output rows correspond to the non-background colors found in the input grid.\n4.  **Order of Colors:** The vertical order of the colored rows in the output grid appears related to the vertical position where those colors first appear in the input grid. Specifically, colors that appear in higher rows (smaller row index) in the input seem to correspond to rows higher up in the output grid, but there's a twist.\n5.  **Background Color Role:** The background color (orange) from the input also appears in the output, specifically when the number of unique non-background colors in the input is less than 5. It seems to act as a padding color at the top of the output grid.\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation involves identifying the unique non-background colors, determining their first appearance row, sorting them based on this row, and then constructing a 5x3 output grid. The sorted colors fill the output grid rows from bottom to top. If there are fewer than 5 unique non-background colors, the remaining top rows are filled with the input's background color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify all unique colors present in the input grid that are *not* the background color.\n3.  For each unique non-background color found, find the smallest row index (topmost row) where this color appears anywhere in the input grid.\n4.  Create a list of these unique non-background colors, sorted according to their minimum row index (from smallest index to largest). Let N be the number of colors in this sorted list.\n5.  Create a new output grid with dimensions 5 rows by 3 columns.\n6.  Fill the top (5 - N) rows of the output grid entirely with the background color identified in step 1.\n7.  Fill the subsequent N rows of the output grid (from top to bottom) using the sorted list of colors from step 4. The first color in the sorted list fills the (5 - N)-th row (0-indexed), the second color fills the (5 - N + 1)-th row, and so on, until the last color fills the 4th row (bottom row). Each row should be filled entirely with its assigned color.\n8.  Return the generated 5x3 grid."
