Boundary Contact: Checks if any pixel belonging to this region lies on the outermost border (top, bottom, left, or right edge) of the grid.\nb. Adjacent Colors: Finds all non-'white' pixels that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to any pixel within this 'white' region. Collects the set of unique colors of these adjacent non-'white' pixels.\n\nExamines the properties for each 'white' region:\na. If a 'white' region does not have Boundary Contact (i.e., it is fully enclosed within the grid) AND its set of Adjacent Colors contains only 'azure' (8), then this region qualifies for transformation.\nb. If a 'white' region touches the boundary, or if its adjacent non-'white' neighbors include colors other than 'azure', or if it has no non-'white' neighbors, it does not qualify.\n\nCreates the output grid:\na. For every 'white' region that qualifies for transformation (met conditions above), changes the color of all pixels within that region to 'green' (3).\nb. All other pixels (those in non-qualifying 'white' regions, and all non-'white' pixels) retain their original color from the input grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define colors (using names for clarity in the code)\nWHITE = 0\nGREEN = 3\nAZURE = 8\n\ndef _find_and_analyze_white_region(input_grid, visited, start_r, start_c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs BFS starting from (start_r, start_c) to find a connected white region.\n    Analyzes if the region touches the boundary and collects adjacent non-white colors.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: The input grid (list of lists).\n        visited: A grid (list of lists) tracking visited white cells.\n        start_r: The starting row for the BFS.\n        start_c: The starting column for the BFS.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple: (region_coords, touches_boundary, neighbor_colors)\n        - region_coords: A list of (r, c) tuples for all pixels in the region.\n        - touches_boundary: Boolean, True if the region touches the grid edge.\n        - neighbor_colors: A set of colors adjacent to the region (excluding white).\n    \"\"\"\n    height = len(input_grid)\n    width = len(input_grid[0])\n\n    region_coords = []\n    touches_boundary = False\n    neighbor_colors = set()\n    queue = collections.deque([(start_r, start_c)])\n    visited[start_r][start_c] = True # Mark starting cell as visited\n\n    while queue:\n        curr_r, curr_c = queue.popleft()\n        region_coords.append((curr_r, curr_c))\n\n        # Check boundary contact\n        if curr_r == 0 or curr_r == height - 1 or curr_c == 0 or curr_c == width - 1:\n            touches_boundary = True\n\n        # Explore neighbors (4 directions: up, down, left, right)\n        for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n            nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n\n            # Check if neighbor is within grid bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                neighbor_color = input_grid[nr][nc]\n                # If neighbor is white and not visited, add to queue and mark visited\n                if neighbor_color == WHITE:\n                    if not visited[nr][nc]:\n                         visited[nr][nc] = True\n                         queue.append((nr, nc))\n                # If neighbor is not white, record its color\n                else: # neighbor_color != WHITE\n                    neighbor_colors.add(neighbor_color)\n            # Neighbor outside bounds implicitly handled by boundary check within the loop for the current cell (curr_r, curr_c)\n            # If the current cell is on the boundary, touches_boundary is already set True.\n\n    return region_coords, touches_boundary, neighbor_colors\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on enclosed white regions bordered only by azure.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists or numpy array representing the input grid (integers 0-9).\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to list of lists if it's a numpy array\n    if isinstance(input_grid, np.ndarray):\n        grid_list = input_grid.tolist()\n    else:\n        # Assume it's already list-like (e.g., list of lists)\n        # Create a deep copy to avoid modifying the original input if it's mutable\n        grid_list = [row[:] for row in input_grid]\n\n    # Handle empty grid case\n    if not grid_list or not grid_list[0]:\n        return []\n\n    height = len(grid_list)\n    width = len(grid_list[0])\n\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input list of lists\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in grid_list]\n\n    # Visited grid to keep track of processed white pixels during BFS\n    visited = [[False for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]\n\n    # Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # If a white cell is found that hasn't been processed yet\n            if grid_list[r][c] == WHITE and not visited[r][c]:\n                # Find the connected white region and analyze its properties using BFS\n                region_coords, touches_boundary, neighbor_colors = \\\n                    _find_and_analyze_white_region(grid_list, visited, r, c)\n\n                # Check if the conditions for transformation are met:\n                # 1.
