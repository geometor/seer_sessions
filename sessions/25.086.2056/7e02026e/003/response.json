All non-white pixels immediately adjacent (4-directionally) to any pixel \n   within the region are 'azure' (8).\nIf both conditions are met, all pixels within that 'white' region are changed \nto 'green' (3) in the output grid. All other pixels retain their original color.\n\nThe process involves iterating through each cell of the grid. If a 'white' cell \nis found that hasn't been processed yet, a Breadth-First Search (BFS) is initiated \nto find all connected 'white' cells forming a region. During the BFS, it tracks \nwhether any cell in the region touches the grid boundary and collects the colors \nof all adjacent non-white neighbor cells. After the BFS for a region completes, \nit checks if the boundary was touched and if the set of non-white neighbor colors \ncontains *only* 'azure'. If these conditions hold, the region's color is changed \nto 'green' in the output. A 'visited' grid ensures each 'white' cell is processed \nonly once.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport collections\nimport copy # Although not strictly needed with list comprehension for this case\n\n# Define colors (using names for clarity in the code)\nWHITE = 0\nGREEN = 3\nAZURE = 8\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on enclosed white regions bordered only by azure.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid (integers 0-9).\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Handle empty grid case\n    if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:\n        return []\n        \n    height = len(input_grid)\n    width = len(input_grid[0])\n    \n    # Create a copy of the input grid to modify.\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid] \n    \n    # Visited grid to keep track of processed white pixels during BFS.\n    visited = [[False for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]\n\n    # Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check if the cell is white (0) and hasn't been visited yet\n            if input_grid[r][c] == WHITE and not visited[r][c]:\n                \n                current_region_coords = []  # Stores coordinates (r, c) of pixels in this white region\n                touches_boundary = False    # Flag: True if any pixel in the region touches the grid edge\n                neighbor_colors = set()     # Stores colors of adjacent non-white pixels\n                \n                queue = collections.deque([(r, c)]) # Initialize queue for BFS\n                visited[r][c] = True                # Mark starting cell as visited\n                \n                # --- Start BFS to find the connected white region and analyze its surroundings ---\n                while queue:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = queue.popleft()\n                    \n                    # Add current cell coordinates to the list for this region\n                    current_region_coords.append((curr_r, curr_c))\n                    \n                    # Check if this white cell is on the grid boundary\n                    if curr_r == 0 or curr_r == height - 1 or curr_c == 0 or curr_c == width - 1:\n                        touches_boundary = True \n                        # Note: We continue BFS to mark all connected white cells visited,\n                        # even if we already know it touches the boundary or has wrong neighbors.\n\n                    # Explore neighbors (4 directions: up, down, left, right)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n                        \n                        # Check if the neighbor's coordinates are within the grid bounds\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                            neighbor_color = input_grid[nr][nc]\n                            # If the neighbor is also white and hasn't been visited yet\n                            if neighbor_color == WHITE and not visited[nr][nc]:\n                                visited[nr][nc] = True\n                                queue.append((nr, nc))\n                            # If the neighbor is NOT white\n                            elif neighbor_color != WHITE:\n                                # Record the color of this non-white neighbor\n                                neighbor_colors.add(neighbor_color)\n                        # else: Neighbor is outside the grid bounds (implicitly handled by boundary check later)\n                        \n                # --- End BFS for the current white region ---\n\n                # --- Condition Check and Transformation ---\n                # After exploring the entire connected white region:\n                # Check if:\n                # 1.
