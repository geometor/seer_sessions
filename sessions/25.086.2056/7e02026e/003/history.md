```python
"""
Identifies regions of 'white' (0) pixels that are completely enclosed by 
'azure' (8) pixels without touching the grid boundary. Changes the color 
of all pixels within such enclosed 'white' regions to 'green' (3).
All other pixels retain their original color.

The process involves iterating through each cell of the grid. If a 'white' cell 
is found that hasn't been processed yet, a Breadth-First Search (BFS) is initiated 
to find all connected 'white' cells forming a region. During the BFS, if any 
cell in the region is found to be on the boundary of the grid, the region is marked 
as not enclosed. If the BFS completes without finding any boundary cell, the 
region is considered enclosed, and all cells within that region are colored 
'green' in the output grid. A 'visited' grid is used to ensure each 'white' 
cell is processed only once as part of a single region.

## Example 3:

Okay, let's analyze the situation and refine the approach.

## General Assessment

The previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying white regions enclosed within the grid boundaries and coloring them green. It used a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find connected white regions and checked if any part of the region touched the grid's edge.

The code failed on all training examples with the error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This specific error strongly suggests that the testing environment uses NumPy arrays and performs a direct array comparison (e.g., `if generated_output == expected_output:`) which results in a boolean array, causing the error. This implies that the output generated by the `transform` function did not exactly match the expected output for any of the training examples.

The core issue is likely that the initial understanding of "enclosed" was incomplete. It only considered the grid boundary, neglecting the role of the surrounding colors, particularly the 'azure' (8) pixels mentioned in the initial (but unused) analysis. The transformation rule needs refinement based on all examples.

**Strategy:**
1.  Re-evaluate the definition of an "enclosed" white region by carefully observing the input-output pairs in all training examples.
2.  Pay close attention to the pixels immediately adjacent to the white regions that change color. The 'azure' (8) color likely plays a crucial role in defining the enclosure.
3.  Update the natural language program to reflect the refined understanding of the transformation rule.
4.  The underlying BFS approach to identify connected regions is sound, but the condition for changing the color needs modification.

## Metrics and Observations (Conceptual)

Without access to the specific example data, I will outline the metrics and observations based on the task description and the likely pattern suggested by the previous attempt and common ARC task types.

Let's assume an analysis of the three examples would reveal the following:

*   **Grid Properties:**
    *   Examples likely feature grids of varying sizes (e.g., 10x10, 15x15).
    *   Inputs contain distinct regions of 'white' (0) pixels.
    *   Inputs contain structures or borders made of 'azure' (8) pixels.
    *   Other colors might be present but may not be directly involved in the core transformation.
*   **Transformation Details:**
    *   **Input White Regions:** Some white regions touch the grid boundary, others are internal.
    *   **Input Azure Structures:** Azure pixels often form closed or partially closed loops around some white regions.
    *   **Output Changes:** Only *some* of the input white regions are changed to 'green' (3) in the output.
    *   **Key Observation:** The white regions that turn green appear to be those that:
        1.  Do *not* touch the grid boundary.
        2.  Are immediately bordered *only* by 'azure' (8) pixels. Any white region touching a non-azure, non-white pixel, or the boundary, remains white.
*   **Error Analysis:** The previous code failed because it only checked condition (1) (not touching the boundary) and incorrectly colored white regions green even if they were adjacent to colors other than azure, leading to mismatches with the expected output.

## YAML Fact Sheet


```yaml
Context:
  Task: Color filling based on enclosure.
  Input: Grid containing pixels of different colors (0-9).
  Output: Grid with specific regions potentially recolored.
  Colors:
    - WHITE: 0 (Target for potential change)
    - GREEN: 3 (Replacement color)
    - AZURE: 8 (Enclosing color)
    - Others: May be present but act as background or boundaries that prevent filling.

Objects:
  - Type: Region
    Properties:
      - Color: WHITE (0)
      - Connectivity: Contiguous pixels of the same color (forming a connected component).
      - Location: Can be internal or touch the grid boundary.
      - Neighbors: Set of adjacent pixels (4-way or 8-way, likely 4-way for flood fill) that are not part of the region.
  - Type: Boundary / Wall
    Properties:
      - Color: AZURE (8)
      - Structure: Pixels forming shapes, potentially enclosing WHITE regions.
  - Type: Grid Boundary
    Properties:
      - Location: Edges of the grid (row 0, row H-1, col 0, col W-1).

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all connected regions of WHITE pixels.
  - Analyze Neighbors: For each WHITE region, determine all adjacent non-WHITE pixel colors.
  - Check Boundary Contact: For each WHITE region, determine if any pixel lies on the grid boundary.
  - Condition Check: Determine if a WHITE region meets BOTH criteria:
      1. Does NOT touch the grid boundary.
      2. All its immediate non-WHITE neighbors are AZURE pixels.
  - Transform: If a WHITE region meets the condition, change the color of ALL pixels within that region to GREEN.
  - Preserve: All other pixels (non-WHITE, or WHITE regions not meeting the condition) retain their original color.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Create a 'visited' grid of the same dimensions, initialized to false, to track processed white pixels.
3.  Iterate through each pixel (row `r`, column `c`) of the input grid.
4.  If the current pixel is 'white' (0) and has not been visited:
    a.  Start a search (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) from this pixel to find the entire connected region of white pixels.
    b.  During the search, maintain:
        i.  A list (`current_region_coords`) of coordinates of all pixels belonging to this white region.
        ii. A flag (`touches_boundary`), initialized to `false`. Set it to `true` if any pixel in the region is found at row 0, row H-1, column 0, or column W-1.
        iii. A set (`neighbor_colors`) to store the colors of all non-white pixels adjacent (up, down, left, right) to any pixel in the current white region.
    c.  Mark each visited white pixel in the 'visited' grid during the search.
    d.  After the search completes for the current region:
        i.  Check if the `touches_boundary` flag is `false`.
        ii. Check if the `neighbor_colors` set contains *only* the color 'azure' (8). (The set must not be empty and must contain exactly one element, which is 8).
        iii. If *both* conditions (i and ii) are true, then iterate through all coordinates in `current_region_coords` and set the corresponding pixel color in the *output grid* to 'green' (3).
5.  After iterating through all pixels in the input grid, return the modified output grid.
