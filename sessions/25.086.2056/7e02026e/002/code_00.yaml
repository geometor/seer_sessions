Context:
  Task: Color filling based on enclosure.
  Input: Grid containing pixels of different colors (0-9).
  Output: Grid with specific regions potentially recolored.
  Colors:
    - WHITE: 0 (Target for potential change)
    - GREEN: 3 (Replacement color)
    - AZURE: 8 (Enclosing color)
    - Others: May be present but act as background or boundaries that prevent filling.

Objects:
  - Type: Region
    Properties:
      - Color: WHITE (0)
      - Connectivity: Contiguous pixels of the same color (forming a connected component).
      - Location: Can be internal or touch the grid boundary.
      - Neighbors: Set of adjacent pixels (4-way or 8-way, likely 4-way for flood fill) that are not part of the region.
  - Type: Boundary / Wall
    Properties:
      - Color: AZURE (8)
      - Structure: Pixels forming shapes, potentially enclosing WHITE regions.
  - Type: Grid Boundary
    Properties:
      - Location: Edges of the grid (row 0, row H-1, col 0, col W-1).

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all connected regions of WHITE pixels.
  - Analyze Neighbors: For each WHITE region, determine all adjacent non-WHITE pixel colors.
  - Check Boundary Contact: For each WHITE region, determine if any pixel lies on the grid boundary.
  - Condition Check: Determine if a WHITE region meets BOTH criteria:
      1. Does NOT touch the grid boundary.
      2. All its immediate non-WHITE neighbors are AZURE pixels.
  - Transform: If a WHITE region meets the condition, change the color of ALL pixels within that region to GREEN.
  - Preserve: All other pixels (non-WHITE, or WHITE regions not meeting the condition) retain their original color.
