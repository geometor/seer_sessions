"""
Identifies regions of 'white' (0) pixels that are completely enclosed by 
'azure' (8) pixels without touching the grid boundary. Changes the color 
of all pixels within such enclosed 'white' regions to 'green' (3).
All other pixels retain their original color.

The process involves iterating through each cell of the grid. If a 'white' cell 
is found that hasn't been processed yet, a Breadth-First Search (BFS) is initiated 
to find all connected 'white' cells forming a region. During the BFS, if any 
cell in the region is found to be on the boundary of the grid, the region is marked 
as not enclosed. If the BFS completes without finding any boundary cell, the 
region is considered enclosed, and all cells within that region are colored 
'green' in the output grid. A 'visited' grid is used to ensure each 'white' 
cell is processed only once as part of a single region.
