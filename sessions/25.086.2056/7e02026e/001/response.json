Changes the color \nof all pixels within such enclosed 'white' regions to 'green' (3).\nAll other pixels retain their original color.\n\nThe process involves iterating through each cell of the grid. If a 'white' cell \nis found that hasn't been processed yet, a Breadth-First Search (BFS) is initiated \nto find all connected 'white' cells forming a region. During the BFS, if any \ncell in the region is found to be on the boundary of the grid, the region is marked \nas not enclosed. If the BFS completes without finding any boundary cell, the \nregion is considered enclosed, and all cells within that region are colored \n'green' in the output grid. A 'visited' grid is used to ensure each 'white' \ncell is processed only once as part of a single region.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport collections\nimport copy\n\n# Define colors (using names for clarity in the code)\nWHITE = 0\nGREEN = 3\nAZURE = 8 # Although not explicitly checked against, AZURE is the enclosing color\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by finding enclosed white regions and coloring them green.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid (integers 0-9).\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Handle empty grid case\n    if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:\n        return []\n        \n    height = len(input_grid)\n    width = len(input_grid[0])\n    \n    # Create a copy of the input grid to modify.\n    # List comprehension with slicing creates a deep enough copy for a 2D list of immutable integers.\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid] \n    \n    # Visited grid to keep track of processed white pixels during BFS.\n    # Prevents redundant searches for the same region.\n    visited = [[False for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]\n\n    # Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check if the cell is white (0) and hasn't been visited as part of a region search yet\n            if input_grid[r][c] == WHITE and not visited[r][c]:\n                \n                current_region_coords = []  # Stores coordinates (r, c) of pixels in the current white region\n                is_enclosed = True         # Flag: Assume region is enclosed until a boundary cell is found\n                queue = collections.deque([(r, c)]) # Initialize queue for Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n                \n                # Mark the starting cell as visited\n                visited[r][c] = True\n                \n                # --- Start BFS to find the connected white region ---\n                while queue:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = queue.popleft()\n                    \n                    # Add current cell coordinates to the list for this region\n                    current_region_coords.append((curr_r, curr_c))\n                    \n                    # Crucial Check: If this white cell is on the grid boundary, the region is not enclosed\n                    if curr_r == 0 or curr_r == height - 1 or curr_c == 0 or curr_c == width - 1:\n                        is_enclosed = False \n                        # Note: We continue the BFS even if not enclosed to ensure all parts of this\n                        # connected region are marked as visited, preventing re-processing.\n\n                    # Explore neighbors (4 directions: up, down, left, right)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n                        \n                        # Check if the neighbor's coordinates are within the grid bounds\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                            # If the neighbor is also white and hasn't been visited yet\n                            if input_grid[nr][nc] == WHITE and not visited[nr][nc]:\n                                # Mark it as visited\n                                visited[nr][nc] = True\n                                # Add it to the queue to explore its neighbors later\n                                queue.append((nr, nc))\n                # --- End BFS for the current white region ---\n\n                # After exploring the entire connected white region starting from (r, c):\n                # If the 'is_enclosed' flag is still True (meaning no part of the region touched the boundary)\n                if is_enclosed:\n                    # Iterate through all the coordinates saved for this enclosed region\n                    for pr, pc in current_region_coords:\n                        # Change the color of these pixels to green (3) in the output grid\n                        output_grid[pr][pc] = GREEN\n                        \n    # Return the modified grid\n    return output_grid\n```"
