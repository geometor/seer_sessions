            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code attempts to solve the task by identifying contiguous white regions, checking if they are enclosed within the grid boundaries, and examining the colors of their immediate non-white neighbors. If a white region is enclosed and bordered *exclusively* by azure (8) pixels, it is colored green (3) in the output. All other pixels retain their original colors.\n\nThe code failed on all training examples with the error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly indicates that the input grids are being passed as NumPy arrays, while the code's logic (especially the initial empty grid check `if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:`) and internal data structures (lists, collections.deque) are designed for Python lists of lists.\n\n## Strategy for Resolution\n\n1.  **Input Type Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to detect if the input is a NumPy array. If it is, convert it to a standard Python list of lists at the beginning. This ensures compatibility with the existing list-based logic (BFS, coordinate storage, neighbor checking).\n2.  **Maintain Internal Consistency:** Continue using lists and standard Python collections for internal processing (finding regions, tracking visited cells, storing coordinates, collecting neighbor colors).\n3.  **Output Type:** Return the result as a list of lists, as this is consistent with the internal processing. If the testing environment specifically requires a NumPy array output, the calling context or a final conversion step should handle that.\n4.  **Logic Verification:** Once the type error is resolved, re-run the code on the examples. If errors persist or outputs are incorrect, re-evaluate the core logic against all examples to ensure the understanding of \"enclosed\" and \"bordered only by azure\" is correct and covers all edge cases (e.g., regions with no non-white neighbors).\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nAs the code execution failed due to a type error, we cannot gather metrics from the failed runs. We must rely on analyzing the task's input/output examples directly to confirm the transformation rule.\n\nLet's define the properties we need to check for each example:\n\n*   Input/Output Grid Dimensions.\n*   Identification of all distinct contiguous white (0) regions in the input.\n*   For each white region:\n    *   `coords`: List of (row, col) tuples.\n    *   `touches_boundary`: Boolean (True if any coord is on row 0, last row, col 0, or last col).\n    *   `neighbor_colors`: Set of unique colors adjacent (4-directionally) to the region, excluding white (0).\n*   Identify which input white regions correspond to green (3) regions in the output.\n*   Verify if the green regions in the output match the input white regions where `touches_boundary` is `False` and `neighbor_colors` is exactly `{8}` (azure).\n\n(Self-correction: Since I cannot execute code here to perform this analysis automatically on the actual examples, this analysis plan remains hypothetical until the code can run.)\n\n## YAML Documentation\n\n"
