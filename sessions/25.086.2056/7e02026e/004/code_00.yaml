# Based on the provided code's intended logic - VERIFICATION PENDING DATA AVAILABILITY

Objects:
  - type: Region
    description: A contiguous area of pixels of the same color.
    identified_by: Contiguous pixels of WHITE (0).

Properties:
  - object_type: Region (White)
    property: Boundary Contact
    value: Boolean (True if any pixel in the region is on the grid edge, False otherwise).
  - object_type: Region (White)
    property: Adjacent Non-White Colors
    value: Set of colors of all non-WHITE pixels directly adjacent (4-directionally) to any pixel within the white region.

Actions:
  - name: Conditional Fill
    condition: Applies to a WHITE (0) Region IF:
                 1. Boundary Contact is False.
                 2. Adjacent Non-White Colors is exactly the set {AZURE (8)}.
    effect: Changes the color of all pixels within the qualifying WHITE Region to GREEN (3).
    target: Pixels within the identified WHITE region.
  - name: No Change
    condition: Applies to all pixels not part of a WHITE Region meeting the Conditional Fill criteria.
    effect: Pixel color remains the same as in the input grid.
    target: All other pixels.

Grid_Properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True (Output grid has the same height and width as the input grid).
  - background_color: Not explicitly defined, WHITE (0) seems to be the focus for transformation.
