Task: Draw connecting lines based on color correspondence between peripheral pixels and a central structure.

Elements:
  - Type: Grid
    Properties: 2D array of integer colors (0-9).
  - Type: Object
    Name: Central Structure
    Description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels in the first row (row 0).
    Properties:
      - start_column: Integer
      - end_column: Integer
      - colors: List of colors corresponding to columns.
  - Type: Object
    Name: Peripheral Pixel
    Description: Any non-white pixel not part of the Central Structure.
    Properties:
      - row: Integer
      - column: Integer
      - color: Integer
      - target_column: Integer (column index in Central Structure with the same color)

Relationships:
  - Peripheral Pixels are linked to the Central Structure based on matching color.
  - The vertical extent of replication for the Central Structure depends on the minimum row of any Peripheral Pixel.
  - The vertical extent of lines drawn downwards from the Central Structure depends on the maximum row of corresponding Peripheral Pixels (or grid height if none exist).

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate Central Structure and Peripheral Pixels.
  - Associate: Determine the target_column for each Peripheral Pixel.
  - Draw Horizontal Line: Fill pixels horizontally between a Peripheral Pixel and its target column (excluding the target column itself).
  - Draw Vertical Line: Fill pixels vertically from a Central Structure column down to the row of its associated Peripheral Pixel (or grid bottom).
  - Replicate: Copy the Central Structure pattern vertically downwards to fill rows above the topmost Peripheral Pixel.
  - Combine: The output is the union of original pixels and drawn lines/replications.
