The grid dimensions remain unchanged between input and output for each example (13x13 for train_1, 13x16 for train_2).\n2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and gray (5). Each input example features exactly one pixel of a distinct color (blue=1 in train_1, green=3 in train_2). The output grids contain the same set of colors as their corresponding inputs.\n3.  **Transformation Core:** The key transformation involves changing some white (0) pixels to the unique color present in the input (blue or green). Gray (5) pixels and the original unique colored pixel remain unchanged.\n4.  **Pattern Identification:** The locations where white pixels are changed follow a grid-like pattern based on the parity (even/odd) of the row and column indices. This parity pattern seems directly linked to the parity of the row and column indices of the unique colored pixel in the input grid.\n5.  **Rule Hypothesis:** The transformation identifies the unique non-white, non-gray pixel (let's call it the 'target pixel' with 'target color'). It determines the parity (even/odd) of the target pixel's row and column coordinates. Then, it iterates through the grid, changing any white (0) pixel to the 'target color' *if and only if* its row parity matches the target pixel's row parity AND its column parity matches the target pixel's column parity. All other pixels retain their original color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
