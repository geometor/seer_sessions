objects:
  - object_type: target_pixel
    description: A single pixel in the input grid whose color is neither white (0) nor gray (5).
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example (e.g., blue=1, green=3). Let's call this 'target_color'.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates within the grid. Let's call this ('target_row', 'target_col').
      - count: Exactly one per input grid.
    role: Determines the color and location pattern for the transformation.
  - object_type: background_pixels
    description: Pixels with the background color (white=0).
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
    role: Some of these pixels are targets for color change.
relationships:
  - relation: parity_matching
    description: >
      The transformation depends on matching the parity (even/odd) of a white pixel's
      row and column indices with the parity of the target_pixel's row and column indices.
    condition: Applies only to white (0) pixels.
    source: target_pixel (its row/col parity)
    target: background_pixels (white=0)
actions:
  - action: find_target_pixel
    description: Locate the unique pixel in the input grid that is not white (0) or gray (5). Record its color ('target_color') and position ('target_row', 'target_col').
  - action: determine_parity_rule
    description: >
      Determine the required parity for rows (even/odd based on 'target_row') and
      columns (even/odd based on 'target_col').
  - action: apply_color_change
    description: >
      Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel is white (0) AND
      its row index parity matches the target row parity AND its column index parity
      matches the target column parity, change its color to 'target_color' in the
      output grid. Otherwise, copy the input pixel's color to the output grid.
