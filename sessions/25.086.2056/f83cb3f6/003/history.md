## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided code attempts to implement a transformation based on identifying a horizontal azure line and having pixels above it fall down onto it. However, the results show significant deviations from the expected outputs across all training examples.

**Key Issues:**

1.  **Azure Line Identification:** The `find_azure_line_row` function seems flawed.
    *   In Example 1, it incorrectly identifies row 9 as the azure line instead of row 8. The expected output has the azure line at row 8.
    *   In Example 2, it correctly identifies row 8, which matches the expected output.
    *   In Example 3, it correctly identifies row 7, matching the expected output. However, the existing logic might be too complex and fail on other variations (e.g., multiple potential lines). The critical characteristic seems to be the *lowest* horizontal line primarily composed of azure pixels, potentially allowing for white gaps.
2.  **Pixel Falling Logic:** The current implementation collects all non-white/non-azure pixels above the line in a column and stacks them. The expected outputs suggest a simpler rule: only the pixels *directly adjacent* (above) the azure line are preserved and placed in the row immediately above the azure line in the output. Pixels further above the line are discarded.
3.  **Pixel Removal Logic:** The code fails to remove pixels below the identified azure line. The expected outputs consistently show the area below the azure line as entirely white.
4.  **Output Grid Initialization:** The code initializes the output grid with zeros (white) but then incorrectly copies parts of the input (like the pixels below the line in Example 1's transformed output) or fails to place the falling pixels correctly relative to the azure line.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Azure Line Identification:** Implement a more robust method to find the *lowest* row containing a horizontal segment predominantly of azure pixels. Iterate from the bottom row upwards. Allow for white (0) pixels within the line segment.
2.  **Simplify Falling Logic:** Instead of collecting all pixels above, iterate through the row *directly above* the identified azure line in the input grid. For each column, if there is a non-white, non-azure pixel in this row, copy it to the same column in the row directly above the azure line in the *output* grid.
3.  **Implement Pixel Removal:** Ensure the output grid is initialized to white (0). Copy *only* the identified azure line from the input to the output. Then, place the "fallen" pixels as described in step 2. All other pixels (originally below the line, or further above the line) remain white in the output.
4.  **Validate with Examples:** Re-test the refined logic against all training examples.
