"""
Identifies a primary azure (8) structure, determines its bounding box and orientation (horizontal/vertical).
Creates an output grid initialized to white (0).
Copies the azure structure to the output grid.
Projects other colored pixels (non-white, non-azure) from the input grid onto the row/column adjacent to the azure structure in the output grid, based on the structure's orientation.
- For a horizontal azure structure, pixels above are projected onto the row directly above the structure's top edge, and pixels below are projected onto the row directly below the structure's bottom edge.
- For a vertical azure structure, pixels to the left (within the structure's row span) are projected onto the column directly left of the structure's left edge, and pixels to the right (within the structure's row span) are projected onto the column directly right of the structure's right edge.
Overlapping projections overwrite previous values.

## General Assessment

The previous code correctly solved Examples 1 and 2 but failed on Example 3. The core logic involved identifying an azure (8) structure, determining its orientation (horizontal/vertical), and projecting non-white/non-azure pixels from the input onto the row/column adjacent to the azure structure's bounding box in the output.

The failure in Example 3 revealed a flaw: the code projected pixels based on the *entire span* of the azure structure's bounding box, regardless of whether an azure pixel was actually present at the specific column (for horizontal) or row (for vertical) corresponding to the projection target. The expected output for Example 3 shows projections only occurring adjacent to actual azure pixels along the structure's edge.

The strategy is to refine the projection logic: a pixel should only be projected onto an adjacent row/column if the cell on the edge of the azure bounding box, corresponding to that projection target, is itself an azure pixel.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the structure properties and the projection differences in Example 3.
