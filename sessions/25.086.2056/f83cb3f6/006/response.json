            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly solved Examples 1 and 2 but failed on Example 3. The core logic involved identifying an azure (8) structure, determining its orientation (horizontal/vertical), and projecting non-white/non-azure pixels from the input onto the row/column adjacent to the azure structure's bounding box in the output.\n\nThe failure in Example 3 revealed a flaw: the code projected pixels based on the *entire span* of the azure structure's bounding box, regardless of whether an azure pixel was actually present at the specific column (for horizontal) or row (for vertical) corresponding to the projection target. The expected output for Example 3 shows projections only occurring adjacent to actual azure pixels along the structure's edge.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the projection logic: a pixel should only be projected onto an adjacent row/column if the cell on the edge of the azure bounding box, corresponding to that projection target, is itself an azure pixel.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the structure properties and the projection differences in Example 3.\n"
