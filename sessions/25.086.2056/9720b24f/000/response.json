            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task.\n\n## Perception\n\nThe task involves modifying input grids based on local interactions between pixels of different colors. Across the examples, certain pixels change their color to white (0), while others remain unchanged. The change seems dependent on the pixel's own color and the color(s) of its immediate neighbors (including diagonals).\n\nBy comparing the input and output grids in each example, I observed the following specific interactions leading to a pixel being changed to white (0):\n\n1.  An Orange (7) pixel is changed if it has a Blue (1) neighbor. (Example 1)\n2.  A Gray (5) pixel is changed if it has a Red (2) neighbor. (Examples 2, 4)\n3.  An Azure (8) pixel is changed if it has a Magenta (6) neighbor. (Example 2)\n4.  A Magenta (6) pixel is changed if it has a Green (3) neighbor. (Example 3)\n5.  An Azure (8) pixel is changed if it has an Orange (7) neighbor. (Example 3)\n\nPixels that do not meet these specific neighbor conditions, or pixels that are white (0) initially, retain their original color in the output grid. The transformation is applied pixel by pixel based on these local adjacency rules.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Iterate through each pixel `P` at position `(row, column)` in the input grid.\n3.  Get the color of pixel `P`, let's call it `C_current`.\n4.  If `C_current` is white (0), proceed to the next pixel without changing the output grid.\n5.  If `C_current` is not white (0), examine the colors of all 8 neighbors of pixel `P` in the input grid.\n6.  Initialize a flag `remove_pixel` to `false`.\n7.  For each neighbor `N` with color `C_neighbor`:\n    *   Check if the pair (`C_neighbor`, `C_current`) matches any of the following conditions:\n        *   (`C_neighbor` is Blue (1) AND `C_current` is Orange (7))\n        *   (`C_neighbor` is Red (2) AND `C_current` is Gray (5))\n        *   (`C_neighbor` is Green (3) AND `C_current` is Magenta (6))\n        *   (`C_neighbor` is Magenta (6) AND `C_current` is Azure (8))\n        *   (`C_neighbor` is Orange (7) AND `C_current` is Azure (8))\n    *   If any of these conditions are true, set `remove_pixel` to `true` and stop checking further neighbors for this pixel `P`.\n8.  After checking all neighbors, if `remove_pixel` is `true`, update the color of the pixel at `(row, column)` in the output grid to white (0).\n9.  Once all pixels in the input grid have been processed, the final output grid is complete."
