elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels, each represented by an integer color code (0-9).
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0 to 9.
      - position: Coordinates (row, column) within the grid.
      - neighbors: The set of 8 pixels directly or diagonally adjacent.
actions:
  - name: change_color
    target: pixel
    result: The pixel's color is changed to white (0).
conditions_for_action:
  - description: >
      A pixel P with color C_P has its color changed to white (0) if
      it is adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one neighbor pixel N
      with color C_N, AND the pair (C_N, C_P) matches one of the specific
      triggering pairs.
triggering_pairs: # (Neighbor Color C_N, Pixel Color C_P) that causes C_P to become white (0)
