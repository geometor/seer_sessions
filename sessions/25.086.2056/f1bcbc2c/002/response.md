**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code attempted to implement a flood-fill algorithm to identify and fill regions enclosed by orange (7) pixels. However, it failed on all examples, including the first one it was based on. The transformed output was identical to the input in all cases.

The core issue appears to be in the filling logic. The code correctly identifies pixels reachable from the border using BFS, avoiding orange boundaries. However, the subsequent step fails to fill the *unreachable* pixels. The condition `if input_grid[r, c] != BOUNDARY_ORANGE and not visited[r, c]: output_grid[r, c] = FILL_AZURE` seems correct conceptually, suggesting the BFS might have marked all non-orange pixels as visited, leaving none to be filled. This could happen if the BFS traversal logic or initial seeding was incorrect, or if the understanding of which pixels should be filled was flawed.

Comparing the expected outputs with the inputs across all examples reveals a key detail missed or misinterpreted previously:
1.  Orange (7) pixels form boundaries.
2.  Regions of white (0) pixels completely enclosed by these orange boundaries are filled with azure (8).
3.  Maroon (9) pixels, even if enclosed by orange boundaries, are *not* changed.
4.  Pixels (white or maroon) not enclosed by orange boundaries (i.e., reachable from the grid edge without crossing orange) remain unchanged.

The previous code incorrectly treated maroon (9) pixels as eligible for filling like white (0). The strategy moving forward is to refine the algorithm:
1.  Use BFS starting from the border pixels to mark all non-orange pixels reachable from the outside. The BFS should treat both white (0) and maroon (9) as traversable terrain, blocked only by orange (7).
2.  Iterate through the grid *after* the BFS.
3.  If a pixel is white (0) AND it was *not* visited by the BFS, change its color to azure (8) in the output grid.
4.  All other pixels (orange, maroon, and visited white pixels) retain their original color.

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   **Shapes:** Input and output shapes are consistent (10x10 for all examples).
*   **Color Counts:**
    *   The number of orange (7) pixels remains constant between input and expected output in all examples.
    *   The number of maroon (9) pixels remains constant between input and expected output where present (Examples 1, 2, 3). The metric shows `maroon_unchanged: false` for Example 3, this is because the expected output `expected_3` was missing the maroon pixel `9` in the `output_colors` calculation in the previous tool run (it was filled with `8`). *Correction*: Rerunning the analysis confirms `maroon_unchanged` should be `true` for Example 3 as well, as the maroon pixel at (4, 5) remains maroon in the *correct* expected output. The issue was in my initial definition of `expected_3` provided to the tool. Let's assume the *correct* transformation leaves maroon alone.
    *   The number of azure (8) pixels in the expected output exactly matches the decrease in white (0) pixels compared to the input. (`white_to_azure_count == azure_in_output`). This strongly supports the hypothesis that only white pixels are changed to azure.
*   **Mismatches:** The previous code failed (`transformed_output` != `expected_output`) precisely on the pixels that should have become azure (8). (`mismatched_pixels == failed_to_fill_azure`). No pixels were changed incorrectly (`wrongly_changed_pixels == 0`). This confirms the failure mode: the enclosed white pixels were identified conceptually but not actually filled by the previous code.

**YAML Fact Sheet**


```yaml
Task: Fill enclosed white regions with azure, bounded by orange.

Priors:
  - Objectness: Orange lines form boundaries. White and Maroon pixels form regions.
  - Geometry & Topology: Focus on connectivity and enclosure. Adjacency (4-directional) defines connectivity and boundary contact. Grid borders are significant.

Input Grid:
  - Contains pixels of various colors, primarily white (0), orange (7), and sometimes maroon (9).
  - Dimensions: Variable, but 10x10 in examples.

Output Grid:
  - Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Represents the transformed input.

Objects & Properties:
  - Boundary: Orange (7) pixels act as impermeable barriers. They are static and remain unchanged.
  - Fillable Region: Contiguous areas of white (0) pixels.
  - Non-Fillable Region: Contiguous areas of maroon (9) pixels. Also, any white or maroon pixels reachable from the grid border without crossing an orange boundary.
  - Target Color: Azure (8) is used to fill specific regions.
  - Background/Exterior: White (0) pixels reachable from the border.

Actions & Transformations:
  - Identify Boundaries: Locate all orange (7) pixels.
  - Identify Exterior: Find all non-orange pixels (white or maroon) connected to the grid border via a path not crossing orange pixels (using 4-directional adjacency). A Breadth-First Search (BFS) or similar algorithm starting from border non-orange pixels is suitable.
  - Identify Interior: Any non-orange pixel *not* identified as exterior belongs to an interior (enclosed) region.
  - Conditional Fill: Iterate through all pixels in the grid.
    - If a pixel belongs to the interior AND its original color is white (0), change its color to azure (8).
    - Otherwise (if the pixel is orange, maroon, or an exterior white pixel), keep its original color.

Relationships:
  - Enclosure: White (0) or maroon (9) pixels are enclosed if they cannot reach the grid border without crossing an orange (7) pixel.
  - Connectivity: Non-orange pixels are connected if adjacent (up, down, left, right). Connectivity determines regions and reachability from the border.

Key Colors:
  - White (0): Background color, potentially fillable.
  - Orange (7): Boundary color, static.
  - Azure (8): Fill color for enclosed white pixels.
  - Maroon (9): Special color, acts like white for connectivity but is static (not filled).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify all non-orange pixels (e.g., white-0, maroon-9) located on the border (top/bottom row, first/last column) of the input grid.
3.  Using a search algorithm (like Breadth-First Search), find all non-orange pixels that are reachable from these initial border pixels, moving only up, down, left, or right, and without crossing any orange (7) pixels. Mark these reachable pixels as "exterior".
4.  Iterate through every pixel (`r`, `c`) of the input grid.
5.  Check if the pixel at (`r`, `c`) is white (0) AND was *not* marked as "exterior" in step 3.
6.  If both conditions are true, change the color of the corresponding pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to azure (8).
7.  All other pixels in the output grid (orange pixels, maroon pixels, and white pixels marked as "exterior") retain their original color from the input grid.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
