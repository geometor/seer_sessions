Task: Fill enclosed white regions with azure, bounded by orange.

Priors:
  - Objectness: Orange lines form boundaries. White and Maroon pixels form regions.
  - Geometry & Topology: Focus on connectivity and enclosure. Adjacency (4-directional) defines connectivity and boundary contact. Grid borders are significant.

Input Grid:
  - Contains pixels of various colors, primarily white (0), orange (7), and sometimes maroon (9).
  - Dimensions: Variable, but 10x10 in examples.

Output Grid:
  - Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Represents the transformed input.

Objects & Properties:
  - Boundary: Orange (7) pixels act as impermeable barriers. They are static and remain unchanged.
  - Fillable Region: Contiguous areas of white (0) pixels.
  - Non-Fillable Region: Contiguous areas of maroon (9) pixels. Also, any white or maroon pixels reachable from the grid border without crossing an orange boundary.
  - Target Color: Azure (8) is used to fill specific regions.
  - Background/Exterior: White (0) pixels reachable from the border.

Actions & Transformations:
  - Identify Boundaries: Locate all orange (7) pixels.
  - Identify Exterior: Find all non-orange pixels (white or maroon) connected to the grid border via a path not crossing orange pixels (using 4-directional adjacency). A Breadth-First Search (BFS) or similar algorithm starting from border non-orange pixels is suitable.
  - Identify Interior: Any non-orange pixel *not* identified as exterior belongs to an interior (enclosed) region.
  - Conditional Fill: Iterate through all pixels in the grid.
    - If a pixel belongs to the interior AND its original color is white (0), change its color to azure (8).
    - Otherwise (if the pixel is orange, maroon, or an exterior white pixel), keep its original color.

Relationships:
  - Enclosure: White (0) or maroon (9) pixels are enclosed if they cannot reach the grid border without crossing an orange (7) pixel.
  - Connectivity: Non-orange pixels are connected if adjacent (up, down, left, right). Connectivity determines regions and reachability from the border.

Key Colors:
  - White (0): Background color, potentially fillable.
  - Orange (7): Boundary color, static.
  - Azure (8): Fill color for enclosed white pixels.
  - Maroon (9): Special color, acts like white for connectivity but is static (not filled).
