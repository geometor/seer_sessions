Some inputs contain a single maroon (9) pixel.\n    *   The orange pixels form connected shapes that act as boundaries or walls.\n    *   The output grids are identical to the input grids, except that some white (0) pixels are replaced with azure (8) pixels.\n    *   In examples train\\_1 and train\\_3, the maroon (9) pixel is also replaced with azure (8). In train\\_2, the maroon pixel remains unchanged.\n    *   The azure (8) pixels appear in regions enclosed by the orange (7) boundaries.\n    *   The transformation seems to involve identifying areas completely surrounded by orange pixels and filling these areas with azure pixels.\n    *   Pixels that are not orange and are not enclosed by orange pixels remain unchanged.\n    *   The maroon pixel (9) is treated like a white pixel (0) for the purpose of filling: if it's inside an enclosed region, it becomes azure (8); otherwise (like in train\\_2, where it touches the 'outside'), it remains unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts YAML:**\n    "

Identify all regions of connected pixels that are *not* orange.\n    3.  Determine which of these non-orange regions are completely enclosed by the orange boundaries (meaning they do not touch any edge of the grid). This can be done using a flood fill algorithm starting from all non-orange pixels on the grid's border; any non-orange pixel not reached by this flood fill is considered enclosed.\n    4.  For every pixel identified as being within an enclosed region, change its color to azure (8) in the output grid.\n    5.
