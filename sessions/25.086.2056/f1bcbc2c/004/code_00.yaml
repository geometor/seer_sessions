    - 7: orange (boundary/wall)

    fillable_colors: [white (0), maroon (9)]
    fill_color: azure (8)
  rule:
    For each row:
      Initialize state as "outside".
      Iterate through cells left-to-right:
        If cell is orange (7):
          Toggle state between "inside" and "outside".
          Keep cell color orange (7).
        Else if cell is white (0) or maroon (9):
          If state is "inside":
            Change cell color to azure (8).
          Else (state is "outside"):
            Keep original cell color (0 or 9).
        Else (other colors, though none expected based on examples):
          Keep original cell color.
