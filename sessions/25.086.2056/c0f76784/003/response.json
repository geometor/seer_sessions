Identify contiguous white (0) regions completely enclosed by a border of only gray (5) pixels (using 8-connectivity for border definition). Fill these enclosed white regions with a specific color based on their area:\n    - Area 1: Fill with magenta (6)\n    - Area 4: Fill with orange (7)\n    - Area 6: Fill with orange (7)\n    - Area 9: Fill with azure (8)\n    Keep track of the gray border pixels associated with these filled regions.\n\n2.  Identify gray (5) pixels in the original input grid that meet two conditions:\n    a. They do not have any adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (0) neighbors in the input grid.\n    b.
