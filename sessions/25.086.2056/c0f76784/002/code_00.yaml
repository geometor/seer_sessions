task_description: Apply two rules sequentially. First, fill certain white regions enclosed by gray borders based on area. Second, change specific gray pixels to magenta unless they border a filled region or a white pixel.

definitions:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array of integers 0-9
    properties:
      - height: integer
      - width: integer
  - object: region
    type: contiguous set of pixels of the same color
    properties:
      - pixels: list of (row, col) tuples
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - area: integer (count of pixels)
  - object: border
    type: set of pixels adjacent (8-connectivity) to a region but not part of it
    properties:
      - pixels: list of (row, col) tuples
      - color: integer (must be uniformly gray (5) for rule 1)
  - object: hollow_rectangle_region
    type: region
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - border: must consist entirely of gray (5) pixels
      - area: integer (1, 4, 6, or 9 for rule 1)
  - object: isolated_gray_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - condition: has no adjacent (4-connectivity) white (0) neighbors in the input grid
      - condition: is not part of the gray border of a hollow_rectangle_region that gets filled by rule 1

rule_1_area_color_map:
  1: magenta (6)
  4: orange (7)
  6: orange (7) # Note: Area 6 also maps to orange
  9: azure (8)

actions:
  - action: identify_hollow_rectangles
    input: input_grid
    output: list of hollow_rectangle_regions and their gray borders
    constraints: Only considers white regions completely enclosed by gray pixels. Only regions with areas 1, 4, 6, or 9 are relevant.
  - action: fill_regions
    input: output_grid (initially copy of input), hollow_rectangle_regions
    effect: Changes the color of pixels within the identified hollow_rectangle_regions in the output_grid according to rule_1_area_color_map.
  - action: identify_isolated_grays
    input: input_grid, borders_of_filled_regions
    output: list of isolated_gray_pixels
    constraints: Checks gray pixels in the input grid. Excludes gray pixels with white neighbors (4-connectivity). Excludes gray pixels that are part of the borders identified in identify_hollow_rectangles for filled regions.
  - action: change_isolated_grays
    input: output_grid, isolated_gray_pixels
    effect: Changes the color of identified isolated_gray_pixels to magenta (6) in the output_grid.
