definitions:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array of integers 0-9 (colors)
  - object: pixel
    type: element in the grid
    properties:
      - location: (row, column) tuple
      - color: integer (0-9)
  - object: region
    type: connected (4-connectivity) set of pixels of the same color
    properties:
      - pixels: set of (row, column) tuples
      - color: integer
      - area: integer (number of pixels in the region)
  - object: border
    type: set of pixels adjacent (8-connectivity) to a region but not part of it
    properties:
      - pixels: set of (row, column) tuples
  - object: fillable_white_region
    type: region
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - border: must consist entirely of gray (5) pixels
      - area: must be 1, 4, 6, or 9
  - object: target_gray_pixel_rule2
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - input_color: gray (5)
      - condition_1: has no white (0) neighbors (4-connectivity) in the input grid
      - condition_2: is not part of the gray (5) border of any fillable_white_region processed in Rule 1

rule_1_mapping:
  description: Maps the area of a fillable_white_region to a fill color.
  map:
    1: magenta (6)
    4: orange (7)
    6: orange (7)
    9: azure (8)

rule_2_change:
  description: Defines the color change for target_gray_pixel_rule2.
  target_color: magenta (6)

actions:
  - name: process_rule_1
    description: Identifies fillable_white_regions, applies rule_1_mapping to fill them in the output grid, and collects the gray border pixels of these filled regions.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - partially_modified_output_grid
      - set_of_filled_region_border_pixels (all gray)
  - name: process_rule_2
    description: Identifies target_gray_pixel_rule2 based on input_grid and the set_of_filled_region_border_pixels, then changes their color in the output grid according to rule_2_change.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - partially_modified_output_grid
      - set_of_filled_region_border_pixels
    outputs:
