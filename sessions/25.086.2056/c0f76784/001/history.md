Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grids:** The input grids consist of a white (0) background and several objects made of gray (5) pixels. These gray objects appear to be primarily hollow rectangles of varying sizes and positions. In one example (train_1), there's also a more complex L-shaped gray structure.
2.  **Output Grids:** The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, but the areas *inside* the hollow gray rectangles are filled with different colors (magenta-6, orange-7, azure-8). Additionally, in train_1, a single gray pixel within the complex L-shape structure changes to magenta (6).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying hollow gray rectangles and filling their interiors. The fill color seems dependent on the size (specifically, the area) of the enclosed white region. A secondary transformation appears to target specific gray pixels based on their local neighborhood.
4.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   White interiors of area 1 (from 3x3 rectangles) are filled with magenta (6).
    *   White interiors of area 4 (from 4x4 rectangles) are filled with orange (7).
    *   White interiors of area 6 (from 4x5 rectangles) are filled with orange (7).
    *   White interiors of area 9 (from 5x5 rectangles) are filled with azure (8).
    *   A single gray pixel, not part of a hollow rectangle's immediate border and not adjacent (4-directionally) to any white pixel, changes to magenta (6) (seen in train_1).

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Fill hollow gray rectangles and modify specific internal gray pixels.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Primary_Object_Color: gray (5).
  - Objects:
    - Type_1: Hollow Rectangles
      - Properties:
        - Border: Composed of gray (5) pixels.
        - Interior: Contiguous region of white (0) pixels.
        - Shape: Rectangular border.
        - Size: Variable height and width.
    - Type_2: Other Gray Structures (e.g., L-shapes, potentially solid)
      - Properties:
        - Composition: Composed of gray (5) pixels.
        - Shape: Non-rectangular or filled.
    - Type_3: Individual Gray Pixels
      - Properties:
        - Color: gray (5)
        - Location: Relative to other pixels.
        - Neighborhood: Surrounding pixel colors.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Modified version of the input grid.
  - Changes:
    - Fill_Interior: White (0) interiors of Type_1 objects are filled.
      - Fill_Color: Depends on the Area of the white interior region.
        - Area 1: magenta (6)
        - Area 4: orange (7)
        - Area 6: orange (7)
        - Area 9: azure (8)
    - Modify_Pixel: Specific Type_3 gray pixels change color.
      - Target_Pixel: Gray (5) pixels with no white (0) neighbors in the 4 cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).
      - New_Color: magenta (6)

Relationships:
  - Containment: Hollow gray rectangles contain white interior regions.
  - Adjacency: Used to define borders, interiors, and pixel neighborhoods.
  - Surroundedness:
    - White interiors are surrounded by gray borders.
    - Specific gray pixels are surrounded by non-white pixels.

Actions:
  - Identify_Objects: Locate hollow gray rectangles and their white interiors.
  - Calculate_Area: Determine the number of pixels in each identified white interior.
  - Map_Area_To_Color: Assign a fill color based on the calculated area.
  - Fill_Region: Change the color of pixels within the white interior.
  - Identify_Target_Pixels: Locate gray pixels meeting the neighborhood criteria.
  - Modify_Pixel_Color: Change the color of identified target gray pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each white region found:
    a.  Determine its boundary pixels (white pixels adjacent to non-white pixels).
    b.  Check if *all* pixels adjacent (8-directionally) to the boundary pixels, which are *outside* the white region itself, are gray (5).
    c.  If the condition in (3b) is true (the white region is perfectly enclosed by gray), calculate the area (number of pixels) of this white region.
    d.  Based on the calculated area, select a fill color:
        *   If Area = 1, fill color is magenta (6).
        *   If Area = 4, fill color is orange (7).
        *   If Area = 6, fill color is orange (7).
        *   If Area = 9, fill color is azure (8).
        *   (Assume other areas do not occur or result in no change).
    e.  In the output grid, change the color of all pixels belonging to this white region to the selected fill color.
4.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the *input* grid.
5.  If the pixel `(r, c)` in the *input* grid is gray (5):
    a.  Check its 4 cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) within the bounds of the *input* grid.
    b.  Count how many of these neighbors are white (0).
    c.  If the count of white neighbors is exactly zero, change the color of the pixel `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to magenta (6).
6.  Return the final output grid.
