Task: Fill hollow gray rectangles and modify specific internal gray pixels.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Primary_Object_Color: gray (5).
  - Objects:
    - Type_1: Hollow Rectangles
      - Properties:
        - Border: Composed of gray (5) pixels.
        - Interior: Contiguous region of white (0) pixels.
        - Shape: Rectangular border.
        - Size: Variable height and width.
    - Type_2: Other Gray Structures (e.g., L-shapes, potentially solid)
      - Properties:
        - Composition: Composed of gray (5) pixels.
        - Shape: Non-rectangular or filled.
    - Type_3: Individual Gray Pixels
      - Properties:
        - Color: gray (5)
        - Location: Relative to other pixels.
        - Neighborhood: Surrounding pixel colors.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Modified version of the input grid.
  - Changes:
    - Fill_Interior: White (0) interiors of Type_1 objects are filled.
      - Fill_Color: Depends on the Area of the white interior region.
        - Area 1: magenta (6)
        - Area 4: orange (7)
        - Area 6: orange (7)
        - Area 9: azure (8)
    - Modify_Pixel: Specific Type_3 gray pixels change color.
      - Target_Pixel: Gray (5) pixels with no white (0) neighbors in the 4 cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).
      - New_Color: magenta (6)

Relationships:
  - Containment: Hollow gray rectangles contain white interior regions.
  - Adjacency: Used to define borders, interiors, and pixel neighborhoods.
  - Surroundedness:
    - White interiors are surrounded by gray borders.
    - Specific gray pixels are surrounded by non-white pixels.

Actions:
  - Identify_Objects: Locate hollow gray rectangles and their white interiors.
  - Calculate_Area: Determine the number of pixels in each identified white interior.
  - Map_Area_To_Color: Assign a fill color based on the calculated area.
  - Fill_Region: Change the color of pixels within the white interior.
  - Identify_Target_Pixels: Locate gray pixels meeting the neighborhood criteria.
  - Modify_Pixel_Color: Change the color of identified target gray pixels.
