            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grids:** The input grids consist of a white (0) background and several objects made of gray (5) pixels. These gray objects appear to be primarily hollow rectangles of varying sizes and positions. In one example (train_1), there's also a more complex L-shaped gray structure.\n2.  **Output Grids:** The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, but the areas *inside* the hollow gray rectangles are filled with different colors (magenta-6, orange-7, azure-8). Additionally, in train_1, a single gray pixel within the complex L-shape structure changes to magenta (6).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying hollow gray rectangles and filling their interiors. The fill color seems dependent on the size (specifically, the area) of the enclosed white region. A secondary transformation appears to target specific gray pixels based on their local neighborhood.\n4.  **Color Mapping:**\n    *   White interiors of area 1 (from 3x3 rectangles) are filled with magenta (6).\n    *   White interiors of area 4 (from 4x4 rectangles) are filled with orange (7).\n    *   White interiors of area 6 (from 4x5 rectangles) are filled with orange (7).\n    *   White interiors of area 9 (from 5x5 rectangles) are filled with azure (8).\n    *   A single gray pixel, not part of a hollow rectangle's immediate border and not adjacent (4-directionally) to any white pixel, changes to magenta (6) (seen in train_1).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
