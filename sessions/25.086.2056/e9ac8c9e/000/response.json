The output grid retains the dimensions of the input but replaces the gray rectangle's area with a pattern derived from the four corner pixels. Specifically, the area previously occupied by the gray rectangle is divided into four equal quadrants, and each quadrant is filled with the color of the corresponding nearby corner pixel. All original non-white pixels (the gray rectangle and the four corner pixels) are effectively removed or replaced, leaving only the newly colored quadrants on a white background.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the largest contiguous rectangular object composed of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. Record its bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column) and its dimensions (height H', width W').\n3.  Find the four single-pixel objects in the input grid that are not white (0) and not gray (5).\n4.  Assign each of these four pixels to a corner relative to the gray rectangle's bounding box:\n    *   The pixel with row < minimum row and column < minimum column is the Top-Left (TL) corner pixel.\n    *   The pixel with row < minimum row and column > maximum column is the Top-Right (TR) corner pixel.\n    *   The pixel with row > maximum row and column < minimum column is the Bottom-Left (BL) corner pixel.\n    *   The pixel with row > maximum row and column > maximum column is the Bottom-Right (BR) corner pixel.\n    *   Record the color of each corner pixel.\n5.  Calculate the midpoint row and column for dividing the gray rectangle's area: `mid_row = min_row + H'/2`, `mid_col = min_col + W'/2`.\n6.  Fill the pixels in the output grid within the gray rectangle's original bounding box according to the following quadrant rules:\n    *   For rows `r` from `min_row` to `mid_row - 1` and columns `c` from `min_col` to `mid_col - 1`, set the pixel `(r, c)` to the color of the TL corner pixel.\n    *   For rows `r` from `min_row` to `mid_row - 1` and columns `c` from `mid_col` to `max_col`, set the pixel `(r, c)` to the color of the TR corner pixel.\n    *   For rows `r` from `mid_row` to `max_row` and columns `c` from `min_col` to `mid_col - 1`, set the pixel `(r, c)` to the color of the BL corner pixel.\n    *   For rows `r` from `mid_row` to `max_row` and columns `c` from `mid_col` to `max_col`, set the pixel `(r, c)` to the color of the BR corner pixel.\n7.  Return the modified output grid."
