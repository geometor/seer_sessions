task_elements:
  - item: input_grid
    attributes:
      - contains a background color (white, 0)
      - contains a single connected object composed of non-white pixels
  - item: non_white_object
    attributes:
      - composed of one or more non-white colors
      - located somewhere within the input grid
      - forms a contiguous shape
  - item: output_grid
    attributes:
      - represents the extracted non_white_object
      - dimensions are determined by the bounding box of the non_white_object
      - contains only the pixels from the non_white_object in their original relative arrangement
actions:
  - action: identify_pixels
    actor: system
    target: input_grid
    condition: pixel color is not white (0)
    result: set of non-white pixel coordinates
  - action: calculate_bounding_box
    actor: system
    target: set of non-white pixel coordinates
    computation: find minimum and maximum row and column indices
    result: coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the bounding box
  - action: extract_subgrid
    actor: system
    target: input_grid
    using: bounding box coordinates
    result: output_grid
