This block forms an \"object\".\n3.  **Object Composition:** The object itself may contain pixels of different non-white colors. It appears to be a primary \"outer\" color forming the main shape, with other colors potentially appearing inside.\n4.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid and contains only the non-white pixels observed in the input. The background white pixels are removed.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves isolating the non-white object from the input grid and cropping the grid to the smallest possible rectangle (bounding box) that contains this object. The relative positions of the pixels within the object are preserved.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
