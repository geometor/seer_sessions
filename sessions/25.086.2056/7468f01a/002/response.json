            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis, based on the first example, was that the transformation involved extracting the minimal bounding box containing all non-white pixels. However, testing this hypothesis against the other examples revealed that while the bounding box extraction is part of the process, it is not the complete transformation. The comparison between the `Transformed Output` (simple extraction) and the `Expected Output` shows differences within the extracted region. Specifically, the pixel arrangement within the bounding box is altered.\n\nAnalysis across all three examples strongly suggests that after extracting the subgrid defined by the bounding box of non-white pixels, the extracted subgrid is then flipped horizontally (reflected across its vertical axis). This revised hypothesis consistently explains the relationship between the input and expected output for all provided training examples.\n\nThe previous code successfully implemented the bounding box identification and extraction but failed because it omitted the crucial horizontal flip step. The strategy for resolving the errors is to modify the code to include this horizontal flip operation on the extracted subgrid before returning it as the final output.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
