            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code failed on all examples due to a simple `NameError: name 'j' is not defined` within the dictionary comprehension used to create `col_map`. The variable intended for the value was `i` (the index from `enumerate`), not `j`.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct the Typo:** Fix the error in the `col_map` creation: `col_map = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(unique_cols)}`.\n2.  **Validate Logic:** With the typo corrected, the core logic identified previously (finding non-border 2x2 squares and mapping them to a smaller grid based on relative coordinate order) should be re-evaluated against all training examples.\n3.  **Refine Understanding:** Analyze if the assumption of a minimum 2x2 output grid and the handling of the \"no squares found\" case are correct based on all examples.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect a comprehensive understanding derived from all examples, incorporating the fix and any necessary logical adjustments.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nAlthough I cannot execute code here to get precise metrics from the actual dataset, the analysis suggests the following conceptual metrics would be relevant for each example:\n\n*   Input Grid Dimensions (Height x Width)\n*   Output Grid Dimensions (Height x Width)\n*   Border Color\n*   List of found 2x2 squares: `[(color, row, col), ...]`\n*   Number of found 2x2 squares\n*   Unique Row Coordinates of found squares (sorted)\n*   Unique Column Coordinates of found squares (sorted)\n*   Relationship between unique coordinates counts and output dimensions (e.g., `output_height = max(2, len(unique_rows))`)\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Record the `color`, `row (r)`, and `column (c)` of the top-left corner for each such valid square found. Store these as a list of `(color, r, c)` tuples.\n4.  **Handle Empty Case:** If no valid squares were found in the previous step, construct and return a 2x2 grid filled entirely with the `border_color`.\n5.  **Determine Output Size and Mappings:**\n    *   Collect the unique row coordinates (`r`) from the list of found squares. Sort them to get `unique_rows`.\n    *   Collect the unique column coordinates (`c`) from the list of found squares. Sort them to get `unique_cols`.\n    *   Calculate the output grid dimensions: `output_height = max(2, length of unique_rows)`, `output_width = max(2, length of unique_cols)`.\n    *   Create a `row_map`: map each value in `unique_rows` to its index (0, 1, ...).\n    *   Create a `col_map`: map each value in `unique_cols` to its index (0, 1, ...).\n6.  **Construct Output Grid:**\n    *   Create a new grid with dimensions `output_height` x `output_width`.\n    *   Fill this new grid entirely with the `border_color`.\n    *   Iterate through the recorded list of valid squares `(color, r, c)`:\n        *   Find the target output row index using `output_r = row_map[r]`.\n        *   Find the target output column index using `output_c = col_map[c]`.\n        *   Set the pixel at `[output_r, output_c]` in the new grid to the square's `color`.\n7.  **Return Result:** Return the newly constructed output grid."
