## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code failed on all examples due to a simple `NameError: name 'j' is not defined` within the dictionary comprehension used to create `col_map`. The variable intended for the value was `i` (the index from `enumerate`), not `j`.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct the Typo:** Fix the error in the `col_map` creation: `col_map = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(unique_cols)}`.
2.  **Validate Logic:** With the typo corrected, the core logic identified previously (finding non-border 2x2 squares and mapping them to a smaller grid based on relative coordinate order) should be re-evaluated against all training examples.
3.  **Refine Understanding:** Analyze if the assumption of a minimum 2x2 output grid and the handling of the "no squares found" case are correct based on all examples.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect a comprehensive understanding derived from all examples, incorporating the fix and any necessary logical adjustments.

## Metrics Gathering

Although I cannot execute code here to get precise metrics from the actual dataset, the analysis suggests the following conceptual metrics would be relevant for each example:

*   Input Grid Dimensions (Height x Width)
*   Output Grid Dimensions (Height x Width)
*   Border Color
*   List of found 2x2 squares: `[(color, row, col), ...]`
*   Number of found 2x2 squares
*   Unique Row Coordinates of found squares (sorted)
*   Unique Column Coordinates of found squares (sorted)
*   Relationship between unique coordinates counts and output dimensions (e.g., `output_height = max(2, len(unique_rows))`)

## YAML Facts


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    description: A 2D grid of pixels representing the input state.
    properties:
      - dimensions: Variable height and width (within 1x1 to 30x30).
      - pixels: Each pixel has a color value (0-9).
      - border: Contains a border, typically 1 pixel thick and of a uniform color. The border color can be identified from edge pixels (e.g., top-left).
      - content: May contain solid 2x2 squares of a single color, distinct from the border color.
  - object: uniform_2x2_square
    description: A 2x2 block of pixels within the input grid, all having the same color.
    properties:
      - color: The single color filling the 2x2 square. This color must not be the same as the input grid's border color.
      - location: Defined by the row and column index of its top-left pixel within the input grid.
  - object: output_grid
    description: A 2D grid of pixels representing the transformed state, summarizing the detected squares.
    properties:
      - dimensions: Determined by the spatial distribution of the detected uniform_2x2_squares.
          height: Equals the count of unique row coordinates of the detected squares, with a minimum value of 2.
          width: Equals the count of unique column coordinates of the detected squares, with a minimum value of 2.
      - background_color: Initialized with the border color identified from the input grid.
      - content: Pixels corresponding to the relative positions of detected squares are set to the color of those squares.
  - action: identify_border_color
    description: Determine the border color of the input grid.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - border_color: The color value of the border pixels.
    assumptions:
      - Border is 1 pixel thick.
      - Border color is uniform.
      - Top-left pixel (0,0) represents the border color.
  - action: find_qualifying_squares
    description: Scan the input grid to locate all uniform_2x2_squares whose color is not the border_color.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - border_color
    outputs:
      - found_squares: A list of tuples, each containing (color, row, col) for a qualifying square's top-left corner.
  - action: map_coordinates_and_build_output
    description: Create the output grid by mapping the found squares based on their relative positions.
    inputs:
      - found_squares
      - border_color
    outputs:
      - output_grid
    process:
      - If no squares were found (`found_squares` is empty):
          - Create a 2x2 grid filled with `border_color`.
          - Return this grid.
      - Extract unique row coordinates (`unique_rows`) and unique column coordinates (`unique_cols`) from `found_squares`. Sort both lists.
      - Determine output grid dimensions: `out_h = max(2, len(unique_rows))`, `out_w = max(2, len(unique_cols))`.
      - Create index mappings: `row_map = {row_val: index for index, row_val in enumerate(unique_rows)}`, `col_map = {col_val: index for index, col_val in enumerate(unique_cols)}`.
      - Initialize the `output_grid` of size `out_h` x `out_w` with `border_color`.
      - For each `(color, r, c)` in `found_squares`:
          - Determine output coordinates: `out_r = row_map[r]`, `out_c = col_map[c]`.
          - Set `output_grid[out_r, out_c] = color`.
      - Return the final `output_grid`.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Border Color:** Examine the input grid's edge (e.g., the pixel at `[0, 0]`) to determine the `border_color`.
2.  **Scan for 2x2 Squares:** Iterate through the input grid, checking every possible 2x2 area (defined by its top-left corner at `[r, c]`).
3.  **Filter Squares:** Identify the 2x2 areas where all four pixels have the *same color* and this color is *not* the `border_color`. Record the `color`, `row (r)`, and `column (c)` of the top-left corner for each such valid square found. Store these as a list of `(color, r, c)` tuples.
4.  **Handle Empty Case:** If no valid squares were found in the previous step, construct and return a 2x2 grid filled entirely with the `border_color`.
5.  **Determine Output Size and Mappings:**
    *   Collect the unique row coordinates (`r`) from the list of found squares. Sort them to get `unique_rows`.
    *   Collect the unique column coordinates (`c`) from the list of found squares. Sort them to get `unique_cols`.
    *   Calculate the output grid dimensions: `output_height = max(2, length of unique_rows)`, `output_width = max(2, length of unique_cols)`.
    *   Create a `row_map`: map each value in `unique_rows` to its index (0, 1, ...).
    *   Create a `col_map`: map each value in `unique_cols` to its index (0, 1, ...).
6.  **Construct Output Grid:**
    *   Create a new grid with dimensions `output_height` x `output_width`.
    *   Fill this new grid entirely with the `border_color`.
    *   Iterate through the recorded list of valid squares `(color, r, c)`:
        *   Find the target output row index using `output_r = row_map[r]`.
        *   Find the target output column index using `output_c = col_map[c]`.
        *   Set the pixel at `[output_r, output_c]` in the new grid to the square's `color`.
7.  **Return Result:** Return the newly constructed output grid.
