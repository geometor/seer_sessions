            "text": "*   **Perception**:\n    The task requires identifying specific objects within the input grid and representing their relative spatial arrangement in a smaller output grid. The input grids feature a prominent 1-pixel border of a certain color. Inside this border, there are often internal structures or lines using either the border color or another color. The key elements to identify are 2x2 squares composed of a single, uniform color that is *not* the same as the border color. The output grid captures the colors of these identified 2x2 squares, placing them in positions that reflect their relative row and column locations in the input grid. The dimensions of the output grid are determined by the number of unique rows and columns occupied by the top-left corners of these squares, but with a minimum size of 2x2. Any positions in the output grid that do not correspond to a found 2x2 square are filled with the border color identified from the input grid.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
