task_description: Change specific white pixels to green based on their position relative to boundary pixels (red or gray).

grid_elements:
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Can be white(0), red(2), green(3), gray(8), or others.
      - position: Defined by row and column index (r, c).

boundary_pixels:
  - color: red (2)
  - color: gray (8)
  description: These pixels act as boundaries for the transformation rule.

target_pixels:
  - color: white (0)
  description: These are the only pixels eligible for transformation.

output_pixels:
  - color: green (3)
  description: The color assigned to transformed white pixels.

transformation_rule:
  action: change_color
  input_color: white (0)
  output_color: green (3)
  condition:
    type: parity_check
    operands:
      - count_left: Number of boundary pixels (red or gray) in the same row, strictly to the left of the target pixel.
      - count_above: Number of boundary pixels (red or gray) in the same column, strictly above the target pixel.
    logic: The change occurs if (count_left is odd) OR (count_above is odd).

invariants:
  - Pixels that are not white (0) in the input remain unchanged in the output.
  - White (0) pixels that do not meet the parity check condition remain white (0) in the output.
  - Grid dimensions remain the same.
