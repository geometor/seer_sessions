The grid dimensions vary between examples.\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The main colors are white (0), red (2), green (3), and gray (8).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core change is that some white (0) pixels in the input grid are turned into green (3) pixels in the output grid. All other pixels (red, gray, etc.) retain their original color and position.\n4.  **Identifying the Pattern:** The change from white (0) to green (3) doesn't happen to *all* white pixels. It seems dependent on the pixel's position relative to red (2) and gray (8) pixels.\n5.  **Boundary Colors:** Red (2) and gray (8) pixels appear to function as boundaries or walls within the grid.\n6.  **Parity Check Hypothesis:** The transformation rule seems related to a parity check (odd/even count). For a given white pixel, counting the number of boundary pixels (red or gray) encountered when moving horizontally from the left edge, or vertically from the top edge, determines if the pixel should change color. If the count of boundary pixels to the left is odd, OR the count of boundary pixels above is odd, the white pixel becomes green.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
