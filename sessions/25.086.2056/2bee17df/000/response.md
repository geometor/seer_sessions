Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of pixels with different colors. The grid dimensions vary between examples.
2.  **Colors Involved:** The main colors are white (0), red (2), green (3), and gray (8).
3.  **Transformation:** The core change is that some white (0) pixels in the input grid are turned into green (3) pixels in the output grid. All other pixels (red, gray, etc.) retain their original color and position.
4.  **Identifying the Pattern:** The change from white (0) to green (3) doesn't happen to *all* white pixels. It seems dependent on the pixel's position relative to red (2) and gray (8) pixels.
5.  **Boundary Colors:** Red (2) and gray (8) pixels appear to function as boundaries or walls within the grid.
6.  **Parity Check Hypothesis:** The transformation rule seems related to a parity check (odd/even count). For a given white pixel, counting the number of boundary pixels (red or gray) encountered when moving horizontally from the left edge, or vertically from the top edge, determines if the pixel should change color. If the count of boundary pixels to the left is odd, OR the count of boundary pixels above is odd, the white pixel becomes green.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Change specific white pixels to green based on their position relative to boundary pixels (red or gray).

grid_elements:
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Can be white(0), red(2), green(3), gray(8), or others.
      - position: Defined by row and column index (r, c).

boundary_pixels:
  - color: red (2)
  - color: gray (8)
  description: These pixels act as boundaries for the transformation rule.

target_pixels:
  - color: white (0)
  description: These are the only pixels eligible for transformation.

output_pixels:
  - color: green (3)
  description: The color assigned to transformed white pixels.

transformation_rule:
  action: change_color
  input_color: white (0)
  output_color: green (3)
  condition:
    type: parity_check
    operands:
      - count_left: Number of boundary pixels (red or gray) in the same row, strictly to the left of the target pixel.
      - count_above: Number of boundary pixels (red or gray) in the same column, strictly above the target pixel.
    logic: The change occurs if (count_left is odd) OR (count_above is odd).

invariants:
  - Pixels that are not white (0) in the input remain unchanged in the output.
  - White (0) pixels that do not meet the parity check condition remain white (0) in the output.
  - Grid dimensions remain the same.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.
3.  Check if the color of the current pixel `input_grid[r][c]` is white (0).
4.  If the pixel is white (0):
    a.  Initialize `count_left = 0`. Iterate from column `i = 0` up to `c - 1` in the current row `r`. If `input_grid[r][i]` is red (2) or gray (8), increment `count_left`.
    b.  Initialize `count_above = 0`. Iterate from row `j = 0` up to `r - 1` in the current column `c`. If `input_grid[j][c]` is red (2) or gray (8), increment `count_above`.
    c.  Check if `count_left` is odd OR `count_above` is odd.
    d.  If the condition in step 4c is true, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid `output_grid[r][c]` to green (3).
5.  If the pixel is not white (0) (checked in step 3), its value in the output grid remains the same as the input grid (this is implicitly handled by starting with a copy).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
