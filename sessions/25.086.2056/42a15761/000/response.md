Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Composition**: The grids are primarily composed of red (2) and white (0) pixels. The white pixels often appear in vertical columns, acting as separators.
2.  **Input/Output Relationship**: The input and output grids in each example have the same dimensions. The transformation involves changing the color of specific pixels from white (0) to red (2). No pixels change from red to white, or to any other color.
3.  **Pattern Structure**: The grids often display repeating patterns, particularly `2 2 2` and `2 0 2`, separated by columns of white (0).
4.  **Localized Changes**: The changes (white to red) are not random but occur at specific locations based on the local neighborhood of the white pixel.
5.  **Neighborhood Dependency**: By comparing input and output grids, it appears that a white pixel changes to red only if it meets specific conditions related to its immediate neighbors. Specifically, a white pixel at `(r, c)` seems to change to red if its left neighbor `(r, c-1)`, right neighbor `(r, c+1)`, and bottom neighbor `(r+1, c)` are all red.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions: Input and output grids have identical dimensions in each example.
    - colors_present: Primarily red (2) and white (0).
    - structure: Grids often contain vertical columns of white pixels separating blocks/patterns of red pixels.
transformation:
  type: Local pixel update based on neighborhood conditions.
  input_pixels_affected: Only white (0) pixels can potentially change.
  output_pixels_affected: Affected white pixels change to red (2).
  conditions_for_change:
    - target_pixel_color: Must be white (0).
    - neighbor_colors:
        - left_neighbor: Must be red (2).
        - right_neighbor: Must be red (2).
        - bottom_neighbor: Must be red (2).
    - location_constraints: The target pixel cannot be in the last row (requires a bottom neighbor) or in the first/last column (requires both left and right neighbors).
  unchanged_pixels: All pixels that do not meet the conditions for change retain their original color from the input grid.
objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: (0-9, mainly 0 and 2)
      - location: (row, column)
  - type: Pattern
    properties:
      - shape: Horizontal sequences like `2 0 2` or `2 2 2`.
      - context: Often appear within blocks separated by white columns.
relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    entities: [Pixel, Pixel]
    directions: [left, right, up, down]
  - type: Conditionality
    description: The change in a pixel's color depends on the color of its adjacent neighbors (left, right, down).
actions:
  - name: Update color
    target: White pixel
    condition: If left, right, and bottom neighbors are red.
    result: Target pixel becomes red.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid (output grid) identical to the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid, examining its row `r` and column `c`, focusing on pixels that could potentially change based on neighbor availability. Specifically, iterate through rows `r` from 0 up to (but not including) the last row, and columns `c` from 1 up to (but not including) the last column.
3.  For each considered pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid:
    a.  Check if the pixel's color is white (0).
    b.  If it is white, then check the colors of its immediate neighbors:
        i.  The pixel to the left at `(r, c-1)`.
        ii. The pixel to the right at `(r, c+1)`.
        iii. The pixel below at `(r+1, c)`.
    c.  If the pixel at `(r, c)` is white AND the left neighbor is red (2) AND the right neighbor is red (2) AND the bottom neighbor is red (2), then change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to red (2).
4.  After checking all applicable pixels, return the completed output grid.
