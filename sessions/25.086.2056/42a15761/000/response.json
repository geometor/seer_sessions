The white pixels often appear in vertical columns, acting as separators.\n2.  **Input/Output Relationship**: The input and output grids in each example have the same dimensions. The transformation involves changing the color of specific pixels from white (0) to red (2). No pixels change from red to white, or to any other color.\n3.  **Pattern Structure**: The grids often display repeating patterns, particularly `2 2 2` and `2 0 2`, separated by columns of white (0).\n4.  **Localized Changes**: The changes (white to red) are not random but occur at specific locations based on the local neighborhood of the white pixel.\n5.  **Neighborhood Dependency**: By comparing input and output grids, it appears that a white pixel changes to red only if it meets specific conditions related to its immediate neighbors. Specifically, a white pixel at `(r, c)` seems to change to red if its left neighbor `(r, c-1)`, right neighbor `(r, c+1)`, and bottom neighbor `(r+1, c)` are all red.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
