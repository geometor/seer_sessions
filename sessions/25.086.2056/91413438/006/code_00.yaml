task_description: Transforms a 3x3 input grid containing white (0) and one other non-white color (C) into a larger square output grid of size S x S by tiling the input pattern.

input_properties:
  - grid_size: 3x3
  - content: Contains white pixels (0) and pixels of exactly one other color (C).
  - non_white_colors_observed: [2 (red), 3 (green), 4 (yellow), 6 (magenta)]

output_properties:
  - grid_size: S x S, where S is determined by the input color C.
  - content: A tiled pattern in the top-left corner, with the rest of the grid being white (0).
  - output_sizes_observed: [9x9, 15x15, 18x18, 12x12]

transformation:
  - name: Identify Color C
    description: Find the single non-white color value (C) in the input 3x3 grid.
  - name: Determine Parameters
    description: Based on the color C, determine the horizontal repetition factor (H_rep), vertical repetition factor (V_rep), and the output grid side length (S).
    mapping:
      - color_c: 2 (red)
        h_rep: 3
        v_rep: 1
        size_s: 18
      - color_c: 3 (green)
        h_rep: 3

  - name: Create Output Grid
    description: Initialize an S x S grid filled with white (0).
  - name: Tile Pattern
    description: Repeat the 3x3 input grid pattern H_rep times horizontally and V_rep times vertically. Place this resulting (V_rep * 3) x (H_rep * 3) pattern into the top-left corner (position 0,0) of the output grid.
