Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs are consistently 3x3 grids containing white (0) and one other color. The outputs are larger square grids, with sizes varying across examples (9x9, 15x15, 18x18, 12x12).
2.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental operation appears to be tiling or repeating the 3x3 input pattern within the output grid.
3.  **Tiling Pattern:** The input pattern is replicated multiple times horizontally and vertically to form a rectangular block in the top-left corner of the output grid.
4.  **Determining Factors:** The number of horizontal repetitions (`H_rep`), the number of vertical repetitions (`V_rep`), and the final size (`S x S`) of the output grid seem to be determined by the specific non-white color (`C`) present in the input grid.
5.  **Padding:** The area of the output grid outside the tiled region is filled with the background color, white (0).
6.  **Color-Dependency Mapping:** By analyzing the examples, we can observe a specific mapping between the input color `C` and the parameters `H_rep`, `V_rep`, and `S`:
    *   If C = 2 (Red): H_rep = 3, V_rep = 1, S = 18. Tiled area: (1\*3)x(3\*3) = 3x9.
    *   If C = 3 (Green): H_rep = 3, V_rep = 2, S = 9. Tiled area: (2\*3)x(3\*3) = 6x9.
    *   If C = 4 (Yellow): H_rep = 4, V_rep = 1, S = 15. Tiled area: (1\*3)x(4\*3) = 3x12.
    *   If C = 6 (Magenta): H_rep = 4, V_rep = 2, S = 12. Tiled area: (2\*3)x(4\*3) = 6x12.
    The count or arrangement of the colored pixels within the input grid does not seem to affect these parameters, only the color value itself.

## Facts


```yaml
Input:
  - type: grid
    attributes:
      height: 3
      width: 3
      pixels:
        - color: white (0)
        - color: C (a single non-white color, varies per example: 2, 3, 4, or 6)

Output:
  - type: grid
    attributes:
      height: S
      width: S
      pixels:
        - color: white (0)
        - color: C (same as input non-white color)

Parameters:
  - name: input_color (C)
    value: The single non-white color value present in the input grid.
  - name: horizontal_repetitions (H_rep)
    derivation: Determined by a lookup based on C.
      - C=2 -> H_rep=3
      - C=3 -> H_rep=3
      - C=4 -> H_rep=4
      - C=6 -> H_rep=4
  - name: vertical_repetitions (V_rep)
    derivation: Determined by a lookup based on C.
      - C=2 -> V_rep=1
      - C=3 -> V_rep=2
      - C=4 -> V_rep=1
      - C=6 -> V_rep=2
  - name: output_size (S)
    derivation: Determined by a lookup based on C.
      - C=2 -> S=18
      - C=3 -> S=9
      - C=4 -> S=15
      - C=6 -> S=12

Transformation:
  - action: identify_color
    input: input_grid
    output: color C
  - action: lookup_parameters
    input: color C
    output: H_rep, V_rep, S
  - action: create_grid
    attributes:
      height: S
      width: S
      fill_color: white (0)
    output: output_grid
  - action: tile_pattern
    input_grid: input_grid (3x3)
    target_grid: output_grid
    horizontal_repeats: H_rep
    vertical_repeats: V_rep
    target_area: Top-left corner, size (V_rep * 3) x (H_rep * 3)

Relationships:
  - The non-white color (C) in the input dictates the tiling factors (H_rep, V_rep) and the overall output grid size (S) via a predefined mapping.
  - The output grid consists of the input pattern tiled H_rep x V_rep times in the top-left, with the remaining area filled with white.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Examine the 3x3 input grid and identify the single non-white color value present; let this color be `C`.
2.  Determine the horizontal repetition factor (`H_rep`), vertical repetition factor (`V_rep`), and output grid size (`S`) based on the value of `C` using the following rules:
    *   If `C` is 2 (Red), set `H_rep` = 3, `V_rep` = 1, and `S` = 18.
    *   If `C` is 3 (Green), set `H_rep` = 3, `V_rep` = 2, and `S` = 9.
    *   If `C` is 4 (Yellow), set `H_rep` = 4, `V_rep` = 1, and `S` = 15.
    *   If `C` is 6 (Magenta), set `H_rep` = 4, `V_rep` = 2, and `S` = 12.
3.  Create a new square grid of size `S` x `S`, initially filled entirely with white (0). This will be the output grid.
4.  Calculate the dimensions of the region to be tiled: `Tiled_Height = V_rep * 3` and `Tiled_Width = H_rep * 3`.
5.  Iterate `V_rep` times vertically and `H_rep` times horizontally. In each iteration, copy the entire 3x3 input grid pattern into the corresponding 3x3 block within the top-left `Tiled_Height` x `Tiled_Width` region of the output grid. Specifically, for the `v`-th vertical repetition (0 to `V_rep`-1) and `h`-th horizontal repetition (0 to `H_rep`-1), copy the input grid to the output grid block starting at row `v * 3` and column `h * 3`.
6.  The resulting `S` x `S` grid, containing the tiled pattern in the top-left and white padding elsewhere, is the final output.
