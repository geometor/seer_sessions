The outputs are larger square grids, with sizes varying across examples (9x9, 15x15, 18x18, 12x12).\n2.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental operation appears to be tiling or repeating the 3x3 input pattern within the output grid.\n3.  **Tiling Pattern:** The input pattern is replicated multiple times horizontally and vertically to form a rectangular block in the top-left corner of the output grid.\n4.  **Determining Factors:** The number of horizontal repetitions (`H_rep`), the number of vertical repetitions (`V_rep`), and the final size (`S x S`) of the output grid seem to be determined by the specific non-white color (`C`) present in the input grid.\n5.  **Padding:** The area of the output grid outside the tiled region is filled with the background color, white (0).\n6.  **Color-Dependency Mapping:** By analyzing the examples, we can observe a specific mapping between the input color `C` and the parameters `H_rep`, `V_rep`, and `S`:\n    *   If C = 2 (Red): H_rep = 3, V_rep = 1, S = 18. Tiled area: (1\\*3)x(3\\*3) = 3x9.\n    *   If C = 3 (Green): H_rep = 3, V_rep = 2, S = 9. Tiled area: (2\\*3)x(3\\*3) = 6x9.\n    *   If C = 4 (Yellow): H_rep = 4, V_rep = 1, S = 15. Tiled area: (1\\*3)x(4\\*3) = 3x12.\n    *   If C = 6 (Magenta): H_rep = 4, V_rep = 2, S = 12. Tiled area: (2\\*3)x(4\\*3) = 6x12.\n    The count or arrangement of the colored pixels within the input grid does not seem to affect these parameters, only the color value itself.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Determine the horizontal repetition factor (`H_rep`), vertical repetition factor (`V_rep`), and output grid size (`S`) based on the value of `C` using the following rules:\n    *   If `C` is 2 (Red), set `H_rep` = 3, `V_rep` = 1, and `S` = 18.\n    *   If `C` is 3 (Green), set `H_rep` = 3, `V_rep` = 2, and `S` = 9.\n    *   If `C` is 4 (Yellow), set `H_rep` = 4, `V_rep` = 1, and `S` = 15.\n    *   If `C` is 6 (Magenta), set `H_rep` = 4, `V_rep` = 2, and `S` = 12.\n3.  Create a new square grid of size `S` x `S`, initially filled entirely with white (0). This will be the output grid.\n4.  Calculate the dimensions of the region to be tiled: `Tiled_Height = V_rep * 3` and `Tiled_Width = H_rep * 3`.\n5.  Iterate `V_rep` times vertically and `H_rep` times horizontally. In each iteration, copy the entire 3x3 input grid pattern into the corresponding 3x3 block within the top-left `Tiled_Height` x `Tiled_Width` region of the output grid. Specifically, for the `v`-th vertical repetition (0 to `V_rep`-1) and `h`-th horizontal repetition (0 to `H_rep`-1), copy the input grid to the output grid block starting at row `v * 3` and column `h * 3`.\n6.  The resulting `S` x `S` grid, containing the tiled pattern in the top-left and white padding elsewhere, is the final output."
