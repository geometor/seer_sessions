Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Grids:** Both inputs and outputs are rectangular grids of pixels, represented by integer color values (0-9).
*   **Vertical Structures:** The input grids visually appear to be composed of distinct vertical sections or "stripes". These stripes are primarily made of one color but can contain pixels of other colors within them.
*   **Stripe Colors & Boundaries:** In each example, the grid is divided into 2, 3, or 4 major vertical stripes. The dominant colors defining these stripes change from example to example (e.g., gray/orange/maroon in train_1, azure/maroon/blue/green in train_2). The boundaries between these stripes appear to be vertical lines spanning the height of the grid.
*   **Transformation:** The output grids retain the same dimensions (height and width) and the same pixels as the input grids. However, the order of the vertical stripes is reversed. The leftmost stripe in the input becomes the rightmost in the output, the second leftmost becomes the second rightmost, and so on.
*   **Internal Consistency:** The internal structure of each vertical stripe (including any non-dominant colored pixels within it) is preserved during the reversal. The pixels within a stripe maintain their relative positions within that stripe.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_name: reverse_vertical_stripes
description: Reverses the order of vertical stripes identified within the input grid.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (integers 0-9).
  - element: vertical_stripe
    description: >
      A contiguous block of columns within the grid, visually characterized
      by a dominant background color, though interspersed pixels of other
      colors may exist. Stripes span the full height of the grid.
    properties:
      - width: The number of columns in the stripe.
      - column_range: The starting and ending column indices of the stripe.
      - content: The sub-grid corresponding to the stripe's pixels.

relationships:
  - relationship: division
    source: grid
    target: vertical_stripe
    description: The input grid is divided into a sequence of vertical stripes arranged horizontally.
  - relationship: sequence
    elements: vertical_stripe
    description: The vertical stripes appear in a specific left-to-right order in the input grid.

actions:
  - action: identify_stripes
    description: >
      Determine the boundaries of the vertical stripes. A simple heuristic
      is to look for changes in pixel color along the first row to define
      the column boundaries of the stripes.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - list_of_stripes (ordered left-to-right, each with content and column range)
  - action: reverse_order
    description: Reverse the sequence of the identified stripes.
    inputs:
      - list_of_stripes
    outputs:
      - reversed_list_of_stripes
  - action: reconstruct_grid
    description: >
      Assemble the output grid by concatenating the stripe contents
      horizontally according to the reversed order.
    inputs:
      - reversed_list_of_stripes
      - original_grid_dimensions
    outputs:
      - output_grid

transformation_goal: >
  Produce an output grid where the vertical stripes identified in the input grid
  are arranged in reverse horizontal order, while preserving the internal content
  of each stripe.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Identify the distinct vertical stripes within the input grid. Assume the boundaries between stripes are defined by the columns where the color changes in the first row of the grid.
3.  For each stripe identified, store its content (the sub-grid corresponding to its columns) and its original column range. Create an ordered list of these stripes from left to right.
4.  Reverse the order of the stripes in the list.
5.  Create a new, empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
6.  Iterate through the reversed list of stripes. Place the content of each stripe into the output grid, starting from the leftmost column and proceeding rightwards, ensuring the columns are filled contiguously according to the widths of the stripes in their reversed order.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
