These stripes are primarily made of one color but can contain pixels of other colors within them.\n*   **Stripe Colors & Boundaries:** In each example, the grid is divided into 2, 3, or 4 major vertical stripes. The dominant colors defining these stripes change from example to example (e.g., gray/orange/maroon in train_1, azure/maroon/blue/green in train_2). The boundaries between these stripes appear to be vertical lines spanning the height of the grid.\n*   **Transformation:** The output grids retain the same dimensions (height and width) and the same pixels as the input grids. However, the order of the vertical stripes is reversed. The leftmost stripe in the input becomes the rightmost in the output, the second leftmost becomes the second rightmost, and so on.\n*   **Internal Consistency:** The internal structure of each vertical stripe (including any non-dominant colored pixels within it) is preserved during the reversal. The pixels within a stripe maintain their relative positions within that stripe.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
