task_name: reverse_vertical_stripes
description: Reverses the order of vertical stripes identified within the input grid.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (integers 0-9).
  - element: vertical_stripe
    description: >
      A contiguous block of columns within the grid, visually characterized
      by a dominant background color, though interspersed pixels of other
      colors may exist. Stripes span the full height of the grid.
    properties:
      - width: The number of columns in the stripe.
      - column_range: The starting and ending column indices of the stripe.
      - content: The sub-grid corresponding to the stripe's pixels.

relationships:
  - relationship: division
    source: grid
    target: vertical_stripe
    description: The input grid is divided into a sequence of vertical stripes arranged horizontally.
  - relationship: sequence
    elements: vertical_stripe
    description: The vertical stripes appear in a specific left-to-right order in the input grid.

actions:
  - action: identify_stripes
    description: >
      Determine the boundaries of the vertical stripes. A simple heuristic
      is to look for changes in pixel color along the first row to define
      the column boundaries of the stripes.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - list_of_stripes (ordered left-to-right, each with content and column range)
  - action: reverse_order
    description: Reverse the sequence of the identified stripes.
    inputs:
      - list_of_stripes
    outputs:
      - reversed_list_of_stripes
  - action: reconstruct_grid
    description: >
      Assemble the output grid by concatenating the stripe contents
      horizontally according to the reversed order.
    inputs:
      - reversed_list_of_stripes
      - original_grid_dimensions
    outputs:
      - output_grid

transformation_goal: >
  Produce an output grid where the vertical stripes identified in the input grid
  are arranged in reverse horizontal order, while preserving the internal content
  of each stripe.
