task_description: Fill enclosed white regions (holes) within colored objects based on the number and size of the holes.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous group of non-white pixels (using 8-way connectivity).
  - hole: A contiguous group of white pixels (using 4-way connectivity) that is enclosed by a single object and does not touch the grid border.
  - hole_size: The number of pixels constituting a hole.

observations:
  - Input grids contain one or more colored objects.
  - Objects can enclose zero, one, or two distinct holes.
  - Holes can be of size 1 pixel or larger.
  - The background white area is ignored.

actions:
  - Identify all distinct colored objects.
  - For each object, identify all enclosed holes.
  - Count the number of enclosed holes for each object.
  - Determine the size of each enclosed hole.
  - Apply fill color based on rules:
    - If an object has exactly one enclosed hole:
      - If the hole_size is 1, fill the hole with gray (5).
      - If the hole_size is greater than 1, fill the hole with orange (7).
    - If an object has exactly two enclosed holes:
      - Fill both holes with orange (7).
  - Objects with zero holes remain unchanged.
  - The pixels of the objects themselves remain unchanged.
