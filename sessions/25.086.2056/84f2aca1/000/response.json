            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 2D grids of pixels with different colors. The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct, contiguous shapes. These shapes often resemble letters ('B') or numbers ('8'), but their exact form varies slightly. Each shape is composed of a single color (yellow, azure, green, red).\n3.  **Holes:** Within some of these colored shapes, there are enclosed areas of white pixels. These are the \"holes\" or internal regions.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of these white holes based on certain criteria. The shapes themselves and the background remain unchanged.\n5.  **Color Changes:** The holes are filled with either orange (7) or gray (5).\n\n**Analysis of Transformation Logic:**\n\nBy comparing the input and output pairs, we observe a pattern related to the number of holes within each colored shape:\n\n*   **Shapes with Two Holes:** In `train_1`, `train_3` (yellow, green top-right, green mid-right, red bottom-right), and `train_4` (green mid-left, azure bottom-left), the shapes contain *two* distinct, vertically stacked enclosed white regions. In the output, *both* of these holes are filled with orange (7).\n*   **Shapes with One Hole:** In `train_2`, `train_3` (red bottom-middle), and `train_4` (yellow, red, green mid-right), the shapes contain only *one* enclosed white region. In the output, this single hole is filled with gray (5). Note that some shapes might visually resemble an '8' but topologically only enclose one region due to how the pixels connect (e.g., `train_2`, `train_4` yellow/red/green '8's).\n\nThe color of the original shape does not seem to determine the fill color; rather, the *number* of enclosed holes is the deciding factor.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
