"""
Identifies all separate, connected groups (objects) of a single non-white color in the input grid.
Calculates the size (number of pixels) of each object.
Finds the largest size among all objects.
Creates a new output grid initialized with white (0) pixels.
Copies only the object(s) matching the largest size from the input grid to the output grid at their original positions.
Connectivity is defined as adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right).
