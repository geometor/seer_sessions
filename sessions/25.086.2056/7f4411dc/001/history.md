*   **Perception:** The task involves identifying distinct connected shapes (objects) of a single color (magenta, orange, or gray) on a white background. The transformation rule appears to select and preserve only the largest object based on the number of pixels it contains, removing all other smaller objects and isolated pixels of the same color. The background remains white.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task: filter_largest_object
    input_elements:
      - type: grid
        description: A 2D array of pixels.
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
        description: The predominant pixel color.
      - type: objects
        description: Contiguous blocks of a single non-white color.
        properties:
          - color: magenta (6), orange (7), or gray (5)
          - size: number of pixels in the object
          - position: coordinates of pixels within the grid
    output_elements:
      - type: grid
        description: A 2D array of pixels, same dimensions as the input.
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
      - type: object
        description: The single largest contiguous block of the non-white color from the input grid. If there are multiple objects of the same largest size, all are kept (though this doesn't occur in the examples).
        properties:
          - color: Same as the input objects' color.
          - size: Maximum size among all input objects.
          - position: Same coordinates as in the input grid.
    transformation:
      input_object_selection: Identify all contiguous objects of the non-white color.
      property_calculation: Calculate the size (pixel count) for each identified object.
      filtering_criteria: Determine the maximum size among all objects.
      output_construction: Create an output grid filled with the background color. Copy only the object(s) matching the maximum size from the input grid to the output grid at their original positions.
    ```

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all separate, connected groups (objects) of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    2.  Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each identified object.
    3.  Find the largest size among all the objects.
    4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
    5.  For every object in the input grid whose size equals the largest size found, copy those pixels to the corresponding positions in the output grid.
