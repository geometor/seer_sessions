def transform(input_grid):
    """
    The input grid is divided into two halves (left and right) by a central vertical gray line. 
    The output grid has the dimensions of the left half of the input grid.
    
    The transformation rule involves comparing corresponding pixels in the left and right halves:
    1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the left half of the input grid.
    2. For each pixel position (r, c) in the output grid:
       - Let 'left_val' be the value at (r, c) in the input grid.
       - Let 'right_val' be the value at (r, c + mid + 1) in the input grid, where 'mid' is the column index of the gray line.
       - If 'left_val' is white (0) and 'right_val' is non-white: Set the output pixel at (r, c) to blue (1).
       - If 'left_val' is non-white and 'right_val' is white (0): Set the output pixel at (r, c) to red (2).
       - Otherwise (both white or both non-white): The output pixel at (r, c) retains its initial value (copied from the left half).
