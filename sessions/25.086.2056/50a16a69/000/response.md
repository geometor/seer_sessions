*   **Perception**: Each task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions. The input grids contain repeating horizontal patterns, often with a distinct "delimiter" color marking the end of the pattern area or filling the remaining space, typically in the bottom rows and/or rightmost columns. The output grids are completely filled with patterns derived from the input patterns. The core transformation seems to involve identifying the repeating unit in each input row (excluding delimiters), cyclically shifting this unit to the left by one position, and then tiling this shifted unit across the entire corresponding output row. The delimiter color seems to be consistently located at the bottom-right corner of the input grid.

```yaml
    task: Row Pattern Shift and Tile
    
    grid_properties:
      - input_output_shape_match: True
    
    objects:
      - name: Delimiter
        property: Color of the bottom-right pixel in the input grid.
        role: Marks the boundary of the relevant pattern area within each input row.
      - name: RowSequence
        property: The sequence of colors in an input row from the start up to the first occurrence of the Delimiter color (or the full row if Delimiter is absent).
      - name: RowPattern
        property: The shortest repeating sequence of colors that generates the RowSequence when repeated (potentially truncated at the end).
        relationship: Derived from RowSequence.
      - name: ShiftedPattern
        property: The RowPattern cyclically shifted one position to the left.
        relationship: Derived from RowPattern.
    
    transformation:
      - action: Identify Delimiter color from input grid's bottom-right pixel.
      - action: For each input row:
          - step: Determine the RowSequence by stopping at the Delimiter color.
          - step: Find the RowPattern within the RowSequence.
          - step: Compute the ShiftedPattern from the RowPattern.
      - action: Construct Output Grid:
          - step: Initialize output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
          - step: For each output row, fill it completely by tiling the corresponding ShiftedPattern.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Determine the dimensions (height H, width W) of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the delimiter color by taking the color of the pixel at coordinates (H-1, W-1) in the input grid.
    3.  Create a new output grid of dimensions H x W.
    4.  For each row index `r` from 0 to H-1:
        a.  Find the sequence of colors `S` in the input grid's row `r`, starting from column 0 and stopping just before the first occurrence of the delimiter color. If the delimiter color is not present in the row, use the entire row as `S`.
        b.  Find the shortest repeating pattern `P` that constitutes the sequence `S`. This is the shortest prefix of `S` which, when repeated, matches `S` (the last repetition might be partial).
        c.  Create a shifted pattern `P_shifted` by moving the first color of `P` to the end of `P`.
        d.  Fill row `r` of the output grid by repeating the `P_shifted` pattern until all W columns are filled. The repetition should cycle through `P_shifted` as needed.
    5.  Return the fully constructed output grid.
