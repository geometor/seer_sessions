            "text": "*   **Perception**: Each task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions. The input grids contain repeating horizontal patterns, often with a distinct \"delimiter\" color marking the end of the pattern area or filling the remaining space, typically in the bottom rows and/or rightmost columns. The output grids are completely filled with patterns derived from the input patterns. The core transformation seems to involve identifying the repeating unit in each input row (excluding delimiters), cyclically shifting this unit to the left by one position, and then tiling this shifted unit across the entire corresponding output row. The delimiter color seems to be consistently located at the bottom-right corner of the input grid.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
