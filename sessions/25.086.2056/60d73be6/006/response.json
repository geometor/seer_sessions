            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code attempted a reflection transformation where pixels were reflected across a detected axis (a solid horizontal or vertical line of a single non-background color), overwriting the destination cells. The results show that the `Transformed Output` is identical to the `Input` in examples 2 and 3, and only slightly different (but still incorrect) in example 1. This indicates that the reflection logic, specifically the part that modifies the output grid based on reflected coordinates, is not producing the desired changes.\n\nThe core discrepancy seems to be that the transformation should *copy* the pixels to their reflected positions, rather than just calculating the position and potentially overwriting. The `Expected Output` grids show the original non-background, non-axis pixels *plus* their reflections. The original pixels are retained in their initial positions. The reflection appears to add the reflected pixel's color to the corresponding reflected location, overwriting whatever was there (including background pixels).\n\nThe strategy will be to re-analyze the examples, confirming the \"copy and reflect\" hypothesis, and then update the natural language program to accurately describe this process.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between input, expected output, and the previously transformed output for each example.\n\nExample 1:\n*   Input Size: 10x15\n*   Output Size: 10x15\n*   Background Color: Orange (7)\n*   Axis: Horizontal, Blue (1), Row 4 (0-indexed)\n*   Input Pixels (Non-bg, Non-axis): Various colors at different positions above and below the axis.\n*   Expected Output vs Input: The output contains all the original non-background pixels *plus* new pixels. These new pixels correspond exactly to the reflection of the original non-background, non-axis pixels across the blue line at row 4.\n    *   e.g., Input[0, 8] (Blue/1) reflects to Output[8, 8] (Blue/1). Input[0, 8] is still Blue/1 in Output.\n    *   e.g., Input[1, 10] (Yellow/4) reflects to Output[7, 10] (Yellow/4). Input[1, 10] is still Yellow/4 in Output.\n    *   e.g., Input[3, 14] (Gray/5) reflects to Output[5, 14] (Gray/5). Input[3, 14] is still Gray/5 in Output.\n*   Previous Transformed Output vs Expected Output: The previous code failed to place *any* reflected pixels.\n\nExample 2:\n*   Input Size: 11x11\n*   Output Size: 11x11\n*   Background Color: Orange (7)\n*   Axis: Vertical, Magenta (6), Column 5 (0-indexed)\n*   Input Pixels (Non-bg, Non-axis): Various colors to the left of the axis. No non-background, non-axis pixels to the right.\n*   Expected Output vs Input: The output contains all the original non-background pixels *plus* new pixels. These new pixels correspond exactly to the reflection of the original non-background, non-axis pixels across the magenta line at column 5.\n    *   e.g., Input[0, 0] (Blue/1) reflects to Output[0, 10] (Blue/1). Input[0, 0] is still Blue/1 in Output.\n    *   e.g., Input[1, 0] (Red/2) reflects to Output[1, 9] (Red/2). Input[1, 0] is still Red/2 in Output.\n    *   e.g., Input[4, 1] (Azure/8) reflects to Output[4, 9] (Azure/8). Input[4, 1] is still Azure/8 in Output.\n*   Previous Transformed Output vs Expected Output: The previous code failed to place *any* reflected pixels.\n\nExample 3:\n*   Input Size: 8x8\n*   Output Size: 8x8\n*   Background Color: Orange (7)\n*   Axis: Vertical, Green (3), Column 3 (0-indexed)\n*   Input Pixels (Non-bg, Non-axis): Various colors to the right of the axis. No non-background, non-axis pixels to the left.\n*   Expected Output vs Input: The output contains all the original non-background pixels *plus* new pixels. These new pixels correspond exactly to the reflection of the original non-background, non-axis pixels across the green line at column 3.\n    *   e.g., Input[0, 4] (Azure/8) reflects to Output[0, 2] (Azure/8). Input[0, 4] is still Azure/8 in Output.\n    *   e.g., Input[1, 6] (Magenta/6) reflects to Output[1, 0] (Magenta/6). Input[1, 6] is still Magenta/6 in Output.\n    *   e.g., Input[2, 5] (Red/2) reflects to Output[2, 1] (Red/2). Input[2, 5] is still Red/2 in Output.\n*   Previous Transformed Output vs Expected Output: The previous code failed to place *any* reflected pixels.\n\n**Findings:**\n\nThe transformation consistently involves:\n1.  Identifying the background color (Orange/7).\n2.  Identifying a single, complete horizontal or vertical axis line composed of a single, non-background color.\n3.  Initializing the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.\n4.  Iterating through each pixel of the input grid.\n5.  If a pixel is non-background and not on the axis line, its position is reflected across the axis.\n6.  The *color* of the original pixel is then placed at the calculated reflected position *in the output grid*, overwriting whatever color was previously at that location (even if it was part of the initial copy). The original pixel remains unchanged in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
