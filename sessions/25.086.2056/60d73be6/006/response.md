**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempted a reflection transformation where pixels were reflected across a detected axis (a solid horizontal or vertical line of a single non-background color), overwriting the destination cells. The results show that the `Transformed Output` is identical to the `Input` in examples 2 and 3, and only slightly different (but still incorrect) in example 1. This indicates that the reflection logic, specifically the part that modifies the output grid based on reflected coordinates, is not producing the desired changes.

The core discrepancy seems to be that the transformation should *copy* the pixels to their reflected positions, rather than just calculating the position and potentially overwriting. The `Expected Output` grids show the original non-background, non-axis pixels *plus* their reflections. The original pixels are retained in their initial positions. The reflection appears to add the reflected pixel's color to the corresponding reflected location, overwriting whatever was there (including background pixels).

The strategy will be to re-analyze the examples, confirming the "copy and reflect" hypothesis, and then update the natural language program to accurately describe this process.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

Let's analyze the relationship between input, expected output, and the previously transformed output for each example.

Example 1:
*   Input Size: 10x15
*   Output Size: 10x15
*   Background Color: Orange (7)
*   Axis: Horizontal, Blue (1), Row 4 (0-indexed)
*   Input Pixels (Non-bg, Non-axis): Various colors at different positions above and below the axis.
*   Expected Output vs Input: The output contains all the original non-background pixels *plus* new pixels. These new pixels correspond exactly to the reflection of the original non-background, non-axis pixels across the blue line at row 4.
    *   e.g., Input[0, 8] (Blue/1) reflects to Output[8, 8] (Blue/1). Input[0, 8] is still Blue/1 in Output.
    *   e.g., Input[1, 10] (Yellow/4) reflects to Output[7, 10] (Yellow/4). Input[1, 10] is still Yellow/4 in Output.
    *   e.g., Input[3, 14] (Gray/5) reflects to Output[5, 14] (Gray/5). Input[3, 14] is still Gray/5 in Output.
*   Previous Transformed Output vs Expected Output: The previous code failed to place *any* reflected pixels.

Example 2:
*   Input Size: 11x11
*   Output Size: 11x11
*   Background Color: Orange (7)
*   Axis: Vertical, Magenta (6), Column 5 (0-indexed)
*   Input Pixels (Non-bg, Non-axis): Various colors to the left of the axis. No non-background, non-axis pixels to the right.
*   Expected Output vs Input: The output contains all the original non-background pixels *plus* new pixels. These new pixels correspond exactly to the reflection of the original non-background, non-axis pixels across the magenta line at column 5.
    *   e.g., Input[0, 0] (Blue/1) reflects to Output[0, 10] (Blue/1). Input[0, 0] is still Blue/1 in Output.
    *   e.g., Input[1, 0] (Red/2) reflects to Output[1, 9] (Red/2). Input[1, 0] is still Red/2 in Output.
    *   e.g., Input[4, 1] (Azure/8) reflects to Output[4, 9] (Azure/8). Input[4, 1] is still Azure/8 in Output.
*   Previous Transformed Output vs Expected Output: The previous code failed to place *any* reflected pixels.

Example 3:
*   Input Size: 8x8
*   Output Size: 8x8
*   Background Color: Orange (7)
*   Axis: Vertical, Green (3), Column 3 (0-indexed)
*   Input Pixels (Non-bg, Non-axis): Various colors to the right of the axis. No non-background, non-axis pixels to the left.
*   Expected Output vs Input: The output contains all the original non-background pixels *plus* new pixels. These new pixels correspond exactly to the reflection of the original non-background, non-axis pixels across the green line at column 3.
    *   e.g., Input[0, 4] (Azure/8) reflects to Output[0, 2] (Azure/8). Input[0, 4] is still Azure/8 in Output.
    *   e.g., Input[1, 6] (Magenta/6) reflects to Output[1, 0] (Magenta/6). Input[1, 6] is still Magenta/6 in Output.
    *   e.g., Input[2, 5] (Red/2) reflects to Output[2, 1] (Red/2). Input[2, 5] is still Red/2 in Output.
*   Previous Transformed Output vs Expected Output: The previous code failed to place *any* reflected pixels.

**Findings:**

The transformation consistently involves:
1.  Identifying the background color (Orange/7).
2.  Identifying a single, complete horizontal or vertical axis line composed of a single, non-background color.
3.  Initializing the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
4.  Iterating through each pixel of the input grid.
5.  If a pixel is non-background and not on the axis line, its position is reflected across the axis.
6.  The *color* of the original pixel is then placed at the calculated reflected position *in the output grid*, overwriting whatever color was previously at that location (even if it was part of the initial copy). The original pixel remains unchanged in the output grid.

      - if (r_reflected, c_reflected) is within grid bounds:
          - set output_grid[r_reflected, c_reflected] = p.color
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the background color, which is consistently orange (7).
2.  Scan the input grid to find a single, complete horizontal or vertical line (the axis) composed entirely of a single color that is *not* the background color. Determine the axis's orientation (horizontal or vertical) and its index (row or column number).
3.  Create an output grid initially as an identical copy of the input grid.
4.  Iterate through every pixel in the input grid. For each pixel:
    a.  Check if the pixel's color is the background color. If yes, ignore it and proceed to the next pixel.
    b.  Check if the pixel lies on the identified axis. If yes, ignore it and proceed to the next pixel.
    c.  If the pixel is not background and not on the axis, calculate its reflected coordinates across the axis.
        i.  If the axis is horizontal at row `axis_row`, a pixel at `(r, c)` reflects to `(2 * axis_row - r, c)`.
        ii. If the axis is vertical at column `axis_col`, a pixel at `(r, c)` reflects to `(r, 2 * axis_col - c)`.
    d.  Check if the calculated reflected coordinates `(r_reflected, c_reflected)` fall within the bounds of the grid.
    e.  If the reflected coordinates are within bounds, update the *output grid* at `(r_reflected, c_reflected)` by setting its color to the *original pixel's* color. This overwrites any color previously at that position in the output grid.
5.  The final state of the output grid after checking all input pixels is the result.
