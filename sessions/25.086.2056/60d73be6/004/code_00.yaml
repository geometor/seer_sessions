task_context:
  description: "Reflects non-background, non-axis pixels across a single, complete line (axis) of a non-background color, overwriting the destination."
  grid_properties:
    - size: Variable height and width (up to 30x30).
    - background_color: Orange (7) consistently serves as the background/empty space.
  objects:
    - type: Axis
      description: A single, complete horizontal or vertical line composed of a single, non-background color. It acts as the line of reflection.
      properties:
        - orientation: horizontal or vertical
        - position: row index (for horizontal) or column index (for vertical)
        - color: any color except orange (7)
        - completeness: spans the full width or height of the grid without interruption by other colors.
    - type: Pixel Element
      description: Individual pixels considered for reflection.
      properties:
        - color: Any color except orange (7).
        - position: (row, col).
        - status: Can be 'on_axis' or 'off_axis'. Only 'off_axis' pixels are reflected.
  actions:
    - name: Identify Background
      details: Determine the background color (orange/7).
    - name: Identify Axis
      details: Locate the single, complete horizontal or vertical line of a uniform, non-background color. Record its orientation and position index.
    - name: Initialize Output
      details: Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
    - name: Reflect Pixels
      details: Iterate through each pixel (row, col) of the input grid. If the pixel's color is not background (7) and its position is not on the identified axis, calculate its reflected position (reflected_row, reflected_col).
    - name: Update Output Grid
      details: If the calculated reflected position is within the grid bounds, update the output grid at (reflected_row, reflected_col) with the color of the original pixel from the input grid at (row, col). This update overwrites the previous color at the reflected position in the output grid.
