```python
import numpy as np

"""
Reflects non-background, non-axis pixels across a single complete line (axis) of a non-background color, but only onto positions that are currently background color.

The transformation identifies a single complete horizontal or vertical line (axis) within the input grid that consists of a single, non-background color. This line acts as the axis of reflection. The background color is identified as orange (7). The output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid. The transformation then iterates through all pixels in the input grid. If a pixel's color is not the background color (7) and the pixel is not located on the identified axis, its position is mathematically reflected across the axis. If the calculated reflected position in the output grid currently contains the background color (7), the color of the original pixel is placed at that reflected position. If the reflected position already contains a non-background color (due to being part of the original input or a previously reflected pixel), it remains unchanged by the current reflection operation. Pixels on the axis and background pixels are not reflected and remain as they were in the initial copy.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code attempted to perform a reflection across a detected axis (a solid horizontal or vertical line of non-background color). The key observation from the failed examples is that the code's transformed output is almost identical to the input, while the expected output shows a clear reflection.

The discrepancy arises from the condition implemented in the previous code: `if output_grid[r_reflected, c_reflected] == background_color:`. This condition only allowed a pixel's reflection to be placed if the target destination cell was originally the background color (orange, 7). However, the expected outputs demonstrate that the reflection should occur and *overwrite* whatever color exists at the destination, provided the source pixel is not background, not on the axis, and the destination is within the grid bounds.

The strategy is to modify the transformation logic:
1.  Correctly identify the background color (orange, 7) and the axis (single complete non-background line).
2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input.
3.  Iterate through all non-background, non-axis pixels in the input.
4.  Calculate the reflection coordinates for each such pixel.
5.  If the reflected coordinates are valid (within grid bounds), update the *output grid* at the reflected coordinates with the *original pixel's color*, overwriting the existing content at that location.

**Metrics**

Let's confirm the properties observed:

*   **Background Color:** Appears to be consistently orange (7) in all examples.
*   **Axis:**
    *   Example 1: Horizontal line, row index 4, color blue (1).
    *   Example 2: Vertical line, column index 4, color magenta (6).
    *   Example 3: Vertical line, column index 3, color green (3).
    *   In all cases, the axis is a single, complete line of a uniform, non-background color.
*   **Transformation:** Reflection across the axis.
*   **Failure Cause:** The previous code failed because it incorrectly restricted reflection placement only onto background-colored cells. The correct behavior involves overwriting the destination cell with the reflected pixel's color, regardless of the destination's original color (unless the source pixel is background or on the axis).
*   **Pixel Mismatches:** The `Pixels Off` count corresponds precisely to the number of non-background, non-axis pixels whose reflected position in the input grid was *not* the background color. This confirms the faulty conditional logic.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  description: "Reflects non-background, non-axis pixels across a single, complete line (axis) of a non-background color, overwriting the destination."
  grid_properties:
    - size: Variable height and width (up to 30x30).
    - background_color: Orange (7) consistently serves as the background/empty space.
  objects:
    - type: Axis
      description: A single, complete horizontal or vertical line composed of a single, non-background color. It acts as the line of reflection.
      properties:
        - orientation: horizontal or vertical
        - position: row index (for horizontal) or column index (for vertical)
        - color: any color except orange (7)
        - completeness: spans the full width or height of the grid without interruption by other colors.
    - type: Pixel Element
      description: Individual pixels considered for reflection.
      properties:
        - color: Any color except orange (7).
        - position: (row, col).
        - status: Can be 'on_axis' or 'off_axis'. Only 'off_axis' pixels are reflected.
  actions:
    - name: Identify Background
      details: Determine the background color (orange/7).
    - name: Identify Axis
      details: Locate the single, complete horizontal or vertical line of a uniform, non-background color. Record its orientation and position index.
    - name: Initialize Output
      details: Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
    - name: Reflect Pixels
      details: Iterate through each pixel (row, col) of the input grid. If the pixel's color is not background (7) and its position is not on the identified axis, calculate its reflected position (reflected_row, reflected_col).
    - name: Update Output Grid
      details: If the calculated reflected position is within the grid bounds, update the output grid at (reflected_row, reflected_col) with the color of the original pixel from the input grid at (row, col). This update overwrites the previous color at the reflected position in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the background color, which is orange (7).
2.  Locate the axis of reflection: find the single, complete horizontal or vertical line within the grid that consists of a single, uniform color different from the background color. Determine if the axis is horizontal (record the row index) or vertical (record the column index).
3.  Initialize the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
4.  Iterate through every pixel in the input grid, considering its row `r`, column `c`, and color `pixel_color`.
5.  Check if the current pixel should be reflected:
    *   The `pixel_color` must not be the background color (orange, 7).
    *   The pixel's position (`r`, `c`) must not lie on the identified axis.
6.  If the pixel should be reflected:
    a. Calculate the reflected coordinates (`reflected_r`, `reflected_c`):
        *   If the axis is horizontal at `axis_r`: `reflected_r = 2 * axis_r - r`, `reflected_c = c`.
        *   If the axis is vertical at `axis_c`: `reflected_r = r`, `reflected_c = 2 * axis_c - c`.
    b. Verify that the calculated reflected coordinates (`reflected_r`, `reflected_c`) are within the bounds of the grid dimensions.
    c. If the reflected coordinates are within bounds, update the *output grid* at position (`reflected_r`, `reflected_c`) by setting its color to `pixel_color`. This overwrites whatever color was previously at that position in the output grid.
7.  Pixels that are background, on the axis, or whose reflections fall outside the grid remain unchanged from their initial copied state in the output grid.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
