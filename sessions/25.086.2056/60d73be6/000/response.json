This line acts as an axis.\n4.  **Objects:** There are other pixels (or groups of pixels) of various colors scattered on one side of the axis. These are the \"objects\" to be transformed.\n5.  **Transformation Type:** The core transformation appears to be a reflection. The objects on one side of the axis are mirrored onto the other side.\n6.  **Output Composition:** The output grid retains the original axis, the original objects, *and* includes the newly created reflected objects. The reflections overwrite the background color (orange) but do not seem to overwrite existing non-background pixels if there were any on the target side initially (though the examples primarily show reflections into the background).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the axis of symmetry:\n    *   Scan rows: Check if any row consists entirely of a single, non-background color. If found, this is the horizontal axis. Record its row index (`r_axis`) and color.\n    *   Scan columns: If no horizontal axis is found, check if any column consists entirely of a single, non-background color. If found, this is the vertical axis. Record its column index (`c_axis`) and color.\n3.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.\n4.  Check if the color of the current pixel `input[r, c]` is the background color (7) OR if it belongs to the identified axis of symmetry. If either is true, skip to the next pixel.\n5.
