These foreground pixels are scattered across different locations in the input grid.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves collecting all the scattered foreground pixels from the input and arranging them into a single, solid, horizontal line in the output grid. The background color fills the rest of the output grid.\n5.  **Line Properties:**\n    *   **Color:** The color of the line in the output is the same as the color of the scattered foreground pixels in the input.\n    *   **Length:** The length of the horizontal line corresponds exactly to the total number of foreground pixels found in the input grid.\n    *   **Position (Row):** The horizontal line in the output grid is consistently placed in the vertical middle row of the grid. If the grid has an even number of rows, the middle row closer to the top is used (integer division or floor of the center index). Specifically, the row index appears to be `floor((grid_height - 1) / 2)`.\n    *   **Position (Column):** The horizontal line is horizontally centered within the determined row. The starting column index seems to be calculated as `floor((grid_width - line_length) / 2)`.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
