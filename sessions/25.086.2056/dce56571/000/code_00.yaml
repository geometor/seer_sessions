task_description: Consolidate scattered pixels of a single foreground color into a centered horizontal line.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors.
    properties:
      - height: Integer number of rows.
      - width: Integer number of columns.
  - element: background_pixel
    description: The most frequent pixel color in the input grid, typically 'azure' (8).
  - element: foreground_pixels
    description: A collection of pixels in the input grid that are not the background color. All foreground pixels share the same color within a single example.
    properties:
      - color: The color code of the foreground pixels (e.g., 9, 3, 2).
      - count: The total number of foreground pixels.
      - locations: List of (row, column) coordinates for each foreground pixel.
  - element: output_line
    description: A solid horizontal line in the output grid composed of the foreground color.
    properties:
      - color: Same as the input foreground pixel color.
      - length: Equal to the count of input foreground pixels.
      - row_index: The vertical middle row of the grid, calculated as floor((grid_height - 1) / 2).
      - start_column_index: The starting column for the line, ensuring horizontal centering, calculated as floor((grid_width - length) / 2).

relationships:
  - relationship: Input to Output Grid Dimensions
    description: The output grid has the same height and width as the input grid.
  - relationship: Foreground Color Persistence
    description: The color of the foreground pixels in the input determines the color of the horizontal line in the output.
  - relationship: Pixel Count Conservation
    description: The total number of foreground pixels in the input determines the length of the horizontal line in the output.
  - relationship: Line Placement Rule
    description: The horizontal line is always placed in the vertical center row and horizontally centered based on grid dimensions and line length.

actions:
  - action: Identify Background and Foreground
    description: Determine the background color and locate all pixels of the single foreground color.
  - action: Count Foreground Pixels
    description: Calculate the total number of foreground pixels.
  - action: Determine Output Grid Dimensions
    description: Use the dimensions of the input grid for the output grid.
  - action: Calculate Line Position
    description: Compute the target row index (vertical center) and starting column index (horizontal center).
  - action: Construct Output Grid
    description: Create a new grid filled with the background color.
  - action: Draw Line
    description: Place the calculated horizontal line onto the output grid at the determined position.
