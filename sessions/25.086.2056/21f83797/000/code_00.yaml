Input Grid:
  - dimensions: variable (e.g., 13x13 in examples)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      - type: pixel
      - count: 2
      - color: red (2)
      - properties: position (row, column)

Output Grid:
  - dimensions: same as input
  - background_color: white (0)
  - elements:
      - horizontal_lines:
          - count: 2
          - color: red (2)
          - position: rows corresponding to the input red pixels
          - extent: full width of the grid
      - vertical_lines:
          - count: 2
          - color: red (2)
          - position: columns corresponding to the input red pixels
          - extent: full height of the grid
      - inner_rectangle:
          - color: blue (1)
          - position: area strictly bounded by the horizontal and vertical lines
          - excluded_pixels: the lines themselves

Transformation:
  - identify_pixels: Find the coordinates (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) of the two non-background (red) pixels in the input grid.
  - determine_bounds: Calculate the minimum and maximum row indices (min_r, max_r) and column indices (min_c, max_c) from the two pixel coordinates.
  - draw_frame:
      - Draw a horizontal red line across the grid at row = min_r.
      - Draw a horizontal red line across the grid at row = max_r.
      - Draw a vertical red line across the grid at col = min_c.
      - Draw a vertical red line across the grid at col = max_c.
  - fill_interior: Fill all pixels (r, c) such that min_r < r < max_r and min_c < c < max_c with blue (1).
  - maintain_background: Pixels not part of the frame or the filled interior remain white (0).
