**Perception**

The input grids consist primarily of a white background (0) and contain exactly two pixels of another color, red (2) in the provided examples. The task is to transform the input grid based on the positions of these two red pixels.

The output grid retains the same dimensions as the input. The transformation involves projecting horizontal and vertical lines from the locations of the two initial red pixels. These lines extend across the entire grid and use the same color as the input pixels (red). This creates a rectangular frame defined by the rows and columns of the input pixels. The area strictly *inside* this rectangular frame (excluding the frame lines themselves) is then filled with a different color, blue (1). The pixels on the frame lines remain red, including the intersection points. All pixels outside the frame remain the original background color (white).

**Facts**


```yaml
Input Grid:
  - dimensions: variable (e.g., 13x13 in examples)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      - type: pixel
      - count: 2
      - color: red (2)
      - properties: position (row, column)

Output Grid:
  - dimensions: same as input
  - background_color: white (0)
  - elements:
      - horizontal_lines:
          - count: 2
          - color: red (2)
          - position: rows corresponding to the input red pixels
          - extent: full width of the grid
      - vertical_lines:
          - count: 2
          - color: red (2)
          - position: columns corresponding to the input red pixels
          - extent: full height of the grid
      - inner_rectangle:
          - color: blue (1)
          - position: area strictly bounded by the horizontal and vertical lines
          - excluded_pixels: the lines themselves

Transformation:
  - identify_pixels: Find the coordinates (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) of the two non-background (red) pixels in the input grid.
  - determine_bounds: Calculate the minimum and maximum row indices (min_r, max_r) and column indices (min_c, max_c) from the two pixel coordinates.
  - draw_frame:
      - Draw a horizontal red line across the grid at row = min_r.
      - Draw a horizontal red line across the grid at row = max_r.
      - Draw a vertical red line across the grid at col = min_c.
      - Draw a vertical red line across the grid at col = max_c.
  - fill_interior: Fill all pixels (r, c) such that min_r < r < max_r and min_c < c < max_c with blue (1).
  - maintain_background: Pixels not part of the frame or the filled interior remain white (0).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, or as a grid of the same dimensions filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the coordinates (row1, col1) and (row2, col2) of the two non-background pixels (color red, 2) in the input grid.
3.  Determine the minimum row (`min_row`), maximum row (`max_row`), minimum column (`min_col`), and maximum column (`max_col`) from these two coordinates.
4.  Iterate through all columns from 0 to width-1:
    *   Set the pixel at (`min_row`, column) in the output grid to red (2).
    *   Set the pixel at (`max_row`, column) in the output grid to red (2).
5.  Iterate through all rows from 0 to height-1:
    *   Set the pixel at (row, `min_col`) in the output grid to red (2).
    *   Set the pixel at (row, `max_col`) in the output grid to red (2).
6.  Iterate through all rows `r` from `min_row + 1` to `max_row - 1`:
    *   Iterate through all columns `c` from `min_col + 1` to `max_col - 1`:
        *   Set the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to blue (1).
7.  Return the final output grid.
