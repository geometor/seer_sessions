The task is to transform the input grid based on the positions of these two red pixels.\n\nThe output grid retains the same dimensions as the input. The transformation involves projecting horizontal and vertical lines from the locations of the two initial red pixels. These lines extend across the entire grid and use the same color as the input pixels (red). This creates a rectangular frame defined by the rows and columns of the input pixels. The area strictly *inside* this rectangular frame (excluding the frame lines themselves) is then filled with a different color, blue (1). The pixels on the frame lines remain red, including the intersection points. All pixels outside the frame remain the original background color (white).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
