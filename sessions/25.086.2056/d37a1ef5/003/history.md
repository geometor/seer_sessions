**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided Python code attempts to solve the task by identifying a red rectangular frame and filling all white pixels within its interior with red. However, the results show that this approach is too simplistic. In all three examples, the code incorrectly changes some white pixels inside the frame to red when they should have remained white according to the expected output.

The key difference between the transformed output and the expected output lies in the treatment of white pixels near gray pixels within the frame's interior. The original code fills *all* interior white pixels, while the correct transformation selectively leaves some white pixels untouched.

The strategy is to refine the transformation rule by analyzing the relationship between the gray pixels and the white pixels that remain white. The hypothesis is that the gray pixels act as "blockers" or "obstacles" that prevent the red "fill" from reaching certain white pixels. The fill likely propagates inwards from the frame edges and stops when it encounters a gray pixel along its path. We need to precisely define how this blocking mechanism works.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's analyze the interiors defined by the red frames and the counts of relevant pixels for each example. The interior is the region strictly between the minimum and maximum row/column of the red pixels.

Example 1:
*   Input Size: 12x11
*   Frame: rows 1-8, cols 1-8
*   Interior: rows 2-7, cols 2-7
*   Gray pixels in interior: 2 (at (4, 3) and (5, 4))
*   White pixels in interior (Input): 34
*   White pixels changed to red (Expected Output): 32
*   White pixels remaining white (Expected Output): 2 (at (4, 4) and (5, 3)) - Notice these are adjacent to the gray pixels.
*   Code Incorrectly Changed: 2 (at (4, 4) and (5, 3))

Example 2:
*   Input Size: 8x11
*   Frame: rows 1-6, cols 1-8
*   Interior: rows 2-5, cols 2-7
*   Gray pixels in interior: 3 (at (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 5))
*   White pixels in interior (Input): 21
*   White pixels changed to red (Expected Output): 16
*   White pixels remaining white (Expected Output): 5 (at (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6))
*   Code Incorrectly Changed: 5

Example 3:
*   Input Size: 12x12
*   Frame: rows 1-8, cols 1-10
*   Interior: rows 2-7, cols 2-9
*   Gray pixels in interior: 4 (at (4, 4), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 7))
*   White pixels in interior (Input): 44
*   White pixels changed to red (Expected Output): 36
*   White pixels remaining white (Expected Output): 8 (at (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6))
*   Code Incorrectly Changed: 8

Observations from metrics:
*   The number of white pixels incorrectly changed by the code matches the number of white pixels that should have remained white in the expected output.
*   These remaining white pixels consistently appear adjacent to or "behind" gray pixels relative to the nearest frame edge.

    description: |
      Simulate filling the interior region with red (2) starting from each of the four sides of the frame.
      The fill propagates inwards (horizontally from left/right edges, vertically from top/bottom edges).
      For each path (row or column) starting from an edge, the fill converts white (0) pixels to red (2).
      The fill stops along a path if it encounters a gray (5) obstacle or the opposite frame boundary.
      A white pixel is changed to red only if it can be reached by the fill from at least one of the four directions without being blocked by a gray obstacle.
      Gray pixels and pixels outside the interior remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Frame:** Locate all red (2) pixels in the input grid. Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by these red pixels. These define the outer boundaries of the frame.
2.  **Define the Interior:** Identify the rectangular region strictly *inside* the frame boundaries (i.e., excluding the frame pixels themselves). The interior spans from `min_row + 1` to `max_row - 1` (inclusive) and `min_col + 1` to `max_col - 1` (inclusive).
3.  **Identify Obstacles:** Locate all gray (5) pixels within this interior region.
4.  **Perform Directional Fill:**
    *   Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    *   Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` within the interior region.
    *   If the pixel `(r, c)` in the input grid is white (0), determine if it should be changed to red (2) based on the following reachability checks:
        *   **Check Left:** Scan horizontally from the left boundary (`min_col + 1`) towards `c` along row `r`. If no gray (5) pixel is encountered *before* reaching column `c`, the pixel is reachable from the left.
        *   **Check Right:** Scan horizontally from the right boundary (`max_col - 1`) towards `c` along row `r`. If no gray (5) pixel is encountered *before* reaching column `c`, the pixel is reachable from the right.
        *   **Check Top:** Scan vertically from the top boundary (`min_row + 1`) towards `r` along column `c`. If no gray (5) pixel is encountered *before* reaching row `r`, the pixel is reachable from the top.
        *   **Check Bottom:** Scan vertically from the bottom boundary (`max_row - 1`) towards `r` along column `c`. If no gray (5) pixel is encountered *before* reaching row `r`, the pixel is reachable from the bottom.
    *   If the white pixel `(r, c)` is reachable from *at least one* of the four directions (left, right, top, bottom) without being blocked by a gray obstacle along that path within the interior, change its color to red (2) in the output grid.
    *   If a white pixel is not reachable from any direction (meaning all paths from the frame edges are blocked by gray pixels), it remains white (0).
5.  **Maintain Other Pixels:** All pixels originally part of the frame (red), outside the frame, or non-white pixels inside the frame (like the gray obstacles) remain unchanged in the output grid.
6.  **Return:** Return the modified output grid.
