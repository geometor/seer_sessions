The code execution confirms the pixel counts and locations identified manually. The pattern is consistent: the current code fills white pixels that, in the expected output, remain white because they are "behind" gray obstacles relative to the frame boundary, even if they have a clear path in another direction. This strongly supports the flood-fill hypothesis.**General Assessment**

The provided code attempts to fill the interior of a red rectangular frame based on reachability from the boundary, avoiding gray obstacles. However, the results show that the code incorrectly fills some white pixels in all three training examples. The `transformed_output` consistently contains more red pixels within the frame's interior than the `expected_output`.

The core issue appears to be the definition of "reachability". The current implementation checks if a white pixel has an unobstructed *line-of-sight* path (horizontally or vertically) to *any* of the four interior boundaries. The expected outputs suggest a more constrained reachability, akin to a flood fill or connected components analysis *starting* from the inner boundary. White pixels are only filled if they are part of a contiguous white area connected to the frame's inner edge, where gray pixels act as barriers to this connection.

The strategy will be to refine the understanding of the fill process, moving from the independent line-of-sight checks to a connected components/flood fill approach originating from the boundary.

**Metrics and Analysis**

| Example | Input Size  | Output Size | Pixels Off | Off Pixel Coords (Row, Col)         | Analysis                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :------ | :---------- | :---------- | :--------- | :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | 12x11       | 12x11       | 2          | `(4, 4)`, `(5, 3)`                  | The pixels at `(4, 4)` and `(5, 3)` are white (0) in the expected output but red (2) in the transformed output. Both are 'behind' gray pixels `(4, 3)` and `(5, 4)` relative to some boundaries.         |
| 2       | 8x11        | 8x11        | 5          | `(3, 4)`, `(3, 5)`, `(4, 3)`, `(4, 4)`, `(4, 6)` | Similar pattern. These pixels are white (0) in expected, red (2) in transformed. They form areas partially enclosed or blocked by gray pixels `(3, 3)`, `(3, 6)`, `(4, 5)`. |
| 3       | 12x12       | 12x12       | 8          | `(4, 5)`, `(4, 6)`, `(4, 7)`, `(5, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, `(5, 7)`, `(6, 5)`, `(6, 6)` | Again, white (0) pixels in expected are red (2) in transformed. These pixels are in regions separated from parts of the boundary by gray pixels.                                        |

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The errors consistently occur at white pixels that are topologically separated from at least one section of the inner frame boundary by gray pixels. The current code fills them if *any* path is clear, while the correct logic requires the pixel to be reachable via a path of *only* white pixels originating from the boundary.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Frame:** Locate the smallest bounding box encompassing all red (2) pixels. This defines the frame. If no red pixels exist, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  **Define the Interior:** Determine the region of pixels strictly inside the frame (i.e., excluding the frame pixels themselves). If the frame is too thin to have an interior (less than 3x3), return the input grid unchanged.
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the input grid to store the results.
4.  **Identify Seeds:** Find all white (0) pixels within the interior region that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a red (2) pixel belonging to the frame. These are the starting points ('seeds') for the fill.
5.  **Perform Flood Fill:**
    *   Maintain a queue or stack initialized with the seed pixels identified in step 4.
    *   Maintain a set of visited white pixels within the interior, initially containing the seeds.
    *   While the queue/stack is not empty:
        *   Dequeue/pop a pixel coordinate `(r, c)`.
        *   Change the color of this pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid to red (2).
        *   Examine its four neighbors (up, down, left, right).
        *   For each neighbor `(nr, nc)`:
            *   Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the interior boundaries.
            *   Check if the pixel `(nr, nc)` in the *input* grid is white (0).
            *   Check if `(nr, nc)` has not already been visited.
            *   If all conditions are met, add `(nr, nc)` to the visited set and enqueue/push it.
6.  **Return Output:** Return the modified grid. All interior white pixels connected to the frame boundary via a path of white pixels (unblocked by gray pixels) will now be red. Other pixels (frame, outside, gray obstacles, disconnected white pixels) remain unchanged.
