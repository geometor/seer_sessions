Identifies a rectangular frame made of red (2) pixels.
Determines the region strictly inside this frame (the interior).
Performs a flood fill starting from white (0) pixels within the interior that are adjacent to the red frame boundary.
The fill propagates only through other white (0) pixels within the interior, using 4-directional adjacency.
Gray (5) pixels (and any other non-white pixels) within the interior act as barriers, stopping the flood fill.
All white pixels reached by the flood fill are changed to red (2).

Okay, the simple post-processing idea (revert red if adjacent to original gray) doesn't work. It fixed some errors but created others or failed to fix existing ones (like `(4, 7)` in Ex 3). It reverted pixels like `(3, 4)` which *should* have stayed red.

Let's reconsider the "barrier" concept. Maybe the initial flood fill *itself* needs to be modified.
The standard flood fill explores neighbors `(nr, nc)` and adds them to the queue if they are within bounds, are the target color (White), and haven't been visited.

What if the condition is stricter? Add `(nr, nc)` to queue IF:
1.  Within interior bounds.
2.  Is White in the *original* grid.
3.  Not visited.
4.  AND `(nr, nc)` is NOT adjacent (cardinally) to an interior Gray pixel.

Let's try this modified flood fill logic.
*   **Setup**: Identify interior bounds, interior grays. Pre-calculate the set of "forbidden" white pixels (those adjacent to interior grays). `Forbidden = { (r, c) | grid[r, c] == WHITE and is_interior(r, c) and has_interior_gray_neighbor(r, c) }`.
*   **Seeds**: Identify interior white pixels adjacent to the red frame. Add valid seeds (those not in `Forbidden`) to the queue and visited set.
*   **Fill**:
    *   Dequeue `(r, c)`.
    *   Color `output_grid[r, c] = RED`.
    *   Explore neighbors `(nr, nc)`.
    *   If neighbor `(nr, nc)` is:
        *   Within interior bounds
        *   White in original grid
        *   Not visited
        *   AND `(nr, nc)` is NOT in `Forbidden` set.
    *   Then add `(nr, nc)` to queue and visited set.

Let's trace Example 1 with this:
*   Interior Grays: `{(4, 4), (5, 5)}`.
*   Forbidden Whites: `{(3, 4), (5, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), (6, 5), (5, 6)}`.
*   Seeds: Interior whites adjacent to frame. E.g., `(2, 2)` to `(2, 8)`, `(8, 2)` to `(8, 8)`, etc. Check if any seed is Forbidden. `(2, 4)` is not forbidden. `(3, 3)` is not forbidden. `(4, 2)` is not forbidden. `(4, 3)` *is* forbidden. `(5, 2)` is not forbidden. `(5, 3)` is not forbidden. `(6, 2)` is not forbidden. `(6, 4)` is not forbidden. `(7, 4)` is not forbidden. `(8, 4)` is not forbidden. ... `(4, 8)` is not forbidden. `(5, 8)` is not forbidden. `(6, 8)` is not forbidden. `(7, 8)` is not forbidden.
*   Fill starts from non-forbidden seeds.
*   Consider pixel `(4, 5)`. It is Forbidden. It will never be added to the queue. It remains White.
*   Consider pixel `(5, 4)`. It is Forbidden. It will never be added to the queue. It remains White.
*   All other reachable interior white pixels that are not Forbidden will be filled Red.
*   This seems to match Example 1's expected output.

Let's trace Example 2 with this:
*   Interior Grays: `{(3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6)}`.
*   Forbidden Whites: `{(2, 4), (4, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (2, 7), (4, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (6, 6), (5, 5), (5, 7)}`.
*   Expected white pixels in output (besides grays): `(4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 7)`.
*   Check if these are in the Forbidden set:
    *   `(4, 4)`: Yes. Remains White. Correct.
    *   `(4, 5)`: Yes. Remains White. Correct.
    *   `(5, 4)`: No. This pixel is *not* forbidden by this rule. It would be filled Red. Incorrect.
    *   `(5, 5)`: Yes. Remains White. Correct.
    *   `(5, 7)`: Yes. Remains White. Correct.
*   This logic *still* fails for `(5, 4)` in Example 2.

Why should `(5, 4)` remain white?
Input Ex 2:

```
...
2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2  (row 2)
2 0[G]0 0[G]0 0 2  (row 3)
2 0[W]0[W]G 0[W]2  (row 4) <- W at (4,4), (4,5), (4,7)
2 0 W[W]0[W]G[W]2  (row 5) <- W at (5,4), (5,5), (5,7)
2 0 0 0 0[W]0 0 2  (row 6) <- W at (6,6)
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2  (row 7)
...
```

Expected Output Ex 2:

```
...
2 R R R R R R R 2
2 R R[G]R R[G]R R 2
2 R R[W]R[W]G R[W]2  <- (4,4), (4,5), (4,7) are White
2 R R[W]W R[W]G[W]2  <- (5,4), (5,5), (5,7) are White
2 R R R R R[W]R R 2  <- (6,6) is White
2 R R R R R R R R 2
...
```

The white pixels that remain white in the output are exactly those identified previously as `Forbidden` (adjacent to gray), *plus* `(5, 4)`.

What is special about `(5, 4)`?
Its neighbours are `(4, 4)`, `(6, 4)`, `(5, 3)`, `(5, 5)`.
In the input, these are White, White, White, White.
In the *expected output*, these are White, Red, Red, White.
So, `(5, 4)` is adjacent to `(4, 4)` (White output) and `(5, 5)` (White output).

Maybe the rule is:
1. Identify interior gray pixels `G`.
2. Identify interior white pixels `W_adj` that are cardinally adjacent to any pixel in `G`.
3. Identify interior white pixels `W_adj2` that are cardinally adjacent to any pixel in `W_adj`.
4. The set of pixels that remain white is `G U W_adj U W_adj2`.
5. All other interior white pixels are filled Red. (Effectively, perform a flood fill, but only fill pixels *not* in `G U W_adj U W_adj2`).

Let's re-test this "2-layer adjacency" idea.
*   Example 1:
    *   `G = {(4, 4), (5, 5)}`
    *   `W_adj = {(3, 4), (5, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), (6, 5), (5, 6)}`
    *   `W_adj2 = {(2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (6, 4), (5, 3), (4, 2), (4, 6), (7, 5), (6, 6), (5, 7)}` (calculated previously)
    *   Set of white pixels = `G U W_adj U W_adj2`. Total = 2 + 6 + 10 = 18 interior pixels remain white/gray.
    *   Expected output has only `G` and `W_adj_subset = {(4, 5), (5, 4)}` remaining white/gray. Total = 2 + 2 = 4.
    *   This rule makes far too many pixels white for Example 1.

Let's scrap the multi-layer adjacency.

What if it's about connected components?
*   Identify the red frame.
*   Identify the interior region.
*   Within the interior, consider gray pixels as permanent barriers.
*   Consider the white pixels. Find connected components of white pixels (using 4-way adjacency).
*   For each white component, check if it is adjacent (touches) the red frame boundary.
*   If a white component touches the frame boundary, fill it entirely with red, UNLESS it also touches an interior gray pixel.

Let's try this "Component" based approach:
*   **Algorithm**:
    1. Find red frame and interior bounds.
    2. Find all interior gray pixels `G`.
    3. Find all connected components of interior white pixels `W_comp_1, W_comp_2, ...`. Use 4-way adjacency.
    4. Initialize output grid as input grid copy.
    5. For each white component `W_comp_i`:
        a. Check if any pixel in `W_comp_i` is adjacent (4-way) to the red frame boundary. `TouchesFrame = True/False`.
        b. Check if any pixel in `W_comp_i` is adjacent (4-way) to any pixel in `G`. `TouchesGray = True/False`.
        c. If `TouchesFrame` is True AND `TouchesGray` is False:
            Fill all pixels in `W_comp_i` with Red in the output grid.
*   **Example 1**:
    *   Interior: rows 2-8, cols 2-8.
    *   `G = {(4, 4), (5, 5)}`.
    *   White pixels: Large connected area, except for the two grays. Let's analyze connectivity near the grays. `(4, 5)` is white, adjacent to `(4, 4)`. `(5, 4)` is white, adjacent to `(5, 5)`. Are `(4, 5)` and `(5, 4)` part of the main white component? Yes, e.g. `(4, 5) -> (3, 5) -> ... -> Frame`. `(5, 4) -> (5, 3) -> ... -> Frame`.
    *   It seems there is only ONE large component of white pixels in the interior.
    *   Check Component 1:
        *   Touches Frame? Yes (e.g., `(2, 2)` is in it and touches frame at `(1, 2)` or `(2, 1)` - wait, adjacency to frame is defined differently. Adjacency means interior pixel `(r, c)` touches frame pixel `(r-1, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r, c-1)`, or `(r, c+1)`). Yes, e.g., `(2, 2)` touches `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)`.
        *   Touches Gray? Yes, `(4, 5)` in the component touches `(4, 4)` in G. Also `(5, 4)` touches `(5, 5)`.
        *   Condition `TouchesFrame` is True, `TouchesGray` is True. Fill condition (`TouchesFrame` AND NOT `TouchesGray`) is False.
    *   Result: No pixels are filled Red. This is incorrect.

Maybe the fill rule is simpler? Fill component if it touches the frame?
*   Revised Algorithm 2:
    1. Find frame, interior, `G`.
    2. Find white components `W_comp_i`.
    3. For each `W_comp_i`:
        a. Check `TouchesFrame`.
        b. If `TouchesFrame` is True: Fill `W_comp_i` with Red.
*   Example 1:
    *   One white component. `TouchesFrame` is True. Fill it all Red.
    *   Output: All interior white pixels become Red. Grays remain Gray.
    *   This matches the original erroneous `transformed_output` for Ex 1, Ex 2, Ex 3. This is not correct.

Let's reconsider the failed post-processing idea.
Original Code Output (Flood fill from frame, stopped by non-white):
Ex 1: Fails at `(5, 4)`(W->R), `(4, 5)`(W->R). Should be W. Adjacent to Gray.
Ex 2: Fails at `(4, 4)`(W->R), `(4, 5)`(W->R), `(5, 4)`(W->R), `(5, 5)`(W->R), `(5, 7)`(W->R). Should be W. All except `(5, 4)` are adjacent to Gray.
Ex 3: Fails at `(4, 5)`(W->R), `(4, 6)`(W->R), `(4, 7)`(W->R), `(5, 4)`(W->R), `(5, 5)`(W->R), `(5, 7)`(W->R), `(6, 5)`(W->R), `(6, 6)`(W->R). Should be W. Let's check adjacency to Gray `{(4, 4), (6, 7), (6, 4), (5, 6)}`.
    * `(4, 5)`: Adj to `(4, 4)`. Should revert.
    * `(4, 6)`: Adj to `(5, 6)`. Should revert.
    * `(4, 7)`: Not adj to gray. Stays R? Expected W. Fail.
    * `(5, 4)`: Adj to `(4, 4)`, `(6, 4)`. Should revert.
    * `(5, 5)`: Adj to `(5, 6)`. Should revert.
    * `(5, 7)`: Adj to `(5, 6)`. Should revert.
    * `(6, 5)`: Adj to `(6, 4)`, `(5, 6)`. Should revert.
    * `(6, 6)`: Adj to `(5, 6)`, `(6, 7)`. Should revert.
If we apply the "revert if adj to gray" post-processing, the pixels reverted would be: `(4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 7), (6, 5), (6, 6)`.
The pixel `(4, 7)` would remain Red. But the expected output has `(4, 7)` as White.

What is special about `(4, 7)` in Ex 3? Neighbours: `(3, 7)`(W), `(5, 7)`(W), `(4, 6)`(W), `(4, 8)`(W).
Original Grays: `(4, 4), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 7)`.
Expected output has `(4, 5)=W, (4, 6)=W, (4, 7)=W, (5, 4)=W, (5, 5)=W, (5, 7)=W, (6, 5)=W, (6, 6)=W`.
Maybe the definition of "interior" for the gray pixels is wrong? Does the frame count? No, the description says "strictly inside".

What if the flood fill starts somewhere else? Not from the frame border?
No, the examples strongly suggest a fill bounded by the red frame.

Let's reconsider the rule: "Fill white pixels reachable from the frame boundary, unless the path is blocked by gray". The adjacency rule is key.

Maybe the gray pixels project "blockage" onto adjacent white squares?
Imagine the grid. Mark Gray squares `G`. Mark White squares adjacent to `G` squares as `W'`.
Perform flood fill from frame boundary, but treat both `G` and `W'` squares as barriers (cannot enter them).

*   **Algorithm 3**:
    1. Find frame, interior bounds.
    2. Identify interior `G` cells (Gray).
    3. Identify interior `W'` cells (White, cardinally adjacent to an interior `G` cell).
    4. Initialize output grid = input grid.
    5. Initialize queue with seed pixels: interior White cells adjacent to the frame boundary, *unless* they are in `W'`.
    6. Initialize visited set = {seed pixels}.
    7. While queue not empty:
        a. Dequeue `(r, c)`.
        b. Set `output_grid[r, c] = RED`.
        c. For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)`:
            i. If `(nr, nc)` is within interior bounds AND
            ii. `input_grid[nr, nc]` is White AND
            iii. `(nr, nc)` is not visited AND
            iv. `(nr, nc)` is NOT in `G` (implicit by ii) AND
            v. `(nr, nc)` is NOT in `W'`.
            vi. Add `(nr, nc)` to queue and visited set.
*   **Example 1**:
    *   `G = {(4, 4), (5, 5)}`.
    *   `W' = {(3, 4), (5, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), (6, 5), (5, 6)}`.
    *   Seeds: Interior White adjacent to frame. Remove those in `W'`. E.g. `(4, 3)` is adjacent to frame and in `W'`, so it's not a seed. `(3, 4)` is adj to frame and in `W'`, not a seed. `(4, 5)` is not adj to frame. `(5, 4)` is not adj to frame. `(5, 6)` is not adj to frame. `(6, 5)` is not adj to frame. Seeds like `(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), ...` are valid.
    *   Fill proceeds. It cannot enter any cell in `G` or `W'`.
    *   The cells that remain white will be `G U W'`.
    *   Expected white cells (besides G): `(4, 5), (5, 4)`.
    *   Our `W'` contains `(4, 5)` and `(5, 4)`, but also others like `(3, 4), (4, 3), (6, 5), (5, 6)`.
    *   This algorithm predicts `(3, 4), (4, 3), (6, 5), (5, 6)` will also remain white, which is incorrect for Example 1.

It seems my understanding of how the gray pixels interact is flawed. Let's look at the SUCCESSFUL outputs.
Ex 1 Expected: Only `(4, 5)` and `(5, 4)` remain white. They are adjacent to `(4, 4)`(G) and `(5, 5)`(G) respectively.
Ex 2 Expected: `(4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 7)` remain white.
    *   `(4, 4)` adj to `(3, 4)`(G)
    *   `(4, 5)` adj to `(4, 6)`(G)
    *   `(5, 4)` adj to ???
    *   `(5, 5)` adj to `(5, 6)`(G)
    *   `(5, 7)` adj to `(5, 6)`(G)
Ex 3 Expected: `(4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 7), (6, 5), (6, 6)` remain white.
    *   `(4, 5)` adj to `(4, 4)`(G)
    *   `(4, 6)` adj to `(5, 6)`(G)
    *   `(4, 7)` adj to ???
    *   `(5, 4)` adj to `(4, 4)`(G), `(6, 4)`(G)
    *   `(5, 5)` adj to `(5, 6)`(G)
    *   `(5, 7)` adj to `(5, 6)`(G), `(6, 7)`(G)
    *   `(6, 5)` adj to `(6, 4)`(G), `(5, 6)`(G)
    *   `(6, 6)` adj to `(5, 6)`(G), `(6, 7)`(G)

The pixels that remain white are ALMOST exactly the set of interior white pixels adjacent to interior gray pixels. The exceptions are `(5, 4)` in Ex 2 and `(4, 7)` in Ex 3. Why do *these* remain white?

Look at the neighbours of the exceptions in the *expected* output grid:
*   Ex 2, `(5, 4)`(W): Neighbours `(4, 4)`(W), `(6, 4)`(R), `(5, 3)`(R), `(5, 5)`(W). It's adjacent to other white pixels that *are* adjacent to grays.
*   Ex 3, `(4, 7)`(W): Neighbours `(3, 7)`(R), `(5, 7)`(W), `(4, 6)`(W), `(4, 8)`(R). It's adjacent to other white pixels that *are* adjacent to grays.

Hypothesis: The set of pixels that remain white (`W_final`) is the union of interior Grays (`G`) and a subset of interior Whites (`W_keep`). `W_keep` contains an interior White pixel `p` if:
   a) `p` is cardinally adjacent to a pixel in `G`.
   OR
   b) `p` is cardinally adjacent to another White pixel `q` where `q` satisfies condition (a).

Let's test this:
*   Set `W_adj` = {interior White `p` | `p` is cardinally adjacent to some `g` in `G`}.
*   Set `W_adj2` = {interior White `p` | `p` is cardinally adjacent to some `q` in `W_adj`, AND `p` is not in `W_adj`}.
*   `W_keep = W_adj U W_adj2`.
*   Fill = All interior White pixels NOT in `W_keep`.

*   **Example 1**:
    *   `G = {(4, 4), (5, 5)}`
    *   `W_adj = {(3, 4), (5, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), (6, 5), (5, 6)}`
    *   `W_adj2` = (calculated before) `{ (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (6, 4), (5, 3), (4, 2), (4, 6), (7, 5), (6, 6), (5, 7) }` (Ensure these are interior and White in input - yes).
    *   `W_keep` = `W_adj U W_adj2`. This contains 16 white pixels.
    *   Expected output only keeps `(4, 5)` and `(5, 4)` white (from `W_adj`). This hypothesis still keeps too many pixels white.

Let's simplify. Maybe the rule IS just "Keep white if adjacent to gray", and the exceptions `(5, 4)` in Ex 2 and `(4, 7)` in Ex 3 are errors in my analysis or the problem statement/expected output? Let's re-verify adjacency.

*   Ex 2: `(5, 4)`. Neighbors `(4, 4), (6, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5)`. Interior Grays `{(3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6)}`. No direct adjacency.
*   Ex 3: `(4, 7)`. Neighbors `(3, 7), (5, 7), (4, 6), (4, 8)`. Interior Grays `{(4, 4), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 7)}`. No direct adjacency.

This confirms these two pixels are not directly adjacent to interior grays. Why do they stay white?

Could it be diagonal adjacency?
*   Ex 2: `(5, 4)`. Diagonal neighbors `(4, 3), (4, 5), (6, 3), (6, 5)`. None are gray.
*   Ex 3: `(4, 7)`. Diagonal neighbors `(3, 6), (3, 8), (5, 6), (5, 8)`. `(5, 6)` is Gray!

Okay, let's revise:
Hypothesis: An interior White pixel remains White if it is adjacent (8-way, including diagonals) to an interior Gray pixel. All other interior White pixels reachable by flood fill from the frame boundary become Red.

*   **Algorithm 4**:
    1. Find frame, interior bounds.
    2. Identify interior `G` cells (Gray).
    3. Identify interior `W_keep` cells (White, 8-way adjacent to an interior `G` cell).
    4. Initialize output grid = input grid.
    5. Initialize queue with seed pixels: interior White cells adjacent (4-way) to the frame boundary, *unless* they are in `W_keep`.
    6. Initialize visited set = {seed pixels}. Mark all cells in `W_keep` as visited too, so the fill doesn't enter them.
    7. While queue not empty:
        a. Dequeue `(r, c)`.
        b. Set `output_grid[r, c] = RED`.
        c. For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)` (using 4-way adjacency for fill propagation):
            i. If `(nr, nc)` is within interior bounds AND
            ii. `input_grid[nr, nc]` is White AND
            iii. `(nr, nc)` is not visited:
            iv. Add `(nr, nc)` to queue and visited set.
*   **Example 1**:
    *   `G = {(4, 4), (5, 5)}`.
    *   `W_keep` (8-way adj):
        *   Adj to `(4, 4)`: `(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)(G)`. Interior Whites: `{(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4)}`.
        *   Adj to `(5, 5)`: `(4, 4)(G), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)`. Interior Whites: `{(4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)}`.
        *   Union `W_keep = {(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)}`. (12 pixels)
    *   Expected output keeps only `(4, 5)` and `(5, 4)` white. This hypothesis still keeps too many white.

Maybe the flood fill itself uses 8-way adjacency?
Maybe the adjacency check for "keep white" uses 4-way, and the exceptions are anomalies?

Let's re-run the calculation for the simple post-processing idea ("Fill all reachable white, then revert red if 4-way adjacent to original interior gray") on Ex 3, double-checking the `tool_code` output.

*   `transformed_3` (output of initial flood fill) has errors at `(4, 5..7), (5, 4..5), (5, 7), (6, 5..6)`. These are Red, expected White.
*   Interior Grays: `{(4, 4), (6, 7), (6, 4), (5, 6)}`.
*   Pixels reverted by post-processing code: `[(3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 7), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 8), (7, 4), (7, 7)]`.
*   Let's manually check which of the error pixels should be reverted:
    *   `(4, 5)`: Adj to `(4, 4)`(G). Revert. (Correct)
    *   `(4, 6)`: Adj to `(5, 6)`(G). Revert. (Correct)
    *   `(4, 7)`: Neighbors `(3, 7), (5, 7), (4, 6), (4, 8)`. None are G. Don't revert. (Error remains)
    *   `(5, 4)`: Adj to `(4, 4)`(G), `(6, 4)`(G). Revert. (Correct)
    *   `(5, 5)`: Adj to `(5, 6)`(G). Revert. (Correct)
    *   `(5, 7)`: Adj to `(5, 6)`(G), `(6, 7)`(G). Revert. (Correct)
    *   `(6, 5)`: Adj to `(6, 4)`(G), `(5, 6)`(G). Revert. (Correct)
    *   `(6, 6)`: Adj to `(5, 6)`(G), `(6, 7)`(G). Revert. (Correct)
*   So, this post-processing rule correctly identifies all pixels that should remain white *except* for `(4, 7)` in Ex 3 and `(5, 4)` in Ex 2.

What if the post-processing uses 8-way adjacency?
*   **Algorithm 5**:
    1. Perform standard 4-way flood fill from frame boundary through interior white pixels, changing them to Red. Grays act as barriers.
    2. Post-process: Iterate through all interior cells `(r, c)`. If `output_grid[r, c]` is Red AND `(r, c)` is 8-way adjacent to an *original* interior Gray cell, change `output_grid[r, c]` back to White.
*   **Example 1**:
    *   Fill: `(4, 5)` and `(5, 4)` become Red.
    *   Post-process (8-way): Check red pixels.
        *   `(3, 3)`: Diag adj to `(4, 4)`(G). Revert.
        *   `(3, 4)`: Adj to `(4, 4)`(G). Revert.
        *   `(3, 5)`: Diag adj to `(4, 4)`(G). Revert.
        *   `(4, 3)`: Adj to `(4, 4)`(G). Revert.
        *   `(4, 5)`: Adj to `(4, 4)`(G), Diag adj to `(5, 5)`(G). Revert. (Correct)
        *   `(5, 3)`: Diag adj to `(4, 4)`(G). Revert.
        *   `(5, 4)`: Adj to `(4, 4)`(G), Diag adj to `(5, 5)`(G). Revert. (Correct)
        *   ... many others revert. This reverts too many.

Let's go back to the two exceptions: `(5, 4)` in Ex 2 and `(4, 7)` in Ex 3. They remain white, but are not 4-way adjacent to an interior gray. They *are* 4-way adjacent to other white pixels which *are* 4-way adjacent to gray.

Could the rule be:
1. Perform standard 4-way flood fill from frame boundary through interior white pixels, changing them to Red.
2. Identify the set `W_adj` = {interior White `p` | `p` is 4-way adjacent to an interior Gray `g`}.
3. The final set of white pixels in the interior is `G U W_adj`. Update the output grid accordingly. (Essentially, ignore the flood fill result for pixels in `W_adj`).

*   **Algorithm 6**:
    1. Find frame, interior bounds `I`.
    2. Identify interior Grays `G`.
    3. Identify `W_adj` = { `(r, c)` in `I` | `input_grid[r, c] == WHITE` and `(r, c)` is 4-way adjacent to some `g` in `G` }.
    4. Create output grid, copy of input.
    5. Perform standard 4-way flood fill starting from seeds (interior White adjacent to frame). The fill can propagate through any interior White pixel. Let the set of filled pixels be `F`.
    6. For each pixel `(r, c)` in the interior `I`:
        a. If `(r, c)` is in `G`, `output_grid[r, c]` remains Gray
