Each grid contains a rectangular frame made of `red` (2) pixels. Inside this `red` frame, there are initially `white` (0) pixels and sometimes one or more `gray` (5) pixels.\n\nThe transformation appears to be a \"fill\" operation occurring *within* the bounds defined by the `red` frame. Specifically, all the `white` (0) pixels located inside the `red` frame are changed to `red` (2) in the output grid. The `red` frame itself remains unchanged, the `white` pixels outside the frame remain unchanged, and crucially, the `gray` (5) pixels inside the frame also remain unchanged in their original positions.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
