"""
Identifies a rectangular frame made of red (2) pixels.
Determines the region strictly inside this frame.
Iterates through all pixels within this interior region.
If an interior pixel is white (0), it changes its color to red (2).
All other pixels (the red frame, pixels outside the frame, and non-white pixels inside the frame like gray (5)) remain unchanged.
