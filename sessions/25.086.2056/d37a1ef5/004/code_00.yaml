task_description: Fill the interior of a red rectangular frame, using gray pixels as barriers.

objects:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  - object: frame
    color: red (2)
    shape: rectangle
    description: Outlines the area of interest. Assumed to be at least 3x3 to have an interior.
  - object: interior_pixel
    location: Strictly inside the red frame.
    possible_colors: [white (0), gray (5), other] # Primarily white and gray in examples
  - object: obstacle
    color: gray (5)
    location: Inside the red frame.
    property: Blocks the fill process.
  - object: fill_pixel
    color: white (0)
    location: Inside the red frame.
    description: Potential candidates to be changed to red.
  - object: filled_pixel
    color: red (2)
    location: Inside the red frame.
    description: White pixels that have been changed to red based on the transformation rule.

actions:
  - action: identify_frame
    input: grid
    output: boundaries of the red rectangle (min/max row/col)
  - action: define_interior
    input: frame boundaries
    output: region of pixels strictly inside the frame
  - action: identify_obstacles
    input: interior pixels
    output: set of gray pixel coordinates within the interior
  - action: identify_fill_candidates
    input: interior pixels
    output: set of white pixel coordinates within the interior
  - action: determine_reachable_pixels
    description: Find all white pixels within the interior that are reachable from the inner boundary of the frame via a path consisting only of other white interior pixels (4-connectivity). Gray pixels block paths.
    input: interior region, white pixels, gray pixels, frame boundaries
    output: set of reachable white pixel coordinates
    method: Flood fill or similar connected components algorithm starting from white pixels adjacent to the inner frame boundary.
  - action: update_grid
    input: original grid, set of reachable white pixel coordinates
    output: new grid
    description: Change the color of the reachable white pixels to red (2). All other pixels retain their original color.

constraints:
  - Gray pixels block connectivity for the fill.
  - Only white pixels are candidates for being filled with red.
  - The fill process only occurs strictly within the red frame.
  - Connectivity is based on 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right).
