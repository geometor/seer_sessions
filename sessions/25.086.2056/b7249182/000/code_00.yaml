task_description: Create two mirrored 5x5 plus shapes based on the colors and positions of two input pixels.

elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - background_color: white (0)
  - element: input_pixel
    count: 2
    properties:
      - color: non-white
      - size: 1x1
      - role: markers for shape generation and positioning
  - element: output_shape
    count: 2
    properties:
      - shape_type: plus_sign (5x5)
      - color: derived from one of the input_pixels
      - size: 9 pixels each (5 horizontal + 5 vertical - 1 overlap)
      - position: determined by midpoint and orientation of input_pixels

relationships:
  - type: input_pixel_alignment
    condition: The two input_pixels always share either the same row or the same column coordinate.
  - type: color_mapping
    description: Each output_shape inherits the color of one unique input_pixel.
  - type: positioning
    description: >
      The two output_shapes are positioned symmetrically around the midpoint
      between the two input_pixels.
    details:
      - if input_pixels are horizontally aligned (same row):
          midpoint_column = (col1 + col2) / 2
          center1_col = floor(midpoint_column)
          center2_col = ceil(midpoint_column)
          center_row = row1 (which equals row2)
          Shape 1 centered at (center_row, center1_col)
          Shape 2 centered at (center_row, center2_col)
      - if input_pixels are vertically aligned (same column):
          midpoint_row = (row1 + row2) / 2
          center1_row = floor(midpoint_row)
          center2_row = ceil(midpoint_row)
          center_col = col1 (which equals col2)
          Shape 1 centered at (center1_row, center_col)
          Shape 2 centered at (center2_row, center_col)
  - type: reflection
    description: >
      The two output_shapes are reflections of each other across the axis
      defined by the midpoint between the input_pixels.

actions:
  - action: find_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates (r1, c1), (r2, c2) and colors color1, color2 of the two non-white pixels.
  - action: determine_orientation_and_midpoint
    input: pixel coordinates (r1, c1), (r2, c2)
    output: orientation ('horizontal' or 'vertical'), midpoint coordinates (mid_r, mid_c)
  - action: calculate_shape_centers
    input: orientation, midpoint coordinates, original coordinates
    output: center coordinates (cr1, cc1), (cr2, cc2) for the two shapes.
  - action: draw_shapes
    input: output_grid, shape_centers (cr1, cc1), (cr2, cc2), colors color1, color2
    output: modified output_grid with two 5x5 plus shapes drawn.

constants:
  - name: shape_pattern
    value: 5x5 plus sign
    definition: A central pixel plus the 2 pixels above, below, left, and right it, AND the 2 pixels further above, below, left and right. Alternatively, a 1x5 horizontal line and a 5x1 vertical line intersecting at their centers.
