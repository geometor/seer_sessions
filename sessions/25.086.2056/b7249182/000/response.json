            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure**: Each input grid is mostly white (0), containing exactly two single pixels of non-white colors.\n2.  **Output Structure**: Each output grid is also mostly white but contains two larger shapes, each made of one of the colors from the input pixels.\n3.  **Color Preservation**: The colors of the two non-white pixels in the input are used to construct the two shapes in the output. No new colors are introduced.\n4.  **Shape Generation**: The shapes generated in the output appear to be identical: a 5x5 \"plus\" sign or cross.\n5.  **Positional Relationship**:\n    *   The two input pixels lie either on the same row or the same column.\n    *   The two output shapes are positioned symmetrically relative to the midpoint between the original two input pixels.\n    *   If the input pixels are in the same row, the shapes are placed side-by-side horizontally, mirrored across the vertical line halfway between the input pixels' columns. Their row coordinate is the same as the input pixels' row.\n    *   If the input pixels are in the same column, the shapes are placed one above the other vertically, mirrored across the horizontal line halfway between the input pixels' rows. Their column coordinate is the same as the input pixels' column.\n6.  **Midpoint Calculation**: The center of symmetry seems to be exactly halfway between the two input pixels. Since grid coordinates are integers, if the midpoint coordinate is fractional (e.g., 6.5), the two shapes are centered on the two integer coordinates flanking the fractional midpoint (e.g., 6 and 7).\n7.  **Shape Details**: The \"plus\" shape consists of a 5-pixel horizontal line and a 5-pixel vertical line intersecting at their centers.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
