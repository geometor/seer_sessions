"""
Transforms an input grid containing exactly two non-white pixels into an output grid featuring two 5x5 plus-shaped patterns.

The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Locate the two non-white pixels in the input grid. Let their coordinates be (r1, c1) and (r2, c2), and their colors be color1 and color2, respectively. Assume these pixels are always aligned either horizontally (r1 == r2) or vertically (c1 == c2). The pixels are processed in a consistent order (e.g., sorted by row, then column).
2. Determine the midpoint between these two pixels.
3. Calculate two center points for the output shapes based on the midpoint and alignment:
    - If horizontally aligned: The centers are (r1, floor((c1+c2)/2)) and (r1, ceil((c1+c2)/2)).
    - If vertically aligned: The centers are (floor((r1+r2)/2), c1) and (ceil((r1+r2)/2), c1).
4. The shape corresponding to the first pixel (in sorted order) is centered at the 'floor' coordinate, and the shape corresponding to the second pixel is centered at the 'ceil' coordinate.
5. Draw two 5x5 plus shapes (+) on an initially white grid of the same dimensions as the input. Each shape uses the color of its corresponding input pixel and is centered at its calculated center point. The plus shape consists of a central pixel and the two pixels immediately adjacent horizontally and vertically, plus the two pixels next adjacent horizontally and vertically (i.e., a 5-pixel horizontal line and a 5-pixel vertical line intersecting at the center).
