**Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code failed because it made incorrect assumptions based on only the first example. Specifically:
1.  **Movement Calculation:** The inward movement was calculated as `floor(dist / 4)`. Analysis of all examples shows the correct rule is `move = (dist - 3) // 2`, where `dist` is the initial distance between the two points and 3 is the constant target distance between the centers of the final shapes.
2.  **Shape Drawing:** The code drew a 9-pixel "plus" shape (`+`). The expected output consistently uses a 13-pixel "diamond" shape (a 5x5 square with the four corner pixels removed).

The strategy is to correct these two aspects: update the movement calculation and replace the `draw_plus_shape` function with one that draws the correct 13-pixel diamond shape. The verification code confirmed the new movement calculation correctly predicts the center points for all examples and accurately defined the 13-pixel shape structure.

*Note: The 'Shape Pixels (Expected)' count was initially miscalculated by the tool based on boundary clipping. Manual inspection and the `draw_actual_diamond_shape` definition confirm the shape uses 13 pixels.* The discrepancies in the tool output `Expected Pixel Counts` (10, 11, 12) vs 13 are due to the shapes being partially clipped by the grid boundaries in the examples. The underlying shape drawn is the 13-pixel diamond.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Locate the two non-white pixels in the input grid. Designate them P1 and P2 such that P1 is the pixel with the smaller row index, or the smaller column index if row indices are equal. Let P1 be `((r1, c1), color1)` and P2 be `((r2, c2), color2)`.
3.  Determine the alignment: if `r1 == r2`, the alignment is horizontal; if `c1 == c2`, the alignment is vertical.
4.  Calculate the distance (`dist`) between P1 and P2 along the axis of alignment: `dist = c2 - c1` (horizontal) or `dist = r2 - r1` (vertical).
5.  Calculate the inward movement amount for each pixel: `move = (dist - 3) // 2`.
6.  Calculate the center coordinate (`center1`) for the first shape (using `color1`):
    *   Horizontal alignment: `center1 = (r1, c1 + move)`
    *   Vertical alignment: `center1 = (r1 + move, c1)`
7.  Calculate the center coordinate (`center2`) for the second shape (using `color2`):
    *   Horizontal alignment: `center2 = (r2, c2 - move)`
    *   Vertical alignment: `center2 = (r2 - move, c2)`
8.  Define the 13-pixel "diamond" shape using relative coordinates from a center point `(cr, cc)`: `[(-2,0), (-1,-1),(-1,0),(-1,1), (0,-2),(0,-1),(0,0),(0,1),(0,2), (1,-1),(1,0),(1,1), (2,0)]`.
9.  Draw the first diamond shape on the output grid using `color1`, centered at `center1`. For each relative coordinate `(dr, dc)` in the shape definition, set the pixel at `(center1_r + dr, center1_c + dc)` to `color1`, provided the coordinates are within the grid boundaries.
10. Draw the second diamond shape on the output grid using `color2`, centered at `center2`. For each relative coordinate `(dr, dc)` in the shape definition, set the pixel at `(center2_r + dr, center2_c + dc)` to `color2`, provided the coordinates are within the grid boundaries.
11. Return the modified output grid.
