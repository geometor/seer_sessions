"""
Transforms an input grid containing exactly two non-white pixels (aligned horizontally or vertically) into an output grid featuring two 5x5 plus-shaped patterns.

The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Locate the two non-white pixels in the input grid. Sort them by row, then column, to get P1 = ((r1, c1), color1) and P2 = ((r2, c2), color2).
2. Determine the alignment (horizontal if r1 == r2, vertical if c1 == c2).
3. Calculate the distance between the points along the axis of alignment (dist = c2 - c1 or dist = r2 - r1).
4. Calculate the inward movement amount: move = floor(dist / 4).
5. Calculate the center coordinate (center1_r, center1_c) for the first shape (color1):
    - Horizontal: center1_r = r1, center1_c = c1 + move
    - Vertical: center1_r = r1 + move, center1_c = c1
6. Calculate the center coordinate (center2_r, center2_c) for the second shape (color2):
    - Horizontal: center2_r = r2, center2_c = c2 - move
    - Vertical: center2_r = r2 - move, center2_c = c2
7. Draw two 5x5 plus shapes (+) on an initially white grid of the same dimensions as the input. Shape 1 uses color1 centered at (center1_r, center1_c), and Shape 2 uses color2 centered at (center2_r, center2_c). The plus shape consists of the center pixel and the pixels at distances 1 and 2 along the horizontal and vertical axes from the center.
