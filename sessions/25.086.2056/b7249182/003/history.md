"""
Transforms an input grid containing exactly two non-white pixels into an output grid featuring two 5x5 plus-shaped patterns.

The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Locate the two non-white pixels in the input grid. Let their coordinates be (r1, c1) and (r2, c2), and their colors be color1 and color2, respectively. Assume these pixels are always aligned either horizontally (r1 == r2) or vertically (c1 == c2). The pixels are processed in a consistent order (e.g., sorted by row, then column).
2. Determine the midpoint between these two pixels.
3. Calculate two center points for the output shapes based on the midpoint and alignment:
    - If horizontally aligned: The centers are (r1, floor((c1+c2)/2)) and (r1, ceil((c1+c2)/2)).
    - If vertically aligned: The centers are (floor((r1+r2)/2), c1) and (ceil((r1+r2)/2), c1).
4. The shape corresponding to the first pixel (in sorted order) is centered at the 'floor' coordinate, and the shape corresponding to the second pixel is centered at the 'ceil' coordinate.
5. Draw two 5x5 plus shapes (+) on an initially white grid of the same dimensions as the input. Each shape uses the color of its corresponding input pixel and is centered at its calculated center point. The plus shape consists of a central pixel and the two pixels immediately adjacent horizontally and vertically, plus the two pixels next adjacent horizontally and vertically (i.e., a 5-pixel horizontal line and a 5-pixel vertical line intersecting at the center).

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding of the task.

**General Assessment**

The initial code correctly identified the core concept: finding two input pixels and drawing two shapes based on their colors and positions. However, it incorrectly assumed the output shapes were always simple 5x5 plus signs centered exactly at the floored/ceiled midpoint coordinates. The discrepancies in the output shapes across all examples show that the shape's position and potentially its exact form depend more subtly on the original pixel locations and the calculated midpoint.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-examine the relationship between the input pixel coordinates, the midpoint, and the exact location and structure of the output shapes in the *expected* outputs.
2.  Use calculations to verify the new hypothesis about how the centers of the output shapes are determined.
3.  Update the natural language program and the subsequent code logic based on these refined observations.

**Metrics and Calculations**

Let's calculate the hypothesized centers for each example using the revised logic.

*   P1 = First pixel (sorted by row, then column) = (r1, c1), color1
*   P2 = Second pixel = (r2, c2), color2
*   If horizontal (r1 == r2): mid_c = (c1 + c2) / 2.0
    *   Center1 = (r1, c1 + floor((floor(mid_c) - c1) / 2))
    *   Center2 = (r2, c2 - floor((c2 - ceil(mid_c)) / 2))
*   If vertical (c1 == c2): mid_r = (r1 + r2) / 2.0
    *   Center1 = (r1 + floor((floor(mid_r) - r1) / 2), c1)
    *   Center2 = (r2 - floor((r2 - ceil(mid_r)) / 2), c2)
*   The shape drawn appears to be a 5x5 plus (+) centered at these new coordinates.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color white (0).
2.  Locate the two non-white pixels in the input grid. Sort them based on their coordinates (first by row index, then by column index) to get pixel P1 = ((r1, c1), color1) and pixel P2 = ((r2, c2), color2).
3.  Determine the alignment of the pixels:
    *   If `r1 == r2`, the alignment is horizontal.
    *   If `c1 == c2`, the alignment is vertical.
4.  Calculate the midpoint coordinate along the axis of alignment:
    *   If horizontal, calculate `mid_c = (c1 + c2) / 2.0`.
    *   If vertical, calculate `mid_r = (r1 + r2) / 2.0`.
5.  Calculate the center coordinate (center1_r, center1_c) for the first output shape (corresponding to P1):
    *   If horizontal: `center1_r = r1`, `center1_c = c1 + floor((floor(mid_c) - c1) / 2)`.
    *   If vertical: `center1_r = r1 + floor((floor(mid_r) - r1) / 2)`, `center1_c = c1`.
6.  Calculate the center coordinate (center2_r, center2_c) for the second output shape (corresponding to P2):
    *   If horizontal: `center2_r = r2`, `center2_c = c2 - floor((c2 - ceil(mid_c)) / 2)`.
    *   If vertical: `center2_r = r2 - floor((r2 - ceil(mid_r)) / 2)`, `center2_c = c2`.
7.  Draw the first shape: Create a 5x5 plus shape (+) using `color1`, centered at (center1_r, center1_c), onto the output grid. Ensure drawing stays within grid boundaries. The 5x5 plus shape includes the center pixel, the two pixels immediately adjacent horizontally/vertically, and the two pixels next-adjacent horizontally/vertically.
8.  Draw the second shape: Create a 5x5 plus shape (+) using `color2`, centered at (center2_r, center2_c), onto the output grid. Ensure drawing stays within grid boundaries.
9.  Return the modified output grid.
