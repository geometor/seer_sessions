            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels represented by integer color values. The grids maintain their dimensions.\n2.  **Color Focus:** The transformation seems primarily concerned with the arrangement of non-white pixels (colors 1-9). White pixels (color 0) act as background or separators.\n3.  **Row Operations:** The changes between input and output occur at the row level. Entire rows are being rearranged, but the content within each row remains unchanged.\n4.  **Color Grouping:** Rows containing the same non-white color appear grouped together contiguously in the input. For example, in `train_1`, rows 1 and 2 both feature blue, rows 4, 5, and 6 feature gray, and rows 7 and 8 feature red.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** Within each contiguous block of rows defined by a single non-white color, the order of the rows is reversed in the output grid.\n    *   In `train_1`, the blue rows (1, 2) become (2, 1). The gray rows (4, 5, 6) become (6, 5, 4). The red rows (7, 8) become (8, 7).\n    *   In `train_2`, the red rows (1, 2, 3) become (3, 2, 1). The green rows (4, 5) become (5, 4), etc.\n    *   In `train_3`, the maroon rows (1, 2) become (2, 1). The green rows (4, 5) become (5, 4).\n6.  **Single-Row Blocks:** If a color block consists of only one row (like the azure row in `train_1` or the yellow row in `train_3`), reversing it results in the same row, so it appears unchanged.\n7.  **White Rows:** Rows containing only white pixels are not part of these colored blocks and remain in their original relative positions, acting as separators between the blocks.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
