facts:
  - grid_dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - elements:
      - type: Pixel
        properties:
          - color: Integer value 0-9 (0=white, 1-9=non-white)
      - type: Row
        properties:
          - index: Vertical position in the grid.
          - content: Sequence of pixels.
          - composition: Can be all white, or contain white and a single non-white color.
      - type: Row Block
        properties:
          - contiguity: Composed of vertically adjacent rows.
          - color_uniformity: All rows in the block share the same single non-white color (along with potentially white pixels).
          - boundary: Bounded above and below by either the grid edge or rows with different compositions (all white or different non-white color).
          - rows: The list of rows belonging to the block.
          - index_range: The start and end row index occupied by the block.
  - actions:
      - identify_blocks: Scan the input grid row by row to find contiguous blocks of rows sharing the same single non-white color.
      - reverse_rows: Within each identified block, reverse the order of the rows.
      - reconstruct_grid: Assemble the output grid by placing the (potentially reversed) blocks and the unchanged all-white rows into their corresponding positions.
  - relationships:
      - The output grid is derived solely from rearranging rows of the input grid.
      - The rearrangement is determined by grouping rows based on shared non-white color and reversing the order within those groups.
