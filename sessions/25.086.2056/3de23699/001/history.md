Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure**: Each input grid contains exactly two distinct non-white colors against a white background.
2.  **Object Identification**: One non-white color forms a contiguous 'main object'. The other non-white color appears as four identical pixels, which I'll call 'markers'. These markers are typically located symmetrically, often forming the corners of a rectangle. In all examples, the main object has more pixels than the combined marker pixels.
3.  **Marker Role**: The four marker pixels define a bounding box or a 'region of interest' (ROI). The color of these markers dictates the color of the object in the output grid.
4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves extracting the shape of the 'main object' that falls *strictly inside* the boundaries defined by the markers, changing its color to the marker color, and placing this transformed shape onto a new, smaller output grid.
5.  **Output Grid Size**: The dimensions of the output grid are determined by the dimensions of the ROI defined by the markers. Specifically, the output grid's height is 2 less than the ROI's height, and its width is 2 less than the ROI's width.
6.  **Coordinate Mapping**: The pixels of the main object within the inner region of the ROI (excluding the boundary defined by the markers) are mapped directly to the output grid, preserving their relative positions.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Extracts a shape defined by one color within a boundary defined by another color, re-colors the shape, and places it on a smaller grid.

input_elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: Fills the grid initially.
  - type: main_object
    properties:
      - Contiguous group of pixels of a single non-white color.
      - Larger pixel count compared to marker_pixels.
      - Its shape (within ROI) is preserved in the output.
      - Its original color is discarded in the output.
  - type: marker_pixels
    properties:
      - Group of exactly four pixels.
      - All four pixels have the same non-white color, distinct from the main_object color.
      - Typically form the corners of a rectangle.
      - Define the Region of Interest (ROI).
      - Their color determines the output object's color.

relationships:
  - The marker_pixels define a bounding box (ROI). Let the minimum row/col be (r1, c1) and max row/col be (r2, c2).
  - The main_object may extend outside the ROI, but only the portion strictly inside the ROI (rows r1+1 to r2-1, cols c1+1 to c2-1) matters for the output shape.
  - The output grid dimensions are (r2 - r1 - 1) by (c2 - c1 - 1).
  - The color of the marker_pixels becomes the color of the shape in the output grid.

actions:
  - Identify the two non-white colors present.
  - Count pixels for each color to distinguish the main_object color from the marker_pixel color.
  - Find the coordinates of the four marker_pixels.
  - Determine the bounding box (ROI) defined by the marker_pixels: (min_row, min_col) to (max_row, max_col).
  - Define the 'inner region' of the ROI: (min_row + 1, min_col + 1) to (max_row - 1, max_col - 1).
  - Calculate the output grid dimensions: height = max_row - min_row - 1, width = max_col - min_col - 1.
  - Create a new output grid of the calculated dimensions, initialized to white (0).
  - Iterate through the pixels in the input grid's 'inner region'.
  - If a pixel (r, c) within the inner region belongs to the main_object:
    - Calculate its corresponding position in the output grid: (r_out, c_out) = (r - (min_row + 1), c - (min_col + 1)).
    - Set the color of the output grid pixel at (r_out, c_out) to the marker_pixel color.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid to identify the two distinct non-white pixel colors present.
2.  Count the occurrences of each non-white color. The color with exactly four occurrences is the 'marker color'; the other is the 'main object color'.
3.  Find the coordinates of the four pixels having the marker color.
4.  Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices among these four marker coordinates. Let these define the Region of Interest (ROI) as `(min_row, min_col)` to `(max_row, max_col)`.
5.  Calculate the dimensions of the output grid: `output_height = max_row - min_row - 1`, `output_width = max_col - min_col - 1`.
6.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with dimensions `output_height` x `output_width`, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
7.  Iterate through each pixel coordinate `(r, c)` in the input grid, checking only those pixels that fall strictly within the ROI boundaries (i.e., where `min_row < r < max_row` and `min_col < c < max_col`).
8.  For each such pixel `(r, c)`:
    a.  If the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid is the 'main object color':
        i.  Calculate the corresponding coordinate `(r_out, c_out)` in the output grid: `r_out = r - (min_row + 1)`, `c_out = c - (min_col + 1)`.
        ii. Set the color of the pixel at `(r_out, c_out)` in the output grid to the 'marker color'.
9.  Return the completed output grid.
