            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure**: Each input grid contains exactly two distinct non-white colors against a white background.\n2.  **Object Identification**: One non-white color forms a contiguous 'main object'. The other non-white color appears as four identical pixels, which I'll call 'markers'. These markers are typically located symmetrically, often forming the corners of a rectangle. In all examples, the main object has more pixels than the combined marker pixels.\n3.  **Marker Role**: The four marker pixels define a bounding box or a 'region of interest' (ROI). The color of these markers dictates the color of the object in the output grid.\n4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves extracting the shape of the 'main object' that falls *strictly inside* the boundaries defined by the markers, changing its color to the marker color, and placing this transformed shape onto a new, smaller output grid.\n5.  **Output Grid Size**: The dimensions of the output grid are determined by the dimensions of the ROI defined by the markers. Specifically, the output grid's height is 2 less than the ROI's height, and its width is 2 less than the ROI's width.\n6.  **Coordinate Mapping**: The pixels of the main object within the inner region of the ROI (excluding the boundary defined by the markers) are mapped directly to the output grid, preserving their relative positions.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
