Its size and position vary across examples, but it always forms a solid rectangle.\n    *   A single red (2) pixel.\n    *   A single azure (8) pixel.\n    *   The background is filled with orange (7) pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The gray block remains unchanged in the output.\n    *   The red and azure pixels change their positions.\n    *   The original locations of the red and azure pixels are replaced with the background orange (7) color.\n    *   The new position of the red pixel seems related to the original position of the *azure* pixel and the position of the gray block. Specifically, it moves to the column where the azure pixel was originally located, and to the row immediately above the topmost row of the gray block.\n    *   The new position of the azure pixel seems related only to the position of the gray block. Specifically, it moves to the bottom-right corner of the gray block (maximum row and maximum column occupied by the gray block).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
