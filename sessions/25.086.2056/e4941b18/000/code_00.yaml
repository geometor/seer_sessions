task_description: Reposition a red pixel and an azure pixel relative to a gray rectangular block.
elements:
  - object: background
    color: orange (7)
    role: Fills empty space.
  - object: gray_block
    color: gray (5)
    shape: rectangle
    properties:
      - static: Its position, shape, and color do not change between input and output.
      - boundary: Defines target locations for other objects.
      - location: Defined by its minimum row (top), maximum row (bottom), minimum column (left), and maximum column (right).
  - object: red_pixel
    color: red (2)
    shape: single pixel
    properties:
      - mobile: Its position changes.
      - initial_location: (row_in_red, col_in_red)
      - final_location: Determined by the initial azure pixel column and the gray block's top edge. (gray_min_row - 1, col_in_azure)
  - object: azure_pixel
    color: azure (8)
    shape: single pixel
    properties:
      - mobile: Its position changes.
      - initial_location: (row_in_azure, col_in_azure)
      - final_location: Determined by the gray block's bottom-right corner. (gray_max_row, gray_max_col)
relationships:
  - The final position of the red pixel depends on the initial column of the azure pixel and the top row of the gray block.
  - The final position of the azure pixel depends on the bottom row and rightmost column of the gray block.
actions:
  - Find the gray block and determine its boundaries (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
  - Find the initial coordinates of the red pixel (row_in_red, col_in_red).
  - Find the initial coordinates of the azure pixel (row_in_azure, col_in_azure).
  - Create a copy of the input grid for the output.
  - Change the pixel at (row_in_red, col_in_red) in the output grid to orange (7).
  - Change the pixel at (row_in_azure, col_in_azure) in the output grid to orange (7).
  - Calculate the final red pixel position: (gray_min_row - 1, col_in_azure).
  - Calculate the final azure pixel position: (gray_max_row, gray_max_col).
  - Set the pixel at the final red position in the output grid to red (2).
  - Set the pixel at the final azure position in the output grid to azure (8).
