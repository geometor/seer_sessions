Identifies two main non-white colors: C1 forming a large contiguous shape, and C2 forming crosshair-like lines.
Removes C2 pixels that are located within the bounding box of the C1 shape.
Calculates a shift based on the width of the C1 shape's bounding box.
Redraws the C2 pixels as a new vertical line shifted right and a new horizontal line shifted up, positioned outside the C1 shape's bounding box.
