            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 12x12 grids for both input and output.\n2.  **Colors Used:**\n    *   Example 1: white(0), blue(1), azure(8)\n    *   Example 2: white(0), red(2), green(3)\n    *   Example 3: white(0), green(3), yellow(4)\n3.  **Key Objects:** In each input grid, there appear to be two main structures:\n    *   A larger, contiguous shape made of one color (blue 'H' in Ex1, red square-like shape in Ex2, green plus-like shape in Ex3). Let's call this the \"main shape\" and its color C1.\n    *   A pattern of pixels of a second color (azure in Ex1, green in Ex2, yellow in Ex3), often forming a cross-like structure or lines extending across the grid. Let's call this the \"crosshair\" and its color C2.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:**\n    *   The main shape (C1) seems preserved in the output grid in terms of its shape and color.\n    *   The crosshair pixels (C2) *inside* the main shape (C1) or on its immediate border are removed (changed to white) in the output.\n    *   The crosshair pixels (C2) *outside* the main shape (C1) are repositioned in the output.\n    *   The new positions of the C2 pixels form a new crosshair structure (vertical and horizontal lines).\n    *   The position of this new crosshair seems related to the original position of the input crosshair and the size/bounding box of the main shape.\n5.  **Crosshair Repositioning Logic:**\n    *   Let the bounding box of the main shape (C1) be defined by min/max row and column indices. Let the width be `W`.\n    *   Let the primary row (`center_row`) and column (`center_col`) of the input crosshair (C2) be the row and column indices containing the most C2 pixels.\n    *   Calculate a shift value `S = floor(W / 2)`.\n    *   The new vertical line of C2 pixels is placed at column `target_col = center_col + S`.\n    *   The new horizontal line of C2 pixels is placed at row `target_row = center_row - S`.\n    *   These new lines are drawn *only* in the regions outside the bounding box of the main shape (C1). Specifically, the vertical line is drawn for rows outside the C1 row range, and the horizontal line is drawn for columns outside the C1 column range.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Determine which color forms the large, contiguous \"main shape\" (Color C1) and which forms the \"crosshair\" pattern (Color C2).\n2.  Find the bounding box of the main shape (Color C1). Record its minimum row (`min_row`), maximum row (`max_row`), minimum column (`min_col`), maximum column (`max_col`), and its width `W = max_col - min_col + 1`.\n3.  Find the row index (`center_row`) that contains the highest number of Color C2 pixels in the input grid.\n4.  Find the column index (`center_col`) that contains the highest number of Color C2 pixels in the input grid.\n5.  Calculate the shift value `S = floor(W / 2)`.\n6.  Calculate the target row for the new horizontal line: `target_row = center_row - S`.\n7.  Calculate the target column for the new vertical line: `target_col = center_col + S`.\n8.  Create a new grid for the output, initially identical to the input grid.\n9.  Iterate through all pixels (`r`, `c`) within the main shape's bounding box (i.e., where `min_row <= r <= max_row` and `min_col <= c <= max_col`). If the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the input grid has Color C2, change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).\n10. Iterate through all rows `r` of the grid. If a row `r` is outside the main shape's bounding box (i.e., `r < min_row` or `r > max_row`), change the pixel at (`r`, `target_col`) in the output grid to Color C2.\n11. Iterate through all columns `c` of the grid. If a column `c` is outside the main shape's bounding box (i.e., `c < min_col` or `c > max_col`), change the pixel at (`target_row`, `c`) in the output grid to Color C2.\n12. The resulting grid is the final output."
