- Task: Transform a grid containing two non-white colors, C1 and C2.
- Objects:
    - C1_Shape:
        - Type: The largest contiguous block of a single non-white color (C1).
        - Properties:
            - color: C1
            - bounding_box: (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col)
            - width: Calculated from bounding_box (max_col - min_col + 1)
            - height: Calculated from bounding_box (max_row - min_row + 1)
        - Persistence: The C1_Shape remains unchanged in the output grid.
    - C2_Crosshair:
        - Type: Pixels of the second non-white color (C2), typically forming a horizontal and a vertical line intersecting within the C1_Shape's bounding box in the input.
        - Properties:
            - color: C2
            - center: (center_row, center_col), determined by the row and column with the maximum count of C2 pixels in the input grid.
        - Persistence: The original C2_Crosshair is completely removed. New lines of color C2 are drawn.
- Parameters:
    - Shift (S): An integer value calculated as `floor(C1_Shape.width / 2)`.
    - Target_Row: Calculated as `C2_Crosshair.center.row - S`.
    - Target_Col: Calculated as `C2_Crosshair.center.col + S`.
- Actions:
    1. Identify C1 color and the largest contiguous C1_Shape object.
    2. Identify C2 color (the other non-white color).
    3. Determine the bounding_box and width of the C1_Shape.
    4. Determine the center of the original C2_Crosshair.
    5. Calculate the Shift (S), Target_Row, and Target_Col.
    6. Create an output grid initialized with white (0).
    7. Copy the pixels belonging to the C1_Shape onto the output grid.
    8. Draw a horizontal line of color C2 at Target_Row across the entire grid width, but *exclude* pixels where the column index `c` satisfies `C1_Shape.bounding_box.min_col <= c <= C1_Shape.bounding_box.max_col`.
    9. Draw a vertical line of color C2 at Target_Col across the entire grid height, but *exclude* pixels where the row index `r` satisfies `C1_Shape.bounding_box.min_row <= r <= C1_Shape.bounding_box.max_row`.
