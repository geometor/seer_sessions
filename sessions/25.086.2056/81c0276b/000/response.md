*   **Perception**: The input grids have a distinct structure. They are divided into smaller, equal-sized rectangular cells by grid lines composed of a single, repeating color. Within these cells, often surrounded by white (0), are 2x2 blocks of various colors. The output grids are much smaller and seem to summarize information about these 2x2 colored blocks found in the input grid's cells. Specifically, the output represents the frequency of each distinct color (excluding the grid line color and the background white color) found in the 2x2 blocks across all cells. Each unique color gets a row in the output, represented as a horizontal bar whose length corresponds to its frequency (count). The rows are ordered based on these frequencies in ascending order.

```yaml
    elements:
      - object: input_grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
          - structure: Contains grid lines and cells
      - object: grid_lines
        properties:
          - forms: horizontal and vertical lines
          - color: uniform color specific to each example (e.g., green(3), magenta(6), red(2))
          - function: divides the input_grid into cells
      - object: cells
        properties:
          - location: regions between grid_lines
          - size: uniform (e.g., 4x4 excluding lines)
          - content: may contain 2x2 blocks of color surrounded by background
      - object: color_block
        properties:
          - shape: 2x2 square
          - color: uniform, non-background (0), non-grid_line color
          - location: within a cell
      - object: output_grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
          - structure: rows representing unique colors from input blocks
          - rows: contain horizontal bars
          - bar_color: matches a unique color_block color from input
          - bar_length: equals the count of corresponding color_blocks in the input cells
          - row_order: ascending order based on bar_length (count)
          - background: remaining cells are white (0)

    relationships:
      - The grid_line color defines the cell structure.
      - color_blocks exist within cells.
      - Each unique color_block color (excluding grid_line color) corresponds to a row in the output_grid.
      - The count of each unique color_block color determines the length of the bar in its corresponding output row.
      - The rows in the output_grid are ordered by the counts (bar lengths) in ascending order.

    actions:
      - Identify the grid_line color.
      - Identify the cells based on grid_lines.
      - Scan cells to find all 2x2 color_blocks (ignoring background and grid_line colors).
      - Count the occurrences of each unique color_block color.
      - Determine output dimensions: rows = unique color count, columns = max count.
      - Sort the unique colors by their counts (ascending).
      - Construct the output_grid row by row based on the sorted colors and their counts.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Analyze the input grid to identify the color that forms the persistent horizontal and vertical grid lines. Store this as the `grid_color`.
    2.  Determine the boundaries of the cells separated by the `grid_color` lines.
    3.  Initialize an empty dictionary or map to store counts of colors found in 2x2 blocks.
    4.  Iterate through each cell defined in step 2.
    5.  Within each cell, search for any 2x2 block composed of a single color `C`.
    6.  If such a 2x2 block is found and its color `C` is not white (0) and not the `grid_color`, increment the count for color `C` in the map.
    7.  After checking all cells, determine the unique colors found and their counts from the map.
    8.  Calculate the number of rows for the output grid (`num_rows`), which is the number of unique colors found.
    9.  Calculate the number of columns for the output grid (`num_cols`), which is the maximum count among all found colors.
    10. Sort the unique colors based on their counts in ascending order. If two colors have the same count, their relative order does not matter based on the examples (though using color value as a tie-breaker is reasonable).
    11. Create an empty output grid of size `num_rows` x `num_cols`, initialized with white (0).
    12. Iterate through the sorted colors (from step 10). For each color `C` with count `N`, fill the next available row in the output grid: place the color `C` in the first `N` columns, leaving the remaining columns as white (0).
    13. Return the constructed output grid.
