Within these cells, often surrounded by white (0), are 2x2 blocks of various colors. The output grids are much smaller and seem to summarize information about these 2x2 colored blocks found in the input grid's cells. Specifically, the output represents the frequency of each distinct color (excluding the grid line color and the background white color) found in the 2x2 blocks across all cells. Each unique color gets a row in the output, represented as a horizontal bar whose length corresponds to its frequency (count). The rows are ordered based on these frequencies in ascending order.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
