task_description: Transform an input grid into an output grid of doubled dimensions, containing two copies of the input grid placed in specific quadrants.

input_grid:
  properties:
    - height: H (variable)
    - width: W (variable)
    - pixels: colored (1-9) or white (0)

output_grid:
  properties:
    - height: 2 * H
    - width: 2 * W
    - background: initialized to white (0)

transformation_rule:
  - step: Determine input grid dimensions (H, W).
  - step: Create output grid (2H, 2W) initialized with white (0).
  - step: Analyze input grid diagonals.
    - calculation: Count non-white pixels on the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right). Let this be `main_count`.
    - calculation: Count non-white pixels on the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left). Let this be `anti_count`.
  - step: Determine placement based on diagonal counts.
    - condition: If `main_count >= anti_count`:
      - action: Place one copy of the input grid in the top-left quadrant (rows 0 to H-1, cols 0 to W-1).
      - action: Place a second copy of the input grid in the bottom-right quadrant (rows H to 2H-1, cols W to 2W-1).
    - condition: If `main_count < anti_count`:
      - action: Place one copy of the input grid in the top-right quadrant (rows 0 to H-1, cols W to 2W-1).
      - action: Place a second copy of the input grid in the bottom-left quadrant (rows H to 2H-1, cols 0 to W-1).
  - step: Return the final output grid.

derived_facts_from_examples:
  - example_1:
      input_size: 5x5
      main_count: 5
      anti_count: 1
      condition_met: main_count >= anti_count
      expected_placement: Top-Left, Bottom-Right
  - example_2:
      input_size: 6x6
      main_count: 6
      anti_count: 2
      condition_met: main_count >= anti_count
      expected_placement: Top-Left, Bottom-Right
  - example_3:
      input_size: 8x8
      main_count: 0
      anti_count: 8
      condition_met: main_count < anti_count
      expected_placement: Top-Right, Bottom-Left

validation_notes:
  - The transformation logic successfully explains Example 3.
  - The provided 'Expected Output' for Examples 1 and 2 appear inconsistent with the rule derived from Example 3 and the code's consistent behavior across all examples. The mismatches are likely due to errors in the provided 'Expected Output' data for those examples.
