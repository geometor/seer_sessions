Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Size Change:** In all three examples, the output grid's dimensions (height and width) are exactly double the input grid's dimensions.
    *   Example 1: 5x5 input -> 10x10 output
    *   Example 2: 6x6 input -> 12x12 output
    *   Example 3: 8x8 input -> 16x16 output
2.  **Content Preservation:** The original pattern or arrangement of non-white pixels from the input grid is preserved in the output grid.
3.  **Repetition and Placement:** The original input pattern appears twice in the output grid.
    *   One copy is placed in the top-left quadrant of the output grid, occupying the same row and column indices as the original input.
    *   A second, identical copy is placed in the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid. If the input grid has dimensions H x W, this second copy starts at row H, column W.
4.  **Background Filling:** The areas of the output grid not occupied by the copied input patterns (specifically, the top-right and bottom-left quadrants) are filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).

**Facts:**


```yaml
Transformation: Tiling/Repetition
Input:
  - name: input_grid
    type: Grid
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - content: original_pattern
Output:
  - name: output_grid
    type: Grid
    properties:
      - height: 2 * H
      - width: 2 * W
      - content: derived
Relationship:
  - type: Copy
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    details:
      - The entire input_grid is copied.
      - Placement_1: Top-left quadrant (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
      - Placement_2: Bottom-right quadrant (rows H to 2H-1, columns W to 2W-1).
  - type: Fill
    target: output_grid
    details:
      - Area_1: Top-right quadrant (rows 0 to H-1, columns W to 2W-1).
      - Area_2: Bottom-left quadrant (rows H to 2H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
      - Fill_Value: 0 (white)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (2 * H) x (2 * W).
3.  Initialize all cells of the output grid with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Copy the entire input grid pattern into the top-left quadrant of the output grid (from row 0, column 0 to row H-1, column W-1).
5.  Copy the entire input grid pattern again into the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid (from row H, column W to row 2H-1, column 2W-1).
6.  The resulting grid is the final output.
