Task: Summarize a grid of colored rectangular blocks.

Input:
  - A grid composed entirely of adjacent, solid-colored rectangular blocks.
  - Each block is contiguous and has a uniform color.
  - Blocks tile the grid completely.

Output:
  - A smaller grid.
  - Dimensions of the output grid correspond to the number of block rows and block columns in the input grid's block arrangement.
  - Each cell in the output grid represents a single block from the input grid.
  - The color of each output cell is the same as the color of the corresponding block in the input.
  - The position of a cell in the output grid corresponds to the relative position (row, column) of the represented block within the input grid's block structure.

Relationships:
  - Each block in the input maps to exactly one cell in the output.
  - The color property is preserved during the mapping.
  - The relative spatial arrangement (block grid structure) is preserved.

Derived Properties:
  - The boundaries between blocks in the input define the structure of the output grid.
  - The top-left corner pixel of each block is sufficient to determine its color and its position within the block structure.
  - The number of output rows equals the number of distinct rows where blocks start.
  - The number of output columns equals the number of distinct columns where blocks start.
