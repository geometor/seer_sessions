Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure**: The input grids consist of several distinct, contiguous, rectangular blocks, each filled with a single solid color. These blocks are arranged adjacently, tiling the entire input grid without any background color (white/0) present in the examples shown.
2.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. They also consist of solid color pixels.
3.  **Relationship**: The output grid appears to be a compressed representation or summary of the input grid. Each pixel in the output grid corresponds to one of the rectangular blocks in the input grid. The color of the output pixel is the same as the color of the corresponding input block.
4.  **Spatial Mapping**: The relative positions of the colored pixels in the output grid mirror the relative positions of the corresponding colored blocks in the input grid. If the input grid can be seen as a grid of blocks (e.g., 2 rows by 3 columns of blocks), the output grid will have the same dimensions (2x3), with each cell taking the color of the block at that position.
5.  **Block Identification**: The core of the task is identifying these distinct rectangular blocks and their colors and relative positions.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Summarize a grid of colored rectangular blocks.

Input:
  - A grid composed entirely of adjacent, solid-colored rectangular blocks.
  - Each block is contiguous and has a uniform color.
  - Blocks tile the grid completely.

Output:
  - A smaller grid.
  - Dimensions of the output grid correspond to the number of block rows and block columns in the input grid's block arrangement.
  - Each cell in the output grid represents a single block from the input grid.
  - The color of each output cell is the same as the color of the corresponding block in the input.
  - The position of a cell in the output grid corresponds to the relative position (row, column) of the represented block within the input grid's block structure.

Relationships:
  - Each block in the input maps to exactly one cell in the output.
  - The color property is preserved during the mapping.
  - The relative spatial arrangement (block grid structure) is preserved.

Derived Properties:
  - The boundaries between blocks in the input define the structure of the output grid.
  - The top-left corner pixel of each block is sufficient to determine its color and its position within the block structure.
  - The number of output rows equals the number of distinct rows where blocks start.
  - The number of output columns equals the number of distinct columns where blocks start.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Block Structure**: Scan the input grid to find the top-left corner coordinates of all distinct, contiguous, solid-colored rectangular blocks. Store the color and the (row, column) coordinates of the top-left pixel for each unique block.
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions**: Collect all unique row coordinates from the identified top-left corners and sort them; the count of these unique rows determines the height of the output grid. Collect all unique column coordinates from the identified top-left corners and sort them; the count of these unique columns determines the width of the output grid.
3.  **Create Output Grid**: Initialize an empty output grid with the determined height and width.
4.  **Populate Output Grid**: For each identified block:
    a.  Find the index of its top-left corner's row coordinate within the sorted list of unique row coordinates. This is the row index (`output_row`) for the output grid.
    b.  Find the index of its top-left corner's column coordinate within the sorted list of unique column coordinates. This is the column index (`output_col`) for the output grid.
    c.  Place the color of the block into the output grid at the calculated position (`output_grid[output_row][output_col]`).
5.  **Return Output**: The fully populated output grid is the result.
