These blocks are arranged adjacently, tiling the entire input grid without any background color (white/0) present in the examples shown.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. They also consist of solid color pixels.\n3.  **Relationship**: The output grid appears to be a compressed representation or summary of the input grid. Each pixel in the output grid corresponds to one of the rectangular blocks in the input grid. The color of the output pixel is the same as the color of the corresponding input block.\n4.  **Spatial Mapping**: The relative positions of the colored pixels in the output grid mirror the relative positions of the corresponding colored blocks in the input grid. If the input grid can be seen as a grid of blocks (e.g., 2 rows by 3 columns of blocks), the output grid will have the same dimensions (2x3), with each cell taking the color of the block at that position.\n5.  **Block Identification**: The core of the task is identifying these distinct rectangular blocks and their colors and relative positions.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Store the color and the (row, column) coordinates of the top-left pixel for each unique block.\n2.  **Determine Output Dimensions**: Collect all unique row coordinates from the identified top-left corners and sort them; the count of these unique rows determines the height of the output grid. Collect all unique column coordinates from the identified top-left corners and sort them; the count of these unique columns determines the width of the output grid.\n3.  **Create Output Grid**: Initialize an empty output grid with the determined height and width.\n4.  **Populate Output Grid**: For each identified block:\n    a.  Find the index of its top-left corner's row coordinate within the sorted list of unique row coordinates. This is the row index (`output_row`) for the output grid.\n    b.  Find the index of its top-left corner's column coordinate within the sorted list of unique column coordinates. This is the column index (`output_col`) for the output grid.\n    c.  Place the color of the block into the output grid at the calculated position (`output_grid[output_row][output_col]`).\n5.  **Return Output**: The fully populated output grid is the result."
