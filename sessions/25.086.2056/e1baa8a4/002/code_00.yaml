task_description: Scale down a grid composed of solid-colored rectangles.
input_features:
  - type: grid
  - description: Composed of adjacent, non-overlapping, solid-colored rectangular blocks that tile the entire grid.
  - properties:
      - height: variable (1 to 30)
      - width: variable (1 to 30)
      - pixels: integers 0-9 representing colors
output_features:
  - type: grid
  - description: A smaller grid where each cell represents one rectangular block from the input grid.
  - properties:
      - height: Number of unique block rows in the input.
      - width: Number of unique block columns in the input.
      - pixels: The color of the corresponding block in the input grid.
transformation:
  - name: block_summarization
  - steps:
      - Identify all unique row indices where a vertical color change occurs (comparing pixel[r, c] with pixel[r-1, c]). Add row 0 to this set. Sort these row indices; these define the start rows of block rows.
      - Identify all unique column indices where a horizontal color change occurs (comparing pixel[r, c] with pixel[r, c-1]). Add column 0 to this set. Sort these column indices; these define the start columns of block columns.
      - The number of output rows is the number of unique start rows found.
      - The number of output columns is the number of unique start columns found.
      - Create an output grid of the determined dimensions.
      - For each cell (out_r, out_c) in the output grid:
          - Find the corresponding starting row index `in_r` from the sorted list of start rows (at index `out_r`).
          - Find the corresponding starting column index `in_c` from the sorted list of start columns (at index `out_c`).
          - The color of the output cell (out_r, out_c) is the color of the input grid pixel at (in_r, in_c).
relationship: The output grid preserves the relative spatial arrangement and color of the blocks found in the input grid, effectively acting as a thumbnail or summary representation.
constraints:
  - Input grid is always perfectly tiled by solid-color rectangular blocks.
