The magenta lines are at rows 3 and 7, and columns 3 and 7.\n    *   Within some of the 3x3 areas defined by the magenta lines, there are 'plus' shapes made of red (2) pixels centered in the 3x3 area. The plus shape is `[[7, 2, 7], [2, 7, 2], [7, 2, 7]]`. The remaining cells in these 3x3 areas are orange (7).\n    *   The transformation rule appears to depend critically on the *number* of red plus shapes present in the input grid.\n    *   In examples `train_1` and `train_2`, there are exactly two red plus shapes. The output grid is the same size (11x11). The magenta lines and the red plus shapes are preserved. Two of the 3x3 areas that originally contained only orange pixels are modified with new patterns involving gray (5) or azure (8) pixels, replacing the orange background. The specific locations modified and the patterns used (gray or azure) seem to depend on the locations of the initial two red plus shapes.\n        *   The gray pattern is `[[7, 5, 7], [5, 7, 5], [7, 5, 7]]`.\n        *   The azure pattern is `[[7, 8, 7], [8, 7, 8], [7, 8, 7]]`.\n    *   In example `train_3`, there are four red plus shapes. The output grid is drastically different: it's a 16x16 grid filled entirely with orange (7). This suggests a conditional rule based on the count of red shapes.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
