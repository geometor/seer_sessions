Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1. Analyze the input 11x11 grid. Identify the nine 3x3 subgrids demarcated by the magenta (6) lines at rows 3, 7 and columns 3, 7.
2. Count the number of 3x3 subgrids that contain a centered red (2) plus shape (`[[7, 2, 7], [2, 7, 2], [7, 2, 7]]`). Let this count be `N`.
3. If `N` is not equal to 2:
    - Construct and return a new 16x16 grid filled entirely with orange (7).
4. If `N` is equal to 2:
    - Create a copy of the input 11x11 grid.
    - Identify the locations (indices 0-8, row-major) of the two subgrids containing the red plus shapes. Let this set of indices be `R`.
    - Define the modification patterns: 
        - `P_gray = [[7, 5, 7], [5, 7, 5], [7, 5, 7]]`
        - `P_azure = [[7, 8, 7], [8, 7, 8], [7, 8, 7]]`
    - Determine the target subgrid indices and their patterns based on the set `R`:
        - If `R` is `{5, 8}` (subgrids at row 4, col 8 and row 8, col 8), modify subgrid at index 0 (row 0, col 0) with `P_gray` and subgrid at index 2 (row 0, col 8) with `P_azure`.
        - If `R` is `{2, 4}` (subgrids at row 0, col 8 and row 4, col 4), modify subgrid at index 3 (row 4, col 0) with `P_azure` and subgrid at index 7 (row 8, col 4) with `P_gray`.
    - Return the modified 11x11 grid.
