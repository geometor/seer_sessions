Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

## Perception Analysis

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple copies of small, distinct patterns (objects) composed of non-white pixels. These objects are arranged linearly along a diagonal path within the grid. The rest of the grid is filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  **Object Identification:**
    *   In `train_1`, the object is a 2x2 pattern: `[[red, red], [green, red]]`. It appears 6 times.
    *   In `train_2`, the object involves two pixels/shapes in adjacent rows: an azure pixel above a horizontal red pair: `[[azure, white], [red, red]]`. It appears 6 times.
    *   In `train_3`, the object is a 2x2 pattern: `[[red, blue], [blue, white]]`. It appears 5 times.
3.  **Object Arrangement:** The objects are placed such that their corresponding points (e.g., top-left corners) form a straight line (a diagonal).
    *   In `train_1`, the diagonal runs from the top-right towards the bottom-left.
    *   In `train_2` and `train_3`, the diagonal runs from the top-left towards the bottom-right.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the reversal of the *order* of these objects along their diagonal path. The object that was first along the diagonal in the input appears last in the output, the second object appears second-to-last, and so on. The object shapes themselves remain unchanged. The background remains white.
5.  **Grid Size:** The grid size remains constant between input and output.

## YAML Fact Sheet


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    - background_color: The background is consistently white (0).
  elements:
    - type: object
      description: Small, contiguous patterns of non-white pixels.
      properties:
        - shape_consistency: All non-background objects within a single input grid have the identical shape and color composition.
        - arrangement: Objects are positioned along a diagonal line.
        - distinctness: Objects are spatially separated from each other.
  transformation:
    - action: identify_objects
      description: Locate all instances of the repeating non-white object and their positions (e.g., top-left corner).
    - action: determine_order
      description: Establish the sequence of objects along the diagonal path.
    - action: reverse_order
      description: Reverse the sequence of object positions.
    - action: reconstruct_grid
      description: Create a new grid by placing the objects at the reversed positions, maintaining the original background color elsewhere.
relationship_between_examples:
  - common_rule: All examples follow the same rule of reversing the order of objects along a diagonal.
  - variations:
    - The specific shape and colors of the object differ between examples.
    - The direction of the diagonal (top-left to bottom-right vs. top-right to bottom-left) varies.
    - The number of objects varies.
    - The grid dimensions vary.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all distinct, connected groups of non-white pixels in the input grid. These are the "objects".
3.  Determine the shape (relative pixel coordinates and colors) and the primary anchor position (e.g., the top-left coordinate of the bounding box) for each identified object.
4.  Verify that all identified objects have the exact same shape. Store this unique object shape.
5.  Create a list of the anchor positions of all identified objects.
6.  Sort this list of positions based on their order along the diagonal path they form. (For a top-left to bottom-right diagonal, sort by row index then column index. For a top-right to bottom-left diagonal, sort by row index then reverse column index, or similar logic).
7.  Reverse the sorted list of anchor positions.
8.  Iterate through the *reversed* list of anchor positions. For each position in this reversed list:
    a.  Retrieve the unique object shape identified in step 4.
    b.  Place (draw) this object shape onto the output grid, using the current anchor position from the reversed list as the reference point (e.g., the top-left corner).
9.  Return the final output grid.
