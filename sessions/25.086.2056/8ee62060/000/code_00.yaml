task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    - background_color: The background is consistently white (0).
  elements:
    - type: object
      description: Small, contiguous patterns of non-white pixels.
      properties:
        - shape_consistency: All non-background objects within a single input grid have the identical shape and color composition.
        - arrangement: Objects are positioned along a diagonal line.
        - distinctness: Objects are spatially separated from each other.
  transformation:
    - action: identify_objects
      description: Locate all instances of the repeating non-white object and their positions (e.g., top-left corner).
    - action: determine_order
      description: Establish the sequence of objects along the diagonal path.
    - action: reverse_order
      description: Reverse the sequence of object positions.
    - action: reconstruct_grid
      description: Create a new grid by placing the objects at the reversed positions, maintaining the original background color elsewhere.
relationship_between_examples:
  - common_rule: All examples follow the same rule of reversing the order of objects along a diagonal.
  - variations:
    - The specific shape and colors of the object differ between examples.
    - The direction of the diagonal (top-left to bottom-right vs. top-right to bottom-left) varies.
    - The number of objects varies.
    - The grid dimensions vary.
