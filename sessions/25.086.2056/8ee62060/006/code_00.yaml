task_description: Reverses the sequence of repeating 2x2 patterns found along a path in the grid.

grid_properties:
  - size: Variable height and width (up to 30x30).
  - background_color: 0 (white).

objects:
  - name: pattern
    description: A 2x2 block of pixels identified starting from the top-leftmost non-background pixel in the input grid. This pattern includes any background (0) pixels within that 2x2 block.
    properties:
      - structure: Fixed 2x2 grid section.
      - color: Contains specific colors (e.g., red, green, blue, azure) and potentially background color (white).
  - name: pattern_instance
    description: An occurrence of the identified 2x2 pattern within the input grid.
    properties:
      - location: Defined by the top-left coordinate (anchor point) of the 2x2 block.
      - sequence_order: Determined by sorting anchor points first by row index, then by column index.

actions:
  - name: identify_base_pattern
    input: input_grid
    output: pattern_structure (2x2 grid), pattern_anchor (row, col)
    description: Find the top-leftmost non-background pixel. Define the pattern as the 2x2 block starting at this pixel's coordinates.
  - name: find_pattern_instances
    input: input_grid, pattern_structure
    output: list_of_anchors [(row, col)]
    description: Locate all positions in the input grid where the 2x2 block exactly matches the pattern_structure.
  - name: sort_instances
    input: list_of_anchors
    output: sorted_list_of_anchors
    description: Sort the identified anchor points based on their position (row first, then column).
  - name: reverse_sequence_placement
    input: sorted_list_of_anchors, pattern_structure, grid_dimensions
    output: output_grid
    description: >
      Create an empty output grid (filled with background color).
      Let N be the number of anchors in sorted_list_of_anchors.
      For each index i from 0 to N-1:
        Retrieve the source anchor point P_i = sorted_list_of_anchors[i].
        Determine the target anchor point P_target = sorted_list_of_anchors[N-1-i].
        Draw the pattern_structure onto the output grid starting at the P_target coordinates.

final_output: The output_grid containing the pattern instances placed in the reversed sequence order.
