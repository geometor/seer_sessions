            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided Python code attempts to solve the task by identifying a repeating 2x2 pattern, finding all its instances, sorting the locations (anchor points) of these instances, and then intending to place them back onto the output grid in the reverse order of their original sequence.\n\nHowever, the results clearly show that the `transformed_output` is identical to the `input` for all examples. This indicates a flaw in the final step where the patterns are placed onto the output grid. The code currently finds the correct pattern and its locations but redraws them in their original positions instead of the intended reversed sequence.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to correct the logic in step 6 of the `transform` function. Instead of iterating through the reversed list of anchor points and drawing at those points, the code should iterate through the original sorted sequence of anchor points and map the *i*-th pattern instance to the *(n-1-i)*-th position in the output grid, where *n* is the total number of pattern instances found.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nLet's verify the number of pattern instances and their locations for each example. The pattern is expected to be a 2x2 block, identified starting from the top-leftmost non-background pixel.\n\n"
