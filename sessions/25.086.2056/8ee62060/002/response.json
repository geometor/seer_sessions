            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code failed because it incorrectly identified the \"objects\" being manipulated. It treated any connected group of non-background pixels as a single object. However, the examples show that the repeating elements are specific *patterns* or *composite objects*, which may consist of multiple colors and even include background pixels within their structure (implicitly, by defining the pattern relative to an anchor).\n\nThe core transformation seems to be identifying these repeating patterns arranged along a primary diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and reversing their order along that same diagonal line in the output grid.\n\nThe strategy to resolve the errors is:\n1.  **Refine Object/Pattern Identification:** Develop a method to identify the *specific repeating pattern* rather than just connected non-background blobs. This pattern likely starts at the top-leftmost non-background pixel and has a characteristic shape and color arrangement.\n2.  **Locate Pattern Instances:** Find all occurrences of this exact pattern in the input grid, specifically focusing on locations consistent with a diagonal arrangement. Record the anchor point (e.g., top-left corner) of each instance.\n3.  **Reverse Positions:** Sort the identified anchor points based on their diagonal position (top-left to bottom-right).\n4.  **Reconstruct Output:** Create a new grid and place the identified pattern at the anchor points corresponding to the *reversed* order of the original positions.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the structure and positions in each example. We need to identify the repeating pattern and its anchor points.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 12x12\n*   Expected Output Grid Size: 12x12\n*   Pattern (relative to anchor): `{(0, 0): 2, (0, 1): 2, (1, 0): 3, (1, 1): 2}`\n*   Input Anchor Points (Row, Col): `(0, 10), (2, 8), (4, 6), (6, 4), (8, 2), (10, 0)`\n*   Expected Output Anchor Points (Row, Col): `(10, 0), (8, 2), (6, 4), (4, 6), (2, 8), (0, 10)`\n*   Observation: The anchor points are reversed. The pattern itself is unchanged.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 12x12\n*   Expected Output Grid Size: 12x12\n*   Pattern (relative to anchor): `{(0, 0): 8, (1, 0): 2, (1, 1): 2}`\n*   Input Anchor Points (Row, Col): `(0, 0), (2, 2), (4, 4), (6, 6), (8, 8), (10, 10)`\n*   Expected Output Anchor Points (Row, Col): `(10, 10), (8, 8), (6, 6), (4, 4), (2, 2), (0, 0)`\n*   Observation: The anchor points are reversed. The pattern itself is unchanged. The pattern includes an azure (8) pixel and two red (2) pixels.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 10x10\n*   Expected Output Grid Size: 10x10\n*   Pattern (relative to anchor): `{(0, 0): 2, (0, 1): 1, (1, 0): 1}` (Note: (1,1) is background/0)\n*   Input Anchor Points (Row, Col): `(0, 0), (2, 2), (4, 4), (6, 6), (8, 8)`\n*   Expected Output Anchor Points (Row, Col): `(8, 8), (6, 6), (4, 4), (2, 2), (0, 0)`\n*   Observation: The anchor points are reversed. The pattern itself is unchanged. The pattern includes red (2) and blue (1) pixels.\n\nThe pattern identification and anchor point reversal logic seems consistent across all examples. The previous code failed because `find_objects` merged adjacent non-background pixels into single objects instead of recognizing the distinct repeating patterns.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

This pixel's location `(first_r, first_c)` serves as the anchor for the first instance of the repeating pattern.\n3.  **Determine Pattern Structure**: Define the pattern by capturing the colors and relative positions `(dr, dc)` of a small region around the anchor `(first_r, first_c)`. The size of this region needs careful consideration (e.g., 2x2 or 3x3 seems sufficient for these examples, but a more robust method might compare potential patterns). Store this pattern as a set of `(dr, dc, color)` tuples, excluding background pixels within the pattern's bounding box if necessary (though Example 3 suggests the pattern definition *includes* the relative positions even if the pixel is background). A safer approach is to define the pattern based on the non-background pixels relative to the anchor. Let's refine: Determine the minimal bounding box containing all non-background pixels connected (8-way adjacency) to the `(first_r, first_c)` pixel *within a small local neighborhood* (this locality is tricky - maybe define the pattern by just the first few pixels?). **Alternative/Better Pattern Definition**: Assume the pattern is defined by the non-background pixels within a fixed-size bounding box (e.g., 2x2 or 3x3) originating at the anchor. Extract the relative coordinates `(dr, dc)` and colors of all *non-background* pixels within this box: `pattern = {(dr, dc): color}`.\n4.  **Identify All Instances**: Scan the input grid. At each cell `(r, c)`, check if the pattern defined in step 3 matches the grid content when anchored at `(r, c)`. Store all coordinates `(r, c)` where a match occurs. These are the `input_anchors`.\n5.  **Sort Anchors**: Sort the `input_anchors` list. The primary sort key is the row index, and the secondary sort key is the column index. This orders the patterns along the diagonal (from top-left towards bottom-right, or top-right towards bottom-left).\n6.  **Determine Output Anchors**: Create a `output_anchors` list by reversing the sorted `input_anchors` list.\n7.  **Draw Patterns**: Iterate through the `output_anchors` list. For each `anchor = (out_r, out_c)` in the list:\n    *   Retrieve the `pattern` definition `{(dr, dc): color}`.\n    *   For each `(dr, dc): color` in the pattern, calculate the target coordinates `(target_r, target_c) = (out_r + dr, out_c + dc)`.\n    *   If `(target_r, target_c)` is within the grid bounds, set the pixel value in the output grid: `output_grid[target_r, target_c] = color`.\n8.  **Return**: Return the completed output grid."
