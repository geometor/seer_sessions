            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code successfully identifies a repeating pattern (assumed to be 2x2 originating from the top-leftmost non-background pixel) and finds all its occurrences (instances) in the input grid. It correctly sorts the locations (anchor points) of these instances. However, the code failed to produce the correct output because it redrew the patterns at their *original* locations instead of mapping them to *new* locations based on the reversed order. The transformed output was identical to the input in all examples.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to:\n1.  Retain the logic for identifying the pattern and finding/sorting its anchor points in the input.\n2.  Modify the drawing step: Determine the sequence of *target* anchor points by reversing the sorted list of *input* anchor points.\n3.  Create a new, empty output grid.\n4.  Iterate through the sorted input anchors. For each input anchor at index `i`, draw the identified pattern at the target anchor position found at index `i` in the *reversed* list.\n\n**Metrics**\n"

The bounding box includes background pixels if they are necessary to distinguish the pattern from other arrangements.\n  - Instances: Multiple occurrences of the pattern exist in the input grid.\n\nPattern_Instances:\n  - Type: Collection of Anchor Points.\n  - Properties:\n    - Location: Each instance has a unique anchor point (row, column) in the input grid.\n    - Arrangement: Arranged linearly along a diagonal (either top-left to bottom-right or bottom-left to top-right).\n    - Order: Can be sequenced based on their position (e.g., sorted by row, then column).\n\nOutput_Grid:\n  - Type: 2D array of integers (pixels)\n  - Properties:\n    - Size: Same dimensions as the Input_Grid.\n    - Content: Contains the same Pattern instances as the Input_Grid, but placed at different locations.\n    - Background: Initially filled with the background color (0).\n\nTransformation:\n  - Action: Reordering\n  - Object: Pattern_Instances\n  - Rule: The sequence of Pattern_Instances found in the Input_Grid is reversed.\n  - Implementation:\n    1.

Create a list of Target Anchor Points by reversing the sorted list of Input Anchor Points.\n    5. Create an empty Output_Grid (filled with background color).\n    6. For each index `i` from 0 to N-1 (where N is the number of instances):\n       - Retrieve the Target Anchor Point at index `i` from the reversed list.\n       - Draw the identified Pattern onto the Output_Grid at this Target Anchor Point.\n```"

Scan the input grid row by row, then column by column, to find the coordinates (row `R`, column `C`) of the first non-background pixel encountered. This is the primary anchor.\n3.  Examine the 2x2 area starting at the primary anchor (`R`, `C`). Define the \"pattern\" as the set of relative coordinates (`dr`, `dc`) and colors of all non-background pixels within this 2x2 area, relative to the anchor (`dr`=0..1, `dc`=0..1). Record the bounding box size (height `H`, width `W`) required to contain these relative coordinates (in these examples, H=2, W=2).\n4.  Search the entire input grid to find all locations (anchor points `r`, `c`) where this exact pattern occurs. A match requires:\n    *   All non-background pixels defined in the pattern must match the colors at `(r+dr, c+dc)`.\n    *   All positions within the pattern's bounding box (`r` to `r+H-1`, `c` to `c+W-1`) that are *not* part of the pattern definition (i.e., were background in the original 2x2 sample) must correspond to background pixels (0) in the input grid.\n5.  Collect all matching anchor points found in the input grid into a list called `input_anchors`.\n6.  Sort the `input_anchors` list, primarily by row index and secondarily by column index.\n7.  Create a new list called `target_anchors` by reversing the order of the `sorted_input_anchors` list.\n8.  Iterate through the `sorted_input_anchors` list using an index `i` (from 0 to the number of anchors minus 1):\n    *   Get the `i`-th anchor point from the `target_anchors` list. Let this target anchor be (`target_r`, `target_c`).\n    *   For each relative coordinate (`dr`, `dc`) and color `value` in the pattern definition:\n        *   Set the pixel color at (`target_r + dr`, `target_c + dc`) in the output grid to `value`.\n9.  Return the completed output grid."
