"""
Reverses the sequence of repeating 2x2 patterns found along a path in the 
grid.

The transformation involves the following steps:
1. Identify the top-leftmost non-background pixel and define a 2x2 pattern 
   block starting from this pixel.
2. Find all occurrences (instances) of this exact 2x2 pattern in the input 
   grid.
3. Sort the locations (anchor points) of these instances by row, then column, 
   to determine their original sequence.
4. Create a new grid and place the pattern instances onto it, but in the 
   reverse order of their original sequence. The first pattern instance moves 
   to the last instance's location, the second to the second-to-last, and so on.
