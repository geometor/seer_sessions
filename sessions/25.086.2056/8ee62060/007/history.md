Identifies a repeating pattern, typically originating from the top-leftmost 
non-background pixel, assuming the pattern is contained within a small, fixed 
bounding box (e.g., 2x2) relative to an anchor point. Finds all occurrences

the identified pattern onto the output grid at the original anchor locations,

**General Assessment**

The provided Python code attempts to solve the task by identifying a repeating 2x2 pattern, finding all its instances, sorting the locations (anchor points) of these instances, and then intending to place them back onto the output grid in the reverse order of their original sequence.

However, the results clearly show that the `transformed_output` is identical to the `input` for all examples. This indicates a flaw in the final step where the patterns are placed onto the output grid. The code currently finds the correct pattern and its locations but redraws them in their original positions instead of the intended reversed sequence.

The strategy to resolve this is to correct the logic in step 6 of the `transform` function. Instead of iterating through the reversed list of anchor points and drawing at those points, the code should iterate through the original sorted sequence of anchor points and map the *i*-th pattern instance to the *(n-1-i)*-th position in the output grid, where *n* is the total number of pattern instances found.

**Metrics**

Let's verify the number of pattern instances and their locations for each example. The pattern is expected to be a 2x2 block, identified starting from the top-leftmost non-background pixel.

                # This seems overly complex. The current logic matches the full 2x2 block including 0s.
                # If the pattern derived from the first anchor IS [[0,0],[0,0]], no instances will be found anyway.

```
The metrics confirm:

*   **Example 1:** Pattern `[[2, 2], [3, 2]]` found at `(0, 10)`. 6 instances found, sorted anchors are `[(0, 10), (2, 8), (4, 6), (6, 4), (8, 2), (10, 0)]`.
*   **Example 2:** Pattern `[[8, 0], [2, 2]]` found at `(0, 0)`. 6 instances found, sorted anchors are `[(0, 0), (2, 2), (4, 4), (6, 6), (8, 8), (10, 10)]`.
*   **Example 3:** Pattern `[[2, 1], [1, 0]]` found at `(0, 0)`. 5 instances found, sorted anchors are `[(0, 0), (2, 2), (4, 4), (6, 6), (8, 8)]`.

The pattern identification and instance finding logic appear correct based on these metrics. The failure lies solely in the repositioning step.

    output: output_grid
    description: >
      Create an empty output grid (filled with background color).
      Let N be the number of anchors in sorted_list_of_anchors.
      For each index i from 0 to N-1:
        Retrieve the source anchor point P_i = sorted_list_of_anchors[i].
        Determine the target anchor point P_target = sorted_list_of_anchors[N-1-i].
        Draw the pattern_structure onto the output grid starting at the P_target coordinates.

final_output: The output_grid containing the pattern instances placed in the reversed sequence order.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (0).
2.  Identify the anchor coordinates (row, column) of the top-leftmost non-background pixel in the input grid. If no non-background pixels exist, return the empty output grid.
3.  Define the "pattern" as the 2x2 block of pixels in the input grid starting at the identified anchor coordinates. This includes any background pixels within that 2x2 block.
4.  Search the input grid and find all locations (anchor points) where this exact 2x2 pattern occurs. Store these anchor points as a list.
5.  Sort the list of found anchor points primarily by row index and secondarily by column index. Let this sorted list be `S`.
6.  Let `N` be the number of anchor points in the sorted list `S`.
7.  Iterate through the sorted list `S` using an index `i` from 0 to `N-1`.
8.  For each index `i`, determine the *target* anchor point by retrieving the element at index `N - 1 - i` from the sorted list `S`.
9.  Draw the identified 2x2 pattern onto the output grid, starting at the coordinates of the *target* anchor point determined in the previous step.
10. Return the final output grid.
