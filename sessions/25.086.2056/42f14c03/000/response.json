The input grids contain multiple shapes of various colors against a dominant background color. The output grid contains only a subset of these shapes, arranged within a minimal bounding box. The key challenge is determining the criteria for selecting which objects are kept. Two selection criteria seem apparent: 1) objects whose bounding box contains pixels of the input grid's background color, and 2) objects whose specific shape appears more than once in the input grid. The background color of the output grid seems determined by the color of the object selected based on the first criterion.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Count how many times each unique object shape appears in the input grid. Store this frequency for each object.\n    5.  Select objects to keep based on the following criteria: Keep an object if it `contains_background` OR if its shape frequency is greater than 1.\n    6.
