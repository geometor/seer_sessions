task_description: Reflect objects across a central blue line, swapping specific color pairs, and conditionally removing the original object based on the line's orientation.

elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: axis
    color: blue (1)
    shape: straight line (horizontal or vertical)
    role: acts as a mirror/axis of reflection
  - type: object
    location: entirely on one side of the blue axis
    composition: contiguous pixels of specific color pairs
    color_pairs:
      - [red (2), green (3)]
      - [yellow (4), azure (8)]
      - [gray (5), magenta (6)]

actions:
  - name: identify_axis
    input: input_grid
    output: blue line coordinates and orientation (horizontal/vertical)
  - name: identify_objects
    input: input_grid, axis_coordinates
    output: list of objects (pixel coordinates and colors) located on one side of the axis
  - name: reflect_object
    input: object, axis
    output: coordinates of the reflected object
    constraints:
      - reflection is geometric (horizontal reflection for vertical axis, vertical reflection for horizontal axis)
  - name: swap_colors
    input: reflected_object, color_pairs
    output: reflected_object with swapped colors (e.g., 2 becomes 3, 3 becomes 2; 4 becomes 8, 8 becomes 4; 5 becomes 6, 6 becomes 5)
  - name: place_reflection
    input: output_grid, color_swapped_reflection
    output: output_grid with the reflected object added
  - name: conditional_removal
    input: output_grid, original_object, axis_orientation
    output: output_grid
    condition: if axis is horizontal, replace original_object pixels with white (0)

relationships:
  - The blue line divides the grid into two regions.
  - Objects exist exclusively in one region relative to the blue line.
  - The transformation maps an object from one region to the other via reflection across the blue line.
  - Color transformation (swapping) is coupled with the spatial transformation (reflection).
  - The persistence or removal of the original object depends on the orientation of the blue line axis.

output_grid_composition:
  - Contains the original blue axis.
  - Contains the color-swapped reflection of the input object(s).
  - If the axis was vertical, it also contains the original object(s).
  - If the axis was horizontal, the area of the original object(s) is replaced with the background color (white).
  - Background pixels remain unchanged unless overwritten by a reflection or cleared due to original object removal.
