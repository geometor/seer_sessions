This line is either perfectly horizontal or perfectly vertical. It seems to act as a separator or an axis.\n2.  **Objects:** In each input grid, besides the blue line and the white (0) background, there is at least one distinct shape or object composed of other colors. These objects are located entirely on one side of the blue line.\n3.  **Color Pairs:** The objects are composed of specific color pairs:\n    *   Example 1: Azure (8) and Yellow (4)\n    *   Example 2: Red (2) and Green (3)\n    *   Example 3: Gray (5) and Magenta (6)\n4.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation appears to be a reflection of the object(s) across the blue line.\n5.  **Color Swapping:** During the reflection, the colors within the object are swapped according to the pairs identified above (8<->4, 2<->3, 5<->6).\n6.  **Conditional Removal:** A key difference is observed:\n    *   In Example 1 (vertical blue line), the original object remains in the output along with its reflection.\n    *   In Examples 2 and 3 (horizontal blue lines), the original object is *removed* (replaced by white pixels) in the output, leaving only the reflection.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
