task_description: Reflect objects across a blue axis, swapping specific colors on both the original and reflected sides.

definitions:
  grid: A 2D array of integers 0-9 representing colors.
  background: Color 0 (white).
  axis: A single continuous line (row or column) of color 1 (blue).
  object_pixel: Any pixel that is not background (0) and not part of the axis (1).
  color_swap_map:
    Red (2): Green (3)
    Green (3): Red (2)
    Yellow (4): Azure (8)
    Azure (8): Yellow (4)
    Gray (5): Magenta (6)
    Magenta (6): Gray (5)
    Other colors: Map to themselves (e.g., 0->0, 1->1, 7->7, 9->9).

transformation_steps:
  - description: Identify the blue axis.
    properties:
      - color: 1 (blue)
      - shape: A single full row or a single full column.
      - location: Store its orientation (horizontal/vertical) and index (row/column number).
  - description: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - description: Identify all object pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Not 0 and not 1.
      - location: Store their row and column coordinates (r, c).
  - description: Iterate through each identified object pixel.
    actions:
      - name: Determine the swapped color.
        input: Original color of the object pixel.
        using: color_swap_map.
        output: swapped_color.
      - name: Update the original pixel location.
        location: The original coordinates (r, c) of the object pixel.
        value: Set the pixel in the output grid at (r, c) to swapped_color.
      - name: Calculate the reflected coordinate.
        input: Original coordinates (r, c), axis orientation, axis index.
        output: Reflected coordinates (nr, nc).
        details:
          if horizontal axis at index `ax`: nr = ax + (ax - r), nc = c
          if vertical axis at index `ax`: nr = r, nc = ax + (ax - c)
      - name: Update the reflected pixel location.
        condition: The reflected coordinates (nr, nc) are within the grid bounds.
        location: The reflected coordinates (nr, nc).
        value: Set the pixel in the output grid at (nr, nc) to swapped_color.
  - description: Return the final output grid.
