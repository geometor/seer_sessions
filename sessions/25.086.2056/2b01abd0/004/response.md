**General Assessment**

The previous code correctly identified the blue axis, the reflection mechanism, and the color swap pairs (Red<->Green, Yellow<->Azure, Gray<->Magenta). However, it incorrectly assumed that the handling of the original object pixels depended on the axis orientation (removing originals for horizontal axes, swapping colors in place for vertical axes).

Reviewing the failed examples reveals a consistent pattern:
1.  **Example 1 (Vertical Axis):** The code correctly reflected the objects and applied the color swap (Azure<->Yellow) to the reflected pixels. However, it failed because the *original* object pixels also needed their colors swapped in place. The expected output shows swapped colors on *both* sides of the axis.
2.  **Example 2 & 3 (Horizontal Axis):** The code correctly reflected the objects and applied the color swaps (Red<->Green and Gray<->Magenta, respectively) to the reflected pixels. However, it failed because it erased the original object pixels (setting them to background color 0). The expected output shows that the original object pixels should also have their colors swapped in place, similar to the vertical axis case.

The core error is the conditional logic based on axis orientation for handling the original pixels. The correct rule appears to be consistent across both orientations: **swap the colors of the original pixels in place *and* place the swapped colors at the reflected positions.**

**Strategy:**
1.  Modify the code to remove the conditional logic (if horizontal vs. if vertical) that handles the original pixels differently.
2.  Implement the unified logic: iterate through the original object pixels, swap their color according to the map, update the output grid at the *original* position with the swapped color, calculate the reflected position, and if valid, update the output grid at the *reflected* position with the same swapped color.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid, which will become the output grid.
2.  Locate the single blue line (color 1) that spans the entire grid either horizontally or vertically. Record its orientation (horizontal or vertical) and its index (row or column number). If no such single line exists, return the original grid copy.
3.  Define the color swapping rules: Red (2) swaps with Green (3), Yellow (4) swaps with Azure (8), and Gray (5) swaps with Magenta (6). All other colors remain unchanged.
4.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are *not* background (color 0) and *not* part of the blue axis (color 1). These are the "object pixels". Store their original coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) and original color.
5.  For each identified object pixel:
    a.  Look up its original color in the color swapping rules to find its `swapped_color`.
    b.  Update the output grid at the object pixel's original coordinates (`r`, `c`) by setting it to the `swapped_color`.
    c.  Calculate the reflection coordinates (`nr`, `nc`) across the blue axis based on the original coordinates (`r`, `c`), the axis orientation, and the axis index.
    d.  Check if the calculated reflection coordinates (`nr`, `nc`) are within the bounds of the grid.
    e.  If the reflection coordinates are valid (within the grid), update the output grid at these coordinates (`nr`, `nc`) by setting it to the same `swapped_color`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
