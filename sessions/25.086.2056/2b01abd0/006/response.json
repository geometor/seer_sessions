However, it incorrectly applied the color swap to *both* the original object pixels and their reflections. The `Expected Output` grids consistently show that the original objects remain unchanged in color and position, while the reflected objects appear with the swapped colors. The strategy is to modify the logic to apply the color swap *only* to the reflected pixels, leaving the original object pixels untouched (aside from being potentially overwritten by a reflection).\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n"
