"""
Reflects objects across a central blue line (axis), swaps specific color pairs 
(Red<->Green, Yellow<->Azure, Gray<->Magenta) on both the original object 
pixels and their reflections.

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Find the single blue axis line (color 1), its orientation (horizontal/vertical), and index. If no single axis is found, return the copy.
3. Define color swap pairs: Red(2)<->Green(3), Yellow(4)<->Azure(8), Gray(5)<->Magenta(6). Other colors map to themselves.
4. Identify and store the coordinates and original colors of all non-background (0), non-axis (1) pixels ("object pixels").
5. Iterate through the identified original object pixels:
   a. Determine the swapped color based on the defined pairs.
   b. Update the output grid at the *original* pixel's coordinate with the swapped color.
   c. Calculate the reflection coordinate across the axis.
   d. If the reflection coordinate is within grid bounds, update the output grid at that coordinate with the *same* swapped color.
6. Return the modified output grid.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code correctly identified the core transformation elements: reflection across a single blue axis and specific color swaps (Red<->Green, Yellow<->Azure, Gray<->Magenta). However, it incorrectly applied the color swap to *both* the original object pixels and their reflections. The `Expected Output` grids consistently show that the original objects remain unchanged in color and position, while the reflected objects appear with the swapped colors. The strategy is to modify the logic to apply the color swap *only* to the reflected pixels, leaving the original object pixels untouched (aside from being potentially overwritten by a reflection).

**Analysis Summary:**

*   **Axis:** All examples have a single, complete blue (1) line, either horizontal or vertical, acting as the axis of reflection.
*   **Original Objects:** Consist of pixels with colors Red(2), Green(3), Yellow(4), Azure(8), Gray(5), or Magenta(6).
*   **Color Swaps:** The pairs Red<->Green, Yellow<->Azure, Gray<->Magenta are consistent across examples for the colors present.
*   **Error Confirmation:**
    *   The analysis confirms (`Original Pixels Preserved in Expected Output: False`) that the *expected* output grids *do not* preserve the original object pixel colors at their original locations if those locations are overwritten by the reflection. This point needs careful handling in the algorithm: the reflection takes precedence.
    *   The analysis confirms (`Original Pixels Incorrectly Swapped in Transformed Output: True`) that the previous code *did* incorrectly swap the colors of pixels at the original object locations, which is the primary source of error.
    *   The number of pixel differences corresponds exactly to the number of original object pixels in each example, reinforcing that the error lies in modifying the original positions incorrectly. The reflected positions were correctly calculated and colored (with the swapped color) by the previous code.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
task_description: Reflect objects across a blue axis and swap specific colors only in the reflection.

definitions:
  background_color: 0 (white)
  axis_color: 1 (blue)
  object_colors: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8] # Red, Green, Yellow, Gray, Magenta, Azure
  color_swap_pairs:
    - [2, 3] # Red <-> Green
    - [4, 8] # Yellow <-> Azure
    - [5, 6] # Gray <-> Magenta
  identity_colors: [0, 1, 7, 9] # Colors that are not part of swaps and not objects (except axis)

grid_properties:
  axis:
    - A single, complete line (row or column) of blue (1) pixels.
    - Defines the axis of reflection.
    - Can be horizontal or vertical.
  objects:
    - Contiguous or non-contiguous collections of pixels with colors from `object_colors`.
    - Located on one side of the axis.

transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Initialize output grid
    details: Create a copy of the input grid. This preserves background, axis, and original objects initially.
  - step: 2
    action: Identify axis
    details: Find the unique horizontal or vertical blue line. If none or multiple exist, the transformation might be undefined (though examples only show one).
  - step: 3
    action: Identify original object pixels
    details: Find all pixels that are not background (0) and not axis (1). Store their coordinates and original colors.
  - step: 4
    action: Perform reflection and color swap
    details: For each original object pixel identified in step 3
      - Calculate its reflected coordinate across the axis.
      - Determine the swapped color using the `color_swap_pairs`.
      - If the reflected coordinate is within the grid boundaries, update the output grid *at the reflected coordinate* with the *swapped* color. The original pixel's position in the output grid remains as copied initially unless overwritten by another pixel's reflection.

important_notes:
  - The colors of the *original* object pixels are *not* changed in the output grid, unless their position is overwritten by the reflection of another pixel.
  - The color swap is applied *only* to the pixels being placed at the reflected positions.
  - Reflections can overlap; the last write to a cell determines its final color.
  - Reflections landing outside the grid boundaries are ignored.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize:** Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  **Find Axis:** Locate the single, complete horizontal or vertical line of blue pixels (color 1). Determine its orientation (horizontal/vertical) and index (row or column number).
3.  **Define Swaps:** Establish the color transformation pairs: Red (2) swaps with Green (3), Yellow (4) swaps with Azure (8), and Gray (5) swaps with Magenta (6). All other colors map to themselves.
4.  **Identify & Reflect Objects:**
    a. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
    b. If a pixel is *not* background (color 0) and *not* part of the blue axis (color 1), consider it an "original object pixel".
    c. Calculate the coordinate where this pixel would land if reflected across the blue axis.
    d. Determine the color this pixel *would* have after the color swap (e.g., if the original pixel is Red (2), the swapped color is Green (3)).
    e. If the calculated reflected coordinate is within the bounds of the grid, update the pixel *at the reflected coordinate* in the *output grid* to the *swapped* color.
5.  **Return:** Output the modified grid. (Note: Step 4 inherently handles overwriting; original pixels remain unchanged unless their position is occupied by a reflected pixel).
