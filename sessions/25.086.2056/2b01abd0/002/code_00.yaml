task_description: Reflect objects across a central blue line, swap specific colors, and handle original objects based on line orientation.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous block of pixels with color other than white (0) or blue (1).
  - axis: A single, complete horizontal or vertical line of blue (1) pixels.
  - color_swap_pairs:
      - [Red(2), Green(3)]
      - [Yellow(4), Azure(8)]
      - [Gray(5), Magenta(6)]

transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify the blue axis line.
    constraints: Must be a single, complete horizontal or vertical line.
    properties: [orientation (horizontal/vertical), index (row/column number)]
  - step: 2
    action: Identify all non-background, non-axis pixels (original object pixels).
    properties: [location (row, col), color]
  - step: 3
    action: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: 4
    action: For each original object pixel:
      - Calculate its reflected coordinate across the axis.
      - Determine the swapped color using the color_swap_pairs.
      - If the reflected coordinate is within grid bounds, place the swapped color at that coordinate in the output grid.
  - step: 5
    condition: If the axis is vertical:
      action: For each original object pixel:
        - Determine the swapped color using the color_swap_pairs.
        - Update the pixel at the *original* location in the output grid with the swapped color.
    condition: If the axis is horizontal:
      action: For each original object pixel:
        - Set the pixel at the *original* location in the output grid to the background color (white/0).

input_output_mapping:
  - input_properties:
      - Vertical blue axis.
      - Objects on one side of the axis.
    output_properties:
      - Vertical blue axis remains.
      - Original objects remain but have their colors swapped.
      - Reflected objects appear on the other side with swapped colors.
  - input_properties:
      - Horizontal blue axis.
      - Objects on one side of the axis (either above or below).
    output_properties:
      - Horizontal blue axis remains.
      - Original objects are removed (set to white/0).
      - Reflected objects appear on the other side with swapped colors.
