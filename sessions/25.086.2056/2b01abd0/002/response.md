Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.

**General Assessment**

The previous code successfully identified the axis of reflection (blue line) and performed the reflection across it. It also correctly applied the color swapping rule {Red(2)<->Green(3), Yellow(4)<->Azure(8), Gray(5)<->Magenta(6)} to the *reflected* pixels.

However, there are consistent errors across the examples:

1.  **Example 1 (Vertical Axis):** The code failed because it only swapped the colors of the *reflected* pixels. The expected output shows that for a vertical axis, the colors of the *original* pixels should *also* be swapped. The original pixels themselves remain in place.
2.  **Examples 2 & 3 (Horizontal Axis):** The code failed because it did not *remove* the original objects after reflecting them. For a horizontal axis, the expected output shows the original object pixels being set to the background color (white/0), leaving only the reflected (and color-swapped) objects.

The pixel difference counts in the report (14, 14, 20) seem inconsistent with the visual differences observed (which appear to be 8, 7, and 10 respectively based on the logic errors). We should focus on correcting the logic based on the visual transformation rules, assuming the core issue lies in the implementation of the rules for original pixels after reflection.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  Modify the transformation logic to handle the original pixels differently based on the axis orientation:
    *   **Vertical Axis:** After placing the reflected, color-swapped pixels, iterate through the original object pixels again and update their colors in the output grid using the same color swap map.
    *   **Horizontal Axis:** The existing logic to remove original pixels needs to be debugged or revised to ensure it correctly sets the original object pixel locations to the background color (0) *after* the reflection is complete.

**Gather Metrics**

No code execution needed for this stage, analysis based on provided examples and results:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Axis: Vertical, index 6.
    *   Input Objects: Right side, colors Yellow (4) and Azure (8).
    *   Expected Action: Reflect left, swap colors (4->8, 8->4) on *both* left (reflected) and right (original) sides.
    *   Code Action: Reflected left, swapped colors only on the left side. Original colors on the right side were unchanged.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Axis: Horizontal, index 4.
    *   Input Objects: Above axis, colors Red (2) and Green (3).
    *   Expected Action: Reflect down, swap colors (2->3, 3->2) on the reflected side, remove original objects above axis.
    *   Code Action: Reflected down, swapped colors correctly on the reflected side, failed to remove original objects above axis.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Axis: Horizontal, index 8.
    *   Input Objects: Below axis, colors Gray (5) and Magenta (6).
    *   Expected Action: Reflect up, swap colors (5->6, 6->5) on the reflected side, remove original objects below axis.
    *   Code Action: Reflected up, swapped colors correctly on the reflected side, failed to remove original objects below axis.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous block of pixels with color other than white (0) or blue (1).
  - axis: A single, complete horizontal or vertical line of blue (1) pixels.

  - step: 4
    action: For each original object pixel:
      - Calculate its reflected coordinate across the axis.
      - Determine the swapped color using the color_swap_pairs.
      - If the reflected coordinate is within grid bounds, place the swapped color at that coordinate in the output grid.

      action: For each original object pixel:
        - Determine the swapped color using the color_swap_pairs.
        - Update the pixel at the *original* location in the output grid with the swapped color.
    condition: If the axis is horizontal:
      action: For each original object pixel:
        - Set the pixel at the *original* location in the output grid to the background color (white/0).

    output_properties:
      - Vertical blue axis remains.

      - Reflected objects appear on the other side with swapped colors.
  - input_properties:

      - Objects on one side of the axis (either above or below).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Locate the single blue line (color 1) that acts as the axis. Determine its orientation (horizontal or vertical) and its index (row or column number). If no such single line exists, return the original grid.
3.  Define the color swapping pairs: Red (2) <-> Green (3), Yellow (4) <-> Azure (8), Gray (5) <-> Magenta (6).
4.  Create a list of the coordinates and original colors of all pixels that are part of an object (i.e., not background color 0 and not axis color 1).
5.  **Reflection and Swapping:** Iterate through the recorded original object pixels:
    a. Calculate the reflection coordinate by mirroring the pixel's position across the identified axis.
    b. Find the corresponding swapped color using the defined pairs (if a color is not in a pair, it remains unchanged, though this doesn't occur in the examples).
    c. If the calculated reflection coordinate is within the grid boundaries, update the `output_grid` at the reflection coordinate with the swapped color.
6.  **Handle Original Pixels based on Axis Orientation:**
    a.  **If the axis is horizontal:** Iterate through the recorded original object pixel coordinates and set the color at each of these *original* coordinates in the `output_grid` to the background color (0).
    b.  **If the axis is vertical:** Iterate through the recorded original object pixel coordinates. For each pixel, find its swapped color using the defined pairs. Update the `output_grid` at the *original* coordinate with this swapped color.
7.  Return the modified `output_grid`.
