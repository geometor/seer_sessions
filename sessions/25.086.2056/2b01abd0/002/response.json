            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code successfully identified the axis of reflection (blue line) and performed the reflection across it. It also correctly applied the color swapping rule {Red(2)<->Green(3), Yellow(4)<->Azure(8), Gray(5)<->Magenta(6)} to the *reflected* pixels.\n\nHowever, there are consistent errors across the examples:\n\n1.  **Example 1 (Vertical Axis):** The code failed because it only swapped the colors of the *reflected* pixels. The expected output shows that for a vertical axis, the colors of the *original* pixels should *also* be swapped. The original pixels themselves remain in place.\n2.  **Examples 2 & 3 (Horizontal Axis):** The code failed because it did not *remove* the original objects after reflecting them. For a horizontal axis, the expected output shows the original object pixels being set to the background color (white/0), leaving only the reflected (and color-swapped) objects.\n\nThe pixel difference counts in the report (14, 14, 20) seem inconsistent with the visual differences observed (which appear to be 8, 7, and 10 respectively based on the logic errors). We should focus on correcting the logic based on the visual transformation rules, assuming the core issue lies in the implementation of the rules for original pixels after reflection.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Modify the transformation logic to handle the original pixels differently based on the axis orientation:\n    *   **Vertical Axis:** After placing the reflected, color-swapped pixels, iterate through the original object pixels again and update their colors in the output grid using the same color swap map.\n    *   **Horizontal Axis:** The existing logic to remove original pixels needs to be debugged or revised to ensure it correctly sets the original object pixel locations to the background color (0) *after* the reflection is complete.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n\nNo code execution needed for this stage, analysis based on provided examples and results:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Axis: Vertical, index 6.\n    *   Input Objects: Right side, colors Yellow (4) and Azure (8).\n    *   Expected Action: Reflect left, swap colors (4->8, 8->4) on *both* left (reflected) and right (original) sides.\n    *   Code Action: Reflected left, swapped colors only on the left side. Original colors on the right side were unchanged.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Axis: Horizontal, index 4.\n    *   Input Objects: Above axis, colors Red (2) and Green (3).\n    *   Expected Action: Reflect down, swap colors (2->3, 3->2) on the reflected side, remove original objects above axis.\n    *   Code Action: Reflected down, swapped colors correctly on the reflected side, failed to remove original objects above axis.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Axis: Horizontal, index 8.\n    *   Input Objects: Below axis, colors Gray (5) and Magenta (6).\n    *   Expected Action: Reflect up, swap colors (5->6, 6->5) on the reflected side, remove original objects below axis.\n    *   Code Action: Reflected up, swapped colors correctly on the reflected side, failed to remove original objects below axis.\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"
