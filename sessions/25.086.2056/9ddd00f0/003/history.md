**Refinement based on Metrics:**
The metrics confirm the key differentiator:
*   Example 1: `min_r = 3`, `min_r_is_zero = False`.
*   Example 2: `min_r = 0`, `min_r_is_zero = True`.

This strongly supports Hypothesis 2.

Note on Example 1 metrics: `min_c = 0`. The code finds the first *column* index is 0, because `input1[3,0]` is 8. However, visually, the pattern seems to start at column 1. Let's re-check input 1:

```
8 8 0 8 8  (Row 3)
0 8 0 8 0  (Row 4)
```

Ah, I misread it earlier. There IS an `8` in `input1[3,0]`. My earlier bounding box calculation was wrong. The correct bounding box is Rows 3-4, Cols 0-4. The `min_c` is indeed 0. This doesn't affect the logic for Hypothesis 2, as the action for Example 1 depends only on `min_r`.

Note on Example 2 metrics: `min_c = 4`. This confirms the pattern starts at column 4 and needs shifting left by 4.

**Final Check on Logic:**
The logic seems sound and correctly handles both provided examples based on whether the pattern touches the top row.

**YAML Facts Structure:**
- Identify Input Grid properties.
- Identify Pattern (non-background pixels).
- Pattern Properties (min/max row/col, colors, does it touch top row?).
- Transformation rule based on properties.
- Output Grid construction details.

**Natural Language Program Structure:**
- Describe the overall goal.
- Detail the steps, including the conditional logic based on `min_r`.
- Specify how to handle the case with no non-background pixels.
- Specify how to handle the case where `min_r == 0` but `min_c == 0`.## General Assessment

The provided code successfully implements a transformation rule derived from Example 1: identify the block of rows spanning the first to last non-background rows, flip this block vertically, and place it at the top of the output grid, overwriting the existing content.

However, this rule does not apply to Example 2. The comparison between the Input, Expected Output, and Transformed Output for Example 2 reveals that the code produced the input grid unchanged (or rather, it produced a vertically flipped version according to its logic, but the report showed the input instead; regardless, it was incorrect). The expected output for Example 2 involves a horizontal shift of the pattern to the left edge, not a vertical flip.

This indicates that the initial hypothesis based solely on Example 1 was incomplete. A new rule is needed that accommodates both examples.

## Strategy

1.  **Analyze Differences:** Identify key differences between the input grids and transformations in Example 1 and Example 2.
2.  **Formulate Conditional Hypothesis:** Develop a hypothesis where the transformation rule depends on specific properties of the input grid pattern. The key difference appears to be whether the pattern (non-background pixels) touches the top edge (row 0) of the grid.
3.  **Verify Hypothesis:** Test the new hypothesis against both examples.
4.  **Gather Metrics:** Use code execution to extract relevant properties from the input grids to confirm the conditional logic.
5.  **Document Findings:** Update the YAML facts and refine the natural language program based on the verified hypothesis.

## Metrics

Based on the code execution:

**Example 1 Input:**

```
{'dimensions': (5, 5), 'non_bg_pixels': 6, 'colors': {8}, 'min_r': 3, 'max_r': 4, 'min_c': 0, 'max_c': 4, 'bb_height': 2, 'bb_width': 5, 'min_r_is_zero': False}
```

- The pattern uses azure (8).
- The pattern starts at row 3 (`min_r=3`), not touching the top edge (`min_r_is_zero=False`).
- The rows containing the pattern are 3 and 4. The height of this row span is 2.

**Example 2 Input:**

```
{'dimensions': (11, 11), 'non_bg_pixels': 40, 'colors': {2}, 'min_r': 0, 'max_r': 10, 'min_c': 4, 'max_c': 10, 'bb_height': 11, 'bb_width': 7, 'min_r_is_zero': True}
```

- The pattern uses red (2).
- The pattern starts at row 0 (`min_r=0`), touching the top edge (`min_r_is_zero=True`).
- The pattern starts at column 4 (`min_c=4`).

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The property `min_r_is_zero` successfully distinguishes between the two examples and correlates with the different transformations observed (vertical flip/placement vs. horizontal shift).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze the Input Grid:** Check if the input grid contains any non-background pixels (pixels with value != 0).
    *   If no non-background pixels exist, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  **Identify Pattern Position:** Determine the minimum row index (`min_r`) and minimum column index (`min_c`) containing any non-background pixel.
3.  **Apply Conditional Transformation:**
    *   **Case 1: Pattern does not touch the top edge (`min_r > 0`)**
        a.  Find the maximum row index (`max_r`) containing a non-background pixel.
        b.  Calculate the height of the pattern's row span: `h = max_r - min_r + 1`.
        c.  Extract the block of rows from the input grid spanning `min_r` to `max_r` (inclusive).
        d.  Create a new block by vertically flipping the extracted block.
        e.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
        f.  Replace the top `h` rows of the output grid (rows 0 to `h-1`) with the flipped block.
    *   **Case 2: Pattern touches the top edge (`min_r == 0`)**
        a.  Check if the pattern is already aligned to the left edge (`min_c == 0`). If yes, return the input grid unchanged.
        b.  If not left-aligned (`min_c > 0`), create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (0).
        c.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid. If the input pixel `input[r, c]` is not the background color, copy its value to the output grid at position `(r, c - min_c)`. This effectively shifts the entire pattern left by `min_c` columns.
4.  **Return the Output Grid:** Return the resulting transformed grid.
