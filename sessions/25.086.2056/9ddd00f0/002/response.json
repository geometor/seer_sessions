The code finds the first *column* index is 0, because `input1[3,0]` is 8. However, visually, the pattern seems to start at column 1. Let's re-check input 1:\n"

The `min_c` is indeed 0. This doesn't affect the logic for Hypothesis 2, as the action for Example 1 depends only on `min_r`.\n\nNote on Example 2 metrics: `min_c = 4`. This confirms the pattern starts at column 4 and needs shifting left by 4.\n\n**Final Check on Logic:**\nThe logic seems sound and correctly handles both provided examples based on whether the pattern touches the top row.\n\n**YAML Facts Structure:**\n- Identify Input Grid properties.\n- Identify Pattern (non-background pixels).\n- Pattern Properties (min/max row/col, colors, does it touch top row?).\n- Transformation rule based on properties.\n- Output Grid construction details.\n\n**Natural Language Program Structure:**\n- Describe the overall goal.\n- Detail the steps, including the conditional logic based on `min_r`.\n- Specify how to handle the case with no non-background pixels.\n- Specify how to handle the case where `min_r == 0` but `min_c == 0`.## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code successfully implements a transformation rule derived from Example 1: identify the block of rows spanning the first to last non-background rows, flip this block vertically, and place it at the top of the output grid, overwriting the existing content.\n\nHowever, this rule does not apply to Example 2. The comparison between the Input, Expected Output, and Transformed Output for Example 2 reveals that the code produced the input grid unchanged (or rather, it produced a vertically flipped version according to its logic, but the report showed the input instead; regardless, it was incorrect). The expected output for Example 2 involves a horizontal shift of the pattern to the left edge, not a vertical flip.\n\nThis indicates that the initial hypothesis based solely on Example 1 was incomplete. A new rule is needed that accommodates both examples.\n\n## Strategy\n\n1.  **Analyze Differences:** Identify key differences between the input grids and transformations in Example 1 and Example 2.\n2.  **Formulate Conditional Hypothesis:** Develop a hypothesis where the transformation rule depends on specific properties of the input grid pattern. The key difference appears to be whether the pattern (non-background pixels) touches the top edge (row 0) of the grid.\n3.  **Verify Hypothesis:** Test the new hypothesis against both examples.\n4.  **Gather Metrics:** Use code execution to extract relevant properties from the input grids to confirm the conditional logic.\n5.  **Document Findings:** Update the YAML facts and refine the natural language program based on the verified hypothesis.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the code execution:\n\n**Example 1 Input:**\n"
