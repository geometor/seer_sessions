"""
Identify the largest contiguous non-background object in the input grid.
Determine its bounding box.
Find all pairs of orthogonally adjacent non-background colors outside this bounding box.
These pairs define a color transformation map: if color A is adjacent to color B, then color B maps to color A.
Extract the subgrid corresponding to the largest object's bounding box.
Apply the color transformation map to every pixel within this extracted subgrid.
Pixels whose colors are not in the 'B' side of the map retain their original color.
The transformed subgrid is the output.
