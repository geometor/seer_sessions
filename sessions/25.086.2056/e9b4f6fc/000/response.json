This object appears to be the primary focus.\n    *   train_1: Azure(8) frame.\n    *   train_2: Green(3) frame.\n    *   train_3: Blue(1) frame (L-shape).\n    *   train_4: Azure(8) frame.\n3.  **Scattered Elements:** Outside the main object, there are several small, isolated groups of 1 or 2 non-background pixels. Crucially, some of these pixels are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to each other, forming color pairs.\n    *   train_1: Adjacent pairs (Blue(1), Yellow(4)) and (Green(3), Red(2)).\n    *   train_2: Adjacent pairs (Magenta(6), Azure(8)), (Red(2), Blue(1)), (Yellow(4), Gray(5)).\n    *   train_3: Adjacent pairs (Red(2), Yellow(4)) and (Green(3), Azure(8)). Note: Blue(1) and Yellow(4) are present but *not* adjacent.\n    *   train_4: Adjacent pairs (Red(2), Green(3)) and (Blue(1), Yellow(4)).\n4.  **Output Grids:** The output grids are smaller and correspond in size and shape to the bounding box of the main object identified in the input. The content of the output grid is derived from the content within the main object's bounding box in the input, but with color transformations applied.\n5.  **Color Transformation:** The colors *inside* the main object (including its frame) in the input are systematically changed to produce the output. The rule for this change seems to be defined by the adjacent color pairs found scattered outside the main object. If color `A` is adjacent to color `B` in a scattered pair, then color `B` within the main object transforms into color `A` in the output. Colors within the main object that do not participate in such a mapping (either as the source `B` or are not found in any scattered pair) retain their original color in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
