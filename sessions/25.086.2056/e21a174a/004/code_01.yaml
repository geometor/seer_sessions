facts:
  - Rationale: "Identify the basic components and their arrangement."
    content:
      - description: "The input grid consists of horizontal segments."
      - description: "Segments are either single rows composed entirely of the background color (white, 0) or contiguous blocks of rows containing non-background colors."
        definition: "Separator Row: A row where all pixels are background color (0)."
        definition: "Object Block: A maximal contiguous sequence of one or more rows where no row is a Separator Row."
      - description: "The grid can be parsed vertically into an ordered sequence of these units (Separator Rows and Object Blocks)."

  - Rationale: "Describe the transformation process step-by-step."
    content:
      - description: "The primary transformation involves reversing the vertical order of the identified units (Separator Rows and Object Blocks)."
        action: "Identify all units in the input grid from top to bottom."
        action: "Create a new sequence containing these units in reverse order."
      - description: "A secondary transformation occurs within Object Blocks that span multiple rows."
        action: "For each unit in the reversed sequence:"
        condition: "If the unit is an Object Block (originally containing one or more rows):"
        action: "Reverse the top-to-bottom order of the rows *within* that Object Block."
        condition: "If the unit is a Separator Row:"
        action: "Keep the Separator Row as is."
      - description: "The final output grid is constructed by concatenating the processed units in their new order."
        action: "Combine the (potentially internally-reversed) units sequentially to form the output grid."

  - Rationale: "Acknowledge potential issues or edge cases implied by the errors."
    content:
      - description: "The implementation failed on all examples with a NumPy boolean ambiguity error."
      - hypothesis: "This might indicate an issue handling specific data patterns (e.g., empty rows/blocks, specific color combinations) or a bug in conditional logic involving NumPy arrays."
      - hypothesis: "The method for distinguishing Object Blocks from Separator Rows in the implementation might be flawed."
