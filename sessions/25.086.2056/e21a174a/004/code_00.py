    # Need to handle empty block possibility? unit = [[]]. isinstance([], list) is True. unit[0] fails.

        # ARC grids shouldn't contain empty rows, but defensively...
        # If unit[0] is [] (an empty row), isinstance([], list) is True.

    # A more robust check: Does the unit contain lists as elements?
    is_block = any(isinstance(row, list) for row in unit) if unit else False
    # No, this isn't right. A separator [0, 0] has no list elements. A block [[1]] has one list element [1].
    # Let's trust the structure from identify_units and the original check,
    # but assume the error source is subtle.

    # Sticking with the original check's intent:
    if unit and isinstance(unit[0], list):
        # OBJECT BLOCK
        object_block: ObjectBlock = unit
        flipped_block_rows = object_block[::-1]
        output_grid.extend(flipped_block_rows)
    elif unit: # Check if unit is non-empty (it should be a separator row)
        # SEPARATOR ROW
        separator_row: GridRow = unit
        output_grid.append(separator_row)
    # Implicitly handles unit being [] by doing nothing, which might be wrong.
    # If identify_units produced [], it should probably be appended if it was a separator.

# Let's refine identify_units to perhaps return a tuple (type, data)
# Or, let's assume identify_units is correct and the check in transform needs fixing.

# Consider the error occurred in Ex1, Ex2, Ex3. This means the base logic derived
# from Ex1 doesn't generalize or the implementation is buggy.

# Let's re-examine the task visually if possible (can't do that here).
# Assume the task is: Flip the grid vertically, but treat contiguous non-background rows as blocks that are flipped *internally* as well.

# Revised check in transform:
if isinstance(unit, list) and unit and isinstance(unit[0], list):
    # It's definitely a non-empty ObjectBlock List[List[int]]
    object_block = unit
    output_grid.extend(object_block[::-1])
elif isinstance(unit, list):
    # It's a GridRow List[int] (potentially empty, e.g. [])
    separator_row = unit
    output_grid.append(separator_row)
else:
    # Should not happen if identify_units returns List[Unit]
    pass

# This still feels like it should work. The error's source remains elusive based only on the code and error message.
# Let's proceed assuming the natural language description is mostly correct but needs refinement based on other examples, and the code needs debugging.
