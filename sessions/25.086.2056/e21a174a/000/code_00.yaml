Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: Input and output grids have identical height and width.
    - background_color: Primarily white (0).
Transformation:
  Type: Geometric Reflection
  Axis: Horizontal (Vertical Flip)
  Details:
    - The order of the rows in the input grid is reversed to produce the output grid.
    - Row `i` (0-indexed) in the input becomes row `height - 1 - i` in the output.
    - The content (pixel colors and their horizontal positions) within each row is preserved during the row reordering.
    - All pixels, regardless of color, are subject to this row reordering.
