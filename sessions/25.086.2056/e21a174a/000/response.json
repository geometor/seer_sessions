The specific colors used vary between examples (blue, red, green in train_1; blue, red, green, yellow, gray in train_2; azure, red, green, blue, yellow in train_3).\n3.  **Structure:** The colored pixels in the input grids form distinct shapes or horizontal segments. These shapes are located at various vertical positions within the grid.\n4.  **Transformation:** Comparing the input and output grids, the arrangement of the colored pixels appears to be vertically flipped or reflected. The top rows of the input become the bottom rows of the output, and vice versa. The horizontal positions of the pixels within each row remain unchanged. The background color (white) remains in its original position relative to the grid boundaries if it extends to the edges, or flips along with the content if it's part of the main pattern area.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
