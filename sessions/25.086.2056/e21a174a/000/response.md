Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Each example pair consists of an input grid and an output grid of the same dimensions.
2.  **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of various colors, primarily against a white (0) background. The specific colors used vary between examples (blue, red, green in train_1; blue, red, green, yellow, gray in train_2; azure, red, green, blue, yellow in train_3).
3.  **Structure:** The colored pixels in the input grids form distinct shapes or horizontal segments. These shapes are located at various vertical positions within the grid.
4.  **Transformation:** Comparing the input and output grids, the arrangement of the colored pixels appears to be vertically flipped or reflected. The top rows of the input become the bottom rows of the output, and vice versa. The horizontal positions of the pixels within each row remain unchanged. The background color (white) remains in its original position relative to the grid boundaries if it extends to the edges, or flips along with the content if it's part of the main pattern area.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: Input and output grids have identical height and width.
    - background_color: Primarily white (0).
Transformation:
  Type: Geometric Reflection
  Axis: Horizontal (Vertical Flip)
  Details:
    - The order of the rows in the input grid is reversed to produce the output grid.
    - Row `i` (0-indexed) in the input becomes row `height - 1 - i` in the output.
    - The content (pixel colors and their horizontal positions) within each row is preserved during the row reordering.
    - All pixels, regardless of color, are subject to this row reordering.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input grid.
2.  Reverse the order of the rows. The first row becomes the last, the second row becomes the second-to-last, and so on, until the last row becomes the first.
3.  The resulting grid with the reordered rows is the output grid.
