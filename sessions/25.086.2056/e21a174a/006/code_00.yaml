Task_Structure:
  Input_Type: Grid (2D array of integers/colors)
  Output_Type: Grid (2D array of integers/colors)
  Background_Color: white (0)

Identified_Elements:
  - Element: Separator_Row
    Definition: A single row in the grid where all pixels are the background color (white, 0).
    Properties:
      - horizontal
      - uniform_color (white)
  - Element: Object_Block
    Definition: A maximal contiguous sequence of one or more rows where no row is a Separator_Row.
    Properties:
      - horizontal_grouping
      - contains_non_background_colors
      - can_have_multiple_rows
  - Element: Unit
    Definition: A collective term for either a single Separator_Row or a single Object_Block.

Observed_Transformations:
  - Action: Segmentation
    Input: Input Grid
    Output: Ordered sequence of Units (Separator_Rows and Object_Blocks)
    Process: Scan grid top-to-bottom, identifying maximal segments based on the definitions of Separator_Row and Object_Block.
  - Action: Unit_Reversal
    Input: Ordered sequence of Units
    Output: Sequence of Units in reverse order.
  - Action: Block_Flipping
    Input: An Object_Block (sequence of rows)
    Output: The Object_Block with its rows in reverse order (internal vertical flip).
    Condition: Applied only to Units identified as Object_Blocks.
  - Action: Reconstruction
    Input: Reversed sequence of processed Units (Separator_Rows unchanged, Object_Blocks internally flipped)
    Output: Output Grid
    Process: Concatenate the Units vertically in their new order.

Inferred_Rule_Components:
  - Identify horizontal segments based on the presence/absence of all-white rows.
  - Reverse the vertical order of these identified segments.
  - Apply an internal vertical flip to the segments that are not all-white rows.
