task_description: Copy a pattern from a source block onto a target block within a grid.

definitions:
  - &grid_input The input 2D array of integers (colors).
  - &grid_output The output 2D array of integers (colors).
  - &white_block
    type: object
    description: A solid rectangular block composed entirely of white (0) pixels.
    properties:
      color: 0
      shape: rectangle
      solid: true
  - &pattern_block
    type: object
    description: A rectangular block used as the source pattern.
    properties:
      shape: rectangle
      solid: false # Usually contains multiple colors
      contains_white: false
  - &background_color
    type: property
    description: The single color of the pixels immediately adjacent to the outer border of both the white_block and the pattern_block. This color is not white.

grid_elements:
  - <<: *white_block
    location: Unique location within the grid_input.
    role: Target area for the copy operation.
  - <<: *pattern_block
    location: Unique location within the grid_input, different from white_block location.
    role: Source area for the copy operation.
    relationship:
      - type: size_match
        target: *white_block
        details: Has the exact same height and width as the white_block.
      - type: background_match
        target: *white_block
        details: Is surrounded by the same background_color as the white_block.

actions:
  - name: identify_white_block
    description: Locate the unique solid white rectangular block in the grid_input. Determine its bounding box (row, col, height, width).
  - name: identify_background_color
    description: Determine the single color surrounding the identified white_block. Check pixels adjacent to its bounding box.
  - name: identify_pattern_block
    description: >
      Search the grid_input for a rectangular block that:
      1. Has the same height and width as the white_block.
      2. Is not the white_block itself.
      3. Contains no white (0) pixels.
      4. Is surrounded by the same background_color identified previously.
      Assume exactly one such block exists. Determine its bounding box.
  - name: copy_pattern
    description: Create the grid_output by copying the grid_input, then replacing the area defined by the white_block's bounding box with the content of the area defined by the pattern_block's bounding box.

assumptions:
  - There is exactly one solid white rectangular block in the input.
  - There is exactly one pattern block matching the criteria (same dimensions, no white, same background border color) in the input.
  - The pixels immediately surrounding the white block are all of the same, non-white color.
  - The pixels immediately surrounding the pattern block are all of the same color, and this color matches the white block's surrounding color.
