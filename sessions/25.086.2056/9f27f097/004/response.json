            "text": "**Metric Analysis:**\n\n1.  **White Block:** In all examples, there is exactly one solid white rectangular block. Its properties are correctly identified by `get_block_properties`.\n2.  **Pattern Block (Intended):** In all examples, the intended pattern block (identified visually from the expected output) has the *exact same dimensions* as the white block. It does *not* contain white pixels. It is *not* a solid block of a single color.\n3.  **Dimensions Match:** The dimensions of the white block and the intended pattern block match in all examples.\n4.  **Other Non-White Blocks:** The code execution confirms that scanning the grid finds *many* rectangular regions that match the dimensions of the white block and do not contain white. The previous code's logic of picking the *first* one found (often the top-left block of background color) was incorrect.\n5.  **Uniqueness:** In each example, the *intended* pattern block appears to be the *only* block of the correct dimensions that contains multiple colors (i.e., is not solid) and does not contain white. Let's re-check the \"Other Non-White Blocks\" output.\n    *   Ex 1: White block 5x5. Intended pattern at (6,1) has colors [1, 4]. The block at (0,0) has [2]. Block at (2,0) has [1, 2, 4]. Block at (5,1) has [1, 2, 4]. Block at (5,5) has [1, 2, 4]. Okay, the uniqueness based on *not being solid* might not hold. What makes the intended pattern block unique?\n    *   Could it be the block with the most unique colors?\n        *   Ex 1: Pattern(6,1) -> [1, 4] (2 colors). Block(2,0) -> [1, 2, 4] (3 colors). No.\n    *   Could it be related to position?\n        *   Ex 1: White (0,5), Pattern (6,1).\n        *   Ex 2: White (7,4), Pattern (1,1).\n        *   Ex 3: White (8,3), Pattern (2,1).\n        No obvious positional relationship.\n    *   Let's look at the surrounding pixels. Are these blocks perhaps bounded by a specific color?\n        *   Ex 1: White block is surrounded by red (2). Pattern block is surrounded by red (2).\n        *   Ex 2: White block is surrounded by red (2). Pattern block is surrounded by red (2).\n        *   Ex 3: White block is surrounded by blue (1). Pattern block is surrounded by blue (1).\n        This seems promising! The white block and the pattern block are both enclosed within a larger area of a single, non-white color (which acts as the background/border color for these objects).\n\n**Revised Hypothesis 2:**\n1.  Identify the unique solid white (color 0) rectangular block. Let its dimensions be HxW and its location be (wr, wc).\n2.  Find the bounding box of the white block. Check the color of the pixels immediately adjacent (N, S, E, W) to this bounding box. Assume these adjacent pixels share a single, common color (the 'border' color, C_border). C_border must not be white.\n3.  Search the *entire* grid for *another* rectangular region of size HxW that:\n    *   Is located at (pr, pc), where (pr, pc) is not equal to (wr, wc).\n    *   Does *not* contain any white pixels (color 0).\n    *   Is also \"bordered\" by the *same* color C_border found in step 2. (Check pixels adjacent to the HxW region at (pr, pc)).\n4.  Assume there is exactly one such \"pattern\" region.\n5.  Copy the contents of this unique pattern region onto the location (wr, wc) in the output grid.\n\nLet's test this revised hypothesis.\n\n*   **Example 1:** White block (0,5, 5x5). Border color is red (2). Search for another 5x5 block bordered by red (2), containing no white (0). The block at (6,1, 5x5) fits this description. It contains colors [1, 4]. It is bordered by red (2).\n*   **Example 2:** White block (7,4, 4x4). Border color is red (2). Search for another 4x4 block bordered by red (2), containing no white (0). The block at (1,1, 4x4) fits this description. It contains colors [1, 3]. It is bordered by red (2).\n*   **Example 3:** White block (8,3, 4x6). Border color is blue (1). Search for another 4x6 block bordered by blue (1), containing no white (0). The block at (2,1, 4x6) fits this description. It contains colors [2, 3]. It is bordered by blue (1).\n\nThis hypothesis seems consistent with all examples. The \"border\" color acts as a key to link the white block and the pattern block.\n\n---\n\n## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code failed because it incorrectly identified the \"pattern\" block. It assumed the pattern block was the first block found matching the white block's dimensions and not containing white pixels. The analysis of all examples reveals a more specific rule:\n\n1.  Both the white block (target) and the pattern block (source) are rectangular and have the *exact same dimensions*.\n2.  The white block is solid white (color 0).\n3.  The pattern block contains *no* white pixels.\n4.  Crucially, both the white block and the pattern block are immediately surrounded by pixels of the *same* single background color (which is not white). This background color serves to identify the correct pattern block among potentially many non-white blocks of the correct size.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Find the solid white block and determine its dimensions and location.\n2.  Identify the color of the pixels immediately surrounding the white block (assuming it's a single, non-white color).\n3.  Iterate through all possible block locations in the grid.\n4.  For each location, check if a block of the same dimensions as the white block exists there.\n5.  If it exists, check if it contains white pixels.\n6.  If it doesn't contain white, check if it is surrounded by the *same* background color identified in step 2.\n7.  If all conditions are met, this is the pattern block.\n8.  Copy the pattern block's content to the white block's location in the output grid.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics gathered via `tool_code` execution confirm:\n*   A single, solid white rectangle exists in each input.\n*   A corresponding \"pattern\" rectangle exists with identical dimensions.\n*   This pattern rectangle contains no white pixels.\n*   The pattern rectangle is typically multi-colored (not solid).\n*   There are often multiple rectangular regions matching the dimensions and non-white criteria, necessitating a more specific selection rule.\n*   Visual inspection (and the revised hypothesis) suggests the surrounding background color is the key differentiator.\n\n## Facts YAML\n\n"

This led to incorrect blocks (often uniform background-colored areas) being selected.\n\nAnalysis of all three examples reveals a more nuanced relationship between the target white block and the source pattern block:\n1.  **Target:** A unique, solid white (color 0) rectangle exists.\n2.  **Source:** A unique rectangle (the \"pattern block\") exists with the *exact same dimensions* as the white block.\n3.  **Source Content:** The pattern block contains *no* white pixels but typically contains multiple other colors.\n4.  **Linking Feature:** Both the white block and the pattern block are immediately surrounded by pixels of the *same* single, non-white background/border color. This shared border color appears to be the key identifier for the correct pattern block.\n\nThe strategy requires refining the search for the pattern block to include the border color constraint:\n1.  Find the white block and its dimensions.\n2.  Determine the color surrounding the white block.\n3.  Search for a block with the same dimensions, no white content, *and* the same surrounding border color.\n4.  Copy this correctly identified pattern onto the white block's location.\n\n## Metrics\n\nCode execution and analysis confirm the following properties across the examples:\n*   **White Block:** Consistently a single, solid (all color 0) rectangle.\n*   **Pattern Block:**\n    *   Dimensions always match the white block exactly.\n    *   Never contains white (color 0) pixels.\n    *   Usually contains multiple different colors (is not solid).\n*   **Border Color:** Visual inspection and the revised hypothesis strongly suggest both the white block and the intended pattern block share the same single, non-white surrounding color in each example (Red=2 in Ex1/Ex2, Blue=1 in Ex3).\n*   **Ambiguity:** Simply searching for non-white blocks of the correct size yields many candidates, highlighting the failure of the original code and the necessity of the border color constraint.\n\n## Facts YAML\n\n"
