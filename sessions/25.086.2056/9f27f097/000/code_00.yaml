- task: Identify and replace a block of white pixels.
- objects:
    - name: background
      property: Most frequent color in the grid, excluding white (0). Remains unchanged.
    - name: white_block
      property: A contiguous rectangular block of white (0) pixels.
      property: Acts as the destination area for the transformation.
      property: Its dimensions (height, width) are important.
    - name: pattern_block
      property: A contiguous rectangular block containing pixels that are not white (0) and not the background color.
      property: Has the exact same dimensions (height, width) as the white_block.
      property: Acts as the source of the pattern to be copied.
      property: Its original location remains unchanged in the output.
- transformation:
    - action: find_bounding_box
      input: input_grid
      target: white_block
      output: white_bbox (top_row, left_col, height, width)
    - action: find_matching_block
      input: input_grid
      criteria:
        - dimensions must match white_bbox (height, width)
        - must not contain white (0) pixels
        - must not contain only background pixels
        - must be distinct from the white_block's location
      output: pattern_bbox (top_row, left_col, height, width)
    - action: copy_paste
      source_grid: input_grid
      source_bbox: pattern_bbox
      destination_grid: output_grid (initially a copy of input_grid)
      destination_bbox: white_bbox
      details: For each relative offset (dr, dc) from 0 to height-1 and 0 to width-1, the pixel at (white_bbox.top_row + dr, white_bbox.left_col + dc) in the output_grid is set to the value of the pixel at (pattern_bbox.top_row + dr, pattern_bbox.left_col + dc) in the input_grid.
