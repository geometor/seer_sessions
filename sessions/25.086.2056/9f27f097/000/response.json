There's a large background area filled with a single color (Red in train_1 and train_2, Blue in train_3).\n2.  **Key Objects:**\n    *   **White Block (Color 0):** A rectangular block composed entirely of white pixels. Its size and position vary between examples.\n    *   **Pattern Block:** Another rectangular block of the *same dimensions* as the White Block, located elsewhere in the grid. This block contains a pattern made of colors other than white and the main background color.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core operation appears to be a \"copy-paste\". The pixel pattern within the Pattern Block is copied directly onto the location of the White Block in the output grid.\n4.  **Invariance:** The rest of the grid, including the background and the original Pattern Block, remains unchanged in the output.\n5.  **Relationship:** The White Block acts as a target or destination area, and the Pattern Block acts as the source of the pixel data to fill that area. The dimensions of these two blocks must match for the operation to be defined as observed.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
