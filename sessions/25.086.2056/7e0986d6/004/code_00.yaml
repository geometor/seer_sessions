background_color: 0 (white)
relevant_colors_property: non-background colors present in the input grid.
object_definition: A group of connected pixels of the same non-background color. Connectivity is 4-directional (sharing an edge).
object_property_measured: Size (number of pixels in the object).
selection_criterion:
  - For each distinct non-background color, find the minimum size among all objects of that color.
  - Identify the color(s) associated with the overall minimum object size found across all colors.
tie_breaking_rule: If multiple colors share the overall minimum object size, select the color with the lowest numerical value.
action:
  - Identify the single target color based on the selection criterion and tie-breaking rule.
  - Replace *all* pixels in the grid having the target color with the background color (0).
output_grid_property: Same dimensions as the input grid. Contains original pixels except for those matching the target color, which are replaced by the background color.
edge_case_handling:
  - If no non-background colors exist, the grid remains unchanged.
  - If only one non-background color exists, it is automatically the target color (as its min object size is the overall min), and all its pixels are replaced by the background color. # Correction from previous code comment: Even one color needs processing.
