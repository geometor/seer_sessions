task_description: Identify the non-background color associated with the smallest connected object and replace all instances of that color with the background color.
background_color: 0 (white)
object_definition: A contiguous group of pixels of the same non-background color.
connectivity: 4-directional (up, down, left, right neighbours). Diagonal neighbours are not considered connected.
object_property: Size (count of pixels in the object).
analysis_steps:
  - Find all unique non-background colors in the input grid.
  - For each non-background color:
    - Identify all distinct connected objects of that color.
    - Calculate the size of each object.
    - Determine the minimum object size found for that color.
selection_criterion:
  - Find the overall minimum object size across all non-background colors.
  - Identify the color(s) having this minimum object size.
tie_breaking: If multiple colors share the overall minimum object size, select the color with the lowest numerical value.
action:
  - Define the color selected by the criterion and tie-breaking as the 'target color'.
  - Replace every pixel in the grid matching the 'target color' with the 'background_color' (0).
grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - Output grid retains all pixels from the input grid except those matching the target color.

  - example_1:
      non_background_colors: [1 (blue), 2 (red)]
      min_object_sizes: {1: 1, 2: 19}

  - example_2:
      non_background_colors: [3 (green), 8 (azure)]
      min_object_sizes: {3: 8, 8: 1}
