Connectivity is defined by sharing an edge (up, down, left, right), not just a corner. If multiple colors share the same smallest object size, choose the color with the lowest numerical value as the tie-breaker. Replace all pixels of this identified target color with the background color (white, 0). If no non-background colors exist, the grid remains unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque # Using deque for potentially faster BFS queue operations\n\nBACKGROUND_COLOR = 0\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all connected objects of a specific color in the grid using BFS.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        color (int): The color of the objects to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of sets: A list where each set contains the (row, col) tuples \n                      of pixels belonging to one connected object.
