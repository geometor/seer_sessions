```python
"""
Identify the non-background color (any color other than white, 0) that forms the smallest connected object (by pixel count) in the input grid. Connectivity is defined by sharing an edge (up, down, left, right), not just a corner. If multiple colors share the same smallest object size, choose the color with the lowest numerical value as the tie-breaker. Replace all pixels of this identified target color with the background color (white, 0). If no non-background colors exist, the grid remains unchanged.
