- task: Identify and remove a specific color based on object properties.
- objects:
    - definition: Contiguous blocks of pixels of the same non-background color (white, 0). Connectivity is 4-way (up, down, left, right).
    - properties:
        - color: The numerical value (1-9) of the pixels in the object.
        - size: The number of pixels in the object.
- analysis:
    - step: For each non-background color present in the input grid:
        - find_all_objects: Identify all distinct connected objects of that color.
        - calculate_sizes: Determine the size (pixel count) of each object.
        - find_min_size: Record the minimum object size found for that color.
    - step: Compare the minimum object sizes across all analyzed colors.
    - step: Identify the overall smallest minimum object size.
    - step: Select the target color:
        - criteria: The color(s) whose minimum object size matches the overall smallest minimum object size.
        - tie_breaker: If multiple colors meet the criteria, choose the one with the lowest numerical color value.
- action:
    - operation: Modify the input grid to produce the output grid.
    - rule: Replace every pixel matching the selected target color with the background color (white, 0).
    - unchanged_pixels: All pixels not matching the target color remain unchanged.
- edge_case: If the input grid contains no non-background colors, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
