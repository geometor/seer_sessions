One color typically forms larger, contiguous shapes or objects, while another color appears less frequently, often as individual pixels or small, scattered groups within or near the main shapes, or in the background area.\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are very similar to the input grids, with the key difference being that all pixels of the less frequent, scattered color have been changed to the background color (white, 0). The pixels of the dominant color and the background pixels (that weren't changed) remain in their original positions.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying a specific color based on its frequency and replacing all instances of that color with the background color.\n\n**Detailed Observations:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** The input has large red (2) shapes and scattered blue (1) pixels. The output removes all blue (1) pixels, replacing them with white (0). Red (2) pixels are untouched.\n*   **Example 2:** The input has large green (3) shapes and scattered azure (8) pixels. The output removes all azure (8) pixels, replacing them with white (0). Green (3) pixels are untouched.\n\n**Hypothesis:** The rule is to find the non-background color that appears least frequently in the input grid and replace all pixels of that color with the background color (white, 0).\n\n**Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
