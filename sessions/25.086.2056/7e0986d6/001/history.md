Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input Grids:** The input grids contain a background color (white, 0) and pixels of at least two other colors. One color typically forms larger, contiguous shapes or objects, while another color appears less frequently, often as individual pixels or small, scattered groups within or near the main shapes, or in the background area.
*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are very similar to the input grids, with the key difference being that all pixels of the less frequent, scattered color have been changed to the background color (white, 0). The pixels of the dominant color and the background pixels (that weren't changed) remain in their original positions.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying a specific color based on its frequency and replacing all instances of that color with the background color.

**Detailed Observations:**

*   **Example 1:** The input has large red (2) shapes and scattered blue (1) pixels. The output removes all blue (1) pixels, replacing them with white (0). Red (2) pixels are untouched.
*   **Example 2:** The input has large green (3) shapes and scattered azure (8) pixels. The output removes all azure (8) pixels, replacing them with white (0). Green (3) pixels are untouched.

**Hypothesis:** The rule is to find the non-background color that appears least frequently in the input grid and replace all pixels of that color with the background color (white, 0).

**Fact Documentation:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all unique colors present in the input grid, excluding the background color (white, 0).
3.  If there is only one non-background color, make no changes and return the copied grid.
4.  If there are multiple non-background colors:
    a.  Count the occurrences (frequency) of each non-background color within the input grid.
    b.  Determine which non-background color has the minimum count. Let this be the `target_color`.
    c.  Iterate through every pixel in the output grid.
    d.  If a pixel's color matches the `target_color`, change its color to the background color (white, 0).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
