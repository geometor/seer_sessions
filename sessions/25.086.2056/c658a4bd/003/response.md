"""
Identifies all distinct connected objects (groups of contiguous pixels of the same color, excluding background 0) in the input grid.
For each object, determines its color and calculates the area of its bounding box.
Filters the list of objects: For each color present, keeps only the single object of that color with the largest bounding box area.
From this filtered list, identifies the 'container' object as the one with the overall largest bounding box area (smallest color index tie-breaker).
Determines the square output grid size (N) as the maximum of the container object's bounding box height and width.
Initializes an N x N output grid with the background color (0).
Creates a sequence of layer colors: container color first, followed by the colors of the remaining filtered ('content') objects, sorted by descending bounding box area (ascending color index tie-breaker).
Draws concentric square frames (layers) onto the output grid using the color sequence, starting from the outermost frame (size NxN) and working inwards (N-2 x N-2, N-4 x N-4, etc.), until the center is filled or the color sequence is exhausted.
