Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

### Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct geometric shapes (objects) composed of contiguous pixels of a single color (excluding white/0, which acts as the background). These objects are scattered across the grid.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are always square. They consist of concentric, nested square frames or layers of color. The colors used in the output correspond directly to the colors of the objects present in the input grid.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve identifying all the colored objects in the input, selecting one object to define the overall size and outermost layer of the output, and then arranging the other objects' colors as concentric layers inside the first, based on some property.
4.  **Object Selection:** By comparing the two examples, the object that defines the output size and the outermost frame seems to be the one with the largest bounding box *area* in the input grid.
    *   In `train_1`, the green object (3) has the largest bounding box (7x9=63 area). The output size is 9x9 (`max(7,9)`), and the outer frame is green.
    *   In `train_2`, the red object (2) has the largest bounding box (8x8=64 area). The output size is 8x8 (`max(8,8)`), and the outer frame is red.
5.  **Layer Ordering:** The inner layers use the colors of the remaining objects. The order seems determined by the bounding box area of these objects, sorted from largest to smallest.
    *   In `train_1`, the remaining objects' BB areas are Azure (49), Yellow (25), Blue (9), Red (1). The output layers (inside green) are Azure, Yellow, Blue, Red.
    *   In `train_2`, the remaining objects' BB areas are Azure (36), Green (16), Yellow (2). The output layers (inside red) are Azure, Green, Yellow.
6.  **Layer Construction:** Each subsequent layer fills the square region inside the previous layer, reducing the dimension by 2 each time (1 pixel border on all sides). This continues until the center is filled or all object colors are used.

### Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid to find all connected components of pixels that are not the background color (white, 0). Each component is an "object". Record the color and the coordinates of all pixels for each object.
2.  **Calculate Bounding Boxes:** For each identified object, determine its bounding box by finding the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by its pixels. Calculate the height, width, and area (height * width) of this bounding box.
3.  **Identify Container Object:** Find the object that has the largest bounding box area. This is the "container" object. Note its color (C_container) and its bounding box height (H_container) and width (W_container). If there's a tie in bounding box area, the task examples don't show this, but a consistent tie-breaking rule (e.g., lowest color index) might be needed.
4.  **Determine Output Size:** Calculate the size (S) for the square output grid as the maximum of the container object's bounding box height and width: `S = max(H_container, W_container)`.
5.  **Identify and Sort Content Objects:** Create a list of all objects *except* the container object. These are the "content" objects. Sort this list in descending order based on their bounding box area. If there's a tie, use a consistent secondary sort key (e.g., lowest color index). Let the sorted colors be C_1, C_2, ..., C_n.
6.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new square grid of size `S x S`.
7.  **Draw Layers:** Fill the output grid with concentric square layers, starting from the outside and working inwards:
    a.  Initialize layer parameters: current dimension `s = S`, current top-left corner `(r, c) = (0, 0)`.
    b.  **Draw Container Layer:** Fill the outermost frame of the `s x s` area starting at `(r, c)` with the container color `C_container`. This involves coloring row `r`, row `r+s-1`, column `c`, and column `c+s-1` within the bounds `[c, c+s-1]` and `[r, r+s-1]`, respectively.
    c.  Update layer parameters for the next inner layer: `s = s - 2`, `r = r + 1`, `c = c + 1`.
    d.  **Draw Content Layers:** Iterate through the sorted content object colors (C_1, C_2, ..., C_n):
        i.   If `s <= 0`, stop (the grid center is filled).
        ii.  Fill the outermost frame of the current `s x s` area starting at `(r, c)` with the current content color `C_i`.
        iii. Update layer parameters for the next inner layer: `s = s - 2`, `r = r + 1`, `c = c + 1`.
8.  **Return Output:** The fully drawn `S x S` grid is the final output.
