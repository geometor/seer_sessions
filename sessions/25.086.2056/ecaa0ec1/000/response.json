This pattern appears once in each input grid.\n    *   Several scattered yellow (4) pixels. The number of yellow pixels is consistently 4 in the training examples.\n    *   The background is primarily white (0).\n3.  **Observed Transformation:**\n    *   The 3x3 blue/azure pattern undergoes a rotation. Comparing input and output patterns across examples suggests a consistent 90-degree clockwise rotation. The position (top-left corner) of the pattern remains unchanged.\n    *   The scattered yellow pixels in the input are replaced by a *single* yellow pixel in the output.\n    *   The location of the single output yellow pixel appears related to the locations of all the input yellow pixels. Calculating the median coordinates (row and column) of the input yellow pixels seems promising. A specific rounding rule is needed when the median falls exactly between two integers (i.e., ends in .5). This rounding seems dependent on the location of the center of the 3x3 blue/azure pattern: round towards the pattern's center coordinate.\n    *   All other pixels (the white background and the pixels within the rotated 3x3 pattern) remain unchanged relative to the pattern's transformation.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Record its top-left row and column index (`pattern_r`, `pattern_c`).\n3.  **Rotate Pattern:** Extract the 3x3 pattern from the input grid. Rotate this extracted pattern 90 degrees clockwise. Place the rotated pattern back into the output grid at the original top-left position (`pattern_r`, `pattern_c`), overwriting the original pattern.\n4.  **Identify Yellow Pixels:** Find the coordinates (row, column) of all pixels with the color yellow (4) in the original input grid. Store these coordinates in a list.\n5.  **Handle Yellow Pixel Consolidation:**\n    *   If the list of yellow pixel coordinates is not empty:\n        *   **Calculate Median Coordinates:** Compute the median row index and median column index from the list of coordinates.\n        *   **Determine Pattern Center:** Calculate the coordinates of the center pixel of the 3x3 pattern: `center_r = pattern_r + 1`, `center_c = pattern_c + 1`.\n        *   **Apply Rounding (if necessary):**\n            *   If the calculated median row ends in .5: If `center_r` is greater than the floor of the median row, round the median row up; otherwise, round it down.\n            *   If the calculated median column ends in .5: If `center_c` is greater than the floor of the median column, round the median column up; otherwise, round it down.\n        *   Let the final, possibly rounded, coordinates be `target_r` and `target_c`.\n        *   **Update Output Grid:** Iterate through the original yellow pixel coordinates found in step 4. For each coordinate, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0). Finally, set the pixel at (`target_r`, `target_c`) in the output grid to yellow (4).\n    *   If the list of yellow pixel coordinates is empty, make no changes related to yellow pixels.\n6.  **Final Output:** The modified grid is the final output."
