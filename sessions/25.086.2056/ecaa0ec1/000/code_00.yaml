    value:
      - type: Pattern
        identifier: 3x3 block containing blue (1) and azure (8) pixels
        properties:
          - color_composition: blue (1), azure (8)
          - size: 3x3
          - count: 1 per grid
      - type: Point
        identifier: Isolated yellow (4) pixels
        properties:
          - color: yellow (4)
          - count: Variable (4 in training examples)
          - distribution: Scattered

transformations:
  - object_type: Pattern (blue/azure 3x3 block)
    action: Rotation
    details: Rotate 90 degrees clockwise, in place (top-left corner remains fixed).
  - object_type: Point (yellow pixels)
    action: Consolidation and Relocation
    details:
      - Find all yellow (4) pixels in the input.
      - Calculate the median row and median column index based on the coordinates of all input yellow pixels.
      - Determine the coordinate of the center pixel of the 3x3 blue/azure pattern.
      - Rounding rule for median coordinates ending in .5:
          - If the median row ends in .5, round it towards the row coordinate of the pattern's center pixel.
          - If the median column ends in .5, round it towards the column coordinate of the pattern's center pixel.
      - Remove all original yellow pixels from the grid (change them to white).
      - Place a single new yellow pixel at the final calculated (rounded) median coordinate.

grid_properties:
  - size: Variable height and width.
  - background: Primarily white (0).
