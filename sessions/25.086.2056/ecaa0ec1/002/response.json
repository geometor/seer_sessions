            "text": "The calculation for the yellow pixel's target location using the median and the custom rounding rule appears to be correct for all examples. The `target_loc_calculated` matches the `expected_yellow_loc` in every case.\n\nThis confirms the issue lies *only* with the rotation of the 3x3 pattern.\n\nRevisiting the rotation discrepancy:\n*   Examples 1, 2, 3 seem to require a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation (`k=1`).\n*   Example 4 seems to require a 180-degree rotation (`k=2`).\n\nWhat distinguishes Example 4's pattern `[[8, 1, 8], [8, 1, 8], [1, 1, 8]]` from the others?\n*   It has two identical rows: `[8, 1, 8]`.\n*   Let's count colors: 5 azure (8), 4 blue (1).\n*   Example 1: `[[8, 1, 8], [1, 8, 8], [1, 1, 1]]` - 4 azure, 5 blue\n*   Example 2: `[[1, 1, 1], [8, 1, 8], [8, 1, 1]]` - 3 azure, 6 blue\n*   Example 3: `[[1, 1, 1], [8, 8, 8], [1, 8, 1]]` - 4 azure, 5 blue\n\nCould the rotation depend on the count of blue vs. azure pixels?\n*   Ex 1: Blue > Azure (5 > 4) -> Rotate CCW 90 deg\n*   Ex 2: Blue > Azure (6 > 3) -> Rotate CCW 90 deg\n*   Ex 3: Blue > Azure (5 > 4) -> Rotate CCW 90 deg\n*   Ex 4: Azure >= Blue (5 >= 4) -> Rotate 180 deg\n\nThis seems like a plausible rule. Let's formalize it.\n\n**Updated Transformation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify Pattern:** Find the 3x3 subgrid composed of only blue (1) and azure (8) pixels. Let its top-left corner be `(pattern_r, pattern_c)`.\n2.  **Analyze Pattern Content:** Count the number of blue pixels (`count_blue`) and azure pixels (`count_azure`) within the 3x3 pattern.\n3.  **Determine Rotation:**\n    *   If `count_blue > count_azure`, rotate the pattern 90 degrees counter-clockwise (`np.rot90(pattern, k=1)`).\n    *   If `count_azure >= count_blue`, rotate the pattern 180 degrees (`np.rot90(pattern, k=2)`).\n4.  **Apply Rotation:** Replace the original pattern in the output grid with the rotated pattern.\n5.  **Consolidate Yellow Pixels (if any):**\n    a. Find coordinates of all yellow (4) pixels.\n    b. Calculate the median row (`median_row`) and median column (`median_col`) of the yellow pixels.\n    c. Determine the pattern center coordinates: `center_r = pattern_r + 1`, `center_c = pattern_c + 1`.\n    d. Calculate the target row (`target_r`) and column (`target_c`):\n        *   Apply standard rounding (round half to even, or just `floor(x + 0.5)`) to `median_row` and `median_col`.\n        *   *Correction*: Use the custom rounding rule from the original code/analysis. If `median_row` ends in .5, round towards `center_r`. If `median_col` ends in .5, round towards `center_c`. Otherwise, use standard rounding (e.g., `floor(x + 0.5)` or `int(round(x))`).\n    e. Remove all original yellow pixels from the output grid (set to white (0)).\n    f. Place a single yellow pixel at `(target_r, target_c)` in the output grid.\n6.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.\n\nThis revised logic seems to cover all observed cases. The anomaly in the results log for Example 3 (showing a match despite the code seemingly implementing the wrong rotation) is noted but overridden by the analysis suggesting a consistent counter-clockwise rotation for cases where blue pixels outnumber azure pixels. The core logic update is the conditional rotation based on the blue/azure count.**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code implements two main transformations: rotation of a 3x3 blue/azure pattern and consolidation of scattered yellow pixels to a single location based on their median position.\n\nThe initial analysis, based on Example 1, hypothesized a 90-degree clockwise rotation. However, testing against other examples revealed inconsistencies:\n- Examples 1, 2, and 4 failed.\n- Example 3 passed, but further analysis suggests this might be erroneous in the test report, or the specific pattern in Example 3 coincidentally produces the same result for both clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation (which was disproven by manual check).\n\nThe yellow pixel consolidation logic, including the median calculation and the custom rounding rule (rounding .5 values towards the pattern center), appears correct based on the metric gathering performed.\n\nThe primary cause of failure is the pattern rotation rule. The rotation is not a fixed 90-degree clockwise turn. By comparing the input patterns and expected output patterns across all examples, a new hypothesis emerged: the type of rotation depends on the relative counts of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels within the 3x3 pattern.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution**\n\n1.  **Verify Yellow Pixel Logic:** Confirm the median calculation and custom rounding implementation matches the expected output locations across all examples (verified using code execution - appears correct).\n2.  **Analyze Pattern Rotation Rule:** Determine the correct rotation rule by comparing input/output patterns for all examples.\n3.  **Identify Rotation Condition:** Find the condition that determines which rotation to apply (e.g., based on pixel counts within the pattern).\n4.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Refine the program to incorporate the conditional rotation logic.\n5.  **Update Code:** Modify the Python function to implement the revised rotation rule.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nMetrics for yellow pixel consolidation were gathered using `tool_code` and confirmed the correctness of the median calculation and custom rounding logic implemented in the original `transform` function.\n\nPattern analysis:\n- **Example 1:** Input `[[8, 1, 8], [1, 8, 8], [1, 1, 1]]` (4 azure, 5 blue) -> Expected `[[8, 8, 1], [1, 8, 1], [8, 1, 1]]` (90 deg CCW)\n- **Example 2:** Input `[[1, 1, 1], [8, 1, 8], [8, 1, 1]]` (3 azure, 6 blue) -> Expected `[[1, 8, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 8, 8]]` (90 deg CCW)\n- **Example 3:** Input `[[1, 1, 1], [8, 8, 8], [1, 8, 1]]` (4 azure, 5 blue) -> Expected `[[1, 8, 1], [1, 8, 8], [1, 8, 1]]` (90 deg CCW)\n- **Example 4:** Input `[[8, 1, 8], [8, 1, 8], [1, 1, 8]]` (5 azure, 4 blue) -> Expected `[[8, 1, 1], [8, 1, 8], [8, 1, 8]]` (180 deg)\n\n**Conditional Rule:**\n- If `count_blue > count_azure`: Rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise (`k=1`).\n- If `count_azure >= count_blue`: Rotate 180 degrees (`k=2`).\n\nThis rule holds for all examples.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet**\n\n"
