The code applied a 180-degree rotation, but the expected output requires a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Verify the pattern analysis (counts) for Example 1.\n2.  Confirm the required rotation for Example 1 by comparing the input pattern to the expected output pattern.\n3.  Update the specific rotation rule that failed.\n4.  Ensure the updated rule does not conflict with the conditions for the successful examples.\n5.  Refine the natural language program and YAML facts based on the corrected logic.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's gather detailed metrics for each example's pattern to verify the conditions leading to rotation.\n\n"

Record its top-left coordinates. If no such pattern is found, skip steps 3-4 and proceed to step 5.\n3.  **Analyze Pattern:**\n    a.  Extract the 3x3 pattern.\n    b.  Count the total number of blue pixels (`count_blue`) and azure pixels (`count_azure`) within the pattern.\n    c.  Identify the four corner pixels (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) relative to the pattern's start.\n    d.  Count how many of these corner pixels are blue (`count_corner_blue`).\n    e.  Determine the coordinates of the pattern's central pixel (`center_r`, `center_c`).\n4.  **Rotate Pattern:**\n    a.  Determine the rotation needed based on the counts:\n        *   If `count_azure > count_blue`, rotate the pattern 180 degrees.\n        *   If `count_blue > count_azure`:\n            *   If `count_corner_blue` is 4, rotate 90 degrees clockwise.\n            *   If `count_corner_blue` is 3, rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n            *   If `count_corner_blue` is 2, rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n            *   *(No rotation specified for other `count_corner_blue` values when `count_blue > count_azure` based on examples).*\n        *   Otherwise (e.g., counts are equal), do not rotate the pattern.\n    b.

Calculate the median of the row coordinates (`median_row`) and the median of the column coordinates (`median_col`).\n        ii.

Otherwise, round `median_row` using standard rounding (half up).\n            *   For the column: If `median_col` ends in .5 *and* a pattern was found (providing `center_c`), round `median_col` towards `center_c`.
