            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully implemented the yellow pixel consolidation logic, including the custom rounding rule based on the pattern's center. However, it failed on Example 3 due to an incorrect rotation rule for the central 3x3 blue/azure pattern. The original rule differentiated rotation based only on whether blue or azure pixels were more numerous. Analysis of all four examples reveals a more nuanced rule is needed when blue pixels outnumber azure pixels: the direction of the 90-degree rotation (clockwise or counter-clockwise) depends on the color of the pattern's central pixel. The logic for 180-degree rotation when azure pixels are greater than or equal to blue pixels remains correct. The yellow pixel consolidation logic appears correct and does not need modification.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's verify the properties of the 3x3 pattern in each example.\n"

            "text": "**Correction:** My manual count for Example 1 was wrong. The code execution shows:\n*   Example 1: Blue=5, Azure=4, Center=8.\n*   Example 4: Blue=4, Azure=5, Center=1.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the rotation hypothesis with the correct counts:\n\n**New Rotation Hypothesis (Revised):**\n1.  Identify the 3x3 pattern of blue (1) and azure (8).\n2.  Count blue (`count_blue`) and azure (`count_azure`).\n3.  Get the color of the center pixel (`center_color`).\n4.  Determine rotation:\n    *   If `count_blue > count_azure`:\n        *   If `center_color` is blue (1): Rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise. (Example 2: B=6, A=3, C=1 -> 90 CCW. Correct.)\n        *   If `center_color` is azure (8): Rotate 90 degrees clockwise. (Example 1: B=5, A=4, C=8 -> 90 CW? Expected output is 180 rotation. **Fails**) (Example 3: B=5, A=4, C=8 -> 90 CW. Correct.)\n    *   If `count_azure >= count_blue`: Rotate 180 degrees. (Example 4: B=4, A=5, C=1 -> 180. Correct.)\n\nThis hypothesis fails for Example 1. The expected output for Example 1 is a 180-degree rotation, but the counts are B=5, A=4, and the center is 8. The hypothesis suggests a 90 CW rotation for this case.\n\nLet's reconsider the failed Example 1:\n*   Input Pattern: `[[8,1,8],[1,8,8],[1,1,1]]` (B=5, A=4, C=8)\n*   Expected Output Pattern: `[[1,1,1],[8,8,1],[8,1,8]]` (This is 180 rotation of input)\n\nMaybe the primary condition isn't `count_blue > count_azure`. What if the rotation depends *only* on the center pixel?\n\n**Hypothesis based on Center Pixel:**\n*   If `center_color` is blue (1): Rotate ??? (Ex 2: 90 CCW, Ex 4: 180)\n*   If `center_color` is azure (8): Rotate ??? (Ex 1: 180, Ex 3: 90 CW)\n\nThis doesn't seem consistent either.\n\nLet's look at the *type* of rotation that *occurred* in the expected output vs the counts and center.\n\n| Example | Count Blue | Count Azure | Center | Rotation Type      | Condition Met (Original Rule) | Condition Met (Center-Based Rule) |\n| :------ | :--------- | :---------- | :----- | :----------------- | :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |\n| 1       | 5          | 4           | 8      | 180                | `B > A` (Predicted 90 CCW)    | `B > A`, `C=8` (Predicted 90 CW)  |\n| 2       | 6          | 3           | 1      | 90 CCW             | `B > A` (Predicted 90 CCW)    | `B > A`, `C=1` (Predicted 90 CCW) |\n| 3       | 5          | 4           | 8      | 90 CW              | `B > A` (Predicted 90 CCW)    | `B > A`, `C=8` (Predicted 90 CW)  |\n| 4       | 4          | 5           | 1      | 180                | `A >= B` (Predicted 180)      | `A >= B` (Predicted 180)          |\n\nThe only consistent rule that fits all examples seems elusive based purely on counts and the center pixel.\n\nRevisiting Example 1:\nInput: `[[8,1,8],[1,8,8],[1,1,1]]` (B=5, A=4, C=8)\nOutput: `[[1,1,1],[8,8,1],[8,1,8]]` (180 rotation)\n\nRevisiting Example 3:\nInput: `[[1,1,1],[8,8,8],[1,8,1]]` (B=5, A=4, C=8)\nOutput: `[[1,8,1],[8,8,1],[1,8,1]]` (90 CW rotation)\n\nBoth Example 1 and Example 3 have B=5, A=4, C=8. Why does one rotate 180 and the other 90 CW? There must be another distinguishing feature.\n\nLet's look at the specific *arrangements*:\n\n*   Ex 1 Pattern: `[[8,1,8],[1,8,8],[1,1,1]]`\n*   Ex 3 Pattern: `[[1,1,1],[8,8,8],[1,8,1]]`\n\nMaybe symmetry plays a role?\n*   Ex 1: No clear rotational or reflectional symmetry.\n*   Ex 3: Reflectional symmetry across the vertical axis.\n\nLet's check other examples for symmetry:\n*   Ex 2 Pattern: `[[1,1,1],[8,1,8],[8,1,1]]`. No symmetry. Rotated 90 CCW.\n*   Ex 4 Pattern: `[[8,1,8],[8,1,8],[1,1,8]]`. No symmetry. Rotated 180.\n\n**Symmetry Hypothesis:**\n1.  Identify the 3x3 pattern.\n2.  Check for vertical reflectional symmetry (pattern == pattern[:, ::-1]).\n3.  Count blue (`count_blue`) and azure (`count_azure`).\n4.  Determine rotation:\n    *   If `count_azure > count_blue`: Rotate 180 degrees. (Ex 4: B=4, A=5. Correct).\n    *   If `count_blue > count_azure`:\n        *   If the pattern has vertical symmetry: Rotate 90 degrees clockwise. (Ex 3: B=5, A=4, Symmetric. Correct).\n        *   If the pattern does *not* have vertical symmetry: Rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise. (Ex 2: B=6, A=3, Not Symmetric. Correct).\n    *   What about `count_blue == count_azure`? Doesn't occur in examples.\n    *   What about Example 1? B=5, A=4, Not symmetric. Hypothesis says 90 CCW. Actual is 180. **Fails**.\n\nThis is proving trickier than expected. Let's assume the yellow pixel logic is stable and focus only on the rotation. The core issue is distinguishing Example 1 (B=5, A=4, C=8 -> 180 rot) from Example 3 (B=5, A=4, C=8 -> 90 CW rot).\n\nCould the position of the yellow pixels influence the rotation? Unlikely given the ARC priors (focus on geometry/topology of the main object).\n\nLet's try comparing the number of blue/azure pixels on the border vs the center?\n*   Ex 1: Center=8. Border B=5, A=3. Overall B=5, A=4.\n*   Ex 3: Center=8. Border B=5, A=3. Overall B=5, A=4.\nIdentical counts here too.\n\nIs it about connectivity? Number of contiguous groups?\n*   Ex 1: `[[8,1,8],[1,8,8],[1,1,1]]`. 1 group of 8s (size 4), 1 group of 1s (size 5).\n*   Ex 3: `[[1,1,1],[8,8,8],[1,8,1]]`. 1 group of 1s (size 5), 1 group of 8s (size 4).\nIdentical group counts.\n\nLet's re-run the code analysis just to be absolutely sure about the counts. (The previous run was correct).\n\nCould the initial code be correct for the rotation rule, but the *expected output* for Example 1 or Example 3 is wrong in the prompt data?\n*   If Rule is `B>A` -> 90 CCW, else 180:\n    *   Ex 1: B=5, A=4. Predicts 90 CCW. Expected is 180.\n    *   Ex 2: B=6, A=3. Predicts 90 CCW. Expected is 90 CCW.\n    *   Ex 3: B=5, A=4. Predicts 90 CCW. Expected is 90 CW.\n    *   Ex 4: B=4, A=5. Predicts 180. Expected is 180.\nThis original rule fails Ex 1 and Ex 3.\n\n*   If Rule is `B>A & C=1` -> 90 CCW, `B>A & C=8` -> 90 CW, else 180:\n    *   Ex 1: B=5, A=4, C=8. Predicts 90 CW. Expected is 180.\n    *   Ex 2: B=6, A=3, C=1. Predicts 90 CCW. Expected is 90 CCW.\n    *   Ex 3: B=5, A=4, C=8. Predicts 90 CW. Expected is 90 CW.\n    *   Ex 4: B=4, A=5, C=1. Predicts 180. Expected is 180.\nThis rule fails Ex 1.\n\nThere might be a simpler condition missed. Look at the pattern counts again.\n\n| Example | B | A | C | Rotation |\n| :------ |:-:|:-:|:-:| :------- |\n| 1       | 5 | 4 | 8 | 180      |\n| 2       | 6 | 3 | 1 | 90 CCW   |\n| 3       | 5 | 4 | 8 | 90 CW    |\n| 4       | 4 | 5 | 1 | 180      |\n\nIf A > B, rotate 180 (Ex 4).\nIf B > A:\n  If B=6, A=3, rotate 90 CCW (Ex 2).\n  If B=5, A=4:\n    Rotate 180 (Ex 1) ???\n    Rotate 90 CW (Ex 3) ???\n\nMaybe it depends on the number of **azure** pixels when B > A?\n*   B > A:\n    *   If A = 3: Rotate 90 CCW (Ex 2)\n    *   If A = 4: Rotate 180 (Ex 1) OR 90 CW (Ex 3) - Still ambiguous.\n\nMaybe it depends on the number of **blue** pixels when B > A?\n*   B > A:\n    *   If B = 6: Rotate 90 CCW (Ex 2)\n    *   If B = 5: Rotate 180 (Ex 1) OR 90 CW (Ex 3) - Still ambiguous.\n\nIs it possible the rule involves the yellow pixels? The prompt suggests yellow pixels are just markers to be consolidated.\n\nLet's assume the yellow consolidation is separate. The rotation rule needs to differentiate Ex 1 and Ex 3. They have identical B, A counts and center pixel C.\n\nWhat *is* different between pattern 1 and pattern 3?\nP1: `[[8,1,8],[1,8,8],[1,1,1]]`\nP3: `[[1,1,1],[8,8,8],[1,8,1]]`\n\nCompare corners?\nP1 Corners: 8, 8, 1, 1 (2 blue, 2 azure)\nP3 Corners: 1, 1, 1, 1 (4 blue, 0 azure)\n\nCompare edges (excluding corners)?\nP1 Edges: 1, 1, 8, 1 (3 blue, 1 azure)\nP3 Edges: 1, 8, 8, 8 (1 blue, 3 azure)\n\n**Corner/Edge Hypothesis:**\n1. Find pattern. Count B, A.\n2. If A > B: Rotate 180. (Ex 4: B=4, A=5. Correct)\n3. If B > A:\n    a. Count blue pixels in the 4 corners (`corner_blue`).\n    b. If `corner_blue` == 4: Rotate 90 CW. (Ex 3: B=5, A=4, Corners=4B. Correct)\n    c. If `corner_blue` == 2: Rotate 180. (Ex 1: B=5, A=4, Corners=2B. Correct)\n    d. If `corner_blue` != 4 and != 2 (what about Ex 2?):\n        * Ex 2: B=6, A=3. Corners: 1, 1, 8, 1 (3 blue). Needs 90 CCW. Let's refine (d).\n    d. If `corner_blue` == 3: Rotate 90 CCW. (Ex 2: B=6, A=3, Corners=3B. Correct)\n\n**Refined Corner Hypothesis:**\n1. Identify the 3x3 pattern.\n2. Count blue (`count_blue`) and azure (`count_azure`).\n3. If `count_azure > count_blue`: Rotate 180 degrees.\n4. If `count_blue > count_azure`:\n    a. Count blue pixels in the 4 corners (`corner_blue`).\n    b. If `corner_blue` == 4: Rotate 90 degrees clockwise.\n    c. If `corner_blue` == 3: Rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n    d. If `corner_blue` == 2: Rotate 180 degrees.\n    e. (Handle other `corner_blue` counts if they arise, e.g., 0 or 1, though unlikely with B>A).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n*   Ex 1: B=5, A=4. `B > A`. Corner Blue = 2. Rule says 180. Correct.\n*   Ex 2: B=6, A=3. `B > A`. Corner Blue = 3. Rule says 90 CCW. Correct.\n*   Ex 3: B=5, A=4. `B > A`. Corner Blue = 4. Rule says 90 CW. Correct.\n*   Ex 4: B=4, A=5. `A > B`. Rule says 180. Correct.\n\nThis hypothesis fits all four examples.\n\n## YAML Fact Sheet\n\n"
