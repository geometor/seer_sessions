            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Analysis:** Both input examples consist primarily of a background color (white, 0). Within each input grid, there is a distinct, horizontally oriented pattern made of a single non-background color (red (2) in the first example, azure (8) in the second). This pattern spans the full width of a sub-region of the grid and has a height of 3 rows. The pattern itself is composed of three unique rows:\n    *   Example 1 (Red): Alternating red/white, Solid red, Alternating red/white.\n    *   Example 2 (Azure): Sparse azure, Solid azure, Different sparse azure.\n    The rest of the input grid is filled with the background color (white).\n\n2.  **Output Grid Analysis:** The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. The entire output grid is filled by vertically repeating the 3-row pattern identified in the input. The repetition starts from the top row (row 0) and continues downwards, wrapping around if the grid height is not a multiple of the pattern height (3). The background color from the input grid is effectively ignored or overwritten in the output.\n\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the non-background colored pattern within the input, extracting this pattern (specifically, the rows containing any non-background color), and then using this extracted pattern as a repeating vertical tile to construct the output grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
