Task: Vertical Tiling

Input:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      - contains a background color (white, 0)
      - contains a single foreground color (e.g., red, azure)
      - foreground pixels form a contiguous block when considering only rows containing them
      - this block represents a repeating "motif" or pattern
  - motif_properties:
      - spans a subset of rows
      - spans the full width of the grid within those rows (or a sub-width in other cases, here it's full width)
      - extracted by finding the bounding box of all non-background pixels

Output:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      - same dimensions as the input grid
      - filled entirely by vertically tiling the extracted motif
  - relationships:
      - output_row[r] = motif_row[r % motif_height] for all rows r
      - output grid color palette is determined solely by the motif colors

Derived_elements:
  - motif:
      - description: The smallest subgrid containing all non-background pixels from the input.
      - identified_by: Bounding box of non-background pixels.
      - role: Acts as the tile for the output grid.
  - background_color:
      - description: The most frequent color in the input grid, typically white (0).
      - role: Used to identify the foreground pattern/motif. Ignored in the output construction.
  - foreground_color:
      - description: The color(s) making up the motif.
      - role: Defines the content of the motif and thus the output.

Transformation:
  - name: Extract and Tile Vertically
  - steps:
      1. Identify non-background pixels in the input grid.
      2. Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices containing these pixels (bounding box).
      3. Extract the subgrid defined by these row and column indices (the motif).
      4. Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
      5. For each row `r` from 0 to output_height - 1:
         - Determine the corresponding source row index in the motif: `motif_r = r % motif_height`.
         - Copy the `motif_r`-th row of the motif to the `r`-th row of the output grid.
