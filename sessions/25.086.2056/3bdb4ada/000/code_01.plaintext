1.  Identify all distinct, contiguous, solid rectangular blocks of non-white color in the input grid.
2.  For each identified block, check if its height is exactly 3 rows.
3.  If a block's height is 3 rows:
    a.  Locate the middle row of this block.
    b.  Keep track of the block's original color.
    c.  Iterate through the columns occupied by the block in this middle row.
    d.  Starting with the first column of the block in this row, set the pixel color to the block's original color.
    e.  For the next column, set the pixel color to white (0).
    f.  Continue alternating between the original color and white for all columns within the block's width in that middle row.
4.  If a block's height is not 3 rows, leave it unchanged.
5.  Leave all background (white) pixels unchanged.
6.  The resulting grid is the output.
