In the provided examples, there are always two such blocks. The key transformation observed is that for certain blocks, their middle horizontal row is modified into an alternating pattern.\n*   **Analysis:** By comparing the input and output grids, I notice that only blocks that are exactly 3 rows high are affected. The top and bottom rows of these 3-row-high blocks remain unchanged. The middle row of these blocks is altered: starting from the leftmost pixel of the block in that row, the pixels alternate between the original block color and white (color 0). Pixels outside these specific blocks (the background and any blocks not 3 rows high) are unchanged.\n\n"
