Specifically, vertical lines of azure extend downwards from the columns that contained azure pixels in the upper part of the input grid.\n    *   These downward extensions fill only the white pixels.\n    *   The extension of an azure line in a column stops when it encounters a non-white pixel in that column or reaches the bottom edge of the grid.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
