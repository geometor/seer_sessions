The output grids exhibit a distinct pattern of concentric square frames of solid colors, surrounding a central pixel. The specific colors used in the output frames correspond to colors found adjacent to each other in a nested or layered manner within the input grid. The size of the output grid appears directly related to the number of distinct colors forming these nested layers.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
