**Perception**

The input grids contain a single object composed of azure (8) pixels set against a white (0) background. The shape and position of the azure object vary between examples.
The output grids are the same size as the corresponding input grids. They also contain patterns of azure (8) and white (0) pixels.
The transformation appears to involve identifying regions in the input grid based on their relationship to the azure object and the grid boundaries. Specifically, it seems to distinguish between white pixels that are 'outside' (reachable from the border without crossing the azure object) and those that are 'inside' (enclosed by the azure object).
The output grid seems to be generated by:
1.  Changing the original azure pixels in the input to white in the output.
2.  Keeping the 'outside' white pixels as white in the output.
3.  Changing the 'inside' white pixels to azure in the output.
This suggests a flood-fill or region-labeling algorithm starting from the borders.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Identify enclosed white regions within an azure boundary and fill them with azure, while turning the boundary white.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Variable (e.g., 22x22, 12x12, 16x16)
  - colors: [white (0), azure (8)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_shape
    color: azure (8)
    location: variable within the grid
    role: acts as a boundary or barrier
  - type: region
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - location: surrounding the azure shape
      - classification:
          - exterior: reachable from grid border without crossing azure pixels
          - interior: not reachable from grid border without crossing azure pixels
relationships:
  - white pixels are classified based on their connectivity (8-directional adjacency, including diagonals) to the grid border, constrained by the azure pixels acting as barriers.
actions:
  - identify_boundary_pixels: Find all white pixels adjacent (including diagonals) to any edge of the grid.
  - flood_fill: Starting from the boundary white pixels, mark all reachable white pixels (traveling only through white pixels, using 8-directional adjacency). These are the 'exterior' white pixels.
  - transform_pixels:
    - Input azure (8) pixels become white (0) in the output.
    - Input white (0) pixels marked as 'exterior' remain white (0) in the output.
    - Input white (0) pixels *not* marked as 'exterior' (i.e., 'interior') become azure (8) in the output.
output_description: The output grid represents the 'interior' regions of the input grid filled with azure, while the original azure boundary and the 'exterior' regions are white.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty 'visited' grid/set of the same dimensions as the input grid to keep track of reachable white pixels.
2.  Create a queue and add the coordinates of all white (0) pixels that are located on the border (row 0, last row, column 0, last column) of the input grid. Mark these coordinates as 'visited'.
3.  While the queue is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue a coordinate (r, c).
    b.  Examine its 8 neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
    c.  For each neighbor (nr, nc) that is within the grid bounds:
        i.   If the neighbor cell in the input grid is white (0) and has not been 'visited':
            1.  Mark the neighbor (nr, nc) as 'visited'.
            2.  Enqueue the neighbor's coordinate (nr, nc).
4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized with a default color (e.g., white).
5.  Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid:
    a.  If the input cell (r, c) is azure (8), set the output cell (r, c) to white (0).
    b.  If the input cell (r, c) is white (0):
        i.   If the coordinate (r, c) is marked as 'visited', set the output cell (r, c) to white (0).
        ii.  If the coordinate (r, c) is *not* marked as 'visited', set the output cell (r, c) to azure (8).
6.  Return the generated output grid.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core task: finding white regions enclosed by azure pixels and filling them (while making the boundary white). The chosen method, a flood fill (BFS) from the border to identify 'exterior' white pixels, is a standard approach for this type of region-finding task.

However, the provided code failed on all training examples, producing an all-white output grid instead of filling the interior regions with azure. The failure report indicates that the transformed output matches the expected output in size but has zero azure pixels, whereas the expected outputs clearly contain azure pixels. This points to a fundamental issue where the flood fill algorithm incorrectly identifies *all* white pixels as being connected to the border ('exterior'), leaving no 'interior' pixels to color azure.

The most likely cause, identified through manual tracing, is the use of 8-directional connectivity (including diagonals) for the flood fill. This allows the fill to "leak" through single-pixel diagonal gaps in the azure boundary, incorrectly marking enclosed regions as reachable from the outside.

**Strategy:** Modify the flood fill algorithm to use 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right) instead of 8-directional connectivity. This will prevent the fill from passing through diagonal gaps in the azure boundary, correctly separating interior and exterior white regions.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Identify enclosed white regions within an azure boundary and fill them with azure, while turning the boundary white. Requires strict separation based on the boundary.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Variable (e.g., 22x22, 12x12, 16x16)
  - colors: [white (0), azure (8)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_shape
    color: azure (8)
    location: variable within the grid
    role: acts as a boundary or barrier separating interior from exterior regions.
  - type: region
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - location: surrounding the azure shape or enclosed by it.
      - classification:
          - exterior: reachable from grid border using 4-directional adjacency without crossing azure pixels.
          - interior: not reachable from grid border using 4-directional adjacency without crossing azure pixels.
relationships:
  - white pixels are classified based on their connectivity (4-directional adjacency: up, down, left, right) to the grid border, constrained by the azure pixels acting as strict barriers. Diagonal adjacency is NOT sufficient to cross the barrier for the purpose of region classification.
actions:
  - identify_boundary_pixels: Find all white pixels adjacent (4-directionally) to any edge of the grid.
  - flood_fill: Starting from the border white pixels, mark all reachable white pixels (traveling only through white pixels, using 4-directional adjacency: up, down, left, right). These are the 'exterior' white pixels.
  - transform_pixels:
    - Input azure (8) pixels become white (0) in the output.
    - Input white (0) pixels marked as 'exterior' remain white (0) in the output.
    - Input white (0) pixels *not* marked as 'exterior' (i.e., 'interior') become azure (8) in the output.
output_description: The output grid represents the 'interior' regions of the input grid filled with azure, while the original azure boundary and the 'exterior' regions are white.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty 'visited' grid/set of the same dimensions as the input grid to keep track of reachable white pixels (exterior region).
2.  Create a queue for Breadth-First Search (BFS).
3.  Add the coordinates of all white (0) pixels located on the border (row 0, last row, column 0, last column) of the input grid to the queue. Mark these coordinates as 'visited'.
4.  While the queue is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue a coordinate (r, c).
    b.  Examine its 4 neighbors (up, down, left, right). Define neighbors as (r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1).
    c.  For each neighbor (nr, nc):
        i.   Check if the neighbor's coordinates (nr, nc) are within the grid bounds.
        ii.  If the neighbor cell (nr, nc) in the input grid is white (0) AND it has not been 'visited':
            1.  Mark the neighbor (nr, nc) as 'visited'.
            2.  Enqueue the neighbor's coordinate (nr, nc).
5.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
6.  Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid:
    a.  If the input cell (r, c) is azure (8), set the corresponding output cell (r, c) to white (0).
    b.  If the input cell (r, c) is white (0):
        i.   If the coordinate (r, c) is marked as 'visited' (meaning it's part of the exterior region), set the output cell (r, c) to white (0).
        ii.  If the coordinate (r, c) is *not* marked as 'visited' (meaning it's part of an interior region), set the output cell (r, c) to azure (8).
7.  Return the generated output grid.
