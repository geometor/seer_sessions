task_context:
  description: Transform the main grid based on color keys defined in a separate top panel.
  input_structure:
    - type: separator
      color: gray (5)
      orientation: horizontal
      location: divides grid into top and bottom sections
    - type: key_panel
      location: top section (above separator)
      content: multiple gray-bordered 1x4 or 4x1 patterns containing one non-white color and three white pixels.
      purpose: defines a set of 'protected' colors.
    - type: main_grid
      location: bottom section (below separator)
      content: background color, various colored shapes, includes a 2x2 azure (8) square.
      purpose: the area to be transformed.
  output_structure:
    - type: grid
      size: matches the input's main_grid size.
      content: modified version of the input's main_grid.

objects:
  - id: key_colors
    source: non-white pixels adjacent to white pixels in the key_panel.
    property: 'protected' - these colors resist overwriting.
  - id: main_grid_pixels
    source: all pixels in the main_grid section of the input.
  - id: stamp_color
    value: azure (8)
  - id: stamp_unit
    shape: 2x2 square

actions:
  - action: extract_keys
    input: key_panel
    output: set of protected key_colors
  - action: copy_grid
    input: main_grid
    output: initial output_grid
  - action: iterate_and_stamp
    target: output_grid
    unit: 2x2 blocks
    condition: check if any pixel within the corresponding 2x2 block in the input main_grid belongs to the set of key_colors.
    effect:
      - if condition is FALSE: overwrite the 2x2 block in the output_grid with the stamp_color (azure).
      - if condition is TRUE: leave the 2x2 block in the output_grid unchanged (preserving original colors).

relationships:
  - type: protection
    subject: pixels in the main_grid matching key_colors
    effect: prevent overwriting by the azure stamp in their containing 2x2 block.
  - type: spatial_grouping
    granularity: 2x2 blocks
    purpose: determines the unit of checking and potential stamping.
