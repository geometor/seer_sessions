            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code (`code_00.py`) attempted to implement the observed logic: identify \"protected\" colors from a key panel and stamp 2x2 blocks in the main grid with azure (8) unless the block contained a protected color. However, the execution results show a catastrophic failure, where the output grids are almost entirely filled with azure (8) and reported as the wrong size.\n\nThe discrepancy between the manually traced logic (which seems to match the input/output examples) and the execution results is significant. This suggests either:\n1.  A subtle flaw in the code's implementation of the logic (e.g., type mismatch, scope issue, off-by-one error not caught in manual review).\n2.  An error in the interpretation of the \"protected color\" rule or the stamping condition.\n3.  An issue with the testing environment or the reporting of results (the size mismatch reported alongside near-uniform incorrect content is particularly suspicious).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Core Logic:** Re-confirm the steps: split grid, extract keys, iterate 2x2 blocks, check protection, stamp if unprotected. This logic still appears consistent with the visual transformation in the examples.\n2.  **Refine Key Extraction:** Ensure the definition of \"protected colors\" is precise. The current definition (non-white, non-gray, adjacent to white in the key panel) seems robust and correctly identifies the colors {1, 2, 4, 6} for example 1, {2, 3, 4, 6} for example 2, and {2, 3, 4, 6} for example 3.\n3.  **Refine Stamping Condition:** The condition is: stamp a 2x2 block if *none* of its pixels in the input main grid match *any* of the protected colors. This also seems consistent with visual examples where backgrounds are stamped but specific colored shapes are preserved.\n4.  **Address Size Discrepancy:** The code is designed to return a grid the size of the input's `main_grid`. The failure report indicates the output size was incorrect. While the provided code *should* produce the correct size, this discrepancy must be noted. It might stem from an execution error or misreporting, but the intended output size is that of the `main_grid`.\n5.  **Document Clearly:** Update the YAML and natural language program to reflect the refined understanding, emphasizing the separation, key extraction, and conditional 2x2 stamping. Assume the code's *intent* was correct based on the visual examples, even if the execution failed.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's use code execution to verify the extraction of protected colors and grid dimensions, assuming the provided `code_00.py` structure.\n\n"

            "text": "**Analysis of Corrected Code Execution:**\n\nAha! The code execution reveals the critical error. The `_find_separator_row` function found the separator at index `0` for all examples. Looking back at the input data, the *first* row (index 0) is indeed all gray (5) pixels.\n\nThis caused:\n1.  `key_panel = input_np[:0, :]`, resulting in an empty key panel.\n2.  `main_grid = input_np[1:, :]`, making the main grid almost the entire input grid (rows 1 to end).\n3.  `_extract_protected_colors` received an empty `key_panel` and returned an empty set `protected_colors = {}`.\n4.  In the main loop, `pixel_color in protected_colors` was *always* false because the set was empty.\n5.  `is_protected` was always false.\n6.  The `if not is_protected:` condition was always true, causing every 2x2 block in the `output_grid` (which was a copy of rows 1-end of the input) to be overwritten with azure (8).\n\nThis perfectly explains the erroneous output (all 8s) and also the size mismatch, because the `main_grid` used by the code (rows 1-end) was different from the intended `main_grid` (rows below the *correct* separator). The correct separator is at index 5 in all examples.\n\n**Resolution:** Modify `_find_separator_row` to find the *correct* separator row, not just the first one (which seems to be an outer border). It should look for a row of all 5s that is *not* the first row, or perhaps the one immediately preceding the main content block. Given the structure, finding the *last* row of all 5s before the main content starts seems appropriate. Alternatively, find the first row of all 5s that has non-5 rows above and below it, but simpler is likely finding the last one overall. Let's redefine it to find the last such row.\n\n**Updated Strategy:** Correct the `_find_separator_row` logic. The rest of the transformation logic appears sound based on manual tracing against the intended `main_grid` and `protected_colors`.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation (Revised):**\n\n"

The window is defined by its top-left corner coordinates (r, c).
