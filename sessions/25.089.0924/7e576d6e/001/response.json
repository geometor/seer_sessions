Identify the path color and the two endpoint coordinates. This color appears exactly twice and is different from the background color.\n3. Identify obstacle colors (any color that is not the background or path color).\n4. Find the shortest path between the two endpoints using Breadth-First Search (BFS). The path can only move horizontally or vertically onto cells containing the background color. Obstacle cells cannot be part of the path.\n5. Create an output grid by copying the input grid.\n6. Draw the found shortest path onto the output grid using the path color, changing the color of the background cells that form the path.
