Identify the path color and the two endpoint coordinates. This color appears exactly twice and is different from the background color.\n3. Identify obstacle pixels/colors (any color that is not the background or path color).\n4. Find the shortest path between the two endpoints using Breadth-First Search (BFS). The path can only move horizontally or vertically onto cells containing the background color. Obstacle cells cannot be part of the path. The target endpoint cell is considered traversable even though it's not background color.\n5. Create an output grid by copying the input grid.\n6. Draw the found shortest path onto the output grid using the path color, changing the color of the background cells that form the path. The endpoints remain their original color.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_colors_and_endpoints(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies background color, path color, endpoint coordinates,\n    and obstacle colors from the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (background_color, path_color, endpoints, obstacle_colors)\n               Returns None for path_color or endpoints if not found correctly.\n               obstacle_colors is a set.\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the grid is empty, path color is not found, or\n                    exactly two endpoints for the path color are not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    if grid.size == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Grid is empty.\")\n\n    unique_colors, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)\n    color_counts = dict(zip(unique_colors, counts))\n\n    # Background color is the most frequent\n    background_color = max(color_counts, key=color_counts.get)\n\n    path_color = None\n    endpoints = []\n    obstacle_colors = set()\n\n    # Find path color (appears twice) and obstacle colors\n    for color, count in color_counts.items():\n        if color == background_color:\n            continue\n        if count == 2:\n            # Assuming only one color appears exactly twice based on examples.\n            # If multiple exist, this selects the last one encountered.\n            path_color = color\n        else:\n            obstacle_colors.add(color) # Treat any other non-background color as obstacle\n\n    if path_color is None:\n        # Check if maybe the \"path color\" was actually the most frequent\n        # This can happen if the path is very long and endpoints are the same color\n        # as the background.
