Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the background color (most frequent color).
2. Identify the path color (appears exactly twice) and the coordinates of these two path endpoints.
3. Identify obstacle pixels (any color that is not background or path color).
4. Find the shortest path between the two endpoints using A* Search (or BFS if A* proves too complex/unnecessary, but BFS timed out previously). The path uses only horizontal/vertical moves onto background-colored cells, avoiding obstacle cells.
5. Create an output grid by copying the input grid.
6. Draw the found shortest path onto the output grid using the path color, replacing the background color along the path.
