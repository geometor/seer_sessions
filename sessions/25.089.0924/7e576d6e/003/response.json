Identify the background color (most frequent color).\n2. Identify the path color (appears exactly twice) and the coordinates of these two path endpoints.\n3. Identify obstacle pixels (any color that is not background or path color).\n4.

The path uses only horizontal/vertical moves onto background-colored cells, avoiding obstacle cells.\n5. Create an output grid by copying the input grid.\n6.
