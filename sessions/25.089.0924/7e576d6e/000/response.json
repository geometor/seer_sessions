These serve as start and end points for a path.\n    *   The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that a path has been drawn connecting the two unique start/end pixels.\n    *   The path is drawn using the same color as the start/end pixels.\n    *   The path only traverses pixels that were originally the background color in the input grid.\n    *   The path avoids crossing any of the obstacle pixels.\n    *   The path appears to be a shortest path between the start and end points, allowing only horizontal and vertical movement (no diagonal steps).\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
