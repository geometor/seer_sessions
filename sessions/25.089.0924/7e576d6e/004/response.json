All training examples use 30x30 grids, the maximum allowed size. This large grid size, potentially combined with long or complex paths, likely led to the A* search exploring too many nodes within the time limit.\n    *   The strategy is to refine the understanding of the task elements and constraints based on all examples and maintain the A* search approach, assuming the timeout was due to scale rather than a fundamental flaw in the algorithm choice. The natural language program and YAML facts will be updated for clarity and completeness based on all examples.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    "
