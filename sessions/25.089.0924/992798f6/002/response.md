Okay, skimage is not available. Let's implement a standard Bresenham algorithm carefully.

Standard Bresenham (adapted for row, col):
Start: (r1, c1), End: (r2, c2)
dr = r2 - r1
dc = c2 - c1
sr = 1 if dr > 0 else -1
sc = 1 if dc > 0 else -1
dr = abs(dr)
dc = abs(dc)

if dc > dr: # Slope < 1, iterate over columns
    err = 2 * dr - dc
    r = r1
    for c in range(c1, c2 + sc, sc):
        coords.append((r, c))
        if err > 0:
            r += sr
            err -= 2 * dc
        err += 2 * dr
else: # Slope >= 1, iterate over rows
    err = 2 * dc - dr
    c = c1
    for r in range(r1, r2 + sr, sr):
        coords.append((r, c))
        if err > 0:
            c += sc
            err -= 2 * dr
        err += 2 * dc

Let's trace Example 1: (r1, c1) = (10, 1), (r2, c2) = (3, 11)
dr = 3 - 10 = -7
dc = 11 - 1 = 10
sr = -1
sc = 1
abs_dr = 7
abs_dc = 10

abs_dc (10) > abs_dr (7) -> Iterate over columns.
err = 2 * abs_dr - abs_dc = 2 * 7 - 10 = 14 - 10 = 4
r = 10
coords = []

c = 1: append (10, 1). err = 4. Not > 0. err += 2*dr = 4 + 14 = 18.
c = 2: append (10, 2). err = 18. Is > 0. r += sr (r=9). err -= 2*dc = 18 - 20 = -2. err += 2*dr = -2 + 14 = 12.
c = 3: append (9, 3). err = 12. Is > 0. r += sr (r=8). err -= 2*dc = 12 - 20 = -8. err += 2*dr = -8 + 14 = 6.
c = 4: append (8, 4). err = 6. Is > 0. r += sr (r=7). err -= 2*dc = 6 - 20 = -14. err += 2*dr = -14 + 14 = 0.
c = 5: append (7, 5). err = 0. Not > 0. err += 2*dr = 0 + 14 = 14.
c = 6: append (7, 6). err = 14. Is > 0. r += sr (r=6). err -= 2*dc = 14 - 20 = -6. err += 2*dr = -6 + 14 = 8.
c = 7: append (6, 7). err = 8. Is > 0. r += sr (r=5). err -= 2*dc = 8 - 20 = -12. err += 2*dr = -12 + 14 = 2.
c = 8: append (5, 8). err = 2. Is > 0. r += sr (r=4). err -= 2*dc = 2 - 20 = -18. err += 2*dr = -18 + 14 = -4.
c = 9: append (4, 9). err = -4. Not > 0. err += 2*dr = -4 + 14 = 10.
c = 10: append (4, 10). err = 10. Is > 0. r += sr (r=3). err -= 2*dc = 10 - 20 = -10. err += 2*dr = -10 + 14 = 4.
c = 11: append (3, 11). err = 4. Not > 0. err += 2*dr = 4 + 14 = 18.
End loop.

Full Path (Bresenham): (10, 1), (10, 2), (9, 3), (8, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (6, 7), (5, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10), (3, 11)
Path excluding ends: (10, 2), (9, 3), (8, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (6, 7), (5, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10)

Expected Path Coordinates: (9, 3), (8, 4), (7, 5), (6, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10)

Still not matching! Comparing Bresenham vs Expected:
Bresenham Only: (10, 2), (7, 6), (6, 7), (5, 8)
Expected Only: (6, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8)
Common: (9, 3), (8, 4), (7, 5), (4, 9), (4, 10)

The algorithm used in ARC seems slightly different from standard Bresenham, especially around diagonal steps vs. cardinal steps when the error term is near a decision boundary, or maybe how it handles endpoints.

Let's reconsider the "Midpoint circle algorithm" idea adapted for lines, or maybe Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm (anti-aliased, probably not). What about a simple DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer)?

DDA Algorithm:
Start: (r1, c1), End: (r2, c2)
dr = r2 - r1
dc = c2 - c1
steps = max(abs(dr), abs(dc))
r_inc = dr / steps
c_inc = dc / steps
r = r1
c = c1
coords = []
for i in range(steps + 1):
    coords.append((round(r), round(c)))
    r += r_inc
    c += c_inc

Let's trace Example 1: (r1, c1) = (10, 1), (r2, c2) = (3, 11)
dr = -7, dc = 10
steps = max(abs(-7), abs(10)) = 10
r_inc = -7 / 10 = -0.7
c_inc = 10 / 10 = 1.0
r = 10.0, c = 1.0
coords = []
Using standard round (0.5 up):

i=0: append (round(10.0), round(1.0)) = (10, 1). r=9.3, c=2.0
i=1: append (round(9.3), round(2.0)) = (9, 2). r=8.6, c=3.0
i=2: append (round(8.6), round(3.0)) = (9, 3). r=7.9, c=4.0 -- Match expected!
i=3: append (round(7.9), round(4.0)) = (8, 4). r=7.2, c=5.0 -- Match expected!
i=4: append (round(7.2), round(5.0)) = (7, 5). r=6.5, c=6.0 -- Match expected!
i=5: append (round(6.5), round(6.0)) = (7, 6). r=5.8, c=7.0 -- No Match! Expected (6, 6)
i=6: append (round(5.8), round(7.0)) = (6, 7). r=5.1, c=8.0 -- No Match! Expected (5, 7), (4, 7)
i=7: append (round(5.1), round(8.0)) = (5, 8). r=4.4, c=9.0 -- No Match! Expected (4, 8)
i=8: append (round(4.4), round(9.0)) = (4, 9). r=3.7, c=10.0 -- Match expected!
i=9: append (round(3.7), round(10.0)) = (4, 10). r=3.0, c=11.0 -- Match expected!
i=10: append (round(3.0), round(11.0)) = (3, 11). r=2.3, c=12.0

DDA Path (excluding ends): (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (6, 7), (5, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10)
Expected Path:             (9, 3), (8, 4), (7, 5), (6, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10)

DDA is also not quite right. The discrepancy seems to be around how fractional parts are handled or how steps are chosen.

Let's examine the expected path pixels themselves more closely.
Example 1: (9,3), (8,4), (7,5), (6,6), (5,7), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (4,10)
Example 2: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,3), (9,4), (10,5), (11,6), (12,7)
Example 3: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (10,5), (11,4)
Example 4: (2,10), (3,9), (4,8), (5,7), (6,6), (7,5), (8,4), (9,4), (10,4), (11,4), (12,4)

These look like paths generated by Bresenham's algorithm, but perhaps a slightly different variant regarding tie-breaking or initial error setup. The implementation in the previous attempt might have had a bug. Let's re-implement the Bresenham logic used in the trace above carefully.


```python
def get_line_coords_bresenham(r1, c1, r2, c2):
    coords = []
    dr = r2 - r1
    dc = c2 - c1
    sr = 1 if dr > 0 else -1
    sc = 1 if dc > 0 else -1
    dr = abs(dr)
    dc = abs(dc)
    
    r, c = r1, c1 # Start point

    if dc > dr: # Slope < 1 (more horizontal)
        err = 2 * dr - dc
        for _ in range(dc): # Need dc steps to reach target column
            c += sc # Move horizontally
            if err >= 0: # Threshold to move vertically
                r += sr
                err -= 2 * dc
            err += 2 * dr
            coords.append((r, c)) # Add the point *after* the move
    else: # Slope >= 1 (more vertical)
        err = 2 * dc - dr
        for _ in range(dr): # Need dr steps to reach target row
            r += sr # Move vertically
            if err >= 0: # Threshold to move horizontally
                c += sc
                err -= 2 * dr
            err += 2 * dc
            coords.append((r, c)) # Add the point *after* the move
            
    # The loop generates points *between* start and end.
    # Check if the last point generated is indeed the end point's neighbor
    # This implementation generates points starting from the neighbor of (r1, c1)
    # up to and including (r2, c2).
    
    # Let's rethink. The previous manual trace generated points *including* start and end.
    # Let's align the implementation with that trace.

    coords_trace = [] # Store points including start and end
    
    r_curr, c_curr = r1, c1
    coords_trace.append((r_curr, c_curr)) # Add start point
    
    if dc > dr: # Slope < 1
        err = 2 * dr - dc
        while c_curr != c2:
            c_curr += sc
            if err >= 0:
                r_curr += sr
                err -= 2 * dc
            err += 2 * dr
            coords_trace.append((r_curr, c_curr))
    else: # Slope >= 1
        err = 2 * dc - dr
        while r_curr != r2:
            r_curr += sr
            if err >= 0:
                c_curr += sc
                err -= 2 * dr
            err += 2 * dc
            coords_trace.append((r_curr, c_curr))
            
    return coords_trace # Return full list including start and end
```


Let's re-trace Example 1 with this implementation logic:
Start: (10, 1), End: (3, 11) -> dc=10, dr=-7 -> abs_dc=10, abs_dr=7. dc > dr. sc=1, sr=-1.
err = 2*7 - 10 = 4
r, c = 10, 1
coords = [(10, 1)]

c=1 != 11: c=2. err=4 >= 0? Yes. r=9. err -= 2*10 = 4-20=-16. err += 2*7 = -16+14=-2. append (9, 2).
c=2 != 11: c=3. err=-2 >= 0? No. err += 2*7 = -2+14=12. append (9, 3). -- Match expected!
c=3 != 11: c=4. err=12 >= 0? Yes. r=8. err -= 2*10 = 12-20=-8. err += 2*7 = -8+14=6. append (8, 4). -- Match expected!
c=4 != 11: c=5. err=6 >= 0? Yes. r=7. err -= 2*10 = 6-20=-14. err += 2*7 = -14+14=0. append (7, 5). -- Match expected!
c=5 != 11: c=6. err=0 >= 0? Yes. r=6. err -= 2*10 = 0-20=-20. err += 2*7 = -20+14=-6. append (6, 6). -- Match expected!
c=6 != 11: c=7. err=-6 >= 0? No. err += 2*7 = -6+14=8. append (6, 7). -- No match! Expected (5, 7), (4, 7)
c=7 != 11: c=8. err=8 >= 0? Yes. r=5. err -= 2*10 = 8-20=-12. err += 2*7 = -12+14=2. append (5, 8). -- No match! Expected (4, 8)
c=8 != 11: c=9. err=2 >= 0? Yes. r=4. err -= 2*10 = 2-20=-18. err += 2*7 = -18+14=-4. append (4, 9). -- Match expected!
c=9 != 11: c=10. err=-4 >= 0? No. err += 2*7 = -4+14=10. append (4, 10). -- Match expected!
c=10 != 11: c=11. err=10 >= 0? Yes. r=3. err -= 2*10 = 10-20=-10. err += 2*7 = -10+14=4. append (3, 11). -- End point.
c=11 == 11: Stop.

Path generated by this Bresenham: (10,1), (9,2), (9,3), (8,4), (7,5), (6,6), (6,7), (5,8), (4,9), (4,10), (3,11)
Path excluding ends: (9,2), (9,3), (8,4), (7,5), (6,6), (6,7), (5,8), (4,9), (4,10)
Expected Path:        (9,3), (8,4), (7,5), (6,6), (5,7), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (4,10)

Still doesn't match. The ARC examples might be using a variant where the decision `err >= 0` is handled differently (e.g., `err > 0`), or the error update is different, or maybe it's not Bresenham at all.

Let's analyze the movements in the expected path again.
Example 1: (10, 1) to (3, 11). Delta (-7, 10).
Path: (9, 3), (8, 4), (7, 5), (6, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10)
Steps: diag, diag, diag, diag, vert, horiz, horiz, horiz. Missing steps from (10,1) to (9,3). Could be (10,2), (9,2), (9,3) or (9,1), (9,2), (9,3) or (10,2), (10,3), (9,3)... It's ambiguous near the start/end if we only look at intermediate points.

Let's assume the path includes start and end points, and look at the sequence of cells visited.
Example 1: (10,1)->...->(9,3)->(8,4)->(7,5)->(6,6)->(5,7)->(4,7)->(4,8)->(4,9)->(4,10)->...->(3,11)
The path seems thick or makes strange turns sometimes.
(5,7) -> (4,7) is a vertical step.
(4,7) -> (4,8) is a horizontal step.

Could it be plotting *all* pixels intersected by a line of non-zero width? No, that would be thicker usually.

Could it be drawing two Bresenham lines? One from start to end, one from end to start, and taking the union?
Line 1 (S->E): (10,1), (9,2)*, (9,3), (8,4), (7,5), (6,6), (6,7)*, (5,8)*, (4,9), (4,10), (3,11) - From trace above. Starred (*) are different from expected intermediate path.
Line 2 (E->S): (r1, c1) = (3, 11), (r2, c2) = (10, 1). Delta (7, -10). abs_dc=10, abs_dr=7. dc > dr. sc=-1, sr=1.
err = 2*7 - 10 = 4
r, c = 3, 11
coords = [(3, 11)]

c=11 != 1: c=10. err=4 >= 0? Yes. r=4. err -= 2*10 = -16. err += 2*7 = -2. append (4, 10).
c=10 != 1: c=9. err=-2 >= 0? No. err += 2*7 = 12. append (4, 9).
c=9 != 1: c=8. err=12 >= 0? Yes. r=5. err -= 2*10 = -8. err += 2*7 = 6. append (5, 8).
c=8 != 1: c=7. err=6 >= 0? Yes. r=6. err -= 2*10 = -14. err += 2*7 = 0. append (6, 7).
c=7 != 1: c=6. err=0 >= 0? Yes. r=7. err -= 2*10 = -20. err += 2*7 = -6. append (7, 6).
c=6 != 1: c=5. err=-6 >= 0? No. err += 2*7 = 8. append (7, 5).
c=5 != 1: c=4. err=8 >= 0? Yes. r=8. err -= 2*10 = -12. err += 2*7 = 2. append (8, 4).
c=4 != 1: c=3. err=2 >= 0? Yes. r=9. err -= 2*10 = -18. err += 2*7 = -4. append (9, 3).
c=3 != 1: c=2. err=-4 >= 0? No. err += 2*7 = 10. append (9, 2).
c=2 != 1: c=1. err=10 >= 0? Yes. r=10. err -= 2*10 = -10. err += 2*7 = 4. append (10, 1).
c=1 == 1: Stop.

Path (E->S): (3,11), (4,10), (4,9), (5,8), (6,7), (7,6), (7,5), (8,4), (9,3), (9,2), (10,1)
Intermediate (E->S): (4,10), (4,9), (5,8), (6,7), (7,6), (7,5), (8,4), (9,3), (9,2)

Union of intermediate paths S->E and E->S:
S->E: (9,2), (9,3), (8,4), (7,5), (6,6), (6,7), (5,8), (4,9), (4,10)
E->S: (4,10), (4,9), (5,8), (6,7), (7,6), (7,5), (8,4), (9,3), (9,2)
Union: (9,2), (9,3), (8,4), (7,5), (6,6), (6,7), (5,8), (4,9), (4,10), (7,6)

Expected Path: (9,3), (8,4), (7,5), (6,6), (5,7), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (4,10)

Still not matching. Let's try the `code_execution` to get the exact coordinates.

Need a helper function to extract coordinates of a specific color.

```python
import numpy as np
def get_coords_for_color(grid, color):
    return set(tuple(coord) for coord in np.argwhere(np.array(grid) == color))
```


Now get coordinates for each example.
