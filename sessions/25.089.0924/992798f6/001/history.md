*   **Perception:** The task involves drawing a path between two specific colored points on a grid.
    *   Each input grid contains exactly one blue pixel (1) and one red pixel (2) on a white background (0).
    *   The output grid is the same size as the input and contains the original blue and red pixels.
    *   Additionally, the output grid contains a path of green pixels (3) connecting the blue and red pixels.
    *   The green path appears to represent the pixels that lie on the straight line segment connecting the centers of the blue and red pixels, excluding the start (blue) and end (red) pixels themselves.
    *   The path generation seems consistent with standard line-drawing algorithms (like Bresenham's line algorithm or similar variants used to rasterize lines).

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - object: grid
        description: A 2D array of pixels with values 0-9 representing colors.
      - object: blue_pixel
        value: 1
        property: unique identifier for the start point.
        location: dynamically identified in each input grid.
      - object: red_pixel
        value: 2
        property: unique identifier for the end point.
        location: dynamically identified in each input grid.
      - object: green_pixel
        value: 3
        property: color used to draw the path in the output grid.
      - object: background_pixel
        value: 0
        property: color white, fills the rest of the grid.
    actions:
      - action: locate

        inputs:
          - grid
          - blue_pixel (value 1)
          - red_pixel (value 2)
        outputs:
          - coordinates of blue_pixel (start_point)
          - coordinates of red_pixel (end_point)
      - action: draw_line
        actor: agent
        inputs:
          - start_point (coordinates)
          - end_point (coordinates)
        outputs:
          - set of coordinates (path_pixels) representing the pixels intersected by the line segment between start_point and end_point.
      - action: color_path
        actor: agent
        inputs:
          - input_grid
          - path_pixels
          - start_point
          - end_point
        outputs:
          - output_grid
        description: Creates the output grid by coloring the path_pixels green (3), excluding the start_point and end_point coordinates, while preserving the original blue and red pixels.
    relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: The green pixels form a path connecting the blue pixel to the red pixel.
      - type: procedural
        description: The path is determined by the geometric line segment between the blue and red pixel locations.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the coordinates (row, column) of the blue pixel (value 1) in the input grid, designating it as the start point.
    2.  Identify the coordinates (row, column) of the red pixel (value 2) in the input grid, designating it as the end point.
    3.  Determine the set of all grid coordinates that lie on the straight line segment connecting the start point and the end point. Use a line-drawing algorithm (like Bresenham's) to find these coordinates.
    4.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    5.  Iterate through the set of coordinates identified in step 3.
    6.  For each coordinate in the set, if it is *not* the start point coordinate and *not* the end point coordinate, change the color of the pixel at that coordinate in the output grid to green (3).
    7.  Return the modified output grid.
