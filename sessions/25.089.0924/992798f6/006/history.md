*   **Perception:** The task involves drawing a path between two specific colored points on a grid.
    *   Each input grid contains exactly one blue pixel (1) and one red pixel (2) on a white background (0).
    *   The output grid is the same size as the input and contains the original blue and red pixels.
    *   Additionally, the output grid contains a path of green pixels (3) connecting the blue and red pixels.
    *   The green path appears to represent the pixels that lie on the straight line segment connecting the centers of the blue and red pixels, excluding the start (blue) and end (red) pixels themselves.
    *   The path generation seems consistent with standard line-drawing algorithms (like Bresenham's line algorithm or similar variants used to rasterize lines).

*   **Facts:**

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the coordinates (row, column) of the blue pixel (value 1) in the input grid, designating it as the start point.
    2.  Identify the coordinates (row, column) of the red pixel (value 2) in the input grid, designating it as the end point.
    3.  Determine the set of all grid coordinates that lie on the straight line segment connecting the start point and the end point. Use a line-drawing algorithm (like Bresenham's) to find these coordinates.
    4.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    5.  Iterate through the set of coordinates identified in step 3.
    6.  For each coordinate in the set, if it is *not* the start point coordinate and *not* the end point coordinate, change the color of the pixel at that coordinate in the output grid to green (3).
    7.  Return the modified output grid.

"""
This module transforms an input grid according to the following rule:
1. Identify the unique blue pixel (value 1) and the unique red pixel (value 2) in the input grid. These represent the start and end points.
2. Calculate the sequence of grid coordinates that form a path connecting the start and end points using a specific grid-based line drawing algorithm observed in the ARC examples. Note: Standard Bresenham variants tested do not perfectly replicate these paths; the exact algorithm requires precise implementation matching the examples.
3. Create an output grid by copying the input grid.
4. Color the pixels corresponding to the calculated path coordinates green (value 3), *excluding* the coordinates of the original blue (start) and red (end) pixels.
5. Return the modified grid.
