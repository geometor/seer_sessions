            "text": "*   **Observations from Metrics:**\n    *   The path does not always take diagonal steps even when possible (unlike standard Bresenham which often prefers diagonal movement when error allows).\n    *   The paths often contain segments of purely horizontal or vertical movement, especially when the line is closer to being horizontal or vertical.\n    *   Example 1: Path from (10, 1) to (3, 11). Delta R = -7, Delta C = 10. Path starts diagonally ((9,2), (8,3), (7,4), (6,5), (5,6)) then seems to prioritize column steps ((4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (4,10)).\n    *   Example 2: Path from (13, 8) to (1, 1). Delta R = -12, Delta C = -7. Path starts almost vertically ((2,2) to (7,2)) then transitions to diagonal steps ((8,3) to (12,7)).\n    *   Example 3: Path from (12, 3) to (1, 6). Delta R = -11, Delta C = 3. Path is almost vertical ((2,5) to (10,5)) with only small column shifts at the start and end ((11,4)).\n    *   Example 4: Path from (1, 11) to (13, 3). Delta R = 12, Delta C = -8. Path starts diagonally ((2,10) to (8,4)) then becomes vertical ((9,4) to (12,4)).\n\n    The pattern suggests an algorithm that might prioritize movement along the major axis (the direction with the larger delta) and only takes steps along the minor axis at specific intervals, potentially related to rounding or integer division of coordinates along the ideal line. It looks like a variation of Bresenham or perhaps a simpler DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) approach based on rounding floating-point steps.\n\n*   **Updated Facts (YAML):**\n    "
