Min row=3, max row=10. Min col=1, max col=11.\nIterate through pixels (r, c) in this box. Calculate distance from pixel center (r+0.5, c+0.5) to the line segment. If distance is small (e.g., <= 0.5), include the pixel? This is complex.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"steps\" idea.\nExample 1: (10, 1) to (3, 11). Need (-7 rows, +10 cols). Total 17 \"units\" of movement? Ratio -0.7.\nExpected Path: (9,2), (9,3), (8,4), (8,5), (7,6), (6,7), (6,8), (5,9), (4,9), (4,10)\nSteps: (-1,+1), (0,+1), (-1,+1), (0,+1), (-1,+1), (-1,+1), (0,+1), (-1,+1), (-1,0), (0,+1)\nThere are 10 intermediate points.\n\nExample 2: (13, 8) to (1, 1). Need (-12 rows, -7 cols). Ratio 12/7 approx 1.7.\nExpected Path: (12,7), (11,7), (10,6), (9,6), (8,5), (7,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,2)\nSteps: (-1,-1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,-1) - This interpretation doesn't match the list. Let's recalculate steps:\n(13,8) -> (12,7) Step: (-1,-1)\n(12,7) -> (11,7) Step: (-1, 0)\n(11,7) -> (10,6) Step: (-1,-1)\n(10,6) -> (9,6) Step: (-1, 0)\n(9,6) -> (8,5) Step: (-1,-1)\n(8,5) -> (7,5) Step: (-1, 0)\n(7,5) -> (6,4) Step: (-1,-1)\n(6,4) -> (5,4) Step: (-1, 0)\n(5,4) -> (4,3) Step: (-1,-1)\n(4,3) -> (3,3) Step: (-1, 0)\n(3,3) -> (2,2) Step: (-1,-1)\n(2,2) -> (1,1) Step: (-1,-1)\nTotal 11 intermediate points. Notice the pattern: Steps alternate between (-1,-1) and (-1,0). This path prioritizes the larger delta (row).\n\nExample 3: (12, 3) to (1, 6). Need (-11 rows, +3 cols). Ratio -11/3 approx -3.67.\nExpected Path: (11,4), (10,4), (9,4), (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\nSteps:\n(12,3) -> (11,4) Step: (-1,+1)\n(11,4) -> (10,4) Step: (-1, 0)\n(10,4) -> (9,4) Step: (-1, 0)\n(9,4) -> (8,4) Step: (-1, 0)\n(8,4) -> (7,4) Step: (-1, 0)\n(7,4) -> (6,4) Step: (-1, 0)\n(6,4) -> (5,4) Step: (-1, 0)\n(5,4) -> (4,5) Step: (-1,+1)\n(4,5) -> (3,5) Step: (-1, 0)\n(3,5) -> (2,5) Step: (-1, 0)\n(2,5) -> (1,6) Step: (-1,+1)\nTotal 10 intermediate points. Here, the pattern is less obvious but still favors steps in the dominant direction (row). It takes 3 diagonal steps and 7 vertical steps. Where do the diagonal steps occur? When the fractional part of the ideal position crosses 0.5?\n\nLet's formalize the \"prioritize larger delta\" idea:\n1. Find deltas: dr = r1 - r0, dc = c1 - c0\n2. Determine dominant direction: If abs(dr) >= abs(dc), row is dominant. Else, column is dominant.\n3. Iterate from 0 to max(abs(dr), abs(dc)) - 1 (number of steps needed in dominant direction).\n4. In each step `i`:\n   - Calculate the ideal position along the non-dominant axis.\n   - Example: If row is dominant, calculate ideal_c = c0 + dc * (i+1) / abs(dr). Round ideal_c to get the column for this step. Row is r0 + sign(dr)*(i+1).\n   - This seems like standard Bresenham again.\n\nLet's try the `line-drawing` library's implementation which might handle different cases.\n"

The line-drawing logic used in ARC for this task is specific and not one of the most common variants I've tried.\n\nGiven the failure of standard algorithms, let's reconsider the visual patterns:\n- Example 1: Path seems 'thickened' or 'smoothed' compared to standard Bresenham. Notice (9,2)/(9,3), (8,4)/(8,5), (6,7)/(6,8).\n- Example 2: Long vertical segments (col 2). Path moves mostly vertically, then shifts column when necessary.\n- Example 3: Long vertical segments (col 4 or 5). Similar logic to Ex 2.\n- Example 4: Long horizontal segments (row 4). Path moves mostly horizontally, then shifts row when necessary.\n\nThis suggests an algorithm that accumulates error but perhaps makes steps in *both* directions if the error term crosses a threshold for *both*? Or maybe it calculates all pixels within a certain distance (e.g., perpendicular distance < 0.5 or similar) of the true line segment?\n\nLet's assume the ARC developers used a readily available algorithm, perhaps from a specific graphics library or context (like older game development, grid-based games).\n\nMaybe `line-aa` (anti-aliased line) which calculates pixel coverage? That seems too complex.\n\nWhat if we generate *all* 8-neighbor intermediate pixels between steps?\nExample 1 trace (Expected):\n(10, 1) -> (9, 2) -> (9, 3) -> (8, 4) -> (8, 5) -> (7, 6) -> (6, 7) -> (6, 8) -> (5, 9) -> (4, 9) -> (4, 10) -> (3, 11)\nThis sequence *is* the full set of expected green pixels plus the start and end points. The crucial part is *how* this sequence is generated.\n\nLet's re-examine the `get_line_coords_rc` implementation. It *does* potentially move both r and c in one loop iteration if `e2 >= -dc` and `e2 <= dr` are both true. This leads to diagonal steps. If only one is true, it's a cardinal step.\n\nConsider the logic again:\n`err = dr - dc`\n`e2 = 2 * err`\nIf `e2 >= -dc`: means `2*(dr-dc) >= -dc` => `2dr - 2dc >= -dc` => `2dr >= dc`. Related to moving vertically (row step).\nIf `e2 <= dr`: means `2*(dr-dc) <= dr` => `2dr - 2dc <= dr` => `dr <= 2dc`. Related to moving horizontally (col step).\n\nMaybe the *order* of checks or updates matters?\nIn `get_line_coords_rc`:\n1. Check vertical condition (`e2 >= -dc`) -> if true, update `err`, move `r`.\n2. Check horizontal condition (`e2 <= dr`) -> if true, update `err`, move `c`.\n\nWhat if we swap the order?\nOr what if the error update happens only *after* deciding which step(s) to take?\n\nLet's try implementing the line logic from the `redblobgames` line drawing article, which covers different variants. The \"walk grid\" approach seems relevant. Start at pixel A, take steps towards pixel B (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) that minimize distance or follow Bresenham error.\n\nConsider a simplified approach: calculate the floating point line. For each step along the major axis, find the corresponding coordinate on the minor axis using the line equation and round it.\n\nExample 1: (10, 1) to (3, 11). dc=10, dr=7. Major axis is column.\nc=1: r=10 (start)\nc=2: r = 10 + (-7)*(2-1)/10 = 10 - 0.7 = 9.3 -> round to 9. Point (9, 2)\nc=3: r = 10 + (-7)*(3-1)/10 = 10 - 1.4 = 8.6 -> round to 9. Point (9, 3)\nc=4: r = 10 + (-7)*(4-1)/10 = 10 - 2.1 = 7.9 -> round to 8. Point (8, 4)\nc=5: r = 10 + (-7)*(5-1)/10 = 10 - 2.8 = 7.2 -> round to 7. Point (7, 5) - **Doesn't match expected (8, 5)**\nThis simple float rounding also fails.\n\nThe exact algorithm remains elusive, but it produces paths that look like \"thickened\" or grid-constrained versions of straight lines. It's deterministic. The failure of standard Bresenham variants suggests a specific, perhaps slightly unconventional implementation detail.\n\nGiven the consistent failure, the strategy is to replace the `get_line_coords_rc` function with one that correctly replicates the observed paths. Since the exact algorithm isn't obvious, the most pragmatic approach for the coder phase might be to implement a function that explicitly generates the correct path coordinates observed in the training examples, hoping the underlying pattern generalizes. However, for the dreamer phase, I should describe the *observed characteristics* of the path accurately.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis that the task involves drawing a straight line using a standard algorithm like Bresenham was incorrect. The provided implementation (`get_line_coords_rc`) failed to replicate the specific pixel paths shown in the training outputs. The paths in the examples appear to be deterministic grid-based approximations of a line segment, but they don't conform to the tested standard Bresenham variants or simple floating-point rounding methods. The paths sometimes contain adjacent pixels in the same row or column, suggesting a \"thicker\" or step-wise generation logic that differs from minimal line algorithms. The core task remains finding the blue and red pixels and drawing a green path between them (excluding endpoints), but the specific algorithm for path generation needs correction.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nUsing code execution to test standard Bresenham variants confirmed they do not produce the required paths.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Start=(10, 1), End=(3, 11). Expected Green Count=10. Code_00 Green Count=9. Wiki Bresenham Green Count=9. Sets differ.\n*   **Example 2:** Start=(13, 8), End=(1, 1). Expected Green Count=11. Code_00 Green Count=11. Wiki Bresenham Green Count=11. Sets differ.\n*   **Example 3:** Start=(12, 3), End=(1, 6). Expected Green Count=10. Code_00 Green Count=10. Wiki Bresenham Green Count=10. Sets differ.\n*   **Example 4:** Start=(1, 11), End=(13, 3). Expected Green Count=11. Code_00 Green Count=11. Wiki Bresenham Green Count=11. Sets differ.\n\nWhile the number of green pixels sometimes matched between the failed code/Wiki Bresenham and the expected output (Examples 2, 3, 4), the specific pixel coordinates chosen were different, confirming the algorithm logic is the point of failure.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
