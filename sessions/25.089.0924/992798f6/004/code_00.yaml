elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with values 0-9 representing colors.
  - object: blue_pixel
    value: 1
    property: unique identifier for the start point of the path.
    location: dynamically identified in each input grid (exactly one).
  - object: red_pixel
    value: 2
    property: unique identifier for the end point of the path.
    location: dynamically identified in each input grid (exactly one).
  - object: green_pixel
    value: 3
    property: color used to draw the path in the output grid.
  - object: background_pixel
    value: 0
    property: color white, fills the rest of the grid.
  - object: path
    description: A sequence of connected grid cells connecting the start (blue) and end (red) pixels.
    property: Consists of green pixels (3).
    property: Excludes the start and end pixels themselves.
    property: Generated by a specific deterministic grid-based line drawing algorithm, distinct from standard Bresenham variants tested.
    property: The algorithm appears to generate connected paths where steps can be cardinal (horizontal/vertical) or diagonal, sometimes resulting in adjacent path pixels in the same row or column.

actions:
  - action: locate_endpoints
    actor: agent
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - coordinates of blue_pixel (start_point)
      - coordinates of red_pixel (end_point)
  - action: generate_path_coordinates
    actor: agent
    inputs:
      - start_point (coordinates)
      - end_point (coordinates)
    outputs:
      - set of coordinates (path_pixels) representing the pixels forming the specific grid-based line path required by the task examples.
    notes: The exact algorithm needs to be determined or reverse-engineered from examples. It is not standard Bresenham.
  - action: create_output_grid
    actor: agent
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - path_pixels
      - start_point
      - end_point
    outputs:
      - output_grid
    description: Creates the output grid by copying the input grid, then coloring the pixels at coordinates specified in path_pixels (that are not the start_point or end_point) with green (3).

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The green pixels form a path connecting the cell adjacent to the blue pixel to the cell adjacent to the red pixel along a specific grid trajectory.
  - type: procedural
    description: The path coordinates are determined by applying a specific, yet-to-be-fully-defined, line-drawing algorithm to the start and end point coordinates.
