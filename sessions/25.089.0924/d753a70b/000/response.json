The transformation appears to be a global shift or \"gravity\" effect applied to all pixels that are not the background color. In all examples, the background color is orange (7). All other colored pixels (red, gray, azure, maroon) move down one position vertically. The original positions of the moved pixels are replaced by the background color. Pixels that would move beyond the bottom boundary of the grid are effectively removed.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color (orange, 7).\n    2.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid, examining its color and position (row `r`, column `c`).\n    3.

Check if `target_r` is a valid row index within the grid's height.\n        c.  If `target_r` is valid, set the color of the cell in the output grid at position (`target_r`, `c`) to the color of the input cell `input[r][c]`.\n    4.
