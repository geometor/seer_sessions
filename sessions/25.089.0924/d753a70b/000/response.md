*   **Perception:** The task involves modifying a grid of colored pixels. The transformation appears to be a global shift or "gravity" effect applied to all pixels that are not the background color. In all examples, the background color is orange (7). All other colored pixels (red, gray, azure, maroon) move down one position vertically. The original positions of the moved pixels are replaced by the background color. Pixels that would move beyond the bottom boundary of the grid are effectively removed.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    grid_properties:
      background_color: 7 (orange)
      dimensions: variable (16x16 in examples)
    objects:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          color: integer (0-9)
          position: (row, column)
      - type: foreground_pixel
        description: Any pixel whose color is not the background color (7).
        colors_observed: [2 (red), 5 (gray), 8 (azure), 9 (maroon)]
      - type: background_pixel
        description: Any pixel whose color is the background color (7).
        color: 7 (orange)
    actions:
      - name: shift_down
        target: foreground_pixel
        details: Move the pixel one position down (increase row index by 1).
      - name: replace_with_background
        target: original_position_of_shifted_pixel
        details: Set the color of the pixel's original position to the background color (7).
      - name: remove_pixel
        target: foreground_pixel
        condition: If shifting down moves the pixel beyond the bottom grid boundary.
        details: The pixel does not appear in the output grid.
    relationships:
      - The transformation operates independently on each foreground_pixel based on its position.
      - The output grid retains the dimensions of the input grid.
      - The background color acts as the default state for empty or vacated cells.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color (orange, 7).
    2.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid, examining its color and position (row `r`, column `c`).
    3.  If the color of the input cell `input[r][c]` is *not* the background color (orange, 7):
        a.  Determine the target row index `target_r = r + 1`.
        b.  Check if `target_r` is a valid row index within the grid's height.
        c.  If `target_r` is valid, set the color of the cell in the output grid at position (`target_r`, `c`) to the color of the input cell `input[r][c]`.
    4.  The final output grid contains the background color in all positions except where a non-background pixel was shifted into from the row above.
