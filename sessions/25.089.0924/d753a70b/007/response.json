Identifies the background color (assumed to be the most frequent, typically orange/7).\n    2. Identifies Gray (5) pixels as stationary; they remain in their original position.\n    3. For all other non-background, non-gray pixels (e.g., Red/2, Azure/8, Maroon/9):\n       - Checks if the cell directly below the pixel (r+1, c) exists and contains the background color in the *original input grid*.\n       - If the cell below is background and within bounds, the pixel \"falls\" one step down into that cell in the output grid. The pixel's original location (r, c) in the output grid becomes the background color (implicitly, as the output starts as background).\n       - If the cell below is not background, or if the pixel is at the bottom row, the pixel remains stationary and is placed at its original location (r, c) in the output grid.\n    4. The output grid is built based on these rules applied to the input grid state.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to a NumPy array for efficient processing\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n    \n    # Determine background color (should be 7 based on examples)\n    background_color = find_background_color(input_np) \n    # Define the stationary color (Gray)\n    stationary_color = 5 \n\n    # Initialize the output grid filled entirely with the background color\n    output_np = np.full_like(input_np, background_color)\n\n    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Get the color of the current pixel from the input grid\n            current_color = input_np[r, c]\n\n            # --- Rule Application ---\n\n            # 1. Skip background pixels: If the input pixel is background, \n            #    the corresponding output pixel remains background (as initialized).\n            if current_color == background_color:\n                continue\n\n            # 2. Handle stationary (Gray) pixels: If the pixel is gray, \n            #    place it in the same position in the output grid.\n            if current_color == stationary_color:\n                output_np[r, c] = current_color\n                continue # Process next pixel\n\n            # 3.
