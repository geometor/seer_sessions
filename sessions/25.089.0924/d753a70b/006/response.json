The provided code failed because it did not account for specific conditions observed across all examples. Key observations from the failed tests are:\n    1.  **Stationary Color:** Gray pixels (color 5) do not move; they remain in their original positions.\n    2.  **Conditional Movement:** Other non-background colors (Red=2, Azure=8, Maroon=9) only move down one cell if the cell immediately below them is the background color (Orange=7). They do not move if the cell below is another non-background color, a gray pixel, or if they are already at the bottom edge.\n    3.  **State Dependence:** The decision for a pixel to move depends on the state of the cell below it in the *original* input grid, not the state after other pixels might have moved. This suggests iterating over the input grid and building the output grid based on these fixed conditions.\n\n*   **Strategy:**\n    1.  Refine the logic to identify the background color (consistently 7).\n    2.  Explicitly treat gray (5) as a stationary color.\n    3.  For all other colors (2, 8, 9), check the cell directly below (`r+1, c`) in the *input* grid.\n    4.  If the cell below is background (7) and within bounds, move the pixel to `(r+1, c)` in the *output* grid and set `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to background.\n    5.  If the pixel does not move, copy its color to the same position `(r, c)` in the *output* grid.\n    6.  Gray pixels (5) are always copied directly from their input position `(r, c)` to the output position `(r, c)`.\n    7.  Initialize the output grid with the background color to correctly handle vacated spaces. Iterating from bottom-to-top might simplify handling chains of falling pixels correctly, but iterating top-to-bottom while reading from the original input and writing to a separate output grid should also work. Let's try the latter first as it feels more direct.\n\n*   **Metrics Gathering:**\n    "
