The core logic of the `transform_grid` function, which involves shifting non-background pixels down by one cell, appears consistent with all three training examples provided. The background color is consistently orange (7), and pixels shifting off the bottom edge are correctly removed. The strategy is to correct the function name and ensure the logic correctly handles all cases based on the full set of training examples.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    "
