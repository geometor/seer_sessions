## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core components: marker pairs defining color mappings and objects needing frames. The `find_objects` function correctly uses 4-way connectivity and excludes marker pixels. The primary error lies in the frame drawing logic. The previous code only colored the strict perimeter of the expanded bounding box and only if the target pixel was originally background. The examples show that the frame should fill the *entire area* between the original object's bounding box and the expanded bounding box (1 pixel larger on all sides), but only overwriting background (white) pixels.

## Metrics

Comparing the failed outputs with the expected outputs reveals a consistent pattern:

*   **Frame Shape:** The generated frames are hollow outlines (perimeters), while the expected frames are solid bands filling the space between the object's bounding box and the expanded box.
*   **Pixel Overwriting:** The generated frames only color pixels that were initially background (0). The expected frames also only color pixels that were initially background (0) *within the frame's designated area*. Pixels belonging to the original object are never overwritten by the frame. Pixels belonging to *other* objects or previously drawn frames *within the current frame's area* are also not overwritten if they are non-background.

## Updated Facts

```
yaml
Task: Draw colored frames around specific objects based on color-key markers, filling the area around the object's bounding box.

Input_Grid:
  - Contains a background color (white: 0).
  - Contains distinct Objects:
      - Composed of contiguous pixels (4-way connectivity) of a single non-white color.
      - Vary in shape and position.
      - Excludes Marker pixels.
  - Contains Markers:
      - Located in the bottom-left corner (columns 0 and 1).
      - Consist of vertical pairs of non-white pixels at (row, 0) and (row, 1).
      - Define a mapping: Object_Color (at col 0) -> Frame_Color (at col 1).

Output_Grid:
  - Preserves all elements from the Input_Grid (background, objects, markers).
  - Adds Frames:
      - Associated with identified Objects based on the Marker mapping.
      - Shape: Fills the area defined by expanding the object's bounding box by one pixel in all directions (top, bottom, left, right), *excluding* the area covered by the original bounding box itself.
      - Thickness: One pixel band around the original bounding box.
      - Color: Determined by the Frame_Color associated with the Object_Color in the Markers.
      - Drawing Rule: The Frame_Color is applied *only* to pixels within the defined frame area that are currently background color (white: 0) in the evolving output grid. Original objects and parts of other frames are not overwritten.

Relationships:
  - Each non-marker Object is a target for potential framing.
  - The color of an Object determines its corresponding Frame_Color via the Markers.
  - A Frame's location and shape are defined relative to the bounding box of the Object it encloses.

Actions:
  1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  2. Identify Marker pairs in columns 0 and 1 to create the Object_Color -> Frame_Color mapping. Record the coordinates of marker pixels.
  3. Identify all distinct Objects (contiguous non-white, 4-way connected pixels) excluding marker coordinates.
  4. For each identified Object:
     a. Determine its color (Object_Color).
     b. Check if its Object_Color exists in the Marker mapping.
     c. If yes:
        i. Find the Frame_Color from the mapping.
        ii. Calculate the bounding box of the Object (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
        iii. Define the expanded bounding box coordinates: `frame_min_r = max(0, min_row - 1)`, `frame_max_r = min(height - 1, max_row + 1)`, `frame_min_c = max(0, min_col - 1)`, `frame_max_c = min(width - 1, max_col + 1)`.
        iv. Iterate through all pixels `(r, c)` within the expanded bounding box (from `frame_min_r` to `frame_max_r`, `frame_min_c` to `frame_max_c`).
        v. For each pixel `(r, c)`, check if it falls *outside* the original bounding box (i.e., `r < min_row` or `r > max_row` or `c < min_col` or `c > max_col`).
        vi. If it is outside the original box (i.e., part of the frame area) AND the pixel at `output_grid[r, c]` is currently background (0), set `output_grid[r, c]` to the Frame_Color.
  5. Return the modified output grid.
