            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components: marker pairs defining color mappings and objects needing frames. The `find_objects` function correctly uses 4-way connectivity and excludes marker pixels. The primary error lies in the frame drawing logic. The previous code only colored the strict perimeter of the expanded bounding box and only if the target pixel was originally background. The examples show that the frame should fill the *entire area* between the original object's bounding box and the expanded bounding box (1 pixel larger on all sides), but only overwriting background (white) pixels.\n\n## Metrics\n\nComparing the failed outputs with the expected outputs reveals a consistent pattern:\n\n*   **Frame Shape:** The generated frames are hollow outlines (perimeters), while the expected frames are solid bands filling the space between the object's bounding box and the expanded box.\n*   **Pixel Overwriting:** The generated frames only color pixels that were initially background (0). The expected frames also only color pixels that were initially background (0) *within the frame's designated area*. Pixels belonging to the original object are never overwritten by the frame. Pixels belonging to *other* objects or previously drawn frames *within the current frame's area* are also not overwritten if they are non-background.\n\n## Updated Facts\n\n```"

Original objects and parts of other frames are not overwritten.\n\nRelationships:\n  - Each non-marker Object is a target for potential framing.\n  - The color of an Object determines its corresponding Frame_Color via the Markers.\n  - A Frame's location and shape are defined relative to the bounding box of the Object it encloses.\n\nActions:\n  1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n  2. Identify Marker pairs in columns 0 and 1 to create the Object_Color -> Frame_Color mapping. Record the coordinates of marker pixels.\n  3. Identify all distinct Objects (contiguous non-white, 4-way connected pixels) excluding marker coordinates.\n  4. For each identified Object:\n     a. Determine its color (Object_Color).\n     b. Check if its Object_Color exists in the Marker mapping.\n     c. If yes:\n        i. Find the Frame_Color from the mapping.\n        ii. Calculate the bounding box of the Object (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).\n        iii. Define the expanded bounding box coordinates: `frame_min_r = max(0, min_row - 1)`, `frame_max_r = min(height - 1, max_row + 1)`, `frame_min_c = max(0, min_col - 1)`, `frame_max_c = min(width - 1, max_col + 1)`.\n        iv. Iterate through all pixels `(r, c)` within the expanded bounding box (from `frame_min_r` to `frame_max_r`, `frame_min_c` to `frame_max_c`).\n        v. For each pixel `(r, c)`, check if it falls *outside* the original bounding box (i.e., `r < min_row` or `r > max_row` or `c < min_col` or `c > max_col`).\n        vi. If it is outside the original box (i.e., part of the frame area) AND the pixel at `output_grid[r, c]` is currently background (0), set `output_grid[r, c]` to the Frame_Color.\n  5. Return the modified output grid.\n"
