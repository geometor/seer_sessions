Even-numbered rows (0, 2, 4, ...) are entirely filled with blue (1).\n2. Odd-numbered rows (1, 3, 5, ...) consist of a horizontally repeating sequence of colors.\n\nThe process is:\n1.  Determine the repeating background color sequence (S) and its length (L) for the odd-numbered rows by:\n    a.  Finding the first odd-numbered row in the input grid that does not contain any white (0) pixels.\n    b.  Identifying the pattern in this row by finding the first index 'L' (L > 0) where the color matches the color at index 0. The sequence S is the sub-array from index 0 to L-1.\n2.  Create an output grid by copying the input grid.\n3.  Iterate through each cell (row, col) of the input grid.\n4.  If a cell contains white (0):\n    a.  If the cell is in an even row (row % 2 == 0), replace the white pixel in the output grid with blue (1).\n    b.  If the cell is in an odd row (row % 2 != 0), replace the white pixel in the output grid with the color from the sequence S at index (col % L).\n5.
