"""
The transformation restores a background pattern that has been partially obscured by white (0) pixels.
The background pattern consists of two alternating row types:
1. Even-numbered rows (0, 2, 4, ...) are entirely filled with blue (1).
2. Odd-numbered rows (1, 3, 5, ...) consist of a horizontally repeating sequence of colors, starting with blue (1).

The process is:
1. Identify the repeating color sequence used in the odd-numbered rows by finding an odd row without any white (0) pixels.
2. Create an output grid by copying the input grid.
3. Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
4. If a cell contains white (0), replace it in the output grid with the color that should be there according to the background pattern:
    - If the cell is in an even row, replace white with blue (1).
    - If the cell is in an odd row, replace white with the color from the repeating sequence corresponding to the cell's column index modulo the sequence length.
5. Return the modified output grid.
