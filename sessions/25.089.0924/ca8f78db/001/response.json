Even-numbered rows (0, 2, 4, ...) are entirely filled with blue (1).\n2. Odd-numbered rows (1, 3, 5, ...) consist of a horizontally repeating sequence of colors, starting with blue (1).\n\nThe process is:\n1. Identify the repeating color sequence used in the odd-numbered rows by finding an odd row without any white (0) pixels.\n2. Create an output grid by copying the input grid.\n3. Iterate through each cell of the input grid.\n4. If a cell contains white (0), replace it in the output grid with the color that should be there according to the background pattern:\n    - If the cell is in an even row, replace white with blue (1).\n    - If the cell is in an odd row, replace white with the color from the repeating sequence corresponding to the cell's column index modulo the sequence length.\n5.
