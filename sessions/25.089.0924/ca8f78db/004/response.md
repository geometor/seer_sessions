*   **Assessment and Strategy:**
    *   The previous attempt correctly identified the core task: restoring a background pattern obscured by white pixels. The background consists of solid blue rows alternating with rows containing a repeating color sequence.
    *   The code timed out, strongly suggesting that the method used to identify the repeating sequence (`find_shortest_repeating_sequence`) was computationally too expensive for the 30x30 grid size, possibly due to excessive looping or slicing operations when checking all potential sub-sequence lengths.
    *   The strategy is to simplify the pattern identification. Instead of finding the absolute shortest repeating unit, we can likely determine the necessary sequence by finding the first odd row without white pixels and extracting the pattern from the beginning of that row until the first color repeats. This should be significantly faster. The core replacement logic remains the same.

*   **Metrics:**
