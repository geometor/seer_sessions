Even-numbered rows (0, 2, 4, ...) are entirely filled with blue (1).\n2. Odd-numbered rows (1, 3, 5, ...) consist of a horizontally repeating sequence of colors.\n\nThe process is:\n1.  Determine the repeating background color sequence for the odd-numbered rows by:\n    a.  Finding the first odd-numbered row in the input grid that does not contain any white (0) pixels.\n    b.  Analyzing this row to identify the shortest sequence of colors (S) that repeats horizontally to form the row content, and record its length (L).\n2.  Create an output grid by copying the input grid.\n3.  Iterate through each cell (row, col) of the input grid.\n4.  If a cell contains white (0):\n    a.  If the cell is in an even row (row % 2 == 0), replace the white pixel in the output grid with blue (1).\n    b.  If the cell is in an odd row (row % 2 != 0), replace the white pixel in the output grid with the color from the sequence S at index (col % L).\n5.
