This sequence starts with blue (1) and varies between examples.\n    *   The input grids contain patches of white (0) pixels that overwrite sections of the background pattern. These patches are contiguous areas of white.\n    *   The output grids are identical to the input grids, except that the white (0) patches have been replaced.\n    *   The replacement color for each white pixel corresponds to the color that should exist at that position according to the underlying background pattern.\n    *   The task is to identify the background pattern (specifically the sequence in the odd rows) and use it to \"fill in\" the white areas.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
