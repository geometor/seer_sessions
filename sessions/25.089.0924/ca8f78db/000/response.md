*   **Perception**:
    *   The input and output grids are the same size (30x30) in all examples.
    *   The grids exhibit a clear background pattern consisting of alternating row types.
    *   Even-numbered rows (0, 2, 4, ...) consist entirely of blue (1) pixels.
    *   Odd-numbered rows (1, 3, 5, ...) consist of a horizontally repeating sequence of colors. This sequence starts with blue (1) and varies between examples.
    *   The input grids contain patches of white (0) pixels that overwrite sections of the background pattern. These patches are contiguous areas of white.
    *   The output grids are identical to the input grids, except that the white (0) patches have been replaced.
    *   The replacement color for each white pixel corresponds to the color that should exist at that position according to the underlying background pattern.
    *   The task is to identify the background pattern (specifically the sequence in the odd rows) and use it to "fill in" the white areas.

    grid_properties:

      pattern_color: white (0) - indicates areas to be modified

          - example: train_2
            sequence: [1, 4]         # blue, yellow
            length: 2

    objects:
      - object: white_patch
        description: Contiguous areas of white (0) pixels in the input grid.
        location: Varies per example. Overlays the background pattern.
    
    actions:
      - action: identify_background_pattern
        actor: system
        input: input_grid
        output: definition of even_row content and odd_row repeating sequence
        details: Find an odd row without white pixels to determine the repeating sequence.
      - action: replace_white_pixels
        actor: system
        input: input_grid, background_pattern
        output: output_grid
        details: Iterate through the input grid. If a pixel is white (0), replace it with the color dictated by the background pattern for that specific row and column index. Otherwise, copy the pixel's color.
    
    relationships:
      - The output grid is derived from the input grid.
      - White pixels in the input signal locations where the background pattern needs to be restored.
      - The color used for replacement depends on the pixel's row (even or odd) and its column index relative to the repeating sequence length (for odd rows).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the repeating color sequence used in the odd-numbered rows (rows 1, 3, 5, ...). To do this, find an odd-numbered row in the input grid that does not contain any white (0) pixels. Extract the repeating unit of colors from this row. Let this sequence be `S` and its length be `L`.
    3.  Iterate through each cell `(row, col)` of the input grid.
    4.  If the value of the input cell `input[row, col]` is white (0):
        a.  If the `row` index is even (`row % 2 == 0`), set the corresponding output cell `output[row, col]` to blue (1).
        b.  If the `row` index is odd (`row % 2 != 0`), determine the correct color from the sequence `S` based on the column index. The color is `S[col % L]`. Set the corresponding output cell `output[row, col]` to this color.
    5.  If the value of the input cell `input[row, col]` is not white (0), keep its value in the output grid (it was already copied in step 1).
    6.  Return the modified output grid.
