Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

The transformation identifies enclosed regions bounded by non-white pixels, particularly azure (8) pixels which often form explicit boundaries. 
Within these enclosed regions, it performs a flood fill operation starting from any existing red (2) pixels (seeds). 
The fill color is red (2), and it propagates cardinally (up, down, left, right) only to adjacent white (0) pixels that are reachable from the red seeds without crossing any non-white boundary pixels (including azure 8). 
Pixels outside the boundaries, the boundary pixels themselves (azure 8 and potentially others), and white pixels inside the boundaries but not reachable from a red seed remain unchanged.
