The concept of a flood fill constrained by the azure boundaries was also correct. However, the initial implementation failed because it did not correctly model the *propagation* aspect of the fill. It identified all white pixels inside the boundary (`is_inside`) and then filled them if *any* red pixel was present in the enclosed area, rather than filling only those white pixels *reachable* cardinally from the initial red seed pixels without crossing the azure boundary.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is to implement a more standard flood fill algorithm (like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) that:\n1.  Starts specifically from the coordinates of the initial red (2) pixels.\n2.  Expands iteratively to adjacent white (0) neighbors.\n3.  Colors these neighbors red (2).\n4.  Crucially, treats azure (8) pixels as impenetrable barriers, preventing the fill from crossing them.\n5.  Ensures the fill only operates on pixels that were originally white (0).\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
