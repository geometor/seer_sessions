Pixels outside the azure boundaries and 'inside' white pixels not reachable from a red seed remain unchanged. Azure (8) pixels themselves remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a constrained flood fill with red (2) starting from existing red pixels,\n    limited to white (0) pixels located inside regions bounded by azure (8) pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # 1.
