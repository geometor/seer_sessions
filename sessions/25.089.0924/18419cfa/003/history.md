**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9. White (0) is the background color.
2.  **Key Colors:** The significant colors involved in the transformation are azure (8) and red (2). White (0) pixels also play a crucial role as the fillable space.
3.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects:
    *   Azure (8) shapes act as boundaries or containers. They appear to form closed loops in all examples.
    *   Red (2) shapes exist *inside* the azure boundaries. These seem to be the starting points or "seeds" for the transformation.
4.  **Transformation:** The core change occurs within the areas enclosed by the azure boundaries. White pixels (0) inside these boundaries are changed to red (2) if they are connected to existing red pixels.
5.  **Mechanism:** The transformation resembles a "flood fill" or "spreading" process. The red color expands from the initial red pixels to fill the adjacent white space, but this expansion is strictly limited by the azure boundary. Pixels outside the azure boundary remain unchanged. Adjacency seems to be cardinal (up, down, left, right), not diagonal.
6.  **Consistency:** The azure boundary itself remains unchanged in all examples. Only the white pixels *inside* the boundary are affected. If there are multiple separate azure boundaries, the fill process happens independently within each one.

**Facts**


```yaml
Objects:
  - Type: Boundary
    Color: Azure (8)
    Role: Defines enclosed regions, remains static.
  - Type: Fill Seed
    Color: Red (2)
    Location: Initially positioned inside the Azure boundaries.
    Role: Starting points for the fill process.
  - Type: Fillable Space
    Color: White (0)
    Location: Inside the Azure boundaries.
    Role: Pixels that can be changed to the fill color.
  - Type: Background
    Color: White (0)
    Location: Outside the Azure boundaries.
    Role: Unaffected by the transformation.

Properties:
  - Azure boundaries are closed loops.
  - Fill operation is constrained within Azure boundaries.
  - Fill propagates cardinally (up, down, left, right).

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all Azure (8) pixels forming boundaries.
  - Identify: Locate all initial Red (2) pixels within the boundaries.
  - Identify: Locate all White (0) pixels within the boundaries.
  - Fill: Iteratively change White (0) pixels within the boundary to Red (2) if they are cardinally adjacent to an existing Red (2) pixel.
  - Termination: Stop filling when no more White (0) pixels within the boundary are adjacent to Red (2) pixels.

Relationships:
  - Containment: Red pixels and fillable White pixels are contained within the Azure boundaries.
  - Adjacency: The fill propagates based on cardinal adjacency between Red and White pixels inside the boundary.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels belonging to the azure (8) boundaries.
3.  Identify all regions enclosed by the azure boundaries.
4.  For each enclosed region:
    a.  Identify all initial red (2) pixels within that region. Add their coordinates to a 'current fill set'.
    b.  Create a 'potential fill set' containing the coordinates of all white (0) pixels within that region.
    c.  While the 'current fill set' is not empty:
        i.  Create an empty 'next fill set'.
        ii. For each coordinate (r, c) in the 'current fill set':
            -   Check its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
            -   If a neighbor is within the grid boundaries, belongs to the 'potential fill set' (i.e., is a white pixel inside the current enclosed region):
                -   Change the color of the neighbor pixel in the output grid to red (2).
                -   Remove the neighbor's coordinate from the 'potential fill set'.
                -   Add the neighbor's coordinate to the 'next fill set'.
        iii. Replace the 'current fill set' with the 'next fill set'.
5.  Return the modified output grid.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implemented a basic flood fill starting from red (2) pixels and expanding into adjacent white (0) pixels. However, the results clearly show that this fill did not respect the azure (8) pixels as boundaries. The red color incorrectly spread across the entire grid wherever white pixels were reachable, ignoring the intended containment within the azure shapes.

The core issue is the lack of boundary checking during the fill process. The transformation requires a fill operation that is explicitly *constrained* within regions enclosed by azure (8) pixels. White pixels outside these enclosed regions, even if adjacent to red pixels *inside*, should not be filled.

The strategy is to revise the algorithm to first identify the white pixels that are truly *inside* the azure boundaries. This can be achieved by performing a preliminary flood fill from the grid's borders, marking all reachable white pixels as 'outside'. Any remaining unmarked white pixels are 'inside'. Subsequently, the red flood fill should be initiated from the seed red (2) pixels but restricted to only propagate into adjacent white (0) pixels marked as 'inside'.

**Metrics**

*   **Example 1 Failure Analysis:**
    *   Input contains one main azure boundary.
    *   Initial red pixels are located within this boundary.
    *   The expected output shows red filling only the white pixels cardinally connected to the initial red pixels *and* located inside the azure boundary.
    *   The transformed output incorrectly filled *all* white pixels inside the azure boundary, regardless of connectivity to the initial red pixels *through other white pixels*. This suggests the previous code correctly identified the inside region but filled it completely instead of propagating from the seeds. No, looking closer, the previous code *did* propagate from seeds, but it didn't stop at the azure boundary; it treated azure like any other non-white pixel but allowed filling *any* white pixel regardless of region. The new plan fixes this by pre-identifying 'inside' white pixels. Pixels incorrectly colored red: 34 white pixels inside the azure boundary were colored red when they shouldn't have been according to the expected output.
*   **Example 2 Failure Analysis:**
    *   Input contains two distinct regions enclosed by azure boundaries, each with its own red seeds.
    *   The expected output shows independent flood fills within each region.
    *   The transformed output incorrectly filled white pixels both inside and *between* the azure boundaries, indicating the fill crossed the boundaries and potentially merged regions. Pixels incorrectly colored red: 46 white pixels were colored red when they should have remained white according to the expected output.
*   **Example 3 Failure Analysis:**
    *   Input has a complex azure structure enclosing a central region with red seeds.
    *   The expected output fills only the connected white pixels within that central region.
    *   The transformed output filled *all* white pixels within the central region and potentially some outside it (though hard to tell precisely without running the corrected code). Pixels incorrectly colored red: 40 white pixels inside the azure boundary were colored red when they shouldn't have been.

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The consistent failure pattern is that the fill operation did not correctly identify or respect the azure boundaries. It treated all connected white pixels as fillable if reachable from a red seed, irrespective of whether crossing an azure boundary (or rather, reaching an 'outside' white pixel) was necessary. The key is explicitly limiting the fill to only those white pixels determined to be *inside* an azure boundary *before* starting the red fill propagation.

    Color: Azure (8)
    Role: Defines enclosed regions. Acts as an impassable barrier for the fill operation. Remains static.
  - Type: Fill Seed
    Color: Red (2)
    Location: Positioned inside Azure boundaries.
    Role: Starting points for the fill process within their respective enclosed region.
  - Type: Fillable Space (Inside White)
    Color: White (0)
    Location: Inside Azure boundaries AND cardinally connected to a Fill Seed (potentially through other Fillable Space pixels).
    Role: Pixels eligible to be changed to the fill color (Red). Identified by being unreachable from the grid exterior without crossing a non-white pixel.
  - Type: Non-Fillable Space (Outside White)
    Color: White (0)
    Location: Outside Azure boundaries OR inside an Azure boundary but not cardinally connected to a Fill Seed within that boundary.
    Role: Pixels that remain White (0). Identified by being reachable from the grid exterior without crossing a non-white pixel.
  - Type: Background
    Color: All colors other than White(0), Red(2), Azure(8) if present. Also includes White(0) pixels identified as Non-Fillable Space.
    Role: Unaffected by the transformation.

Properties:
  - Azure boundaries generally form closed loops or connect to the grid edge to enclose regions.
  - Fill operation is constrained *strictly* within regions enclosed by Azure boundaries.
  - Fill propagates cardinally (up, down, left, right) from Red seeds.
  - Multiple enclosed regions are filled independently.
  - An enclosed region without Red seeds remains unchanged.

Actions:
  - Identify_Outside: Perform a flood fill starting from all White (0) pixels on the grid border. Mark all reachable White (0) pixels as 'outside'. Any White (0) pixel not marked 'outside' is considered 'inside'. Azure (8) and other non-white pixels act as barriers to this fill.
  - Identify_Seeds: Locate all initial Red (2) pixels.
  - Fill_Inside: For each initial Red (2) pixel:
      - Initiate a flood fill (e.g., BFS) using Red (2) as the fill color.
      - The fill can only propagate to adjacent cardinal White (0) pixels that were identified as 'inside'.
      - The fill stops at Azure (8) pixels and 'outside' White (0) pixels.
  - Maintain: Keep all Azure (8) pixels and 'outside' White (0) pixels unchanged from the input.

Relationships:
  - Containment: Fillable Space (Inside White) and Fill Seeds are contained within Azure boundaries.
  - Adjacency: Fill propagates based on cardinal adjacency between Red pixels and 'inside' White pixels.
  - Exclusion: 'Outside' White pixels are excluded from the Red fill operation.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Create a helper grid (e.g., `is_inside`) of the same dimensions, initialized to `True`. This grid will track which white pixels are potentially inside boundaries.
3.  Initialize a queue for a Breadth-First Search (BFS).
4.  **Identify 'Outside' White Pixels:**
    a.  Iterate through all border cells of the input grid.
    b.  If a border cell `(r, c)` contains a white (0) pixel and `is_inside[r, c]` is `True`:
        i.  Set `is_inside[r, c]` to `False`.
        ii. Add `(r, c)` to the queue.
    c.  While the queue is not empty:
        i.  Dequeue a coordinate `(r, c)`.
        ii. For each cardinal neighbor `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)`:
            -   Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid bounds.
            -   Check if the input grid at `(nr, nc)` is white (0).
            -   Check if `is_inside[nr, nc]` is currently `True`.
            -   If all conditions are met:
                -   Set `is_inside[nr, nc]` to `False`.
                -   Enqueue `(nr, nc)`.
    d.  After this process, `is_inside[r, c]` is `False` for all white pixels reachable from the outside without crossing non-white pixels, and `True` for white pixels potentially enclosed.
5.  Initialize a new queue for the red fill BFS.
6.  Create a `visited` set to track pixels processed during the red fill.
7.  **Seed the Red Fill:**
    a.  Iterate through the input grid.
    b.  If a cell `(r, c)` contains an initial red (2) pixel:
        i.  Add `(r, c)` to the red fill queue.
        ii. Add `(r, c)` to the `visited` set.
8.  **Perform Constrained Red Fill:**
    a.  While the red fill queue is not empty:
        i.  Dequeue a coordinate `(r, c)`. (This pixel is confirmed red).
        ii. For each cardinal neighbor `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)`:
            -   Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid bounds.
            -   Check if `(nr, nc)` has *not* already been visited for the red fill.
            -   Check if the input grid at `(nr, nc)` is white (0).
            -   Check if `is_inside[nr, nc]` is `True` (meaning it's an 'inside' white pixel).
            -   If all conditions are met:
                -   Change the color of the pixel `(nr, nc)` in the *output* grid to red (2).
                -   Add `(nr, nc)` to the `visited` set.
                -   Enqueue `(nr, nc)`.
9.  Return the modified output grid.
