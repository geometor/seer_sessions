If an enclosed region contains no initial red pixels, it remains unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a flood fill with red (2) starting from existing red pixels,\n    constrained within regions bounded by azure (8) pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Initialize a queue for Breadth-First Search (BFS) flood fill\n    queue = deque()\n    # Use a set to keep track of visited white cells to prevent cycles and redundant processing\n    visited_white = set()\n\n    # Find initial red pixels and add them to the queue\n    # Also, add initial red pixels to visited_white conceptually, \n    # so we don't try to fill them later.
