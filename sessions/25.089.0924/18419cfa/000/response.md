**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9. White (0) is the background color.
2.  **Key Colors:** The significant colors involved in the transformation are azure (8) and red (2). White (0) pixels also play a crucial role as the fillable space.
3.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects:
    *   Azure (8) shapes act as boundaries or containers. They appear to form closed loops in all examples.
    *   Red (2) shapes exist *inside* the azure boundaries. These seem to be the starting points or "seeds" for the transformation.
4.  **Transformation:** The core change occurs within the areas enclosed by the azure boundaries. White pixels (0) inside these boundaries are changed to red (2) if they are connected to existing red pixels.
5.  **Mechanism:** The transformation resembles a "flood fill" or "spreading" process. The red color expands from the initial red pixels to fill the adjacent white space, but this expansion is strictly limited by the azure boundary. Pixels outside the azure boundary remain unchanged. Adjacency seems to be cardinal (up, down, left, right), not diagonal.
6.  **Consistency:** The azure boundary itself remains unchanged in all examples. Only the white pixels *inside* the boundary are affected. If there are multiple separate azure boundaries, the fill process happens independently within each one.

**Facts**


```yaml
Objects:
  - Type: Boundary
    Color: Azure (8)
    Role: Defines enclosed regions, remains static.
  - Type: Fill Seed
    Color: Red (2)
    Location: Initially positioned inside the Azure boundaries.
    Role: Starting points for the fill process.
  - Type: Fillable Space
    Color: White (0)
    Location: Inside the Azure boundaries.
    Role: Pixels that can be changed to the fill color.
  - Type: Background
    Color: White (0)
    Location: Outside the Azure boundaries.
    Role: Unaffected by the transformation.

Properties:
  - Azure boundaries are closed loops.
  - Fill operation is constrained within Azure boundaries.
  - Fill propagates cardinally (up, down, left, right).

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all Azure (8) pixels forming boundaries.
  - Identify: Locate all initial Red (2) pixels within the boundaries.
  - Identify: Locate all White (0) pixels within the boundaries.
  - Fill: Iteratively change White (0) pixels within the boundary to Red (2) if they are cardinally adjacent to an existing Red (2) pixel.
  - Termination: Stop filling when no more White (0) pixels within the boundary are adjacent to Red (2) pixels.

Relationships:
  - Containment: Red pixels and fillable White pixels are contained within the Azure boundaries.
  - Adjacency: The fill propagates based on cardinal adjacency between Red and White pixels inside the boundary.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels belonging to the azure (8) boundaries.
3.  Identify all regions enclosed by the azure boundaries.
4.  For each enclosed region:
    a.  Identify all initial red (2) pixels within that region. Add their coordinates to a 'current fill set'.
    b.  Create a 'potential fill set' containing the coordinates of all white (0) pixels within that region.
    c.  While the 'current fill set' is not empty:
        i.  Create an empty 'next fill set'.
        ii. For each coordinate (r, c) in the 'current fill set':
            -   Check its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
            -   If a neighbor is within the grid boundaries, belongs to the 'potential fill set' (i.e., is a white pixel inside the current enclosed region):
                -   Change the color of the neighbor pixel in the output grid to red (2).
                -   Remove the neighbor's coordinate from the 'potential fill set'.
                -   Add the neighbor's coordinate to the 'next fill set'.
        iii. Replace the 'current fill set' with the 'next fill set'.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
