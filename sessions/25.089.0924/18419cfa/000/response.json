White (0) is the background color.\n2.  **Key Colors:** The significant colors involved in the transformation are azure (8) and red (2). White (0) pixels also play a crucial role as the fillable space.\n3.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects:\n    *   Azure (8) shapes act as boundaries or containers. They appear to form closed loops in all examples.\n    *   Red (2) shapes exist *inside* the azure boundaries. These seem to be the starting points or \"seeds\" for the transformation.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core change occurs within the areas enclosed by the azure boundaries. White pixels (0) inside these boundaries are changed to red (2) if they are connected to existing red pixels.\n5.  **Mechanism:** The transformation resembles a \"flood fill\" or \"spreading\" process. The red color expands from the initial red pixels to fill the adjacent white space, but this expansion is strictly limited by the azure boundary. Pixels outside the azure boundary remain unchanged. Adjacency seems to be cardinal (up, down, left, right), not diagonal.\n6.  **Consistency:** The azure boundary itself remains unchanged in all examples. Only the white pixels *inside* the boundary are affected. If there are multiple separate azure boundaries, the fill process happens independently within each one.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
