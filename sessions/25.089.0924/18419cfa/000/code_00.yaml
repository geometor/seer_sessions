Objects:
  - Type: Boundary
    Color: Azure (8)
    Role: Defines enclosed regions, remains static.
  - Type: Fill Seed
    Color: Red (2)
    Location: Initially positioned inside the Azure boundaries.
    Role: Starting points for the fill process.
  - Type: Fillable Space
    Color: White (0)
    Location: Inside the Azure boundaries.
    Role: Pixels that can be changed to the fill color.
  - Type: Background
    Color: White (0)
    Location: Outside the Azure boundaries.
    Role: Unaffected by the transformation.

Properties:
  - Azure boundaries are closed loops.
  - Fill operation is constrained within Azure boundaries.
  - Fill propagates cardinally (up, down, left, right).

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all Azure (8) pixels forming boundaries.
  - Identify: Locate all initial Red (2) pixels within the boundaries.
  - Identify: Locate all White (0) pixels within the boundaries.
  - Fill: Iteratively change White (0) pixels within the boundary to Red (2) if they are cardinally adjacent to an existing Red (2) pixel.
  - Termination: Stop filling when no more White (0) pixels within the boundary are adjacent to Red (2) pixels.

Relationships:
  - Containment: Red pixels and fillable White pixels are contained within the Azure boundaries.
  - Adjacency: The fill propagates based on cardinal adjacency between Red and White pixels inside the boundary.
