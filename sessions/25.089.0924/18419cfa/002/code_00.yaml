Objects:
  - Type: Boundary
    Color: Azure (8)
    Role: Defines enclosed regions. Acts as an impassable barrier for the fill operation. Remains static.
  - Type: Fill Seed
    Color: Red (2)
    Location: Positioned inside Azure boundaries.
    Role: Starting points for the fill process within their respective enclosed region.
  - Type: Fillable Space (Inside White)
    Color: White (0)
    Location: Inside Azure boundaries AND cardinally connected to a Fill Seed (potentially through other Fillable Space pixels).
    Role: Pixels eligible to be changed to the fill color (Red). Identified by being unreachable from the grid exterior without crossing a non-white pixel.
  - Type: Non-Fillable Space (Outside White)
    Color: White (0)
    Location: Outside Azure boundaries OR inside an Azure boundary but not cardinally connected to a Fill Seed within that boundary.
    Role: Pixels that remain White (0). Identified by being reachable from the grid exterior without crossing a non-white pixel.
  - Type: Background
    Color: All colors other than White(0), Red(2), Azure(8) if present. Also includes White(0) pixels identified as Non-Fillable Space.
    Role: Unaffected by the transformation.

Properties:
  - Azure boundaries generally form closed loops or connect to the grid edge to enclose regions.
  - Fill operation is constrained *strictly* within regions enclosed by Azure boundaries.
  - Fill propagates cardinally (up, down, left, right) from Red seeds.
  - Multiple enclosed regions are filled independently.
  - An enclosed region without Red seeds remains unchanged.

Actions:
  - Identify_Outside: Perform a flood fill starting from all White (0) pixels on the grid border. Mark all reachable White (0) pixels as 'outside'. Any White (0) pixel not marked 'outside' is considered 'inside'. Azure (8) and other non-white pixels act as barriers to this fill.
  - Identify_Seeds: Locate all initial Red (2) pixels.
  - Fill_Inside: For each initial Red (2) pixel:
      - Initiate a flood fill (e.g., BFS) using Red (2) as the fill color.
      - The fill can only propagate to adjacent cardinal White (0) pixels that were identified as 'inside'.
      - The fill stops at Azure (8) pixels and 'outside' White (0) pixels.
  - Maintain: Keep all Azure (8) pixels and 'outside' White (0) pixels unchanged from the input.

Relationships:
  - Containment: Fillable Space (Inside White) and Fill Seeds are contained within Azure boundaries.
  - Adjacency: Fill propagates based on cardinal adjacency between Red pixels and 'inside' White pixels.
  - Exclusion: 'Outside' White pixels are excluded from the Red fill operation.
