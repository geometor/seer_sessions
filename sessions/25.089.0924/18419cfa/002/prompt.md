Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

The transformation identifies enclosed regions bounded by azure (8) pixels. 
Within each enclosed region, it performs a flood fill operation starting from any existing red (2) pixels. 
The fill color is red (2), and it propagates cardinally (up, down, left, right) to adjacent white (0) pixels. 
The fill is constrained by the azure (8) boundaries; it does not cross or change the azure pixels. 
Pixels outside the azure boundaries remain unchanged. If an enclosed region contains no initial red pixels, it remains unchanged.
