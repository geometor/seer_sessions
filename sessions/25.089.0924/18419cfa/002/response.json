            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code implemented a basic flood fill starting from red (2) pixels and expanding into adjacent white (0) pixels. However, the results clearly show that this fill did not respect the azure (8) pixels as boundaries. The red color incorrectly spread across the entire grid wherever white pixels were reachable, ignoring the intended containment within the azure shapes.\n\nThe core issue is the lack of boundary checking during the fill process. The transformation requires a fill operation that is explicitly *constrained* within regions enclosed by azure (8) pixels. White pixels outside these enclosed regions, even if adjacent to red pixels *inside*, should not be filled.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the algorithm to first identify the white pixels that are truly *inside* the azure boundaries. This can be achieved by performing a preliminary flood fill from the grid's borders, marking all reachable white pixels as 'outside'. Any remaining unmarked white pixels are 'inside'. Subsequently, the red flood fill should be initiated from the seed red (2) pixels but restricted to only propagate into adjacent white (0) pixels marked as 'inside'.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n*   **Example 1 Failure Analysis:**\n    *   Input contains one main azure boundary.\n    *   Initial red pixels are located within this boundary.\n    *   The expected output shows red filling only the white pixels cardinally connected to the initial red pixels *and* located inside the azure boundary.\n    *   The transformed output incorrectly filled *all* white pixels inside the azure boundary, regardless of connectivity to the initial red pixels *through other white pixels*. This suggests the previous code correctly identified the inside region but filled it completely instead of propagating from the seeds. No, looking closer, the previous code *did* propagate from seeds, but it didn't stop at the azure boundary; it treated azure like any other non-white pixel but allowed filling *any* white pixel regardless of region. The new plan fixes this by pre-identifying 'inside' white pixels. Pixels incorrectly colored red: 34 white pixels inside the azure boundary were colored red when they shouldn't have been according to the expected output.\n*   **Example 2 Failure Analysis:**\n    *   Input contains two distinct regions enclosed by azure boundaries, each with its own red seeds.\n    *   The expected output shows independent flood fills within each region.\n    *   The transformed output incorrectly filled white pixels both inside and *between* the azure boundaries, indicating the fill crossed the boundaries and potentially merged regions. Pixels incorrectly colored red: 46 white pixels were colored red when they should have remained white according to the expected output.\n*   **Example 3 Failure Analysis:**\n    *   Input has a complex azure structure enclosing a central region with red seeds.\n    *   The expected output fills only the connected white pixels within that central region.\n    *   The transformed output filled *all* white pixels within the central region and potentially some outside it (though hard to tell precisely without running the corrected code). Pixels incorrectly colored red: 40 white pixels inside the azure boundary were colored red when they shouldn't have been.\n\n**Conclusion from Metrics:** The consistent failure pattern is that the fill operation did not correctly identify or respect the azure boundaries. It treated all connected white pixels as fillable if reachable from a red seed, irrespective of whether crossing an azure boundary (or rather, reaching an 'outside' white pixel) was necessary. The key is explicitly limiting the fill to only those white pixels determined to be *inside* an azure boundary *before* starting the red fill propagation.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
