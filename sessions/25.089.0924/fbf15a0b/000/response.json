They primarily consist of an azure (8) background.\n2.  **Pattern Pixels:** Each input grid contains repeating patterns of a specific color (blue (1), orange (7), green (3), or yellow (4)) interspersed with the azure background color, usually along rows.\n3.  **Marker Pixels:** Crucially, every input grid contains exactly two gray (5) pixels. These gray pixels appear to act as markers or signals.\n4.  **Marker Alignment:** The two gray pixels in each input are always aligned either vertically (sharing the same column index) or horizontally (sharing the same row index). Their specific row/column index varies. In the vertical cases observed, they are in either the first or the last column. In the horizontal case observed, they are in the first row.\n5.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is always a subgrid (a crop) of the input grid. It retains the pattern pixels and background from the cropped area but excludes the gray marker pixels.\n6.  **Transformation = Cropping:** The core transformation is a cropping operation applied to the input grid. The size and position of the crop are determined by the location and alignment of the two gray marker pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
