The output grids are nearly identical, but certain azure (8) pixels are changed to yellow (4). The positions of the blue (1) pixels remain unchanged. The transformation seems to identify specific locations based on the relative positions of the blue pixels. Specifically, an azure pixel changes color if it lies at the intersection of a \"corridor\" defined by blue pixels both horizontally and vertically.\n\n*   **Facts YAML:**\n    "
