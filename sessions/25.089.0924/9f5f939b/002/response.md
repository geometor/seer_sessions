Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial hypothesis (an azure pixel turns yellow if there's at least one blue pixel above, below, left, and right) was too broad. It correctly identified the pixel in Example 2 but incorrectly identified additional pixels in Examples 1 and 3. The code based on this hypothesis produced outputs that contained *more* yellow pixels than the expected outputs. This suggests the conditions for changing an azure pixel to yellow are more specific than initially thought. Examining the incorrect pixels and comparing them with the correct ones revealed a pattern related to symmetry or midpoints. The azure pixel that changes to yellow appears to be exactly halfway between the *closest* blue pixels vertically and halfway between the *closest* blue pixels horizontally.
