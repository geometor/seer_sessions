            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The background is white (0).\n2.  **Key Objects:** The primary objects in the input grids are hollow rectangles made of a single color. These rectangles have a frame exactly one pixel thick.\n3.  **Other Elements:** Besides the rectangles, the input grids contain scattered single pixels of various colors, distinct from the rectangle colors and the background.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves modifying the interior of the hollow rectangles and removing the scattered pixels.\n5.  **Filling Pattern:** The interior of the hollow rectangles (originally white) is filled with a specific color using a checkerboard pattern.\n6.  **Color Correspondence:** There's a rule linking the color of each hollow rectangle to the color used to fill its interior. This fill color comes from the set of colors of the scattered pixels found in the input.\n7.  **Scattered Pixel Removal:** All the original scattered single pixels are removed in the output (turned white).\n8.  **Rectangle Preservation:** The frames of the hollow rectangles themselves remain unchanged in the output.\n9.  **Checkerboard Detail:** The checkerboard fill pattern seems to depend on the coordinates. Specifically, comparing the input and output, a pixel at (row `r`, column `c`) inside a rectangle is filled if the parity of `r + c` matches the parity of `r0 + c0`, where `(r0, c0)` are the coordinates of the top-left pixel *inside* the hollow rectangle.\n10. **Color Pairing Rule:** Based on analyzing the three examples, the pairing between a rectangle's color and its fill color follows a specific rule: If you sort the distinct rectangle colors numerically (ascending) and sort the distinct scattered pixel colors numerically (ascending), the smallest rectangle color gets paired with the largest scattered color, and the largest rectangle color gets paired with the smallest scattered color. This pattern holds across the examples where there are two distinct rectangle colors and two distinct scattered colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
