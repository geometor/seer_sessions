            "text": "Okay, let's break down the perception, facts, and the transformation program for this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Background:** The grid primarily consists of a white background (color 0).\n2.  **Objects/Patterns:** There are distinct objects or patterns present in the input grids:\n    *   **Line Patterns:** Symmetrical patterns of the form `X Z X` appear both horizontally (1x3) and vertically (3x1), where `X` is a specific color (e.g., yellow-4, azure-8, blue-1) and `Z` is the central color, which can be white (0) or another color. Examples: `4 8 4`, `4 0 4`, `8 0 8`, `1 / 3 / 1`.\n    *   **Plus Patterns:** A central color `Z` surrounded orthogonally by color `X`. Example: `8 6 8` plus-shape.\n    *   **H-Patterns:** A central color `Z` surrounded diagonally and orthogonally by color `X` in an H-shape. Example: `1 0 1 / 0 3 0 / 1 0 1`.\n    *   **Markers:** Isolated single pixels of a non-white color (e.g., azure-8, magenta-6, green-3, red-2) that are surrounded only by white pixels or grid boundaries. These markers seem to act as triggers or sources of color information.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves interaction between the isolated \"marker\" pixels and the structured \"patterns\". It appears that:\n    *   A marker pixel's color is used to fill or define the central color of a pattern.\n    *   The pattern (potentially modified with the marker's color) is then copied or stamped onto the grid, centered at the original location of the marker pixel.\n    *   The original pattern might also be updated if its central color was initially white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.\n2.  **Identify Source Patterns:** Scan the input grid to find all instances of predefined symmetrical patterns (like `X Z X` lines, `X Z X` plus-shapes, `X Z X` H-shapes). For each pattern found, record its type, shape, frame color `X`, center color `Z`, and the coordinates of its center pixel.\n3.  **Identify Target Markers:** Scan the input grid to find all isolated single pixels of a non-white color `Y`. A pixel is isolated if all its orthogonal and diagonal neighbors are white (0) or off the grid boundary. Record the color `Y` and coordinates for each marker found. Ensure markers are not part of the identified source patterns.\n4.  **Process Each Marker:** Iterate through each identified target marker `Y` located at `loc_Y`.\n    a.  **Find Closest Pattern:** Calculate the Euclidean distance from `loc_Y` to the center coordinates of every identified source pattern `P`. Select the source pattern `P` (with frame color `X`, center color `Z`, located at `loc_P`) that has the minimum distance to `loc_Y`.\n    b.  **Create Modified Pattern:** Construct a new pattern instance, `P'`, which has the same shape and frame color `X` as the selected source pattern `P`, but its center color is set to the marker's color `Y`.\n    c.  **Stamp Modified Pattern:** Overwrite the pixels in the *output grid* corresponding to the area of `P'`, centered at the marker's original location `loc_Y`.\n    d.  **Conditionally Update Original Pattern:** Examine the original center color `Z` of the selected source pattern `P`. If `Z` was white (0), update the center pixel of that pattern at its original location `loc_P` in the *output grid* to the marker color `Y`. If `Z` was not white (0), the original pattern at `loc_P` in the output grid remains unchanged from the initial copy.\n5.  **Finalization:** After processing all markers, the modified output grid represents the final result."
