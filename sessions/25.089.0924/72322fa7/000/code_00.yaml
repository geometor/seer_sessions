task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: 0 (white)
    - elements: patterns, markers

identified_objects:
  - object_type: pattern
    description: Symmetrical structures with a frame color (X) and a center color (Z).
    subtypes:
      - line: 1x3 horizontal or 3x1 vertical (X Z X)
      - plus: Center Z, orthogonal frame X
      - H-shape: Center Z, specific corner/side frame X
    properties:
      - frame_color: X (non-white)
      - center_color: Z (can be white or non-white)
      - location: center coordinates
      - orientation: horizontal, vertical, N/A
      - shape: line, plus, H
  - object_type: marker
    description: Isolated single non-white pixel Y surrounded by white.
    properties:
      - color: Y (non-white)
      - location: coordinates
      - isolated: true (surrounded by white/boundary)

relationships:
  - type: proximity
    description: Spatial closeness between a marker and a pattern. Measured by distance between marker coordinates and pattern center.
  - type: color_transfer
    description: The color (Y) of a marker determines the new center color of a target pattern.
  - type: template_copy
    description: A pattern structure (potentially modified) is copied to the location of a marker.
  - type: conditional_update
    description: An original pattern is updated only if its initial center color was white (0).

actions:
  - action: find_patterns
    description: Identify all instances of defined pattern types in the input grid.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list of pattern objects (type, frame_color, center_color, location, shape)
  - action: find_markers
    description: Identify all isolated single non-white pixels in the input grid.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list of marker objects (color, location)
  - action: associate_marker_pattern
    description: For each marker, find the closest pattern based on distance.
    inputs: marker, list of patterns
    outputs: associated pattern
  - action: modify_pattern
    description: Create a new pattern instance using the source pattern's frame and shape, but the marker's color as the center.
    inputs: source_pattern, marker_color
    outputs: modified_pattern
  - action: stamp_pattern
    description: Copy the pixels of a pattern onto the grid, centered at a specific location.
    inputs: pattern_to_stamp, target_location, target_grid
    outputs: updated_target_grid
  - action: update_original_pattern
    description: If the source pattern's original center color was white, update its representation in the target grid with the marker's color.
    inputs: source_pattern, marker_color, target_grid
    outputs: updated_target_grid

transformation_goal:
  description: >
    Use isolated marker pixels (Y) to define the center color of the closest source pattern (X Z X structure).
    Copy this potentially modified pattern (X Y X structure) to the marker's location.
    Update the original source pattern's center to Y only if it was originally white (0).
