Transformation Rule:

1.  Identify Symmetrical Patterns: Find all instances of predefined symmetrical patterns in the input grid. These patterns have a 'frame' color (X) and a 'center' color (Z). Recognized patterns include:
    - Horizontal Line: 1x3 shape `X Z X`
    - Vertical Line: 3x1 shape `X Z X` (stacked vertically)
    - Plus Shape: Center Z surrounded orthogonally by X
    - H-Shape: Center Z surrounded diagonally by X (like corners of a 3x3 excluding sides)
    Record the pattern type, frame color, center color, center coordinates, and relative pixel offsets for each found pattern. Keep track of coordinates occupied by these patterns.

2.  Identify Markers: Find all isolated single non-white pixels (Y) in the input grid. A pixel is isolated if all its 8 neighbors are white (0) or off-grid, and it does not belong to any identified pattern's structure. Record the marker's color (Y) and coordinates.

3.  Process Markers: For each identified marker:
    a.  Find Closest Pattern: Determine the pattern whose center is closest (using Euclidean distance) to the marker's location.
    b.  Stamp Modified Pattern: Create a temporary pattern structure identical to the closest pattern found, but replace its center color Z with the marker's color Y. 'Stamp' this new `X Y X` pattern onto the output grid, centered at the marker's original location.
    c.  Conditionally Update Original Pattern: If the original center color (Z) of the closest pattern was white (0), update the pixel at the original pattern's center coordinates in the output grid to the marker's color (Y). Otherwise, leave the original pattern's location unchanged.

4.  Output: The final modified grid is the result.
