"""
Identifies rectangular objects in the input grid, each containing exactly one 'seed' pixel of a different color.
For each object, it modifies the interior pixels (excluding the border) based on their Manhattan distance from the seed pixel.
Pixels at odd distances from the seed take the seed's color.
Pixels at even, non-zero distances from the seed turn white (0).
The border pixels of the rectangle and the background remain unchanged.
