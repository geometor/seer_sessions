Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The input grids typically contain one or more large, solid-colored rectangular objects set against a white (0) background. Crucially, each of these main rectangular objects contains exactly one pixel of a different color somewhere within its boundaries. This single different-colored pixel acts as a "seed" or "source" for the transformation.

The transformation modifies the *interior* of these rectangular objects, leaving the white background and the border pixels of the rectangles unchanged. The modification involves creating a pattern radiating outwards from the location of the "seed" pixel. The pattern uses the color of the seed pixel and the white color (0). Specifically, pixels within the rectangle's interior (excluding the border) change color based on their Manhattan distance from the seed pixel: pixels at odd distances take the seed pixel's color, while pixels at even, non-zero distances turn white (0). The original seed pixel retains its color (distance 0). This process happens independently for each rectangular object present in the input.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Modify the interior of rectangular objects based on a single 'seed' pixel within each.
items:
  - item_type: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The default background color of the grid. Remains unchanged.
  - item_type: object
    shape: rectangle
    description: Solid-colored rectangles are the primary elements. Multiple can exist.
    properties:
      - border_color: The main color of the rectangle.
      - border_pixels: Pixels forming the outer edge of the rectangle. Remain unchanged.
      - interior_pixels: Pixels inside the border. These are subject to transformation.
  - item_type: seed_pixel
    description: A single pixel within each rectangle that has a different color than the rectangle's border_color.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the seed pixel (seed_color). Used in the output pattern.
      - location: The (row, column) coordinates of the seed pixel. Acts as the center for the pattern.
relationship:
  - type: containment
    item1: seed_pixel
    item2: object
    description: Each rectangular object contains exactly one seed_pixel.
action:
  - name: pattern_generation
    input: object, seed_pixel
    output: modified interior_pixels
    description: |
      For each pixel within the object's interior (excluding the border):
      1. Calculate the Manhattan distance (d) from the pixel to the seed_pixel's location.
      2. If d is 0 (the seed pixel itself), the color remains the seed_color.
      3. If d is odd, the pixel's color becomes the seed_color.
      4. If d is even and non-zero, the pixel's color becomes white (0).
invariants:
  - Grid dimensions remain the same.
  - Background pixels (white) remain unchanged.
  - Border pixels of the rectangular objects remain unchanged.
  - The location and color of the seed pixel itself define the center and color of the odd-distance pattern elements.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct rectangular objects in the input grid. A rectangular object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color (color C1), surrounded by the background color (white, 0) or the grid boundaries.
3.  For each identified rectangular object:
    a.  Find the single pixel *inside* this object that has a different color (color C2) than the object's main color (C1). This is the "seed pixel". Record its color (C2) and its location (seed\_row, seed\_col).
    b.  Identify all pixels that belong to this object but are *not* part of its outer border (these are the "interior pixels").
    c.  For each interior pixel at location (row, col):
        i.  Calculate the Manhattan distance: `distance = abs(row - seed_row) + abs(col - seed_col)`.
        ii. If `distance` is 0, do nothing (the pixel keeps its original seed color C2).
        iii.If `distance` is odd, change the color of the pixel at (row, col) in the *output grid* to the seed color (C2).
        iv. If `distance` is even and greater than 0, change the color of the pixel at (row, col) in the *output grid* to white (0).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
