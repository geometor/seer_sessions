            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\nThe input grids typically contain one or more large, solid-colored rectangular objects set against a white (0) background. Crucially, each of these main rectangular objects contains exactly one pixel of a different color somewhere within its boundaries. This single different-colored pixel acts as a \"seed\" or \"source\" for the transformation.\n\nThe transformation modifies the *interior* of these rectangular objects, leaving the white background and the border pixels of the rectangles unchanged. The modification involves creating a pattern radiating outwards from the location of the \"seed\" pixel. The pattern uses the color of the seed pixel and the white color (0). Specifically, pixels within the rectangle's interior (excluding the border) change color based on their Manhattan distance from the seed pixel: pixels at odd distances take the seed pixel's color, while pixels at even, non-zero distances turn white (0). The original seed pixel retains its color (distance 0). This process happens independently for each rectangular object present in the input.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
