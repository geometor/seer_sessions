task_description: Modify the interior of rectangular objects based on a single 'seed' pixel within each.
items:
  - item_type: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The default background color of the grid. Remains unchanged.
  - item_type: object
    shape: rectangle
    description: Solid-colored rectangles are the primary elements. Multiple can exist.
    properties:
      - border_color: The main color of the rectangle.
      - border_pixels: Pixels forming the outer edge of the rectangle. Remain unchanged.
      - interior_pixels: Pixels inside the border. These are subject to transformation.
  - item_type: seed_pixel
    description: A single pixel within each rectangle that has a different color than the rectangle's border_color.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the seed pixel (seed_color). Used in the output pattern.
      - location: The (row, column) coordinates of the seed pixel. Acts as the center for the pattern.
relationship:
  - type: containment
    item1: seed_pixel
    item2: object
    description: Each rectangular object contains exactly one seed_pixel.
action:
  - name: pattern_generation
    input: object, seed_pixel
    output: modified interior_pixels
    description: |
      For each pixel within the object's interior (excluding the border):
      1. Calculate the Manhattan distance (d) from the pixel to the seed_pixel's location.
      2. If d is 0 (the seed pixel itself), the color remains the seed_color.
      3. If d is odd, the pixel's color becomes the seed_color.
      4. If d is even and non-zero, the pixel's color becomes white (0).
invariants:
  - Grid dimensions remain the same.
  - Background pixels (white) remain unchanged.
  - Border pixels of the rectangular objects remain unchanged.
  - The location and color of the seed pixel itself define the center and color of the odd-distance pattern elements.
