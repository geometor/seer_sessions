They appear to be composed of smaller 4x4 blocks, separated by lines of red pixels (color 2).\n2.  **Repeating Units:** Within the red grid lines, there's a repeating 3x3 pattern. The most common pattern uses yellow (4) and blue (1):\n    "

The red grid lines remain unchanged.\n5.  **Propagation:** The change seems to propagate outwards from the initial green/blue \"trigger\" blocks. If a yellow/blue \"target\" block is next to (up, down, left, or right) a green/blue \"trigger\" block, the target block becomes a trigger block in the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Extract all unique 3x3 patterns found within the top-left 3x3 area of each 4x4 block defined by the separator grid.\n3.  Determine the \"target\" pattern (the most frequent one, e.g., yellow/blue) and the \"trigger\" pattern (the less frequent one, e.g., green/blue).\n4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n5.  Iterate through each 4x4 block location in the grid (based on the separator lines). Let the top-left corner of the 3x3 pattern within a block be `(r, c)`.\n6.  For each block at `(r, c)` in the *input* grid, check if its 3x3 pattern matches the \"target\" pattern.\n7.  If it is the \"target\" pattern, examine its immediate neighbors in the *input* grid: the blocks containing patterns starting at `(r-4, c)`, `(r+4, c)`, `(r, c-4)`, and `(r, c+4)`.\n8.  If any of these neighboring blocks in the *input* grid contain the \"trigger\" pattern, then update the 3x3 area starting at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid, replacing the \"target\" pattern with the \"trigger\" pattern.\n9.  After checking all block locations, the final *output* grid contains the result of the transformation."
