```python
import numpy as np

"""
Identify the dividing lines (horizontal at rows 5, 11; vertical at columns 5, 11) and their color ('FrameColor').
Define four quadrant areas based on these lines:
- Top-Left (TL): rows 0-4, cols 0-4
- Top-Right (TR): rows 0-4, cols 6-10
- Bottom-Left (BL): rows 6-10, cols 0-4
- Bottom-Right (BR): rows 6-10, cols 6-10
Iterate through the grid. If a pixel is background color (0) AND it is located within the TR, BL, or BR quadrant areas, change its color in the output grid to the 'FrameColor'. 
Leave all other pixels (dividing lines, objects, background pixels in the TL area, background pixels outside all four areas) unchanged.
