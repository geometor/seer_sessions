GridProperties:
  Size: 17x17 (consistent across examples)
  BackgroundColor: 0 (white)
StructuralElements:
  DividingLines:
    Description: Single-pixel-wide horizontal and vertical lines separating the grid visually into multiple regions.
    Location: Row 5, Row 11, Column 5, Column 11 (0-based index).
    Color: Consistent within an example pair, varies between examples (red=2, azure=8, blue=1). This is the 'FrameColor'.
    Persistence: Unchanged between input and output.
  Regions:
    Description: Nine rectangular regions defined by the dividing lines. A specific region, the Top-Left (TL) region, is treated differently.
    TL_Region:
      Coordinates: Rows 0-4, Columns 0-4.
      Behavior: Pixels within this region are unchanged by the transformation.
    Other_Regions:
      Coordinates: All areas *not* part of the dividing lines and *not* within the TL_Region coordinates.
      Behavior: BackgroundColor pixels within these regions are changed to the FrameColor.
Objects:
  Color: Consistent within an example pair, distinct from BackgroundColor and FrameColor (blue=1, red=2, green=3). This is the 'ObjectColor'.
  Location: Within the regions defined by the dividing lines.
  Persistence: Unchanged between input and output.
Transformation:
  Action: Conditionally fill background pixels based on location.
  TargetPixels: Pixels with BackgroundColor (0).
  Condition: The target pixel must NOT be located within the Top-Left region (rows 0-4, cols 0-4) AND must NOT be part of the dividing lines (row 5, row 11, col 5, col 11).
  FillColor: The FrameColor identified from the dividing lines.
  InvariantPixels: Dividing lines, Objects, and BackgroundColor pixels within the Top-Left region.
Metrics (from code analysis):
  Example 1: FrameColor=2, ObjectColor=1, Background Pixels Changed=63, TL Background Unchanged=16
  Example 2: FrameColor=8, ObjectColor=2, Background Pixels Changed=28, TL Background Unchanged=20
  Example 3: FrameColor=1, ObjectColor=3, Background Pixels Changed=26, TL Background Unchanged=21
