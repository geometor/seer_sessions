However, the transformation logic was overly broad. The execution results clearly show that the initial code modified background pixels (0) in *all* regions outside the top-left inner square (Rows 0-4, Cols 0-4), including the outer bands beyond the second dividing lines (Rows/Cols 12-16).\n\nThe expected outputs reveal a more constrained transformation: only the background pixels (0) located *strictly within* the three inner regions defined by the dividing lines (excluding the top-left one) are changed to the 'FrameColor'. These regions are:\n*   Top-Right Inner (TR):"
