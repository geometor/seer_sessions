*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output grids are always the same size (17x17 in these examples).
    *   Each grid is divided into four main quadrants by single-pixel-wide horizontal and vertical lines.
    *   These dividing lines always consist of a single, consistent color (red=2, azure=8, blue=1 in the examples), which differs between examples but remains the same between the input and output of a single example. Let's call this the "frame color".
    *   The background is consistently white (0).
    *   Within the quadrants, there are distinct objects made of another single color (blue=1, red=2, green=3 in the examples). This "object color" is different from both the background and the frame color.
    *   The transformation primarily affects the white (0) background pixels *within* the quadrants.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    GridProperties:
      Size: 17x17 (consistent across examples)
      BackgroundColor: 0 (white)
    StructuralElements:
      DividingLines:
        Description: Single-pixel-wide horizontal and vertical lines separating the grid into four quadrants.
        Location: Row 5, Row 11, Column 5, Column 11 (0-based index).
        Color: Consistent within an example pair, but varies between examples (e.g., red=2, azure=8, blue=1). This is the 'FrameColor'.
        Persistence: Unchanged between input and output.
      Quadrants:
        Description: Four rectangular regions defined by the dividing lines.
        ContentInput: BackgroundColor (0) and Objects of ObjectColor.
        ContentOutput: FrameColor fills the areas previously occupied by BackgroundColor; Objects remain unchanged.
    Objects:
      Color: Consistent within an example pair, distinct from BackgroundColor and FrameColor (e.g., blue=1, red=2, green=3). This is the 'ObjectColor'.
      Location: Exclusively within the quadrants.
      Persistence: Unchanged between input and output.
    Transformation:
      Action: Fill background pixels within quadrants.
      TargetPixels: Pixels with BackgroundColor (0) located within the quadrants.
      FillColor: The FrameColor identified from the dividing lines.
      InvariantPixels: Dividing lines and Objects.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the color of the horizontal and vertical dividing lines ('FrameColor'). These lines are located at fixed indices (row 5, row 11, column 5, column 11).
    2.  Identify the color of the distinct objects located within the four quadrants ('ObjectColor').
    3.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
    4.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid.
    5.  If the current cell's color is the background color (0/white) AND it is not part of the dividing lines (i.e., its row index is not 5 or 11, and its column index is not 5 or 11), change the corresponding cell in the output grid to the 'FrameColor'.
    6.  If the current cell's color is the 'FrameColor' (part of the dividing lines) or the 'ObjectColor', keep its color unchanged in the output grid.
    7.  The final output grid reflects the original dividing lines and objects, with the background areas within the quadrants filled with the 'FrameColor'.

Iterates through the grid. If a pixel is background color (0), is NOT part of a dividing line, AND is located outside the TL region, its color is changed to the 'FrameColor' in the output grid.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous analysis correctly identified the key structural elements: the grid division by lines ('FrameColor') into nine regions and the presence of 'Objects' within these regions. However, the transformation logic was overly broad. The execution results clearly show that the initial code modified background pixels (0) in *all* regions outside the top-left inner square (Rows 0-4, Cols 0-4), including the outer bands beyond the second dividing lines (Rows/Cols 12-16).

The expected outputs reveal a more constrained transformation: only the background pixels (0) located *strictly within* the three inner regions defined by the dividing lines (excluding the top-left one) are changed to the 'FrameColor'. These regions are:
*   Top-Right Inner (TR):
