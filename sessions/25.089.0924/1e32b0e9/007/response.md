"""
The transformation operates on a grid divided into nine regions by two horizontal and two vertical lines. 
The color of these dividing lines ('FrameColor') is determined.
The goal is to fill background pixels (color 0) with the 'FrameColor', but only within specific regions. 
Specifically, background pixels are filled if they are located within the Top-Right, Bottom-Left, or Bottom-Right inner regions defined by the dividing lines. 
The Top-Left inner region, the dividing lines themselves, any non-background objects within the regions, and the outer bands of the grid remain unchanged.
The dividing lines are assumed to be at fixed indices (rows 5, 11 and columns 5, 11 for a 17x17 grid).
