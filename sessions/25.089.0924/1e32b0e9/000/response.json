Let's call this the \"frame color\".\n    *   The background is consistently white (0).\n    *   Within the quadrants, there are distinct objects made of another single color (blue=1, red=2, green=3 in the examples). This \"object color\" is different from both the background and the frame color.\n    *   The transformation primarily affects the white (0) background pixels *within* the quadrants.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
