Oops, error in Train 2 analysis. Let's fix the find_shapes logic or input parsing. The number of shapes found (3) doesn't match the expected number (4).

Let's re-examine Train 2 input.
Rows 14-18 contain two separate shapes:
H-like: (14,7),(14,8), (15,7), (16,7),(16,8), (17,7),(17,8) -> size 7? No, grid[15,7] is 4. (14,7),(14,8), (15,8), (16,7),(16,8), (17,7),(17,8) -> size 7.
C-like: (15,3),(15,4),(15,5), (16,3), (17,3), (18,3),(18,4),(18,5) -> size 8.

Let's re-run the shape finder carefully for Train 2.
