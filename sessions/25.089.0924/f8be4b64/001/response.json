Original non-white pixels are preserved.\nIf multiple fill operations target the same background pixel, a priority is applied:\n1. Column fill (Magenta)\n2. Row/Column fill (Red, Gray)\n3. Row fill (Yellow, Azure)\nThe fill operation with the highest priority determines the final color of the background pixel.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_plus_centers(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all pixels that are centers of a green plus shape.\n    A center is a pixel (r, c) where grid[r-1, c], grid[r+1, c], \n    grid[r, c-1], and grid[r, c+1] are all green (3).\n    \n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): Input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of tuples, where each tuple is ((row, col), core_color).\n    \"\"\"\n    centers = []\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    # Iterate through possible center locations (avoiding edges)\n    for r in range(1, height - 1):\n        for c in range(1, width - 1):\n            # Check orthogonal neighbors\n            if (grid[r - 1, c] == 3 and\n                grid[r + 1, c] == 3 and\n                grid[r, c - 1] == 3 and\n                grid[r, c + 1] == 3):\n                core_color = grid[r, c]\n                centers.append(((r, c), core_color))\n    return centers\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on green plus shapes and their core colors.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    height, width = grid_np.shape\n\n    # Find all green plus centers and their core colors\n    plus_centers = find_plus_centers(grid_np)\n\n    # Separate centers by the type of fill operation they trigger\n    row_col_fills = [] # Priority 2 (colors 2, 5)\n    col_fills = []     # Priority 1 (color 6)\n    row_fills = []     # Priority 3 (colors 4, 8)\n\n    for (r, c), core_color in plus_centers:\n        if core_color in [2, 5]:\n            row_col_fills.append(((r, c), core_color))\n        elif core_color == 6:\n            col_fills.append(((r, c), core_color))\n        elif core_color in [4, 8]:\n            row_fills.append(((r, c), core_color))\n        # Other core colors (like 0) do nothing\n\n    # Iterate through each pixel to determine its final color\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Only modify original background pixels\n            if grid_np[r, c] == 0:\n                # Check for fills based on priority\n                \n                # Priority 1: Column fills (Magenta)\n                col_fill_color = 0\n                for (pr, pc), p_color in col_fills:\n                    if pc == c:\n                        col_fill_color = p_color # Should always be 6\n                        break # Found highest priority fill for this pixel\n                \n                if col_fill_color != 0:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = col_fill_color\n                    continue # Apply highest priority and move to next pixel\n\n                # Priority 2: Row/Column fills (Red, Gray)\n                row_col_fill_color = 0\n                # Check potential fills, last one found wins if multiple apply\n                for (pr, pc), p_color in row_col_fills:\n                    if pr == r or pc == c:\n                        row_col_fill_color = p_color \n                \n                if row_col_fill_color != 0:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = row_col_fill_color\n                    continue # Apply this priority and move to next pixel\n                    \n                # Priority 3: Row fills (Yellow, Azure)\n                row_fill_color = 0\n                # Check potential fills, last one found wins if multiple apply\n                for (pr, pc), p_color in row_fills:\n                    if pr == r:\n                        row_fill_color = p_color\n                        \n                if row_fill_color != 0:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = row_fill_color\n                    # No continue needed, this is the last check\n\n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n\n```"
