Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain a white background (0) and scattered objects. The primary objects of interest appear to be "plus" shapes made of green pixels (3).
2.  **Green Plus Shapes:** These shapes consist of a central pixel surrounded orthogonally by four green pixels. The central pixel itself can be various colors (white, gray, magenta, yellow, red, azure) or sometimes green itself if it's part of a larger green object (though the defining feature seems to be the 4 orthogonal green neighbours relative to *some* center). Let's refine: the core element is a 3x3 area where the center pixel has 4 green neighbors (N, S, E, W). The color of this central pixel (the "core color") is crucial.
3.  **Core Colors and Actions:** The core color determines an action that modifies the grid:
    *   White (0) core: No action.
    *   Gray (5) or Red (2) core: Fill the row and column intersecting at the core pixel with the core color.
    *   Magenta (6) core: Fill the column intersecting at the core pixel with the core color.
    *   Yellow (4) or Azure (8) core: Fill the row intersecting at the core pixel with the core color.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying these green plus structures, determining their core color, and applying the corresponding row/column fill operation.
5.  **Overlaps and Preservation:** The fill operations only change white (0) background pixels. Original non-white pixels from the input grid are preserved. When multiple fill operations affect the same white pixel, a specific priority seems to apply based on the examples: Column fills (magenta) override Row fills (yellow/azure), which override Row/Column fills (gray/red).
