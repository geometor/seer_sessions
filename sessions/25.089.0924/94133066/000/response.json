            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid is relatively large and predominantly composed of the background color, white (0). Within this background, there is one large, roughly rectangular object primarily composed of blue (1) pixels. This main blue object contains various other colored pixels (red, yellow, green, gray, azure) embedded within it. Additionally, there are several isolated single pixels of various non-white colors scattered across the background, far from the main blue object.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid. It corresponds exactly to the main blue object found in the input, including the other colored pixels contained within its boundary.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve identifying the largest contiguous non-background object in the input grid (which is the blue structure in all examples). Once identified, the bounding box containing this largest object is determined. The portion of the input grid within this bounding box is then extracted to form the output grid. The isolated pixels outside this main object are ignored and do not appear in the output.\n4.  **Key Feature:** The defining characteristic seems to be the size (pixel count) of the connected non-white objects. The transformation focuses solely on the largest one.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
