task_elements:
  - item: Input Grid
    properties:
      - Contains a background color (white).
      - Contains multiple distinct non-white objects (contiguous areas of the same color).
      - One non-white object is significantly larger than the others (the blue structure).
      - Contains isolated single non-white pixels separate from the main object.
  - item: Output Grid
    properties:
      - Is a subgrid of the input grid.
      - Corresponds to the bounding box of the largest non-white object found in the input.
      - Preserves the colors and relative positions of pixels within that bounding box.
actions:
  - Find all contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - Identify the object with the largest number of pixels.
  - Determine the minimum bounding box (top-left and bottom-right coordinates) that encloses this largest object.
  - Extract the subgrid defined by this bounding box from the input grid.
relationships:
  - The output grid's content is directly extracted from the input grid.
  - The size and location of the output grid are determined by the largest connected non-white object in the input grid.
  - Isolated or smaller non-white objects in the input are excluded from the output.
