Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid is relatively large and predominantly composed of the background color, white (0). Within this background, there is one large, roughly rectangular object primarily composed of blue (1) pixels. This main blue object contains various other colored pixels (red, yellow, green, gray, azure) embedded within it. Additionally, there are several isolated single pixels of various non-white colors scattered across the background, far from the main blue object.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid. It corresponds exactly to the main blue object found in the input, including the other colored pixels contained within its boundary.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve identifying the largest contiguous non-background object in the input grid (which is the blue structure in all examples). Once identified, the bounding box containing this largest object is determined. The portion of the input grid within this bounding box is then extracted to form the output grid. The isolated pixels outside this main object are ignored and do not appear in the output.
4.  **Key Feature:** The defining characteristic seems to be the size (pixel count) of the connected non-white objects. The transformation focuses solely on the largest one.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: Input Grid
    properties:
      - Contains a background color (white).
      - Contains multiple distinct non-white objects (contiguous areas of the same color).
      - One non-white object is significantly larger than the others (the blue structure).
      - Contains isolated single non-white pixels separate from the main object.
  - item: Output Grid
    properties:
      - Is a subgrid of the input grid.
      - Corresponds to the bounding box of the largest non-white object found in the input.
      - Preserves the colors and relative positions of pixels within that bounding box.
actions:
  - Find all contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - Identify the object with the largest number of pixels.
  - Determine the minimum bounding box (top-left and bottom-right coordinates) that encloses this largest object.
  - Extract the subgrid defined by this bounding box from the input grid.
relationships:
  - The output grid's content is directly extracted from the input grid.
  - The size and location of the output grid are determined by the largest connected non-white object in the input grid.
  - Isolated or smaller non-white objects in the input are excluded from the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct contiguous areas (objects) composed of non-white pixels (colors 1 through 9).
2.  For each identified object, count the number of pixels it contains.
3.  Select the object that has the maximum pixel count.
4.  Calculate the bounding box coordinates (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column) that tightly enclose the selected largest object.
5.  Create a new grid by extracting all pixels from the input grid that fall within this calculated bounding box. This extracted subgrid is the final output.
