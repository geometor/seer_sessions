**Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis correctly identified the core mechanism: finding a 3x3 yellow-bordered square, extracting its center color, and using that color to fill the output grid. However, the hypothesis incorrectly assumed that *only* the 8 yellow pixels forming the border of that specific square were preserved. The results clearly show that *all* pixels that were yellow (4) in the input grid are preserved in their original locations in the output grid, overlaid onto the new background color. The gray shapes and their associated colored pixels remain irrelevant to the output.

The strategy is to modify the transformation rule to preserve the locations of *all* yellow pixels from the input, not just the ones forming the 3x3 square's border.
