            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed that *all* yellow pixels from the input grid should be preserved in the output. The results clearly show this is not the case; the yellow pixels in the output follow a different pattern.\n\nSpecifically:\n1.  The background color *is* correctly determined by the center pixel of the unique 3x3 yellow-bordered square in the input.\n2.  The yellow pixels in the output form two diagonal lines (slope +1 and -1).\n3.  The intersection point of these diagonal lines corresponds to the location of a *single* yellow pixel in the input grid *that is not part of the 3x3 square*.\n4.  The original 3x3 yellow-bordered square from the input is then \"pasted\" back onto the output grid *after* the background and diagonals are drawn, overwriting those cells.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Identify the 3x3 square to find the background color and its location.\n2.  Identify the *other* single yellow pixel (the 'marker pixel').\n3.  Construct the output grid: fill with the background color, draw the two yellow diagonals centered on the marker pixel, and finally paste the original 3x3 square back on top.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's confirm the locations and colors.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 15x20\n    *   3x3 Square Location (Top-Left): (7, 4)\n    *   Center Pixel: (8, 5), Color: 7 (orange) -> Background Color\n    *   Other Yellow 'Marker' Pixel: (4, 15)\n    *   Output Diagonals expected through (4, 15): y = x + 11, y = -x + 19\n    *   3x3 Square to paste back: input[7:10, 4:7]\n    *   Expected Output Yellow Count vs Code Output Yellow Count: The code preserved 9 input yellows. The expected output has many more yellows along diagonals (around 15+20 - 1 (overlap) + 8 (pasted square border) - overlaps = ~30-35 yellows?). Let's count exactly.\n"
