**Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed that *all* yellow pixels from the input grid should be preserved in the output. The results clearly show this is not the case; the yellow pixels in the output follow a different pattern.

Specifically:
1.  The background color *is* correctly determined by the center pixel of the unique 3x3 yellow-bordered square in the input.
2.  The yellow pixels in the output form two diagonal lines (slope +1 and -1).
3.  The intersection point of these diagonal lines corresponds to the location of a *single* yellow pixel in the input grid *that is not part of the 3x3 square*.
4.  The original 3x3 yellow-bordered square from the input is then "pasted" back onto the output grid *after* the background and diagonals are drawn, overwriting those cells.

The strategy is to:
1.  Identify the 3x3 square to find the background color and its location.
2.  Identify the *other* single yellow pixel (the 'marker pixel').
3.  Construct the output grid: fill with the background color, draw the two yellow diagonals centered on the marker pixel, and finally paste the original 3x3 square back on top.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's confirm the locations and colors.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Size: 15x20
    *   3x3 Square Location (Top-Left): (7, 4)
    *   Center Pixel: (8, 5), Color: 7 (orange) -> Background Color
    *   Other Yellow 'Marker' Pixel: (4, 15)
    *   Output Diagonals expected through (4, 15): y = x + 11, y = -x + 19
    *   3x3 Square to paste back: input[7:10, 4:7]
    *   Expected Output Yellow Count vs Code Output Yellow Count: The code preserved 9 input yellows. The expected output has many more yellows along diagonals (around 15+20 - 1 (overlap) + 8 (pasted square border) - overlaps = ~30-35 yellows?). Let's count exactly.
