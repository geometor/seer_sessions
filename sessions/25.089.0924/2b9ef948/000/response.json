            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are generally sparse, containing mostly the white background (0). There are consistently two distinct visual structures present.\n2.  **Structure 1 (Yellow Square):** A 3x3 square pattern is always present. This square consists of 8 yellow (4) pixels forming a border around a single central pixel. The central pixel's color varies between examples (orange (7) in train\\_1, green (3) in train\\_2, azure (8) in train\\_3) but is never yellow (4) or white (0).\n3.  **Structure 2 (Gray Shape):** A shape composed primarily of gray (5) pixels exists elsewhere in the grid. This shape varies (L-shape, line) and often has one adjacent or nearby pixel whose color matches the central pixel of the yellow square. There might also be other isolated pixels (like the yellow (4) near the gray line in train\\_3).\n4.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input. It is almost entirely filled with a single color. This fill color corresponds exactly to the color of the central pixel found within the 3x3 yellow square in the input.\n5.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The primary transformation involves identifying the central color of the 3x3 yellow square and using it as a background fill for the output.\n    *   The 8 yellow (4) pixels that formed the border of the square in the input are preserved in their original locations in the output, overlaying the background fill.\n    *   All other elements from the input grid, including the gray (5) shapes, the associated colored pixel near the gray shape, and any other isolated pixels (even other yellow ones, like in train\\_3), are completely removed or replaced by the background fill color in the output.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
