Input_Elements:
  - Type: Background
    Color: white (0)
  - Type: Pattern
    Name: YellowSquare
    Shape: 3x3
    Composition:
      - Pixels: 8
        Color: yellow (4)
        Arrangement: Border
      - Pixel: 1
        Color: Variable (non-yellow, non-white)
        Arrangement: Center
    Present_In_Examples: [train_1, train_2, train_3]
  - Type: Pattern
    Name: GrayShape
    Shape: Variable (L-shape, line)
    Composition:
      - Pixels: Multiple
        Color: gray (5)
      - Pixel: 1 (Optional/Associated)
        Color: Matches YellowSquare center color
        Arrangement: Adjacent/Nearby
    Present_In_Examples: [train_1, train_2, train_3]
  - Type: Pixel (Occasional)
    Color: Variable (e.g., yellow (4) in train_3)
    Location: Separate from YellowSquare

Output_Elements:
  - Type: Background
    Color: Corresponds to the central color of the input YellowSquare
    Extent: Full grid dimensions
  - Type: Pattern (Overlay)
    Name: YellowBorder
    Shape: 3x3 (implicit, from preserved pixels)
    Composition:
      - Pixels: 8
        Color: yellow (4)
    Location: Same coordinates as the yellow pixels of the input YellowSquare

Transformation_Actions:
  - Action: Identify
    Target: YellowSquare pattern in input
  - Action: Extract
    Source: Center pixel of YellowSquare
    Attribute: Color (Result: BackgroundFillColor)
  - Action: Create
    Object: Output grid
    Properties: Same dimensions as input
  - Action: Fill
    Target: Output grid
    Color: BackgroundFillColor
  - Action: Preserve/Overlay
    Source: 8 yellow (4) border pixels of input YellowSquare
    Target: Corresponding locations in output grid
  - Action: Discard/Ignore
    Target: All other input pixels (gray shape, associated pixel, background, other isolated pixels)

Relationships:
  - The output background color is determined solely by the central pixel color of the input YellowSquare.
  - The positions of the 8 yellow pixels from the input YellowSquare are maintained in the output.
  - The GrayShape and its associated elements appear irrelevant to the output generation, except perhaps as distractors or confirming the uniqueness of the YellowSquare pattern.
