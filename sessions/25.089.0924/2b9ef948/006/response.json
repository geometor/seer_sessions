            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous transformation logic was incorrect because it only considered the 'marker' yellow pixel and the diagonals passing through it, neglecting the original 8 yellow pixels from the 3x3 square. The comparison between the expected outputs and the previously generated outputs clearly shows this discrepancy. The expected outputs consistently contain *both* the original 8 yellow border pixels *and* the diagonals associated with the marker pixel.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the transformation logic to combine these two elements:\n1.  Identify the 3x3 yellow-bordered square and its center color.\n2.  Identify the 'marker' yellow pixel (the one *not* part of the square's border).\n3.  Create the output grid filled with the center color.\n4.  Place the 8 yellow border pixels from the input square onto the output grid at their original coordinates.\n5.  Calculate the coordinates of the two diagonals passing through the marker pixel.\n6.  Place yellow pixels along these diagonals onto the output grid.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe code execution confirms the following for all three training examples:\n*   A unique 3x3 square pattern with 8 yellow border pixels and a non-yellow, non-white center exists.\n*   There are exactly 9 yellow pixels in total in the input grid.\n*   Subtracting the 8 border pixel coordinates from the set of all yellow pixel coordinates leaves exactly one coordinate, which is the 'marker' pixel.\n    *   Example 1: Square at (7, 4), Center Orange (7), Marker at (4, 15).\n    *   Example 2: Square at (12, 15), Center Green (3), Marker at (28, 10).\n    *   Example 3: Square at (11, 10), Center Azure (8), Marker at (24, 24).\n\nThis confirms the presence and uniqueness of both the 3x3 square and the marker pixel in each example.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
