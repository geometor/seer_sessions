**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous transformation logic was incorrect because it only considered the 'marker' yellow pixel and the diagonals passing through it, neglecting the original 8 yellow pixels from the 3x3 square. The comparison between the expected outputs and the previously generated outputs clearly shows this discrepancy. The expected outputs consistently contain *both* the original 8 yellow border pixels *and* the diagonals associated with the marker pixel.

The strategy is to revise the transformation logic to combine these two elements:
1.  Identify the 3x3 yellow-bordered square and its center color.
2.  Identify the 'marker' yellow pixel (the one *not* part of the square's border).
3.  Create the output grid filled with the center color.
4.  Place the 8 yellow border pixels from the input square onto the output grid at their original coordinates.
5.  Calculate the coordinates of the two diagonals passing through the marker pixel.
6.  Place yellow pixels along these diagonals onto the output grid.

**Metrics:**

The code execution confirms the following for all three training examples:
*   A unique 3x3 square pattern with 8 yellow border pixels and a non-yellow, non-white center exists.
*   There are exactly 9 yellow pixels in total in the input grid.
*   Subtracting the 8 border pixel coordinates from the set of all yellow pixel coordinates leaves exactly one coordinate, which is the 'marker' pixel.
    *   Example 1: Square at (7, 4), Center Orange (7), Marker at (4, 15).
    *   Example 2: Square at (12, 15), Center Green (3), Marker at (28, 10).
    *   Example 3: Square at (11, 10), Center Azure (8), Marker at (24, 24).

This confirms the presence and uniqueness of both the 3x3 square and the marker pixel in each example.

      Color: yellow (4)
      Location: Defined by passing through the Marker_Pixel's Coordinate from input.
      Interaction: Overlays the Background_Color. May overlap with Preserved_Border pixels.

Transformation_Actions:
  - Find: The Defining_Square in the input grid.
  - Extract: The Center_Color from the Defining_Square.
  - Extract: The Border_Pixels_Coords from the Defining_Square.
  - Find: All yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
  - Identify: The Marker_Pixel Coordinate by finding the yellow pixel coordinate not in Border_Pixels_Coords.
  - Create: Output grid with dimensions matching the input grid.
  - Fill: Output grid entirely with the extracted Center_Color.
  - Draw: Place yellow (4) pixels onto the output grid at the Border_Pixels_Coords.
  - Calculate: Coordinates for pixels on the two diagonals (r-c = marker_r-marker_c and r+c = marker_r+marker_c) within grid bounds.
  - Draw: Place yellow (4) pixels onto the output grid at the calculated diagonal coordinates.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to find the unique 3x3 pattern composed of 8 yellow (4) border pixels and one central, non-yellow, non-white pixel. Record the color of the central pixel (`background_color`) and the coordinates of the 8 yellow border pixels (`border_coords`).
2.  Find the coordinates of all yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. Identify the single coordinate (`marker_coord`) that is present in the list of all yellow pixels but is *not* among the `border_coords`.
3.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4.  Fill the entire output grid with the `background_color`.
5.  For each coordinate in `border_coords`, set the pixel at that coordinate in the output grid to yellow (4).
6.  Determine the row (`marker_r`) and column (`marker_c`) from `marker_coord`.
7.  Iterate through all possible row (`r`) and column (`c`) coordinates within the output grid's boundaries.
8.  If a coordinate (r, c) satisfies the condition `r - c == marker_r - marker_c` (first diagonal) OR `r + c == marker_r + marker_c` (second diagonal), set the pixel at (r, c) in the output grid to yellow (4).
9.  Return the completed output grid.
