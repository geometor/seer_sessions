Input_Grid:
  Objects:
    - Name: Background
      Color: white (0)
    - Name: Defining_Square
      Shape: 3x3
      Pattern: 8 yellow (4) pixels bordering 1 non-yellow/non-white center pixel
      Properties:
        - Center_Color: Variable (determines output background)
        - Border_Pixels_Coords: Set of 8 (row, col) tuples (preserved in output)
        - Top_Left_Coord: (row, col)
    - Name: Marker_Pixel
      Color: yellow (4)
      Quantity: 1
      Definition: The single yellow pixel that is NOT part of the Defining_Square's border.
      Properties:
        - Coordinate: (row, col) (determines diagonal lines in output)
    - Name: Distractor_Pattern (Optional/Irrelevant)
      Color: gray (5) and one pixel matching Center_Color
      Shape: Variable
Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Same as Input_Grid
    - Background_Color: Same as Center_Color of Input_Grid's Defining_Square
  Objects:
    - Name: Preserved_Border
      Shape: Implicit 3x3 border
      Color: yellow (4)
      Quantity: 8 pixels
      Location: Same coordinates as the Defining_Square's Border_Pixels_Coords from input.
    - Name: Diagonal_Cross
      Shape: Two intersecting diagonal lines (slope +1 and -1)
      Color: yellow (4)
      Location: Defined by passing through the Marker_Pixel's Coordinate from input.
      Interaction: Overlays the Background_Color. May overlap with Preserved_Border pixels.

Transformation_Actions:
  - Find: The Defining_Square in the input grid.
  - Extract: The Center_Color from the Defining_Square.
  - Extract: The Border_Pixels_Coords from the Defining_Square.
  - Find: All yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
  - Identify: The Marker_Pixel Coordinate by finding the yellow pixel coordinate not in Border_Pixels_Coords.
  - Create: Output grid with dimensions matching the input grid.
  - Fill: Output grid entirely with the extracted Center_Color.
  - Draw: Place yellow (4) pixels onto the output grid at the Border_Pixels_Coords.
  - Calculate: Coordinates for pixels on the two diagonals (r-c = marker_r-marker_c and r+c = marker_r+marker_c) within grid bounds.
  - Draw: Place yellow (4) pixels onto the output grid at the calculated diagonal coordinates.
