            "text": "    Most frequent non-zero is Red (2). Scattered.\n\nThis doesn't help determine the destination.\n\nLet's revisit the idea of a marker object. What if the marker object isn't a single pixel, but another shape?\n*   Ex 1: Unique object is Azure (8). No other obvious simple shapes stand out besides the scattered Green and Yellow pixels. Destination TL (7, 11).\n*   Ex 2: Unique object is Red (2). Are there any other simple shapes? The Azure (8) pixels form scattered points and small lines, e.g., three 8s at (15, 0). A 2x1 line at (8,4). Destination TL (13, 9).\n*   Ex 3: Unique object is Yellow (4). Scattered Red (2) and Green (3) pixels. Destination TL (14, 10).\n\nCould the destination be related to the coordinates of the unique object's color *if it appeared elsewhere*?\n*   Ex 1: Azure (8) only appears in the main object.\n*   Ex 2: Red (2) only appears in the main object.\n*   Ex 3: Yellow (4) only appears in the main object.\n\nOkay, maybe the destination isn't marked by *color*, but by *shape*. Is there another shape in the input that matches the unique-color object's shape, regardless of color?\n*   Ex 1: Azure object shape. Are there other 4x5 (or similar sized) rectangular-ish shapes? Not obvious.\n*   Ex 2: Red object shape (5x4 'C'/'U'). Are there other shapes like this? Maybe formed by Blue (1) pixels? Hard to tell.\n*   Ex 3: Yellow object shape (5x6 hollow rectangle). Are there other shapes like this? Not obviously.\n\nLet's assume the identification is correct: Find the single object whose color appears only within that object.\nHow is the destination determined?\n\nConsider the *transformation* itself. It's a copy/paste operation. The original object remains. The copy overwrites whatever was at the destination.\n\nWhat if the destination is relative to the *center* of the grid?\nGrid size 21x21. Center pixel (10, 10).\n*   Ex 1: Unique object TL (10, 3). Dest TL (7, 11). Vector from center (10, 10) to Dest TL is (-3, +1). Vector from center (10, 10) to Source TL is (0, -7). No obvious relation.\n*   Ex 2: Unique object TL (2, 6). Dest TL (13, 9). Vector from center (10, 10) to Dest TL is (+3, -1). Vector from center (10, 10) to Source TL is (-8, -4). No obvious relation.\n*   Ex 3: Unique object TL (3, 4). Dest TL (14, 10). Vector from center (10, 10) to Dest TL is (+4, 0). Vector from center (10, 10) to Source TL is (-7, -6). No obvious relation.\n\nIs the destination related to some property of the unique object?\n*   Ex 1: Azure object (8). Size 4x5=20 pixels (actual count is 14). TL (10, 3). Dest TL (7, 11).\n*   Ex 2: Red object (2). Size 5x4=20 pixels (actual count is 14). TL (2, 6). Dest TL (13, 9).\n*   Ex 3: Yellow object (4). Size 5x6=30 pixels (actual count is 18). TL (3, 4). Dest TL (14, 10).\n\nLet's look at the input grids more abstractly. They seem to be noisy backgrounds with one distinct shape embedded. The task is to find that distinct shape and duplicate it somewhere else.\n\nCould the destination be determined by finding a location that *minimizes overlap* with existing non-background pixels? Or maximizes overlap with background (0) pixels?\n*   Ex 1: Dest area (7, 11) to (10, 15). Input pixels in that area: mixture of 0, 3, 4.\n*   Ex 2: Dest area (13, 9) to (17, 12). Input pixels in that area: mixture of 0, 1, 8.\n*   Ex 3: Dest area (14, 10) to (18, 15). Input pixels in that area: mixture of 0, 2, 3.\n\nThis doesn't seem like a constraint. The copy simply overwrites.\n\nWhat if the destination is found by reflecting the source object's position across some axis or point?\n*   Ex 1: Source TL (10, 3). Grid center (10, 10). Reflect across center: (10 + (10-10), 10 + (10-3)) = (10, 17). Not (7, 11). Reflect across horizontal midline (y=10): (10, 10 + (10-3)) = (10, 17). Not (7, 11). Reflect across vertical midline (x=10): (10 + (10-10), 3) = (10, 3). Not (7, 11). Reflect across main diagonal (y=x): (3, 10). Not (7, 11). Reflect across anti-diagonal (y=20-x): (20-3, 20-10) = (17, 10). Not (7, 11).\n*   Ex 2: Source TL (2, 6). Grid center (10, 10). Reflect across center: (10 + (10-2), 10 + (10-6)) = (18, 14). Not (13, 9).\n*   Ex 3: Source TL (3, 4). Grid center (10, 10). Reflect across center: (10 + (10-3), 10 + (10-4)) = (17, 16). Not (14, 10).\n\nSymmetry/Reflection doesn't seem to be it.\n\nLet's reconsider Example 1. Input has *one* Azure object. Output has *two*.\nMaybe the input *always* has exactly *two* objects of the *same* special color (Azure/Red/Yellow)? And the task is to move one of them?\nLet's re-examine the inputs carefully.\n*   Ex 1 Input: Scan for Azure (8). Only occurs at (10,3)-(13,7). Just one object.\n*   Ex 2 Input: Scan for Red (2). Only occurs at (2,6)-(6,9). Just one object.\n*   Ex 3 Input: Scan for Yellow (4). Only occurs at (3,4)-(7,9). Just one object.\n\nSo the operation is definitely duplication/copying, not moving.\n\nCould the destination be related to the *only* pixel of a specific color, say Gray (5)?\n*   Ex 1: No Gray pixels.\n*   Ex 2: No Gray pixels.\n*   Ex 3: No Gray pixels.\n\nWhat if the destination location (TL corner) is encoded by the properties of the unique object?\n*   Ex 1: Azure (8). TL(10,3). Size (4x5). Color 8. Dest TL (7, 11). How to get (7, 11) from (10, 3), 4, 5, 8?\n*   Ex 2: Red (2). TL(2,6). Size (5x4). Color 2. Dest TL (13, 9). How to get (13, 9) from (2, 6), 5, 4, 2?\n*   Ex 3: Yellow (4). TL(3,4). Size (5x6). Color 4. Dest TL (14, 10). How to get (14, 10) from (3, 4), 5, 6, 4?\n\nLet's look for simple arithmetic:\n*   Ex 1: Dest R = 7, Dest C = 11. Source R=10, C=3. H=4, W=5. Color=8.\n    *   R: 10 - 3 = 7? No. 10 - H/2? No. 10 - W/2? No. C+H = 3+4 = 7? YES.\n    *   C: 11. R+W/W? No. R+H-W? No. R + C - H? 10+3-4 = 9. No. R + (C // W)? No. R + (W // C)? No. R + (H % C)? 10 + (4%3) = 11? YES.\n    *   Hypothesis: Dest R = Source C + Height. Dest C = Source R + (Height % Source C).\n*   Ex 2: Dest R = 13, Dest C = 9. Source R=2, C=6. H=5, W=4. Color=2.\n    *   Check R: Source C + Height = 6 + 5 = 11. Not 13. Hypothesis fails.\n\nLet's try other combinations.\n*   Ex 1: Dest R=7, Dest C=11. Src R=10, Src C=3, H=4, W=5.\n*   Ex 2: Dest R=13, Dest C=9. Src R=2, Src C=6, H=5, W=4.\n*   Ex 3: Dest R=14, Dest C=10. Src R=3, Src C=4, H=5, W=6. (Note: H=5, W=6 for bbox, actual shape is hollow). Let's use BBox H/W.\n\nMaybe the Height/Width isn't the BBox H/W, but the count of rows/columns the object spans?\n*   Ex 1: Spans rows 10-13 (4 rows). Spans cols 3-7 (5 cols). H=4, W=5.\n*   Ex 2: Spans rows 2-6 (5 rows). Spans cols 6-9 (4 cols). H=5, W=4.\n*   Ex 3: Spans rows 3-7 (5 rows). Spans cols 4-9 (6 cols). H=5, W=6.\nSo bbox height/width seems correct.\n\nIs there *any* single pixel of color Azure (8) in *every* input?\n*   Ex 1: Yes, the object itself is Azure.\n*   Ex 2: Yes, multiple scattered Azure pixels.\n*   Ex 3: No Azure pixels.\n\nHypothesis discarded.\n\nLet's step back. The core elements are:\n1.  Background noise (colors 0, 1, 3 in Ex 1; 0, 1, 8 in Ex 2; 0, 2, 3 in Ex 3). Wait, the 'noise' colors change. Let's redefine: Background seems to be 0 (White). Other colors (1, 3, 4, etc. in Ex1; 1, 8 in Ex2; 2, 3 in Ex3) form a kind of texture or pattern.\n2.  One unique-color object (Azure 8 in Ex1; Red 2 in Ex2; Yellow 4 in Ex3). This object's color does not appear anywhere else.\n3.  The transformation copies this unique-color object to a new location.\n\nThe crucial missing piece is how the destination is calculated.\n\nCould it be related to the *pixels* within the unique object?\n*   Ex 1: Pixels are at (10,3), (10,4)... (13,7). Total 14 pixels. Dest TL (7, 11).\n*   Ex 2: Pixels are at (2,6), (2,7)... (6,9). Total 14 pixels. Dest TL (13, 9).\n*   Ex 3: Pixels are at (3,4), (3,5)... (7,9). Total 18 pixels. Dest TL (14, 10).\n\nLook at the examples again. Is there *any* other salient feature?\nIn Ex 1, the object is Azure (8). The copy destination TL is (7, 11).\nIn Ex 2, the object is Red (2). There are many Azure (8) pixels scattered. Destination TL (13, 9).\nIn Ex 3, the object is Yellow (4). Destination TL (14, 10).\n\nWhat if the destination is marked by the location of the *only* pixel(s) of a certain color *relative* to the unique object?\nFor Ex 2: Unique object is Red(2). Are there unique Azure(8) pixels? No, there are many.\nWhat if the destination is marked by the *location* where the unique object's color *would* complete a pattern if it were placed there? Seems too complex.\n\nLet's assume the unique-color object identification is correct.\nLet source object S have top-left (SR, SC), height H, width W, color C.\nLet destination object D have top-left (DR, DC).\nWe need functions f, g such that DR = f(SR, SC, H, W, C, grid) and DC = g(SR, SC, H, W, C, grid).\n\nConsider the possibility that the destination is fixed relative to some grid feature *other* than the unique object itself.\nE.g., Is there a single largest hole (contiguous area of 0s)?\n*   Ex 1: Largest hole might be around (18, 0) to (20, 6)? Hard to eyeball. Dest TL (7, 11) isn't near there.\n*   Ex 2: Large hole bottom right. Dest TL (13, 9).\n*   Ex 3: Large hole near center-bottom. Dest TL (14, 10).\n\nThis seems unlikely. The destination seems related *to* the source object somehow.\n\nLet's look at the change between input and output. Only the copied object area is changed.\nInput[DR:DR+H, DC:DC+W] is overwritten by the shape of the source object S, using color C.\n\nThink about the priors: Objectness, Goal-directedness, Numbers/Counting, Geometry/Topology.\nWe identified an object based on its color property (uniqueness). We are performing a geometric operation (copy/translation). We need to find the translation vector.\n\nCould the translation vector be encoded in the grid using other colors?\nLook at Ex 2 again. Unique object Red (2). Scattered Azure (8) pixels. Dest TL (13, 9).\nAny Azure pixel near (13, 9)? Yes, (13, 13), (14, 8), (14, 12), (15, 7), (15, 11).\nMaybe the destination TL is the location of an Azure pixel?\nLet's check: Is (13, 9) an Azure pixel coordinate? No.\nIs it adjacent to one? Yes, adjacent to (14, 8). (Diagonal adjacency).\nLet's test this: Destination TL = coordinates of an Azure (8) pixel, or adjacent to one?\n*   Ex 1: Unique object is Azure (8). Where should it be copied? Maybe copy it centered on the single non-object Azure pixel? But there isn't one. Maybe the rule is: If the unique object is *not* Azure (8), find an Azure (8) pixel and use its location (or adjacent) as the destination TL. If the unique object *is* Azure (8), use a default location or a different rule. What could the default rule be? Maybe reflect across center? No, we checked that. Maybe a fixed offset? No, offsets varied. Maybe relative to grid center? (-3, +1) from center (10,10) gives (7, 11). Let's check this part for Ex 1.\n*   Ex 2: Unique object is Red (2). Find Azure pixels. One is at (14, 8). Destination TL (13, 9) is diagonally adjacent. Could the rule be: Find the Azure (8) pixel (maybe the top-leftmost one? or lowest-row one? or closest-to-center one?) Let's try top-leftmost: (2, 3). Use adjacent? (1, 4)? (3, 4)? etc. No. Closest to center (10, 10)? Maybe (12, 7). Adjacent? (11, 6), (11, 7), (11, 8), (12, 6), (12, 8), (13, 6), (13, 7), (13, 8). None are (13, 9). What about the Azure pixel at (14, 8)? Adjacent coordinates are (13,7), (13,8), (13,9), (14,7), (14,9), (15,7), (15,8), (15,9). Yes, (13, 9) is adjacent (specifically, top-left neighbor) to the Azure pixel at (14, 8). Which Azure pixel is (14, 8)? Is it special? It's not the topmost, leftmost, bottommost, rightmost, or closest to center.\n*   Ex 3: Unique object is Yellow (4). No Azure pixels. Dest TL (14, 10). How is this determined? If the rule depends on Azure pixels, it fails here.\n\nOkay, the Azure marker idea is flawed.\n\nLet's revisit the \"unique color object\" idea. Is it truly the *only* object of that color?\n*   Ex 1: Yes, only Azure (8) object.\n*   Ex 2: Yes, only Red (2) object.\n*   Ex 3: Yes, only Yellow (4) object.\n\nIs the destination related to the location of pixels of the *same color* as the unique object's color's index?\n*   Ex 1: Object color Azure (8). Are there pixels at row/col 8? Pixel (8, 11) is 0. Pixel (8, 8) is 4. Pixel (11, 8) is 3. No obvious link. Dest TL (7, 11).\n*   Ex 2: Object color Red (2). Look at row/col 2. Pixel (2, 2) is 0. Pixel (13, 2) is 8. Pixel (18, 2) is 8. Dest TL (13, 9). Is it related to pixel (13, 2)?\n*   Ex 3: Object color Yellow (4). Look at row/col 4. Pixel (4, 4) is 4 (part of the object!). Pixel (14, 4) is 3. Pixel (16, 4) is 3. Dest TL (14, 10). Is it related to pixel (14, 4)?\n\nHypothesis: Dest R = Row index `k` such that pixel (k, C) exists (where C is the object's color index). Dest C = Col index `j` such that pixel (C, j) exists? This seems arbitrary.\n\nLet's reconsider the core task: Copy a specific object.\nWhat defines the object? Uniqueness of its color within the grid.\nWhat defines the destination? Still unknown.\n\nCould the destination be encoded by the *shape* in some way? Like finding a matching shape elsewhere? No, we didn't see obvious matches.\n\nIs it possible the destination is constant relative to the *grid size*? All grids are 21x21.\nDest TLs: (7, 11), (13, 9), (14, 10). Not constant.\n\nWhat if we find the bounding box of *all* non-white pixels?\n*   Ex 1: TL(0,0), BR(20,20). Whole grid.\n*   Ex 2: TL(0,1), BR(20,20). Almost whole grid.\n*   Ex 3: TL(0,2), BR(20,20). Almost whole grid.\nDoesn't help narrow down the location.\n\nLet's try identifying the object differently. Maybe it's the object with the highest color index?\n*   Ex 1: Max index is 8 (Azure). Yes.\n*   Ex 2: Max index is 8 (Azure). But the copied object is Red (2). Fails.\n\nMaybe it's the object whose color index matches some global property? Like grid height mod 10? Grid H=21. 21 mod 10 = 1. Select object with color 1? No.\n\nLet's assume the \"unique color object\" identification is correct.\nFocus only on the destination coordinates (DR, DC): (7, 11), (13, 9), (14, 10).\nSource coordinates (SR, SC): (10, 3), (2, 6), (3, 4).\nHeights H: 4, 5, 5.\nWidths W: 5, 4, 6.\nColors C: 8, 2, 4.\n\nIs DR related to SC? (7 vs 3), (13 vs 6), (14 vs 4). Maybe DR = SC + constant? No. DR = 2*SC + 1? (7 vs 2*3+1=7), (13 vs 2*6+1=13), (14 vs 2*4+1=9). Fails on Ex3.\nIs DC related to SR? (11 vs 10), (9 vs 2), (10 vs 3). Maybe DC = SR + constant? No. DC = SR + 1? (11 vs 10+1=11), (9 vs 2+1=3). Fails on Ex2.\n\nIs there a pattern if we sort by source row?\nSR=2, SC=6, H=5, W=4, C=2 -> DR=13, DC=9\nSR=3, SC=4, H=5, W=6, C=4 -> DR=14, DC=10\nSR=10, SC=3, H=4, W=5, C=8 -> DR=7, DC=11\n\nLook at the relationships:\nEx 2: DR = SR + 11, DC = SC + 3\nEx 3: DR = SR + 11, DC = SC + 6\nEx 1: DR = SR - 3, DC = SC + 8\n\nThe DR offset is +11 for SR=2 and SR=3, but -3 for SR=10.\nThe DC offset depends on SC and maybe W? DC offset = 3 (SC=6, W=4), 6 (SC=4, W=6), 8 (SC=3, W=5).\nIs DC offset related to W? Maybe DC offset = W - 1? (4-1=3), (6-1=5, not 6), (5-1=4, not 8). No.\nMaybe DC offset = W + k? 4+k=3 -> k=-1. 6+k=6 -> k=0. 5+k=8 -> k=3. No.\nMaybe DC offset = SC + k? 6+k=3 -> k=-3. 4+k=6 -> k=2. 3+k=8 -> k=5. No.\n\nLet's assume the identification \"Find the contiguous object whose color C appears nowhere else in the grid\" is correct.\nThe transformation is \"Copy this object to a destination (DR, DC)\".\n\nThe destination calculation is the mystery. If I can't find a rule based on coordinates, sizes, colors, or grid features, perhaps it's simpler. What if the destination is always the same *relative position* within the grid, regardless of the source object?\nNo, the destinations (7, 11), (13, 9), (14, 10) are different.\n\nIs the destination the location of the *only* pixel of the color C+1 or C-1?\n*   Ex 1: C=8. Look for color 7 (Orange) or 9 (Maroon). None exist.\n*   Ex 2: C=2. Look for color 1 (Blue) or 3 (Green). Both exist scattered. Not unique pixels.\n*   Ex 3: C=4. Look for color 3 (Green) or 5 (Gray). Green exists scattered. Gray does not exist.\n\nCould the destination be related to the *count* of pixels of the unique color?\n*   Ex 1: Color 8, count 14. Dest (7, 11).\n*   Ex 2: Color 2, count 14. Dest (13, 9).\n*   Ex 3: Color 4, count 18. Dest (14, 10).\nNo obvious link between count and destination.\n\nFinal hypothesis attempt: The task involves finding the unique-color object and copying it. The destination *must* be derivable from the input state. Given the difficulty in finding a geometric or marker-based rule, perhaps it's related to the bounding box + color index in a non-obvious way, or maybe there's a simpler concept I'm missing. What if the location is simply the location of the *other* object of the same shape? But there isn't one.\n\nLet's stick to the simplest robust observation:\n1. Identify the object O composed of pixels of color C, such that no pixel outside of O has color C.\n2. Copy object O to a new location (DR, DC), overwriting existing pixels.\n\nThe destination (DR, DC) remains elusive. However, the YAML and Natural Language program should reflect the parts we *are* confident about. Acknowledge the uncertainty about the destination calculation. The coder phase might require more exploration or make an assumption.\n\nFor the Natural Language Program:\n1. Find the single contiguous object composed of a color that does not appear anywhere else in the grid. Let this object be the 'source object' and its color be C.\n2. Determine the destination top-left coordinate (DR, DC). [Describe how this is done - currently unclear, needs hypothesis]. **Let's assume for now the destination is derived from source coordinates, dimensions, and color via some unknown function.**\n3. Create a copy of the source object.\n4. Place the copy onto the grid, starting at the destination coordinate (DR, DC), overwriting any existing pixels at that location. The color of the copied object is C.\n\nHow to represent the unknown destination rule? Perhaps state the observed destinations for the examples and note the lack of a clear general rule found so far. The coder might need to infer or test hypotheses for this step.\n\nLet's refine the facts based on this: focus on the unique color object property.\n\nYAML Facts Structure:\n- Grid properties: dimensions\n- Objects:\n    - Background/Noise pixels\n    - Unique-Color Object:\n        - Color\n        - Pixels / Bounding Box\n        - Property: Color is unique to this object\n    - Copied Object (in output):\n        - Location (derived)\n        - Shape (same as source)\n        - Color (same as source)\n- Transformation:\n    - Identification: Find unique-color object\n    - Action: Copy object\n    - Destination: Determine target location (rule TBD)\n    - Result: Paste copy at target location\n\nThis seems like a reasonable plan.Okay, let's break down the task based on the examples provided.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe input grids appear to contain a background field of pixels (often white, but sometimes including scattered pixels of other colors like blue, green, red, yellow depending on the example) and one prominent, contiguous object made of a single color (Azure, Red, or Yellow in the examples). The key feature of this prominent object is that its color appears *only* within that object; it's unique in the grid.\n\nThe transformation involves duplicating this unique-color object. The original object remains untouched in its position. A copy of the object (same shape, same color) is created and placed at a different location on the grid. The copied object overwrites any pixels previously occupying the destination area.\n\nThe main challenge lies in determining the precise rule for calculating the destination coordinates (the top-left corner) for the copied object. While the source object is clearly identifiable by its unique color, the destination calculation is not immediately obvious from simple geometric relationships (reflection, translation relative to center, fixed offset) or clear markers in the grid across all examples. However, a rule must exist based on the input state.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
