Task: CopyUniqueColorObject

Priors_Used:
  - Objectness: Identifying contiguous blocks of color as objects.
  - Geometry: Recognizing shape and performing copy/translation.
  - Uniqueness: Identifying an object based on a unique property (its color).

Input_Grid:
  - Contains various pixel colors.
  - Often includes a background color (e.g., white=0) and scattered noise/texture pixels.
  - Contains exactly one 'Source Object'.

Source_Object:
  - Property: Is a contiguous block of pixels of a single color C.
  - Property: Color C does not appear anywhere else in the Input_Grid outside of this object.
  - Attributes:
    - Color: C (e.g., Azure=8, Red=2, Yellow=4 in examples)
    - Shape: Defined by the relative positions of its constituent pixels.
    - Location: Defined by its pixel coordinates (e.g., top-left coordinate).
    - Bounding_Box: Defined by min/max row/column.

Transformation:
  - Step_1_Identify: Find the Source_Object based on its unique color property.
  - Step_2_Determine_Destination: Calculate the top-left coordinate (DR, DC) for the copy. (The exact rule for this calculation requires further inference or hypothesis testing, as it's not immediately clear from the examples, but it depends on the input state).
  - Step_3_Copy: Create a pixel-perfect copy of the Source_Object's shape and color C.
  - Step_4_Paste: Place the copy onto the grid such that its top-left pixel is at (DR, DC). Pixels from the copy overwrite existing grid pixels in the destination area.

Output_Grid:
  - Identical to the Input_Grid, except for the area where the copy was pasted.
  - Contains the original Source_Object.
  - Contains the newly placed copy of the Source_Object at coordinates (DR, DC).
