Transformation Rule:
1. Identify a single contiguous object within the input grid that is composed of a unique color (a color C that appears nowhere else in the grid).
2. Determine the destination top-left coordinates (DR, DC) for copying this object. The specific rule for calculating these coordinates based on the input grid state is currently undetermined from the provided examples.
3. Create a copy of the unique-color object's shape and color.
4. Paste this copy onto the grid starting at the destination coordinates (DR, DC), overwriting any existing pixels in that area. The original unique-color object remains in its place.
