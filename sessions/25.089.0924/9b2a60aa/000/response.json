The progression (which coordinate changes and by how much) seems specific to the task instance but consistent within it. The markers are processed in a specific order (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Identify the 'template' shape: Find the largest connected component of red (2) pixels in the input grid. Determine the relative coordinates of all pixels belonging to this shape with respect to its top-left bounding box corner.\n    3.  Identify the 'marker' pixels: Find all non-white pixels in the input grid that are *not* part of the identified template shape and are isolated (have no adjacent neighbors of the same color, excluding diagonals). Record the color and position (row, column) of each marker pixel.\n    4.  Order the marker pixels: Create a list of the identified marker pixels, sorted first by row index (ascending) and then by column index (ascending).\n    5.  If there are fewer than two marker pixels, stop (or handle based on expected behavior, though examples suggest at least two).\n    6.  Determine the placement rule:\n        a.  Take the first marker pixel (`m1`) from the ordered list and find the top-left position (`c1_tl`) of the corresponding colored copy of the template shape in the *example output grid*. Calculate the base offset: `base_delta = (c1_tl.row - m1.row, c1_tl.col - m1.col)`.\n        b.  Take the second marker pixel (`m2`) from the ordered list and find the top-left position (`c2_tl`) of its corresponding copy in the *example output grid*. Calculate the second offset: `delta2 = (c2_tl.row - m2.row, c2_tl.col - m2.col)`.\n        c.  Calculate the step change in the offset: `step = (delta2.row - base_delta.row, delta2.col - base_delta.col)`.\n    7.  Generate and place copies: Iterate through the ordered list of marker pixels, starting with the first marker at index `i = 1`.\n        a.  For the marker `m_i` at index `i` with color `C` and position `(mr, mc)`:\n            i.  Calculate the offset to apply for this marker: `current_delta_row = base_delta.row + (i - 1) * step.row`, `current_delta_col = base_delta.col + (i - 1) * step.col`.\n            ii. Calculate the target top-left position `(tr, tc)` for the copy: `tr = mr + current_delta_row`, `tc = mc + current_delta_col`.\n            iii. For each relative pixel position `(pr, pc)` within the template shape:\n                *   Place a pixel of color `C` at the absolute position `(tr + pr, tc + pc)` in the output grid. Ensure placement stays within grid boundaries.\n    8.  Return the modified output grid."
