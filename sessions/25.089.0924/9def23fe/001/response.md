"""
Transforms the input grid by expanding the area covered by the primary color (red=2). 
Any white pixel (0) in the input grid is changed to red (2) in the output grid if 
either its row or its column contained a red (2) pixel in the input grid. 
All other non-white pixels (including the original red pixels and any marker pixels) 
retain their original color and position.
