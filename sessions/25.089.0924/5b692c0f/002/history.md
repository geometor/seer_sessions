Whoops, the code output shows a change from Green(3) to Yellow(4) at (6, 4). Let me recheck the input/output grids provided in the prompt.

Input Train 2:
Row 6: `0 0 0 0 3 3 4 3 4 3 0 0 0 0` -> Pixel (6, 4) is Green(3).
Output Train 2:
Row 6: `0 0 0 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 0 0 0 0` -> Pixel (6, 4) is Yellow(4).

Okay, so Yellow is NOT static in Train 2 either. A Green pixel at (6,4) became Yellow.

Let's list all changes for Train 2:
*   W(0) -> G(3): (1, 2), (1, 4), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 3), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 4) -> 8 pixels
*   G(3) -> W(0): (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 3) -> 3 pixels
*   G(3) -> Y(4): (6, 4) -> 1 pixel

Net change: +5 Green, +1 Yellow.

*   Consider the G->Y change at (6, 4). Input(6,4)=G3. Neighbors: G(5,4), G(6,3), Y(6,5), G(7,4), G(5,3), Y(5,5)-diag?, G(7,3), G(7,5)=Y4. Let's list neighbors (Moore): G(5,3), G(5,4), Y(5,5)-diag?, G(6,3), Y(6,5), G(7,3), G(7,4), Y(7,5). Wait, input grid has Y at (6,6) and (6,8), and (7,6). Rechecking neighbors of Input(6,4)=G3: N={G(5,3), G(5,4), G(5,5), G(6,3), Y(6,5)=Y4, G(7,3), G(7,4), G(7,5)=Y4}. Has 2 Yellow neighbors. Becomes Yellow.
    *   Compare to Train 1: R(11,13) had 2 Yellow neighbors and became Yellow.
    *   Does any other Green pixel in Train 2 have exactly 2 Yellow neighbors?
        *   Input(6, 5)=Y4. Let's check its neighbors that are Green. Input(5,5)=G3. N(5,5)={G(4,4), G(4,5), Y(4,6), G(5,4), Y(5,6), G(6,4)->Y4, Y(6,5), Y(6,6)}. 3 Yellow neighbors. Stays Green (in intermediate step if G->Y happens first?). No, output(5,5) is Green.
        *   Input(7, 5)=Y4. Neighbors? Input(6,5)=Y4, Input(7,4)=G3, Input(8,4)=G3, Input(8,5)=G3, Input(8,6)=Y4, Input(7,6)=Y4, Input(6,6)=Y4, Input(6,4)->Y4. Let's check Input(7,4)=G3. N(7,4)={G(6,3), Y(6,4)->Y4?, Y(6,5), G(7,3), Y(7,5), G(8,3), G(8,4), G(8,5)}. Has 2 Yellow neighbors (6,5), (7,5). Stays Green.
*   Hypothesis 1: A non-Yellow pixel with exactly 2 Yellow neighbors (in the Moore neighborhood) becomes Yellow in the next step.
    *   Train 1: R(11,13) had Y(11,10-diag), Y(12,11-diag). Needs rechecking adjacency. Neighbors of (11,13): (10,12), (10,13), (10,14), (11,12), (11,14), (12,12), (12,13), (12,14), PLUS DIAG: (10,12), (10,14), (12,12), (12,14). Let's use direct adjacency (Von Neumann) or Moore (8 neighbors).
    *   Assume Moore neighborhood.
    *   Train 1, Input(11,13)=R2. Moore Neighbors: R(10,12), R(10,13), R(10,14), R(11,12), R(11,14), R(12,12), R(12,13), R(12,14). Wait, where were the yellows? Y(10,10), Y(11,8), Y(11,10), Y(12,11), Y(13,10). None of these are Moore neighbors of (11,13). This contradicts the idea that (11,13) became yellow due to yellow neighbors.

Let's reconsider the reflection idea for Train 1, Top Object.
Input rows 1-3 are mirrored below row 4.
Out[1] == In[1]
Out[2] == In[2]
Out[3] == In[3]
Out[4] == In[4] (Axis)
Out[5] == In[3]
Out[6] == In[2]
Out[7] == In[1]
This pattern seems consistent. The object is reflected vertically across the horizontal yellow line(s). The Yellow line acts as a mirror.

Now, let's apply this concept to the other objects.
*   Train 1, Bottom Object: The Yellow pixels are not a simple line. Y(10, 10), Y(11, 8), Y(11, 10), Y(12, 11), Y(13, 10). This is not a horizontal or vertical line. Can an object reflect across point-like or scattered 'mirrors'? That seems unlikely based on ARC priors (geometry).
*   Train 2 Object: Yellow pixels: (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 8), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6). This is mostly a vertical line at col 6, with one extra at (6, 8).
    *   If reflection occurs across the vertical line at col 6:
        *   Pixels at col 6 should remain. Yes, Output[:, 6] == Input[:, 6].
        *   Pixels at col 5 should map to col 7.
            *   Input(1, 5)=3 -> Output(1, 7)=3 (Matches)
            *   Input(2, 5)=3 -> Output(2, 7)=0 (Mismatch Input: 3, Output: 0)
            *   Input(3, 5)=3 -> Output(3, 7)=3 (Matches)
            *   ...
        *   Pixels at col 7 should map to col 5.
            *   Input(1, 7)=0 -> Output(1, 5)=3 (Mismatch Input: 0, Output: 3)
            *   Input(2, 7)=0 -> Output(2, 5)=3 (Mismatch Input: 0, Output: 3)
            *   Input(3, 7)=3 -> Output(3, 5)=3 (Matches)
            *   ...
    *   The reflection isn't simple horizontal reflection across column 6. What about the extra yellow at (6, 8)? Does it affect things? Or the yellow at (7,6)? (Oh, (7,6) is part of the line).

Maybe the Yellow (4) pixels don't cause reflection, but *completion* or *filling*?
*   Train 1, Top: The blue shape above the yellow line seems 'incomplete'. The reflection makes it symmetric across the yellow line.
*   Train 1, Bottom: The red shape seems 'incomplete'. Does the output complete it somehow? The output looks more 'filled in' in some places (W->R changes) and has 'holes' in others (R->W changes). And one R->Y change. This doesn't fit a simple completion rule.
*   Train 2: The green shape seems 'incomplete'. The output fills some holes (W->R) and removes some pixels (R->W). One pixel changes G->Y. Again, not simple completion.

Let's revisit the idea of Yellow being special. Maybe Yellow designates an area or axis for a specific operation *on the other colors*.
*   Train 1, Top: Yellow is a horizontal line (Row 4). The operation is vertical reflection across this line for the Blue object pixels.
*   Train 1, Bottom: Yellow pixels are scattered points. What operation could they designate? No obvious geometric operation. Perhaps they influence neighbors based on *count* or *configuration*. The changes (R->W, W->R, R->Y) seem complex.
*   Train 2: Yellow is mostly a vertical line (Col 6) plus one extra point (6, 8). The operation could be horizontal reflection across Col 6, but it's imperfect.

Hypothesis 2: There are two different rules based on the configuration of Yellow pixels.
*   Rule A (Line of Yellow): If Yellow pixels form a contiguous straight line (horizontal or vertical) that spans the width or height of a non-yellow object associated with it, reflect that object across the yellow line. (Applies to Train 1, Top Object).
*   Rule B (Scattered/Other Yellow): If Yellow pixels are scattered or form a line that doesn't span the object, apply a different rule (cellular automaton? neighbor-based changes?). (Applies to Train 1, Bottom Object and Train 2 Object).

Let's test Rule A on Train 2. Yellow pixels are *almost* a line at Col 6. It spans rows 3-9. The Green object spans rows 1-9. The yellow line Col 6 spans rows 3-9. It doesn't span the full height (rows 1-9) of the object. There's also the extra yellow at (6, 8). So maybe Rule B applies here.

What is Rule B?
*   Train 1 Bottom Changes: R->Y (1), R->W (5), W->R (4). Yellows: (10,10), (11,8), (11,10), (12,11), (13,10).
*   Train 2 Changes: G->Y (1), G->W (3), W->G (8). Yellows: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6).

Look for commonalities. In both cases, one pixel changes from the object's main color (Red/Green) to Yellow.
*   Train 1: R(11, 13) -> Y(4). Input Yellow neighbors: None.
*   Train 2: G(6, 4) -> Y(4). Input Yellow neighbors (Moore): Y(6,5), Y(7,5)=diag?. Rechecking N(6,4): Y(6,5), Y(7,5). Let's use Moore. N={G(5,3), G(5,4), G(5,5), G(6,3), Y(6,5), G(7,3), G(7,4), Y(7,5)}. Neighbors Y(6,5) and Y(7,5). Wait, input has Y at (6,6), (6,8), (7,6). So N(6,4) has only one Y neighbor: Y(6,5) is not a neighbor, Y(7,5) is not a neighbor. Let's list Input neighbors of (6,4): (5,3)G, (5,4)G, (5,5)G, (6,3)G, (6,5)G, (7,3)G, (7,4)G, (7,5)G. Okay, Input(6,4)=G has zero yellow neighbors.
*   My previous neighbor checks were wrong. Let's re-check Train 1, Input(11,13)=R. Neighbors: R(10,12), R(10,13), R(10,14), R(11,12), R(11,14), R(12,12), R(12,13), R(12,14). Zero Yellow neighbors.
*   Hypothesis 3: A Red/Green pixel changes to Yellow if it has zero Yellow neighbors and some other condition is met? Unlikely.

Maybe the Yellow pixels are irrelevant to the R/G -> Y change?
*   Train 1: R(11, 13) -> Y.
*   Train 2: G(6, 4) -> Y.
Is there something special about these locations relative to the shape?
*   (11, 13) is internal to the red shape.
*   (6, 4) is internal to the green shape.

Let's reconsider the simple reflection for the top object in Train 1.
The reflection happens across row 4 (the yellow line).
Input: Rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Output: Rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1 (content copied)
This seems robust.

Now, what if the *same* reflection logic applies to the other cases, but the "axis" is defined differently?
*   Train 1, Bottom: Yellows at (10,10), (11,8), (11,10), (12,11), (13,10). Can these define an axis? Maybe the centroid? Or bounding box center? BBox R9-15, C6-14. Center R=12, Center C=10. If we reflect vertically across row 12?
    *   Row 9 maps to 15. In(9)=[...2 2 0 0 2...] -> Out(15)=[...0 0 0...] (Mismatch)
    *   Row 10 maps to 14. In(10)=[...2 2 2 2 4 2 2 2 0...] -> Out(14)=[...2 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 2 2...] (Mismatch)
    *   Row 11 maps to 13. In(11)=[...2 2 4 2 4 2 2 2 2...] -> Out(13)=[...2 2 2 2 4 2 2 2 2...] (Mismatch)
*   Train 2: Yellows mostly at Col 6, plus (6, 8). BBox R1-9, C2-10. Center R=5, Center C=6. Reflect horizontally across Col 6?
    *   Col 2 maps to 10. In[:,2]=[0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] -> Out[:,10]=[0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,3] (Mismatch)
    *   Col 3 maps to 9. In[:,3]=[0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,3,3] -> Out[:,9]=[0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] (Mismatch)
    *   Col 4 maps to 8. In[:,4]=[0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0] -> Out[:,8]=[0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] (Mismatch)
    *   Col 5 maps to 7. In[:,5]=[0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] -> Out[:,7]=[0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] (Mismatch)

Okay, the simple reflection rule only works for the first object in Train 1. The other two cases must follow a different transformation.

Could the task involve identifying multiple objects and applying different rules based on object properties?
*   Object 1 (T1 Top): Blue 'A'. Property: Has a solid horizontal line of Yellow. Rule: Reflect vertically across the Yellow line.
*   Object 2 (T1 Bottom): Red 'H'. Property: Has scattered Yellow pixels. Rule: ??? (Complex update rule).
*   Object 3 (T2): Green shape. Property: Has a nearly complete vertical line of Yellow plus one outlier. Rule: ??? (Complex update rule - maybe same as for Object 2?).

Let's focus on the complex update rule (Rule B).
Changes involve Color -> Yellow, Color -> White, White -> Color. Yellows are mostly static, except for the Color->Yellow change.

Possibility: Conway's Game of Life rules applied to the main color (Red/Green), possibly influenced by Yellow.
Standard GoL:
*   Live cell with < 2 live neighbors dies (loneliness).
*   Live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives.
*   Live cell with > 3 live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
*   Dead cell with == 3 live neighbors becomes live (reproduction).

Let's test this on Train 1 Bottom (Red=Live, White=Dead), ignoring Yellow for now.
*   Pixels that died (R->W): (9,11), (14,13), (14,14), (15,12), (15,13). Let's check their Red neighbors (Moore).
    *   In(9,11)=R. N_R={R(9,12), R(10,11), R(10,12), R(10,10)=Y}. #R=3. GoL says Live. Output is W. -> GoL fails.
*   Maybe Yellow counts as Live? Or Dead? Or inhibits/catalyzes?
*   If Yellow counts as Live: N_Live for (9,11) = {R(9,12), R(10,11), R(10,12), Y(10,10)}. #Live=4. GoL says Die. Output is W. -> Matches.
    *   In(14,13)=R. N_R={R(14,12), R(14,14), R(13,13), R(15,13), R(13,12), R(13,14)}. #R=6. No Yellow neighbors. GoL says Die. Output is W. -> Matches.
    *   In(14,14)=R. N_R={R(14,13), R(14,15), R(13,14), R(13,13), R(13,15)}. #R=5. No Yellow neighbors. GoL says Die. Output is W. -> Matches.
    *   In(15,12)=R. N_R={R(15,13), R(14,12), R(14,13)}. #R=3. No Yellow neighbors. GoL says Live. Output is W. -> Mismatch.
*   Hypothesis: Game of Life variant where Yellow counts as Live for neighbor counts, but Yellow cells themselves don't change according to GoL rules (they are static or change by other rules). And maybe the thresholds are different.

Let's rethink the R->Y change. R(11,13) -> Y. It had 8 Red neighbors. If Yellows don't count for this rule, maybe 8 neighbors trigger R->Y? No other R had 8 R neighbors.
Let's rethink the G->Y change. G(6,4) -> Y. Input neighbors: G(5,3), G(5,4), G(5,5), G(6,3), G(6,5), G(7,3), G(7,4), G(7,5). 8 Green neighbors.
*   Hypothesis 4: A Red/Green pixel with 8 Red/Green neighbors (i.e., completely surrounded by its own color) turns Yellow.
    *   Check Train 1 Bottom: R(11,13) has 8 R neighbors -> turns Y. Yes. Are there others? Check R(11,11). N={Y(10,10), R(10,11), R(10,12), Y(11,10), R(11,12), R(12,10), R(12,11), R(12,12)}. Not 8 R neighbors. Check R(12,13). N={R(11,12), R(11,13)->Y, R(11,14), R(12,12), R(12,14), R(13,12), R(13,13), R(13,14)}. Not 8 R neighbors. Okay, this rule seems plausible for the R/G -> Y change.

Now, what about the other changes (R/G -> W and W -> R/G)? Let's assume Yellows are static *except* for the surrounded pixel rule above. Can we explain the remaining changes using a GoL-like rule, possibly treating Yellow as walls or just another state?

Try GoL on Red pixels (Train 1 Bottom), treating Yellow as walls (neither live nor dead, don't contribute to counts, block reproduction).
*   R->W: (9,11), (14,13), (14,14), (15,12), (15,13).
    *   In(9,11)=R. N_R={R(9,12), R(10,11), R(10,12)}. #R=3. GoL: Live. Output: W. Fails.
*   Try GoL on Red pixels, treating Yellow as live neighbors.
    *   In(9,11)=R. N_Live={R(9,12), R(10,11), R(10,12), Y(10,10)}. #Live=4. GoL: Die. Output: W. Matches.
    *   In(14,13)=R. N_Live={R(14,12), R(14,14), R(13,13), R(15,13), R(13,12), R(13,14)}. #Live=6. GoL: Die. Output: W. Matches.
    *   In(14,14)=R. N_Live={R(14,13), R(14,15), R(13,14), R(13,13), R(13,15)}. #Live=5. GoL: Die. Output: W. Matches.
    *   In(15,12)=R. N_Live={R(15,13), R(14,12), R(14,13)}. #Live=3. GoL: Live. Output: W. Fails.
    *   In(15,13)=R. N_Live={R(15,12), R(14,13), R(14,14)}. #Live=3. GoL: Live. Output: W. Fails.
*   W->R: (9,13), (10,14), (12,14), (12,15). Let's check their Live (R or Y) neighbors.
    *   In(9,13)=W. N_Live={R(9,12), R(10,13), R(10,12), R(10,14), Y(10,10)}. #Live=5. GoL: Stay Dead. Output: R. Fails.
*   Standard GoL doesn't seem to work directly, even treating Yellows as Live.

Let's reconsider the reflection rule. Could it be reflection across the *axis defined by the yellow pixels*, even if they're scattered?
*   Train 1 Bottom: Yellows: (10,10), (11,8), (11,10), (12,11), (13,10). Center of mass?


*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np
yellow_pixels = [(10,10), (11,8), (11,10), (12,11), (13,10)]
coords = np.array(yellow_pixels)
center = np.mean(coords, axis=0)
print(f'{center=}')
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
center=array([11.4,  9.8])

```
*   Center is (11.4, 9.8). Reflection across row 11.4 or col 9.8? Let's try row 11.5.
    *   Row 11 maps to 12. In(11)=[...2 2 4 2 4 2 2 2 2...] -> Out(12)=[...2 2 2 2 2 4 2 2 2 2 2...] Mismatch.
*   Train 2: Yellows: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6).


*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np
yellow_pixels = [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6)]
coords = np.array(yellow_pixels)
center = np.mean(coords, axis=0)
print(f'{center=}')
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
center=array([6.  , 6.25])

```
*   Center is (6, 6.25). Reflection across row 6 or col 6.25? Let's try col 6.
    *   We already tested reflection across col 6 and it failed.

Maybe the rule is:
1.  Identify separate objects based on color (Blue, Red, Green).
2.  Find Yellow pixels associated with each object (e.g., within bounding box or adjacent).
3.  If Yellow pixels form a solid straight line spanning the object's dimension perpendicular to the line, reflect the object across that line. (Train 1 Top)
4.  Otherwise (scattered yellow, non-spanning line, etc.), apply a different update rule:
    a.  Find any Red/Green pixel completely surrounded by 8 pixels of its own color. Change it to Yellow.
    b.  Apply some other neighbor-based rule for R/G -> W and W -> R/G changes. (This part is still unclear).

Let's re-examine the R/G -> W and W -> R/G changes, assuming rule 4a happened first.
*   Train 1 Bottom (apply rule 4a): R(11,13) becomes Y(4). Now update others. Yellows are now: (10,10), (11,8), (11,10), (12,11), (13,10), *(11,13)*.
    *   R->W: (9,11), (14,13), (14,14), (15,12), (15,13).
    *   W->R: (9,13), (10,14), (12,14), (12,15).
*   Train 2 (apply rule 4a): G(6,4) becomes Y(4). Now update others. Yellows are now: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), *(6,4)*.
    *   G->W: (2,5), (3,2), (3,3).
    *   W->G: (1,2), (1,4), (4,2), (5,2), (6,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,4).

Does the number of Yellow neighbors predict the R/G->W change?
*   Train 1 Post-4a state: Check R pixels that become W.
    *   R(9,11): Neighbors Y(10,10). #Y=1. -> W.
    *   R(14,13): Neighbors Y(13,10)-diag?. No direct Y neighbors. #Y=0. -> W.
    *   R(14,14): Neighbors Y(13,10)-diag?. No direct Y neighbors. #Y=0. -> W.
    *   R(15,12): Neighbors Y(?). No direct Y neighbors. #Y=0. -> W.
    *   R(15,13): Neighbors R(14,13)->W, R(15,12)->W. No direct Y neighbors. #Y=0. -> W.
*   Train 2 Post-4a state: Check G pixels that become W.
    *   G(2,5): Neighbors Y(3,6)-diag. No direct Y neighbors. #Y=0. -> W.
    *   G(3,2): Neighbors Y(?). No direct Y neighbors. #Y=0. -> W.
    *   G(3,3): Neighbors Y(?). No direct Y neighbors. #Y=0. -> W.
*   Hypothesis 4b: R/G pixel with 0 or 1 Yellow neighbors turns White?
    *   Test on R/G pixels that *stay* R/G.
    *   Train 1 Post-4a: R(10,11). Neighbors Y(10,10), Y(11,10). #Y=2. Stays R. Consistent.
    *   Train 1 Post-4a: R(12,10). Neighbors Y(11,10), Y(12,11), Y(13,10). #Y=3. Stays R. Consistent.
    *   Train 1 Post-4a: R(12,12). Neighbors Y(11,13), Y(12,11). #Y=2. Stays R. Consistent.
    *   Train 2 Post-4a: G(1,3). Neighbors Y(?). #Y=0. Stays G. -> Contradiction!

This is complex. Let's simplify.
Maybe the rule only depends on the main color neighbors?
Let's re-examine the Reflection rule (Rule A).
*   Train 1 Top: Blue object, Yellow line at Row 4. Reflect Blue pixels vertically across Row 4.

What if Rule B is also a reflection, but across a different kind of axis?
*   Train 1 Bottom: Red object. Yellow pixels: (10,10), (11,8), (11,10), (12,11), (13,10). Is there *any* symmetry in the output object? Output seems somewhat symmetric w.r.t row 12 or 11.5? No. W.r.t column 10 or 10.5? No. W.r.t diagonal? No.
*   Train 2: Green object. Yellow pixels: mostly Col 6, plus (6,8). Output looks more symmetric w.r.t col 6 than input?
    *   Compare In[:,5] and Out[:,7]? In=[0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,...] Out=[0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,...]. Similar but not identical.
    *   Compare In[:,7] and Out[:,5]? In=[0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,...] Out=[0,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,...]. Different.

Final hypothesis attempt: Focus on the Yellow pixels.
1.  Identify objects (contiguous blocks of non-white colors, ignoring yellow).
2.  Identify yellow pixels associated with each object.
3.  IF the yellow pixels form a single, straight, contiguous line that perfectly aligns with the object's bounding box edge (or middle):
    *   THEN reflect the object across that line. Keep the yellow line itself unchanged.
4.  ELSE (yellow pixels are scattered, form a partial line, or multiple lines/groups):
    *   Find all pixels P of the object's main color (Red/Green/Blue...).
    *   If P is surrounded by 8 neighbors of its own color, change P to Yellow.
    *   Keep all original Yellow pixels unchanged.
    *   For all other pixels (original White, original Red/Green/Blue that didn't turn Yellow):
        *   Count Red/Green/Blue neighbors (N_color) and Yellow neighbors (N_yellow) in the *original* input grid's Moore neighborhood.
        *   A pixel becomes/stays Red/Green/Blue if N_color >= 3 AND N_yellow < 2? (Trying to fit the examples)
        *   A pixel becomes White otherwise?
    *   Let's test this complex Rule 4 on Train 1 Bottom:
        *   R(11,13) -> Y (surrounded by 8 R).
        *   Original Yellows stay Yellow.
        *   Consider R(9,11). N_R=3, N_Y=1. Rule: Stays R (3>=3 and 1<2). Output: W. Fails.
        *   Consider R(15,12). N_R=3, N_Y=0. Rule: Stays R (3>=3 and 0<2). Output: W. Fails.
        *   Consider W(9,13). N_R=3, N_Y=1. Rule: Stays W (not R/G/B). Output: R. Fails.

Maybe the separation into two rules (reflection vs complex) is correct, but the complex rule is different.

What if Yellow pixels *expand* or *move*?
*   Train 1 Top: Yellow line stays.
*   Train 1 Bottom: Y set changes from 5 pixels to 6. R(11,13) becomes Y.
*   Train 2: Y set changes from 8 pixels to 9. G(6,4) becomes Y.
*   The change R/G -> Y seems consistent: happens if a pixel is surrounded by 8 of its own color.

Let's assume this R/G->Y change happens first. Then what?
Maybe the remaining R/G pixels 'flow' towards the Yellow pixels? Or away?
Maybe the Yellow pixels 'copy' themselves onto adjacent R/G pixels under some condition?

Let's assume the simplest explanation that fits Train 1 Top: Reflection across the yellow line.
Maybe Train 1 Bottom and Train 2 are *also* reflections, but we need to correctly identify the axis based on the yellow points.
*   Could the axis be the line of best fit through the yellow points?
*   Train 1 Bottom: Yellows (10,10), (11,8), (11,10), (12,11), (13,10). Almost flat, slightly sloped. Center (11.4, 9.8). Axis maybe row 11/12 or col 10? Reflection doesn't work.
*   Train 2: Yellows (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6). Mostly col 6. Center (6, 6.25). Axis maybe col 6? Reflection doesn't work.

Okay, back to two rules. Rule A (reflection) for T1 Top seems solid. What is Rule B?
Could it be "repair" or "completion" based on local symmetry around Yellow?
*   Look at Train 2. Yellow line at col 6. The shape is asymmetric around it. The output seems slightly *more* symmetric, but not perfectly. E.g., Output[1, 5]=3, Output[1, 7]=3. Output[2, 5]=3, Output[2, 7]=0. Output[3, 5]=3, Output[3, 7]=3.
*   Look at Train 1 Bottom. Scattered Yellows. Output doesn't look obviously symmetric.

Maybe Rule B is about finding the largest solid block of the main color and doing something with it, while noise/smaller bits are removed/added?

Let's stick to the most salient features:
1.  Sometimes reflection across a yellow line.
2.  Sometimes pixels change to Yellow if surrounded by their own color.
3.  Sometimes other pixels change color (R/G <-> W).

Natural Language Program Idea:
1.  Identify distinct objects based on primary color (Blue, Red, Green). Find associated Yellow pixels.
2.  Check if the Yellow pixels for an object form a single, contiguous, straight line (horizontal or vertical) that spans the object's dimension perpendicular to the line.
3.  IF Condition 2 is TRUE: Reflect the object's primary color pixels across the yellow line. Keep yellow pixels unchanged. Write the result to the output grid.
4.  ELSE (Condition 2 is FALSE):
    a.  Copy the input grid to a temporary grid.
    b.  Identify all pixels (P) in the input grid that have the object's primary color AND are surrounded by 8 neighbors of that same color (in the input grid).
    c.  Change these pixels (P) to Yellow in the temporary grid.
    d.  (Need a rule for the other pixels). This part is the hardest. Let's assume for now that *only* the surrounded pixels change. Compare this intermediate state to the output.
        *   Train 1 Bottom Intermediate: Input grid + change R(11,13) to Y. Compare to Output. Differences are the R->W and W->R pixels.
        *   Train 2 Intermediate: Input grid + change G(6,4) to Y. Compare to Output. Differences are the G->W and W->G pixels.
    e.  Hypothesize Rule 4e: Perform a "stabilization" or "cleanup" step. Maybe remove colored pixels with fewer than X colored neighbors? Fill white pixels with Y colored neighbors? This looks like a cellular automaton again.

Given the difficulty in finding Rule B, let's focus the NL program on Rule A and the first part of Rule B.

YAML Facts Structure:
- objects: list of objects found
  - object:
    - id: unique identifier
    - main_color: e.g., blue, red, green
    - pixels: list of coordinates [(r1, c1), ...]
    - bounding_box: [min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col]

    - yellow_line_span_check: boolean (does line span the object dimension?)
- transformation_rule: identified rule ('reflection' or 'complex_update')

NL Program:
1.  Find all connected components of non-white, non-yellow pixels. These are the main objects. Determine their primary color.
2.  For each object, find all yellow pixels within its bounding box or adjacent to it.
3.  Analyze the configuration of these associated yellow pixels.
4.  If the yellow pixels form a single, straight, contiguous line (horizontal or vertical) AND this line's length matches the object's bounding box dimension perpendicular to the line:
    a.  Designate the transformation rule as "reflection".
    b.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
    c.  For each pixel (r, c) of the object's primary color in the input grid:
        i.  Calculate its reflected position (r', c') across the yellow line axis.
        ii. Set the output grid at (r', c') to the object's primary color.
        iii. Set the original position (r, c) in the output grid to white (0), unless it's part of the yellow axis itself.
    d. Keep all yellow pixels from the input grid in the output grid.
5.  Else (yellow pixels are scattered, form a partial line, etc.):
    a.  Designate the transformation rule as "complex_update".
    b.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
    c.  Identify all pixels (P) that have the object's primary color in the input grid AND are surrounded by 8 neighbors of the *same* primary color (in the input grid's Moore neighborhood).
    d.  Change the color of these pixels (P) to Yellow (4) in the output grid.
    e.  ***(Further steps for complex update are needed but undetermined - e.g., Game of Life variant, pixel removal/addition based on neighbor counts including yellow)***. For now, state that other pixels may change based on local neighborhood rules involving primary color and yellow, but the exact rule isn't fully determined from these examples.

This seems like a reasonable summary of the observed patterns and the identified rules/uncertainties.## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming input grids containing colored shapes into output grids. The shapes are composed primarily of one color (Blue, Red, or Green) but also contain embedded or associated Yellow pixels. The background is White.

There appear to be distinct objects in the input grids, characterized by their main color. The transformation applied seems to depend on the configuration of the Yellow pixels associated with each object.

Two main types of transformations are observed:

1.  **Reflection:** In the first example (Train 1, top object), a Blue shape has a solid horizontal line of Yellow pixels running through it. The output shows the Blue part of the shape reflected vertically across this Yellow line. The Yellow line itself remains unchanged.
2.  **Complex Update:** In the other two cases (Train 1 bottom object, Train 2 object), the Yellow pixels are either scattered or form a line that doesn't perfectly span the object's dimension. The transformation here is more complex:
    *   One pixel of the object's primary color (Red or Green) changes to Yellow. This happens specifically to pixels that are completely surrounded (8 neighbors) by pixels of their own color in the input.
    *   Other pixels of the primary color change to White.
    *   Some White pixels change to the primary color.
    *   The original Yellow pixels mostly remain unchanged (except if they were involved in the reflection rule, which isn't the case here).
    *   The exact rules governing the Color<->White changes in this complex update scenario are not immediately obvious but seem dependent on the local neighborhood configuration, potentially involving counts of same-color and Yellow neighbors, akin to a cellular automaton or Game of Life variant.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify connected components ("objects") of pixels with colors other than White (0) and Yellow (4). Determine the primary color for each object.
3.  For each object found:
    a.  Identify all Yellow (4) pixels associated with the object (e.g., within its bounding box or adjacent).
    b.  Check if these associated Yellow pixels form a single, contiguous, straight line (either horizontal or vertical) AND if the length of this line matches the object's bounding box size in the dimension perpendicular to the line.
    c.  **IF** the Yellow pixels form such a spanning line (Rule A - Reflection):
        i.   Iterate through all pixels (r, c) of the object's primary color in the *input* grid.
        ii.  Calculate the reflected coordinates (r', c') across the axis defined by the Yellow line.
        iii. Set the pixel at (r', c') in the *output* grid to the object's primary color.
        iv.  If the original pixel (r, c) is *not* part of the Yellow line itself, set the pixel at (r, c) in the *output* grid to White (0). (Effectively moving the pixel).
        v.   Ensure all original Yellow pixels remain Yellow in the output grid.
    d.  **ELSE** (the Yellow pixels do not form a spanning line - Rule B - Complex Update):
        i.   Identify all pixels (P) in the *input* grid that have the object's primary color AND are surrounded by exactly 8 neighbors of that *same* primary color (using the Moore neighborhood).
        ii.  For each such pixel P, change its color to Yellow (4) in the *output* grid.
        iii. ***(Apply additional rules for other pixel changes - Rule Undetermined)***: Modify the output grid further based on local neighborhood rules involving the primary color and Yellow pixels from the input grid (potentially after step d.ii). This rule likely governs the observed Color<->White transitions, possibly resembling a cellular automaton (like Game of Life) with modified rules considering Yellow pixels (e.g., as static walls or influencing neighbor counts), but the precise conditions are not fully determined from the provided examples. Pixels not affected by step d.ii or the undetermined rules retain their color from the initial copy.
4.  Return the final output grid.
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.ndimage import label, find_objects, generate_binary_structure

"""
Transforms grids containing colored objects based on the configuration of associated yellow pixels (color 4).

Two transformation rules are applied:

1.  Reflection Rule: If the yellow pixels associated with an object (non-white, non-yellow connected component) 
    form a single, contiguous, straight line (horizontal or vertical) that spans the object's dimension 
    perpendicular to the line, the object is reflected across that line. Original object pixels (not on the line) 
    are removed (set to white 0), and yellow pixels remain unchanged.

2.  Complex Update Rule: If the yellow pixels do not meet the criteria for the Reflection Rule, a complex update is applied:
    a. Pixels of the object's primary color that are completely surrounded by 8 neighbors of the *same* color 
       (in the input grid) are changed to yellow (4) in the output grid.
    b. (Undetermined Part) Other changes involving pixels changing between the primary color and white (0) occur,
       likely based on local neighborhood rules involving primary color and yellow pixels. 
       This part is not fully implemented due to undetermined rules. Currently, only step 2a is applied for the complex rule.
