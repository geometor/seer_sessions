task_description: Transforms grids containing colored objects based on the configuration of associated yellow pixels.

examples:
  - id: train_1
    input_summary: Contains two objects: a Blue shape with a horizontal Yellow line, and a Red shape with scattered Yellow points.
    output_summary: The Blue shape is reflected vertically across its Yellow line. The Red shape undergoes complex changes including one Red->Yellow, several Red->White, and several White->Red transformations.
    objects:
      - id: 1
        main_color: blue
        pixels_count: ~30
        associated_yellow_pixels: [(2, 5), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)] # row 4 is a line
        yellow_config: horizontal_line
        yellow_line_span_check: true # Spans the object width at that row
        transformation_rule: reflection
      - id: 2
        main_color: red
        pixels_count: ~50
        associated_yellow_pixels: [(10, 10), (11, 8), (11, 10), (12, 11), (13, 10)]
        yellow_config: scattered
        yellow_line_span_check: false
        transformation_rule: complex_update
        changes:
          - type: color_to_yellow # R(11,13) -> Y(4)
            condition: surrounded_by_8_same_color
          - type: color_to_white # e.g., R(9,11), R(14,13) etc. -> W(0)
            condition: undetermined_neighborhood_rule
          - type: white_to_color # e.g., W(9,13), W(10,14) etc. -> R(2)
            condition: undetermined_neighborhood_rule

  - id: train_2
    input_summary: Contains one Green object with Yellow pixels mostly forming a vertical line but with one outlier and not spanning the full object height.
    output_summary: The Green shape undergoes complex changes including one Green->Yellow, several Green->White, and several White->Green transformations. The original Yellow pixels remain.
    objects:
      - id: 1
        main_color: green
        pixels_count: ~45
        associated_yellow_pixels: [(3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 8), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6)]
        yellow_config: mostly_vertical_line_plus_outlier
        yellow_line_span_check: false # Does not span full height, has outlier
        transformation_rule: complex_update
        changes:
          - type: color_to_yellow # G(6,4) -> Y(4)
            condition: surrounded_by_8_same_color
          - type: color_to_white # e.g., G(2,5), G(3,2) etc. -> W(0)
            condition: undetermined_neighborhood_rule
          - type: white_to_color # e.g., W(1,2), W(1,4) etc. -> G(3)
            condition: undetermined_neighborhood_rule
