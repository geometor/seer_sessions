"""
Transforms grids containing colored objects based on the configuration of associated yellow pixels (color 4).

Two transformation rules are applied:

1.  Reflection Rule: If the yellow pixels associated with an object (non-white, non-yellow connected component) 
    form a single, contiguous, straight line (horizontal or vertical) that spans the object's dimension 
    perpendicular to the line, the object is reflected across that line. Original object pixels (not on the line) 
    are removed (set to white 0), and yellow pixels remain unchanged.

2.  Complex Update Rule: If the yellow pixels do not meet the criteria for the Reflection Rule, a complex update is applied:
    a. Pixels of the object's primary color that are completely surrounded by 8 neighbors of the *same* color 
       (in the input grid) are changed to yellow (4) in the output grid.
    b. (Undetermined Part) Other changes involving pixels changing between the primary color and white (0) occur,
       likely based on local neighborhood rules involving primary color and yellow pixels. 
       This part is not fully implemented due to undetermined rules. Currently, only step 2a is applied for the complex rule.
