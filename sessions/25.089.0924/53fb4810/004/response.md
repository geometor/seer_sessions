## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code successfully solved Example 1 but failed on Example 2. Analysis revealed the core logic for identifying the relevant blue object and the source pixels based on its top row was sound. The primary error lay in generating the output lines.

Example 1 required a single *alternating* color line, corresponding to source pixels located in the *same column* but different rows. Example 2 required multiple *solid* color lines, corresponding to source pixels located in the *same row* but different columns.

The strategy is to refine the Natural Language Program and subsequent code to differentiate between these two cases based on the relative positions of the identified source pixels, and apply the correct line generation logic (alternating or solid) accordingly.

## Metrics

Executing the provided Python code snippet to analyze source pixel locations:
