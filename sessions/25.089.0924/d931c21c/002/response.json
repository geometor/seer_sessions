            "text": "Okay, the metrics confirm the assessment.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial approach correctly identified the core task: finding closed blue loops, filling their interiors green, and bordering their exteriors red. However, the implementation failed on three out of four examples, primarily by missing most of the required red border pixels and occasionally misidentifying interior/exterior areas, leading to incorrect green fills. Example 2 passed because the blue shape was *not* a closed loop, and the correct behavior was to do nothing.\n\nThe key errors revealed by the metrics are:\n*   **Missing Red Pixels:** The vast majority of errors involve failing to place red (2) pixels where they belong (26 missing in Ex1, 30 in Ex3, 10 in Ex4). The code is not correctly identifying all the exterior white pixels adjacent to the loop boundaries.\n*   **Incorrect Green Pixels:** A smaller number of errors involve placing green (3) where it shouldn't be (6 in Ex1, 2 in Ex3, 1 in Ex4). This suggests the identification of \"interior\" regions is sometimes flawed, perhaps capturing small areas that aren't truly enclosed or misclassifying parts of the exterior.\n*   **No Incorrect Red Pixels:** The code never placed red pixels where they didn't belong, indicating the *condition* for placing red (adjacency to blue) was correct, but the *target identification* (finding the *right* adjacent white pixels) was wrong.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe strategy needs refinement in how \"interior\" and \"exterior\" white regions are defined and identified relative to the blue shapes.\n\n1.  **Define Exterior Rigorously:** The \"exterior\" should encompass *all* white (0) pixels reachable from any point on the grid's outer boundary (top, bottom, left, right edges) *without* crossing a blue (1) pixel. A single Flood Fill/BFS starting from all boundary white cells simultaneously will identify this entire connected exterior region.\n2.  **Define Interior:** Any white (0) pixel *not* part of the identified exterior region is, by definition, \"interior\" to *some* blue loop.\n3.  **Process Interior Regions:**\n    *   Find all connected components of these interior white pixels. Each component represents the inside of a closed loop.\n    *   For each interior component:\n        *   Fill all pixels within the component with green (3).\n        *   Identify the set of blue (1) pixels immediately adjacent (orthogonally) to this green-filled region. This is the specific blue loop boundary for this interior region.\n        *   Identify the set of *exterior* white pixels (found in step 1) that are immediately adjacent (orthogonally) to this *specific* blue loop boundary.\n        *   Fill these adjacent *exterior* white pixels with red (2).\n4.  **Handle Non-Loops:** Blue shapes that do not enclose any interior white regions will not trigger steps 3.i, 3.ii, or 3.iii, and will therefore remain unchanged, as will the white space around them (unless that white space is adjacent to a *different*, closed loop).\n\nThis revised strategy ensures that the red border is only applied to white pixels confirmed to be part of the main exterior region and are adjacent to a blue pixel that forms part of a confirmed closed loop. It also correctly handles multiple loops and non-looping shapes.\n\n**Metrics Summary**\n\n| Example | Passed | Pixels Off | Missing Red (2) | Incorrect Red (2) | Missing Green (3) | Incorrect Green (3) | Other Differences |\n| :------ | :----- | :--------- | :-------------- | :---------------- | :---------------- | :------------------ | :---------------- |\n| 1       | False  | 32         | 26              | 0                 | 0                 | 6                   | 0                 |\n| 2       | True   | 0          | 0               | 0                 | 0                 | 0                   | 0                 |\n| 3       | False  | 32         | 30              | 0                 | 0                 | 2                   | 0                 |\n| 4       | False  | 11         | 10              | 0                 | 0                 | 1                   | 0                 |\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Return the final modified output grid.**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code successfully processed Example 2 (no closed loop), but failed on Examples 1, 3, and 4, which contain closed loops. The primary failure mode, confirmed by the metrics, was the insufficient placement of red (2) border pixels on the exterior of the loops. There were also minor errors where green (3) was incorrectly placed, suggesting issues in distinguishing truly enclosed (\"interior\") white areas from the main \"exterior\" white area.\n\nThe strategy needs to more robustly differentiate between the single, connected \"exterior\" white region (reachable from the grid boundary) and potentially multiple, disconnected \"interior\" white regions (enclosed by blue loops). The red border should *only* be applied to pixels belonging to the identified \"exterior\" region that are adjacent to the blue loop boundary.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify Exterior White:** Use a flood fill (BFS) starting from all white pixels on the grid edges to find all connected white pixels reachable from the outside. Mark these as 'exterior'.\n2.  **Identify Interior White Regions:** Find all connected components of white pixels *not* marked as 'exterior'. Each component is an 'interior' region.\n3.  **Process Each Interior Region:**\n    *   Fill the interior region pixels with green (3).\n    *   Identify the blue (1) pixels directly adjacent to this green region; these form the loop's boundary.\n    *   Identify the 'exterior' white pixels (from step 1) directly adjacent to these boundary blue pixels.\n    *   Color these adjacent 'exterior' white pixels red (2).\n4.  Leave non-looping blue shapes and non-adjacent exterior white pixels unchanged.\n\n**Metrics Summary**\n\n| Example | Passed | Pixels Off | Missing Red (2) | Incorrect Red (2) | Missing Green (3) | Incorrect Green (3) | Other Differences |\n| :------ | :----- | :--------- | :-------------- | :---------------- | :---------------- | :------------------ | :---------------- |\n| 1       | False  | 32         | 26              | 0                 | 0                 | 6                   | 0                 |\n| 2       | True   | 0          | 0               | 0                 | 0                 | 0                   | 0                 |\n| 3       | False  | 32         | 30              | 0                 | 0                 | 2                   | 0                 |\n| 4       | False  | 11         | 10              | 0                 | 0                 | 1                   | 0                 |\n\n*Analysis:* The metrics clearly show the algorithm failed to identify the correct exterior white pixels for placing the red border (large number of 'Missing Red').
