These red pixels replace original white (0) pixels. The border seems to be placed on orthogonally adjacent white cells.\n    *   Green (3) pixels fill the area *inside* the blue (1) loop, replacing the original white (0) pixels enclosed by the loop.\n*   The original blue (1) shapes remain unchanged in the output.\n*   Multiple independent blue shapes can exist in one grid (`train_1`, `train_3`), and the transformation rules apply individually to each closed loop.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to find all distinct contiguous groups (shapes) of blue (1) pixels.\n3.  For each identified blue shape:\n    a.  Determine if the shape forms a closed loop. This can be checked by attempting a flood fill starting from a white (0) pixel known to be adjacent to the shape. If the flood fill can reach the boundary of the grid without crossing the blue shape, the shape is not a closed loop enclosing that region. Conversely, if a flood fill initiated *within* an area surrounded by the shape cannot reach the grid boundary, it is an enclosed region, and the shape is a closed loop.\n    b.  If the blue shape is identified as a closed loop:\n        i.  Identify all white (0) pixels enclosed within this loop. Change the color of these pixels in the output grid to green (3).\n        ii. Identify all white (0) pixels in the input grid that are orthogonally adjacent (share a side, not just a corner) to any blue (1) pixel belonging to this closed loop. Change the color of these adjacent white pixels in the output grid to red (2).\n4.  If a blue shape is not a closed loop, make no changes related to it in the output grid (it remains as it was in the input).\n5.  Return the final modified output grid."
