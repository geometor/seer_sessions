            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code successfully identified the core concept: filling enclosed areas (green) and bordering the enclosing loop (red). However, it failed on several examples, indicating inaccuracies in identifying the exact pixels for the red border and potentially misidentifying interior vs. exterior regions or handling multiple loops incorrectly.\n\nThe errors in the `Transformed Output` compared to the `Expected Output` show:\n*   **Example 1:** Significant parts of the red border are missing or misplaced. Some blue pixels seem incorrectly preserved or overwritten. Some green fill is incorrect. The logic for identifying exterior vs interior and applying the border seems flawed, especially with multiple shapes and complex boundaries.\n*   **Example 3:** Similar issues to Example 1, with incorrect red borders and green fills, particularly around the two separate closed loops.\n*   **Example 4:** The red border is incomplete and incorrectly placed. Green fill seems mostly correct, but the interaction with the border placement is wrong.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Refine Region Identification:** The primary issue appears to be distinguishing between the \"exterior\" white region (connected to the grid boundary) and \"interior\" white regions (enclosed by blue loops). The code needs a robust way to identify the single exterior region first.\n2.  **Refine Border Placement:** The red border should *only* be placed on pixels belonging to the *exterior* white region that are orthogonally adjacent to the blue pixels forming the *boundary* of an *interior* region.\n3.  **Process Loops Independently:** Ensure that each identified interior region (and its corresponding blue boundary) is processed independently to apply the green fill and calculate the red border locations correctly, preventing interference between multiple loops.\n\n**Metrics**\n"

This is unexpected based on visual inspection; the expected outputs *seem* to fill the interior correctly. Re-checking the expected output for train_1: there are white pixels (0) *inside* the green fill (3). Ah, the `interior_white_pixels_input` counts *all* white pixels inside, but the green fill might only apply to *some* of them, or perhaps the metric calculation is slightly off if the blue loop itself contains non-white pixels (which it doesn't here). Let's re-examine train_1 output: rows 2, 3, 4, 5 show interior `0`s. This contradicts the initial \"fill *all* interior white\" idea. **Revised Fill Logic:** Green (3) replaces white (0) pixels *inside* the loop, but not *necessarily all* white pixels if there are internal structures (though none exist in these examples). A simpler explanation: My metric counted *all* enclosed white space, but the output *leaves* some `0`s. The rule must be more nuanced. Let's reconsider: The green fill seems to be a flood fill *from* white pixels adjacent *only* to other white/green pixels or the *inner* side of the blue boundary. Wait, look closely at train_1 and train_4 expected output: there are `0`s *inside* the green fill area. This implies the green fill *doesn't* fill the entire topologically enclosed area. It seems to replace white pixels that are orthogonally adjacent to *other* white pixels which are also inside the loop. Or perhaps it's a flood fill from *one* interior white pixel? Let's assume flood fill for now. **Correction:** The metric code correctly identifies the number of input interior white pixels. The *expected output* does not always color all of them green. This is a key refinement. It looks like only the white pixels that can reach *each other* without crossing blue are filled green. If there's an isolated white pixel inside, it stays white? No, that doesn't fit example 4. The `0` inside the green in example 4 is surrounded by green. This `0` was originally blue (`input[3,4] == 0`, `output[3,4] == 0`). This `0` in the expected output of train_4 `output[3,4]` corresponds to an input `0` at `input[3,4]`. Okay, the `0` inside the green is *not* a leftover white pixel, it's a pixel that was *already* 0 and is inside the loop's bounding box but not part of the fillable white area. **Revised Fill Logic (Again):** Find interior white regions. Fill *those regions* green. Any original `0` pixels within the loop's boundary that weren't part of that connected white region remain `0`.\n*   **Red Border:** `red_border_on_exterior` is `True` for all examples. This confirms the red border pixels *are* correctly chosen from the exterior white region in the expected outputs. The issue in the failed code was likely selecting the *wrong* exterior white pixels or an incorrect number of them.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Identify the \"exterior white region\": Perform a flood fill (BFS) starting from all white (0) pixels located on the boundary (edges) of the grid. Mark all reachable white pixels as belonging to the exterior.\n3.  Initialize a list to store \"interior white regions\".\n4.  Initialize a set to keep track of visited interior white pixels to avoid processing the same region multiple times.\n5.  Iterate through each pixel (`r`, `c`) of the grid:\n    a.  If the pixel `(r, c)` is white (0), is *not* marked as exterior, and has *not* been visited yet as part of an interior region:\n        i.  Start a new flood fill (BFS) from `(r, c)` to find a connected \"interior white region\". This fill should only expand to white (0) pixels that are also *not* marked as exterior.\n        ii. Add all coordinates `(ir, ic)` discovered during this fill to a set representing the `current_interior_region`.\n        iii. Mark all pixels in `current_interior_region` as visited.\n        iv. Add `current_interior_region` to the list of interior white regions.\n6.  For each `interior_region` found in the list:\n    a.  Initialize a set `blue_boundary` to store the coordinates of blue pixels bordering this region.\n    b.  Initialize a set `red_border_locations` to store the coordinates of exterior white pixels that will become the red border.\n    c.  For each pixel `(ir, ic)` in the `interior_region`:\n        i.  Change the pixel `(ir, ic)` in the output grid to green (3).\n        ii. Check its orthogonal neighbors `(nr, nc)`: If a neighbor is blue (1), add `(nr, nc)` to the `blue_boundary` set.\n    d.  For each blue pixel `(br, bc)` in the `blue_boundary` set:\n        i.  Check its orthogonal neighbors `(nr, nc)`: If a neighbor `(nr, nc)` is white (0) and *is* marked as belonging to the exterior white region, add `(nr, nc)` to the `red_border_locations` set.\n    e.  For each pixel `(rr, rc)` in the `red_border_locations` set:\n        i.  Change the pixel `(rr, rc)` in the output grid to red (2).\n7.  Return the final modified output grid."
