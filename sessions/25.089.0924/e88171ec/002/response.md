Okay, the code confirms:
- The largest white square is unique: 4x4 at (3, 5).
- There are four 3x3 white squares: at (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), and (4,6). They overlap.

So, Ex1's output seems to correspond to the 3x3 square at (4, 6), applying a rule: N=3 -> Azure size N-1=2, start (r, c).
But why was *this* 3x3 square chosen over the largest 4x4 square?

Possibility: Maybe the rule involves finding *all* white squares, and selecting one based on criteria other than just size?
- Centering?
- Least number of white neighbors?
- Some relation to the non-white pixels?

Let's re-examine the visual aspect.
Ex1:
Input has a biggish white area around (3-6, 5-8).
Output has a 2x2 azure at (4,6). This is one of the four 3x3 white sub-squares. It's the bottom-right one of the four. (r=4, c=6).

Ex2:
Input has 4x4 white at (5,5).
Output has 3x3 azure at (5,5). Corresponds to N=4 (largest), size N-1, start (r,c).

Ex3:
Input has 5x5 white at (10,7).
Output has 4x4 azure at (11,8). Corresponds to N=5 (largest), size N-1, start (r+1,c+1).

It seems Ex1 is the anomaly. Why would it pick a sub-square (3x3 at (4,6)) instead of the main 4x4 square? And why *that* specific 3x3?

Could the rule be:
1. Find the largest white square N at (r,c).
2. If N=4, THEN look for a 3x3 square at (r+1, c+1). If it exists, use *that* 3x3 square (let's call it N'=3, r'=r+1, c'=c+1) as the basis. Apply the rule for N'=3: Azure size N'-1=2, start (r', c') = (r+1, c+1).
   - Test Ex1: N=4 at (3,5). Look for 3x3 at (3+1, 5+1) = (4,6). Yes, it exists. Use N'=3, r'=4, c'=6. Rule for N'=3 -> Azure size=2, start=(r',c')=(4,6). MATCHES Ex1!
3. If N != 4:
   - Azure size = N-1.
   - If N is even: start = (r, c). (Test Ex2: N=4. Falls into case 2 above. Let's modify).
   - If N is odd: start = (r+1, c+1). (Test Ex3: N=5. Azure size=4. Start=(10+1, 7+1)=(11,8). Matches Ex3).

Let's refine the rule structure:
1. Find the unique largest white square. Let N be its size, (r,c) its top-left corner.
2. Define the Azure square size: `azure_N = N - 1`.
3. Define the Azure square top-left corner (azure_r, azure_c):
   a. If N = 4 AND a 3x3 white square exists at (r+1, c+1):
      - `azure_N = 3 - 1 = 2`
      - `azure_r = r + 1`
      - `azure_c = c + 1`
   b. Else if N is odd:
      - `azure_N = N - 1`
      - `azure_r = r + 1`
      - `azure_c = c + 1`
   c. Else (N is even, N != 4, or N=4 but no 3x3 exists at (r+1, c+1)):
      - `azure_N = N - 1`
      - `azure_r = r`
      - `azure_c = c`

Let's test this revised hypothesis:
*   Ex1: Largest N=4 at (3,5). Is N=4? Yes. Does 3x3 white square exist at (3+1, 5+1) = (4,6)? Yes. Apply rule 3a: azure_N = 2, azure_r = 4, azure_c = 6. Fill 2x2 at (4,6). -> Matches Expected Output 1.
*   Ex2: Largest N=4 at (5,5). Is N=4? Yes. Does 3x3 white square exist at (5+1, 5+1) = (6,6)? Let's check input 2. Grid[6:9, 6:9] = `[[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]`. Yes, it exists. Apply rule 3a: azure_N=2, azure_r=6, azure_c=6. Fill 2x2 at (6,6). -> Does NOT Match Expected Output 2 (which is 3x3 at (5,5)). Hypothesis failed.

Where did the check fail for Ex2?
Input 2: grid[6:9, 6:9]
Row 6: `4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 4 4 4 4 4` -> Cols 6-8: `0 0 0`
Row 7: `4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 5 4 4 0 5 4` -> Cols 6-8: `0 0 0`
Row 8: `4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 5 4 4 4 0 4 0 0 5` -> Cols 6-8: `0 0 0`
Yes, the 3x3 at (6,6) is all white. So the rule 3a *should* have applied to Ex2, but the expected output follows rule 3c.

Why the difference between Ex1 and Ex2, both having N=4 and a 3x3 at (r+1, c+1)?
Ex1: N=4 at (3,5). 3x3 exists at (4,6). Output uses (4,6) basis.
Ex2: N=4 at (5,5). 3x3 exists at (6,6). Output uses (5,5) basis.

Is the 3x3 at (r+1, c+1) *fully contained* within the N=4 square?
Ex1: 4x4 is at (3,5) covering rows 3-6, cols 5-8. 3x3 at (4,6) covers rows 4-6, cols 6-8. Yes, fully contained.
Ex2: 4x4 is at (5,5) covering rows 5-8, cols 5-8. 3x3 at (6,6) covers rows 6-8, cols 6-8. Yes, fully contained.

This doesn't differentiate them. What else is different?
Maybe the rule is simpler: the core idea of odd/even placement holds, but Ex1 is just weird?

Let's reconsider the simple rules derived from Ex2 and Ex3, and see if Ex1 can be made to fit.
Rule attempt:
1. Find largest N at (r,c).
2. Size = N-1.
3. If N odd: start=(r+1, c+1).
4. If N even: start=(r, c).

Results:
*   Ex1: N=4 (even) at (3,5). Rule -> size=3, start=(3,5). Code output. Doesn't match expected.
*   Ex2: N=4 (even) at (5,5). Rule -> size=3, start=(5,5). Matches expected.
*   Ex3: N=5 (odd) at (10,7). Rule -> size=4, start=(11,8). Matches expected.

Only Ex1 fails this simpler rule. Why is Ex1 different?
Is the color important? Red(2) in Ex1, Yellow(4) in Ex2, Green(3) in Ex3. Unlikely to be the core logic.

Maybe the "largest" square rule needs refinement. If there are multiple squares of the same maximum size, how to choose? (In Ex1, the 4x4 was unique). If the rule sometimes uses a non-largest square (like the 3x3 in Ex1), when does that happen?

Could it be related to the center?
Grid sizes: Ex1=15x15, Ex2=19x19, Ex3=16x16.
Center approx: Ex1=(7,7), Ex2=(9,9), Ex3=(7.5, 7.5).
Largest square coords: Ex1=(3,5), Ex2=(5,5), Ex3=(10,7).
Distance from center to square corner? Not obvious.

Let's look at the generated azure squares again:
Ex1: Expected 2x2 at (4,6). Derived from 3x3 at (4,6).
Ex2: Expected 3x3 at (5,5). Derived from 4x4 at (5,5).
Ex3: Expected 4x4 at (11,8). Derived from 5x5 at (10,7).

It always seems derived from *some* white square NxN at (r,c).
The azure size is almost always N-1, except Ex1 where it's N-2 (using N=4) or N-1 (using N=3).
The azure start position (ar, ac) varies:
- Ex1: N=3 at (4,6) -> Azure at (4,6). Rule: (ar, ac) = (r, c). Size N-1.
- Ex2: N=4 at (5,5) -> Azure at (5,5). Rule: (ar, ac) = (r, c). Size N-1.
- Ex3: N=5 at (10,7) -> Azure at (11,8). Rule: (ar, ac) = (r+1, c+1). Size N-1.

New Hypothesis:
1. Identify the "target" white square NxN at (r,c). (Still need rule for selection, maybe it's not always largest?)
2. Azure size = N-1.
3. If N is odd (like Ex3): start = (r+1, c+1).
4. If N is even (like Ex2): start = (r, c).
5. If N=3 (like Ex1): start = (r, c).

This combines 4 and 5:
1. Find target white square NxN at (r,c).
2. Azure size = N-1.
3. If N is odd AND N > 3: start = (r+1, c+1).
4. Else (N is even OR N=3): start = (r, c).

Now, how to select the target square?
- Ex2: Target N=4 at (5,5). Largest is N=4 at (5,5). OK.
- Ex3: Target N=5 at (10,7). Largest is N=5 at (10,7). OK.
- Ex1: Target N=3 at (4,6). Largest is N=4 at (3,5). NOT LARGEST.

Why pick the 3x3 at (4,6) in Ex1?
It's one of four 3x3s: (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6). It's the bottom-right one. Is that the rule? If the largest square N is >= 4, find all squares of size N-1 contained within it, and pick the one with the maximum r and maximum c?

Let's test this selection rule:
- Ex1: Largest N=4 at (3,5). N>=4. Find all N-1=3x3 squares within it. These are (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6). Pick max r (4) and max c (6). -> Selects (4,6). Yes. Now apply transformation rule based on selected N'=3 at (r',c')=(4,6). Rule: N'=3 is not (odd AND >3). So start=(r',c')=(4,6). Size=N'-1=2. Fill 2x2 at (4,6). -> MATCHES Ex1.

- Ex2: Largest N=4 at (5,5). N>=4. Find all N-1=3x3 squares within it. These are (5,5), (5,6), (6,5), (6,6). Pick max r (6) and max c (6). -> Selects (6,6). Now apply transformation based on selected N'=3 at (r',c')=(6,6). Rule: N'=3 is not (odd AND >3). So start=(r',c')=(6,6). Size=N'-1=2. Fill 2x2 at (6,6). -> DOES NOT MATCH Ex2 (expects 3x3 at (5,5)). Hypothesis failed again.

Okay, the selection isn't "pick the bottom-right N-1 square".

What if the rule is simply the first one identified: find largest N at (r,c), apply transformation based on N, (r,c)? But this didn't work for Ex1.

Could the code's `_find_largest_square_of_color` be flawed? It searches size down, then row down, then col right. It returns the first one it finds of the largest size.
Ex1: Finds 4x4 at (3,5). Returns N=4, r=3, c=5.
Ex2: Finds 4x4 at (5,5). Returns N=4, r=5, c=5.
Ex3: Finds 5x5 at (10,7). Returns N=5, r=10, c=7.

Let's stick to the simple transformation rule derived from Ex2/Ex3 as it worked for 2/3 cases, and re-examine Ex1's expected output.
Rule: Find largest N at (r,c). Size=N-1. If N odd, start=(r+1, c+1). If N even, start=(r, c).
Applied to Ex1: N=4 at (3,5). Size=3. Start=(3,5). Fill 3x3 at (3,5).
Expected Ex1: Fill 2x2 at (4,6).

Is it possible the "largest" refers to area, and a 3x3 is somehow "larger" than a 4x4 if it's more "central" or "constrained"? No, that violates the definition. Largest means largest side length (or area).

Maybe the color `8` (azure) always forms a square of size `M x M` where `M = max(1, N-1)` if the chosen square is `N x N`? No, Ex1 has N=4 but M=2.

Let's assume the code correctly finds the largest square N at (r,c) in all cases.
The transformation must map (N, r, c) to (azure_N, azure_r, azure_c).
Ex1: (4, 3, 5) -> (2, 4, 6)
Ex2: (4, 5, 5) -> (3, 5, 5)
Ex3: (5, 10, 7) -> (4, 11, 8)

Mapping rules:
azure_N:
- If N=4 and (r,c)=(3,5) [Ex1 specific?], azure_N = 2 (N-2)
- If N=4 and (r,c)=(5,5) [Ex2 specific?], azure_N = 3 (N-1)
- If N=5, azure_N = 4 (N-1)
Looks like azure_N = N-1, except for Ex1 where it's N-2.

azure_r, azure_c:
- If N=4 and (r,c)=(3,5), (ar, ac) = (4, 6) = (r+1, c+1)
- If N=4 and (r,c)=(5,5), (ar, ac) = (5, 5) = (r, c)
- If N=5, (ar, ac) = (11, 8) = (r+1, c+1)

Combining:
- If N=5 (odd): azure_N = N-1, start = (r+1, c+1). [Matches Ex3]
- If N=4 (even):
    - If (r,c) == (3,5)???: azure_N = N-2, start = (r+1, c+1). [Matches Ex1]
    - Else: azure_N = N-1, start = (r, c). [Matches Ex2]

This feels like overfitting to the specific coordinates of Ex1. What feature distinguishes the N=4 square in Ex1 from the N=4 square in Ex2?
- Location? (3,5) vs (5,5)
- Surrounding colors? Ex1=Red, Ex2=Yellow.
- Grid size? 15x15 vs 19x19.

Maybe the rule depends on the parity of the coordinates (r, c) of the largest square?
Ex1: N=4 at (r,c)=(3,5). Both odd. Transform -> size N-2, start (r+1, c+1).
Ex2: N=4 at (r,c)=(5,5). Both odd. Transform -> size N-1, start (r, c).
Ex3: N=5 at (r,c)=(10,7). Even, Odd. Transform -> size N-1, start (r+1, c+1).

This doesn't seem consistent either. Parity of N seems more robust.

Let's reconsider the rule:
- Size is N-1.
- If N is odd -> start (r+1, c+1).
- If N is even -> start (r, c).

This worked for Ex2 and Ex3. Why did Ex1 produce output 2x2 at (4,6)?
Is it possible the target square in Ex1 *is* the 3x3 at (4,6)?
If N=3 (odd), rule -> Size N-1=2. Start (r+1, c+1) = (4+1, 6+1) = (5, 7). Still doesn't match Ex1 output (4, 6).

What if the rule was:
- Size is N-1.
- If N is odd -> start (r, c)? (Ex3: N=5 at (10,7) -> size 4, start (10,7). Fails Ex3)
- If N is even -> start (r+1, c+1)? (Ex2: N=4 at (5,5) -> size 3, start (6,6). Fails Ex2)

Let's try the placement combinations again systematically. Assume size is N-1.
Possibility A: start = (r,c) always. (Fails Ex1, Ex3)
Possibility B: start = (r+1, c) always. (Fails Ex1, Ex2, Ex3)
Possibility C: start = (r, c+1) always. (Fails Ex1, Ex2, Ex3)
Possibility D: start = (r+1, c+1) always. (Fails Ex1, Ex2)
Possibility E: start = (r,c) if N even, (r+1, c+1) if N odd. (Fails Ex1)
Possibility F: start = (r+1,c+1) if N even, (r, c) if N odd. (Fails Ex2, Ex3)

None of these simple placement rules work for all 3 if size is N-1.

What if the size rule for N=4 is N-2, and for N!=4 is N-1?
Rule Attempt:
1. Find largest N at (r,c).
2. If N=4: azure_N = N-2 = 2.
3. Else: azure_N = N-1.
4. Placement:
   - If N is odd: start = (r+1, c+1).
   - If N is even: start = (r, c).

Test:
*   Ex1: N=4 at (3,5). N is even. Size = N-2 = 2. Start = (r,c) = (3,5). Fill 2x2 at (3,5). -> Fails Ex1 (expected 2x2 at (4,6)).
*   Ex2: N=4 at (5,5). N is even. Size = N-2 = 2. Start = (r,c) = (5,5). Fill 2x2 at (5,5). -> Fails Ex2 (expected 3x3 at (5,5)).
*   Ex3: N=5 at (10,7). N is odd. Size = N-1 = 4. Start = (r+1,c+1) = (11,8). Fill 4x4 at (11,8). -> Matches Ex3.

This doesn't work either. The original code's logic (Size N-1, start (r,c) if N even else (r+1, c)) seemed closest, only failing Ex3's column shift and Ex1 completely. The logic (Size N-1, start (r,c) if N even else (r+1, c+1)) worked for Ex2 and Ex3, failing Ex1.

Let's assume the Ex2/Ex3 rule is the general one, and Ex1 is a special case or uses a different target square.
General Rule: Find largest white square N at (r,c). Azure size=N-1. If N is even, start=(r,c). If N is odd, start=(r+1, c+1).
Why Ex1 deviates: Largest is N=4 at (3,5). General rule predicts size=3, start=(3,5). Output is size=2, start=(4,6).
The output corresponds to applying the 'odd' rule (N=3 is odd) to the 3x3 square at (4,6): size=3-1=2, start=(4+1, 6+1)=(5,7)? No.
It corresponds to applying the 'even' rule (N=4 is even?) to the 3x3 square at (4,6): size=3-1=2, start=(4,6)? Yes.

So, Hypothesis:
1. Find the largest white square N at (r,c).
2. **If N=4:** Find the 3x3 white square located at (r+1, c+1). If it exists, this becomes the target square. Let N'=3, r'=r+1, c'=c+1.
3. **Else:** The largest square is the target square. Let N'=N, r'=r, c'=c.
4. Determine Azure properties from the target square (N', r', c'):
   - Azure size = N' - 1.
   - If N' is odd: start = (r'+1, c'+1).
   - If N' is even: start = (r', c').

Test this hypothesis:
*   Ex1: Largest N=4 at (3,5). Is N=4? Yes. Check for 3x3 at (4,6)? Yes, exists. Target becomes N'=3, r'=4, c'=6.
    Apply step 4: Size = N'-1 = 2. Is N'=3 odd? Yes. Start = (r'+1, c'+1) = (4+1, 6+1) = (5,7). Fill 2x2 at (5,7). -> Fails Ex1 (expected 2x2 at (4,6)).

Let's modify step 4 based on previous observations:
4. Determine Azure properties from the target square (N', r', c'):
   - Azure size = N' - 1.
   - If N' is odd: start = (r', c').  (Based on re-evaluating Ex1 N=3 scenario)
   - If N' is even: start = (r', c').  (Based on Ex2 N=4 scenario)
   Basically: Azure size N'-1, start (r', c').

Test this hypothesis (Selection + Simpler Transform):
1. Find the largest white square N at (r,c).
2. **If N=4:** Find the 3x3 white square located at (r+1, c+1). If it exists, this becomes the target square. Let N'=3, r'=r+1, c'=c+1.
3. **Else:** The largest square is the target square. Let N'=N, r'=r, c'=c.
4. Determine Azure properties from the target square (N', r', c'):
   - Azure size = N' - 1.
   - Azure start = (r', c').

Test:
*   Ex1: Largest N=4 at (3,5). N=4? Yes. Check 3x3 at (4,6)? Yes. Target N'=3, r'=4, c'=6.
    Apply step 4: Size = 3-1=2. Start = (4,6). Fill 2x2 at (4,6). -> MATCHES Ex1!
*   Ex2: Largest N=4 at (5,5). N=4? Yes. Check 3x3 at (6,6)? Yes. Target N'=3, r'=6, c'=6.
    Apply step 4: Size = 3-1=2. Start = (6,6). Fill 2x2 at (6,6). -> FAILS Ex2 (expects 3x3 at (5,5)).
*   Ex3: Largest N=5 at (10,7). N=4? No. Target N'=5, r'=10, c'=7.
    Apply step 4: Size = 5-1=4. Start = (10,7). Fill 4x4 at (10,7). -> FAILS Ex3 (expects 4x4 at (11,8)).

This is frustrating. The rules seem inconsistent across examples. Let's step back and list the confirmed transformations:
- Ex1: Input 4x4@ (3,5) -> Output 2x2@ (4,6) [Implies N=3@ (4,6) was target, Size N-1, Start (r,c)]
- Ex2: Input 4x4@ (5,5) -> Output 3x3@ (5,5) [Implies N=4@ (5,5) was target, Size N-1, Start (r,c)]
- Ex3: Input 5x5@ (10,7) -> Output 4x4@ (11,8) [Implies N=5@ (10,7) was target, Size N-1, Start (r+1,c+1)]

Can we unify the selection and transformation?
What if the target selection is always the largest square, N at (r,c)?
Then the transformation rule is:
- If N=4 AND (r,c) = (3,5): Size=N-2, Start=(r+1, c+1).
- If N=4 AND (r,c) = (5,5): Size=N-1, Start=(r, c).
- If N=5: Size=N-1, Start=(r+1, c+1).

This *still* looks like overfitting. There must be a general property.

What if we check the parity of the coordinates of the center of the square?
Ex1: N=4 at (3,5). Center is (4.5, 6.5). Non-integer.
Ex2: N=4 at (5,5). Center is (6.5, 6.5). Non-integer.
Ex3: N=5 at (10,7). Center is (12, 9). Integer coords for center (relative to top-left 0,0).

Hypothesis: Rule depends on parity of N and whether center point has integer coords.
- N is even (non-integer center):
    - Ex1 (N=4, (3,5)): Output 2x2 (N-2) at (r+1, c+1).
    - Ex2 (N=4, (5,5)): Output 3x3 (N-1) at (r, c).
- N is odd (integer center):
    - Ex3 (N=5, (10,7)): Output 4x4 (N-1) at (r+1, c+1).

This looks slightly more general. Let's try to formulate:
1. Find largest white square N at (r,c).
2. If N is odd: [Center has integer coords relative to square top-left]
   - Azure size = N-1.
   - Azure start = (r+1, c+1). (Matches Ex3)
3. If N is even: [Center has half-integer coords relative to square top-left]
   - Check coordinates (r,c):
     - If r is odd and c is odd (like Ex1(3,5), Ex2(5,5)):
         - If ??? : Size=N-2, Start=(r+1,c+1) (Ex1 case)
         - Else ???: Size=N-1, Start=(r,c) (Ex2 case)
     - Else (if r or c is even): ??? (No examples)

This path doesn't seem simpler.

Let's revisit the idea: Base rule works for Ex2, Ex3. Ex1 is special.
Base Rule: Find largest N at (r,c). Size=N-1. If N even start=(r,c). If N odd start=(r+1,c+1).
Why Ex1 is special: N=4 at (3,5). Rule -> 3x3 at (3,5). Output -> 2x2 at (4,6).
The output 2x2 at (4,6) comes from applying the N=EVEN rule (start=(r',c')) to the N=3 square at (4,6) -> size=3-1=2, start=(4,6).
So, Ex1 seems to: Find largest N=4. Identify sub-square N'=3 at (r+1, c+1). Apply transform rule using N'=3, but using the parity rule for N=4 (even -> start=(r',c')).

Hypothesis vNext:
1. Find the unique largest white square N at (r,c).
2. If N=4 AND a 3x3 white square exists at (r+1, c+1):
   - Target is N'=3, r'=r+1, c'=c+1.
   - Azure size = N' - 1 = 2.
   - Azure start = (r', c') = (r+1, c+1). [Uses rule for N=4 (even)? No, uses (r',c') rule]
     Let's retry this. Apply start rule based on N'. N'=3 is odd. Original odd rule: (r'+1, c'+1). New odd rule test: (r',c'). Test with (r',c'). Start=(4,6). Size=2. -> Matches Ex1.
3. Else (not the N=4 special case):
   - Target is N'=N, r'=r, c'=c.
   - Azure size = N' - 1.
   - If N' is odd: Azure start = (r'+1, c'+1).
   - If N' is even: Azure start = (r', c').

Test this refined hypothesis:
*   Ex1: Largest N=4 at (3,5). N=4? Yes. 3x3 exists at (4,6)? Yes. Special case 2 applies. Target N'=3, r'=4, c'=6. Azure size = 2. Azure start = (r',c') = (4,6). -> Matches Ex1.
*   Ex2: Largest N=4 at (5,5). N=4? Yes. 3x3 exists at (6,6)? Yes. Special case 2 applies. Target N'=3, r'=6, c'=6. Azure size = 2. Azure start = (r',c') = (6,6). -> Fails Ex2 (expects 3x3 at (5,5)).

Still stuck on Ex1 vs Ex2. There must be a property distinguishing the N=4 at (3,5) from N=4 at (5,5) that triggers the N-1 selection vs N selection.

Could it be the *number* of N-1 squares inside?
Ex1: N=4. N-1=3. Found four 3x3 squares inside.
Ex2: N=4. N-1=3. Found four 3x3 squares inside. No difference here.

Final attempt at a simple rule, assuming Ex1 output might be misaligned with a general principle:
Rule: Find largest N at (r,c). Azure size = N-1. If N is odd, start=(r+1, c+1). If N is even, start=(r, c).
This worked for Ex2 and Ex3. The coder should implement this, acknowledging it fails Ex1. Maybe Ex1 is flawed, or there's a prior missing. The most consistent rule covers 2/3 examples.**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core task: finding a white square and filling a portion of it with azure. However, the precise rules for selecting the white square, determining the size of the azure square, and placing the azure square were not perfectly captured, leading to failures on some examples.

The provided code implemented a plausible hypothesis based on the first example but failed when tested against the others. Specifically, the failures indicate inconsistencies in how the size and placement of the azure square are determined, particularly when the largest white square has a side length N=4. Example 1 seems anomalous compared to Examples 2 and 3, which follow a more consistent pattern (size N-1, placement based on parity of N).

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Re-evaluate Examples:** Systematically compare the input, expected output, and generated output for *each* example to pinpoint the exact differences and potential patterns missed.
2.  **Metric Gathering:** Use code execution to find *all* white squares of relevant sizes (especially the largest size N and size N-1) and their locations in each input. This will help verify if
