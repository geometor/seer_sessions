Find the maximum side length 'N' of any square block composed entirely of white (0) pixels in the input grid.\n2. Identify the locations (top-left corners 'r', 'c') of all white squares with this maximum side length 'N'. Let the count of such squares be 'count'.\n3. If multiple largest squares exist (count > 1), select the one with the minimum row index 'r', breaking ties with the minimum column index 'c'. This is the 'target_white_square' with location (target_r, target_c). If only one exists, it is the target.\n4. Calculate the side length 'azure_N' for the azure (8) square:\n   - If 'N' is even AND 'count' > 1, then azure_N = N.\n   - Otherwise (N is odd, or N is even and count = 1), azure_N = N - 2.\n5. Calculate the top-left corner (azure_r, azure_c) for the azure square: azure_r = target_r + 1, azure_c = target_c + 1.\n6. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n7.
