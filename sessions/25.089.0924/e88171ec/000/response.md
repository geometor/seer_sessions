Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Similarity:** The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, with only a localized change.
2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and another dominant color (red (2), yellow (4), green (3) respectively in the examples). The change introduces azure (8). Gray (5) appears in example 2 but isn't directly involved in the transformation.
3.  **Key Feature:** In each input grid, there is a prominent square block composed entirely of white (0) pixels.
    *   Example 1: 3x3 white square.
    *   Example 2: 4x4 white square.
    *   Example 3: 5x5 white square.
4.  **Transformation Area:** The modification occurs within this white square block.
5.  **Modification:** A smaller square block within the white square is filled with azure (8) pixels.
    *   Example 1: 3x3 white -> 2x2 azure.
    *   Example 2: 4x4 white -> 3x3 azure.
    *   Example 3: 5x5 white -> 4x4 azure.
    *   The size of the azure square is `(N-1) x (N-1)`, where `N x N` is the size of the white square.
6.  **Placement:** The placement of the azure block within the white block seems to depend on the size `N` of the white block.
    *   If `N` is odd (3, 5), the `(N-1)x(N-1)` azure block starts 1 row below the top-left corner of the white block.
    *   If `N` is even (4), the `(N-1)x(N-1)` azure block starts at the same top-left corner as the white block.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Find the largest square block of white pixels and fill a slightly smaller square within it with azure pixels, adjusting the starting position based on the size of the white square.
elements:
  - object: grid

    description: The largest contiguous square block composed entirely of white (0) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - shape: square
      - size: N x N (variable, e.g., 3x3, 4x4, 5x5)
      - location: variable
      - uniqueness: assumed to be the largest unique square of white pixels per grid
  - object: azure_square
    description: The block of azure (8) pixels replacing part of the white_square in the output.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: square
      - size: (N-1) x (N-1), where N is the side length of the white_square
      - location: derived from the white_square's location and size N
actions:
  - action: find
    actor: system
    target: white_square
    condition: largest square block of white (0) pixels
  - action: determine_properties
    actor: system
    target: white_square
    details: find its top-left corner (r, c) and side length N
  - action: calculate_placement
    actor: system
    target: azure_square
    condition: based on N (side length of white_square)
    details: |
      If N is odd, top-left corner is (r+1, c).
      If N is even, top-left corner is (r, c).
  - action: fill
    actor: system
    target: area within the output grid corresponding to the calculated azure_square location and size
    color: azure (8)
relationships:
  - type: containment
    source: white_square
    target: azure_square (conceptually, the area is within the original white square)
  - type: derivation
    source: white_square (size N, location (r,c))
    target: azure_square (size (N-1)x(N-1), location depends on N's parity)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Candidate Squares:** Scan the input grid to find all contiguous square blocks composed entirely of white (0) pixels.
2.  **Select Target Square:** Determine the largest among these white squares. Let its side length be `N` and its top-left corner coordinates be `(row, col)`. (Assume there is a unique largest white square).
3.  **Calculate Azure Square Properties:**
    *   Determine the side length of the azure square: `azure_N = N - 1`.
    *   Determine the top-left corner `(azure_row, azure_col)` for the azure square based on the parity of `N`:
        *   If `N` is odd, set `azure_row = row + 1` and `azure_col = col`.
        *   If `N` is even, set `azure_row = row` and `azure_col = col`.
4.  **Generate Output Grid:** Create a copy of the input grid.
5.  **Fill Azure Square:** Modify the copied grid by filling the square region of size `azure_N x azure_N` starting at `(azure_row, azure_col)` with azure (8) pixels.
6.  **Return Result:** The modified grid is the output.
