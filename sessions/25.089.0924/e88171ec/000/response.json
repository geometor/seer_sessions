The change introduces azure (8). Gray (5) appears in example 2 but isn't directly involved in the transformation.\n3.  **Key Feature:** In each input grid, there is a prominent square block composed entirely of white (0) pixels.\n    *   Example 1: 3x3 white square.\n    *   Example 2: 4x4 white square.\n    *   Example 3: 5x5 white square.\n4.  **Transformation Area:** The modification occurs within this white square block.\n5.  **Modification:** A smaller square block within the white square is filled with azure (8) pixels.\n    *   Example 1: 3x3 white -> 2x2 azure.\n    *   Example 2: 4x4 white -> 3x3 azure.\n    *   Example 3: 5x5 white -> 4x4 azure.\n    *   The size of the azure square is `(N-1) x (N-1)`, where `N x N` is the size of the white square.\n6.  **Placement:** The placement of the azure block within the white block seems to depend on the size `N` of the white block.\n    *   If `N` is odd (3, 5), the `(N-1)x(N-1)` azure block starts 1 row below the top-left corner of the white block.\n    *   If `N` is even (4), the `(N-1)x(N-1)` azure block starts at the same top-left corner as the white block.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
