**General Assessment**

The previous code correctly identified the core task: finding the largest white square and replacing part of it with an azure square. However, it failed on examples 2 and 3, indicating errors in calculating the *size* and *position* of the azure square, and potentially in handling cases with multiple largest white squares (though this wasn't explicitly tested by the failures).

The errors in the failed code stemmed from an incorrect hypothesis derived primarily from Example 1, specifically the size calculation (`N-2` instead of `N-1`) and the placement logic (incorrect dependency on `count` and a simple `r+1, c+1` offset).

The strategy is to re-analyze the input-output pairs for all three examples, focusing on:
1.  Accurately determining the size (N) and location (r, c) of the largest white square in each input.
2.  Accurately determining the size (azure_N) and location (azure_r, azure_c) of the resulting azure square in each output.
3.  Deriving a consistent rule relating (N, r, c) to (azure_N, azure_r, azure_c) that holds for all examples.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Let's use code execution to confirm the properties of the largest white square for each example.
