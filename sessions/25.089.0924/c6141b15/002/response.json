            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code successfully identified the core concepts of object identification, color mapping, and coordinate transposition. However, it relied on placeholder logic for most shape transformations and placement rules, primarily deriving specific rules only for Maroon (color 9) and partially for Gray (color 5) based on Example 2.\n\nThe test results confirm this:\n*   **Example 1 (Red/Blue):** Failed significantly because the placeholder logic (transposing the original shape and using default placement) does not match the required complex shape changes (Diagonal to Plus, Plus to L/Staircase) and specific placements.\n*   **Example 2 (Maroon/Gray):** Performed much better. The Maroon object transformation (shape and placement `+3,+3`) was correct. The initial Gray placement rule (`-3,-3`) worked for one pixel but not the other. The refined analysis suggests a rule based on the transposed row coordinate (`dr = floor(r_t / 4) - 4`, `dc = -3`) correctly places *both* Gray pixels. The code needs updating with this refined Gray rule.\n*   **Example 3 (Azure/Yellow):** Failed significantly because the placeholder logic doesn't account for the specific shape preservation/transformation (Corner, Line to Scatter) and unique placements required for these colors.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n1.  Update the code with the refined placement rule for Gray (5).\n2.  Acknowledge that specific, complex shape generation logic is needed for Red(2), Blue(1), and Yellow(4). The current `draw_transposed_object` is insufficient.\n3.  Acknowledge that specific placement rules (`T(C_in)`) are needed for Red(2), Blue(1), Yellow(4), and Azure(8). The default `P_out = P_t` is incorrect. The rules derived from Ex 1 examples were inconsistent when assuming placement depends only on color and transposed top-left corner. Further analysis is required to determine the correct placement logic for these colors.\n4.  Update the Facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the known rules (Gray, Maroon) and the requirements for the unknown rules (Red, Blue, Yellow, Azure).\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the results more formally.\n\n"
