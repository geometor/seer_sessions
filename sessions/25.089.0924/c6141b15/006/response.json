            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation mechanism involving object identification, color mapping, coordinate transposition, and color-dependent placement/shape changes. The Python code successfully implemented this logic for Gray (5) and Maroon (9) objects based on Example 2, achieving a perfect match.\n\nHowever, the placeholder rules used for Red (2), Blue (1), Yellow (4), and Azure (8) objects were incorrect, leading to significant errors in Examples 1 and 3. The primary challenge is to determine the precise placement transformations `T(C_in)` and shape generation rules `S_out` for these remaining colors.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Validate Example 2 Rules:** Confirm the rules derived for Gray (5) and Maroon (9) are robust by ensuring they explain the transformations in Example 2 perfectly.\n2.  **Analyze Example 1 (Red/Blue):**\n    *   Map each input Red/Blue object to its corresponding output Blue/Red object.\n    *   For each pair, compare the transposed top-left input coordinate `P_t` with the top-left (or center) of the output object's bounding box `P_out_bbox_tl`. Determine the transformation `P_t -> P_out_bbox_tl`.\n    *   Define functions to generate the required output shapes (Blue Plus, Red L/Staircase) relative to a reference point.\n3.  **Analyze Example 3 (Azure/Yellow):**\n    *   Map input Azure/Yellow objects to output Azure/Yellow objects (this might be one-to-many for Yellow).\n    *   Determine the placement transformation `P_t -> P_out_bbox_tl` for Azure (8) and Yellow (4).\n    *   Define functions/logic to generate the output shapes (repositioned Azure corners, Yellow scattered pattern).\n4.  **Update Facts and Program:** Refine the `placement_map` and `shape_map` in the YAML facts and update the natural language program and corresponding code logic with the newly discovered rules.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\n"
