## General Assessment

The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation mechanism involving object identification, color mapping, coordinate transposition, and color-dependent placement/shape changes. The Python code successfully implemented this logic for Gray (5) and Maroon (9) objects based on Example 2, achieving a perfect match.

However, the placeholder rules used for Red (2), Blue (1), Yellow (4), and Azure (8) objects were incorrect, leading to significant errors in Examples 1 and 3. The primary challenge is to determine the precise placement transformations `T(C_in)` and shape generation rules `S_out` for these remaining colors.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Validate Example 2 Rules:** Confirm the rules derived for Gray (5) and Maroon (9) are robust by ensuring they explain the transformations in Example 2 perfectly.
2.  **Analyze Example 1 (Red/Blue):**
    *   Map each input Red/Blue object to its corresponding output Blue/Red object.
    *   For each pair, compare the transposed top-left input coordinate `P_t` with the top-left (or center) of the output object's bounding box `P_out_bbox_tl`. Determine the transformation `P_t -> P_out_bbox_tl`.
    *   Define functions to generate the required output shapes (Blue Plus, Red L/Staircase) relative to a reference point.
3.  **Analyze Example 3 (Azure/Yellow):**
    *   Map input Azure/Yellow objects to output Azure/Yellow objects (this might be one-to-many for Yellow).
    *   Determine the placement transformation `P_t -> P_out_bbox_tl` for Azure (8) and Yellow (4).
    *   Define functions/logic to generate the output shapes (repositioned Azure corners, Yellow scattered pattern).
4.  **Update Facts and Program:** Refine the `placement_map` and `shape_map` in the YAML facts and update the natural language program and corresponding code logic with the newly discovered rules.
