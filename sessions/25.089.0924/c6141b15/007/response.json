Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (orange, 7).\n2.  Identify all connected objects (groups of same-colored pixels) in the input grid that are not the background color.\n3.  For each `input_object`:\n    a. Determine its color `C_in`, its pixels `pixels_in`, and the top-left corner of its bounding box (`r_min`, `c_min`).\n    b. Map the input color `C_in` to the output color `C_out`: Swap Red(2) and Blue(1); keep other non-background colors (Gray(5), Maroon(9), Azure(8), Yellow(4)) the same.\n    c. Calculate the transposed top-left reference point: `P_t = (c_min, r_min)`. Let `r_t = c_min` and `c_t = r_min`.\n    d. Calculate the output reference point `P_out = (r_out, c_out_ref)` by applying a color-dependent coordinate transformation `T(C_in)` to `P_t`:\n        *   If `C_in` is Maroon (9): `r_out = r_t + 3`, `c_out_ref = c_t + 3`. (Confirmed Ex 2)\n        *   If `C_in` is Gray (5): `r_out = r_t + math.floor(r_t / 4) - 4`, `c_out_ref = c_t - 3`. (Confirmed Ex 2)\n        *   If `C_in` is Red (2), Blue (1), Azure (8), or Yellow (4): Use a placeholder rule `r_out = r_t`, `c_out_ref = c_t`, as the correct placement transformation is unknown.\n    e. Based on `C_in`, determine the output shape `S_out` and draw it relative to `P_out` using `C_out`:\n        *   If `C_in` is Maroon (9): Draw a horizontal line of length 5 starting at `P_out`.\n        *   If `C_in` is Gray (5): Draw a single pixel at `P_out`.\n        *   If `C_in` is Red (2): Draw a 3x3 Blue plus sign centered at `P_out` (Placeholder/Guess).\n        *   If `C_in` is Blue (1), Azure (8), or Yellow (4): Draw the *transposed* version of the original object's pixels relative to `P_out`. (Placeholder - correct shape generation needed, especially for Blue->L/Staircase and Yellow->Scatter).\n4.  Return the completed `output_grid`.\n\"\"\"\n\n# --- Helper Functions ---\n\ndef find_objects(grid, background_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds connected components (objects) of the same non-background color in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n        background_color (int): The color to ignore.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of objects.
