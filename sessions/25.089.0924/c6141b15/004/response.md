## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core components of the transformation: object identification, color mapping, shape transformation, and placement based on transposed coordinates. The implementation successfully solved Example 2 by deducing specific rules for Maroon (9) and Gray (5) objects.

However, the code failed on Examples 1 and 3. This is primarily because placeholder logic was used for the shape transformation and placement rules for the other colors (Red(2), Blue(1), Yellow(4), Azure(8)). The placeholder simply drew the *transposed* original object shape at the *transposed* top-left coordinate, which is incorrect for these cases.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Analyze Failures:** Examine the differences between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` for Examples 1 and 3 in detail.
2.  **Refine Shape Rules:** Determine the specific output shapes generated for Red, Blue, Yellow, and Azure inputs. How are these shapes constructed (e.g., fixed pattern, derived from input)?
3.  **Refine Placement Rules:** Determine the correct offset or transformation `T(C_in)` that maps the transposed reference point `P_t` to the actual output reference point `P_out` for Red, Blue, Yellow, and Azure inputs.
4.  **Update Implementation:** Replace placeholder logic with the refined shape generation and placement rules.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze the failed examples (1 and 3) comparing the expected output to the output generated by the previous code (`Transformed Output`).

**Analysis Findings:**

*   **Example 1 (Red/Blue):** The placeholder (`draw_transposed_object` at `P_t`) places the transposed shapes (Blue Diagonal, Red Pluses) incorrectly. The *expected* shapes (Blue Plus, Red L/Staircase) appear at different locations and are different shapes entirely.
    *   *Placement:* We need a rule `T(2)` and `T(1)` to find the offsets `(dr, dc)` such that `P_out = (r_t + dr, c_t + dc)`.
    *   *Shape:* We need functions to generate a 3x3 Plus shape and the specific L/Staircase shapes seen in the output.
*   **Example 3 (Yellow/Azure):** Again, the placeholder draws transposed shapes (Yellow Horizontal Line, Azure transposed corners) at the wrong locations (`P_t`).
    *   *Placement:* We need rules `T(4)` and `T(8)` for placement. The Azure shapes in the output seem to roughly correspond to the input Azure shapes but are shifted. The Yellow output scatter is completely different from the transposed input line.
    *   *Shape:* For Azure(8), `draw_transposed_object` might be close, but the placement is off. For Yellow(4), the output is a complex scatter, not a transposed line. The transformation seems more involved than just offsetting the transposed shape. It might involve transforming *each pixel* of the input line based on its transposed coordinates to generate the scatter.

**Refined Hypothesis for Yellow(4):**
Maybe each pixel `(r_in, c_in)` from the input Yellow line transforms individually?
Input Yellow line BBox: (3,11)-(12,11). Pixels: `(r, 11)` for `r` in 3..12.
Transposed coordinates: `(11, r)` for `r` in 3..12.
Let's test the Maroon placement rule `P_out = (r_t + 3, c_t + 3)` applied to *each* transposed pixel coordinate `(11, r)`.
`r_out = 11 + 3 = 14`. `c_out = r + 3`.
Pixels generated: `(14, 6), (14, 7), ..., (14, 15)`.
This doesn't match the output scatter (rows 2-10, cols 2-6). The Yellow transformation is not a simple shape mapping with offset.

**Revisiting Overall Structure:** The core idea of processing objects based on color, involving transposition and specific rules, still holds. However, the *implementation* of shape generation and placement needs significant refinement for Red(2), Blue(1), Yellow(4), and Azure(8). The placeholder logic fails.

## Updated Facts


```yaml
# Global grid properties
background_color: 7 # orange
grid_size: variable (16x16, 11x11)

# Object definition
object: contiguous block of non-background pixels

# Core Transformation Steps
1. Identify all input objects (color, shape, pixels, location/bounding_box).
2. For each input object:
   a. Determine input color `C_in`.
   b. Determine output color `C_out` based on `C_in` (see color_map).
   c. Get input object top-left reference point `P_in = (r_min, c_min)`.
   d. Calculate transposed reference point `P_t = (c_min, r_min)`.
   e. Calculate output reference point `P_out` by applying a color-dependent transformation `T(C_in)` to `P_t` (see placement_map).
   f. Generate the output shape `S_out` based on `C_in` (see shape_map).
   g. Draw `S_out` with color `C_out` relative to `P_out` on the output grid.

# Color Mapping (C_in -> C_out)
color_map:
  2: 1  # Red -> Blue
  1: 2  # Blue -> Red
  5: 5  # Gray -> Gray
  9: 9  # Maroon -> Maroon
  8: 8  # Azure -> Azure
  4: 4  # Yellow -> Yellow
  7: 7  # Orange -> Orange (Background)

# Placement Transformation T(C_in) : P_t(r_t, c_t) -> P_out(r_out, c_out)
placement_map:
  9: P_out = (r_t + 3, c_t + 3)       # Maroon (Confirmed Ex 2)
  5: P_out = (r_t + floor(r_t/4) - 4, c_t - 3) # Gray (Confirmed Ex 2)
  2: P_out = ? # Red -> Blue Plus (Needs rule)
  1: P_out = ? # Blue -> Red L/Staircase (Needs rule)
  8: P_out = ? # Azure -> Azure Corner (Needs rule)
  4: P_out = ? # Yellow -> Yellow Scatter (Complex rule, possibly pixel-level, not object-level)

# Shape Mapping (C_in -> S_out generation relative to P_out)
shape_map:
  9: Horizontal Line (length 5) starting at P_out. # Maroon
  5: Single Pixel at P_out. # Gray
  2: 3x3 Plus Sign centered (?) at P_out. # Red -> Blue
  1: L-shape or Staircase relative to P_out. (Specific geometry needed). # Blue -> Red
  8: Corner/Pair shape, likely similar to transposed input shape, drawn relative to P_out. # Azure
  4: Scatter pattern. (Generation rule unclear, possibly pixel-level transformation). # Yellow

# Note: The rules for colors 1, 2, 4, 8 require significant further investigation for both placement and shape generation. The Yellow(4) rule might fundamentally differ (pixel-level transform).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid (`output_grid`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`input_grid`), filled entirely with the background color (orange, 7).
2.  Find all connected groups of pixels (objects) in the `input_grid` that are not the background color.
3.  For each `input_object` found:
    a.  Determine its color `C_in`, its set of pixels `pixels_in`, and the top-left corner of its bounding box (`r_min`, `c_min`).
    b.  Determine the output color `C_out`: Swap Red(2) and Blue(1); keep other non-background colors (Gray(5), Maroon(9), Azure(8), Yellow(4)) the same.
    c.  Calculate the transposed reference point `P_t` by swapping the coordinates of the input top-left corner: `P_t = (c_min, r_min)`. Let `r_t = c_min` and `c_t = r_min`.
    d.  Calculate the output reference point `P_out = (r_out, c_out)` based on the input color `C_in` and the transposed point `P_t`:
        *   If `C_in` is Maroon (9), then `r_out = r_t + 3` and `c_out = c_t + 3`.
        *   If `C_in` is Gray (5), then `r_out = r_t + floor(r_t / 4) - 4` and `c_out = c_t - 3`.
        *   (Rule Needed) If `C_in` is Red (2) or Blue (1) or Azure (8), determine the specific offset `(dr, dc)` and set `r_out = r_t + dr`, `c_out = c_t + dc`.
        *   (Rule Needed) If `C_in` is Yellow (4), the placement might involve a different mechanism, potentially transforming each pixel's coordinates individually.
    e.  Generate the pixels for the output shape `S_out` relative to `P_out`, based on `C_in`:
        *   If `C_in` is Maroon (9), generate pixels for a horizontal line of length 5 starting at `P_out`.
        *   If `C_in` is Gray (5), generate a single pixel at `P_out`.
        *   (Shape Needed) If `C_in` is Red (2), generate the pixels for a 3x3 Blue plus sign positioned relative to `P_out`.
        *   (Shape Needed) If `C_in` is Blue (1), generate the pixels for the corresponding Red L-shape or Staircase positioned relative to `P_out`.
        *   (Shape Needed) If `C_in` is Azure (8), generate the pixels for the Azure corner/pair shape, likely by drawing the transposed original shape relative to `P_out`.
        *   (Shape Needed) If `C_in` is Yellow (4), generate the pixels for the Yellow scatter pattern based on the input line and the (potentially pixel-level) placement rule.
    f.  Draw the generated `S_out` pixels onto the `output_grid` using the `C_out` color, ensuring coordinates are within the grid boundaries.
4.  Return the completed `output_grid`.
