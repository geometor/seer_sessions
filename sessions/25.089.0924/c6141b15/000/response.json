Top-left (2,4). Transposed (4,2). Output Blue Plus is centered at (2,8). Doesn't fit. Center (4.5, 5.5). Transposed (5.5, 4.5). Doesn't fit.\n        *   Blue Plus (L): Bbox (11,6) to (13,8). Top-left (11,6). Transposed (6,11). Output Red L (bottom-left) is centered at (7,2). Doesn't fit. Center (12,7). Transposed (7,12). Output Red L is centered at (7,2). This is interesting! The transposed *center column* (12) matches the output shape's *center row* (7). The transposed *center row* (7) matches the output shape's *center column* (2). This looks like `output_center = (input_center_col, input_center_row)`. Let's check this.\n            *   Red Diagonal: Center approx (4.5, 5.5). Transposed center approx (5.5, 4.5). Output Blue Plus center (2, 8). Doesn't fit.\n            *   Blue Plus (R): Center (12, 13). Transposed center (13, 12). Output Red Staircase center approx (9, 11.5). Doesn't fit exactly, but maybe the \"center\" of the staircase is defined differently? Or maybe the rule isn't transposition of the center?\n\n*   **Let's reconsider Example 2 with transposition of center:**\n    *   Gray 1: Center (5, 5). Transposed (5, 5). Output is at (2, 2). Doesn't fit.\n    *   Gray 2: Center (5, 9). Transposed (9, 5). Output is at (7, 2). Doesn't fit.\n    *   Maroon line: Center (4.5, 2). Transposed (2, 4.5). Output Center (5, 7). Doesn't fit.\n\n*   **Let's reconsider Example 3 with transposition of center:**\n    *   Yellow line: Bbox (3,11) to (12,11). Center (7.5, 11). Transposed (11, 7.5). Output yellow shapes are scattered in columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Doesn't fit.\n    *   Azure corner 1: Pixels (1,1), (1,3). Center (1, 2). Transposed (2, 1). Output azure shapes are far from this. Doesn't fit.\n\n*   **Alternative View:** Could the operation be reflection?\n    *   Example 1: Reflect across vertical axis? No. Horizontal? No. Main diagonal (transpose)? No. Anti-diagonal? No.\n    *   Example 2: Same checks, no simple reflection fits.\n    *   Example 3: Same checks, no simple reflection fits.\n\n*   **Focusing on Example 2 again:**\n    *   Input Gray (5,5) -> Output Gray (2,2). Delta = (-3, -3).\n    *   Input Gray (5,9) -> Output Gray (7,2). Delta = (+2, -7). No consistent translation.\n    *   Input Maroon Line (vertical, col 2, rows 2-7) -> Output Maroon Line (horizontal, row 5, cols 5-9). Rotation by 90 degrees. Length changes from 6 to 5. Position change is complex.\n\n*   **Focusing on Example 3 again:**\n    *   Input Yellow line (vertical, col 11, rows 3-12) -> Output Yellow shapes (scattered, mostly cols 2-6).\n    *   Input Azure corners/pairs -> Output Azure corners/pairs (positions changed).\n    *   This example feels like transposition is involved somehow, given the vertical line becoming horizontal-ish spread and the general swapping of row/column dominance for features. Let's re-run the transpose check, maybe I misread the output comparison.\n\n    *   Checking the `transposed_grid_3` vs `output_grid_3` comparison again. They are definitely not identical.\n    *   However, look at the *locations* of the non-background colors.\n        *   Transposed input has azure (8) at: (1,1), (1,3), (1,9), (1,11), (1,13), (2,2), (2,10), (3,1), (3,3), (3,9), (3,11), (3,13), (5,5), (5,7), (6,6), (7,5), (7,7).\n        *   Output has azure (8) at: (2,10), (2,12), (3,11), (4,10), (4,12), (11,10), (11,12), (12,11), (13,10), (13,12). The locations are very different.\n        *   Transposed input has yellow (4) at: (11,3), (11,4), (11,5), (11,6), (11,7), (11,8), (11,9), (11,10), (11,11), (11,12). (A horizontal line).\n        *   Output has yellow (4) at: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,2), (6,6), (7,2), (7,5), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (10,2). (Scattered shapes).\n\n*   **Conclusion So Far:** Simple transposition, reflection, or translation doesn't explain the transformations. There might be a combination, or a rule based on object properties (color, shape, location) that dictates a specific transformation (change color, change shape, move to new location based on original location/transposed location/etc.). The rules seem inconsistent across examples if we assume the *same* rule applies to all three. However, this is a single task, so there must be *one* rule.\n\n*   **Let's assume the core operation is Transposition.** What else needs to happen?\n    *   Example 1: Transpose. Then, apply shape/color transformation *based on original color*. Red diagonal becomes blue plus. Blue plus becomes red L/staircase. The *location* seems related to the *transposed* location of the *original* object.\n        *   Transposed Red Diag location (rows 2-7, col 7) -> Output Blue plus (rows 1-3, col 8 center).\n        *   Transposed Blue Plus (L) location (rows 6-8, col 12) -> Output Red L (rows 6-8, col 2 center).\n        *   Transposed Blue Plus (R) location (rows 12-14, col 12) -> Output Red Staircase (rows 7-12, col 11/12 center).\n        *   This location mapping is still not clear.\n\n    *   Example 2: Transpose. Then, apply shape/color transformation.\n        *   Transposed Gray pixel at (5,5) -> Output Gray pixel at (2,2).\n        *   Transposed Gray pixel at (9,5) -> Output Gray pixel at (7,2).\n        *   Transposed Maroon line (horizontal, row 2, cols 2-7) -> Output Maroon line (horizontal, row 5, cols 5-9).\n        *   In this case, gray pixels seem to move, while the maroon line stays horizontal but moves and changes length slightly. Transposition seems key, but the subsequent steps differ.\n\n    *   Example 3: Transpose. Then, apply transformations.\n        *   Transposed Azure shapes -> Output Azure shapes (different locations).\n        *   Transposed Yellow line (horizontal, row 11, cols 3-12) -> Output Yellow shapes (scattered, cols 2-6).\n        *   Again, transposition seems involved, but the subsequent change is complex.\n\n*   **Unified Hypothesis Attempt:**\n    1.  **Transpose** the input grid. Let's call this `T_grid`.\n    2.  Create an empty output grid of the same size, filled with the background color.\n    3.  Iterate through the *original* input grid to identify objects.\n    4.  For each object found in the *original* grid:\n        a.  Determine its color (`C_in`) and shape (`S_in`).\n        b.  Determine its location/pixels in the *original* grid.\n        c.  Determine its corresponding location/pixels in the *transposed* grid (`T_grid`). Let's use the bounding box in `T_grid` as the reference area: `T_bbox`.\n        d.  Apply a transformation rule based on `C_in` (and possibly `S_in`):\n            *   **Rule A (from Ex 1):** If `C_in` is Red(2), the output color `C_out` is Blue(1) and output shape `S_out` is a Plus Sign. If `C_in` is Blue(1), `C_out` is Red(2) and `S_out` is an 'L'/Staircase.\n            *   **Rule B (from Ex 2):** If `C_in` is Gray(5), `C_out` is Gray(5) and `S_out` is a single pixel. If `C_in` is Maroon(9), `C_out` is Maroon(9) and `S_out` is a horizontal line (length 5?).\n            *   **Rule C (from Ex 3):** If `C_in` is Azure(8), `C_out` is Azure(8) and `S_out` is a 'corner'/pair. If `C_in` is Yellow(4), `C_out` is Yellow(4) and `S_out` is some complex scatter pattern derived from the original shape.\n        e.  Determine the *placement* of `S_out` with color `C_out` in the final output grid. How is placement determined? It seems related to `T_bbox` but is not simply filling `T_bbox`.\n            *   Ex 1: Red(2) -> Blue(1) Plus. Transposed Diag is (r 2-7, c 7). Output Plus is (r 1-3, c 7-9).\n            *   Ex 1: Blue(1) -> Red(2) L/Staircase. Transposed Plus(L) is (r 6-8, c 12). Output L is (r 6-8, c 1-3). Transposed Plus(R) is (r 12-14, c 12). Output Staircase is (r 7-12, c 10-13).\n            *   Ex 2: Gray(5) -> Gray(5) Pixel. Transposed pixel (5,5). Output pixel (2,2). Transposed pixel (9,5). Output pixel (7,2).\n            *   Ex 2: Maroon(9) -> Maroon(9) Line. Transposed line (r 2, c 2-7). Output line (r 5, c 5-9).\n            *   Ex 3: Yellow(4) -> Yellow(4) Scatter. Transposed line (r 11, c 3-12). Output scatter (various rows, c 2-6).\n\n*   The placement rule is the missing piece. Let's look at the grid *dimensions*. They are different in each example.\n    *   Ex 1: 16x16\n    *   Ex 2: 11x11\n    *   Ex 3: 16x16\n*   Maybe the placement involves coordinates relative to the grid size or center?\n\n*   Let's reconsider Example 2's gray pixels.\n    *   Input (5,5) -> Output (2,2).\n    *   Input (5,9) -> Output (7,2).\n    *   Grid size 11x11. Center approx (5,5).\n    *   If we transpose: Input (5,5) -> Transposed (5,5). Input (5,9) -> Transposed (9,5).\n    *   Mapping: Transposed (5,5) -> Output (2,2). Delta (-3, -3).\n    *   Mapping: Transposed (9,5) -> Output (7,2). Delta (-2, -3). This is close but not identical. What if the delta depends on the original position or transposed position?\n\n*   Let's look at the *background* color. It's Orange (7) in all examples and remains Orange (7).\n*   **Focus on the relationship between Input grid and Transposed grid.**\n    *   Take input grid `I`. Transpose is `I.T`. Output is `O`.\n    *   Is there a pixel-wise function `f` such that `O[r, c] = f(I[c, r], r, c)`? The function `f` might depend on the color `I[c, r]` and potentially the coordinates `r, c` in the output grid.\n    *   Or maybe `O[r, c] = f(I, c, r)` where `f` looks at the pixel `I[c,r]` and possibly its neighbors in `I` to decide the output pixel at `(r,c)`.\n\n*   **Let's revisit the \"Transpose + Color Swap\" idea.** Why did it fail for Ex 1? Let's re-examine the failed comparison.\n    *   Transposed Input 1, with 2->1 and 1->2 swap applied: Let's call this `T_swap_1`.\n    *   Target Output 1: `O_1`.\n    *   Where do they differ?\n        *   `T_swap_1` has blue(1) at (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2). `O_1` has orange(7) there.\n        *   `T_swap_1` has red(2) at (5,13), (6,12), (6,13), (6,14), (7,13). `O_1` has orange(7) there.\n        *   `T_swap_1` has red(2) at (11,7), (12,6), (12,7), (12,8), (13,7). `O_1` has orange(7) there except for (12,7) which is blue(1).\n        *   ... and many other differences where `O_1` has the complex shapes.\n    *   It seems the hypothesis should be:\n        1. Find objects in the input grid `I`.\n        2. For each object, determine its color `C_in`, shape `S_in`, and location `L_in`.\n        3. Determine the transformed color `C_out` based on `C_in` (e.g., 2->1, 1->2 in Ex1; 5->5, 9->9 in Ex2; 8->8, 4->4 in Ex3).\n        4. Determine the transformed shape `S_out` based on `C_in` (e.g., Red Diag -> Blue Plus, Blue Plus -> Red L in Ex1; Gray Pixel -> Gray Pixel, Maroon Line -> Maroon Line in Ex2; Azure Corner -> Azure Corner, Yellow Line -> Yellow Scatter in Ex3). **Crucially, the shape transformation rule seems *dependent* on the input color.**\n        5. Determine the output location `L_out`. This seems related to the *transposed* location of the input object `L_in.T`. The exact relation is tricky (maybe based on center, top-left, etc.).\n        6. Draw the shape `S_out` with color `C_out` at location `L_out` onto a background grid.\n\n*   Let's refine the shape transformations and placement based on **Example 2** because it seems simpler.\n    *   Rule 1: Input Gray Pixel at `(r, c)`. Output Gray Pixel at `(c-3, r-3)`?\n        *   Input (5,5) -> Transposed (5,5). Output (2,2). Formula `(trans_c-3, trans_r-3)`? -> `(5-3, 5-3) = (2,2)`. Matches!\n        *   Input (5,9) -> Transposed (9,5). Output (7,2). Formula `(trans_c-3, trans_r-3)`? -> `(5-3, 9-3) = (2,6)`. Doesn't match output (7,2).\n        *   What if the formula is applied to *original* coords `(c-3, r-3)`?\n            *   Input (5,5) -> `(5-3, 5-3) = (2,2)`. Matches!\n            *   Input (5,9) -> `(9-3, 5-3) = (6,2)`. Output is (7,2). Still off by 1 row. Darn.\n    *   Rule 2: Input Maroon Vertical Line (Col 2, Rows 2-7). Output Maroon Horizontal Line (Row 5, Cols 5-9).\n        *   Transpose the input line -> Horizontal line (Row 2, Cols 2-7).\n        *   How to get from (Row 2, Cols 2-7) to (Row 5, Cols 5-9)? Shift down by 3 rows, shift right by 3 cols?\n        *   Let's try applying `(r+3, c+3)` to the *transposed* coordinates.\n            *   Transposed line pixels are: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7).\n            *   Apply `(r+3, c+3)`: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (5,10).\n            *   The output line is (Row 5, Cols 5-9). This almost matches! It produces a line of length 6, while the output is length 5.\n\n*   **Hypothesis v3: Transpose + Shift**\n    1. Transpose the input grid `I` to get `T`.\n    2. Create an output grid `O` filled with background color.\n    3. For each pixel `(r, c)` in `T` that is not background color:\n        a. Get the color `C = T[r, c]`.\n        b. Calculate the target coordinates `(r_out, c_out) = (r + 3, c + 3)`.\n        c. If `(r_out, c_out)` are within the grid bounds, set `O[r_out, c_out] = C`.\n\n    *   Test on Example 2:\n        *   Transposed Gray at (5,5) -> `(5+3, 5+3) = (8,8)`. Output is (2,2). Fails.\n        *   Transposed Gray at (9,5) -> `(9+3, 5+3) = (12,8)`. Output is (7,2). Fails. (Index 12 is out of bounds anyway).\n        *   Transposed Maroon at (2,2)...(2,7) -> `(2+3, 2+3) = (5,5)`...`(2+3, 7+3) = (5,10)`. Output is (5,5)...(5,9). Fails (length mismatch and out of bounds).\n\n*   **Hypothesis v4: Transpose + Color-Specific Transformation/Placement**\n    *   This seems most plausible. The transformation rules (output shape, color, placement logic) depend on the input object's color.\n    *   The core action seems to involve transposition of coordinates in some way (maybe of the object's reference point, maybe the whole grid conceptually).\n    *   The specific rules for shape/color change and final placement need to be inferred for each color present across the examples.\n\n*   **Let's synthesize rules across examples:**\n    *   Background Orange(7) -> Stays Orange(7), position unchanged (or effectively transposed then transposed back).\n    *   Red(2) -> Blue(1), Shape Diag->Plus, Placement involves transposition + ? (Ex 1)\n    *   Blue(1) -> Red(2), Shape Plus->L/Staircase, Placement involves transposition + ? (Ex 1)\n    *   Gray(5) -> Gray(5), Shape Pixel->Pixel, Placement rule? (Ex 2)\n    *   Maroon(9) -> Maroon(9), Shape VertLine->HorizLine, Placement involves transposition + shift/truncation? (Ex 2)\n    *   Azure(8) -> Azure(8), Shape Corner->Corner, Placement involves transposition + ? (Ex 3)\n    *   Yellow(4) -> Yellow(4), Shape VertLine->Scatter, Placement involves transposition + ? (Ex 3)\n\n*   **Refined View on Placement (Ex 2):**\n    *   Gray(5): Input (5,5) -> Output (2,2). Input (5,9) -> Output (7,2).\n    *   Maroon(9): Input Bbox (2,2)-(7,2). Output Bbox (5,5)-(5,9).\n    *   Maybe the placement is relative to the *transposed* top-left corner of the *input object's bounding box*?\n        *   Gray(5) at (5,5). Bbox (5,5)-(5,5). Transposed top-left (5,5). Output (2,2). Relation? (-3, -3) from transposed top-left.\n        *   Gray(5) at (5,9). Bbox (5,9)-(5,9). Transposed top-left (9,5). Output (7,2). Relation? (-2, -3) from transposed top-left. Inconsistent.\n        *   Maroon(9). Bbox (2,2)-(7,2). Transposed top-left (2,2). Output Bbox top-left (5,5). Relation? (+3, +3) from transposed top-left. Let's assume this `(r+3, c+3)` rule applies to Maroon.\n\n*   **Hypothesis v5: Transpose + Color-Specific Placement Rule relative to Transposed Top-Left**\n    1. Find all non-background objects in the input `I`.\n    2. For each object:\n        a. Get its color `C`, pixels `P_in`, and bounding box `B_in = (r_min, c_min) -> (r_max, c_max)`.\n        b. Determine the transposed top-left coordinate: `(r_t, c_t) = (c_min, r_min)`.\n        c. Determine the output color `C_out` and output shape `S_out` based on `C`.\n        d. Determine the output placement rule based on `C`:\n            *   If C=Gray(5): Output pixel location = `(r_t - ?, c_t - ?)` -- *Rule seems inconsistent for the two gray pixels in Ex 2.* Maybe single pixels are treated differently?\n            *   If C=Maroon(9): Output shape is Horizontal Line length 5. Output top-left = `(r_t + 3, c_t + 3)`. Let's test: `r_t=2, c_t=2`. Output TL = `(2+3, 2+3) = (5,5)`. Output shape is horizontal line length 5 starting at (5,5), i.e., pixels (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). **This matches Example 2's Maroon output perfectly!**\n        e. Apply rules for other colors based on Ex 1 and Ex 3, using the `(transposed_min_col + offset_r, transposed_min_row + offset_c)` logic for placement. Offsets might be color-dependent. The output shape also depends on input color.\n\n*   **Let's re-examine the Gray pixels in Ex 2 with this logic:**\n    *   Gray 1: Input (5,5). Bbox (5,5)-(5,5). `r_min=5, c_min=5`. Transposed TL `(r_t, c_t) = (5,5)`. Output (2,2). Rule: `(r_t - 3, c_t - 3)`.\n    *   Gray 2: Input (5,9). Bbox (5,9)-(5,9). `r_min=5, c_min=9`. Transposed TL `(r_t, c_t) = (9,5)`. Output (7,2). Rule: `(r_t - 2, c_t - 3)`.\n    *   The rule for Gray is still inconsistent. (-3,-3) vs (-2,-3).\n\n*   **Is it possible the offsets depend on the object's position relative to grid center? Or maybe just the coordinate?**\n    *   Pixel 1: `r_t=5, c_t=5`. Output `(r_t-3, c_t-3)`.\n    *   Pixel 2: `r_t=9, c_t=5`. Output `(r_t-2, c_t-3)`.\n    *   The row offset changes (-3 vs -2) when `r_t` changes (5 vs 9). The column offset (-3) is constant as `c_t` is constant (5).\n    *   Rule might be `(r_t - f(r_t), c_t - 3)` where `f(5)=3` and `f(9)=2`. What simple function does this? Maybe related to distance from edge? Grid size 11. `f(r) = max(0, r-6)`? f(5)=0, f(9)=3. No. `f(r) = 8-r`? f(5)=3, f(9)=-1. No. `f(r) = floor(r/2)`? f(5)=2, f(9)=4. No. `f(r) = r % 4 + 1`? f(5)=2, f(9)=2. No.\n\n*   Let's ignore the gray pixels for a moment and assume the Maroon rule (`+3, +3` offset from transposed TL, shape change) is generalizable.\n*   Apply to Example 1:\n    *   Red Diagonal: Bbox (2,4)-(7,7). `r_min=2, c_min=4`. Transposed TL `(r_t, c_t)=(4,2)`. Output shape Blue Plus. Output TL placement `(4+3, 2+3) = (7,5)`. The actual output Blue Plus is at Bbox (1,7)-(3,9), TL=(1,7). Doesn't match.\n*   Apply to Example 3:\n    *   Yellow Line: Bbox (3,11)-(12,11). `r_min=3, c_min=11`. Transposed TL `(r_t, c_t)=(11,3)`. Output shape Yellow Scatter. Output TL placement `(11+3, 3+3) = (14,6)`. Actual output Yellow shapes are clustered around cols 2-6, rows 2-10. Doesn't match.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The simple `+3,+3` offset rule derived from Maroon in Ex 2 doesn't generalize. The transformation is likely more complex, but probably involves finding objects, transposing their coordinates/reference point, changing shape/color based on input color, and placing the new shape based on the transposed coordinates using a non-trivial rule.\n\n*   **Final Hypothesis Structure:**\n    1. Identify connected components (objects) of non-background colors in the input grid.\n    2. For each object:\n        a. Note its color (`C`), shape (`S`), and bounding box (`B_in`).\n        b. Determine the output color (`C_out`) and output shape (`S_out`) based on a mapping dependent on `C`.\n        c. Determine a reference point for the input object (e.g., top-left of `B_in`). Let this be `(r_in, c_in)`.\n        d. Calculate the transposed reference point `(r_t, c_t) = (c_in, r_in)`.\n        e. Calculate the output reference point `(r_out, c_out)` by applying a transformation `T_C` (which depends on the input color `C`) to `(r_t, c_t)`. `T_C` could be a simple offset, or something more complex.\n        f. Draw the output shape `S_out` using color `C_out` relative to the output reference point `(r_out, c_out)` onto the output grid.\n\n*   This structure seems to cover the observations, but the specific mappings (`C -> C_out, S_out`) and transformations (`T_C`) are not fully determined from the examples without more insight, especially the placement rules (`T_C`). The gray pixel inconsistency in Ex 2 is particularly puzzling.\n\n\n## Perception\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid based on the objects present. Objects are contiguous blocks of non-background color. The background color (orange, 7) remains unchanged. The transformation appears to operate on each object independently.\n\nKey observations across examples:\n1.  **Transposition of Coordinates:** The positions of output objects seem related to the transposed positions of the corresponding input objects. A vertical input line becomes horizontal (Ex 2, 3), and the general row/column indices seem swapped in some manner.\n2.  **Color-Dependent Transformation:** The specific transformation applied (change in shape, change in color, placement rule) seems to depend entirely on the *color* of the input object.\n    *   Ex 1: Red -> Blue (shape change diag->plus), Blue -> Red (shape change plus->L/staircase).\n    *   Ex 2: Gray -> Gray (shape pixel->pixel), Maroon -> Maroon (shape vert->horiz line).\n    *   Ex 3: Azure -> Azure (shape corner->corner), Yellow -> Yellow (shape line->scatter).\n3.  **Shape Transformation:** The shape of the object changes based on its input color. Sometimes it's a simple rotation (Maroon line), sometimes a completely different shape (Red diag -> Blue plus), sometimes preservation (Gray pixel, Azure corner), sometimes complex scattering (Yellow line).\n4.  **Placement Rule:** Placing the transformed object (`S_out`) in the output grid seems to involve the transposed coordinates of the input object's reference point (e.g., top-left corner of bounding box), but the exact calculation (e.g., offsets) is complex and potentially color-dependent, possibly inconsistent for single pixels (Ex 2 Gray).\n\nThe core logic seems to be: For each input object, find its color and location. Based on the color, determine the new color, new shape, and the rule to calculate the new location using the transposed coordinates of the original location. Draw the new shape with the new color at the calculated new location.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
