The core operation appears to be a horizontal \"spread\" or \"infection\" effect originating from azure pixels. The overall structure and most pixels of the grid remain unchanged; only pixels adjacent horizontally to azure pixels are potentially modified. The colors targeted for change are red (2) and blue (1). If a red or blue pixel is directly to the left or right of an azure pixel in the input grid, it becomes azure in the output grid. All other pixels, including the original azure pixels, retain their initial color. The transformation rule is applied simultaneously based on the state of the input grid.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
