The color of this new background is taken from the *other* half of the input.\n6.  **Selection Logic:** The half whose foreground objects are preserved seems to be the one containing more \"significant\" or numerous foreground pixels compared to the other half. The background color of the *less* significant half (in terms of foreground content) becomes the background of the output.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

If H > W, split horizontally (Top half, Bottom half). Otherwise (W >= H), split vertically (Left half, Right half).\n3.  For each half, determine its background color by finding the most frequent color within that half.\n4.  For each half, count the number of pixels that are *not* its background color (these are the foreground pixels).\n5.  Identify the \"source half\" as the half with the greater number of foreground pixels. The other half is the \"target half\".\n6.  Note the background color of the source half (`bg_source`) and the background color of the target half (`bg_target`).\n7.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as one of the halves.\n8.  Fill the entire output grid with the `bg_target` color.\n9.  Iterate through each pixel in the source half of the input grid. If a pixel's color is different from `bg_source`, copy that pixel's color to the same relative position within the output grid, overwriting the `bg_target` color at that position.\n10. The final output grid is the result."
