"""
Transforms an input grid by performing the following steps:
1. Splits the input grid into two halves (vertically if Width >= Height, horizontally otherwise).
2. Identifies the background color (most frequent color) for each half.
3. Counts the number of non-background (foreground) pixels in each half.
4. Determines the "pattern source" half (the one with more foreground pixels; ties go to the first half - Top/Left)
   and the "target canvas" half (the one with fewer or equal foreground pixels).
5. Creates an output grid with the dimensions of the target canvas half.
6. Fills the output grid with the background color of the target canvas half.
7. Overlays the foreground pixels from the pattern source half onto the output grid,
   maintaining their relative positions.
