            "text": "Okay, the initial code failed on all examples, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of the transformation rule or a flaw in its implementation. The core concept of splitting the grid, identifying foreground/background, and combining elements seems correct, but the specific rules for *which* elements are combined and *how* need refinement.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Misinterpretation:** The previous code assumed the output grid derived its *shape* from the \"source\" half (more foreground pixels). The failed results strongly suggest the output grid actually takes its shape and background color from the \"target\" half (the one with *fewer* foreground pixels).\n2.  **Foreground Source:** The foreground pixels still appear to come from the \"source\" half (the one with *more* foreground pixels).\n3.  **Overlay Mechanism:** The foreground pixels from the source half need to be placed onto the target canvas (target shape + target background) while preserving their relative coordinates *within the source half*.\n4.  **Strategy:**\n    *   Verify the foreground pixel counts for each half in each example using code execution.\n    *   Confirm the split direction (horizontal/vertical).\n    *   Confirm the background colors.\n    *   Validate the hypothesis: Output = Target Shape + Target Background + Source Foreground Pixels.\n    *   Update the YAML and Natural Language Program to reflect this corrected understanding.\n\n**Gathering Metrics via Code Execution:**\n"
