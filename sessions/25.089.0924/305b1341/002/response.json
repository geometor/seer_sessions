            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code failed because it misinterpreted how the output rectangles are defined and how multiple patterns interact. Key issues identified:\n\n1.  **Bounding Box Definition:** The output rectangles are not necessarily the minimal bounding boxes of the pattern pixels themselves, nor are they simple padded versions. The exact definition needs refinement based on observed outputs. However, the minimal bounding box of the *pattern pixels* seems a reasonable starting point for the *area to be filled*, even if the final output shows larger visual rectangles due to fills. The core logic error might be in how fills interact rather than the box definition itself.\n2.  **Key Area Handling:** The key pairs in the input's top-left corner must be excluded from the pattern detection and transformation process. They serve only as a legend.\n3.  **Overlap/Precedence:** When multiple pattern bounding boxes potentially overlap, the examples suggest a precedence rule is needed. The analysis of Example 1 indicates that the order of key pairs listed in the input might determine which pattern's fill takes precedence in overlapping regions (later keys' fills overwrite earlier ones).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Refine the `find_key_pairs` function to accurately identify the key region, return keys in their original order, and exclude this region from subsequent steps.\n2.  Refine `find_pattern_pixels` to search only outside the identified key region.\n3.  Implement the transformation by iterating through the key pairs *in the order they were found*. For each key `(P, K)`, calculate the minimal bounding box of pattern color `P`'s pixels (outside the key area). Fill this bounding box in the output grid using the checkerboard rule (`P`->`P`, `0`->`K`), allowing later fills to overwrite earlier ones in case of overlap.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
