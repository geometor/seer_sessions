These pairs appear unique in each example and seem to act as a legend or key.\n    *   The rest of the grid often contains vertical columns characterized by a repeating pattern of a single color alternating with white (`C 0 C 0 ...`). These pattern columns are separated by columns of all white pixels. Different pattern colors can exist in the same input grid.\n\n2.  **Output Structure:**\n    *   The output grids consist of rectangular blocks filled with checkerboard patterns.\n    *   Each checkerboard pattern uses two colors.\n    *   The locations and colors of these checkerboard rectangles correspond to the locations and colors of the pattern columns in the input.\n\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The key pairs in the input's top-left define the two colors used for the checkerboard fill in the output. If a key pair is `(C1, C2)`, it seems to relate to input pattern columns of color `C1`. The corresponding output rectangle uses `C1` and `C2` for its checkerboard.\n    *   For each distinct pattern color `C1` found in the input columns:\n        *   Locate the corresponding key pair `(C1, C2)` in the top-left.\n        *   Identify all columns containing the pattern color `C1`.\n        *   Determine the bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column) that encloses all instances of `C1` within its pattern columns.\n        *   In the output grid, fill this bounding box area. Cells within the bounding box that corresponded to `C1` in the input are filled with `C1` (which is `F2` in the logic below). Cells that corresponded to white (`0`) in the input are filled with `C2` (which is `F1` in the logic below).\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Scan the top-left corner of the input grid (e.g., first 3 rows, first 2 columns) to identify all pairs of adjacent non-white pixels `(C1, C2)`. Store these as a mapping where the first color `C1` maps to the second color `C2`. Let's call this the `key_map`.\n3.  Identify all unique non-white colors present in the input grid *outside* the key pair region. These are the pattern colors.\n4.  For each unique pattern color `P` identified in step 3:\n    a.  Check if `P` exists as a first color (`C1`) in the `key_map`. If not, skip this pattern color. Let the corresponding second color from the map be `K` (so `K = key_map[P]`).\n    b.  Find all cell coordinates `(r, c)` in the input grid where the pixel value is `P`.\n    c.  Determine the minimum and maximum row indices (`min_r`, `max_r`) and minimum and maximum column indices (`min_c`, `max_c`) from the coordinates found in step 4b. This defines the bounding box for pattern `P`.\n    d.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` within this bounding box (from `min_r` to `max_r`, and `min_c` to `max_c`).\n    e.  For each cell `(r, c)` inside the bounding box:\n        i.  If the input grid at `input[r][c]` has the color `P`, set the output grid at `output[r][c]` to `P`.\n        ii. If the input grid at `input[r][c]` has the background color (white, 0), set the output grid at `output[r][c]` to `K` (the corresponding second color from the key pair).\n5.  Return the completed output grid."
