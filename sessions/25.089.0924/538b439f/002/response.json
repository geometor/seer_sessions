            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism as reflection across a central axis, with behavior dependent on the axis type and object colors. However, the implementation details for specific cases were inaccurate, leading to failures in both training examples.\n\n*   **Example 1 Failure:** The error occurred in the \"fill\" step after reflecting Azure (8) objects. The fill color (Blue 1) incorrectly overwrote parts of the reflected Azure object. This suggests the order of operations (reflect vs. fill) or the boundary calculation for the fill was wrong. The fix involves ensuring the reflection happens first and the fill respects the boundaries of both the original and reflected objects.\n*   **Example 2 Failure:** The reflection of Green (3) objects was mostly correct, but the conditional reflection of Blue (1) pixels (changing the destination to Red 2 under certain conditions) was significantly flawed. The initial hypothesis (change if destination is background) was insufficient. Further analysis revealed a more complex condition: the change only occurs if the *source* Blue (1) pixel is isolated (has no adjacent Blue neighbors) AND the destination pixel in the input grid is the background color.\n\n**Strategy**\n\n1.  Modify the `transform` function for Case 1 (Vertical Blue Axis) to perform the Azure (8) reflection *before* the Blue (1) fill, and ensure the fill range does not overlap the reflected Azure pixels.\n2.  Modify the `transform` function for Case 2 (Horizontal Red Axis) to include the adjacency check for source Blue (1) pixels when determining whether to change the reflected destination pixel to Red (2).\n3.  Re-run the tests to verify the corrected logic.\n4.  Generate updated metrics, YAML facts, and the natural language program based on the revised understanding.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
