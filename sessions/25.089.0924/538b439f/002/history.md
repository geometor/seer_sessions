Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Axis of Symmetry:** Both examples feature a prominent line that acts as an axis of symmetry.
    *   In `train_1`, it's a vertical Blue (1) line in the center (column 9).
    *   In `train_2`, it's a horizontal Red (2) line in the center (row 8).
2.  **Background Color:** There's a dominant background color in each example, distinct from the axis color.
    *   `train_1`: Red (2) is the background.
    *   `train_2`: Azure (8) is the background.
3.  **Object Colors & Shapes:** Various other colors appear, forming distinct shapes or scattered pixels ('objects').
    *   `train_1`: Azure (8) shapes and scattered Yellow (4) pixels appear on a Red (2) background, split by a Blue (1) axis.
    *   `train_2`: Blue (1) scattered pixels and Green (3) shapes appear on an Azure (8) background, split by a Red (2) axis.
4.  **Transformation Logic - Reflection:** The core transformation seems to involve reflection across the identified axis. However, the *effect* of reflection depends on the color of the object being reflected.
5.  **Reflection Effects:**
    *   **Direct Copy/Replacement:** In `train_1`, Azure (8) shapes on the left are reflected to the right, creating copies of themselves. In `train_2`, Green (3) shapes below the axis are reflected above, creating copies. The reflected copy overwrites whatever was previously at the destination coordinates.
    *   **Conditional Background Change:** In `train_2`, Blue (1) pixels above the axis are reflected below. If the destination cell in the *input* contains the background color (Azure 8), it's changed to Red (2) in the *output*. Otherwise (if the destination was already Blue, Green, or the Red axis), it remains unchanged.
    *   **Area Filling:** In `train_1`, after reflecting the Azure (8) shapes, the space *between* the original shape and its reflection is filled with Blue (1), but only on the rows occupied by the shape, and excluding the axis column itself.
    *   **Inert Objects:** In `train_1`, the Yellow (4) pixels seem unaffected by the reflection process; they remain in their original positions in the output.
6.  **Source Side:** The reflection seems unidirectional for each type of interaction.
    *   `train_1`: Reflection happens from left to right (Azure shapes on the left cause changes on the right).
    *   `train_2`: Green shapes reflect from bottom to top. Blue pixels reflect from top to bottom.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Reflect objects across a central axis, with effects depending on the object's color.

grid_properties:
  axis:
    present: true
    orientation: Varies (Vertical in train_1, Horizontal in train_2)
    color: Varies (Blue 1 in train_1, Red 2 in train_2)
    location: Central column or row dividing the grid.
  background_color: Varies (Red 2 in train_1, Azure 8 in train_2) - Most frequent color excluding the axis.

object_interactions:
  - type: primary_reflection_copy
    object_color: Azure (8) # As seen in train_1
    source_side: Left # Relative to vertical axis
    action:
      - Reflect object pixels across the axis.
      - Overwrite destination cells with the object_color (Azure 8).

  - type: primary_reflection_copy # Added based on train_2 observation
    object_color: Green (3) # As seen in train_2
    source_side: Bottom # Relative to horizontal axis
    action:
      - Reflect object pixels across the axis.
      - Overwrite destination cells with the object_color (Green 3).

  - type: fill_between_reflection
    trigger_object_color: Azure (8) # As seen in train_1
    fill_color: Blue (1)
    action:
      - After primary_reflection_copy for Azure (8) objects.
      - For each row occupied by an original Azure (8) object:
        - Identify the column range of the original object in that row.
        - Identify the column range of the reflected object in that row.
        - Fill cells between the original object's right edge and the axis with fill_color (Blue 1).
        - Fill cells between the axis and the reflected object's left edge with fill_color (Blue 1).
      - Condition: Do not overwrite axis or object pixels.

  - type: secondary_reflection_conditional_background_change
    object_color: Blue (1) # As seen in train_2
    source_side: Top # Relative to horizontal axis
    target_background_color: Azure (8) # Background on the destination side
    output_color: Red (2)
    action:
      - Reflect object pixels across the axis.
      - Check the color of the destination cell in the *input* grid.
      - If the destination cell color matches target_background_color (Azure 8), change the cell in the *output* grid to output_color (Red 2).
      - Otherwise, leave the destination cell in the output grid unchanged.

  - type: inert_object
    object_color: Yellow (4) # As seen in train_1
    action: No change. Object remains in its original position.

general_behavior:
  - The axis itself remains unchanged.
  - Pixels not involved in reflection or filling remain unchanged unless overwritten by a reflection copy.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Identify the axis of symmetry: Find the single row or column that consists of only one color and spans the entire width or height of the grid. Record its orientation (horizontal/vertical), index (row/column number), and color.
3.  Identify the background color: Determine the most frequent color in the input grid, excluding the axis color.
4.  Identify all unique colors present besides the axis and background colors. These are potential object colors.
5.  *Infer interaction types based on examples (
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

"""
This program transforms an input grid based on reflection rules across a central axis.
The specific reflection behavior depends on the orientation and color of the axis,
the background color, and the color of the object being reflected.

Based on the training examples:

Case 1 (Vertical Blue Axis, Red Background - like train_1):
1. Find the vertical axis (Blue, color 1) and background color (Red, color 2).
2. Identify Azure objects (color 8) located to the left of the axis.
3. Reflect these Azure objects across the axis, copying the Azure color to the destination.
4. For each row containing part of an original left-side Azure object, fill the space between the original object's rightmost pixel and the axis with Blue (1).
5. Similarly, fill the space between the axis and the reflected object's leftmost pixel with Blue (1) on those same rows.
6. Other colors (like Yellow, color 4) remain unchanged.

Case 2 (Horizontal Red Axis, Azure Background - like train_2):
1. Find the horizontal axis (Red, color 2) and background color (Azure, color 8).
2. Identify Green objects (color 3) located below the axis.
3. Reflect these Green objects across the axis, copying the Green color to the destination.
4. Identify Blue pixels (color 1) located above the axis.
5. Reflect these Blue pixels across the axis.
6. For each reflected Blue pixel, check the color of the corresponding destination cell in the *original input grid*.
7. If the original destination cell was the background color (Azure, 8), change the cell in the *output grid* to Red (2). Otherwise, the destination cell keeps its value (which might have been changed by the Green reflection if they overlap, or its original value).
