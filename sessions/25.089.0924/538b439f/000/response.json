            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Axis of Symmetry:** Both examples feature a prominent line that acts as an axis of symmetry.\n    *   In `train_1`, it's a vertical Blue (1) line in the center (column 9).\n    *   In `train_2`, it's a horizontal Red (2) line in the center (row 8).\n2.  **Background Color:** There's a dominant background color in each example, distinct from the axis color.\n    *   `train_1`: Red (2) is the background.\n    *   `train_2`: Azure (8) is the background.\n3.  **Object Colors & Shapes:** Various other colors appear, forming distinct shapes or scattered pixels ('objects').\n    *   `train_1`: Azure (8) shapes and scattered Yellow (4) pixels appear on a Red (2) background, split by a Blue (1) axis.\n    *   `train_2`: Blue (1) scattered pixels and Green (3) shapes appear on an Azure (8) background, split by a Red (2) axis.\n4.  **Transformation Logic - Reflection:** The core transformation seems to involve reflection across the identified axis. However, the *effect* of reflection depends on the color of the object being reflected.\n5.  **Reflection Effects:**\n    *   **Direct Copy/Replacement:** In `train_1`, Azure (8) shapes on the left are reflected to the right, creating copies of themselves. In `train_2`, Green (3) shapes below the axis are reflected above, creating copies. The reflected copy overwrites whatever was previously at the destination coordinates.\n    *   **Conditional Background Change:** In `train_2`, Blue (1) pixels above the axis are reflected below. If the destination cell in the *input* contains the background color (Azure 8), it's changed to Red (2) in the *output*. Otherwise (if the destination was already Blue, Green, or the Red axis), it remains unchanged.\n    *   **Area Filling:** In `train_1`, after reflecting the Azure (8) shapes, the space *between* the original shape and its reflection is filled with Blue (1), but only on the rows occupied by the shape, and excluding the axis column itself.\n    *   **Inert Objects:** In `train_1`, the Yellow (4) pixels seem unaffected by the reflection process; they remain in their original positions in the output.\n6.  **Source Side:** The reflection seems unidirectional for each type of interaction.\n    *   `train_1`: Reflection happens from left to right (Azure shapes on the left cause changes on the right).\n    *   `train_2`: Green shapes reflect from bottom to top. Blue pixels reflect from top to bottom.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
