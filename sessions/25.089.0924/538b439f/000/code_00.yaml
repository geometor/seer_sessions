task_description: Reflect objects across a central axis, with effects depending on the object's color.

grid_properties:
  axis:
    present: true
    orientation: Varies (Vertical in train_1, Horizontal in train_2)
    color: Varies (Blue 1 in train_1, Red 2 in train_2)
    location: Central column or row dividing the grid.
  background_color: Varies (Red 2 in train_1, Azure 8 in train_2) - Most frequent color excluding the axis.

object_interactions:
  - type: primary_reflection_copy
    object_color: Azure (8) # As seen in train_1
    source_side: Left # Relative to vertical axis
    action:
      - Reflect object pixels across the axis.
      - Overwrite destination cells with the object_color (Azure 8).

  - type: primary_reflection_copy # Added based on train_2 observation
    object_color: Green (3) # As seen in train_2
    source_side: Bottom # Relative to horizontal axis
    action:
      - Reflect object pixels across the axis.
      - Overwrite destination cells with the object_color (Green 3).

  - type: fill_between_reflection
    trigger_object_color: Azure (8) # As seen in train_1
    fill_color: Blue (1)
    action:
      - After primary_reflection_copy for Azure (8) objects.
      - For each row occupied by an original Azure (8) object:
        - Identify the column range of the original object in that row.
        - Identify the column range of the reflected object in that row.
        - Fill cells between the original object's right edge and the axis with fill_color (Blue 1).
        - Fill cells between the axis and the reflected object's left edge with fill_color (Blue 1).
      - Condition: Do not overwrite axis or object pixels.

  - type: secondary_reflection_conditional_background_change
    object_color: Blue (1) # As seen in train_2
    source_side: Top # Relative to horizontal axis
    target_background_color: Azure (8) # Background on the destination side
    output_color: Red (2)
    action:
      - Reflect object pixels across the axis.
      - Check the color of the destination cell in the *input* grid.
      - If the destination cell color matches target_background_color (Azure 8), change the cell in the *output* grid to output_color (Red 2).
      - Otherwise, leave the destination cell in the output grid unchanged.

  - type: inert_object
    object_color: Yellow (4) # As seen in train_1
    action: No change. Object remains in its original position.

general_behavior:
  - The axis itself remains unchanged.
  - Pixels not involved in reflection or filling remain unchanged unless overwritten by a reflection copy.
