Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the background color (the most frequent color in the grid).
2. Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
3. If a pixel's color is neither white (0) nor the background color (let's call this a 'trigger pixel'), check if it is cardinally adjacent (up, down, left, right) to at least one white pixel.
4. If a trigger pixel is adjacent to a white pixel, then find all of its cardinal neighbors that have the background color.
5. Change the color of these background-colored neighbors in the output grid to match the color of the trigger pixel.
6. Pixels that are not modified retain their original color from the input grid.
