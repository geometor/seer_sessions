elements:
  - role: background
    property: most frequent color in the grid
    persistence: remains constant except where overwritten by 2x2 blocks
  - role: white_region
    property: contiguous area of white (0) pixels
    persistence: shape and location preserved, used for spatial reference
  - role: bounding_box
    property: minimal rectangle enclosing a white_region
    relevance: used to define corner locations
  - role: corner_pixel
    property: background pixel diagonally adjacent to a corner of a white_region's bounding_box
    location: (r_min-1, c_min-1), (r_min-1, c_max+1), (r_max+1, c_min-1), (r_max+1, c_max+1) relative to white bbox (r_min, c_min) to (r_max, c_max)
    relevance: target locations for color assignment via proximity
  - role: color_pixel
    property:
      - color is not white (0)
      - color is not the background color
      - is located within the bounding_box of a white_region OR is cardinally adjacent to a white pixel belonging to that region
    action: determines the color for the nearest corner_pixel's 2x2 block
  - role: output_block
    property: a 2x2 square of pixels
    location: determined by the associated corner_pixel and which corner it is (TL, TR, BL, BR)
    color: determined by the color_pixel closest to the associated corner_pixel
    action: overwrites the corresponding area in the output grid

relationships:
  - type: containment
    from: color_pixel
    to: bounding_box
    relevance: one way a color_pixel is associated with a white_region
  - type: adjacency
    from: color_pixel
    to: white_region pixel
    direction: cardinal
    relevance: alternative way a color_pixel is associated with a white_region
  - type: proximity (nearest distance)
    from: color_pixel
    to: corner_pixel
    relevance: assigns a color_pixel's color to one or more corner_pixels
  - type: placement
    from: corner_pixel
    to: output_block
    relevance: defines the 2x2 area to be colored based on the corner_pixel's location and type (TL/TR/BL/BR)
