            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis, focusing on direct adjacency between trigger pixels and background pixels, was incorrect. The generated outputs failed because the transformation involves a more complex spatial relationship based on the *corners* of white regions and the *proximity* of non-background, non-white \"color pixels\" associated with those regions. The transformation paints 2x2 blocks diagonally offset from the corners of the white regions' bounding boxes, using the color of the nearest associated color pixel.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Identify White Regions:** Use connected components labeling to find each distinct area of white pixels.\n2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** For each white region, calculate its minimum bounding box.\n3.  **Identify Corner Anchors:** Locate the four pixels diagonally adjacent to the corners of the bounding box. These must be within the grid and have the background color to be considered valid \"anchors\".\n4.  **Find Associated Color Pixels:** Identify all non-white, non-background pixels that are either within the bounding box or cardinally adjacent to any white pixel of the current region.\n5.  **Calculate Closest Color:** For each valid corner anchor, calculate the Euclidean distance to all associated color pixels. Assign the color of the *closest* associated pixel to that anchor. Handle ties consistently (e.g., by order of processing pixels).\n6.  **Paint 2x2 Blocks:** For each anchor that received a color assignment, paint a 2x2 block of that color in the output grid. The position of the 2x2 block is specifically offset relative to the anchor's position (e.g., the Top-Left anchor determines a block below and to its right).\n7.  **Maintain Original Grid:** Start with a copy of the input grid and apply the 2x2 block painting modifications.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nWe need tools to accurately identify regions, calculate distances, and manage the logic.\n"
