"""
Transforms the input grid by vertically shifting pixels of the single colored object based on a periodic pattern determined by their column index relative to the object's left edge.

1. Identify the single non-white object, its color, its pixels' coordinates, and its leftmost column index (min_col).
2. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
3. For each pixel (r, c) of the identified object:
   a. Calculate the relative column index: relative_col = c - min_col.
   b. Determine the vertical shift (dy) based on the pattern:
      - dy = 0 if relative_col % 3 == 0
      - dy = 1 if relative_col % 3 == 1 (shift down)
      - dy = -1 if relative_col % 3 == 2 (shift up)
   c. Calculate the target row: new_r = r + dy.
   d. If the target row new_r is within the grid's boundaries, set the pixel at (new_r, c) in the output grid to the object's color.
4. Return the modified output grid.
