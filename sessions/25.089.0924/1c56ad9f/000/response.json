The object generally resembles a character or symbol constructed from segments. The output grid displays the same object, but its vertical columns appear to be shifted alternately up and down relative to their original positions. The background remains unchanged. The shifting pattern seems periodic based on the column's position within the object's horizontal extent.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Identify the single connected block of non-white pixels in the input grid. Determine its color (`object_color`) and the set of coordinates `(r, c)` it occupies.\n    3.  Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) occupied by any pixel of the identified object.\n    4.  Iterate through each pixel coordinate `(r, c)` belonging to the object identified in step 2.\n    5.  For the current pixel at `(r, c)`, calculate its relative column index within the object: `relative_col = c - min_col`.\n    6.  Determine the vertical shift amount (`dy`) based on the `relative_col`:\n        *   If `relative_col` modulo 3 is 1, set `dy = 1` (shift down).\n        *   If `relative_col` modulo 3 is 2, set `dy = -1` (shift up).\n        *   Otherwise (if `relative_col` modulo 3 is 0), set `dy = 0` (no shift).\n    7.  Calculate the target row for the shifted pixel: `new_r = r + dy`.\n    8.  Check if the calculated `new_r` is a valid row index within the grid boundaries.\n    9.  If `new_r` is valid, set the pixel at `(new_r, c)` in the output grid to the `object_color`.\n    10. After iterating through all object pixels, the output grid contains the transformed object.
