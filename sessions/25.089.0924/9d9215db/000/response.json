Their initial positions vary across examples, but they tend to be concentrated in one quadrant (e.g., top-left in example 2, top-right in example 1).\n4.  **Output Pattern:** The output grid is created by taking each non-white pixel from the input grid and reflecting it across the grid's central horizontal axis, central vertical axis, and diagonally through the center point. This creates a four-way symmetry. The original input pixels are preserved in the output.\n5.  **Reflection Logic:**\n    *   For a grid of height H and width W, the central horizontal axis is conceptually between rows `floor((H-1)/2)` and `ceil((H-1)/2)`, and the central vertical axis is between columns `floor((W-1)/2)` and `ceil((W-1)/2)`.\n    *   A pixel at `(r, c)` reflects horizontally to `(r, W - 1 - c)`.\n    *   A pixel at `(r, c)` reflects vertically to `(H - 1 - r, c)`.\n    *   A pixel at `(r, c)` reflects diagonally (horizontally then vertically, or vice versa) to `(H - 1 - r, W - 1 - c)`.\n6.  **Color Preservation:** The color of the reflected pixels is the same as the color of the original pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
