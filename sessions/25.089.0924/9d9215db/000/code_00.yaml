grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids share the same height (H) and width (W).
  - background_color: white (0)
  - content: Sparse non-white pixels on a white background.

objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - location: (row, column) coordinates
      - color: Integer value 1-9 (non-white)
  - type: Grid Center
    properties:
      - horizontal_axis: Between rows floor((H-1)/2) and ceil((H-1)/2)
      - vertical_axis: Between columns floor((W-1)/2) and ceil((W-1)/2)

actions:
  - name: Reflect Pixel
    input: A non-white pixel at (r, c) with color C
    operations:
      - Horizontal Reflection: Calculate target coordinates (r, W - 1 - c).
      - Vertical Reflection: Calculate target coordinates (H - 1 - r, c).
      - Diagonal Reflection: Calculate target coordinates (H - 1 - r, W - 1 - c).
    output: Three potential new pixel locations (or fewer if reflections overlap or map onto the original pixel).
  - name: Update Grid
    input: Input grid, reflection coordinates, color C
    operations:
      - Copy input grid to output grid.
      - For each non-white pixel in the input grid:
        - Determine its color C and location (r, c).
        - Calculate the three reflection coordinates: (r, W-1-c), (H-1-r, c), (H-1-r, W-1-c).
        - Set the color of the pixels at these calculated coordinates in the output grid to C.
    output: The final output grid with original pixels and their reflections.

relationships:
  - Symmetry: The output grid exhibits four-way symmetry (horizontal, vertical, rotational) around the grid's center. Each non-white pixel in the input generates a pattern of up to four identical pixels (including the original) in the output, placed symmetrically with respect to the center.
