These pairs vary slightly between examples but define the transformation rule.\n    *   The right section (columns 10 to 19) contains scattered colored pixels (colors other than white/0) on a white background.\n    *   The transformation only affects the colors of the scattered pixels in the right section. The left section and the red line remain unchanged in the output.\n    *   The color change on the right side depends on the pairs present on the left side.\n\n*   **YAML documenting facts:**\n    "

If a pixel has a non-white color `C` and `C` exists as a key in the final mapping dictionary, update the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the mapped target color.\n    7.
