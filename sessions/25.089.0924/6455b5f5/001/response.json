Identify all distinct connected areas (components) of white (0) pixels using orthogonal adjacency.\n3.  For each white area:\n    a.  Determine if it is \"enclosed\" by red (2) pixels. An area is enclosed if none of its pixels are on the grid's outer border, AND a path of only white pixels cannot reach the border from any pixel within the area. (Effectively, check if any pixel in the area is on the border during the component finding process).\n    b.  If the area is enclosed:\n        i.  Check if *any* pixel within this enclosed white area has red (2) neighbors directly opposite each other (i.e., North and South neighbors are both red, OR East and West neighbors are both red).\n        ii. If such a pixel exists, fill the entire enclosed white area in the output grid with azure (8).\n        iii. Otherwise (if no pixel in the enclosed area has opposite red neighbors), fill the entire enclosed white area in the output grid with blue (1).\n    c.  If the area is not enclosed (touches the grid border), leave it as white (0).\n4.  Red (2) pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  Return the modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_connected_components(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds connected components of white pixels and checks enclosure.\"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    components = [] # List to store tuples: (area_coordinates, is_enclosed)\n\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if grid[r, c] == 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                component_coords = []\n                is_enclosed_flag = True # Assume enclosed initially\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n\n                while q:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = q.popleft()\n                    component_coords.append((curr_r, curr_c))\n\n                    # Check if this pixel is on the border\n                    if curr_r == 0 or curr_r == height - 1 or curr_c == 0 or curr_c == width - 1:\n                        is_enclosed_flag = False # Touched border, not enclosed\n\n                    # Explore neighbors\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == 0 and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n\n                # Store the found component and its enclosure status\n                # The check during BFS/DFS is sufficient for enclosure.
