The output grids retain the original red structures but fill certain white areas with either blue (1) or azure (8). The key transformation is identifying white areas completely enclosed by red pixels and filling them based on the shape or configuration of the enclosing red boundary. White areas not enclosed or areas enclosed in different ways receive different fill colors.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Identify all connected components (areas) of white (0) pixels in the input grid using orthogonal adjacency.\n    3.  For each distinct white area:\n        a.  Determine if the area is \"enclosed\". Perform a search (e.g., Flood Fill, BFS, DFS) starting from any pixel within the area, moving only orthogonally through white pixels. If the search reaches any pixel on the boundary edge of the grid, the area is *not* enclosed. Otherwise, it *is* enclosed.\n        b.  If the area is enclosed:\n            i.  Set a flag `fill_with_azure` to `false`.\n            ii. Iterate through each white pixel `(r, c)` belonging to this enclosed area.\n            iii. Check the orthogonal neighbours of `(r, c)`.\n            iv. If `(r, c)` has red (2) neighbours both to the North `(r-1, c)` and South `(r+1, c)`, OR if it has red neighbours both to the West `(r, c-1)` and East `(r, c+1)`, set `fill_with_azure` to `true` and break the loop for this area (move to step 3.b.vii).\n            v.  Alternatively, check if `(r, c)` is adjacent to an \"inner corner\" of the red structure. This occurs if a red neighbour `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)` itself has at least two red neighbours such that `(r, c)`, `(nr, nc)`, and the two other red neighbours form a 2x2 block where `(r, c)` is the only white pixel. If such an inner corner configuration is found adjacent to any pixel in the white area, set `fill_with_azure` to `true` and break the loop for this area (move to step 3.b.vii).\n            vi. If after checking all pixels in the area, `fill_with_azure` remains `false`, the area should be filled with blue (1).\n            vii. Based on the final value of `fill_with_azure`:\n                *   If `true`, fill all pixels corresponding to this white area in the output grid with azure (8).\n                *   If `false`, fill all pixels corresponding to this white area in the output grid with blue (1).\n    4.
