**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming an input grid composed of white (0) and gray (5) pixels into an output grid. The transformation specifically targets white pixels. By comparing the input and output grids across the provided examples, it's evident that the output grid retains the structure and gray pixels of the input grid. The only change is that certain white pixels in the input are converted to red (2) pixels in the output. The key pattern is the identification of 2x2 blocks consisting entirely of white pixels in the input. Wherever such a 2x2 white block is found, all four pixels constituting that block are changed to red in the output grid. This transformation applies to all instances of 2x2 white blocks, even if they overlap. Pixels belonging to multiple overlapping 2x2 white blocks are still simply changed to red.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
# Focus on the transformation from input to output grid

# Grid properties:
grid_dimensions:
  variable: true # width and height can vary between examples
  range: 1x1 to 30x30

# Colors involved:
colors:
  input:
    - white (0)
    - gray (5)
  output:
    - white (0) # some white pixels remain unchanged
    - gray (5) # all gray pixels remain unchanged
    - red (2) # appears in output where specific patterns exist in input

# Core Objects/Patterns:
- object: 2x2_white_block
  definition: A square block of four pixels arranged in a 2x2 configuration, where all four pixels have the color white (0).
  location: Can occur anywhere within the grid boundaries.
  overlap: Allowed; multiple 2x2 white blocks can share pixels.

# Transformation rule:
transformation:
  action: pattern_replacement
  input_pattern: 2x2_white_block (all pixels are white (0))
  output_pattern: 2x2_red_block (all pixels are red (2))
  condition: Identify all occurrences of the input_pattern in the input grid.
  effect: For every identified input_pattern, change the corresponding pixels in the output grid to match the output_pattern.
  unchanged_pixels:
    - Gray (5) pixels remain unchanged.
    - White (0) pixels that are NOT part of any 2x2_white_block remain unchanged.

# Relationships:
- relationship: input_output_correspondence
  description: The output grid is initially a copy of the input grid, modified according to the transformation rule.
- relationship: spatial_adjacency
  description: The rule relies on the spatial adjacency of pixels to form the 2x2 block pattern.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through all possible top-left corner positions `(row, col)` for a 2x2 block within the input grid. This means iterating `row` from 0 to `height - 2` and `col` from 0 to `width - 2`.
3.  For each position `(row, col)`, check if the four pixels at `(row, col)`, `(row + 1, col)`, `(row, col + 1)`, and `(row + 1, col + 1)` in the *input* grid are all white (0).
4.  If all four pixels form a 2x2 white block, then change the color of the corresponding four pixels at `(row, col)`, `(row + 1, col)`, `(row, col + 1)`, and `(row + 1, col + 1)` in the *output* grid to red (2).
5.  After checking all possible 2x2 block positions, the final state of the output grid represents the result of the transformation.
