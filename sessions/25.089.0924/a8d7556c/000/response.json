            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid composed of white (0) and gray (5) pixels into an output grid. The transformation specifically targets white pixels. By comparing the input and output grids across the provided examples, it's evident that the output grid retains the structure and gray pixels of the input grid. The only change is that certain white pixels in the input are converted to red (2) pixels in the output. The key pattern is the identification of 2x2 blocks consisting entirely of white pixels in the input. Wherever such a 2x2 white block is found, all four pixels constituting that block are changed to red in the output grid. This transformation applies to all instances of 2x2 white blocks, even if they overlap. Pixels belonging to multiple overlapping 2x2 white blocks are still simply changed to red.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Iterate through all possible top-left corner positions `(row, col)` for a 2x2 block within the input grid. This means iterating `row` from 0 to `height - 2` and `col` from 0 to `width - 2`.\n3.  For each position `(row, col)`, check if the four pixels at `(row, col)`, `(row + 1, col)`, `(row, col + 1)`, and `(row + 1, col + 1)` in the *input* grid are all white (0).\n4.  If all four pixels form a 2x2 white block, then change the color of the corresponding four pixels at `(row, col)`, `(row + 1, col)`, `(row, col + 1)`, and `(row + 1, col + 1)` in the *output* grid to red (2).\n5.  After checking all possible 2x2 block positions, the final state of the output grid represents the result of the transformation."
