"""
Identifies the initial blue (1) object(s) and all yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
Calculates the minimum bounding box enclosing all yellow pixels.
Performs a flood fill (using 4-way adjacency) starting from the initial blue pixels.
The fill expands only into adjacent white (0) pixels.
The expansion is constrained to occur ONLY within the bounding box defined by the yellow pixels.
Yellow pixels also act as explicit barriers, stopping the fill.
Grid boundaries also stop the fill.
The final output grid contains the original yellow pixels, the original blue pixels, and the newly filled blue pixels within the constrained area.
