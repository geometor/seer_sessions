            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code execution resulted in significant errors, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding or flawed implementation of the transformation rule. The generated outputs incorrectly filled almost the entire grid with blue (1), whereas the expected outputs show a much more constrained fill.\n\nThe core observation remains that the blue color (1) expands from its initial position(s). The key seems to lie in correctly identifying the constraints on this expansion. The yellow pixels (4) clearly act as barriers, and the expansion only occurs into white (0) pixels. The previous code's failure suggests either a logical error in implementing the barrier/fill condition or an issue in how the `visited` set was managed, leading to uncontrolled expansion.\n\nThe strategy is to re-analyze the relationship between the initial blue pixels, the white background, the yellow barriers, and the final blue area in the output. We will confirm the barrier behavior of yellow pixels and refine the flood fill algorithm to strictly respect these boundaries.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n"
