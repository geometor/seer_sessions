The key observation missed was the role of the yellow pixels in defining a bounding box for the fill operation. The blue fill should only occur within the minimum bounding rectangle encompassing all yellow pixels.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Identify all yellow pixel coordinates in the input grid.\n2.  Calculate the minimum bounding box (min/max row and column) containing all these yellow pixels.\n3.  Perform the flood fill starting from the initial blue pixels.\n4.  Modify the fill condition: a white pixel can only be filled blue if it is adjacent to a blue pixel (or part of the expanding frontier), it is not adjacent to a yellow pixel (implicit barrier), AND it lies *within* the calculated bounding box of the yellow pixels.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
