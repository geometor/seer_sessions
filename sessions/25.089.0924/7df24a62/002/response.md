**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial `transform` function incorrectly implemented the flood fill, resulting in blue pixels overwriting almost the entire grid instead of being constrained. The key observation missed was the role of the yellow pixels in defining a bounding box for the fill operation. The blue fill should only occur within the minimum bounding rectangle encompassing all yellow pixels.

The strategy is to:
1.  Identify all yellow pixel coordinates in the input grid.
2.  Calculate the minimum bounding box (min/max row and column) containing all these yellow pixels.
3.  Perform the flood fill starting from the initial blue pixels.
4.  Modify the fill condition: a white pixel can only be filled blue if it is adjacent to a blue pixel (or part of the expanding frontier), it is not adjacent to a yellow pixel (implicit barrier), AND it lies *within* the calculated bounding box of the yellow pixels.
