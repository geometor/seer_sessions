Initialize the output grid as a direct copy of the input grid.\n2. Identify all pixels in the input grid that are blue (1). These form the initial \"frontier\" for the fill.\n3. Identify all non-white (0) pixels (including the initial blue ones and any other colors like yellow (4)). These act as barriers or starting points and should not be overwritten, nor should the fill pass through them. Mark all these non-white pixels as \"visited\" initially.\n4. Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach starting from the initial blue pixels:\n    a. While the frontier (queue) is not empty, take a pixel coordinate (r, c) from it.\n    b. Examine its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n    c. For each neighbor (nr, nc):\n        i. Check if it's within the grid boundaries.\n        ii. Check if it has already been visited.\n        iii. If the neighbor is within bounds and not visited (meaning it must be a white pixel in the input):\n            - Change the color of this neighbor pixel in the *output* grid to blue (1).\n            - Mark the neighbor as visited.\n            - Add the neighbor's coordinate to the frontier.\n5. Continue the BFS until the frontier is empty.\n6.
