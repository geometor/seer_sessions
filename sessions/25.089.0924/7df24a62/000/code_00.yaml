elements:
  - type: grid
    background_color: white (0)
  - type: object
    color: blue (1)
    description: A single contiguous shape in the input. This shape expands in the output.
    relationship: Source of the fill operation.
  - type: object
    color: yellow (4)
    description: Multiple single pixels scattered across the grid.
    properties:
      - immutable: Position and color remain unchanged from input to output.
      - barrier: Blocks the expansion of the blue object.
    relationship: Constrains the blue fill.
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    description: Background pixels.
    properties:
      - mutable: Can change to blue under specific conditions.
    relationship: Target of the fill operation.

transformation:
  type: flood_fill / region_growing
  source: Pixels belonging to the initial blue object.
  target: Contiguous white pixels reachable from the source.
  fill_color: blue (1)
  boundaries:
    - grid edges
    - yellow pixels

process:
  - Identify all initial blue pixels. These are the starting points for the fill.
  - Identify all yellow pixels. These are barriers.
  - Perform a flood fill (using 4-way adjacency - up, down, left, right) starting from the initial blue pixels.
  - The fill propagates only through white pixels.
  - The fill stops at grid boundaries and yellow pixels.
  - All reachable white pixels are colored blue in the output.
  - The original blue and yellow pixels retain their colors and positions in the output grid.
