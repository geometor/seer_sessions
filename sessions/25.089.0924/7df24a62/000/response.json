            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** Contains a background of white pixels (0), a single contiguous object composed of blue pixels (1), and several scattered individual yellow pixels (4).\n2.  **Output Grid:** Shows the original yellow pixels unchanged in their positions. The original blue object is still present, but it has expanded. The expansion fills adjacent white pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a region-growing or flood-fill operation originating from the initial blue object.\n4.  **Constraints:** The expansion of the blue region seems to be constrained. It does not overwrite the yellow pixels. Yellow pixels act as barriers to the expansion. The expansion also stops at the grid boundaries.\n5.  **Mechanism:** White pixels that are adjacent (sharing a side, not just diagonally) to a blue pixel (either original or newly filled) become blue in the output, *unless* that white pixel is adjacent to a yellow pixel. It appears the check for adjacent yellow pixels takes precedence; if a white pixel is next to *any* yellow pixel, it cannot turn blue, even if it's also next to a blue pixel. However, looking closely at train_1 (row 14, col 10-11) and train_3 (row 0, col 1-5), it seems the rule is simpler: the fill starts from the existing blue pixels and expands into adjacent white pixels. The expansion stops *only* when it hits a yellow pixel or the grid boundary. A white pixel turns blue if it can be reached from the original blue shape by moving only through white cells (up, down, left, right) without crossing a yellow cell.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Add their coordinates to a queue or list of pixels to process (the \"frontier\"). Keep track of pixels that have been visited or added to the queue to avoid redundant processing. Mark the initial blue pixels as visited.\n3.  While the frontier is not empty:\n    a.  Dequeue a pixel coordinate (row, col).\n    b.  For each of its four neighbors (up, down, left, right):\n        i.  Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.\n        ii. Check if the neighbor has already been visited or is in the frontier.\n        iii. Check if the neighbor pixel in the *input* grid is white (0).\n        iv. If all checks pass (within bounds, not visited, is white in input):\n            1.  Change the color of the neighbor pixel in the *output* grid to blue (1).\n            2.  Mark the neighbor as visited.\n            3.  Enqueue the neighbor's coordinates to the frontier.\n4.  The final state of the output grid is the result. (Note: Yellow pixels are implicitly handled because the fill only propagates into white pixels, effectively stopping when encountering a non-white pixel like yellow or an already-filled blue pixel)."
