Initialize the output grid as a direct copy of the input grid.\n2. Identify all pixels in the input grid that are blue (1). These form the initial \"frontier\" for the fill and are marked as \"visited\".\n3. Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach:\n    a. While the frontier is not empty, take a pixel coordinate (r, c) from it.\n    b. Examine its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n    c. For each neighbor (nr, nc):\n        i. Check if it's within the grid boundaries.\n        ii. Check if it has already been visited.\n        iii. Check if the neighbor's color in the *input* grid is white (0).\n        iv. If the neighbor is within bounds, not visited, AND is white (0) in the input:\n            - Change the color of this neighbor pixel in the *output* grid to blue (1).\n            - Mark the neighbor as visited.\n            - Add the neighbor's coordinate to the frontier.\n        v. If the neighbor is within bounds, not visited, BUT is *not* white (0) in the input (e.g., it's yellow(4) or another color):\n            - Mark the neighbor as visited to avoid reprocessing paths leading to it, but do not change its color or add it to the frontier. This effectively makes non-white cells barriers.\n4. Continue the BFS until the frontier is empty.\n5.
