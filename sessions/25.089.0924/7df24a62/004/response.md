**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial hypothesis involved a flood fill originating from blue pixels, constrained by yellow pixels acting as barriers, potentially within a bounding box defined by those yellow pixels. The results from executing the previous code show significant deviations, primarily over-filling areas with blue. This indicates the bounding box constraint was incorrect.

The core mechanism appears to be a flood fill, but the interaction with the yellow barrier pixels needs refinement. The yellow pixels seem to act as local "repulsors" or blockers for the fill process. A white pixel adjacent to an initial or newly filled blue pixel should only turn blue if it is *not* adjacent to any yellow pixel.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the "local barrier" behavior of yellow pixels by examining the examples more closely, particularly near interfaces between blue, white, and yellow pixels.
2.  Calculate bounding boxes to formally disprove the global bounding box constraint idea.
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the refined understanding of the yellow pixel barrier rule.
