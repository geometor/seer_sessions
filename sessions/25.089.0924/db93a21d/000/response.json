These frames merge where they touch or overlap. Specifically, any pixel that was white in the input and is adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one maroon pixel becomes green in the output.\n5.  **Blue Transformation:** Blue pixels form solid rectangles. These blue rectangles appear in areas that were white in the input AND were *not* adjacent to any maroon pixels (i.e., did not become part of the green frame).\n6.  **Blue Region Rule:** Further analysis reveals that the grid is first populated with the maroon blocks and their green frames. The remaining white pixels are analyzed. Connected components of these remaining white pixels are identified. If a connected component perfectly forms a rectangle, that entire component is colored blue. Otherwise (if the component is not rectangular), it remains white.\n7.  **Color Palette:** Input uses white (0) and maroon (9). Output uses white (0), blue (1), green (3), and maroon (9).\n8.  **Connectivity:** Adjacency (8 directions, including diagonals) is crucial for determining the green frame. Connectivity (8 directions) is used to find components of the remaining white space for the blue rule.\n\n**Facts**\n\n```"
