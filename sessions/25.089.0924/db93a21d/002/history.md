**Perception**

1.  **Input Objects:** The input grids contain one or more rectangular blocks of maroon (9) pixels on a white (0) background.
2.  **Output Objects:** The output grids contain the original maroon (9) blocks, green (3) shapes surrounding them, and sometimes blue (1) rectangular blocks, all on a white (0) background.
3.  **Maroon Transformation:** The maroon blocks from the input are preserved in their exact locations in the output.
4.  **Green Transformation:** Green pixels form a 1-pixel thick frame around each original maroon block. These frames merge where they touch or overlap. Specifically, any pixel that was white in the input and is adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one maroon pixel becomes green in the output.
5.  **Blue Transformation:** Blue pixels form solid rectangles. These blue rectangles appear in areas that were white in the input AND were *not* adjacent to any maroon pixels (i.e., did not become part of the green frame).
6.  **Blue Region Rule:** Further analysis reveals that the grid is first populated with the maroon blocks and their green frames. The remaining white pixels are analyzed. Connected components of these remaining white pixels are identified. If a connected component perfectly forms a rectangle, that entire component is colored blue. Otherwise (if the component is not rectangular), it remains white.
7.  **Color Palette:** Input uses white (0) and maroon (9). Output uses white (0), blue (1), green (3), and maroon (9).
8.  **Connectivity:** Adjacency (8 directions, including diagonals) is crucial for determining the green frame. Connectivity (8 directions) is used to find components of the remaining white space for the blue rule.

**Facts**

```
yaml
Input Grid:
  - Background: white (0) pixels
  - Objects:
      - Type: Solid rectangles
      - Color: maroon (9)
      - Quantity: Variable (1 or more per example)
      - Properties: Defined by position, height, width.

Output Grid:
  - Background: white (0) pixels
  - Objects:
      - Type: Solid rectangles
      - Color: maroon (9)
      - Source: Copied directly from input objects.
      - Type: Frames/Regions
      - Color: green (3)
      - Source: Derived from input maroon objects. Represents pixels adjacent (8-way) to any maroon pixel.
      - Rule: A white input pixel becomes green if it neighbors a maroon pixel. Frames merge.
      - Type: Solid rectangles
      - Color: blue (1)
      - Source: Derived from remaining white space after placing maroon and green.
      - Rule: Fill connected components of remaining white pixels *if* the component forms a perfect rectangle.

Relationships & Actions:
  - Persistence: Maroon objects persist from input to output.
  - Generation (Green): Green frames are generated based on proximity (adjacency) to maroon objects.
  - Generation (Blue): Blue rectangles are generated by filling specific connected components of the remaining white space based on a geometric property (being a rectangle).
  - Precedence: Maroon color takes precedence over green. Green color takes precedence over blue/white. Blue takes precedence over remaining white.

import numpy as np
from collections import deque

"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:

1.  Preserve Original Objects: Any maroon (9) pixels in the input grid are kept in the same position in the output grid.
2.  Create Green Frames: Any white (0) pixel in the input grid that is adjacent (including diagonally, 8-way connectivity) to at least one maroon (9) pixel becomes green (3) in the output grid. If multiple maroon blocks are close, their green frames merge.
3.  Identify Remaining White Regions: After placing the maroon pixels and generating the green frames, identify the connected components of the remaining white (0) pixels using 8-way connectivity.
4.  Fill Rectangular White Regions with Blue: For each connected component of white pixels identified in step 3, determine if the shape of the component forms a perfect rectangle. If it does, fill all pixels within that component with blue (1) in the output grid. If the component is not a perfect rectangle, its pixels remain white (0).
5.  Precedence: Maroon pixels take precedence over green. Green pixels take precedence over potential blue or remaining white pixels. Blue pixels take precedence over remaining white pixels.
