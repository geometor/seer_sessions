Scattered across this background are various small colored shapes or individual pixels. Crucially, each input grid contains a single rectangular area composed entirely of white (0) pixels. Within this white rectangle, there are a few non-white pixels. The output grid is significantly smaller than the input and corresponds exactly in size to the white rectangular area found in the input. The content of the output grid consists of the non-white pixels from within the input's white rectangle, placed at the same relative positions, against a white background. All other elements from the input grid are discarded.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
