For each identified white region, check if it is fully enclosed by gray pixels (color 5). A region is considered fully enclosed if none of its pixels are on the border of the grid, and all adjacent non-white pixels are gray. (Alternatively, perform a flood fill starting from each white pixel; if the fill reaches the edge of the grid without crossing a gray pixel, it's not enclosed. If the fill stops only at gray pixels, it is enclosed).\n    3.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n    4.  For every white pixel identified in step 1 that belongs to a fully enclosed region (determined in step 2), change its color to yellow (color 4) in the output grid.\n    5.  Leave all other pixels (gray pixels and non-enclosed white pixels) unchanged in the output grid."
