**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Each example consists of an input grid and a corresponding output grid of the same dimensions.
2.  **Colors Present:** The primary colors involved are gray (8), blue (1), magenta (6), and orange (7). Gray is the predominant background color in the input. Blue forms lines or boundaries. Magenta appears as a single pixel in each input. Orange appears in the output, replacing some of the gray pixels.
3.  **Static Elements:** The blue lines (1) and the single magenta pixel (6) appear in the exact same positions in both the input and output grids.
4.  **Dynamic Elements:** Some of the gray pixels (8) in the input are changed to orange pixels (7) in the output. The remaining gray pixels stay gray.
5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation looks like a flood fill or region-filling algorithm. The area filled with orange (7) seems to originate from the position of the magenta pixel (6). The fill spreads through connected gray (8) areas, treating the blue lines (1) and the grid boundaries as barriers. The magenta pixel itself is the starting point but retains its magenta color.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - Background:
      color: gray (8)
      role: Main canvas, some parts are modified.
  - Boundaries:
      color: blue (1)
      shape: Lines (vertical, horizontal, L-shaped segments)
      role: Act as barriers, remain unchanged.
  - Seed Point:
      color: magenta (6)
      shape: Single pixel
      role: Marks the starting location for the transformation, remains unchanged.
  - Fill Color:
      color: orange (7)
      role: Replaces gray pixels in the output within a specific region.
transformation:
  type: Flood Fill / Region Filling
  origin: Position of the magenta (6) pixel.
  target_color: gray (8)
  replacement_color: orange (7)
  barrier_colors: [blue (1)]
  connectivity: 4-way (horizontal and vertical adjacency)
  boundary_handling: Grid edges act as barriers.
  unchanged_elements:
    - All blue (1) pixels.
    - The single magenta (6) pixel.
    - Gray (8) pixels outside the filled region.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Locate the coordinates (row, column) of the single magenta pixel (color 6) in the input grid.
3.  Perform a flood fill operation starting from these coordinates.
4.  The flood fill should identify contiguous regions of gray pixels (color 8) connected horizontally or vertically.
5.  Replace all reachable gray pixels (color 8) identified in step 4 with orange pixels (color 7) in the output grid.
6.  The flood fill must not cross or replace blue pixels (color 1) or go beyond the grid boundaries. Blue pixels and boundaries act as barriers to the fill.
7.  Ensure that the original magenta pixel (color 6) and all blue pixels (color 1) retain their original colors and positions in the output grid.
