Context:
  Task_Type: Noise removal and pattern standardization.
  Grid_Properties: Input and output grids have the same dimensions. Background color is white (0).

Objects:
  - Type: Rectangular Blocks
    Properties:
      - Composed of multiple colors.
      - Appear as distinct units separated by the background color.
      - Have a recognizable internal pattern.
      - Occur multiple times in the input grid, often arranged grid-like.
      - Contain 'imperfections' or 'noise' (pixels deviating from the standard pattern) in the input.
    Examples:
      - Train_1: Blocks with rows of [1, 1, 2, 3, 3] and a bottom row of [8, 8, 8, 8, 8].
      - Train_2: Blocks with rows of [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6] and [8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8].
      - Train_3: Blocks with patterns involving colors 1 (blue), 2 (red), and 3 (green).

  - Type: Noise Pixels
    Properties:
      - Non-background pixels located *outside* the main Rectangular Blocks.
      - Non-background pixels located *inside* the main Rectangular Blocks but deviating from the block's standard pattern.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all instances of the repeating Rectangular Block patterns in the input grid.
  - Standardize: Determine the 'canonical' or 'template' pattern for each type of Rectangular Block identified (likely based on the most frequent pixel value at each relative position within observed instances).
  - Clean/Correct: Replace the pixels within each identified block in the input with the pixels from its corresponding canonical template.
  - Remove: Replace all Noise Pixels (both internal to blocks before correction and external) with the background color (white/0).

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Blocks are separated by the background color. Noise pixels can be internal or external to blocks.
  - Transformation: Input blocks (with noise) map to output blocks (standardized templates). Input noise pixels map to background color in the output.

Goal: Produce an output grid containing only the standardized versions of the Rectangular Blocks found in the input, positioned correctly, with all other areas set to the background color.
