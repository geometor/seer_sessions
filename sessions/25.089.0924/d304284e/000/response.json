            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain a mostly white (0) background with a single, connected object of a specific color (orange=7). The object's shape varies between examples ('8' shape in train_1, 'H' shape in train_2).\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids also have a white background. They feature multiple copies of the input object, tiled across the grid.\n3.  **Transformation - Tiling:** The core operation is tiling or repeating the input object. The copies are placed at regular intervals. By comparing the top-left corners of the object and its copies, a consistent step or offset (4 pixels horizontally and 4 pixels vertically) is observed in both examples.\n4.  **Transformation - Color Change:** The color of the tiled copies is not always the same as the original object. A secondary color (magenta=6) is introduced. The color of each copy depends on its position relative to the original object's position within the tiling pattern.\n5.  **Color Pattern Logic:**\n    *   Copies in the same horizontal row as the original object alternate between the original color (orange=7) and the alternate color (magenta=6). The pattern seems to be: orange, orange, magenta, orange, orange, magenta... This corresponds to the alternate color (magenta) appearing when the horizontal step index `i` (where the copy's column is `original_col + 4*i`) satisfies `i % 3 == 2`.\n    *   Copies in rows *below* the original object *only* appear in columns where the horizontal step index `i` satisfies `i % 3 == 2`. All these copies use the alternate color (magenta=6). Copies are *not* placed in other columns below the original row.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Record its shape, its color (let's call this `original_color`, which is orange=7), and the row and column of its top-left pixel (r0, c0). Define an `alternate_color` (magenta=6) and a `step_size` (4).\n2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.\n3.  Iterate through possible tile locations by calculating potential top-left corners (r, c) using the formula `(r, c) = (r0 + step_size * j, c0 + step_size * i)`, starting with `i=0, j=0` and increasing `i` and `j` as long as placing the pattern at (r, c) remains within the grid boundaries.\n4.  For each potential location (r, c) corresponding to indices (i, j):\n    a.  If `j` is 0 (meaning the copy is in the same horizontal band as the original pattern):\n        i.  Check the horizontal index `i`. If `i` divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2 (`i % 3 == 2`), set the drawing color to `alternate_color`.\n        ii. Otherwise (if `i % 3` is 0 or 1), set the drawing color to `original_color`.\n        iii. Draw the recorded pattern shape onto the output grid at location (r, c) using the determined drawing color.\n    b.  If `j` is greater than 0 (meaning the copy is in a row below the original pattern):\n        i.  Check the horizontal index `i`. If `i` divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2 (`i % 3 == 2`), set the drawing color to `alternate_color`.\n        ii. Draw the recorded pattern shape onto the output grid at location (r, c) using `alternate_color`.\n        iii. If `i % 3` is *not* 2, do *not* draw anything at this location (r, c).\n5.  The final state of the output grid after checking all possible locations is the result."
