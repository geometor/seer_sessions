task_description: Tile a pattern found in the input grid across the output grid with specific color modifications based on relative position.

elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: pattern
    description: A single contiguous object of a non-background color found in the input.
    properties:
      - color: orange (7) in examples
      - shape: variable ('8' or 'H' in examples)
      - location: defined by its top-left corner (r0, c0)
  - type: alternate_color
    value: magenta (6)
  - type: tiling_parameters
    properties:
      - horizontal_step: 4 pixels
      - vertical_step: 4 pixels

actions:
  - action: identify_pattern
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: pattern_shape, pattern_color (original_color), top_left_corner (r0, c0)
  - action: initialize_output
    inputs: input_grid_dimensions
    outputs: output_grid (filled with background color)
  - action: tile_pattern
    inputs: output_grid, pattern_shape, original_color, alternate_color, r0, c0, horizontal_step, vertical_step
    outputs: modified_output_grid
    details:
      - Iterate through potential copy positions (r, c) = (r0 + vertical_step * j, c0 + horizontal_step * i) for i >= 0, j >= 0.
      - Check if the pattern fits within grid bounds at (r, c).
      - Determine the color for the copy at (r, c) based on i and j:
        - If j == 0:
          - color = alternate_color if i % 3 == 2 else original_color
          - Place the pattern with 'color' at (r, c).
        - If j > 0:
          - if i % 3 == 2:
            - color = alternate_color
            - Place the pattern with 'color' at (r, c).
          - else:
            - Do not place a pattern at this (r, c).

relationships:
  - The output grid size is the same as the input grid size.
  - The pattern shape is preserved in all copies.
  - The color of a copy depends on its relative indices (i, j) in the tiling grid originating from the initial pattern.
