Identify the single connected object (pattern) of non-background color (white=0) in the input grid.\n2. Record the pattern's shape (relative coordinates of its pixels), its original color, and the coordinates of its top-left pixel (r0, c0).\n3. Define an alternate color (magenta=6) and a step size (4).\n4. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.\n5. Tile the pattern across the output grid starting from (r0, c0). The top-left corner of each potential copy is calculated as (r, c) = (r0 + step_size * j, c0 + step_size * i) for non-negative integers i and j.\n6. For each potential copy at indices (i, j):\n    a. If the copy is in the original row (j=0):\n        - Use the alternate color if the horizontal index i is 2 modulo 3 (i % 3 == 2).\n        - Otherwise, use the original color.\n        - Place the pattern at (r, c) with the chosen color, provided it fits within the grid.\n    b. If the copy is in a subsequent row (j > 0):\n        - Place the pattern *only* if the horizontal index i is 2 modulo 3 (i % 3 == 2).\n        - If placed, use the alternate color.\n        - Ensure the pattern fits within the grid.\n7.
