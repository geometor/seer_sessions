Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain a mostly white (0) background with a single, connected object of a specific color (orange=7). The object's shape varies between examples ('8' shape in train_1, 'H' shape in train_2).
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids also have a white background. They feature multiple copies of the input object, tiled across the grid.
3.  **Transformation - Tiling:** The core operation is tiling or repeating the input object. The copies are placed at regular intervals. By comparing the top-left corners of the object and its copies, a consistent step or offset (4 pixels horizontally and 4 pixels vertically) is observed in both examples.
4.  **Transformation - Color Change:** The color of the tiled copies is not always the same as the original object. A secondary color (magenta=6) is introduced. The color of each copy depends on its position relative to the original object's position within the tiling pattern.
5.  **Color Pattern Logic:**
    *   Copies in the same horizontal row as the original object alternate between the original color (orange=7) and the alternate color (magenta=6). The pattern seems to be: orange, orange, magenta, orange, orange, magenta... This corresponds to the alternate color (magenta) appearing when the horizontal step index `i` (where the copy's column is `original_col + 4*i`) satisfies `i % 3 == 2`.
    *   Copies in rows *below* the original object *only* appear in columns where the horizontal step index `i` satisfies `i % 3 == 2`. All these copies use the alternate color (magenta=6). Copies are *not* placed in other columns below the original row.

**Facts (YAML):**

elements:
  - type: background

    description: A single contiguous object of a non-background color found in the input.
    properties:
      - color: orange (7) in examples
      - shape: variable ('8' or 'H' in examples)
      - location: defined by its top-left corner (r0, c0)
  - type: alternate_color
    value: magenta (6)
  - type: tiling_parameters
    properties:
      - horizontal_step: 4 pixels
      - vertical_step: 4 pixels

actions:
  - action: identify_pattern
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: pattern_shape, pattern_color (original_color), top_left_corner (r0, c0)
  - action: initialize_output
    inputs: input_grid_dimensions
    outputs: output_grid (filled with background color)
  - action: tile_pattern
    inputs: output_grid, pattern_shape, original_color, alternate_color, r0, c0, horizontal_step, vertical_step
    outputs: modified_output_grid
    details:
      - Iterate through potential copy positions (r, c) = (r0 + vertical_step * j, c0 + horizontal_step * i) for i >= 0, j >= 0.
      - Check if the pattern fits within grid bounds at (r, c).
      - Determine the color for the copy at (r, c) based on i and j:
        - If j == 0:
          - color = alternate_color if i % 3 == 2 else original_color
          - Place the pattern with 'color' at (r, c).
        - If j > 0:
          - if i % 3 == 2:
            - color = alternate_color
            - Place the pattern with 'color' at (r, c).
          - else:
            - Do not place a pattern at this (r, c).

relationships:
  - The output grid size is the same as the input grid size.
  - The pattern shape is preserved in all copies.
  - The color of a copy depends on its relative indices (i, j) in the tiling grid originating from the initial pattern.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single connected block of non-white pixels in the input grid. This is the 'pattern'. Record its shape, its color (let's call this `original_color`, which is orange=7), and the row and column of its top-left pixel (r0, c0). Define an `alternate_color` (magenta=6) and a `step_size` (4).
2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
3.  Iterate through possible tile locations by calculating potential top-left corners (r, c) using the formula `(r, c) = (r0 + step_size * j, c0 + step_size * i)`, starting with `i=0, j=0` and increasing `i` and `j` as long as placing the pattern at (r, c) remains within the grid boundaries.
4.  For each potential location (r, c) corresponding to indices (i, j):
    a.  If `j` is 0 (meaning the copy is in the same horizontal band as the original pattern):
        i.  Check the horizontal index `i`. If `i` divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2 (`i % 3 == 2`), set the drawing color to `alternate_color`.
        ii. Otherwise (if `i % 3` is 0 or 1), set the drawing color to `original_color`.
        iii. Draw the recorded pattern shape onto the output grid at location (r, c) using the determined drawing color.
    b.  If `j` is greater than 0 (meaning the copy is in a row below the original pattern):
        i.  Check the horizontal index `i`. If `i` divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2 (`i % 3 == 2`), set the drawing color to `alternate_color`.
        ii. Draw the recorded pattern shape onto the output grid at location (r, c) using `alternate_color`.
        iii. If `i % 3` is *not* 2, do *not* draw anything at this location (r, c).
5.  The final state of the output grid after checking all possible locations is the result.

"""
Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the single connected object (pattern) of non-background color (white=0) in the input grid.
2. Record the pattern's shape (relative coordinates of its pixels), its original color, and the coordinates of its top-left pixel (r0, c0).
3. Define an alternate color (magenta=6) and a step size (4).
4. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
5. Tile the pattern across the output grid starting from (r0, c0). The top-left corner of each potential copy is calculated as (r, c) = (r0 + step_size * j, c0 + step_size * i) for non-negative integers i and j.
6. For each potential copy at indices (i, j):
    a. If the copy is in the original row (j=0):
        - Use the alternate color if the horizontal index i is 2 modulo 3 (i % 3 == 2).
        - Otherwise, use the original color.
        - Place the pattern at (r, c) with the chosen color, provided it fits within the grid.
    b. If the copy is in a subsequent row (j > 0):
        - Place the pattern *only* if the horizontal index i is 2 modulo 3 (i % 3 == 2).
        - If placed, use the alternate color.
        - Ensure the pattern fits within the grid.
7. Return the final output grid.
