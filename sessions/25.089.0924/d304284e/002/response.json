            "text": "**General Assessment & Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the tiling nature (step size 4) and the basic color alternation rule (Orange, Orange, Magenta repeating horizontally). However, it failed because it assumed the *same* pattern (the one from the input) was tiled everywhere. The key insight from comparing the failures, particularly in Example 2, is that there are *two* patterns involved:\n\n1.  **Input Pattern:** The shape found in the input grid. This pattern is tiled horizontally in its original row (`j=0`).\n2.  **Fixed Pattern:** A specific 3x3 '8' shape (seen in Example 1's input and in the lower rows of *both* examples' outputs). This pattern is tiled in the rows *below* the original (`j > 0`).\n\nFurthermore, the initial code incorrectly stopped drawing patterns if they didn't fit entirely within the grid. The expected outputs show partially drawn patterns at the edges.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the pattern identification to store the `input_pattern_shape`.\n2.  Hardcode the `fixed_pattern_shape` (the '8' shape).\n3.  Update the tiling loop:\n    *   For `j=0`, use `input_pattern_shape` with the O-O-M color rule (`original_color` if `i % 3 != 2`, `alternate_color` if `i % 3 == 2`).\n    *   For `j>0`, use `fixed_pattern_shape` *only* if `i % 3 == 2`, always with `alternate_color`.\n4.  Modify the `place_pattern` function to draw pixels individually, checking bounds for each pixel, allowing partial patterns.\n\n**Metrics & Observations:**\n\nLet's analyze the patterns and coordinates more closely.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Pattern ('8' shape): Color=7 (Orange), Top-Left=(5, 3), Size=3x3. Offsets: `[(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]`\n    *   Grid Size: 23x28\n    *   Output Tiling: Step=4.\n        *   j=0: Input pattern tiled O, O, M, O, O, M... Partial 'O' pattern expected at (5, 27).\n        *   j>0: Fixed '8' pattern tiled only at i=2, 5, ..., using M. Partial 'M' patterns expected at (21, 11) and (21, 23).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Pattern ('H' shape): Color=7 (Orange), Top-Left=(4, 5), Size=5x3. Offsets: `[(0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2)]`\n    *   Grid Size: 23x28\n    *   Output Tiling: Step=4.\n        *   j=0: Input 'H' pattern tiled O, O, M, O, O, M... Last full pattern at (4, 25).\n        *   j>0: Fixed '8' pattern tiled only at i=2, 5, ..., using M. Last full patterns at (20, 13) and (20, 25).\n\nThe `fixed_pattern_shape` (the '8') offsets relative to its top-left are consistently `[(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]`.\nThe `alternate_color` is consistently 6 (Magenta).\nThe `step_size` is consistently 4.\n\n**Revised Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Record its shape as a list of relative (row, column) offsets (`input_pattern_shape`), its color (`original_color`), and the row/column of its top-left pixel (`r0`, `c0`).\n2.  Define a fixed '8' pattern shape using relative offsets: `fixed_pattern_shape = [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]`.\n3.  Define the `alternate_color` (magenta=6) and the `step_size` (4).\n4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.\n5.  Iterate through tile indices `j` (rows) starting from 0 upwards. For each `j`, iterate through tile indices `i` (columns) starting from 0 upwards.\n6.  Calculate the potential top-left corner `(r, c)` for the tile at `(i, j)`: `r = r0 + step_size * j`, `c = c0 + step_size * i`.\n7.  Check if the calculated corner `(r, c)` is already outside the grid bounds (e.g., `r >= grid_height` or `c >= grid_width`). If `c >= grid_width`, stop iterating `i` for the current `j` and move to the next `j`. If `r >= grid_height`, stop iterating `j` altogether.\n8.  Determine the pattern shape and color to use for this `(i, j)` position:\n    a.  If `j == 0` (original row):\n        i.  Set `shape_to_draw = input_pattern_shape`.\n        ii. Set `color_to_use = alternate_color` if `i % 3 == 2`, otherwise set `color_to_use = original_color`.\n        iii. Proceed to draw this pattern.\n    b.  If `j > 0` (subsequent rows):\n        i.

If `i % 3 != 2`: Do not draw anything for this `(i, j)` position; continue to the next `i`.\n9.  If a pattern needs to be drawn (based on step 8): For each relative offset `(dr, dc)` in the `shape_to_draw`:\n    a.  Calculate the absolute pixel coordinates: `pr = r + dr`, `pc = c + dc`.\n    b.  Check if `(pr, pc)` is within the bounds of the output grid (`0 <= pr < grid_height` and `0 <= pc < grid_width`).\n    c.  If it is within bounds, set the pixel `output_grid[pr, pc]` to `color_to_use`.\n10. After iterating through all relevant `(i, j)` positions, the final state of the `output_grid` is the result."
