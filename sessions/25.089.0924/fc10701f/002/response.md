**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation (Maroon replaced by Orange) and the dependence of Red pixel placement on the alignment of Maroon and Orange objects. However, the specific rules for placing Red pixels were inaccurate, leading to errors in all three examples.

*   **Example 1 (Vertical):** The error was in identifying the exact columns for the Red pixels. The Red pixels should appear in the column corresponding to the right edge of the (now Orange) object and the column corresponding to the left edge of the *rightmost* White object on qualifying rows. The previous code attempted this but produced incorrect column indices in the output, suggesting an implementation bug or slightly flawed logic about which columns to target.
*   **Examples 2 & 3 (Horizontal):** The error was in determining which pixels turn Red. The initial assumption was that *existing* White pixels *on the shared row(s)* between the objects turned Red. The correct rule involves identifying the *columns* occupied by White objects located *entirely between* the Maroon and Orange objects (regardless of the row these White objects are on), and then placing Red pixels in those columns *on the shared row(s)*, overwriting the background color.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  Refine the definition of "between" for the horizontal case to mean columns strictly between the closest vertical edges of the Maroon and Orange objects.
2.  Modify the horizontal rule to identify *all* White objects *fully* located within these "between columns", collect the columns they occupy, and place Red pixels in these collected columns on the row(s) shared by the Maroon/Orange objects.
3.  Re-verify and potentially correct the implementation of the vertical rule, ensuring Red pixels are placed precisely in the column of the right edge of the Maroon/Orange object and the column of the left edge of the rightmost White object on rows containing at least two White objects.
