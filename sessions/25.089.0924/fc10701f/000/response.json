            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are Magenta (6) as the background, Maroon (9), Orange (7), White (0), and Red (2). Red only appears in the output.\n2.  **Objects:**\n    *   There is always exactly one Maroon (9) object and one Orange (7) object in the input. These objects can be single pixels or small rectangles.\n    *   There are White (0) objects, often appearing as pairs of identical blocks/pixels, either horizontally or vertically aligned with each other.\n    *   The Magenta (6) color forms the background.\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The Magenta background remains unchanged.\n    *   The Maroon (9) object disappears.\n    *   The Orange (7) object moves to occupy the exact location previously held by the Maroon (9) object.\n    *   Red (2) pixels appear in the output. Their placement seems dependent on the relative positions of the Maroon, Orange, and White objects.\n4.  **Spatial Relationships:** The relative alignment (horizontal vs. vertical) of the Maroon and Orange objects appears crucial. The placement of White objects, particularly when they form pairs on the same row(s), also influences the output, specifically the location of the Red pixels.\n\n**Analysis of Alignment and Red Pixel Placement:**\n\n*   **Horizontal Alignment (train_2, train_3):** When the Maroon and Orange objects are on the same row(s), the Red pixels replace any White pixels found *between* the column span of the Maroon object and the column span of the Orange object, but *only* on the shared row(s).\n*   **Vertical Alignment (train_1):** When the Maroon and Orange objects are in the same column(s), the Red pixels appear on rows that contain pairs of horizontally separated White blocks. Specifically, Red pixels appear in two columns on these rows: the column corresponding to the right edge of the Maroon/Orange objects and the column corresponding to the left edge of the *rightmost* White block on that row. These Red pixels replace the background Magenta pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

For each shared row, iterate through the columns strictly *between* the minimum and maximum column indices.\n    d.
