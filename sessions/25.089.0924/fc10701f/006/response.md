**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code successfully handled the vertical alignment case (train_1) but failed on the horizontal alignment cases (train_2 and train_3). The errors in the horizontal cases stemmed from an incorrect rule for placing the Red (2) pixels. The original assumption was that Red pixels *replace* White pixels located between the Maroon and Orange objects. However, the failed examples show that Red pixels are *added* (replacing the background Magenta) on the shared rows, in columns that are both between the objects *and* contain White pixels somewhere else in the grid.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the vertical alignment logic remains correct using train_1.
2.  Refine the horizontal alignment logic based on observations from train_2 and train_3. The key insight is that the *columns* containing White pixels matter, not the specific *location* of those White pixels relative to the shared rows.
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this revised understanding.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Replace a Maroon object with an Orange object and add Red pixels based on alignment and White/Magenta pixel locations relative to the objects.
background_color: Magenta (6)

    color: 9
    count: 1
    input_action: Removed
  - type: Orange_Object
    color: 7
    count: 1
    input_action: Relocated
    output_action: Replaces Maroon_Object location
  - type: White_Pixel
    color: 0

    output_action: Remain unchanged.
  - type: Red_Pixel
    color: 2
    count: variable
    input_action: None (does not exist in input)
    output_action: Added based on alignment rules, replacing Magenta pixels.
relationships:
  - type: Alignment
    between: [Maroon_Object, Orange_Object]
    values: [Horizontal, Vertical]
    determination: Based on overlap of bounding box rows/columns. If rows are identical span -> Horizontal. If columns are identical span -> Vertical. If only rows overlap -> Horizontal. If only columns overlap -> Vertical. If both overlap but spans differ -> Horizontal (default/observed).
    effect: Determines the rule for placing Red_Pixels
  - type: Position
    of: White_Pixels
    effect_horizontal: The set of all column indices containing any White pixel determines potential columns for Red pixels.
    effect_vertical: Rows containing >= 2 distinct horizontal White segments trigger Red pixel placement.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the coordinates of all Maroon (9) pixels and all Orange (7) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Determine the bounding boxes for the Maroon and Orange objects.
3.  Determine the primary alignment (Horizontal or Vertical) based on the bounding boxes:
    *   If the min/max rows are identical, alignment is Horizontal.
    *   Else if the min/max columns are identical, alignment is Vertical.
    *   Else if rows overlap and columns do not, alignment is Horizontal.
    *   Else if columns overlap and rows do not, alignment is Vertical.
    *   Else (if both overlap but spans are not identical), alignment is Horizontal.
4.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
5.  Clear the original locations: Change the color of the original Maroon pixels and the original Orange pixels in the *output* grid to the background color (Magenta, 6).
6.  Relocate Orange: Change the color of the pixels in the *output* grid corresponding to the *original* Maroon coordinates to Orange (7).
7.  **If Horizontal Alignment:**
    a.  Identify the row indices shared by the Maroon and Orange bounding boxes (`shared_rows`).
    b.  Determine the range of column indices strictly *between* the Maroon and Orange bounding boxes (`between_cols`).
    c.  Find the set of all column indices in the *input* grid that contain at least one White (0) pixel (`white_cols`).
    d.  Calculate the intersection of `between_cols` and `white_cols` to get `target_cols`.
    e.  For each row index in `shared_rows` and each column index in `target_cols`, change the pixel in the *output* grid to Red (2).
8.  **If Vertical Alignment:**
    a.  Identify the column indices shared by the Maroon and Orange bounding boxes (`shared_cols`). Determine the leftmost shared column index (`leftmost_shared_col`).
    b.  Iterate through each row index (`r`) of the input grid:
        i.  Find all distinct contiguous horizontal segments of White (0) pixels on row `r` of the *input* grid.
        ii. If there are two or more such segments:
            1.  Find the segment with the largest starting column index (the rightmost segment). Let its starting column be `rightmost_segment_start_col`.
            2.  Calculate the column index immediately to the left: `col_left_of_rightmost = rightmost_segment_start_col - 1`.
            3.  Change the pixel in the *output* grid at (`r`, `leftmost_shared_col`) to Red (2).
            4.  Change the pixel in the *output* grid at (`r`, `col_left_of_rightmost`) to Red (2), if this column index is valid (>= 0).
9.  Return the modified output grid.
