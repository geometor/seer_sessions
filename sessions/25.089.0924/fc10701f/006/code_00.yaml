task_description: Replace a Maroon object with an Orange object and add Red pixels based on alignment and White/Magenta pixel locations relative to the objects.
background_color: Magenta (6)
objects:
  - type: Maroon_Object
    color: 9
    count: 1
    input_action: Removed
  - type: Orange_Object
    color: 7
    count: 1
    input_action: Relocated
    output_action: Replaces Maroon_Object location
  - type: White_Pixel
    color: 0
    count: variable
    input_action: Used to determine Red pixel locations. Unchanged otherwise.
    output_action: Remain unchanged.
  - type: Red_Pixel
    color: 2
    count: variable
    input_action: None (does not exist in input)
    output_action: Added based on alignment rules, replacing Magenta pixels.
relationships:
  - type: Alignment
    between: [Maroon_Object, Orange_Object]
    values: [Horizontal, Vertical]
    determination: Based on overlap of bounding box rows/columns. If rows are identical span -> Horizontal. If columns are identical span -> Vertical. If only rows overlap -> Horizontal. If only columns overlap -> Vertical. If both overlap but spans differ -> Horizontal (default/observed).
    effect: Determines the rule for placing Red_Pixels
  - type: Position
    of: White_Pixels
    effect_horizontal: The set of all column indices containing any White pixel determines potential columns for Red pixels.
    effect_vertical: Rows containing >= 2 distinct horizontal White segments trigger Red pixel placement.
