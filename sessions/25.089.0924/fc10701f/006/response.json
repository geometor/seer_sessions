            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code successfully handled the vertical alignment case (train_1) but failed on the horizontal alignment cases (train_2 and train_3). The errors in the horizontal cases stemmed from an incorrect rule for placing the Red (2) pixels. The original assumption was that Red pixels *replace* White pixels located between the Maroon and Orange objects. However, the failed examples show that Red pixels are *added* (replacing the background Magenta) on the shared rows, in columns that are both between the objects *and* contain White pixels somewhere else in the grid.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the vertical alignment logic remains correct using train_1.\n2.  Refine the horizontal alignment logic based on observations from train_2 and train_3. The key insight is that the *columns* containing White pixels matter, not the specific *location* of those White pixels relative to the shared rows.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this revised understanding.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
