task_description: Moves an Orange object to the location of a Maroon object and adds Red pixels based on the relative alignment (Horizontal/Vertical) and the positions of White pixels/objects.
background_color: Magenta (6)
objects:
  - id: Maroon_Object
    color: 9
    count: 1
    input_action: Present
    output_action: Removed (position noted)
  - id: Orange_Object
    color: 7
    count: 1
    input_action: Present
    output_action: Moved to Maroon_Object's original position
  - id: White_Pixel_or_Object
    color: 0
    count: variable
    input_action: Present
    output_action: Some remain, some influence Red placement, some potentially overwritten by Red.
  - id: Red_Pixel
    color: 2
    count: variable
    input_action: Absent
    output_action: Added based on rules
properties:
  - name: BoundingBox
    applies_to: [Maroon_Object, Orange_Object]
    values: [min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col]
  - name: Alignment
    derived_from: BoundingBox overlap and row/column span equality between Maroon_Object and Orange_Object
    values: [Horizontal, Vertical]
  - name: White_Segments_Per_Row
    applies_to: Input grid rows
    values: List of [start_col, end_col] tuples for contiguous White pixels
relationships:
  - type: Relative Position & Alignment
    between: [Maroon_Object, Orange_Object]
    determines: The specific rule (Horizontal or Vertical) for placing Red_Pixels.
  - type: Containment / Proximity
    between: [White_Pixel_or_Object, Maroon_Object, Orange_Object]
    influences: Which Red_Pixel rule is applied and where Red_Pixels appear.
actions:
  - action: Calculate_Bounding_Boxes
    inputs: [Maroon_Object coordinates, Orange_Object coordinates]
    outputs: Bounding boxes
  - action: Determine_Alignment
    inputs: Bounding boxes
    outputs: Alignment type (Horizontal/Vertical)
  - action: Copy_Grid
    inputs: Input grid
    outputs: Initial output grid
  - action: Clear_Object_Locations
    inputs: [Initial output grid, Maroon coordinates, Orange coordinates]
    outputs: Grid with original objects removed (replaced by background Magenta)
  - action: Relocate_Orange_Object
    inputs: [Grid after clearing, Maroon coordinates]
    outputs: Grid with Orange color placed at Maroon's original location
  - action: Apply_Red_Pixel_Rule
    inputs: [Grid after relocation, Alignment type, Input grid (for reference), Object BBoxes]
    outputs: Final output grid with Red pixels added
