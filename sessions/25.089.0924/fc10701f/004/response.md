**General Assessment:**

The primary error was a runtime failure due to a missing dependency (`skimage`). This occurred because the second code iteration introduced a dependency on `skimage.measure.label` to implement `find_objects`, which was used in an attempt to refine the horizontal alignment rule. However, upon closer re-examination of the examples, this dependency is unnecessary. The logic for both horizontal and vertical alignment cases can be implemented using `numpy` and basic Python iteration.

The strategy is to:
1.  Remove the `skimage` dependency and the `find_objects` function.
2.  Refine the alignment detection logic to be robust based on shared rows/columns and overlap.
3.  Re-implement the horizontal alignment rule based on the revised understanding: identify target columns containing white pixels between the objects on *any* shared row, then place red pixels in those columns on *all* shared rows.
4.  Confirm and use the original vertical alignment rule: identify rows with multiple white segments, find the rightmost shared column of Maroon/Orange and the start column of the rightmost white segment, and place red pixels at these two column indices on the identified rows.
5.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this refined understanding.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

We need to precisely define the object locations, alignment, and the specific coordinates affected by the red pixel placement rules for each example.

**Analysis Error:** The code execution output reveals discrepancies between the `expected_red_coords` calculated by my refined rules and the `actual_red_coords` found in the example outputs.

*   **Train 1 (Vertical):** Expected: `[(3, 7), (3, 8), (5, 7), (5, 8), (8, 7), (8, 8)]`. Actual: `[(3, 6), (3, 7), (5, 6), (5, 7), (8, 6), (8, 7)]`. The actual red pixels are one column to the left of what my rule predicted. It seems the rule should use the `leftmost_shared_col` (which is 6) and the column *left of* the rightmost white segment's start (`right_white_left_col - 1`, which is 7). This matches the logic in the *second* code attempt, which I initially dismissed. Let's re-verify that logic.
    *   Leftmost shared col: `max(maroon_min_c, orange_min_c)` = max(6, 6) = 6.
    *   Rightmost white starts at col 8. Column left of it is 7.
    *   So, red pixels should be at columns 6 and 7 on rows 3, 5, 8. This matches the `actual_red_coords`. The vertical rule needs correction in the natural language program.

*   **Train 2 (Horizontal):** Expected: `[]`. Actual: `[(4, 3), (4, 5)]`. My calculation of `target_cols_from_white` was wrong in the tool code. Let's re-trace: Shared row 4. Between cols 2-6. Input row 4 is `[6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6]`. White pixels in cols 2-6 are at index 3 and 5. So `target_cols = {3, 5}`. Expected red should be `[(4, 3), (4, 5)]`. The tool code had a bug. The logic seems correct, but the implementation in the analysis code was flawed.

*   **Train 3 (Horizontal):** Expected: `[]`. Actual: `[(7, 7), (7, 10), (8, 7), (8, 10)]`. Similar bug in the tool code analysis. Let's re-trace: Shared rows 7, 8. Between cols 6-11.
    *   Input row 7 `[... 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0 ...]` has white at cols 7 and 10 within the range 6-11.
    *   Input row 8 `[... 9, 9, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6 ...]` has no white in cols 6-11.
    *   Combined `target_cols = {7, 10}` based on white pixels found on *any* shared row within the 'between' range.
    *   Expected red coords: `[(7, 7), (7, 10), (8, 7), (8, 10)]`. This matches the actual output. Again, the rule is correct, but the analysis code failed to implement it correctly.

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The natural language rules derived just before the code execution seem correct, but the vertical rule needed the specific column indices clarified (leftmost shared, and left-of-rightmost-white). The horizontal rule holds. The `skimage` dependency is not needed.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Find all coordinates of the unique Maroon (9) object (`maroon_coords`) and the unique Orange (7) object (`orange_coords`) in the `input_grid`.
3.  Calculate the bounding boxes (`min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c`) for both the Maroon and Orange objects based on their coordinates in the `input_grid`.
4.  Determine the alignment:
    a.  If the Maroon and Orange objects have the exact same row span (`min_r` and `max_r` are identical), alignment is **Horizontal**.
    b.  Else if they have the exact same column span (`min_c` and `max_c` are identical), alignment is **Vertical**.
    c.  Else if their bounding boxes overlap in rows but not columns, alignment is **Horizontal**.
    d.  Else if their bounding boxes overlap in columns but not rows, alignment is **Vertical**.
    e.  Else if their bounding boxes overlap in both rows and columns (but spans are not identical), alignment is **Horizontal**.
5.  Clear the original locations of *both* the Maroon and Orange objects in the `output_grid` by setting them to the background color (Magenta, 6).
6.  Place the Orange (7) color in the `output_grid` at the coordinates originally occupied by the Maroon object (`maroon_coords`).
7.  **If Alignment is Horizontal:**
    a.  Identify the rows shared by the Maroon and Orange bounding boxes (`shared_rows`).
    b.  Determine the column range strictly *between* the objects: `between_start_col = min(maroon_max_c, orange_max_c) + 1`, `between_end_col = max(maroon_min_c, orange_min_c)`.
    c.  Create an empty set `target_cols`.
    d.  Iterate through each row `r` in `shared_rows` and each column `c` from `between_start_col` up to (but not including) `between_end_col`. If the pixel at `input_grid[r, c]` is White (0), add `c` to `target_cols`.
    e.  Iterate through each row `r` in `shared_rows` and each column `c` in `target_cols`. Set `output_grid[r, c]` to Red (2).
8.  **If Alignment is Vertical:**
    a.  Identify the columns shared by the Maroon and Orange bounding boxes (`shared_cols`). Determine the `leftmost_shared_col` (minimum value in `shared_cols`).
    b.  Iterate through each row index `r` of the `input_grid`.
    c.  For row `r`, find all contiguous horizontal segments of White (0) pixels.
    d.  If row `r` contains two or more distinct White segments:
        i.  Find the rightmost White segment (the one with the largest `start_col`).
        ii. Calculate `col_left_of_rightmost_white = rightmost_segment_start_col - 1`.
        iii. Set `output_grid[r, leftmost_shared_col]` to Red (2).
        iv. If `col_left_of_rightmost_white` is a valid column index (>= 0), set `output_grid[r, col_left_of_rightmost_white]` to Red (2).
9.  Return the final `output_grid`.
