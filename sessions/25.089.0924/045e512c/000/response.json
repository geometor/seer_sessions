In each input grid, there appears to be one \"main\" or \"anchor\" object that is a single contiguous block of one color. The other colors might represent single pixels or multiple disconnected pixels of the same color.\n*   **Output Grids:** The anchor object from the input remains unchanged in the output grid in the same position. The other colored elements from the input are replaced by patterns drawn in the output.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying the anchor, keeping it, and then for each other color present in the input:\n    1.  Counting the number of pixels (N) of that color.\n    2.  Determining a specific 3x3 shape based on N (and potentially the relative positions of the pixels if N=2).\n    3.  Determining the number of copies (K) of that shape to draw (usually K=N, but K=3 if N=1).\n    4.  Drawing K copies of the shape using the original color, placed in a line radiating away from the anchor object, starting near the original pixel locations, with a fixed spacing (seems like 4 units).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
