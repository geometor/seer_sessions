task_type: extraction
elements:
  - type: grid
    role: input
    properties:
      - contains multiple colors
      - has a dominant background color
      - contains various small patterns/objects
      - contains exactly one instance of a specific target pattern
  - type: grid
    role: output
    properties:
      - size: 3x3
      - represents the target pattern extracted from the input
target_pattern:
  type: subgrid
  properties:
    - size: 3x3
    - structure: a central pixel of color 'A' surrounded by 8 pixels of color 'B'
    - constraints:
        - color 'A' is different from color 'B'
        - color 'A' is different from the input grid's background color
        - color 'B' is different from the input grid's background color
relationship: The output grid is a direct copy of the unique 3x3 target pattern found within the input grid.
action: Identify and extract the unique 3x3 target pattern from the input grid.
