The corresponding output is always a small 3x3 grid. By visually comparing the input and output grids in each example, I observe that the output 3x3 grid exists as an exact subgrid within the larger input grid. The key seems to be identifying which specific 3x3 subgrid from the input corresponds to the output.\n\nLooking closer at the structure of the output grids and their corresponding locations in the input grids:\n- The output 3x3 grid always has a central pixel of one color and all 8 surrounding pixels (including diagonals) are of a single, different color.\n- Both the center color and the surrounding border color are distinct from the main background color of the input grid.\n- In each example, there appears to be only one such 3x3 pattern within the input grid that fits this description.\n\n**Facts:**\n"

Note the color of the central pixel (`center_color`).\n    b.  Check if all 8 surrounding pixels (neighbors, including diagonals) are of the *same* color (`border_color`).\n    c.  Verify that `center_color` is not equal to `border_color`.\n    d.  Verify that `center_color` is not equal to the background color identified in step 1.\n    e.  Verify that `border_color` is not equal to the background color identified in step 1.\n4.  **Extract and Output:** If all conditions (3a-3e) are true for a subgrid, this is the target pattern. Extract this 3x3 subgrid and present it as the output. Since the examples suggest uniqueness, stop searching once the pattern is found."
