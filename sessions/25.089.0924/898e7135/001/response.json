For each object, determine its color, area (number of pixels), and bounding box.\n2.  **Filter Noise:** Remove objects with an area of 1 pixel (\"noise\").\n3.  **Find Largest Object:** Among the remaining objects, identify the one with the largest area (L). If there's a tie in area, the one encountered first (e.g., by top-left coordinate) is chosen. Note its color (C_bg) and the dimensions of its bounding box (Hl, Wl).\n4.  **Identify Kept Objects:** All other non-noise objects (K_i) are designated as \"kept\" objects, which will be drawn onto the output grid.\n5.  **Calculate Output Size:** Determine the output grid dimensions (H_out, W_out) based on the largest object's bounding box dimensions (Hl, Wl) using the following rule:\n    *   H_out = max(1, 2 * Hl if Hl % 2 == 0 else 2 * (Hl - 1))\n    *   W_out = max(1, 2 * Wl if Wl % 2 == 0 else 2 * (Wl - 1))\n6.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create an output grid of size (H_out, W_out) and fill it entirely with the background color C_bg.\n7.  **Determine Kept Objects' Combined Bounding Box:** If there are any kept objects (K_i), calculate the minimal bounding box (KBB_all) that encloses all of them. Find its top-left corner (rk_all, ck_all). If there are no kept objects, the output grid remains as initialized.\n8.  **Draw Kept Objects:** For each kept object K_i:\n    *   Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to K_i in the input grid.\n    *   Calculate the pixel's position relative to the top-left corner of the combined kept objects' bounding box: `rel_r = r - rk_all`, `rel_c = c - ck_all`.\n    *   Calculate the target output position by adding a fixed offset of (2, 2): `out_r = rel_r + 2`, `out_c = rel_c + 2`.\n    *   If the calculated `(out_r, out_c)` coordinates are within the bounds of the output grid, set the pixel at `output_grid[out_r, out_c]` to the color of K_i.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of non-background (0) colors in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an object\n              and contains 'color', 'pixels' (set of (r, c) tuples),\n              'area', and 'bbox' (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                obj_pixels = set()\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                min_r, min_c = r, c\n                max_r, max_c = r, c\n                \n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    obj_pixels.add((row, col))\n                    min_r = min(min_r, row)\n                    min_c = min(min_c, col)\n                    max_r = max(max_r, row)\n                    max_c = max(max_c, col)\n                    \n                    # Check neighbors (4-connectivity)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           not visited[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == color:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                            \n                objects.append({\n                    'color': color,\n                    'pixels': obj_pixels,\n                    'area': len(obj_pixels),\n                    'bbox': (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)\n                })\n                \n    # Sort objects primarily by area (descending), then by position (top-left)\n    objects.sort(key=lambda o: (-o['area'], o['bbox'][0], o['bbox'][1]))\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # 1.
