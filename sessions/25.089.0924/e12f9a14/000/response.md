Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Background Color:** The dominant color in all input and output grids is azure (8). This appears to function as the background or empty space.
2.  **Objects/Shapes:** In the input grids, there are distinct shapes made of various colors (green, maroon, blue, yellow, magenta, red, orange). Some shapes are enclosed by a green (3) border or frame. Other colored shapes exist independently.
3.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation seems to involve "projecting" or "extending" colors outwards from their original positions. The output grid retains the original shapes, but the azure background pixels adjacent (horizontally and vertically) to non-azure pixels are filled with the color of that adjacent non-azure pixel. This projection continues outwards in straight lines (horizontal and vertical) until it hits another non-azure pixel or the edge of the grid.
4.  **Frame Invariance:** The green (3) frames, where present, remain unchanged in the output. The projection seems to happen from the colors *inside* the frame as well as from colored pixels *outside* any frame.
5.  **Color Preservation:** The original colors of the shapes are preserved and used for the outward projection. No new colors are introduced, and existing colors don't change, except for the azure background being overwritten.
6.  **Projection Rule:** The projection happens strictly horizontally and vertically. Diagonal projection does not occur. A projection line stops immediately upon encountering any pixel that is not azure (8).

**Facts:**


```yaml
InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - background_color: azure (8)
    - contains: objects
Objects:
  Types:
    - Frame:
        Properties:
          - color: green (3)
          - shape: rectangular or irregular contour
          - function: encloses other colored pixels
    - Content:
        Properties:
          - color: various (maroon(9), blue(1), yellow(4), red(2), orange(7), magenta(6))
          - location: can be inside a Frame or standalone
          - shape: various (often rectangular blocks or single pixels)
Transformation:
  Action: ProjectColorOutwards
  SourcePixels: all non-azure (8) pixels in the input grid
  TargetPixels: azure (8) pixels in the input grid
  Rule:
    - For each SourcePixel:
        - Project its color horizontally (left and right) onto adjacent TargetPixels.
        - Project its color vertically (up and down) onto adjacent TargetPixels.
        - Continue projection in each direction until a non-TargetPixel (i.e., any color other than azure) or the grid boundary is encountered.
  OutputGrid:
    - Retains all original non-azure pixels from the input grid.
    - Azure pixels that were overwritten by the projection now have the color of the source pixel that projected onto them.
Relationships:
  - Containment: Green Frames contain Content pixels.
  - Adjacency: The projection rule depends on horizontal and vertical adjacency.
  - Stopping Condition: Projection stops at non-azure pixels or grid boundaries.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are *not* the background color (azure, 8). Call these "source pixels".
3.  For each source pixel found in step 2:
    a.  Determine its color (`source_color`) and position (`row`, `col`).
    b.  **Project Left:** Iterate from `col - 1` down to 0. If the pixel at (`row`, `current_col`) in the *output* grid is azure (8), change its color to `source_color`. If it's not azure (8), stop projecting left for this source pixel.
    c.  **Project Right:** Iterate from `col + 1` up to the grid width minus 1. If the pixel at (`row`, `current_col`) in the *output* grid is azure (8), change its color to `source_color`. If it's not azure (8), stop projecting right for this source pixel.
    d.  **Project Up:** Iterate from `row - 1` down to 0. If the pixel at (`current_row`, `col`) in the *output* grid is azure (8), change its color to `source_color`. If it's not azure (8), stop projecting up for this source pixel.
    e.  **Project Down:** Iterate from `row + 1` up to the grid height minus 1. If the pixel at (`current_row`, `col`) in the *output* grid is azure (8), change its color to `source_color`. If it's not azure (8), stop projecting down for this source pixel.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
