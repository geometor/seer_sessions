The specific color being modified changes between examples, but the result of the modification is always yellow (4). The background color appears to be white (0). In each example, there's a primary color other than white (0) and red (2): azure (8) in example 1, blue (1) in example 2, and green (3) in example 3. It seems these primary colors are the ones targeted for change when they are adjacent (including diagonally) to a red (2) pixel.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
