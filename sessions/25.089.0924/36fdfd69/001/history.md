*   **Perception**: The task involves modifying pixels based on their adjacency to red (2) pixels. The specific color being modified changes between examples, but the result of the modification is always yellow (4). The background color appears to be white (0). In each example, there's a primary color other than white (0) and red (2): azure (8) in example 1, blue (1) in example 2, and green (3) in example 3. It seems these primary colors are the ones targeted for change when they are adjacent (including diagonally) to a red (2) pixel.

*   **YAML Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_description: Modify pixels adjacent to red pixels based on the dominant non-background, non-red color in the grid.
    
    elements:
      - element: grid
        description: A 2D array of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9.
      - element: pixel
        description: A single cell in the grid with a specific color value.
      - element: background_color
        value: 0 (white)
        description: The most frequent color, usually representing empty space.
      - element: trigger_color
        value: 2 (red)
        description: The color that triggers a change in adjacent pixels.
      - element: target_color
        description: The color that gets changed if adjacent to the trigger_color. This color varies per example but is the unique non-background, non-trigger color present in the input grid.
        values_in_examples:
          - 8 (azure) in example 1
          - 1 (blue) in example 2
          - 3 (green) in example 3
      - element: result_color
        value: 4 (yellow)
        description: The color that replaces the target_color when the condition is met.
      - element: adjacency
        type: Moore neighborhood (8 surrounding cells, including diagonals)
        description: The condition for change depends on a pixel being adjacent to a trigger_color pixel.
    
    transformations:
      - action: identify_target_color
        input: input_grid
        output: target_color_value
        description: Find the single color present in the input grid that is not white (0) and not red (2).
      - action: modify_pixels
        input: input_grid, target_color_value
        output: output_grid
        description: Create the output grid by copying the input. Then, iterate through the input grid. For each red (2) pixel found, check its 8 neighbours. If a neighbour in the input grid has the identified target_color_value, change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to yellow (4). All other pixels retain their original color.
    
    relationships:
      - relationship: adjacency_trigger
        element1: trigger_color pixel (red 2)
        element2: target_color pixel
        condition: element2 is adjacent (including diagonally) to element1 in the input grid.
        effect: element2's corresponding pixel in the output grid becomes result_color (yellow 4).
      - relationship: color_preservation
        elements: all pixels not meeting the adjacency_trigger condition
        effect: The color of these pixels remains unchanged from input to output.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the 'target' color: Scan the input grid to find the single color that exists besides white (0) and red (2).
    3.  Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid using its row and column index.
    4.  If the current pixel in the input grid is red (2):
        a.  Examine the 8 pixels directly and diagonally adjacent to the current pixel (its Moore neighborhood).
        b.  For each adjacent pixel:
            i.  Check if the adjacent pixel is within the grid boundaries.
            ii. Check if the color of this adjacent pixel in the *input* grid is equal to the identified 'target' color.
            iii. If both conditions are true, change the color of the corresponding adjacent pixel in the *output* grid to yellow (4).
    5.  Return the modified output grid. Pixels that were not red (2) and pixels that were adjacent to red (2) but did not match the 'target' color remain unchanged from the input grid.
