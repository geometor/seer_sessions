"""
Identify the unique color in the input grid that is not white (0) or red (2). 
This is the 'target' color.
Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
Iterate through the input grid. If a pixel is red (2), examine its 8 neighbors (Moore neighborhood).
If any neighbor in the input grid has the 'target' color, change the corresponding neighbor pixel in the output grid to yellow (4).
Pixels that are not neighbors of red pixels, or neighbors that are not the 'target' color, remain unchanged.
