The results show that the transformed outputs consistently included larger areas than expected, often encompassing multiple disconnected groups of non-background pixels or incorrectly identifying the primary object. The correct approach appears to involve identifying *all* pixels that are *not* the background color and finding the minimal bounding box that contains *all* of them, regardless of contiguity or size. The background color is correctly identified as the most frequent color.\n\n*   **Metrics Gathering:**\n\n    Let's analyze Example 1 to confirm the hypothesis.\n    Input grid dimensions: 20 rows, 25 columns.\n    Colors: Green (3) and Yellow (4).\n    Expected Output dimensions: 11 rows, 12 columns.\n    Previous Transformed Output dimensions: 20 rows, 16 columns.\n"
