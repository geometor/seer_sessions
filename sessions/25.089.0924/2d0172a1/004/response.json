            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core task elements: background color, object color, and extracting a bounding box. However, the code implementation failed because it calculated the bounding box encompassing *all* pixels of the object color across the entire input grid. The example results clearly show that the output corresponds to the bounding box of only a *specific subset* of the object pixels present in the input.\n\nComparing the expected outputs with the inputs suggests the transformation focuses on a single, specific \"object\" or \"pattern\" formed by the non-background pixels. The most plausible hypothesis is that the task requires identifying the **largest contiguous region (connected component)** of the non-background color and then extracting the minimal bounding box containing only that largest region. The previous code failed because it included potentially multiple, separate regions of the object color in its bounding box calculation.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Refine the object identification step to find connected components of the non-background color.\n2.  Determine a criterion for selecting the \"correct\" component (likely the one with the most pixels).\n3.  Calculate the bounding box based *only* on the pixels belonging to the selected component.\n4.  Extract the subgrid corresponding to this bounding box.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's gather metrics focusing on the connected components of the non-background color. We need to:\n1.  Identify the background color (most frequent).\n2.  Identify the object color (the other color present).\n3.  Find all connected components (regions where object-colored pixels are adjacent horizontally or vertically) of the object color.\n4.  Count the number of pixels in each component.\n5.  Find the bounding box of the largest component.\n6.  Compare the dimensions of this bounding box with the expected output dimensions.\n\n"
