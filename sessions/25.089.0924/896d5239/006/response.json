            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempt implemented a flood-fill (BFS) algorithm starting from the grid's border, marking all non-green (3) pixels reachable without crossing green pixels. It then intended to change all *unreachable* non-green pixels to azure (8). However, the test results indicated that the code produced output identical to the input, suggesting either a fundamental flaw in the execution or reporting of the test, or a misunderstanding in the code's final step.\n\nAssuming the core idea (identifying regions enclosed by green and filling them) is correct based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs, the likely issue was in the implementation details or the test feedback. The comparison between the provided `input` and `expected output` clearly shows a \"flood fill\" pattern where regions completely surrounded by green (3) pixels are filled with azure (8), *unless* the pixel itself was originally green. Pixels connected to the border via a path not crossing green pixels retain their original color.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the description and program based on the *intended* logic confirmed by the *expected outputs*, assuming the previous code's execution or reporting was faulty. We will verify that the logic correctly handles:\n1.  Identifying the exterior region (connected to the border without crossing green).\n2.  Identifying interior regions (not connected to the exterior).\n3.  Changing only the non-green pixels within the interior regions to azure (8).\n4.  Leaving green pixels and all exterior pixels unchanged.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nWe will compare the input and expected output for each training example to quantify the transformation.\n\n"
