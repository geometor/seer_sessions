            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code execution failed unexpectedly, producing the input grid as the output for all examples, despite the logic appearing sound for identifying and filling enclosed regions. The core transformation involves identifying pixels enclosed by green walls (color 3) and changing their color to azure (8), while leaving the green walls themselves and any pixels reachable from the grid border unchanged.\n\nThe failure suggests either a subtle bug in the implementation (perhaps related to the BFS or the final filling loop conditions) or an issue with the execution environment/test harness used previously. The most likely logical error would be incorrectly marking enclosed cells as reachable, or incorrectly applying the condition for filling.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-verify the core logic:** The algorithm should use a flood fill (like BFS) starting from all non-green border pixels. Mark all reachable non-green pixels. Iterate through the grid; any pixel that was *not* marked as reachable *and* is *not* originally green (3) should be changed to azure (8).\n2.  **Analyze Metrics:** Calculate precise metrics for each example to confirm the pattern of change (number of pixels changed, locations, original colors).\n3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language program to accurately reflect this verified logic, paying close attention to the condition that only *non-green* unreachable cells are filled.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n"
