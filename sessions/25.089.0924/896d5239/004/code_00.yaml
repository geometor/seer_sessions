objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels with color values.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0-9.
      - location: (row, column) coordinates.
      - reachability: Boolean indicating if reachable from border via non-green path.
  - type: boundary_wall
    definition: Set of pixels with color green (3). They act as barriers.
  - type: exterior_region
    definition: Set of connected non-green pixels reachable from the grid border without crossing a green (3) pixel.
  - type: interior_region
    definition: Set of connected non-green pixels not reachable from the grid border without crossing a green (3) pixel (i.e., enclosed).
properties:
  - green_pixels: Act as impassable barriers for connectivity analysis. Remain unchanged in the output.
  - non_green_pixels: Can be part of the exterior or interior regions.
  - border_pixels: Pixels on the outermost rows/columns of the grid.
actions:
  - copy_grid: Create a mutable copy of the input grid for the output.
  - identify_reachability: Perform a flood fill (e.g., BFS) starting from all non-green border pixels. Mark all visited pixels (which must be non-green) as 'reachable'.
  - fill_interior: Iterate through all pixels in the grid. If a pixel was *not* marked as 'reachable' AND its original color was *not* green (3), change its color to azure (8) in the output grid.
relationships:
  - connectivity: A non-green pixel `A` is connected to another non-green pixel `B` if a path exists between them consisting only of adjacent non-green pixels.
  - reachability_from_border: A pixel is reachable if it's non-green and connected to any non-green border pixel.
  - enclosure: Green (3) pixels form boundaries that may prevent non-green pixels from being reachable from the border.
transformation:
  - rule: Find all non-green pixels that are enclosed by green (3) walls (i.e., not reachable from the border via paths of non-green pixels). Change the color of these enclosed, originally non-green pixels to azure (8). All other pixels (green walls, reachable non-green pixels) retain their original color.
metrics_summary:
  - All examples involve changing originally white (0) or blue (1) pixels to azure (8).
  - Green (3) pixels are never changed.
  - The number of changed pixels varies (15, 15, 19).
  - Grid dimensions vary across examples.
