## General Assessment

The previous code execution failed unexpectedly, producing the input grid as the output for all examples, despite the logic appearing sound for identifying and filling enclosed regions. The core transformation involves identifying pixels enclosed by green walls (color 3) and changing their color to azure (8), while leaving the green walls themselves and any pixels reachable from the grid border unchanged.

The failure suggests either a subtle bug in the implementation (perhaps related to the BFS or the final filling loop conditions) or an issue with the execution environment/test harness used previously. The most likely logical error would be incorrectly marking enclosed cells as reachable, or incorrectly applying the condition for filling.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-verify the core logic:** The algorithm should use a flood fill (like BFS) starting from all non-green border pixels. Mark all reachable non-green pixels. Iterate through the grid; any pixel that was *not* marked as reachable *and* is *not* originally green (3) should be changed to azure (8).
2.  **Analyze Metrics:** Calculate precise metrics for each example to confirm the pattern of change (number of pixels changed, locations, original colors).
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language program to accurately reflect this verified logic, paying close attention to the condition that only *non-green* unreachable cells are filled.

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
task_type: region_fill_bounded
color_palette: [0, 1, 3, 8] # white, blue, green, azure
input_colors_involved: [0, 1, 3] # white, blue, green
output_colors_involved: [0, 1, 3, 8] # white, blue, green, azure
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels with color values.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0-9.
      - location: (row, column) coordinates.
      - reachability: Boolean indicating if reachable from border via non-green path.
  - type: boundary_wall
    definition: Set of pixels with color green (3). They act as barriers.
  - type: exterior_region
    definition: Set of connected non-green pixels reachable from the grid border without crossing a green (3) pixel.
  - type: interior_region
    definition: Set of connected non-green pixels not reachable from the grid border without crossing a green (3) pixel (i.e., enclosed).
properties:
  - green_pixels: Act as impassable barriers for connectivity analysis. Remain unchanged in the output.
  - non_green_pixels: Can be part of the exterior or interior regions.
  - border_pixels: Pixels on the outermost rows/columns of the grid.
actions:
  - copy_grid: Create a mutable copy of the input grid for the output.
  - identify_reachability: Perform a flood fill (e.g., BFS) starting from all non-green border pixels. Mark all visited pixels (which must be non-green) as 'reachable'.
  - fill_interior: Iterate through all pixels in the grid. If a pixel was *not* marked as 'reachable' AND its original color was *not* green (3), change its color to azure (8) in the output grid.
relationships:
  - connectivity: A non-green pixel `A` is connected to another non-green pixel `B` if a path exists between them consisting only of adjacent non-green pixels.
  - reachability_from_border: A pixel is reachable if it's non-green and connected to any non-green border pixel.
  - enclosure: Green (3) pixels form boundaries that may prevent non-green pixels from being reachable from the border.
transformation:
  - rule: Find all non-green pixels that are enclosed by green (3) walls (i.e., not reachable from the border via paths of non-green pixels). Change the color of these enclosed, originally non-green pixels to azure (8). All other pixels (green walls, reachable non-green pixels) retain their original color.
metrics_summary:
  - All examples involve changing originally white (0) or blue (1) pixels to azure (8).
  - Green (3) pixels are never changed.
  - The number of changed pixels varies (15, 15, 19).
  - Grid dimensions vary across examples.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create an output grid by making an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Define the 'wall' color as green (3) and the 'fill' color as azure (8).
3.  Create a boolean grid, `reachable`, of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized to all `False`. This will track pixels reachable from the border.
4.  Initialize a queue for a Breadth-First Search (BFS).
5.  Iterate through all pixels on the border (top row, bottom row, left column, right column) of the input grid.
6.  For each border pixel `(r, c)`:
    a.  If the color of the pixel `input_grid[r, c]` is *not* the wall color (green, 3), mark `reachable[r, c]` as `True` and add the coordinates `(r, c)` to the BFS queue.
7.  While the BFS queue is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue a coordinate `(r, c)`.
    b.  Examine its four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right): `(nr, nc)`.
    c.  For each neighbor `(nr, nc)`:
        i.   Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries.
        ii.  Check if the neighbor has *not* already been marked as reachable (`reachable[nr, nc]` is `False`).
        iii. Check if the neighbor's color in the *input* grid (`input_grid[nr, nc]`) is *not* the wall color (green, 3).
        iv.  If all conditions (i, ii, iii) are true, mark `reachable[nr, nc]` as `True` and enqueue `(nr, nc)`.
8.  After the BFS is complete, iterate through every pixel `(r, c)` in the grid (from row 0 to height-1, column 0 to width-1).
9.  For each pixel `(r, c)`:
    a.  Check if the pixel was *not* marked as reachable (`reachable[r, c]` is `False`).
    b.  Check if the pixel's original color in the *input* grid (`input_grid[r, c]`) is *not* the wall color (green, 3).
    c.  If *both* conditions (a and b) are true, change the color of the pixel in the *output* grid (`output_grid[r, c]`) to the fill color (azure, 8).
10. Return the modified output grid.
