## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 2D grids of pixels with integer values representing colors.
2.  **Colors:** The key colors involved are white (0), blue (1), green (3), and azure (8). White and blue appear in the input and can be changed. Green (3) acts as a boundary or wall. Azure (8) is the new color introduced in the output.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying regions within the grid and changing the color of pixels within those regions to azure (8).
4.  **Boundary Condition:** The green (3) pixels define the boundaries of the regions to be filled. Specifically, they act as impenetrable walls for a connectivity analysis starting from the grid's border.
5.  **Filling Logic:** Regions (composed of any color, including green) that are not reachable from the grid's border without crossing a green (3) pixel are filled entirely with azure (8). Pixels reachable from the border without crossing a green (3) pixel retain their original color.

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
task_type: fill_region
color_palette: [0, 1, 3, 8] # white, blue, green, azure
input_colors_involved: [0, 1, 3] # white, blue, green
output_colors_involved: [0, 1, 3, 8] # white, blue, green, azure
objects:
  - type: region
    definition: Connected area of pixels.
  - type: boundary
    definition: Pixels with color green (3).
  - type: exterior_region
    definition: Region of non-green pixels connected to the grid border.
  - type: interior_region
    definition: Region of pixels (any color) not connected to the grid border without crossing a green (3) pixel.
properties:
  - green_pixels: act as barriers or walls.
  - non_green_pixels: define pathways for connectivity from the border.
actions:
  - identify_connectivity: Determine which pixels are reachable from the grid border by moving only through non-green pixels.
  - fill_color: Change the color of unreachable pixels to azure (8).
relationships:
  - connectivity: A non-green pixel is connected to the border if a path of non-green pixels exists between them.
  - enclosure: Green pixels enclose regions, preventing non-green connectivity to the border.
transformation:
  - rule: Pixels not reachable from the border via paths of non-green pixels are changed to azure (8). All other pixels retain their original color.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid, which will become the output grid.
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the color green (3). These pixels act as walls.
3.  Initialize a set or grid to keep track of "reachable" pixels, initially empty.
4.  Initialize a queue or stack for a flood fill or Breadth-First Search (BFS) / Depth-First Search (DFS).
5.  Add all non-green pixels located on the border (top, bottom, left, right edges) of the input grid to the queue/stack and mark them as "reachable".
6.  While the queue/stack is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue/pop a pixel `(r, c)`.
    b.  For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)` (up, down, left, right):
        i.  Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries.
        ii. Check if `(nr, nc)` has not already been marked as "reachable".
        iii. Check if the color of the pixel `(nr, nc)` in the *input* grid is *not* green (3).
        iv. If all conditions (i, ii, iii) are true, mark `(nr, nc)` as "reachable" and add it to the queue/stack.
7.  After the flood fill is complete, iterate through every pixel `(r, c)` in the grid (from row 0 to height-1, column 0 to width-1).
8.  If the pixel `(r, c)` has *not* been marked as "reachable", change its color in the *output* grid to azure (8).
9.  If the pixel `(r, c)` *was* marked as "reachable", its color in the output grid remains the same as in the input grid (it was already copied in step 1).
10. Return the modified output grid.

## General Assessment

The previous code execution failed unexpectedly, producing the input grid as the output for all examples, despite the logic appearing sound for identifying and filling enclosed regions. The core transformation involves identifying pixels enclosed by green walls (color 3) and changing their color to azure (8), while leaving the green walls themselves and any pixels reachable from the grid border unchanged.

The failure suggests either a subtle bug in the implementation (perhaps related to the BFS or the final filling loop conditions) or an issue with the execution environment/test harness used previously. The most likely logical error would be incorrectly marking enclosed cells as reachable, or incorrectly applying the condition for filling.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-verify the core logic:** The algorithm should use a flood fill (like BFS) starting from all non-green border pixels. Mark all reachable non-green pixels. Iterate through the grid; any pixel that was *not* marked as reachable *and* is *not* originally green (3) should be changed to azure (8).
2.  **Analyze Metrics:** Calculate precise metrics for each example to confirm the pattern of change (number of pixels changed, locations, original colors).
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language program to accurately reflect this verified logic, paying close attention to the condition that only *non-green* unreachable cells are filled.

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
task_type: region_fill_bounded
color_palette: [0, 1, 3, 8] # white, blue, green, azure
input_colors_involved: [0, 1, 3] # white, blue, green
output_colors_involved: [0, 1, 3, 8] # white, blue, green, azure
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels with color values.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0-9.
      - location: (row, column) coordinates.
      - reachability: Boolean indicating if reachable from border via non-green path.
  - type: boundary_wall
    definition: Set of pixels with color green (3). They act as barriers.
  - type: exterior_region
    definition: Set of connected non-green pixels reachable from the grid border without crossing a green (3) pixel.
  - type: interior_region
    definition: Set of connected non-green pixels not reachable from the grid border without crossing a green (3) pixel (i.e., enclosed).
properties:
  - green_pixels: Act as impassable barriers for connectivity analysis. Remain unchanged in the output.
  - non_green_pixels: Can be part of the exterior or interior regions.
  - border_pixels: Pixels on the outermost rows/columns of the grid.
actions:
  - copy_grid: Create a mutable copy of the input grid for the output.
  - identify_reachability: Perform a flood fill (e.g., BFS) starting from all non-green border pixels. Mark all visited pixels (which must be non-green) as 'reachable'.
  - fill_interior: Iterate through all pixels in the grid. If a pixel was *not* marked as 'reachable' AND its original color was *not* green (3), change its color to azure (8) in the output grid.
relationships:
  - connectivity: A non-green pixel `A` is connected to another non-green pixel `B` if a path exists between them consisting only of adjacent non-green pixels.
  - reachability_from_border: A pixel is reachable if it's non-green and connected to any non-green border pixel.
  - enclosure: Green (3) pixels form boundaries that may prevent non-green pixels from being reachable from the border.
transformation:
  - rule: Find all non-green pixels that are enclosed by green (3) walls (i.e., not reachable from the border via paths of non-green pixels). Change the color of these enclosed, originally non-green pixels to azure (8). All other pixels (green walls, reachable non-green pixels) retain their original color.
metrics_summary:
  - All examples involve changing originally white (0) or blue (1) pixels to azure (8).
  - Green (3) pixels are never changed.
  - The number of changed pixels varies (15, 15, 19).
  - Grid dimensions vary across examples.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create an output grid by making an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Define the 'wall' color as green (3) and the 'fill' color as azure (8).
3.  Create a boolean grid, `reachable`, of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized to all `False`. This will track pixels reachable from the border.
4.  Initialize a queue for a Breadth-First Search (BFS).
5.  Iterate through all pixels on the border (top row, bottom row, left column, right column) of the input grid.
6.  For each border pixel `(r, c)`:
    a.  If the color of the pixel `input_grid[r, c]` is *not* the wall color (green, 3), mark `reachable[r, c]` as `True` and add the coordinates `(r, c)` to the BFS queue.
7.  While the BFS queue is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue a coordinate `(r, c)`.
    b.  Examine its four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right): `(nr, nc)`.
    c.  For each neighbor `(nr, nc)`:
        i.   Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries.
        ii.  Check if the neighbor has *not* already been marked as reachable (`reachable[nr, nc]` is `False`).
        iii. Check if the neighbor's color in the *input* grid (`input_grid[nr, nc]`) is *not* the wall color (green, 3).
        iv.  If all conditions (i, ii, iii) are true, mark `reachable[nr, nc]` as `True` and enqueue `(nr, nc)`.
8.  After the BFS is complete, iterate through every pixel `(r, c)` in the grid (from row 0 to height-1, column 0 to width-1).
9.  For each pixel `(r, c)`:
    a.  Check if the pixel was *not* marked as reachable (`reachable[r, c]` is `False`).
    b.  Check if the pixel's original color in the *input* grid (`input_grid[r, c]`) is *not* the wall color (green, 3).
    c.  If *both* conditions (a and b) are true, change the color of the pixel in the *output* grid (`output_grid[r, c]`) to the fill color (azure, 8).
10. Return the modified output grid.
