objects:
  - type: region
    definition: Connected area of pixels.
  - type: boundary
    definition: Pixels with color green (3).
  - type: exterior_region
    definition: Region of non-green pixels connected to the grid border.
  - type: interior_region
    definition: Region of pixels (any color) not connected to the grid border without crossing a green (3) pixel.
properties:
  - green_pixels: act as barriers or walls.
  - non_green_pixels: define pathways for connectivity from the border.
actions:
  - identify_connectivity: Determine which pixels are reachable from the grid border by moving only through non-green pixels.
  - fill_color: Change the color of unreachable pixels to azure (8).
relationships:
  - connectivity: A non-green pixel is connected to the border if a path of non-green pixels exists between them.
  - enclosure: Green pixels enclose regions, preventing non-green connectivity to the border.
transformation:
  - rule: Pixels not reachable from the border via paths of non-green pixels are changed to azure (8). All other pixels retain their original color.
