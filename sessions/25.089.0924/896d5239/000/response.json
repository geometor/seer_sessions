White and blue appear in the input and can be changed. Green (3) acts as a boundary or wall. Azure (8) is the new color introduced in the output.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying regions within the grid and changing the color of pixels within those regions to azure (8).\n4.  **Boundary Condition:** The green (3) pixels define the boundaries of the regions to be filled. Specifically, they act as impenetrable walls for a connectivity analysis starting from the grid's border.\n5.  **Filling Logic:** Regions (composed of any color, including green) that are not reachable from the grid's border without crossing a green (3) pixel are filled entirely with azure (8). Pixels reachable from the border without crossing a green (3) pixel retain their original color.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"

Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the color green (3). These pixels act as walls.\n3.  Initialize a set or grid to keep track of \"reachable\" pixels, initially empty.\n4.  Initialize a queue or stack for a flood fill or Breadth-First Search (BFS) / Depth-First Search (DFS).\n5.  Add all non-green pixels located on the border (top, bottom, left, right edges) of the input grid to the queue/stack and mark them as \"reachable\".\n6.  While the queue/stack is not empty:\n    a.  Dequeue/pop a pixel `(r, c)`.\n    b.  For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)` (up, down, left, right):\n        i.  Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries.\n        ii. Check if `(nr, nc)` has not already been marked as \"reachable\".\n        iii. Check if the color of the pixel `(nr, nc)` in the *input* grid is *not* green (3).\n        iv. If all conditions (i, ii, iii) are true, mark `(nr, nc)` as \"reachable\" and add it to the queue/stack.\n7.  After the flood fill is complete, iterate through every pixel `(r, c)` in the grid (from row 0 to height-1, column 0 to width-1).\n8.  If the pixel `(r, c)` has *not* been marked as \"reachable\", change its color in the *output* grid to azure (8).\n9.  If the pixel `(r, c)` *was* marked as \"reachable\", its color in the output grid remains the same as in the input grid (it was already copied in step 1).\n10. Return the modified output grid."
