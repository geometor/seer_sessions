task_type: bounded_fill
color_palette: [0, 1, 3, 8] # white, blue, green, azure

output_colors_involved: [0, 1, 3, 8] # white, blue, green, azure
objects:
  - type: region
    definition: Connected area of pixels.
  - type: boundary_pixel
    definition: A pixel with color green (3). Acts as an impenetrable wall for connectivity checks.
  - type: border_pixel
    definition: A pixel located on the outer edge (first/last row or column) of the grid.
  - type: exterior_region
    definition: The set of all non-green pixels reachable from any non-green border_pixel via a path consisting only of non-green pixels.
  - type: interior_region_candidates
    definition: The set of all pixels not belonging to the exterior_region.
properties:
  - boundary_pixels (green): are immutable; their color never changes. They block connectivity.
  - non_boundary_pixels: Can potentially change color.
  - reachability: A non-green pixel is reachable if it's on the border or connected to a reachable non-green pixel.
actions:
  - identify_reachability: Use flood fill (BFS/DFS) starting from non-green border pixels, propagating only through non-green pixels.
  - fill_color: Change the color of pixels that are identified as interior_region_candidates *and* were not originally green (3) to azure (8).
relationships:
  - connectivity: Pathfinding between non-green pixels.
  - enclosure: Boundary pixels (green) define areas potentially disconnected from the border.
transformation:
  - rule: Identify all non-green pixels reachable from the grid border without crossing green pixels. All other pixels *that were not originally green* are changed to azure (8). Originally green pixels remain green. Pixels identified as reachable retain their original color.
