## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 2D grids of pixels with integer values representing colors.
2.  **Colors:** The key colors involved are white (0), blue (1), green (3), and azure (8). White and blue appear in the input and can be changed. Green (3) acts as a boundary or wall. Azure (8) is the new color introduced in the output.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying regions within the grid and changing the color of pixels within those regions to azure (8).
4.  **Boundary Condition:** The green (3) pixels define the boundaries of the regions to be filled. Specifically, they act as impenetrable walls for a connectivity analysis starting from the grid's border.
5.  **Filling Logic:** Regions (composed of any color, including green) that are not reachable from the grid's border without crossing a green (3) pixel are filled entirely with azure (8). Pixels reachable from the border without crossing a green (3) pixel retain their original color.

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
task_type: fill_region
color_palette: [0, 1, 3, 8] # white, blue, green, azure
input_colors_involved: [0, 1, 3] # white, blue, green
output_colors_involved: [0, 1, 3, 8] # white, blue, green, azure
objects:
  - type: region
    definition: Connected area of pixels.
  - type: boundary
    definition: Pixels with color green (3).
  - type: exterior_region
    definition: Region of non-green pixels connected to the grid border.
  - type: interior_region
    definition: Region of pixels (any color) not connected to the grid border without crossing a green (3) pixel.
properties:
  - green_pixels: act as barriers or walls.
  - non_green_pixels: define pathways for connectivity from the border.
actions:
  - identify_connectivity: Determine which pixels are reachable from the grid border by moving only through non-green pixels.
  - fill_color: Change the color of unreachable pixels to azure (8).
relationships:
  - connectivity: A non-green pixel is connected to the border if a path of non-green pixels exists between them.
  - enclosure: Green pixels enclose regions, preventing non-green connectivity to the border.
transformation:
  - rule: Pixels not reachable from the border via paths of non-green pixels are changed to azure (8). All other pixels retain their original color.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid, which will become the output grid.
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the color green (3). These pixels act as walls.
3.  Initialize a set or grid to keep track of "reachable" pixels, initially empty.
4.  Initialize a queue or stack for a flood fill or Breadth-First Search (BFS) / Depth-First Search (DFS).
5.  Add all non-green pixels located on the border (top, bottom, left, right edges) of the input grid to the queue/stack and mark them as "reachable".
6.  While the queue/stack is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue/pop a pixel `(r, c)`.
    b.  For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)` (up, down, left, right):
        i.  Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries.
        ii. Check if `(nr, nc)` has not already been marked as "reachable".
        iii. Check if the color of the pixel `(nr, nc)` in the *input* grid is *not* green (3).
        iv. If all conditions (i, ii, iii) are true, mark `(nr, nc)` as "reachable" and add it to the queue/stack.
7.  After the flood fill is complete, iterate through every pixel `(r, c)` in the grid (from row 0 to height-1, column 0 to width-1).
8.  If the pixel `(r, c)` has *not* been marked as "reachable", change its color in the *output* grid to azure (8).
9.  If the pixel `(r, c)` *was* marked as "reachable", its color in the output grid remains the same as in the input grid (it was already copied in step 1).
10. Return the modified output grid.
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

"""
Identifies regions enclosed by green (3) pixels and fills them with azure (8).

The transformation logic involves a flood fill starting from the non-green pixels 
on the border of the grid. Any pixel that cannot be reached from the border 
without crossing a green (3) pixel is considered enclosed. All pixels within 
these enclosed regions are changed to azure (8). Pixels reachable from the border 
retain their original color. Green (3) pixels themselves are never changed.
