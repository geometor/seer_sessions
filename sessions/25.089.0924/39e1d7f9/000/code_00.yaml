task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integer color values (0-9).
  background_color: White (0).
  primary_structure: A larger grid formed by intersecting horizontal and vertical lines of a single color (grid_color).
  grid_color: Varies per example (Green=3, Azure=8). Determined by the color forming full-width/height lines.
  cells: The grid_color lines divide the main grid into smaller, equal-sized rectangular areas (cells).

objects:
  - object_type: grid_lines
    color: grid_color (task-dependent)
    shape: Horizontal and vertical lines spanning the grid.
    role: Defines cell boundaries.
    persistence: Unchanged between input and output.
  - object_type: content_block
    color: Any color except background (0) and grid_color. Varies per example (e.g., Yellow=4, Magenta=6, Green=3, Red=2).
    shape: Solid rectangles of uniform size within a task (e.g., 3x3 or 4x4).
    location: Contained within grid cells.
    persistence: Unchanged between input and output.
  - object_type: background_block
    color: White (0).
    shape: Solid rectangles, same size as content_blocks for the task.
    location: Contained within grid cells.
    persistence: Can be replaced in the output.

properties:
  - property_name: max_content_color
    description: The highest numerical color value among all content_blocks present in the entire input grid.
    scope: Global across the input grid.
  - property_name: cell_contains_content
    description: A boolean property for each grid cell, indicating if it contains at least one content_block.
    scope: Local to each grid cell.
  - property_name: block_dimensions
    description: The height and width of content_blocks and background_blocks (consistent within a task). Derived from spacing between grid_lines.
    scope: Global across the task.

actions:
  - action_name: identify_grid_structure
    description: Find the grid_color and the boundaries of the cells. Determine block_dimensions.
  - action_name: find_max_content_color
    description: Scan all content_blocks in the input grid to find the maximum color value.
  - action_name: check_cells_for_content
    description: For each cell, determine if it contains any content_blocks.
  - action_name: replace_background_blocks
    description: If a cell contains content, replace all background_blocks within that cell with blocks of the max_content_color.

relationships:
  - relationship_type: containment
    description: content_blocks and background_blocks are contained within specific grid cells.
  - relationship_type: transformation_trigger
    description: The presence of any content_block within a cell triggers the potential replacement of background_blocks in that same cell.
  - relationship_type: replacement_rule
    description: The color used for replacement (max_content_color) is determined globally from all content_blocks, not just those within the specific cell being modified.
