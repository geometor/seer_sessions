            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The most prominent feature in all examples is a background grid pattern. This grid is formed by horizontal and vertical lines of a single, consistent color (green=3 in `train_1`, azure=8 in `train_2` and `train_3`) that span the entire width and height of the input grid. White (0) is the background color.\n2.  **Grid Cells:** These grid lines divide the main grid into smaller, equally sized rectangular cells.\n3.  **Content Blocks:** Within these cells, there are distinct rectangular blocks of solid colors other than the background (white=0) or grid line color. Examples include yellow (4) and magenta (6) blocks in `train_1`, green (3) and magenta (6) in `train_2`, and red (2) and yellow (4) in `train_3`.\n4.  **White Blocks:** There are also rectangular blocks composed entirely of the white (0) background color, having the same dimensions as the content blocks within the same task.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves conditionally replacing some of the white blocks with a specific color block. The grid lines and the original content blocks remain unchanged. The condition for replacement depends on the presence of *any* content block within a grid cell, and the replacement color is determined by the content block with the highest numerical color value present *anywhere* in the entire input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"

These are the \"content blocks\".\n    *   Find the maximum numerical color value among all identified content blocks across the entire grid. Store this as `max_color`. If no content blocks exist, the grid remains unchanged.\n3.  **Process Each Cell:**\n    *   Iterate through each cell defined by the grid lines.\n    *   For the current cell, check if it contains *any* content blocks (blocks that are not background and not grid color).\n4.  **Apply Transformation (Conditional):**\n    *   **If** the current cell contains at least one content block:\n        *   Locate all rectangular blocks of size `block_h` x `block_w` within this cell that consist *only* of the background color (0).\n        *   Replace each of these background blocks with a block of the same size (`block_h` x `block_w`) filled entirely with the `max_color` determined in step 2.\n    *   **Else (if** the cell contains *no* content blocks):\n        *   Leave the cell unchanged.\n5.  **Construct Output:** The output grid consists of the original grid lines, the original content blocks, and the potentially modified background blocks."
