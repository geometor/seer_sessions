Transformation Rule:

1.  **Identify Grid Structure:** Determine the background color (assumed to be 0), the grid line color (the color forming full horizontal and vertical lines), and the dimensions of the cells defined by these lines. Calculate the dimensions (height `bh`, width `bw`) of the blocks contained within these cells (cell dimensions minus 1).
2.  **Find Maximum Content Color:** Scan the entire input grid for all solid rectangular blocks of size `bh` x `bw` that are neither the background color (0) nor the grid line color. Find the maximum numerical color value among these "content blocks". Store this as `max_color`. If no content blocks are found, the grid remains unchanged.
3.  **Process Cells:** Iterate through each cell defined by the grid lines.
4.  **Conditional Replacement:** For each cell:
    a. Check if the cell contains *any* content blocks (solid blocks of size bh x bw, not background or grid color).
    b. If it does, find all background blocks (solid blocks of color 0 with dimensions `bh` x `bw`) within that same cell.
    c. Replace each found background block with a solid block of `max_color` of the same dimensions (`bh` x `bw`).
    d. If the cell does not contain any content blocks, leave it unchanged.
5.  **Output:** The final grid includes the original grid lines, original content blocks, and the newly colored blocks where background blocks were replaced.
