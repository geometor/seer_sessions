The transformed outputs show the grid structure and original content blocks are preserved, but the replacement of background blocks within content-containing cells using the global maximum content color is not happening as expected.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Verify Intermediate Steps:** Use code execution to check the outputs of the helper functions (`find_grid_params`, `find_max_content_color`) for each training example to ensure the grid structure, block dimensions, and maximum content color are identified correctly.\n2.  **Debug Cell Content Check:** Explicitly check which cells are identified as containing content blocks for each example.\n3.  **Debug Replacement Logic:** Re-examine the loop that iterates through cells and performs the replacement, ensuring background blocks (solid blocks of color 0) are correctly identified and replaced with the `max_color` only when `cell_has_content` is true for that cell.\n4.  **Refine Descriptions:** Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect any corrections identified during debugging.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"

Specifically, the step where it iterates through a content-containing cell to find and replace background blocks must be flawed. It might be failing to identify the background blocks correctly, or failing to write the `max_color` into the `output_grid`.\n\nThe YAML and Natural Language Program from the previous step accurately describe the *intended* transformation based on visual inspection and the now-verified metrics. The fault was purely in the coding phase implementation of the final replacement step. Therefore, the YAML and Natural Language Program remain largely the same, reflecting the correct understanding of the task.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet (Revised/Confirmed)**\n\n"
