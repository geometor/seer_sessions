Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The most prominent feature in all examples is a background grid pattern. This grid is formed by horizontal and vertical lines of a single, consistent color (green=3 in `train_1`, azure=8 in `train_2` and `train_3`) that span the entire width and height of the input grid. White (0) is the background color.
2.  **Grid Cells:** These grid lines divide the main grid into smaller, equally sized rectangular cells.
3.  **Content Blocks:** Within these cells, there are distinct rectangular blocks of solid colors other than the background (white=0) or grid line color. Examples include yellow (4) and magenta (6) blocks in `train_1`, green (3) and magenta (6) in `train_2`, and red (2) and yellow (4) in `train_3`.
4.  **White Blocks:** There are also rectangular blocks composed entirely of the white (0) background color, having the same dimensions as the content blocks within the same task.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves conditionally replacing some of the white blocks with a specific color block. The grid lines and the original content blocks remain unchanged. The condition for replacement depends on the presence of *any* content block within a grid cell, and the replacement color is determined by the content block with the highest numerical color value present *anywhere* in the entire input grid.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**

task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integer color values (0-9).
  background_color: White (0).
  primary_structure: A larger grid formed by intersecting horizontal and vertical lines of a single color (grid_color).
  grid_color: Varies per example (Green=3, Azure=8). Determined by the color forming full-width/height lines.
  cells: The grid_color lines divide the main grid into smaller, equal-sized rectangular areas (cells).

    role: Defines cell boundaries.
    persistence: Unchanged between input and output.
  - object_type: content_block
    color: Any color except background (0) and grid_color. Varies per example (e.g., Yellow=4, Magenta=6, Green=3, Red=2).
    shape: Solid rectangles of uniform size within a task (e.g., 3x3 or 4x4).
    location: Contained within grid cells.

    description: For each cell, determine if it contains any content_blocks.
  - action_name: replace_background_blocks
    description: If a cell contains content, replace all background_blocks within that cell with blocks of the max_content_color.

relationships:

  - relationship_type: transformation_trigger
    description: The presence of any content_block within a cell triggers the potential replacement of background_blocks in that same cell.
  - relationship_type: replacement_rule
    description: The color used for replacement (max_content_color) is determined globally from all content_blocks, not just those within the specific cell being modified.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Grid Parameters:**
    *   Determine the background color (which is consistently white=0).
    *   Identify the single color used for the grid lines (the `grid_color`) by finding the color that forms complete horizontal and vertical lines dividing the grid.
    *   Calculate the spacing between grid lines to determine the dimensions of the cells and the size (`block_h`, `block_w`) of the smaller blocks within them (block dimension is grid spacing - 1).
2.  **Find Maximum Content Color:**
    *   Scan the entire input grid.
    *   Identify all rectangular blocks of size `block_h` x `block_w` that are *not* the background color (0) and *not* the `grid_color`. These are the "content blocks".
    *   Find the maximum numerical color value among all identified content blocks across the entire grid. Store this as `max_color`. If no content blocks exist, the grid remains unchanged.
3.  **Process Each Cell:**
    *   Iterate through each cell defined by the grid lines.
    *   For the current cell, check if it contains *any* content blocks (blocks that are not background and not grid color).
4.  **Apply Transformation (Conditional):**
    *   **If** the current cell contains at least one content block:
        *   Locate all rectangular blocks of size `block_h` x `block_w` within this cell that consist *only* of the background color (0).
        *   Replace each of these background blocks with a block of the same size (`block_h` x `block_w`) filled entirely with the `max_color` determined in step 2.
    *   **Else (if** the cell contains *no* content blocks):
        *   Leave the cell unchanged.
5.  **Construct Output:** The output grid consists of the original grid lines, the original content blocks, and the potentially modified background blocks.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transformation Rule:

1.  **Identify Grid Structure:** Determine the background color (0), the grid line color (the color forming full horizontal and vertical lines), and the dimensions of the cells defined by these lines. Calculate the dimensions (height `bh`, width `bw`) of the blocks contained within these cells (cell dimensions minus 1).
2.  **Find Maximum Content Color:** Scan the entire input grid for all solid rectangular blocks of size `bh` x `bw` that are neither the background color (0) nor the grid line color. Find the maximum numerical color value among these "content blocks". Store this as `max_color`. If no content blocks are found, the grid remains unchanged.
3.  **Process Cells:** Iterate through each cell defined by the grid lines.
4.  **Conditional Replacement:** For each cell:
    a. Check if the cell contains *any* content blocks.
    b. If it does, find all background blocks (solid blocks of color 0 with dimensions `bh` x `bw`) within that same cell.
    c. Replace each found background block with a solid block of `max_color` of the same dimensions (`bh` x `bw`).
    d. If the cell does not contain any content blocks, leave it unchanged.
5.  **Output:** The final grid includes the original grid lines, original content blocks, and the newly colored blocks where background blocks were replaced.

Find the maximum numerical color value among these "content blocks". Store this as `max_color`. If no content blocks are found, the grid remains unchanged.

    b. If it does, find all background blocks (solid blocks of color 0 with dimensions `bh` x `bw`) within that same cell.
