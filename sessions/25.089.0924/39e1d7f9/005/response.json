These are \"content blocks\".\n    *   Find the maximum numerical color value among all these content blocks across the entire grid. Store this as max_color.\n    *   If no content blocks are found anywhere, return the input grid unchanged.\n\n3.  **Process Cells and Apply Transformation:**\n    *   Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n    *   Iterate through each cell defined by the grid lines.\n    *   **For each cell:**\n        *   Check if the cell contains at least one solid content block (size block_h x block_w, color not 0 or grid_color).\n        *   **If the cell contains content:**\n            *   Iterate through all possible block positions (top-left corner r, c) within that specific cell.\n            *   If the block at input_grid[r:r+block_h, c:c+block_w] consists entirely of the background color (0):\n                *   Fill the corresponding area in the output_grid (output_grid[r:r+block_h, c:c+block_w]) with the globally determined max_color.\n        *   **If the cell does not contain content:** Leave the corresponding area in the output grid unchanged from the input.\n\n4.  **Return Output:** Return the modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_grid_params(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the grid line color, row/col indices, and block dimensions.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input numpy array.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple (grid_color, extended_rows, extended_cols, block_h, block_w)\n        or None if no valid grid structure is found.\n        extended_rows/cols include implicit borders -1 and h/w.\n    \"\"\"\n    h, w = grid.shape\n    grid_color = -1\n    \n    # Find potential grid colors by looking for uniform rows/cols (excluding background 0)\n    potential_grid_colors = {}\n    for r in range(h):\n        unique_colors, counts = np.unique(grid[r, :], return_counts=True)\n        # Check if the row is uniform and not background\n        if len(unique_colors) == 1 and unique_colors[0] != 0 and counts[0] == w:\n            color = unique_colors[0]\n            potential_grid_colors[color] = potential_grid_colors.get(color, {'rows': 0, 'cols': 0})\n            potential_grid_colors[color]['rows'] += 1\n            \n    for c in range(w):\n        unique_colors, counts = np.unique(grid[:, c], return_counts=True)\n         # Check if the col is uniform and not background\n        if len(unique_colors) == 1 and unique_colors[0] != 0 and counts[0] == h:\n            color = unique_colors[0]\n            potential_grid_colors[color] = potential_grid_colors.get(color, {'rows': 0, 'cols': 0})\n            potential_grid_colors[color]['cols'] += 1\n\n    # The grid color must form both rows and columns\n    valid_grid_colors = [color for color, counts in potential_grid_colors.items() if counts['rows'] > 0 and counts['cols'] > 0]\n\n    if not valid_grid_colors:\n        # Handle edge case: grid might have no lines (single cell)\n        # Or lines only in one direction (less common in ARC, treat as single cell for now)\n        # Need a fallback - perhaps check if only one non-zero color exists?\n        non_zero_colors = np.unique(grid[grid != 0])\n        if len(non_zero_colors) == 1:\n             # Assume this single color *might* be the grid color if it forms any lines\n             # But more likely, it's content in a gridless setup.\n             # Let's assume gridless means the whole thing is one block/cell\n             # We still need a grid_color for checks later, maybe pick -1 or a dummy?\n             # Let's return None to indicate no standard grid structure found.\n             return None\n        else:\n            # Cannot determine grid structure reliably\n             return None\n\n    # Usually there's only one valid grid color.
