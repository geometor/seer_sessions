*   **Perception:** The input grid contains several distinct objects (colored shapes) scattered, primarily in the upper and lower portions, against a white background. A prominent feature is a large, thick horizontal band of a single color (red in train_1, azure in train_2) located roughly in the middle or lower-middle section. This band contains several white pixels ("holes"). Above this band, there are other smaller colored shapes. The transformation involves these upper shapes "raining" or "projecting" their colors downwards. When a color projection hits a white hole within the main colored band, the hole adopts that color in the output. The original shapes above the band disappear in the output, turning white. If multiple colors are stacked vertically above a hole, the color of the lowest non-white pixel above the hole is the one that fills it. The main colored band itself remains otherwise unchanged.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - object: base_block
        description: A large, predominantly horizontal block of a single non-white color (e.g., red, azure), potentially containing holes.
        properties:
          - color: The single non-white color composing the block (e.g., 2 or 8).
          - vertical_range: Defined by the minimum (topmost) and maximum (bottommost) row indices containing the base_color. Let min_row be the top boundary.
          - holes: Pixels within the vertical_range of the base_block that have the color white (0) in the input grid.
      - object: source_shapes
        description: One or more distinct shapes composed of non-white pixels located entirely above the base_block (rows < min_row).
        properties:
          - color: The color of the pixels composing each shape.
          - position: Located at rows strictly less than min_row.
      - object: background
        description: Pixels with the color white (0) that are not holes within the base_block.

    actions:
      - action: identify_base_block

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the primary color (`base_color`) that forms the large horizontal band and find the uppermost row index (`min_row`) where this `base_color` appears.
    3.  Iterate through each column `c` of the grid.
    4.  Iterate through each row `r` from `min_row` down to the last row of the grid.
    5.  If the pixel at `input[r][c]` is white (0):
        a.  Initialize a `paint_color` variable to white (0).
        b.  Scan upwards from row `k = r - 1` to row `0` in the same column `c`.
        c.  If a non-white pixel `input[k][c]` is found, set `paint_color` to the color of `input[k][c]` and stop the upward scan for this hole.
        d.  Set the pixel at `output[r][c]` to the final `paint_color`.
    6.  After checking all relevant pixels (steps 3-5), iterate through all rows `r` from 0 up to (but not including) `min_row`.
    7.  For each column `c`, set the pixel `output[r][c]` to white (0).
    8.  Return the modified output grid.

Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the main horizontal band: Find the most frequent non-white color ('base_color') in the input grid. Determine the topmost row ('min_row') where this 'base_color' first appears. This row marks the upper boundary of the main band area.
2. Project colors downwards: For every white pixel (hole) located at or below 'min_row', look vertically upwards in the same column. Find the first non-white pixel encountered in the rows above 'min_row'. 
3. Fill holes: Fill the white hole in the output grid with the color found in step 2. If no non-white pixel is found above, the hole remains white.
4. Clear upper area: Set all pixels in the output grid in rows above 'min_row' to white (0).
5. Preserve the rest: Pixels at or below 'min_row' that are not white holes retain their original color from the input grid.
