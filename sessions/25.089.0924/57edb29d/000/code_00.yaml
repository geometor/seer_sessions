task_elements:
  - background_color: 4 # Yellow
  - objects:
      description: Contiguous regions of a single color, distinct from the background.
      properties:
        - color: The primary color of the object (e.g., Red, Blue, Green, Azure).
        - location: Position within the grid.
        - shape: General form.
        - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing the object.
        - contains_inner_pattern: Boolean, true if the object encloses pixels of the 'inner_pattern_color'.
  - inner_pattern_color:
      description: A single color (different from host object colors and background) found as pixels inside one or more host objects within a single input grid.
      examples:
        - train_1: 5 # Gray
        - train_2: 7 # Orange
        - train_3: 6 # Magenta
      identification: The unique color C that exists such that a pixel of color C is adjacent to a pixel of a host color H (where H is not background and H != C), and C appears within multiple different host colors.
  - selected_host_object:
      description: The specific object from the input whose inner pattern determines the output.
      selection_rule: Determined by a mapping based on the 'inner_pattern_color'.
      mapping:
        - if inner_pattern_color == 5 (Gray), selected_host_color = 3 (Green)
        - if inner_pattern_color == 7 (Orange), selected_host_color = 8 (Azure)
        - if inner_pattern_color == 6 (Magenta), selected_host_color = 1 (Blue)
      properties_used:
        - color: The color 'h_selected' corresponding to the mapping.
        - bounding_box: Used to define the output grid size and extract the pattern region.
        - content: Pixels within the bounding box, specifically those matching 'inner_pattern_color' and 'h_selected'.
  - output_grid:
      derivation: Extracted and recolored pattern from the 'selected_host_object'.
      size: Same dimensions as the bounding box of the 'selected_host_object'.
      content:
        - Pixels corresponding to the 'inner_pattern_color' in the host object's subgrid retain that color.
        - All other pixels (originally the host color 'h_selected') become 'h_selected'.
