            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code failed because it did not correctly implement the reflection logic. The `transform` function created a copy of the input but never modified it to include the reflected pattern. The code correctly identified the axis finding function (`find_reflection_axis`) and the core loop structure, but the critical step of writing the reflected pixel color to the output grid was missing or incorrect in the provided results (the transformed outputs shown were identical to the inputs, suggesting the write operation `output_np[r, c_right] = pixel_color` might have been absent or commented out in the execution that produced those specific outputs, even though it was present in the displayed code snippet).\n\nA closer look at the examples reveals a crucial detail missed in the initial observation: the reflection axis isn't always purely yellow (4). In all three training examples, the axis column contains azure (8) pixels where the azure boundary markers intersect the axis column. This means the `find_reflection_axis` function, which strictly requires *all* pixels in the column to be yellow (4), will fail for these examples.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the axis identification logic to find the central vertical line that acts as the symmetry axis, even if it contains colors other than yellow (4) where boundary markers (8) intersect it. A potential approach is to find the column that predominantly consists of yellow (4) or is positioned centrally. However, given the examples, the most robust method seems to be identifying the column containing *any* yellow (4) pixel, assuming there's only one such column acting as the axis.\n2.  Correct the reflection logic to ensure that *all* non-background (orange-7) pixels to the left of the axis are reflected, including the azure (8) boundary markers.\n3.  Verify the reflection calculation `c_right = col_axis + (col_axis - c_left)`.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
