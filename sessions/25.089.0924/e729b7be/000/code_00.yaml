task_description: Reflects a pattern found left of a central vertical yellow line horizontally across that line onto the right side.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of colored pixels.
  - element: vertical_line
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - orientation: vertical
      - role: axis_of_reflection
      - location: central column (variable column index depending on grid width)
  - element: source_pattern
    properties:
      - location: left of the vertical_line
      - composition: contiguous or non-contiguous shapes made of non-background colors.
      - role: object_to_be_reflected
  - element: background
    properties:
      - color: orange (7)
      - role: fills empty space
  - element: boundary_markers (optional)
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - location: edges of the grid, vertically aligned with pattern extent
      - role: potentially define vertical bounds for reflection

actions:
  - action: identify_axis
    description: Find the column index of the vertical yellow line.
  - action: identify_source
    description: Isolate the pattern pixels located to the left of the axis.
  - action: reflect_pattern
    description: Calculate the mirrored position for each source pattern pixel across the axis.
    details: For a pixel at (row, col_left) and axis at col_axis, the reflected position is (row, col_axis + (col_axis - col_left)).
  - action: draw_reflection
    description: Copy the color of each source pattern pixel to its calculated reflected position in the output grid.
  - action: preserve_original
    description: Keep the original left side, the axis, and background pixels outside the reflected pattern area unchanged in the output.

relationships:
  - relationship: reflection
    subject: source_pattern
    object: area_right_of_axis
    predicate: is reflected across the vertical_line onto
  - relationship: boundary
    subject: boundary_markers (if present) or pattern_extent
    predicate: define the vertical range of the reflection operation.
