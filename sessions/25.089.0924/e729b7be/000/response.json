            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided training examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Central Axis:** Each input grid features a prominent vertical line composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels. This line acts as a central feature or boundary.\n2.  **Pattern Region:** To the left of this yellow line, there is a distinct pattern made of various colors (non-orange). The background color is orange (7).\n3.  **Boundary Markers:** In examples 1 and 3, there are azure (8) pixels on the left and right edges of the grid, vertically aligned with the top and bottom extent of the pattern. These seem to indicate the vertical bounds of the operation area. Example 2 also has azure corners.\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grid retains the original left side of the input grid (including the pattern) and the central yellow line. The key transformation happens on the right side of the yellow line. The pattern originally on the left side is horizontally reflected across the yellow line and placed onto the right side.\n5.  **Overwriting:** The reflected pattern overwrites the original background pixels (orange-7) on the right side, but only within the vertical extent defined by the original pattern (and potentially marked by the azure corners). Pixels outside this vertical range on the right side remain orange (7).\n6.  **Symmetry:** The core operation is creating horizontal symmetry across the yellow vertical line, using the pattern on the left as the source.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
