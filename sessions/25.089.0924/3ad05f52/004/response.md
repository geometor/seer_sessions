*   **Assessment:** The previous code failed to modify the input grid at all, producing outputs identical to the inputs. This indicates a fundamental flaw in the flood fill implementation or its conditions. The core idea of identifying a boundary color (azure 8), a fill color (unique non-boundary, non-background color), and seed points (locations of the fill color) seems correct based on visual inspection of the examples. The transformation fills internal white (0) areas, bounded by azure (8), starting from the seed points. The previous attempt's "exterior white" logic was likely unnecessary or incorrectly implemented, preventing any fill from occurring. The strategy is to simplify the approach back to a standard 4-way flood fill algorithm, ensuring the conditions for filling (neighbor is white) and stopping (neighbor is azure boundary or already visited) are correctly applied.
