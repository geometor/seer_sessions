Perform a flood fill operation on the input grid.
1. Identify the unique 'fill color' which is not white (0) or azure (8).
2. Identify all pixels with this 'fill color' in the input grid; these are the 'seed points'.
3. Starting from the seed points, perform a 4-way flood fill on the grid.
4. The fill operation changes white (0) pixels to the 'fill color'.
5. The fill stops at the grid boundaries and at pixels with the azure (8) color (or any color other than white).
6. The output grid is the input grid after the flood fill operation.
