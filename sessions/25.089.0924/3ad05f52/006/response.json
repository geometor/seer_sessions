Scan the input grid to find the unique color that is not white (0) and not azure (8). This is the 'fill color'.\n3.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the 'fill color'. These are the 'seed points'. If no such color or seed points exist, return the initial output grid.\n4.  **Identify Exterior White Pixels:**\n    a.  Create a boolean grid `is_exterior` of the same dimensions, initialized to `False`.\n    b.  Create a queue `exterior_queue`.\n    c.  Iterate through all pixels on the border (top, bottom, left, right edges) of the input grid.\n    d.  If a border pixel is white (0) and not already marked in `is_exterior`:\n        i.  Mark it as `True` in `is_exterior`.\n        ii. Add its coordinates to `exterior_queue`.\n    e.  While `exterior_queue` is not empty:\n        i.  Dequeue a location `(r, c)`.\n        ii. For each of its 4-way adjacent neighbors `(nr, nc)`:\n            1. Check if `(nr, nc)` is within grid bounds.\n            2. Check if the neighbor pixel in the *input grid* is white (0).\n            3. Check if `(nr, nc)` is not already marked in `is_exterior`.\n            4. If all checks pass: Mark `(nr, nc)` as `True` in `is_exterior` and enqueue it.\n5.  **Perform Constrained Flood Fill:**\n    a.  Create a queue `fill_queue` and add all 'seed points' to it.\n    b.  Create a set `visited` and add all 'seed points' to it. Also, add all coordinates `(r, c)` where `is_exterior[r, c]` is `True` to the `visited` set (these exterior points should not be processed by the fill).\n    c.  While `fill_queue` is not empty:\n        i.  Dequeue a location `(r, c)`.\n        ii. For each of its 4-way adjacent neighbors `(nr, nc)`:\n            1. Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries.\n            2. Check if `(nr, nc)` has not been visited yet.\n            3. Check if the neighbor's color in the *output grid* is white (0).\n            4. *Crucially, check if `is_exterior[nr, nc]` is `False`*.\n            5. If all checks pass (within bounds, not visited, is white, is *not* exterior):\n                a. Change the neighbor's color in the output grid to the 'fill color'.\n                b. Mark `(nr, nc)` as visited by adding it to the `visited` set.\n                c. Enqueue `(nr, nc)`.\n            6. Else (if neighbor fails any check, e.g., it's a boundary, exterior, already visited, or out of bounds):\n                a. Mark `(nr, nc)` as visited (if within bounds) to avoid re-checking it from other paths.\n6.  Return the modified output grid.**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code performed a standard flood fill originating from the seed color pixels (the unique color that isn't white=0 or azure=8). However, the results show that this fill operation incorrectly colored *all* reachable white pixels, including those outside the regions explicitly enclosed by the azure (8) boundaries. The fill \"leaked\" out into the exterior white space connected to the grid edges.\n\nThe core issue is that the fill needs to be constrained to *interior* regions. An interior region is defined as an area of white pixels completely surrounded by non-white pixels (specifically, the azure=8 boundaries in this task) or the grid edge, *and* reachable from at least one seed pixel. White pixels connected to the grid edge without crossing a non-white pixel boundary should be considered *exterior* and remain untouched.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify Exterior:** Before performing the main fill, identify all white pixels connected to the grid's border using a preliminary flood fill (or BFS/DFS) starting from all border white pixels. Mark these as \"exterior\".\n2.  **Constrained Fill:** Perform the main flood fill starting from the original seed color pixels. During this fill, only color a white pixel if it has *not* been marked as \"exterior\". The fill should still be bounded by azure (8) pixels and the grid edges.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n"
