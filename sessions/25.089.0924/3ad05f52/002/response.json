            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism as a flood fill originating from a unique seed color and bounded by azure (8). However, the implementation failed because it allowed the fill to \"leak\" into the outer background (white, 0) when seed pixels were adjacent to white pixels not fully enclosed by the azure boundary. The provided transformed outputs show that *all* initially white (0) pixels connected to a seed pixel (without crossing an azure pixel) were filled, regardless of whether they were \"inside\" or \"outside\" the main azure structures.\n\nThe expected outputs clearly show that the fill should be restricted to only those white (0) areas that are effectively \"enclosed\" by the azure (8) boundaries *and* contain or are connected to the seed pixels. White pixels forming the general background, even if adjacent to a seed pixel or a filled pixel, should remain white if they are not within such an enclosure.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify Exterior White Pixels:** Perform a preliminary flood fill (or BFS/DFS) starting from all white (0) pixels located on the grid's border. Mark all reachable white (0) pixels that do *not* require crossing a non-white pixel. These constitute the \"exterior\" white space.\n2.  **Perform Seeded Flood Fill:** Execute the main flood fill starting from the identified seed pixels (the unique non-0, non-8 color).\n3.  **Apply Constraint:** During the main flood fill, only change the color of a white (0) pixel if it was *not* marked as \"exterior\" in the first step. The fill should still be bounded by azure (8) pixels and grid edges.\n\nThis ensures the fill is contained within regions conceptually defined by the azure boundaries and connected to the seed color.\n\n## Metrics\n\nNo specific code execution is needed for metrics at this stage, as the error is visually apparent across all examples: the flood fill incorrectly colors the outer white background connected to the seed areas. The key metric difference is the count of the `fill_color` in the actual vs. expected output, with the actual output having a much higher count due to filling the background.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Scan the `input_grid` to find the unique color that is not white (0) and not azure (8). This is the `fill_color`. If no such color exists, return the `input_grid`.\n3.  Identify all pixels in the `input_grid` that have the `fill_color`. These locations are the `seed_points`. If no seed points exist, return the `input_grid`.\n4.  Identify the \"exterior white\" area:\n    a. Create a boolean mask `is_exterior` of the same dimensions as the grid, initialized to `False`.\n    b. Create a queue `exterior_queue`.\n    c. Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` on the border of the grid (row 0, last row, column 0, last column).\n    d. If `input_grid[r, c]` is white (0) and `is_exterior[r, c]` is `False`:\n        i. Mark `is_exterior[r, c] = True`.\n        ii. Add `(r, c)` to `exterior_queue`.\n    e. While `exterior_queue` is not empty:\n        i. Dequeue a location `(r, c)`.\n        ii. For each of its 4-way adjacent neighbors `(nr, nc)`:\n            1. Check if the neighbor is within grid boundaries.\n            2. Check if `input_grid[nr, nc]` is white (0).\n            3. Check if `is_exterior[nr, nc]` is `False`.\n            4. If all checks pass:\n                a. Mark `is_exterior[nr, nc] = True`.\n                b. Add `(nr, nc)` to `exterior_queue`.\n5.  Perform the main flood fill:\n    a. Create a queue `fill_queue` and add all `seed_points` to it.\n    b. Create a set `visited` and add all `seed_points` to it.\n    c. While `fill_queue` is not empty:\n        i. Dequeue a location `(r, c)`.\n        ii. For each of its 4-way adjacent neighbors `(nr, nc)`:\n            1. Check if the neighbor is within grid boundaries.\n            2. Check if the neighbor location `(nr, nc)` has not been `visited`.\n            3. Check if `output_grid[nr, nc]` is white (0).\n            4. Check if `is_exterior[nr, nc]` is `False` (i.e., the neighbor is *not* part of the exterior white area).\n            5. If all checks pass:\n                a. Change `output_grid[nr, nc]` to the `fill_color`.\n                b. Add `(nr, nc)` to `visited`.\n                c. Add `(nr, nc)` to `fill_queue`.\n            6. Else (neighbor is out of bounds, already visited, not white, or is exterior white):\n                a. Add `(nr, nc)` to `visited` to avoid re-processing, but do not fill or enqueue it.\n6.  Return the modified `output_grid`."
