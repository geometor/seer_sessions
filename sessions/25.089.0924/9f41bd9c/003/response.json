Identify a composite object predominantly made of gray (5) pixels, located adjacent to either the left or right vertical edge of the input grid. This object has a fixed width of 5 columns, but its height can vary.\n2. Determine the object's bounding box (top row, bottom row, left column, right column) and extract its pattern.\n3. Determine the direction of movement: if the object is on the left edge, it moves right; if on the right edge, it moves left.\n4. Calculate the target bounding box for the object on the opposite edge. The vertical position remains unchanged.\n5. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n6. Clear the object's original location in the output grid by filling the original bounding box area with the background color (blue, 1).\n7. Transform the extracted object pattern: For each row within the object pattern, starting from the 4th row (relative index 3), cyclically shift the pixels in that row to the right by `row_index - 2` positions (where row_index is the 0-based index within the pattern).\n8. Draw the *transformed* object pattern onto the output grid at the calculated target bounding box location.\n9. Identify the row index immediately below the object's original bottom row (`trail_row = original_bottom_row + 1`).\n10. Determine the horizontal range for a 'trail' of maroon (9) pixels to be drawn in the `trail_row`:\n    - If moving left: The trail spans from the column immediately to the right of the object's *final* right edge (`final_c2 + 1`) up to the object's *original* right edge (`original_c2`).\n    - If moving right: The trail spans from the object's *original* left edge (`original_c1`) up to the object's *final* left edge (`final_c1`).\n11. Fill the calculated trail range in the `trail_row` of the output grid with the trail color (maroon, 9), overwriting the existing color (typically magenta, 6).\n12. Return the modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_object_bbox(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the bounding box of the gray object located at a vertical edge.\n    Assumes the object width is 5.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    gray_color = 5\n    object_width = 5\n\n    coords = np.argwhere(grid == gray_color)\n    if coords.size == 0:\n        return None # No gray pixels found\n\n    min_r, min_c = np.min(coords, axis=0)\n    max_r, max_c = np.max(coords, axis=0)\n\n    # Determine if object is on left or right edge based on gray pixel coords\n    if min_c == 0 and max_c < object_width: # Likely on left edge\n        c1 = 0\n        c2 = object_width - 1\n        # Find the actual vertical extent based on gray pixels within these columns\n        edge_coords = coords[coords[:, 1] <= c2]\n        r1 = np.min(edge_coords[:, 0])\n        r2 = np.max(edge_coords[:, 0])\n    elif max_c == width - 1 and min_c >= width - object_width : # Likely on right edge\n        c2 = width - 1\n        c1 = width - object_width\n        # Find the actual vertical extent based on gray pixels within these columns\n        edge_coords = coords[coords[:, 1] >= c1]\n        r1 = np.min(edge_coords[:, 0])\n        r2 = np.max(edge_coords[:, 0])\n    else:\n        # Object not clearly at an edge or doesn't fit width assumption\n        return None \n\n    # Check if calculated width matches expected width\n    if c2 - c1 + 1 != object_width:\n         # This could happen if gray pixels don't span the full 5 assumed width\n         # Might need refinement, but stick to assumption for now.\n         print(f\"Warning: Detected object width {c2 - c1 + 1} differs from expected {object_width}\")\n\n    return (r1, c1, r2, c2)\n\ndef transform_pattern(pattern):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the object pattern by cyclically shifting rows >= 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    transformed = pattern.copy()\n    height, width = pattern.shape\n    for r in range(height):\n        if r >= 3:\n            shift = r - 2\n            # Apply cyclic shift right using np.roll\n            transformed[r, :] = np.roll(pattern[r, :], shift)\n    return transformed\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the described transformation to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    \n    background_color = 1\n    trail_color = 9\n\n    # 1.
