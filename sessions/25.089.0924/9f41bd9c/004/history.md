Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids feature a large background area of blue (1). There's a distinct horizontal bar of magenta (6) pixels spanning the full width at the bottom or near the bottom.
2.  **Key Object:** The central element is a composite object made of gray (5) and blue (1) pixels. This object has a consistent internal pattern (a 5-wide structure, 7 rows high, with gray forming a frame or specific pattern).
3.  **Object Location:** In the input grids, this gray/blue object is located either at the far left or far right edge, vertically positioned above the magenta bar.
4.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves the gray/blue object moving horizontally across the grid.
    *   If the object starts on the right edge, it moves to the left edge.
    *   If the object starts on the left edge, it moves to the right edge.
5.  **Interaction/Side Effect:** As the object moves, it leaves a "trail" or causes a color change in the magenta bar below it. The original position of the object is filled with the background blue (1). The trail appears as a segment of maroon (9) pixels within the magenta bar (6).
6.  **Trail Characteristics:** The trail appears in the row immediately below the object's vertical span. The horizontal extent of the trail depends on the direction of movement and the object's original and final positions.
    *   When moving left (Example 1), the trail covers the columns from *just after* the object's final right edge up to the object's *original* right edge.
    *   When moving right (Example 2), the trail covers the columns from the object's *original* left edge up to *one column past* the object's *final* left edge.

**Facts:**

  - element: background
    color: blue (1)
    description: Main background color filling most of the grid.
  - element: movable_object
    colors: [gray (5), blue (1)]
    description: A composite object with a fixed internal pattern, 5 columns wide and 7 rows high.
    location: Starts at either the far left or far right edge horizontally, above the magenta_bar.
  - element: horizontal_bar
    color: magenta (6)
    description: A solid horizontal bar, typically spanning the grid width, located below the movable_object's vertical position.
  - element: trail
    color: maroon (9)
    description: Appears as a result of the object's movement, modifying a segment of the horizontal_bar.
    location: In the row immediately below the movable_object's path (object_bottom_row + 1).
    extent: Varies based on movement direction and object positions.

    description: Set the pixels within the original object's bounding box to the background color (blue, 1).
  - action: move_object
    inputs: [output_grid, object_pattern, final_bbox]
    outputs: [modified_output_grid]
    description: Draw the object's pattern at the calculated final bounding box.
  - action: create_trail
    inputs: [output_grid, direction, original_bbox, final_bbox, trail_row_index]
    outputs: [final_output_grid]
    description: Modify the color of pixels in the trail_row_index from magenta (6) to maroon (9) based on the trail column range.
      - If moving left: columns from (final_right_col + 1) to original_right_col.
      - If moving right: columns from original_left_col to (final_left_col + 1).

relationships:
  - The movable_object is initially positioned adjacent to a vertical grid boundary (left or right).
  - The horizontal_bar is located below the vertical span of the movable_object.
  - The trail is generated in the first row of the horizontal_bar.
  - The position and extent of the trail depend directly on the object's start/end columns and movement direction.
  - The object's original location is replaced by the background color after movement.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Locate the composite object defined by gray (5) and blue (1) pixels. Record its pixel pattern and determine its bounding box (original top row `r1`, bottom row `r2`, left column `c1`, right column `c2`) and its width (`w = c2 - c1 + 1`).
3.  Determine the row index immediately below the object: `trail_row = r2 + 1`.
4.  Check the object's starting horizontal position:
    *   If `c1 == 0`, the object must move right. The direction is 'right'. Calculate the final left column: `final_c1 = grid_width - w`.
    *   If `c2 == grid_width - 1`, the object must move left. The direction is 'left'. Calculate the final left column: `final_c1 = 0`.
5.  Calculate the final right column: `final_c2 = final_c1 + w - 1`.
6.  Clear the object's original position in the output grid: Iterate through rows `r` from `r1` to `r2` and columns `c` from `c1` to `c2`, setting `output_grid[r][c]` to blue (1).
7.  Draw the object in its final position: Iterate through the object's recorded pattern relative offsets `(dr, dc)` and draw the corresponding color at `output_grid[r1 + dr][final_c1 + dc]`.
8.  Determine the column range for the trail:
    *   If the direction is 'left': `trail_start_col =

Transformation Rule:

1. Identify a composite object predominantly made of gray (5) pixels, located adjacent to either the left or right vertical edge of the input grid. This object has a fixed width of 5 columns, but its height can vary.
2. Determine the object's bounding box (top row, bottom row, left column, right column) and extract its pattern.
3. Determine the direction of movement: if the object is on the left edge, it moves right; if on the right edge, it moves left.
4. Calculate the target bounding box for the object on the opposite edge. The vertical position remains unchanged.
5. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
6. Clear the object's original location in the output grid by filling the original bounding box area with the background color (blue, 1).
7. Transform the extracted object pattern: For each row within the object pattern, starting from the 4th row (relative index 3), cyclically shift the pixels in that row to the right by `row_index - 2` positions (where row_index is the 0-based index within the pattern).
8. Draw the *transformed* object pattern onto the output grid at the calculated target bounding box location.
9. Identify the row index immediately below the object's original bottom row (`trail_row = original_bottom_row + 1`).
10. Determine the horizontal range for a 'trail' of maroon (9) pixels to be drawn in the `trail_row`:
    - If moving left: The trail spans from the column immediately to the right of the object's *final* right edge (`final_c2 + 1`) up to the object's *original* right edge (`original_c2`).
    - If moving right: The trail spans from the object's *original* left edge (`original_c1`) up to the object's *final* left edge (`final_c1`).
11. Fill the calculated trail range in the `trail_row` of the output grid with the trail color (maroon, 9), overwriting the existing color (typically magenta, 6).
12. Return the modified output grid.
