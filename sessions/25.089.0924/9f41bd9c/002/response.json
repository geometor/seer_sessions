            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanic: an object moving horizontally and leaving a trail. However, the comparison between the transformed output and expected output reveals crucial inaccuracies in the initial assumptions:\n\n1.  **Object Transformation:** The object's internal pattern (specifically the gray pixels) changes during the movement. It's not simply copied.\n2.  **Object Height:** The object's height is not fixed at 7 rows; it varies between examples (7 in Ex1, 5 in Ex2). The width appears consistently 5 columns.\n3.  **Trail Location:** The trail row calculation (`r2_orig + 1`) seemed inconsistent initially but appears correct upon re-examination of Example 2's input and expected output. The initial code failed because it assumed a fixed object height of 7, leading to an incorrect `r2_orig` for Example 2.\n4.  **Trail Extent:** The trail extent calculation for the 'right' movement needed a slight adjustment (`c1_final + 1` instead of `c1_final`).\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Refine the object identification method to dynamically determine its height based on the extent of gray pixels, while confirming its width is 5 and it's located at a side edge.\n2.  Implement the specific pattern transformation rule observed: rows below the 3rd row (relative index >= 3) are cyclically shifted right by `relative_row_index - 2`.\n3.  Use the dynamically determined `r2_orig` to calculate the `trail_row = r2_orig + 1`.\n4.  Use the corrected trail extent rules based on movement direction.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
