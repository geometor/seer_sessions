task_elements:
  - element: background
    color: blue (1)
    description: Main background color filling most of the grid.
  - element: movable_object
    colors: [gray (5), blue (1)]
    description: A composite object with a fixed internal pattern, 5 columns wide and 7 rows high.
    location: Starts at either the far left or far right edge horizontally, above the magenta_bar.
  - element: horizontal_bar
    color: magenta (6)
    description: A solid horizontal bar, typically spanning the grid width, located below the movable_object's vertical position.
  - element: trail
    color: maroon (9)
    description: Appears as a result of the object's movement, modifying a segment of the horizontal_bar.
    location: In the row immediately below the movable_object's path (object_bottom_row + 1).
    extent: Varies based on movement direction and object positions.

actions:
  - action: identify_object_and_bar
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [object_pattern, object_bbox, bar_row_index]
    description: Locate the gray/blue object and the magenta bar below it. Record object details.
  - action: determine_movement
    inputs: [object_bbox, grid_width]
    outputs: [direction, final_bbox]
    description: Check if the object is at the left (col 0) or right (col grid_width-1) edge. Determine movement direction (right or left) and calculate the final bounding box at the opposite edge.
  - action: clear_original_location
    inputs: [output_grid, original_object_bbox]
    outputs: [modified_output_grid]
    description: Set the pixels within the original object's bounding box to the background color (blue, 1).
  - action: move_object
    inputs: [output_grid, object_pattern, final_bbox]
    outputs: [modified_output_grid]
    description: Draw the object's pattern at the calculated final bounding box.
  - action: create_trail
    inputs: [output_grid, direction, original_bbox, final_bbox, trail_row_index]
    outputs: [final_output_grid]
    description: Modify the color of pixels in the trail_row_index from magenta (6) to maroon (9) based on the trail column range.
      - If moving left: columns from (final_right_col + 1) to original_right_col.
      - If moving right: columns from original_left_col to (final_left_col + 1).

relationships:
  - The movable_object is initially positioned adjacent to a vertical grid boundary (left or right).
  - The horizontal_bar is located below the vertical span of the movable_object.
  - The trail is generated in the first row of the horizontal_bar.
  - The position and extent of the trail depend directly on the object's start/end columns and movement direction.
  - The object's original location is replaced by the background color after movement.
