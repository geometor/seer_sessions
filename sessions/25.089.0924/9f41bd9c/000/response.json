            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids feature a large background area of blue (1). There's a distinct horizontal bar of magenta (6) pixels spanning the full width at the bottom or near the bottom.\n2.  **Key Object:** The central element is a composite object made of gray (5) and blue (1) pixels. This object has a consistent internal pattern (a 5-wide structure, 7 rows high, with gray forming a frame or specific pattern).\n3.  **Object Location:** In the input grids, this gray/blue object is located either at the far left or far right edge, vertically positioned above the magenta bar.\n4.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves the gray/blue object moving horizontally across the grid.\n    *   If the object starts on the right edge, it moves to the left edge.\n    *   If the object starts on the left edge, it moves to the right edge.\n5.  **Interaction/Side Effect:** As the object moves, it leaves a \"trail\" or causes a color change in the magenta bar below it. The original position of the object is filled with the background blue (1). The trail appears as a segment of maroon (9) pixels within the magenta bar (6).\n6.  **Trail Characteristics:** The trail appears in the row immediately below the object's vertical span. The horizontal extent of the trail depends on the direction of movement and the object's original and final positions.\n    *   When moving left (Example 1), the trail covers the columns from *just after* the object's final right edge up to the object's *original* right edge.\n    *   When moving right (Example 2), the trail covers the columns from the object's *original* left edge up to *one column past* the object's *final* left edge.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Record its pixel pattern and determine its bounding box (original top row `r1`, bottom row `r2`, left column `c1`, right column `c2`) and its width (`w = c2 - c1 + 1`).\n3.  Determine the row index immediately below the object: `trail_row = r2 + 1`.\n4.  Check the object's starting horizontal position:\n    *   If `c1 == 0`, the object must move right. The direction is 'right'. Calculate the final left column: `final_c1 = grid_width - w`.\n    *   If `c2 == grid_width - 1`, the object must move left. The direction is 'left'. Calculate the final left column: `final_c1 = 0`.\n5.  Calculate the final right column: `final_c2 = final_c1 + w - 1`.\n6.  Clear the object's original position in the output grid: Iterate through rows `r` from `r1` to `r2` and columns `c` from `c1` to `c2`, setting `output_grid[r][c]` to blue (1).\n7.  Draw the object in its final position: Iterate through the object's recorded pattern relative offsets `(dr, dc)` and draw the corresponding color at `output_grid[r1 + dr][final_c1 + dc]`.\n8.
