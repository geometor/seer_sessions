task_elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    role: static backdrop
  - element: palette
    description: A sequence of non-white, non-gray pixels, usually in a single row near the top.
    properties:
      - colors: variable, defines the color sequence
      - position: usually near the top, fixed between input and output
    role: defines the coloring sequence
  - element: canvas
    description: One or more contiguous shapes made of gray (5) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: gray (5) in input
      - shape: variable, often diagonal or irregular
      - position: variable
    role: the area to be colored
  - element: colored_canvas
    description: The output version of the canvas(es) where gray pixels are replaced.
    properties:
      - color: derived from the palette sequence
      - shape: identical to the input canvas shape
      - position: identical to the input canvas position
    role: the result of the transformation

transformation:
  action: color_fill
  input_elements: [palette, canvas]
  output_elements: [colored_canvas]
  rule: Replace gray pixels in each canvas with colors from the palette.
  details:
    - Identify the palette colors by scanning the input grid for non-white, non-gray pixels (usually in a row near the top), reading left-to-right.
    - Identify all contiguous gray (5) objects (canvases).
    - For each canvas object:
        - Iterate through its gray pixels in reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
        - Assign colors to these pixels sequentially using the palette colors.
        - If the end of the palette sequence is reached, cycle back to the first palette color.
        - The palette sequence application restarts for each distinct canvas object.
    - Leave all other pixels (background and original palette) unchanged.
