            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid contains two distinct types of non-background (white/0) elements:\n    *   A sequence of colored pixels, usually located near the top of the grid. I'll call this the \"palette\". The palette colors are read from left to right.\n    *   One or more larger shapes composed entirely of gray (5) pixels. I'll call these \"canvases\". These shapes are often diagonal or somewhat amorphous.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the palette exactly as it was in the input. The gray pixels of the canvas(es) are replaced with colors from the palette. The background (white/0) remains unchanged.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves coloring the gray pixels of the canvas(es) using the colors from the palette.\n4.  **Coloring Pattern:** The colors from the palette are applied sequentially to the gray pixels. When the end of the palette sequence is reached, it wraps around and starts again from the beginning.\n5.  **Pixel Order:** The gray pixels within each canvas seem to be colored in a specific order. Observing the examples, the order appears to be standard reading order: top-to-bottom, then left-to-right within each row.\n6.  **Multiple Canvases:** Example 3 shows two distinct gray canvases. The coloring process applies independently to each contiguous gray shape. The palette sequence is applied to the pixels of the first shape (in reading order), and then the sequence restarts from the beginning for the pixels of the second shape (also in reading order).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the sequence of colors in the palette by finding all non-white (0) and non-gray (5) pixels in the input grid, typically located together in a row. Store these colors in the order they appear (e.g., left-to-right). Let the number of colors in the palette be `N`.\n3.  Find all distinct contiguous objects composed solely of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.\n4.  For each distinct gray object found:\n    a.  Create a list of the coordinates `(row, col)` of all gray pixels belonging to this object.\n    b.  Sort this list of coordinates first by row index (ascending), and then by column index (ascending) for pixels in the same row. This establishes the \"reading order\" for the pixels within the object.\n    c.  Initialize a counter `palette_index` to 0.\n    d.  Iterate through the sorted list of gray pixel coordinates. For each coordinate `(r, c)`:\n        i.  Get the color from the identified palette sequence at the current `palette_index`.\n        ii. Set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to this palette color.\n        iii. Increment `palette_index` by 1.\n        iv. If `palette_index` equals `N` (the length of the palette), reset `palette_index` to 0 (to cycle through the palette).\n5.  Return the modified output grid."
