*   **Perception:**
    The input grid contains two distinct primary elements against a white background:
    1.  A large, contiguous object composed of a single non-white color. The shape and color of this object vary between examples.
    2.  A small, isolated rectangular grid (3x3 or 4x4 in the examples) composed of various different non-white colors. This seems to be the 'key' or 'template' grid.
    The output grid has the exact same dimensions as the 'key' grid found in the input.
    The transformation seems to involve filtering the colors within the 'key' grid based on the color of the large object. Specifically, for a given color of the large object, a predefined set of colors within the 'key' grid are replaced with white (0), while others retain their original color. The large object's shape itself doesn't seem to directly influence the output structure, only its color determines the filtering rule.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - object: background
        color: white (0)
        property: occupies most of the grid space
      - object: large_shape
        property: largest contiguous non-background object
        attributes:
          color: C (varies per example: green(3), blue(1), azure(8))
          shape: varies (H-like, 3 rectangles, S-like)
          size: varies
          location: varies (upper-middle, distributed, upper-middle)
      - object: key_grid
        property: small isolated rectangular grid of multiple colors
        attributes:
          size: varies (3x3, 3x3, 4x4)
          location: varies (lower-left, lower-middle, lower-right)
          content: contains multiple distinct non-white colors (V)

    action:
      type: selective_color_replacement
      input: key_grid
      output: grid of the same size as key_grid
      rule: replace certain colors (V) in the key_grid with white (0)

    relationship:
      - type: determines_filter
        source: large_shape.color (C)
        target: action.rule
        details: The color C of the large_shape determines *which* specific set of colors V within the key_grid will be replaced by white (0).
        examples:
          - if C is green(3), replace {blue(1), azure(8), maroon(9)} with white(0).
          - if C is blue(1), replace {blue(1), red(2), yellow(4), maroon(9)} with white(0).
          - if C is azure(8), replace {blue(1), green(3), gray(5), orange(7)} with white(0).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the largest contiguous object in the input grid that is not the background color (white, 0). Determine the color of this object (let's call it `filter_color`).
    2.  Identify the small, isolated rectangular patch of cells containing multiple distinct non-background colors (this is the `key_grid`). Note its dimensions and the color of each cell within it.
    3.  Define a set of 'target colors' to be replaced, based on the `filter_color` identified in step 1:
        *   If `filter_color` is blue (1), the target colors are {blue (1), red (2), yellow (4), maroon (9)}.
        *   If `filter_color` is green (3), the target colors are {blue (1), azure (8), maroon (9)}.
        *   If `filter_color` is azure (8), the target colors are {blue (1), green (3), gray (5), orange (7)}.
        *   (Assume for any other `filter_color`, the set of target colors is empty, although more examples might reveal other sets).
    4.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the `key_grid`.
    5.  Iterate through each cell of the `key_grid`.
    6.  For each cell, check if its color is present in the set of 'target colors' determined in step 3.
    7.  If the cell's color is in the 'target colors' set, place white (0) in the corresponding cell of the output grid.

Transformation Rule:

1. Identify all distinct contiguous regions (objects) of non-background (non-zero) pixels in the input grid.
2. Find the object with the largest number of pixels. This is the `large_shape`. Record its color (`filter_color`).
3. Among the *other* objects, find the one whose bounding box contains more than one distinct non-background color. This is the `key_grid_object`.
4. Determine the rectangular bounding box (slice) that encloses the `key_grid_object`.
5. Extract the sub-grid from the input grid defined by this bounding box. This is the `key_grid`.
6. Define a set of 'target colors' to be replaced with white (0) based on the `filter_color`:
    - If `filter_color` is blue (1), target colors are {blue (1), red (2), yellow (4), maroon (9)}.
    - If `filter_color` is green (3), target colors are {blue (1), azure (8), maroon (9)}.
    - If `filter_color` is azure (8), target colors are {blue (1), green (3), gray (5), orange (7)}.
    - Otherwise, the target color set is empty.
7. Create the output grid by making a copy of the `key_grid`.
8. Iterate through each cell of the output grid. If the cell's color is in the 'target colors' set, change that cell's color to white (0).
9. Return the modified output grid as a list of lists.
