            "text": "*   **Assessment and Strategy:**\n    The initial code failed because the method for identifying the `key_grid` was incorrect. It wrongly assumed the `key_grid` comprised all non-background pixels *not* belonging to the largest object. The results show that the code often extracted parts of the large object or a much larger area than intended.\n\n    The correct strategy requires distinguishing between two types of non-background objects:\n    1.  The `large_shape`: The single largest contiguous object, defined by one color. Its color determines the filter.\n    2.  The `key_grid`: A smaller, distinctly separate object, typically rectangular, containing multiple different non-background colors. This object needs to be identified independently, not just as \"what's left over\".\n\n    The revised approach will involve:\n    1.  Identifying *all* contiguous non-background objects.\n    2.  Identifying the largest object by pixel count to determine the `filter_color`.\n    3.  Among the *other* objects, identifying the one that acts as the `key_grid`. Criteria for the `key_grid` likely include having multiple distinct non-background colors within its bounding box and being spatially separate from the largest object.\n    4.  Extracting the grid corresponding *only* to the bounding box of the identified `key_grid` object.\n    5.  Applying the color filtering based on `filter_color` to this extracted `key_grid`.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    Let's analyze the objects in each example to refine the identification criteria.\n\n    "
