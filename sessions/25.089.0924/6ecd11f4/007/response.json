Identify all distinct contiguous regions (objects) of non-background (non-zero) pixels in the input grid.\n2. Find the object with the largest number of pixels. This is the `large_shape`. Record its color (`filter_color`).\n3. Identify the rectangular region corresponding to the 'key grid'. This is done by finding a non-background object, distinct from the `large_shape` (if possible), whose bounding box contains multiple unique non-background colors. If multiple such objects exist, heuristics might be needed (e.g., matching typical output sizes like 3x3 or 4x4), but the examples suggest one is clearly identifiable. If no separate object works, the bounding box of the `large_shape` itself might be the key grid if it contains multiple unique non-background colors.\n4. Determine the rectangular bounding box (slice) that encloses the identified key grid region.\n5. Extract the sub-grid from the input grid defined by this bounding box. This is the `key_grid`.\n6. Define a set of 'target colors' to be replaced with white (0) based on the `filter_color`:\n    - If `filter_color` is blue (1), target colors are {blue (1), red (2), yellow (4), maroon (9)}.\n    - If `filter_color` is green (3), target colors are {blue (1), azure (8), maroon (9)}.\n    - If `filter_color` is azure (8), target colors are {blue (1), green (3), gray (5), orange (7)}.\n    - If no `filter_color` was identified (e.g., no large object separate from the key grid), the target color set is empty.\n7. Create the output grid by making a copy of the `key_grid`.\n8. Iterate through each cell of the output grid. If the cell's color is in the 'target colors' set, change that cell's color to white (0).\n9. Return the modified output grid as a list of lists.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects_data(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies all connected non-background objects in the grid and returns their properties.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains data for one object:\n              'label' (int): The unique label assigned by scipy.ndimage.label.\n              'size' (int): The number of pixels in the object.\n              'color' (int): The color of the object (taken from the first pixel).\n              'slice' (tuple): The slice representing the bounding box.\n              'bbox_shape' (tuple): The shape (height, width) of the bounding box.\n              'num_unique_bbox_non_bg_colors' (int): Count of unique non-background colors within the bounding box.\n    \"\"\"\n    background_color = 0\n    labeled_array, num_features = label(grid != background_color)\n    \n    if num_features == 0:\n        return []\n\n    object_slices = find_objects(labeled_array)\n    object_data = []\n\n    for i in range(1, num_features + 1):\n        mask = labeled_array == i\n        coords = np.argwhere(mask)\n        # Ensure coords is not empty before accessing elements\n        if coords.size == 0:\n            continue # Skip if somehow an empty object is labeled\n\n        size = coords.shape[0]\n        obj_slice = object_slices[i-1]\n        bounding_box_grid = grid[obj_slice]\n        \n        # Count unique non-background colors within the bounding box\n        bbox_unique_colors = np.unique(bounding_box_grid)\n        num_bbox_unique_non_bg = len(bbox_unique_colors[bbox_unique_colors != background_color])\n        \n        # Get the color of the object itself (from the first pixel)\n        color = grid[coords[0, 0], coords[0, 1]]\n\n        object_data.append({\n            \"label\": i,\n            \"size\": size,\n            \"color\": color,\n            \"slice\": obj_slice,\n            \"bbox_shape\": bounding_box_grid.shape,\n            \"num_unique_bbox_non_bg_colors\": num_bbox_unique_non_bg\n        })\n        \n    # Sort objects by size, largest first\n    object_data.sort(key=lambda x: x[\"size\"], reverse=True)\n    return object_data\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation logic: identifies a large single-color object and a multi-color key grid,\n    then filters the key grid based on the large object's color.\n    \"\"\"\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    background_color = 0\n\n    # 1.
