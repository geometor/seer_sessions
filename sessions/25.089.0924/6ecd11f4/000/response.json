A large, contiguous object composed of a single non-white color. The shape and color of this object vary between examples.\n    2.  A small, isolated rectangular grid (3x3 or 4x4 in the examples) composed of various different non-white colors. This seems to be the 'key' or 'template' grid.\n    The output grid has the exact same dimensions as the 'key' grid found in the input.\n    The transformation seems to involve filtering the colors within the 'key' grid based on the color of the large object. Specifically, for a given color of the large object, a predefined set of colors within the 'key' grid are replaced with white (0), while others retain their original color. The large object's shape itself doesn't seem to directly influence the output structure, only its color determines the filtering rule.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
