            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial code correctly identified the core concept: using the color of the largest object (`filter_color`) to selectively remove colors from a smaller 'key' grid. However, the implementation failed because the logic to locate and extract this `key_grid` was flawed. The `find_key_grid_location` function incorrectly identified the key grid's boundaries, often selecting large portions of the input grid instead of the small, isolated patch of diverse colors. The failures across all examples confirm this localization error is the primary issue. The filtering rules based on the `filter_color` appear consistent with the examples.\n\n*   **Strategy:**\n    1.  Refine the `find_key_grid_location` function. The correct approach should be to first identify *all* pixels that are non-background (not white/0) AND do *not* belong to the largest contiguous object identified earlier. Then, calculate the minimum bounding box that encloses *only* these specific pixels. This ensures we isolate the intended key grid.\n    2.  Verify the largest object identification and color extraction remain correct.\n    3.  Verify the color filtering rules remain consistent across all examples.\n    4.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the refined key grid identification method.\n\n*   **Metrics and Analysis:**\n    Using code execution to verify properties:\n    "

The color matches expectations (3, 1, 8).\n    *   The `find_key_grid_location_props` function, using the refined logic (bounding box of non-background pixels *not* in the largest object mask), *still* fails drastically. It produces slices and grids that are much larger than the expected key grids. This indicates the assumption that the key grid comprises *all* non-largest-object pixels is wrong.\n    *   Let's reconsider the key grid identification: It's a *separate*, *isolated*, *rectangular* block of pixels, distinct from the largest object. It's not just \"everything else\". Perhaps we need to find *all* non-background objects, identify the largest one, and then find the object corresponding to the key grid based on properties like having multiple colors or being rectangular and compact?\n\n*   **Revised Strategy:**\n    1.  Identify *all* contiguous non-background objects.\n    2.  Find the largest object by pixel count. Note its color (`filter_color`) and mask.\n    3.  Consider the remaining objects. The `key_grid` is likely one of these. It seems to be characterized by being a relatively small, dense rectangle containing multiple distinct colors. We need a heuristic to select the correct object/region among the remaining ones. A simple approach might be to find the bounding box of *all* remaining pixels (as tried before) and *hope* it corresponds cleanly to the key grid. Since that failed, we need something more robust.\n    4.  Alternative Key Grid Identification: Find the bounding box of *all* non-background pixels. Find the bounding box of the *largest object*. Find the bounding box of the *pixels belonging to the key grid* (how?). The key grid seems spatially separate. Maybe find all objects, remove the largest, and find the bounding box of the union of the remaining objects? Still seems prone to error if there are stray pixels.\n    5.  Let's stick to the previous approach but debug `find_key_grid_location_props`. Why did it fail? Ah, the code used `slice(np.int64(3), ...)` etc. which is clearly wrong - those should be `min_row`, `max_row`, etc. Let's fix that in the next coding step. Assuming the *logic* (bounding box of non-background, non-largest-object pixels) is correct, the implementation was flawed.\n\n*   **Updated YAML Facts:**\n\n"
