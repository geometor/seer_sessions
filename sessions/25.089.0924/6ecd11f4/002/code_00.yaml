elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    property: occupies most grid space
  - object: largest_shape
    property: largest contiguous non-background object by pixel count
    attributes:
      color: C (varies: green(3), blue(1), azure(8))
      shape: varies
      location: varies
      mask: M (boolean mask indicating pixels belonging to this object)
  - object: key_grid_pixels
    property: set of all non-background pixels that are NOT part of largest_shape (i.e., where grid != 0 and M is False)
  - object: key_grid
    property: the minimum bounding box enclosing all key_grid_pixels
    attributes:
      size: varies (3x3, 3x3, 4x4)
      location: varies (lower-left, lower-middle, lower-right)
      content: contains multiple distinct non-white colors (V)

action:
  type: selective_color_replacement
  input: key_grid
  output: grid of the same size as key_grid
  rule: replace certain colors within the key_grid with white (0)

relationship:
  - type: determines_filter
    source: largest_shape.color (C)
    target: action.rule
    details: The color C determines which specific set of colors V within the key_grid will be replaced by white (0).
    rules:
      - if C is green(3), replace {blue(1), azure(8), maroon(9)} with white(0).
      - if C is blue(1), replace {blue(1), red(2), yellow(4), maroon(9)} with white(0).
      - if C is azure(8), replace {blue(1), green(3), gray(5), orange(7)} with white(0).
      - otherwise, replace {} (empty set)
