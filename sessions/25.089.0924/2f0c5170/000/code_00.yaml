Description: The task involves identifying distinct patterns enclosed within white borders in a larger grid and selecting one specific pattern based on its color diversity to form the output.

Input Grid:
  - type: grid
  - background_color: azure (8)
  - contains:
    - object: Frame
      - border_color: white (0)
      - shape: rectangle
      - encloses:
        - object: Pattern
          - composed_of: various colors (excluding azure and white)
          - background_within_frame: white (0)
    - properties: May contain multiple 'Frame' objects.

Output Grid:
  - type: grid
  - background_color: white (0)
  - content: A single 'Pattern' object extracted from the input grid.
  - size: Determined by the dimensions of the selected 'Pattern' content (excluding the white frame).

Transformation:
  - action: identify_frames
    - description: Locate all rectangular areas fully bordered by white (0) pixels.
  - action: extract_patterns
    - description: For each frame, extract the content (pixels inside the white border).
  - action: analyze_patterns
    - description: For each extracted pattern, count the number of unique non-white colors.
  - action: select_pattern
    - criteria: Choose the pattern with the maximum count of unique non-white colors.
  - action: create_output
    - description: Place the selected pattern onto a white (0) background grid matching the pattern's dimensions.

Relationships:
  - The output grid's content is a sub-grid of the input grid, specifically the content of one of the identified frames.
  - The selection of which pattern to output depends on a comparative property (color diversity) among all identified patterns in the input.
