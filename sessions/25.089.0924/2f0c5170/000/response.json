These regions are characterized by having a border composed entirely of white (0) pixels.\n3.  **Internal Patterns:** Inside these white-bordered frames, there are smaller patterns composed of various colors (green, yellow, red, blue). The space within the frame, not occupied by the pattern pixels, is also white (0).\n4.  **Multiple Objects:** Some input grids contain more than one such framed pattern (e.g., train\\_1, train\\_2, train\\_3).\n5.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are smaller than the input grids. They consist of one of the patterns found within a white frame in the input, placed on a white (0) background.\n6.  **Selection Criteria:** The key transformation seems to involve selecting *one* specific pattern from the potentially multiple patterns present in the input. Comparing the patterns within the frames in each example reveals a selection logic:\n    *   In train\\_1, the top-left pattern has only green (1 unique color). The bottom-right pattern has green and yellow (2 unique colors). The output is the bottom-right pattern.\n    *   In train\\_2, the top-right pattern has only red (1 unique color). The bottom-left pattern has red and yellow (2 unique colors). The output is the bottom-left pattern.\n    *   In train\\_3, the top-left pattern has yellow and blue (2 unique colors). The bottom-right pattern has only blue (1 unique color). The output is the top-left pattern.\n    *   This suggests the selection criterion is based on choosing the pattern with the greatest number of *unique* non-white colors.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
