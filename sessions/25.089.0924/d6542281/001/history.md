Okay, the definition of "isolated" needs refinement based on the code output.
*   Example 1: Only the Yellow (4) at (10, 14) is isolated. The Azure pixels at (3, 12) and (4, 12) are adjacent to each other (diagonally), so they are not isolated by my code's logic. BUT the task output *does* copy the Azure/Green object. This means the definition of "isolated" or the trigger for copying is different.
*   Let's redefine "isolated": A single pixel of a non-background color that is *not* part of a larger contiguous object of non-background colors. Contiguous means sharing an edge (not diagonal).
*   Let's redefine "complex object": A group of 2 or more non-background pixels connected edge-to-edge.
*   Let's redefine "anchor point": A pixel within a complex object.
*   Let's redefine "destination point": An "isolated" pixel (single non-background pixel not connected edge-to-edge to any other non-background pixel).

Let's re-evaluate with these definitions:

**Example 1 (Background Red 2):**
*   Complex Objects:
    *   Obj1: Blue(1)/Yellow(4) at (2,3) to (4,5). Pixels: (2,3),(2,4),(3,3),(3,4),(4,5). Contains Yellow(4) at (3,4) and Blue(1) at (2,3),(2,4),(3,3),(4,5).
    *   Obj2: Green(3)/Azure(8) at (12,6) to (14,8). Pixels: (12,6),(12,8),(13,6),(13,7),(14,6),(14,7),(14,8). Contains Azure(8) at (12,8) & (13,7) and Green(3) at (12,6),(13,6),(14,6),(14,7),(14,8).
*   Isolated Pixels (not connected edge-to-edge to other non-background):
    *   Azure(8) at (3, 12). Neighbors (edge): (2,12)=2, (4,12)=8, (3,11)=2, (3,13)=2. No, connected to (4, 12).
    *   Azure(8) at (4, 12). Neighbors (edge): (3,12)=8, (5,12)=2, (4,11)=2, (4,13)=2. No, connected to (3, 12).
    *   Yellow(4) at (10, 14). Neighbors (edge): (9,14)=2, (11,14)=2, (10,13)=2, (10,15)=2. Yes, isolated.
*   This still doesn't explain the copy triggered by Azure.

Maybe the trigger isn't an *isolated* pixel but just *any* single pixel of a specific color that exists *outside* the complex objects?
Let's call these "trigger pixels".

**Example 1 (Background Red 2):**
*   Complex Objects: Obj1 (Blue/Yellow), Obj2 (Green/Azure).
*   Other non-background pixels ("trigger pixels"): Azure(8) at (3, 12), Azure(8) at (4, 12), Yellow(4) at (10, 14).
*   Rule Attempt 3:
    1. Identify complex objects (connected non-background pixels).
    2. Identify all non-background pixels *not* part of these complex objects ("trigger pixels").
    3. For each trigger pixel:
        a. Let its color be C and location be D = (r_d, c_d).
        b. Find the *first* complex object (e.g., ordered by top-left coord) that contains at least one pixel of color C. Let this be Obj_Source.
        c. Find the *first* pixel (e.g., ordered by row then col) within Obj_Source that has color C. Let its location be A = (r_a, c_a). This is the anchor.
        d. Calculate the offset: Offset = (r_d - r_a, c_d - c_a).
        e. Copy Obj_Source by applying the Offset to all its pixels. Place the copied pixels onto the output grid.
*   Applying Rule Attempt 3 to Example 1:
    *   Trigger 1: Azure(8) at (3, 12). Color C=8, D=(3, 12).
        *   First object containing Azure(8) is Obj2.
        *   First Azure(8) pixel in Obj2 is at A=(12, 8).
        *   Offset = (3-12, 12-8) = (-9, 4).
        *   Copy Obj2 with this offset. Top-left (12, 6) -> (12-9, 6+4) = (3, 10). Still doesn't match output (copy at (3, 11)).
    *   Trigger 2: Azure(8) at (4, 12). Color C=8, D=(4, 12).
        *   First object containing Azure(8) is Obj2.
        *   First Azure(8) pixel in Obj2 is at A=(12, 8).
        *   Offset = (4-12, 12-8) = (-8, 4).
        *   Copy Obj2 with this offset. Top-left (12, 6) -> (12-8, 6+4) = (4, 10). Doesn't match output.
    *   Trigger 3: Yellow(4) at (10, 14). Color C=4, D=(10, 14).
        *   First object containing Yellow(4) is Obj1.
        *   First Yellow(4) pixel in Obj1 is at A=(3, 4).
        *   Offset = (10-3, 14-4) = (7, 10).
        *   Copy Obj1 with this offset. Top-left (2, 3) -> (2+7, 3+10) = (9, 13). This matches the output copy of Obj1.

*   Why did the Azure copy work in the earlier analysis but not now? Let's re-check the anchor/destination mapping for Azure that worked: Anchor (13, 7) [2nd Azure pixel in Obj2] to Dest (4, 12) [2nd Azure trigger pixel]. Offset = (-9, 5). Top-left (12, 6) -> (3, 11). This combination worked.
    *   This suggests the selection of *which* anchor pixel and *which* destination pixel (of the same color) matters. How is the pair chosen?
    *   Maybe it pairs the Nth anchor pixel of color C with the Nth trigger pixel of color C?
        *   Ex 1:
            *   Yellow: 1st anchor (3, 4), 1st trigger (10, 14). Offset (7, 10). Top-left -> (9, 13). OK.
            *   Azure: 1st anchor (12, 8), 1st trigger (3, 12). Offset (-9, 4). Top-left -> (3, 10). NO.
            *   Azure: 2nd anchor (13, 7), 2nd trigger (4, 12). Offset (-9, 5). Top-left -> (3, 11). OK.
        *   This pairing seems to work for Example 1. It implies we need to find *all* anchor pixels of a given color within an object and *all* trigger pixels of that same color, sort both lists, and pair them up.

*   Applying Nth pairing to Example 2 (Background Blue 1):
    *   Complex Object: Obj1. Top-left (1,1).
    *   Trigger pixels: Yellow(4) at (9, 6), Azure(8) at (11, 8).
    *   Yellow: 1st anchor (2, 2), 1st trigger (9, 6). Offset (7, 4). Top-left (1, 1) -> (8, 5). OK.
    *   Azure: 1st anchor (4, 4), 1st trigger (11, 8). Offset (7, 4). Top-left (1, 1) -> (8, 5). OK.
    *   Both pairings result in the same copy location. The output shows only one copy. Does the rule overwrite previous copies, or only copy once per object, or once per destination location? Since both map to the same location, it works out.

*   Applying Nth pairing to Example 3 (Background Azure 8):
    *   Complex Object 1 (Obj1): Blue(1)/Red(2)/Green(3). Top-left: (1, 0).
        *   Anchors: Blue(1): (1,0), (2,3), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2). Red(2): (2,1), (3,2), (4,11). Green(3): (4,3).
    *   Complex Object 2 (Obj2): Red(2). Top-left: (3, 10).
        *   Anchors: Red(2): (3,10), (4,11).
    *   Complex Object 3 (Obj3): Red(2). Top-left: (8, 5).
        *   Anchors: Red(2): (8,5), (9,6).
    *   Trigger pixels (non-background, not part of complex objects edge-connected):
        *   Blue(1) at (1, 0)? No, connected to Red(2) at (2,1).
        *   Blue(1) at (2, 3)? No, connected to Red(2) at (2,1) and (3,3).
        *   Blue(1) at (3, 3)? No, connected to Red(2) at (3,2) and Blue(1) at (2,3)/(4,2).
        *   Blue(1) at (4, 1)? No, connected to Blue(1) at (4,2) and Red(2) at (3,2).
        *   Blue(1) at (4, 2)? No, connected to Blue(1) at (4,1), Green(3) at (4,3), Red(2) at (3,2).
        *   Red(2) at (2, 1)? No.
        *   Red(2) at (3, 2)? No.
        *   Green(3) at (4, 3)? No.
        *   Red(2) at (3, 10)? No, connected to Red(2) at (4,11).
        *   Red(2) at (4, 11)? No.
        *   Red(2) at (8, 5)? No, connected to Red(2) at (9,6).
        *   Red(2) at (9, 6)? No.
    *   Wait, the definition of complex object was "2 or more connected non-background". Let's redefine "complex object" as any contiguous group (edge-connected) of non-background pixels. "Trigger pixels" are non-background pixels NOT belonging to any complex object (i.e., size 1 components).

*   Re-evaluating "Trigger Pixels" / Size 1 Components:
    *   Example 1: Azure(8) at (3,12), Azure(8) at (4,12), Yellow(4) at (10,14). My tool said only Yellow was isolated (no diagonal check needed for this step, just edge check). Let's re-run mentally.
        *   (3,12) Azure: Neighbors (N,S,E,W) are (2,12)R, (4,12)A, (3,13)R, (3,11)R. Connected to (4,12)A. Part of an Azure object of size 2.
        *   (4,12) Azure: Neighbors are (3,12)A, (5,12)R, (4,13)R, (4,11)R. Connected to (3,12)A. Part of an Azure object of size 2.
        *   (10,14) Yellow: Neighbors are (9,14)R, (11,14)R, (10,15)R, (10,13)R. Not connected. Size 1 component. Trigger pixel.
        *   This *still* doesn't explain the Azure copy.

What if the "trigger pixels" are defined differently?
Maybe any pixel C whose color exists in *exactly one* complex object?
*   Example 1:
    *   Yellow(4) exists only in Obj1. Trigger pixel is Yellow(4) at (10, 14).
    *   Azure(8) exists only in Obj2. Trigger pixels are Azure(8) at (3, 12) and (4, 12).
    *   Blue(1) exists only in Obj1. No trigger pixels.
    *   Green(3) exists only in Obj2. No trigger pixels.
*   This seems promising! Let's call these "unique color markers".

*   Rule Attempt 4:
    1. Identify complex objects (connected non-background pixels, size >= 2).
    2. Identify single non-background pixels (size 1 components). Call these "markers".
    3. Create a mapping: For each color C present in the grid (excluding background):
        *   Count how many complex objects contain C.
        *   If count is 1, find the unique complex object Obj_C containing C.
        *   Find all marker pixels with color C.
        *   Find all pixels within Obj_C with color C (these are the anchors).
        *   Sort the list of anchors (row then col).
        *   Sort the list of markers (row then col).
        *   For i from 0 to min(len(anchors), len(markers)) - 1:
            *   Pair anchor[i] with marker[i].
            *   Calculate offset = marker[i].pos - anchor[i].pos.
            *   Schedule a copy of Obj_C using this offset.
    4. Create the output grid by starting with the input grid.
    5. Apply all scheduled copies, potentially overwriting previous pixels including the original objects or other copies. The order might matter if copies overlap. Let's assume later copies overwrite earlier ones (e.g., process colors in numerical order, or process markers in sorted order). Let's try processing markers in sorted order.

*   Applying Rule Attempt 4 to Example 1:
    *   Complex Objects: Obj1 (Blue/Yellow), Obj2 (Green/Azure).
    *   Markers: Azure(8) at (3, 12), Azure(8) at (4, 12), Yellow(4) at (10, 14).
    *   Color Analysis:
        *   Blue(1): Only in Obj1. No markers. No copy.
        *   Yellow(4): Only in Obj1. Markers: (10, 14). Anchors in Obj1: (3, 4).
            *   Pair 1: Anchor (3, 4), Marker (10, 14). Offset = (7, 10). Copy Obj1 offset by (7, 10).
        *   Green(3): Only in Obj2. No markers. No copy.
        *   Azure(8): Only in Obj2. Markers: (3, 12), (4, 12). Anchors in Obj2: (12, 8), (13, 7).
            *   Sorted Markers: [(3, 12), (4, 12)]
            *   Sorted Anchors: [(12, 8), (13, 7)]
            *   Pair 1: Anchor (12, 8), Marker (3, 12). Offset = (-9, 4). Copy Obj2 offset by (-9, 4).
            *   Pair 2: Anchor (13, 7), Marker (4, 12). Offset = (-9, 5). Copy Obj2 offset by (-9, 5).
    *   Execution (Markers sorted order: (3,12)A, (4,12)A, (10,14)Y):
        1. Copy Obj2 offset by (-9, 4). (Top-left -> (3, 10)).
        2. Copy Obj2 offset by (-9, 5). (Top-left -> (3, 11)). This overwrites parts of the previous copy.
        3. Copy Obj1 offset by (7, 10). (Top-left -> (9, 13)).
    *   Let's compare the final state with the output:
        *   Output has Obj1 at original place.
        *   Output has Obj2 at original place.
        *   Output has Obj1 copy starting at (9, 13). Matches step 3.
        *   Output has Obj2 copy starting at (3, 11). Matches step 2.
        *   The marker pixels themselves are overwritten by the copies in the output. Azure(3,12) becomes Green(3), Azure(4,12) becomes Azure(8), Yellow(10,14) becomes Yellow(4). This seems consistent.
    *   This rule works for Example 1!

*   Applying Rule Attempt 4 to Example 2:
    *   Complex Objects: Obj1 (Red/Yellow/Azure). Top-left (1,1).
    *   Markers: Yellow(4) at (9, 6), Azure(8) at (11, 8).
    *   Color Analysis:
        *   Red(2): Only in Obj1. No markers. No copy.
        *   Yellow(4): Only in Obj1. Markers: (9, 6). Anchors in Obj1: (2, 2), (3, 3).
            *   Sorted Markers: [(9, 6)]
            *   Sorted Anchors: [(2, 2), (3, 3)]
            *   Pair 1: Anchor (2, 2), Marker (9, 6). Offset = (7, 4). Copy Obj1 offset by (7, 4).
        *   Azure(8): Only in Obj1. Markers: (11, 8). Anchors in Obj1: (4, 4).
            *   Sorted Markers: [(11, 8)]
            *   Sorted Anchors: [(4, 4)]
            *   Pair 1: Anchor (4, 4), Marker (11, 8). Offset = (7, 4). Copy Obj1 offset by (7, 4).
    *   Execution (Markers sorted order: (9,6)Y, (11,8)A):
        1. Copy Obj1 offset by (7, 4). (Top-left -> (8, 5)).
        2. Copy Obj1 offset by (7, 4). (Top-left -> (8, 5)). This overwrites the previous copy exactly.
    *   Final state has original Obj1 and one copy at (8, 5). This matches the output. Rule works for Example 2!

*   Applying Rule Attempt 4 to Example 3:
    *   Complex Objects: Obj1 (Blue/Red/Green) TL=(1,0), Obj2 (Red) TL=(3,10), Obj3 (Red) TL=(8,5).
    *   Markers: None found previously. Let's re-check edge-connectivity for all non-background=8 pixels.
        *   Blue(1) at (1,0): Neighbors N/A, S=(2,0)Bkg, E=(1,1)Bkg, W=N/A. Isolated? Yes. Marker!
        *   Red(2) at (2,1): Neighbors N=(1,1)Bkg, S=(3,1)Bkg, E=(2,2)Bkg, W=(2,0)Bkg. Isolated? Yes. Marker!
        *   Blue(1) at (2,3): Neighbors N=(1,3)Bkg, S=(3,3)B, E=(2,4)Bkg, W=(2,2)Bkg. Isolated? No, connected to Blue(3,3).
        *   Red(2) at (3,2): Neighbors N=(2,2)Bkg, S=(4,2)B, E=(3,3)B, W=(3,1)Bkg. Isolated? No, connected to Blue(4,2) and Blue(3,3).
        *   Blue(1) at (3,3): Neighbors N=(2,3)B, S=(4,3)G, E=(3,4)Bkg, W=(3,2)R. Isolated? No.
        *   Blue(1) at (4,1): Neighbors N=(3,1)Bkg, S=(5,1)Bkg, E=(4,2)B, W=(4,0)Bkg. Isolated? No, connected to Blue(4,2).
        *   Blue(1) at (4,2): Neighbors N=(3,2)R, S=(5,2)Bkg, E=(4,3)G, W=(4,1)B. Isolated? No.
        *   Green(3) at (4,3): Neighbors N=(3,3)B, S=(5,3)Bkg, E=(4,4)Bkg, W=(4,2)B. Isolated? No.
        *   Red(2) at (3,10): Neighbors N=(2,10)Bkg, S=(4,10)Bkg, E=(3,11)Bkg, W=(3,9)Bkg. Isolated? Yes. Marker!
        *   Red(2) at (4,11): Neighbors N=(3,11)Bkg, S=(5,11)Bkg, E=(4,12)R, W=(4,10)Bkg. Isolated? No, connected to Red(4,12).
        *   Red(2) at (3,10) again? Hmm, input shows R at (3,10). R at (4,11). R at (8,5). R at (9,6). Let's use the actual input image for Example 3.
        Input 3:
        
```
        8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
        1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8  <-- Blue(1) at (1,0). Isolated. Marker.
        8 2 8 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8  <-- Red(2) at (2,1). Isolated. Marker. Blue(1) at (2,3). Isolated. Marker.

        8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
        8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
        ```

        My interpretation of connectivity seems flawed. Let's use the definition: "An object can be considered a contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same color." And "adjacency is very important - side by side and diagonal". Okay, connectivity includes diagonals. "Complex object" vs "Marker" distinction needs diagonal connectivity.

*   Recalculating Components (Diagonal Connectivity) Example 3:
    *   Component 1: Blue(1) at (1,0). Neighbors (diag included): R(2,1). Connects.
    *   R(2,1): Neighbors: B(1,0), B(2,3), R(3,2). Connects.
    *   B(2,3): Neighbors: R(2,1), R(3,2), B(3,3), B(4,2). Connects.
    *   R(3,2): Neighbors: R(2,1), B(2,3), B(3,3), B(4,1), B(4,2), G(4,3). Connects.
    *   B(3,3): Neighbors: B(2,3), R(3,2), B(4,2), G(4,3). Connects.
    *   B(4,1): Neighbors: R(3,2), B(4,2). Connects.
    *   B(4,2): Neighbors: B(2,3), R(3,2), B(3,3), B(4,1), G(4,3). Connects.
    *   G(4,3): Neighbors: R(3,2), B(3,3), B(4,2). Connects.
    *   All these pixels (1,0)B, (2,1)R, (2,3)B, (3,2)R, (3,3)B, (4,1)B, (4,2)B, (4,3)G form ONE complex object (Obj1).
    *   Component 2: R(3,10). Neighbors: None non-background. Size 1. Marker.
    *   Component 3: R(4,11). Neighbors: None non-background. Size 1. Marker.
    *   Component 4: R(8,5). Neighbors: R(9,6). Connects.
    *   R(9,6): Neighbors: R(8,5). Connects.
    *   This R(8,5), R(9,6) forms a second complex object (Obj2).
*   Okay, Example 3 Components (using diagonal connectivity):
    *   Complex Objects: Obj1 (multi-color, TL approx (1,0)), Obj2 (Red, TL (8,5)).
    *   Markers (Size 1 components): Red(2) at (3, 10), Red(2) at (4, 11).
    *   Color Analysis:
        *   Blue(1): Only in Obj1. No markers. No copy.
        *   Red(2): In Obj1 and Obj2. Count is 2. Not unique. No copy triggered by Red markers.
        *   Green(3): Only in Obj1. No markers. No copy.
*   According to Rule Attempt 4, *no copies* should be made in Example 3. But the output clearly shows copies. This rule is incorrect.

Let's rethink the trigger. What is special about the locations where copies appear?
*   Ex1: Copies appear anchored relative to the *original* locations of the single Azure pixels (3,12)/(4,12) and the single Yellow pixel (10,14).
*   Ex2: Copy appears anchored relative to the *original* locations of the single Yellow (9,6) and Azure (11,8).
*   Ex3: Copies appear anchored relative to the *original* locations of the single Red pixels (3,10), (4,11), (8,5), (9,6). Wait, (8,5) and (9,6) were identified as a complex object (Obj2) just now.

Maybe the distinction isn't complex vs simple. Maybe it's about finding pairs of identical shapes?
No, the shapes being copied are not identical to the single pixels.

What if *every* non-background object provides an anchor point, and *every other* non-background object of the same color provides a potential destination?

Let's reconsider the core idea: Copying objects based on color matching between a point inside the object (anchor) and a point outside (destination/trigger).

What defines the 'destination' points?
*   Ex1: Pixels (3,12)A, (4,12)A, (10,14)Y.
*   Ex2: Pixels (9,6)Y, (11,8)A.
*   Ex3: Pixels (1,0)B, (2,1)R, (2,3)B, (3,2)R, (3,3)B, (3,10)R, (4,1)B, (4,2)B, (4,3)G, (4,11)R, (8,5)R, (9,6)R. It seems *all* non-background pixels in Ex3 might be involved.

Let's look at the Ex3 output again carefully.
Output 3:

```
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8  // Orig B(1,0)
8 2 8 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8  // Orig R(2,1), B(2,3). New B(2,9)
8 8 2 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8 1  // Orig R(3,2), B(3,3). New R(3,10), B(3,12)
8 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 1  // Orig B(4,1), B(4,2). Orig G(4,3) erased? New R(4,11), B(4,12)
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 3  // New Obj1 copy appears here. TL approx (5, 10)
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8  // New B(7,4)

8 8 8 8 8 8 2 1 8 8 8 8 8  // Orig R(9,6). New B(9,7)
8 8 8 8 8 1 1 3 8 8 8 8 8  // New Obj1 copy appears here. TL approx (10, 5)
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
```

Observations on Ex3 Output:
*   The original multi-color object (Obj1) seems to be copied twice.
*   The original Red object (Obj2 at (8,5), (9,6)) seems to remain.
*   The single Red markers R(3,10) and R(4,11) from the input are gone in the output, replaced by parts of a copied Obj1.
*   There are new Blue pixels: (2,9), (3,12), (4,12), (7,4), (8,7), (9,7). These don't seem to form a copy of Obj1. Where do they come from?
*   The copies of Obj1 seem anchored differently.
    *   Copy 1 (TL approx (5,10)): Contains B(5,10), R(6,11), B(6,13), R(7,12), B(7,13), B(8,11), B(8,12), G(8,13). This looks like Obj1 rotated/flipped? No, shape matches Obj1. Let's find anchor/destination. If Green(G) is the anchor: Anchor G(4,3) in original Obj1. Destination G(8,13) in copy. Offset = (4, 10). Apply to Obj1 TL (1,0) -> (5, 10). This matches Copy 1 TL. What triggered this copy? Maybe R(3,10) or R(4,11)? Let's test R(3,10) as destination. Anchor must be Red. Anchors in Obj1: R(2,1), R(3,2).
        *   Anchor R(2,1) -> Dest R(3,10). Offset (1, 9). Obj1 TL (1,0) -> (2, 9). Doesn't match Copy 1.
        *   Anchor R(3,2) -> Dest R(3,10). Offset (0, 8). Obj1 TL (1,0) -> (1, 8). Doesn't match Copy 1.
    *   Copy 2 (TL approx (10,5)): Contains B(10,5), R(11,6), B(11,8), R(12,7), B(12,8), B(13,6), B(13,7), G(13,8). Shape matches Obj1. Anchor G(4,3) -> Dest G(1
