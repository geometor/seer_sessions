The location of each copy is determined by aligning specific pixels (\"anchors\" in the source, \"targets\" in the target components) of the same color.\n\n1.  **Find Components:** Identify all connected components of non-background pixels using 8-way (diagonal) connectivity. Record the pixels (row, col, color) for each component.\n2.  **Identify Background:** Determine the background color (most frequent color).\n3.  **Group Components by Color:** Create a mapping from each non-background color to the list of components containing that color.\n4.  **Determine Source/Target and Schedule Copies:**\n    a.  Iterate through each color `C` present in multiple components.\n    b.  Select the \"Source Component\" (`Obj_S`) for color `C`: the component with the most pixels containing `C`. Tie-breaking: largest bounding box area, then top-most, then left-most bounding box corner.\n    c.  Identify all other components containing `C` as \"Target Components\" (`T_C`).\n    d.  Extract anchor pixels `P_s` (list of (r, c)) of color `C` from `Obj_S`, sorted by row then column.\n    e.  For each `T_C`:\n        i.  Extract target pixels `P_t` (list of (r, c)) of color `C` from `T_C`, sorted by row then column.\n        ii. Pair the i-th target pixel `P_t[i]` with the i-th anchor pixel `P_s[i]`.\n        iii. Calculate the offset: `offset = P_t[i] - P_s[i]`.\n        iv. Schedule a copy: store `(P_t[i], Obj_S_pixels, offset)`, where `Obj_S_pixels` is the list of (r, c, color) tuples for the source component.\n5.  **Sort Copies:** Sort the scheduled copies based on the target pixel position (`P_t[i]`), first by row, then by column.\n6.  **Apply Copies:**\n    a.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    b.  Iterate through the sorted scheduled copies.\n    c.  For each copy `(target_pos, Obj_S_pixels, offset)`:\n        i.  For each pixel `(r_src, c_src, color)` in `Obj_S_pixels`:\n            *   Calculate destination `(dest_r, dest_c) = (r_src + offset[0], c_src + offset[1])`.\n            *   If the destination is within the grid bounds, update `output_grid[dest_r, dest_c] = color`. Overwriting is permitted.\n7.  **Return Output Grid.**\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_components(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds connected components of non-background pixels using 8-way connectivity.\"\"\"\n    background_color = np.bincount(grid.ravel()).argmax()\n    components = []\n    mask = grid != background_color\n    labeled_array, num_features = label(mask, structure=np.ones((3,3), dtype=bool))\n\n    if num_features > 0:\n        # Use find_objects to get bounding boxes, which helps iterate efficiently\n        objects_slices = find_objects(labeled_array)\n        for i in range(1, num_features + 1):\n            component_mask = labeled_array == i\n            coords = np.argwhere(component_mask)\n            component_pixels = []\n            for r, c in coords:\n                component_pixels.append((r, c, grid[r, c]))\n            if component_pixels: # Ensure component is not empty\n                 components.append(component_pixels)\n                 \n    # Sort components by top-left coordinate (min_r, then min_c) for deterministic order\n    components.sort(key=lambda comp: (min(p[0] for p in comp), min(p[1] for p in comp)))\n    return components, background_color\n\ndef get_component_properties(component):\n    \"\"\"Calculates properties of a component.\"\"\"\n    if not component:\n        return 0"
