Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with different colors. The background color is white (0).
2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), maroon (9), and magenta (6).
3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct objects. These objects are primarily composed of maroon (9) pixels, but they also contain some magenta (6) pixels within them.
4.  **Transformation:** Comparing input and output grids, the overall shapes and positions of the maroon objects remain largely the same. The key difference is the fate of the magenta (6) pixels. In the output grids, the positions previously occupied by magenta pixels *within* the maroon objects have become white (0). Magenta pixels that might exist outside of maroon objects (though none are present in these examples) would presumably remain unchanged.
5.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all three training examples. In each case, magenta pixels that are part of a larger maroon structure are replaced with white pixels.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
  - type: object
    properties:
      primary_color: maroon (9)
      secondary_color: magenta (6)
      shape: irregular clusters
      location: various positions on the grid
actions:
  - name: color_replacement
    target_color: magenta (6)
    replacement_color: white (0)
    condition: The magenta pixel must be adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one maroon (9) pixel.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The transformation depends on the adjacency (including diagonals) between magenta (6) pixels and maroon (9) pixels.
invariants:
  - Maroon (9) pixels remain unchanged.
  - White (0) pixels remain unchanged (unless they replace a magenta pixel).
  - The overall shape defined by the maroon pixels is preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the same pixel values.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid using its row and column index.
3.  If the color of the current pixel in the input grid is magenta (6):
    a.  Check all 8 neighboring pixels (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) of the current pixel.
    b.  If at least one of these neighbors has the color maroon (9):
        i.  Change the color of the corresponding pixel in the *new* grid to white (0).
4.  If the color of the current pixel in the input grid is *not* magenta (6), its value in the new grid remains unchanged from the input.
5.  The final new grid is the output.
```python
import numpy as np
