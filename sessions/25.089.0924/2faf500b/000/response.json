The background color is white (0).\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), maroon (9), and magenta (6).\n3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct objects. These objects are primarily composed of maroon (9) pixels, but they also contain some magenta (6) pixels within them.\n4.  **Transformation:** Comparing input and output grids, the overall shapes and positions of the maroon objects remain largely the same. The key difference is the fate of the magenta (6) pixels. In the output grids, the positions previously occupied by magenta pixels *within* the maroon objects have become white (0). Magenta pixels that might exist outside of maroon objects (though none are present in these examples) would presumably remain unchanged.\n5.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all three training examples. In each case, magenta pixels that are part of a larger maroon structure are replaced with white pixels.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
