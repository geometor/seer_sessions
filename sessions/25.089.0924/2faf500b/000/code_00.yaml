elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
  - type: object
    properties:
      primary_color: maroon (9)
      secondary_color: magenta (6)
      shape: irregular clusters
      location: various positions on the grid
actions:
  - name: color_replacement
    target_color: magenta (6)
    replacement_color: white (0)
    condition: The magenta pixel must be adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one maroon (9) pixel.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The transformation depends on the adjacency (including diagonals) between magenta (6) pixels and maroon (9) pixels.
invariants:
  - Maroon (9) pixels remain unchanged.
  - White (0) pixels remain unchanged (unless they replace a magenta pixel).
  - The overall shape defined by the maroon pixels is preserved.
