**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grid is consistently divided into two sections by a horizontal line of gray pixels (color 5). This line appears fixed at row index 6 (0-indexed).
2.  **Pattern Definition Area:** The top section (rows 0-5, columns 0-5, always 6x6) defines a pattern. This area is composed of 2x2 blocks of solid colors.
3.  **Layout Area:** The bottom section (starting from row 7) contains a configuration of red pixels (color 2) on a background of white pixels (color 0). This section defines where the pattern should be placed in the output. Although the input might show fewer than 6 rows below the gray line, it seems to represent a conceptual 6x6 grid.
4.  **Pattern Extraction:** A single 3x3 pattern is derived from the top 6x6 area. The color of each cell in the 3x3 pattern corresponds to the color of the top-left cell of the respective 2x2 block in the input's pattern definition area.
5.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is always 18x18, initialized with the background color (white/0).
6.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation involves using the layout area as a blueprint. Each red pixel (color 2) in the conceptual 6x6 layout area dictates the placement of the derived 3x3 pattern in the output grid.
7.  **Mapping Rule:** If a red pixel exists at relative coordinates `(r, c)` within the conceptual 6x6 layout area (where `0 <= r < 6` and `0 <= c < 6`), the 3x3 pattern is copied ("stamped") onto the 18x18 output grid such that its top-left corner is at position `(r * 3, c * 3)`.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_structure:
  - input_grid:
      parts:
        - pattern_definition:
            location: Top 6 rows (0-5), first 6 columns (0-5).
            size: 6x6
            content: Contains 3x3 grid of 2x2 solid color blocks.
            purpose: Defines the elementary pattern (tile).
        - separator:
            location: Row 6 (0-indexed).
            content: Horizontal line of gray pixels (color 5).
            purpose: Separates definition area from layout area.
        - layout_definition:
            location: Rows below separator (starting row 7), first 6 columns.
            conceptual_size: 6x6 (padded with background color 0 if needed).
            content: Configuration of red pixels (color 2) on background (color 0).
            purpose: Specifies locations for pattern placement in output.
  - output_grid:
      size: 18x18 (fixed).
      content: Background (color 0) with instances of the elementary pattern placed according to layout.

pattern:
  derivation: Extracted from the top-left pixel of each 2x2 block in the 6x6 pattern definition area.
  size: 3x3
  element: tile used for constructing the output.

layout_markers:
  color: red (2)
  location: Within the conceptual 6x6 layout area derived from the input grid below the separator.
  function: Each marker indicates a position to place the pattern in the output.

transformation:
  type: Tiling or stamping.
  scaling_factor: 3 (both height and width; layout 6x6 -> output 18x18; pattern 3x3).
  mapping: A red marker at relative layout coordinates (r, c) maps to the top-left corner (r*3, c*3) of a pattern instance in the output grid.
  output_initialization: Start with an 18x18 grid of background color (0).
  placement: Copy the 3x3 pattern onto the output grid at locations specified by the red markers. Overlapping writes are implicitly handled (last write wins, though no overlaps occur in examples).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty 18x18 output grid with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the 6x6 pattern definition area in the input grid (rows 0-5, columns 0-5).
3.  Construct a 3x3 pattern grid: For each `(i, j)` from `(0,0)` to `(2,2)`, the pattern cell `pattern[i][j]` takes the color of the input cell at `(i * 2, j * 2)`.
4.  Identify the conceptual 6x6 layout area. Read the input grid from row 7 downwards for up to 6 rows, and across the first 6 columns. Treat any area beyond the input grid's bounds within this 6x6 conceptual space as background (white, 0).
5.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the conceptual 6x6 layout area, where `r` is the row index (0 to 5) and `c` is the column index (0 to 5).
6.  Check the color of the cell `(r, c)` in the conceptual layout grid.
7.  If the color is red (2):
    a.  Calculate the top-left starting coordinates `(R, C)` for placing the pattern in the output grid: `R = r * 3`, `C = c * 3`.
    b.  Copy the 3x3 pattern onto the output grid, starting at `(R, C)`. That is, for each `(i, j)` from `(0,0)` to `(2,2)`, set the output grid cell at `(R + i, C + j)` to the color `pattern[i][j]`.
8.  Return the final 18x18 output grid.
