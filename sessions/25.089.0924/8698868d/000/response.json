            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The input grids contain distinct rectangular blocks of color. These blocks often have a primary \"frame\" color and secondary \"noise\" pixels of a different, consistent color within them. There are also other regions, sometimes less structured, that seem to serve as sources for color information.\n2.  **Color Roles**:\n    *   **Frame Color (F)**: The dominant color forming the boundary and most of the area of the main blocks (e.g., Blue(1), Yellow(4) in ex 1; Yellow(4), Green(3), Azure(8), Blue(1) in ex 2).\n    *   **Noise Color (N)**: A secondary color appearing as scattered pixels *inside* the Frame Color blocks. This Noise Color seems consistent across multiple target blocks within a single example (Azure(8) in ex 1; Red(2) in ex 2).\n    *   **Source Color (S)** or **Replacement Color (RC)**: Colors derived from other areas of the grid that are used to replace the Noise Color (N) pixels within the target blocks.\n3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves modifying the Target Blocks by changing their internal Noise Color pixels (N) to a new color derived from elsewhere in the input grid. The original Frame Color (F) of the blocks is preserved.\n4.  **Source Logic**: There seem to be two ways the replacement color is determined, corresponding to the two examples:\n    *   **Example 1 Pattern (Source Frame)**: Target blocks (Frame F, Noise N) are paired with Source blocks (Frame F_src, Noise N). The Noise N inside Target F is replaced by the Source Frame color F_src. The pairing is based on relative spatial position (Top-Left Target -> Bottom-Left Source; Top-Right Target -> Bottom-Right Source).\n    *   **Example 2 Pattern (Source Noise/Replacement Color)**: Target blocks (Frame F, Noise N) are paired with Source regions where the Noise Color N *itself* acts as a background/frame containing a *different* internal color (Replacement Color RC). The Noise N inside Target F is replaced by the Replacement Color RC found within the corresponding Source region. The pairing is again based on relative spatial position (TL Target -> TL Source Info; TR Target -> TR Source Info, etc.).\n5.  **Output Construction**: The modified target blocks are extracted and assembled into a new grid, maintaining their original relative spatial arrangement. The rest of the input grid (background, source blocks/regions) is discarded. The output grid dimensions are determined by the combined size of the modified target blocks.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Check if there are other blocks in the grid defined by a Source Frame Color (F_src) that *also* contain the same Noise Color (N). If yes, this is **Pattern A**. Record the F_src color and position for each such source block.\n    b.  If Pattern A is not found, check if there are regions where the Noise Color (N) itself acts as a background or frame, containing pixels of various other colors (Replacement Colors, RC). If yes, this is **Pattern B**. Record the Replacement Color (RC) found within N, and the position of this occurrence.\n5.  **Map Targets to Sources:** Create a one-to-one mapping between the Target Blocks and the Source Information (F_src blocks from 4a or RC colors from 4b) based on their relative spatial positions. For example, map the top-left Target Block to the top-left Source Information, the top-right Target Block to the top-right Source Information, and so on.\n6.  **Perform Transformation:**\n    a.  For each Target Block (Frame F, Noise N):\n    b.  Identify its mapped Source Information using the mapping from step 5.\n    c.  If using **Pattern A**, the replacement color is the Source Frame Color (F_src).\n    d.  If using **Pattern B**, the replacement color is the Replacement Color (RC).\n    e.  Create a copy of the Target Block. Within this copy, change all pixels of the Noise Color (N) to the determined replacement color (F_src or RC).\n7.  **Construct Output Grid:** Arrange the modified Target Block copies into a new grid. The arrangement should mirror the relative spatial positions of the original Target Blocks identified in step 3. The final output grid should contain only these modified blocks, adjacent to each other."
