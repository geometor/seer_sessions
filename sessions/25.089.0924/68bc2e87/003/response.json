It uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach starting from the\ncurrent \"outside\" pixels.\n\n1. Initialize the \"outside\" region with all azure (8) pixels.\n2. Perform a BFS starting from the current \"outside\" pixels.\n3. Identify the first non-azure (8), non-white (0) pixel encountered during the BFS. The color of this pixel\n   is the color of the next layer.\n4. Record this layer color.\n5. Find all connected pixels belonging to this layer (same color) using a flood fill (secondary BFS).\n6. \"Absorb\" this layer into the \"outside\" region by changing the color of all its pixels to azure (8) in a\n   working copy of the grid.\n7. Add the pixels of the absorbed layer to the set of pixels to start the *next* BFS from.\n8. Repeat steps 2-7 until no more non-azure, non-white pixels are found adjacent to the \"outside\" region.\n9. Output the recorded layer colors as a single-column grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_object_pixels(grid, start_r, start_c, target_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all connected pixels of a target_color starting from (start_r, start_c) using BFS.\n    Considers 8-way adjacency (including diagonals).\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The grid to search within.\n        start_r (int): Starting row.\n        start_c (int): Starting column.\n        target_color (int): The color of the object to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        set: A set of (row, col) tuples representing the pixels of the object.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    object_pixels = set()\n    queue = deque([(start_r, start_c)])\n    visited_local = set([(start_r, start_c)])\n\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        object_pixels.add((r, c))\n\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                pixel = (nr, nc)\n\n                if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and \\\n                   grid[nr, nc] == target_color and \\\n                   pixel not in visited_local:\n                    visited_local.add(pixel)\n                    queue.append(pixel)\n\n    return object_pixels\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by finding nested colored layers and outputting their colors in order.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a list of lists of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        numpy.ndarray: A 2D NumPy array representing the output grid (single column).\n    \"\"\"\n    working_grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = working_grid.shape\n    nested_colors = []\n    \n    # master_visited tracks all pixels that are part of the 'outside' (azure) or already processed layers\n    master_visited = set() \n    \n    # queue stores pixels to start the BFS expansion from (initially all azure pixels)\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize queue and visited set with all azure pixels\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if working_grid[r, c] == 8:\n                if (r, c) not in master_visited:\n                    queue.append((r, c))\n                    master_visited.add((r, c))\n\n    # Main loop: process one layer per iteration\n    while True:\n        # next_layer_candidates stores the first pixel found for each color adjacent to the current 'outside'\n        # We only need one candidate to identify the next layer's color and start the flood fill\n        next_layer_candidate = None # tuple: (color, (r, c))\n        \n        # current_expansion_queue holds pixels from the current 'outside' boundary for this BFS level\n        current_expansion_queue = queue \n        queue = deque() # Prepare queue for the *next* iteration (will be filled with absorbed layer pixels)\n        \n        processed_in_bfs_level = set() # Track pixels added to queue in this BFS level to prevent duplicates within the level\n\n        if not current_expansion_queue:\n            # If no pixels to expand from, we are done\n            break\n\n        # Perform BFS expanding from the current 'outside' region\n        while current_expansion_queue:\n            r, c = current_expansion_queue.popleft()\n\n            # Check 8 neighbors\n            for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                        continue\n                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                    pixel = (nr, nc)\n\n                    if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and pixel not in master_visited:\n                        color = working_grid[nr, nc]\n\n                        if color == 8: \n                            # Still expanding the azure 'outside', add to the next iteration's queue if not already added\n                             if pixel not in processed_in_bfs_level:\n                                queue.append(pixel) \n                                master_visited.add(pixel)\n                                processed_in_bfs_level.add(pixel)\n                        elif color != 0: \n                            # Found a non-azure, non-white pixel -
