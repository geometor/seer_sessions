The colors of these layers are collected \nin order and returned as a single-column grid.\n\nThe transformation uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach combined with flood fill:\n1. Initialize an 'outside' region comprising all azure (8) and white (0) pixels. Mark these as visited \n   and add them to a queue for BFS expansion.\n2. Iteratively expand the 'outside' region using BFS:\n   a. Process pixels from the current expansion boundary queue.\n   b. For each pixel, examine its neighbors.\n   c. If a neighbor is azure (8) or white (0) and unvisited, add it to visited and the *next* expansion queue.\n   d. If a neighbor has a different color (non-8, non-0) and is unvisited, it might be part of the next layer. \n      Mark it as visited. If it's the *first* such pixel found in this BFS level, record its color and position \n      as the 'next layer candidate'.\n3. If a 'next layer candidate' is found after exploring the current boundary:\n   a. Record the layer's color.\n   b. Perform a flood fill (e.g., another BFS) starting from the candidate pixel to find all connected pixels \n      of the same color that constitute the entire layer object.\n   c. Add all pixels belonging to this found layer object to the main visited set.\n   d. Add all pixels of the found layer object to the *next* expansion queue.\n   e. Repeat step 2 with the updated visited set and expansion queue.\n4. If no 'next layer candidate' is found during a BFS expansion level, it means no more layers are adjacent \n   to the current 'outside' region, and the process terminates.\n5. Format the collected layer colors into a single-column NumPy array.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_connected_object(grid, start_r, start_c, target_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all connected pixels of a target_color starting from (start_r, start_c) using BFS.\n    Considers 8-way adjacency (including diagonals).\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The grid to search within.\n        start_r (int): Starting row.\n        start_c (int): Starting column.\n        target_color (int): The color of the object to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        set: A set of (row, col) tuples representing the pixels of the connected object.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    object_pixels = set()\n    if grid[start_r, start_c] != target_color:\n        # Should not happen if called correctly, but good practice\n        return object_pixels \n\n    queue = deque([(start_r, start_c)])\n    visited_local = set([(start_r, start_c)]) # Track visited pixels *during this flood fill*\n\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        object_pixels.add((r, c))\n\n        # Explore 8 neighbors\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                pixel = (nr, nc)\n\n                # Check bounds, color match, and if not visited *in this specific flood fill*\n                if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and \\\n                   grid[nr, nc] == target_color and \\\n                   pixel not in visited_local:\n                    visited_local.add(pixel)\n                    queue.append(pixel)\n\n    return object_pixels\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by finding nested colored layers and outputting their colors in order.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a list of lists of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        numpy.ndarray: A 2D NumPy array representing the output grid (single column).\n    \"\"\"\n    working_grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = working_grid.shape\n    nested_colors = []\n    \n    # visited tracks all pixels that are part of the 'outside' region (initial 8s/0s + absorbed layers)\n    visited = set() \n    \n    # queue stores pixels for the *next* BFS expansion boundary\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # 1.
