"""
Identifies nested layers of colors in a grid, starting from the outermost layer adjacent to the initial 
azure (8) or white (0) background pixels, and proceeds inwards. The colors of these layers are collected 
in order and returned as a single-column grid.

The transformation uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach combined with flood fill:
1. Initialize an 'outside' region comprising all azure (8) and white (0) pixels. Mark these as visited 
   and add them to a queue for BFS expansion.
2. Iteratively expand the 'outside' region using BFS:
   a. Process pixels from the current expansion boundary queue.
   b. For each pixel, examine its neighbors.
   c. If a neighbor is azure (8) or white (0) and unvisited, add it to visited and the *next* expansion queue.
   d. If a neighbor has a different color (non-8, non-0) and is unvisited, it might be part of the next layer. 
      Mark it as visited. If it's the *first* such pixel found in this BFS level, record its color and position 
      as the 'next layer candidate'.
3. If a 'next layer candidate' is found after exploring the current boundary:
   a. Record the layer's color.
   b. Perform a flood fill (e.g., another BFS) starting from the candidate pixel to find all connected pixels 
      of the same color that constitute the entire layer object.
   c. Add all pixels belonging to this found layer object to the main visited set.
   d. Add all pixels of the found layer object to the *next* expansion queue.
   e. Repeat step 2 with the updated visited set and expansion queue.
4. If no 'next layer candidate' is found during a BFS expansion level, it means no more layers are adjacent 
   to the current 'outside' region, and the process terminates.
5. Format the collected layer colors into a single-column NumPy array.
