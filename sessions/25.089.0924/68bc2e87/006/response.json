            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code consistently fails on all training examples by only identifying the first (outermost) colored layer adjacent to the initial background (azure/white pixels). This indicates a flaw in the iterative process responsible for finding subsequent inner layers. The core BFS/flood-fill logic seems capable of identifying *a* layer, but the mechanism to update the 'search boundary' or 'outside region' and trigger the search for the *next* layer is not functioning correctly.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the algorithm's main loop and boundary expansion logic. Instead of trying to find a layer candidate *during* the BFS expansion of the background, we should complete the BFS expansion for the current boundary, identify the layer based on the first non-background pixel encountered, find the *entire* object of that color, record its color, and then explicitly add *all* pixels of that object to the boundary for the *next* iteration's BFS. This ensures that the search correctly starts from the newly enlarged 'outside' region in each step.\n\n**Metrics**\n"

Start the main loop, which continues as long as layers can potentially be found:\n    a.  Initialize `next_layer_candidate` to `None`. This will store `(color, (row, col))` of the first non-background pixel found.\n    b.  Initialize an empty queue, `next_boundary_queue`, to store pixels for the *next* iteration's boundary.\n    c.  Initialize an empty set `processed_in_bfs` to track pixels added to `next_boundary_queue` or identified as `next_layer_candidate` during *this* BFS expansion to avoid redundant processing within the level.\n    d.  While `current_boundary_queue` is not empty:\n        i.  Dequeue a pixel `(r, c)`.\n        ii. Examine its 8 neighbors `(nr, nc)`.\n        iii. For each neighbor:\n            1. Check if it's within grid bounds and *not* in `visited_pixels`.\n            2. Mark the neighbor `(nr, nc)` as visited by adding it to `visited_pixels`.\n            3.
