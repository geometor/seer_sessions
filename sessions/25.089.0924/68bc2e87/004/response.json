            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial approach correctly identified the core task: finding nested colored layers starting from the outermost one adjacent to the azure (8) background and proceeding inwards. However, the implementation failed to correctly iterate beyond the first layer. The BFS-based strategy seems fundamentally sound but requires correction in how the boundary (\"outside\") is expanded and how subsequent layers are identified after the first one is \"absorbed\". The key is to ensure that after identifying and absorbing a layer (by changing its pixels to azure and adding them to the visited set), the search for the *next* layer correctly initiates from the *newly formed boundary* which includes these absorbed pixels. The failure suggests the loop either terminated prematurely or the state (visited set, queue for BFS) wasn't updated correctly to allow finding inner layers.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe provided code failed on all training examples, managing only to identify the outermost colored layer adjacent to the initial azure border.\n\n| Example | Input Size (HxW) | Expected Output Colors | Actual Output Colors | Correct? | Notes                                                               |\n| :------ | :--------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 1       | 19x19            | [3, 6, 4, 2, 5]        | [3]                  | No       | Only found the outermost Green (3) layer.                         |\n| 2       | 18x19            | [2, 3, 7, 6, 9]        | [7]                  | No       | Only found the outermost Orange (7) layer. **Correction:** Should be 7 first, then 3, then 2, then 6, then 9. The previous output code is correct. My expected list was wrong. The code identified 7 correctly as the outermost. |\n| 3       | 18x19            | [2, 3, 6, 4]           | [3]                  | No       | Only found the outermost Green (3) layer. **Correction:** The outermost layer seems to be 2 (Red), not 3 (Green). The code identified 3. Need to recheck adjacency rules/starting points. |\n| 4       | 18x19            | [1, 2, 4, 6]           | [1]                  | No       | Only found the outermost Blue (1) layer.                          |\n\n*Self-Correction on Example 2 & 3 analysis:*\n*   Example 2: The outermost frame touching the border 8s *is* Orange (7). The code output `[7]` is correct for the *first* layer. The error is in not finding subsequent layers (3, 2, 6, 9).\n*   Example 3: The outermost frame touching the border 8s *is* Green (3). The code output `[3]` is correct for the *first* layer. The error is in not finding subsequent layers (2, 4, 6). My previous analysis misidentified the outermost layer.\n\nThe consistent pattern is that the code correctly finds the *single outermost* layer adjacent to the initial azure (8) pixels but fails to continue the process inwards. The issue lies in the iterative step after absorbing the first layer.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Initialize a `visited` set to keep track of pixels belonging to the 'outside' region (including already processed layers).\n4.  Initialize a `queue` for Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n5.  Add the coordinates of all initial azure (8) and white (0) pixels from the `working_grid` to both the `visited` set and the `queue`.\n6.  Start a loop that continues as long as layers are being found:\n    a.  Initialize `next_layer_candidate` to `None`. This will store `(color, (row, col))` of the first pixel of the next layer found.\n    b.  Create `current_expansion_queue` and populate it with the contents of the main `queue`. Clear the main `queue` (it will be refilled with the next boundary).\n    c.  If `current_expansion_queue` is empty, break the loop (no more pixels to expand from).\n    d.  While `current_expansion_queue` is not empty:\n        i.  Dequeue a pixel coordinate `(r, c)`.\n        ii. Check its 8 neighbours `(nr, nc)`.\n        iii. For each neighbour, if it's within grid bounds and not in the `visited` set:\n            *   Get the neighbour's color `neighbor_color`.\n            *   Add `(nr, nc)` to the `visited` set.\n            *   If `neighbor_color` is azure (8) or white (0), enqueue `(nr, nc)` into the main `queue` (for the *next* iteration's expansion).\n            *   If `neighbor_color` is *not* azure (8) or white (0) (i.e., it's a layer color) AND `next_layer_candidate` is still `None`, set `next_layer_candidate = (neighbor_color, (nr, nc))`. *Do not* enqueue this pixel yet. We only need one starting point for the layer.\n    e.  After the `current_expansion_queue` is exhausted, check if `next_layer_candidate` was found.\n        i.  If `next_layer_candidate` is `None`, break the main loop (no new layer found adjacent to the current outside).\n        ii. If `next_layer_candidate` is found:\n            *   Let `layer_color` and `start_pixel` be the color and coordinates from `next_layer_candidate`.\n            *   Append `layer_color` to the `nested_colors` list.\n            *   Perform a flood fill (e.g., BFS/DFS) starting from `start_pixel` to find all connected pixels `(obj_r, obj_c)` that have `layer_color` and have *not* yet been added to `visited` (though the start pixel was just added).
