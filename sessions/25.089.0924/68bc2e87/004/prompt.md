"""
Identifies nested layers of colors in a grid and outputs the colors in order from outermost to innermost.

The transformation works by repeatedly finding the layer of color directly adjacent to the current "outside" region,
which initially consists of all azure (8) pixels. It uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach starting from the
current "outside" pixels.

1. Initialize the "outside" region with all azure (8) pixels.
2. Perform a BFS starting from the current "outside" pixels.
3. Identify the first non-azure (8), non-white (0) pixel encountered during the BFS. The color of this pixel
   is the color of the next layer.
4. Record this layer color.
5. Find all connected pixels belonging to this layer (same color) using a flood fill (secondary BFS).
6. "Absorb" this layer into the "outside" region by changing the color of all its pixels to azure (8) in a
   working copy of the grid.
7. Add the pixels of the absorbed layer to the set of pixels to start the *next* BFS from.
8. Repeat steps 2-7 until no more non-azure, non-white pixels are found adjacent to the "outside" region.
9. Output the recorded layer colors as a single-column grid.
