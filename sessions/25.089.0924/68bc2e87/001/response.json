The colors of these identified objects are collected \nin order from outermost to innermost. The final output is a single-column grid containing these colors.\n\nWorkflow:\n1. Initialize an empty list to store the colors of the nested layers.\n2. Create a working copy of the input grid.\n3. Repeatedly find the next outermost layer:\n    a. Scan the grid for a non-azure, non-white pixel adjacent (including diagonals) to an azure pixel.\n    b. If no such pixel is found, stop.\n    c. If found, record its color. This is the color of the current layer.\n    d. Perform a flood fill (BFS) starting from the found pixel to identify all connected pixels of the same color.\n    e. Change the color of all pixels belonging to this layer to azure (8) in the working grid. This merges the layer into the \"outside\" region for the next iteration.\n4. Convert the collected list of colors into a single-column NumPy array.\n5.
