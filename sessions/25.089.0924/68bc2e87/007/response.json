The colors of these layers are collected \nin order and returned as a single-column grid.\n\nThe transformation uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to iteratively expand an 'outside' region:\n1. Initialize an 'outside' region comprising all azure (8) and white (0) pixels. Mark these as visited \n   and add them to a queue for the first BFS expansion.\n2. Iteratively perform BFS rounds:\n   a. Start a BFS using the pixels queued from the previous round (or the initial background).\n   b. During the BFS, explore neighbors of pixels from the queue.\n   c. If an unvisited neighbor is background (8/0), mark it visited and queue it for the *next* BFS round.\n   d. If an unvisited neighbor is colored (not 8/0), and no colored neighbor has been identified *in this round yet*, \n      record its color and position as the 'next layer candidate'. Mark it visited. Do not queue colored pixels \n      during the BFS expansion itself.\n   e. Continue the BFS until the current queue is empty, ensuring all reachable background pixels for the next round are queued.\n3. After a BFS round completes:\n   a. If a 'next layer candidate' was found:\n      i. Record the layer's color.\n      ii. Perform a flood fill (using a helper function) starting from the candidate pixel to find all connected pixels \n         of the same color (the complete layer object).\n      iii. Ensure all pixels of this object are marked as visited.\n      iv. Add all pixels of the found layer object to the queue for the *next* BFS round.\n   b. If no 'next layer candidate' was found and the queue for the next round is empty, the process terminates.\n4.
