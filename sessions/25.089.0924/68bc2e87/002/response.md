Okay, let's analyze the failures and refine the approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code failed because the method for identifying the "next" layer was flawed. It iterated through the grid sequentially and picked the *first* non-background pixel adjacent to the current "outside" region. This often resulted in picking pixels from inner layers prematurely or picking disconnected parts of the same layer multiple times, leading to incorrect colors and order in the output.

The core concept seems to be identifying nested layers of colors, starting from the outermost layer adjacent to the azure (8) background and moving inwards. The key challenge is correctly identifying which colored object constitutes the *next* layer in sequence.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

The revised strategy will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach starting *from* the known "outside" region (initially all azure pixels). The color of the first non-azure (8), non-white (0) pixel encountered during this expanding search will be identified as the color of the next layer. This layer (the complete contiguous object of that color) will then be "absorbed" into the "outside" region (by changing its pixels to azure), and the process repeats until no more layers are found.

**Metrics:**

Let's gather some basic metrics about the training examples to confirm our understanding.
