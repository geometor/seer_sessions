Scan the `working_grid` to find any non-azure (8), non-white (0) pixel that is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any pixel currently designated as \"outside\".\n        b.  If no such pixel is found, exit the loop.\n        c.  If found, let the color of this pixel be `C`. Identify the complete contiguous object `O` consisting of pixels of color `C` connected to the found pixel.\n        d.  Add the color `C` to the list of nested colors.\n        e.  Update the `working_grid` by changing all pixels belonging to object `O` to azure (8), effectively merging this object into the \"outside\" region for the next iteration.\n    4.  Return the collected list of nested colors, formatted as a single-column grid."
