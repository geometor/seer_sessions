The color of the frame varies across examples (maroon - 9, green - 3, yellow - 4). It appears to be the largest non-background rectangular object in the grid.\n3.  **Inner Content:** The area enclosed by the frame contains pixels of the background color (azure - 8) and pixels of at least one other color (the \"fill\" color). In the examples, this fill color is gray (5), white (0), and green (3) respectively.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is a cropped version of the input, corresponding exactly to the area defined by the frame object (including the frame itself).\n5.  **Transformation Rule:** The core transformation happens *within* the extracted frame area. Pixels that originally had the background color (azure - 8) are replaced. The replacement color is the most frequent color found *inside* the frame, excluding the frame color itself and the background color. All other pixels within the frame (the frame pixels and the original \"fill\" color pixels) remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Find the largest, contiguous, single-color rectangular frame object that is *not* the background color. Record its color (frame color) and its bounding box coordinates.\n3.  Extract the subgrid defined by the bounding box of the frame object. This subgrid forms the basis of the output grid.\n4.  Analyze the pixels *inside* the frame in the extracted subgrid (i.e., excluding the frame's border pixels).\n5.  Determine the most frequent color among these inner pixels, excluding both the frame color and the background color identified in step 1. Call this the \"fill color\".\n6.  Create the final output grid by taking the extracted subgrid from step 3 and replacing every pixel that has the background color (from step 1) with the determined \"fill color\" (from step 5).\n7.  Pixels in the extracted subgrid that were originally the frame color or the fill color remain unchanged."
