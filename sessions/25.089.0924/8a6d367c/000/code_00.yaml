Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Contains a dominant background color (azure - 8).
    - Contains multiple distinct objects.
Objects:
  - Type: Background
    Color: azure (8)
    Extent: Typically covers most of the grid area not occupied by other objects.
  - Type: Frame
    Shape: Rectangle
    Color: Varies (maroon - 9, green - 3, yellow - 4), but consistent within a single example and different from the background.
    Property: Defines the bounding box for the output grid. Appears to be the largest single-color rectangular object that isn't the background.
    Location: Lower or central part of the input grid.
  - Type: Inner_Content
    Location: Within the bounds of the Frame object (excluding the frame pixels themselves).
    Composition: Consists of pixels of the background color (azure - 8) and pixels of another dominant color ("fill" color - gray - 5, white - 0, green - 3).
  - Type: Distractor_Objects
    Location: Outside the Frame object.
    Properties: Usually small, scattered, various colors, irrelevant to the output.
Output_Grid:
  Derivation: Extracted subgrid from the Input_Grid.
  Bounding_Box: Defined by the location and dimensions of the Frame object in the Input_Grid.
  Content_Transformation:
    - Pixels matching the Input_Grid's background color (azure - 8) within the extracted area are replaced.
    - The replacement color is determined by the most frequent color within the Frame's inner content in the Input_Grid (excluding the frame color and the background color).
    - All other pixels (frame color, original fill color) within the extracted area remain unchanged.
Relationship:
  - The Output_Grid is a transformed sub-section of the Input_Grid.
  - The transformation focuses on replacing the background color pixels found *inside* the identified Frame with the dominant *non-background, non-frame* color also found inside the Frame.
