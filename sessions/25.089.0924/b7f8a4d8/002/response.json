            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: locate framed objects, check their inner \"trigger\" color, and add new shapes based on that trigger. However, the code generated based on this analysis failed because the exact shapes, sizes, and positions of the *added* elements were incorrectly generalized from the first example or incompletely observed.\n\nThe errors indicate that the specific transformation rule (the shapes added) varies significantly depending on both the *type* of framed object (identified by border color/size) and the *trigger* color found inside.\n\nThe strategy is to re-examine each training example's input and output pair meticulously, focusing specifically on the pixels that are *added* in the output compared to the input. We need to precisely define the geometry and placement of these added elements relative to the triggering object for each distinct case observed across the examples.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nLet's analyze the differences between input and output for each example to precisely identify the added elements.\n\n"
