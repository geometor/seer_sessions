These objects typically consist of a border of one color surrounding an inner area containing pixels of another color (or colors). The transformation rule depends on the color(s) found within the inner area of these identified objects. If the inner color matches certain criteria (acting as a \"trigger\"), new shapes are drawn in the empty (white) space adjacent to the original object. The color of the newly drawn shapes is determined by the trigger color. The original objects remain unchanged in the output. The placement and shape of the new elements seem specific to the structure and trigger color found in each example.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Check if this inner color matches the predefined \"trigger\" color(s) for the task (e.g., Azure/Yellow in Ex1, Green/Blue in Ex2, Green in Ex3).\n    c.  If the inner color is a trigger color:\n        i.  Determine the shape(s), size(s), and relative position(s) of the new element(s) to be added, based on the specific rules associated with that trigger color and object type for the task. The color of the new element(s) will be the trigger color.\n        ii. Draw these new element(s) onto the corresponding locations in the output grid. Ensure drawing occurs only in cells that were originally white (0) in the input grid to avoid overwriting existing objects.\n4.  Return the modified output grid."
