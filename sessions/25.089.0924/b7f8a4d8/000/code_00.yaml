Task: Add shapes based on inner colors of framed objects.

Commonalities:
  - Input grids contain repeating patterns/objects separated by white (0) space.
  - Objects often have a distinct border color and an inner content area.
  - The transformation adds new shapes to the white space; original objects are preserved.
  - The trigger for adding shapes is the color of the pixel(s) in the inner content area of an object.
  - The color of the added shapes matches the trigger color.
  - The position and form of the added shapes are relative to the location of the triggering object.

Example_1:
  - Objects:
      - Type: Framed Square
      - Border: 5x5 Green (3)
      - Inner Content: 2x2 block at the center of the 5x5 frame.
      - Inner Colors observed: Red (2), Azure (8), Yellow (4)
  - Trigger Colors: Azure (8), Yellow (4)
  - Action:
      - If Inner Color is Azure (8) or Yellow (4):
          - Add a 2x2 block of the Inner Color.
          - Position: Immediately to the right of the 5x5 frame (starting 1 column after the frame ends), vertically aligned with the inner 2x2 block.
  - No Action Color: Red (2)

Example_2:
  - Objects:
      - Type: Framed Pixel
      - Border: 3x3 Red (2)
      - Inner Content: 1x1 pixel at the center.
      - Inner Colors observed: Yellow (4), Green (3), Blue (1)
  - Trigger Colors: Green (3), Blue (1)
  - Action:
      - If Inner Color is Green (3) or Blue (1):
          - Add two separate 1x2 vertical lines of the Inner Color.
          - Position 1: Two columns to the right of the center pixel's column, vertically aligned with the center pixel's row and the row below it.
          - Position 2: Four columns to the right of the center pixel's column, vertically aligned with the center pixel's row and the row below it.
  - No Action Color: Yellow (4)

Example_3:
  - Objects:
      - Type: Framed Pixel
      - Border: 3x3 Blue (1)
      - Inner Content: 1x1 pixel at the center.
      - Inner Colors observed: Red (2), Green (3)
  - Trigger Colors: Green (3)
  - Action:
      - If Inner Color is Green (3):
          - Add a 3x3 block of Green (3).
          - Position 1: Immediately to the right of the 3x3 frame (starting 1 column after the frame ends), vertically aligned with the frame.
          - Add a 1x3 vertical line of Green (3).
          - Position 2: Immediately below the 3x3 frame (starting 1 row after the frame ends), horizontally aligned with the center column of the frame.
  - No Action Color: Red (2)
