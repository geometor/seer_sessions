Okay, let's break down the perception, facts, and the natural language program for these examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves identifying specific composite objects within the input grid. These objects typically consist of a border of one color surrounding an inner area containing pixels of another color (or colors). The transformation rule depends on the color(s) found within the inner area of these identified objects. If the inner color matches certain criteria (acting as a "trigger"), new shapes are drawn in the empty (white) space adjacent to the original object. The color of the newly drawn shapes is determined by the trigger color. The original objects remain unchanged in the output. The placement and shape of the new elements seem specific to the structure and trigger color found in each example.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Task: Add shapes based on inner colors of framed objects.

Commonalities:
  - Input grids contain repeating patterns/objects separated by white (0) space.
  - Objects often have a distinct border color and an inner content area.
  - The transformation adds new shapes to the white space; original objects are preserved.
  - The trigger for adding shapes is the color of the pixel(s) in the inner content area of an object.
  - The color of the added shapes matches the trigger color.
  - The position and form of the added shapes are relative to the location of the triggering object.

Example_1:
  - Objects:
      - Type: Framed Square
      - Border: 5x5 Green (3)
      - Inner Content: 2x2 block at the center of the 5x5 frame.
      - Inner Colors observed: Red (2), Azure (8), Yellow (4)
  - Trigger Colors: Azure (8), Yellow (4)
  - Action:
      - If Inner Color is Azure (8) or Yellow (4):
          - Add a 2x2 block of the Inner Color.
          - Position: Immediately to the right of the 5x5 frame (starting 1 column after the frame ends), vertically aligned with the inner 2x2 block.
  - No Action Color: Red (2)

Example_2:
  - Objects:
      - Type: Framed Pixel
      - Border: 3x3 Red (2)
      - Inner Content: 1x1 pixel at the center.
      - Inner Colors observed: Yellow (4), Green (3), Blue (1)
  - Trigger Colors: Green (3), Blue (1)
  - Action:
      - If Inner Color is Green (3) or Blue (1):
          - Add two separate 1x2 vertical lines of the Inner Color.
          - Position 1: Two columns to the right of the center pixel's column, vertically aligned with the center pixel's row and the row below it.
          - Position 2: Four columns to the right of the center pixel's column, vertically aligned with the center pixel's row and the row below it.
  - No Action Color: Yellow (4)

Example_3:
  - Objects:
      - Type: Framed Pixel
      - Border: 3x3 Blue (1)
      - Inner Content: 1x1 pixel at the center.
      - Inner Colors observed: Red (2), Green (3)
  - Trigger Colors: Green (3)
  - Action:
      - If Inner Color is Green (3):
          - Add a 3x3 block of Green (3).
          - Position 1: Immediately to the right of the 3x3 frame (starting 1 column after the frame ends), vertically aligned with the frame.
          - Add a 1x3 vertical line of Green (3).
          - Position 2: Immediately below the 3x3 frame (starting 1 row after the frame ends), horizontally aligned with the center column of the frame.
  - No Action Color: Red (2)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to locate all instances of the primary framed objects specific to the task (e.g., 5x5 green borders in Ex1, 3x3 red borders in Ex2, 3x3 blue borders in Ex3).
3.  For each identified framed object:
    a.  Determine the color(s) of the pixels in its specific inner content area (e.g., the central 2x2 block in Ex1, the central 1x1 pixel in Ex2 & Ex3).
    b.  Check if this inner color matches the predefined "trigger" color(s) for the task (e.g., Azure/Yellow in Ex1, Green/Blue in Ex2, Green in Ex3).
    c.  If the inner color is a trigger color:
        i.  Determine the shape(s), size(s), and relative position(s) of the new element(s) to be added, based on the specific rules associated with that trigger color and object type for the task. The color of the new element(s) will be the trigger color.
        ii. Draw these new element(s) onto the corresponding locations in the output grid. Ensure drawing occurs only in cells that were originally white (0) in the input grid to avoid overwriting existing objects.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
