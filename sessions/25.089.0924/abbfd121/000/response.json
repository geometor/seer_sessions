These blocks overwrite the underlying pattern.\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is a rectangular subgrid extracted from the input.\n4.  **Content Preservation:** The output grid contains only colors belonging to the input's background pattern; the colors from the \"noise blocks\" are excluded.\n5.  **Extraction Logic:** The output seems to be a \"clean\" sample of the background pattern, extracted from the top-left region of the input grid.\n6.  **Size Determination:** The dimensions (height H, width W) of the output grid appear to be determined by the dimensions of the largest \"noise block\" (the one with the greatest area) found in the input. Specifically:\n    *   The output height matches the height of the largest noise block.\n    *   The output width matches the width of the largest noise block *unless* that block is not square, in which case the output width is one less than the block's width.\n7.  **Position Determination:** The extraction point (top-left corner) for the output subgrid seems to correspond to the top-left starting point of the fundamental repeating unit of the background pattern within the input grid (e.g., (0,0) or (1,1)).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Keep track of their colors, locations, and dimensions (height H, width W).\n2.  Determine the set of \"noise colors\" used by these blocks. All other colors present in the grid are considered \"background colors\".\n3.  Calculate the area (H * W) for each identified noise block.\n4.  Find the noise block with the largest area. Let its dimensions be H_max x W_max.\n5.  Calculate the dimensions of the output grid (H_out x W_out):\n    a.  Set H_out = H_max.\n    b.  If H_max is equal to W_max (the largest noise block is square), set W_out = W_max.\n    c.  If H_max is not equal to W_max (the largest noise block is not square), set W_out = W_max - 1.\n6.  Identify the starting coordinates (r_start, c_start) of the fundamental repeating unit of the background pattern in the top-left region of the input grid (this is typically (0,0) or (1,1) based on the examples).\n7.  Extract the subgrid from the input grid starting at (r_start, c_start) with dimensions H_out x W_out. This subgrid is the final output."
