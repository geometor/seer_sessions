elements:
  - role: background
    description: A repeating pattern of pixels forming the base layer of the input grid.
    properties:
      - composed_of: specific set of colors (e.g., {3,4,5,6} in ex1; {0,1,2} in ex2; {4,5,6} in ex3)
      - structure: typically a small rectangular unit repeated across the grid
  - role: noise
    description: Solid, monochromatic rectangular blocks overlaying the background pattern.
    properties:
      - shape: rectangle
      - content: single color, distinct from background colors
      - size: variable (e.g., 5x6, 7x7 in ex1; 10x10, 6x6 in ex2; 3x3, 6x6, 6x13 in ex3)
      - count: one or more per input grid
  - role: output_grid
    description: The target grid generated from the input.
    properties:
      - content: subset of the input grid's background pattern
      - origin: extracted from the top-left region of the input grid
      - size: determined by the largest noise block in the input

relationships:
  - type: determines_size
    source: largest noise block (by area)
    target: output_grid
    details: >
      Let the largest noise block have dimensions H x W.
      Output height is H.
      Output width is W if H == W (block is square).
      Output width is W - 1 if H != W (block is not square).
  - type: determines_content
    source: background pattern
    target: output_grid
    details: The output grid is composed solely of pixels matching the background pattern colors.
  - type: determines_location
    source: background pattern start coordinate
    target: output_grid extraction point
    details: The top-left corner for extracting the output subgrid corresponds to the top-left corner (r_start, c_start) where the repeating unit of the background pattern begins in the input grid.

actions:
  - IdentifyNoiseBlocks: Find all maximal monochromatic rectangular regions larger than 1x1.
  - IdentifyLargestNoiseBlock: Select the noise block with the maximum area (height * width).
  - CalculateOutputDimensions: Compute the target H_out and W_out based on the largest noise block's dimensions and shape (square vs. non-square).
  - FindPatternStart: Determine the (r_start, c_start) coordinates of the top-left instance of the background pattern's repeating unit.
  - ExtractSubgrid: Copy the portion of the input grid from `input[r_start : r_start + H_out, c_start : c_start + W_out]`.
