            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core concept: objects on the border move based on color frequency. However, the specific movement rule was wrong. The examples show that the 'moving' objects don't just shift one pixel diagonally; they shift by a distance equal to their own dimension (height/width), maintaining their shape, diagonally towards the center. The stationary objects remain untouched.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the background color identification.\n2.  Confirm the border object identification and counting mechanism.\n3.  Confirm the 'moving color' selection rule (highest count, lowest value tie-break).\n4.  Implement the corrected movement logic: calculate the object's dimensions (assuming square for now based on examples) and apply a shift of `(\u00b1dimension, \u00b1dimension)` based on corner location.\n5.  Reconstruct the output grid by placing stationary objects and shifted moving objects onto a background grid.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's gather precise data for each example to confirm the revised hypothesis.\n\n"

Determined from its bounding box.\n  moving_color: The non-background color corresponding to the highest number of distinct border_objects. If there's a tie in count, the color with the numerically lowest value is chosen.\n  stationary_color: Any non-background color that is not the moving_color.\n\ntransformation_steps:\n  - step: Identify the background_color.\n  - step: Find all distinct objects made of non-background colors.\n  - step: For each object, determine if it is a border_object and calculate its dimensions (height/width). Assume square objects for dimension calculation based on examples (use height).\n  - step: Count the number of border_objects for each non-background color.\n  - step: Determine the moving_color based on the maximum count of border_objects (lowest color value breaks ties).\n  - step: Initialize the output grid filled entirely with the background_color.\n  - step: Iterate through all found objects:\n      - if the object's color is the moving_color AND it is a border_object:\n          - determine its corner proximity (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).\n          - get its dimension (e.g., height).\n          - calculate the shift vector based on the corner:\n              - Top-left: (+dimension, +dimension)\n              - Top-right: (+dimension, -dimension)\n              - Bottom-left: (-dimension, +dimension)\n              - Bottom-right: (-dimension, -dimension)\n          - redraw the object by applying the shift vector to each of its original coordinates, placing the object's color at the new coordinates in the output grid.
