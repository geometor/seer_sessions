## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis correctly identified the core concept: objects on the border move based on color frequency. However, the specific movement rule was wrong. The examples show that the 'moving' objects don't just shift one pixel diagonally; they shift by a distance equal to their own dimension (height/width), maintaining their shape, diagonally towards the center. The stationary objects remain untouched.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the background color identification.
2.  Confirm the border object identification and counting mechanism.
3.  Confirm the 'moving color' selection rule (highest count, lowest value tie-break).
4.  Implement the corrected movement logic: calculate the object's dimensions (assuming square for now based on examples) and apply a shift of `(±dimension, ±dimension)` based on corner location.
5.  Reconstruct the output grid by placing stationary objects and shifted moving objects onto a background grid.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's gather precise data for each example to confirm the revised hypothesis.

The analysis confirms the pattern:
*   The background color is consistently orange (7).
*   Border objects are correctly identified.
*   The moving color is the one with the highest count of border objects (red=4 in ex1, azure=2 in ex2, maroon=3 in ex3, gray=3 in ex4). Tie-breaking wasn't needed in these examples, but the rule (lowest color value) remains plausible.
*   The moving objects are always square in these examples (1x1, 4x4, 3x3, 2x2).
*   The dimension (`dim`) corresponds to the height/width of the moving object. This dimension dictates the shift distance.
*   Stationary objects are those whose color is not the moving color, even if they are on the border.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Selectively move border objects towards the center based on color frequency at the borders, with the movement distance determined by the object's size.

definitions:
  background_color: The color that occupies the most cells in the input grid (orange, 7 in examples).
  object: A contiguous block of cells of the same non-background color (using 4-way connectivity).
  border_object: An object where at least one of its cells touches the outer edge (border) of the grid.
  object_dimension: The height (or width) of a square object. Determined from its bounding box.
  moving_color: The non-background color corresponding to the highest number of distinct border_objects. If there's a tie in count, the color with the numerically lowest value is chosen.
  stationary_color: Any non-background color that is not the moving_color.

transformation_steps:
  - step: Identify the background_color.
  - step: Find all distinct objects made of non-background colors.
  - step: For each object, determine if it is a border_object and calculate its dimensions (height/width). Assume square objects for dimension calculation based on examples (use height).
  - step: Count the number of border_objects for each non-background color.
  - step: Determine the moving_color based on the maximum count of border_objects (lowest color value breaks ties).
  - step: Initialize the output grid filled entirely with the background_color.
  - step: Iterate through all found objects:
      - if the object's color is the moving_color AND it is a border_object:
          - determine its corner proximity (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
          - get its dimension (e.g., height).
          - calculate the shift vector based on the corner:
              - Top-left: (+dimension, +dimension)
              - Top-right: (+dimension, -dimension)
              - Bottom-left: (-dimension, +dimension)
              - Bottom-right: (-dimension, -dimension)
          - redraw the object by applying the shift vector to each of its original coordinates, placing the object's color at the new coordinates in the output grid. Ensure coordinates stay within grid bounds.
      - else (object is stationary):
          - redraw the object at its original coordinates in the output grid using its original color.

input_output_relationship:
  grid_size: Preserved between input and output.
  background: Fills the output grid initially and replaces the original positions of moved objects.
  moving_objects: Shift position diagonally inwards by a distance equal to their dimension. Shape is preserved.
  stationary_objects: Remain in their original positions.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the most frequent color in the input grid; this is the `background_color`.
2.  Find all connected groups (objects) of pixels that are not the `background_color`.
3.  For each object found:
    *   Record its color.
    *   Determine if it touches the border of the grid (is a `border_object`).
    *   Calculate its height and width (these are equal in the training examples). Store this dimension.
    *   Determine which corner it is nearest to (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) if it is a `border_object`.
4.  Count how many `border_objects` exist for each distinct non-background color.
5.  Find the color(s) that have the highest count of `border_objects`. If there is a tie, select the color with the smallest numerical value. This is the `moving_color`.
6.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the `background_color`.
7.  Iterate through all the objects identified in step 2:
    *   If an object's color is the `moving_color` AND it is a `border_object`:
        *   Get its dimension (e.g., height).
        *   Calculate the row shift (`dr`) and column shift (`dc`):
            *   If corner is top-left: `dr = dimension`, `dc = dimension`.
            *   If corner is top-right: `dr = dimension`, `dc = -dimension`.
            *   If corner is bottom-left: `dr = -dimension`, `dc = dimension`.
            *   If corner is bottom-right: `dr = -dimension`, `dc = -dimension`.
        *   For each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to this object, calculate the new position `(nr, nc) = (r + dr, c + dc)`.
        *   If the new position `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries, set the color of the output grid at `(nr, nc)` to the object's color.
    *   Else (the object is stationary):
        *   For each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to this object, set the color of the output grid at `(r, c)` to the object's color.
8.  Return the final output grid.
