task_description: Selectively move objects towards the center based on color frequency at the borders.

definitions:
  background_color: The color that occupies the most cells in the input grid (typically orange, 7).
  border_object: A contiguous block of cells of the same non-background color, where at least one cell touches the outer edge (border) of the grid.
  moving_color: The non-background color that corresponds to the highest number of distinct border objects.
  stationary_color: Any non-background color that is not the moving_color.

transformation_steps:
  - step: Identify the background_color.
  - step: Find all distinct border_objects in the input grid.
  - step: Count the number of border_objects for each non-background color.
  - step: Determine the moving_color (the color with the maximum count of border_objects).
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but fill all non-background cells with the background_color. This preserves stationary objects and prepares empty space.
  - step: For each border_object whose color is the moving_color:
      - determine its position (e.g., top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right based on proximity to corners).
      - calculate the new position by shifting every pixel of the object one step diagonally inwards (towards the grid center).
        - Top-left objects move down and right (+1 row, +1 col).
        - Top-right objects move down and left (+1 row, -1 col).
        - Bottom-left objects move up and right (-1 row, +1 col).
        - Bottom-right objects move up and left (-1 row, -1 col).
      - redraw the object at its new calculated position in the output grid using its original color.
  - step: For each border_object whose color is a stationary_color:
      - redraw the object at its original position in the output grid using its original color.

input_output_relationship:
  grid_size: Preserved between input and output.
  background: Remains largely the same, fills vacated spots.
  moving_objects: Shift position one step diagonally inwards.
  stationary_objects: Remain in their original positions.
