Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve square or rectangular grids. The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
2.  **Background Color:** There's a dominant background color in all examples, which is orange (7).
3.  **Objects:** In each input grid, there are distinct, solid-colored objects, usually located near or touching the corners/borders. These objects are made of colors other than the background color.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves selectively moving some of these objects. Objects that move always shift one position diagonally inwards, towards the center of the grid. The original position of the moved object is filled with the background color. Not all objects necessarily move.
5.  **Movement Rule:** By comparing the examples, it appears that the color of the objects determines whether they move.
    *   In `train_1`, only red (2) objects exist (besides background), and they move.
    *   In `train_2`, azure (8), maroon (9), and blue (1) objects exist. Only the azure objects move. Azure appears twice (top-left, top-right), while maroon and blue appear once.
    *   In `train_3`, maroon (9) and red (2) objects exist. Only the maroon objects move. Maroon appears three times, while red appears once.
    *   In `train_4`, gray (5) and maroon (9) objects exist. Only the gray objects move. Gray appears three times, while maroon appears once.
6.  **Conclusion on Movement:** The rule seems to be: identify all non-background objects touching the grid border. Count how many distinct objects of each color exist on the border. The color with the highest count is the "moving" color. All objects of this moving color shift one step diagonally inwards. Objects of other non-background colors remain stationary.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Selectively move objects towards the center based on color frequency at the borders.

definitions:
  background_color: The color that occupies the most cells in the input grid (typically orange, 7).
  border_object: A contiguous block of cells of the same non-background color, where at least one cell touches the outer edge (border) of the grid.
  moving_color: The non-background color that corresponds to the highest number of distinct border objects.
  stationary_color: Any non-background color that is not the moving_color.

transformation_steps:
  - step: Identify the background_color.
  - step: Find all distinct border_objects in the input grid.
  - step: Count the number of border_objects for each non-background color.
  - step: Determine the moving_color (the color with the maximum count of border_objects).
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but fill all non-background cells with the background_color. This preserves stationary objects and prepares empty space.
  - step: For each border_object whose color is the moving_color:
      - determine its position (e.g., top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right based on proximity to corners).
      - calculate the new position by shifting every pixel of the object one step diagonally inwards (towards the grid center).
        - Top-left objects move down and right (+1 row, +1 col).
        - Top-right objects move down and left (+1 row, -1 col).
        - Bottom-left objects move up and right (-1 row, +1 col).
        - Bottom-right objects move up and left (-1 row, -1 col).
      - redraw the object at its new calculated position in the output grid using its original color.
  - step: For each border_object whose color is a stationary_color:
      - redraw the object at its original position in the output grid using its original color.

input_output_relationship:
  grid_size: Preserved between input and output.
  background: Remains largely the same, fills vacated spots.
  moving_objects: Shift position one step diagonally inwards.
  stationary_objects: Remain in their original positions.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the background color by finding the most frequent color in the input grid.
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
3.  Identify all contiguous groups of non-background colored pixels (objects) that touch the border of the input grid.
4.  Count how many separate border objects exist for each distinct non-background color.
5.  Identify the 'moving color' - this is the non-background color that has the highest count of border objects found in the previous step.
6.  Iterate through all pixels of the input grid.
7.  If a pixel belongs to an object whose color is the 'moving color' *and* that object touches the border:
    *   Determine the direction of inward diagonal movement based on the object's corner proximity (e.g., a top-left object moves down-right, a top-right object moves down-left, etc.).
    *   Change the pixel's original location in the output grid to the background color.
    *   Change the pixel's corresponding diagonally inward location in the output grid to the 'moving color'.
8.  Leave all pixels belonging to the background color or stationary (non-moving) objects unchanged from the initial copy.
9.  Return the modified output grid.
