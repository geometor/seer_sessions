Record their colors and top-left positions. Sort the colors based on position (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).\n3.  **Extract Values:** Find all 5x5 patterns in the TR zone. Record the patterns (as 5x5 numpy arrays) and their top-left positions. Sort the patterns based on position. Assume patterns are exactly 5x5 starting from the detected top-left corner.\n4.  **Establish Mapping:** Create a dictionary mapping each sorted key color to the corresponding sorted value pattern. Ensure the number of keys matches the number of values.\n5.  **Extract Arrangement:** The BL zone *is* the arrangement grid.\n6.  **Construct Output:**\n    - Calculate output dimensions: (height of arrangement grid * 5) x (width of arrangement grid * 5).\n    - Initialize an output grid of this size with white (0).\n    - Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the arrangement grid:\n        - Get the `key_color` at `(r, c)`.\n        - If `key_color` is not white (0):\n            - Retrieve the corresponding `value_pattern` (5x5) from the mapping.\n            - Create a `recolored_pattern` by replacing all non-white pixels in the `value_pattern` with the `key_color`. White pixels remain white.\n            - Place this `recolored_pattern` into the output grid at the top-left position `(r * 5, c * 5)`.\n7.  **Return:** The final constructed output grid as a list of lists.\n\"\"\"\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the tiling transformation based on color-pattern mapping.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid representation.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed output grid.
