task_description: Tile a grid based on a color-to-pattern mapping and an arrangement grid derived from the input.

input_components:
  - component: Key Zone
    location: Top-left section of the input grid.
    description: Contains small (2x2) solid color squares separated by white space. Each color acts as a unique key.
    properties:
      - colors: Variable, depends on the example (e.g., [blue, green, red], [red, yellow], [azure, blue]).
      - size: Each key object is 2x2.
  - component: Value Zone
    location: Top-right section of the input grid.
    description: Contains larger (5x5) patterns, primarily using gray pixels, separated by white space. These are the value patterns.
    properties:
      - base_color: Gray (5).
      - background_color: White (0).
      - size: Each value pattern is 5x5.
      - count: The number of value patterns matches the number of distinct key colors.
      - mapping: Implicitly mapped to the key colors based on horizontal order (first key color maps to first value pattern, etc.).
  - component: Arrangement Zone
    location: Bottom-left section of the input grid.
    description: A grid pattern using the same colors found in the Key Zone. This defines the layout for the output grid.
    properties:
      - colors: Uses colors from the Key Zone.
      - background_color: White (0).
      - size: Variable height and width. Determines the macro-structure of the output.

output_components:
  - component: Tiled Grid
    description: A larger grid constructed by placing 5x5 blocks.
    properties:
      - block_size: 5x5.
      - structure: The arrangement of blocks follows the Arrangement Zone pattern from the input.
      - content: Each 5x5 block is a copy of a Value Zone pattern, but recolored.
      - recoloring_rule: For a block corresponding to a cell with color 'C' in the Arrangement Zone, the associated Value Zone pattern is retrieved, and all its non-white pixels are replaced with color 'C'. White pixels remain white.
      - dimensions: (height of Arrangement Zone * 5) rows x (width of Arrangement Zone * 5) columns.

relationships:
  - type: Mapping
    from: Key Zone colors
    to: Value Zone patterns (based on order).
  - type: Templating
    source: Arrangement Zone
    target: Output Grid structure.
  - type: Instantiation & Recoloring
    source_pattern: Value Zone pattern (selected via mapping).
    source_color: Arrangement Zone cell color.
    target: 5x5 block in the Output Grid.

constants:
  - background_color: White (0)
  - template_pattern_size: 5x5
  - key_pattern_size: 2x2 (though size isn't directly used, presence matters)
  - template_base_color: Gray (5) (in the input Value Zone)
