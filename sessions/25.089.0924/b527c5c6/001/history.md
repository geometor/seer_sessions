Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of pixels with colors represented by integers (0-9). The grids vary in size.
2.  **Colors Used:** The primary colors involved are white (0, background), green (3), and red (2).
3.  **Objects:** The grids contain rectangular blocks made primarily of green (3) pixels. Some of these green blocks contain exactly one red (2) pixel.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems triggered by the red pixels. For each red pixel, lines extend outwards horizontally and vertically from its position. These lines fill in the white background pixels.
5.  **Extension Color:** The color used to fill the extending lines depends on the pixel adjacent to the red pixel (in the direction of extension) in the *original* input grid.
    *   If the adjacent pixel (e.g., the one immediately to the left of the red pixel for the leftward extension) is green (3), the extension in that direction uses green (3).
    *   If the adjacent pixel is white (0) (meaning the red pixel is at the edge of the green shape in that direction), the extension in that direction uses red (2).
6.  **Extension Boundary:** The extension stops when it hits a non-white pixel or the edge of the grid. It only modifies pixels that were originally white (0).
7.  **Multiple Red Pixels:** If there are multiple red pixels, the extension process is applied independently for each one. The modifications accumulate on the output grid.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Task: Extend lines from red markers within green shapes.

Input Grid:
  - Contains a background color: white (0).
  - Contains objects: Primarily rectangular shapes made of green (3) pixels.
  - Contains markers: Some green shapes contain a single red (2) pixel.

Output Grid:
  - Is a modified version of the input grid.
  - Modifications involve drawing lines (extensions).

Transformation:
  - Trigger: Presence of red (2) pixels.
  - Process: For each red pixel at position (row, col):
      - Action: Extend lines horizontally (left/right) and vertically (up/down) from (row, col).
      - Target Pixels: Only modify pixels that are white (0) in the input grid.
      - Extension Color Rule:
          - Check the neighbor of the red pixel in the input grid in the direction of extension (e.g., neighbor (row, col-1) for left extension).
          - If the neighbor is green (3): Fill extending line with green (3).
          - If the neighbor is white (0) or off-grid: Fill extending line with red (2).
      - Termination Condition: Extension stops upon encountering a non-white pixel (in the input grid) or the grid boundary.
  - Overlap: Modifications from multiple red pixels are combined. The process modifies a copy of the input grid, so extensions don't block each other prematurely.

Relationships:
  - The red (2) pixel acts as a starting point for the transformation.
  - The color of the pixels immediately adjacent to the red pixel (in the original grid) dictates the color of the extensions.
  - The extensions interact only with the white (0) background pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (row `r`, column `c`) of the input grid to find all red (2) pixels.
3.  For each red pixel found at `(r, c)`:
    *   **Check Left Neighbor:** Determine the color of the input grid cell at `(r, c-1)` (treat off-grid as white (0)).
        *   If the left neighbor color is green (3), set the `fill_color` for left extension to green (3).
        *   Otherwise (if neighbor is white (0) or off-grid), set `fill_color` to red (2).
        *   Extend left from `(r, c-1)`: Move column index `cc` from `c-1` down to `0`. For each `cc`, if the output grid cell `(r, cc)` is white (0), change it to `fill_color`. If `(r, cc)` is not white (0), stop extending left.
    *   **Check Right Neighbor:** Determine the color of the input grid cell at `(r, c+1)` (treat off-grid as white (0)).
        *   If the right neighbor color is green (3), set the `fill_color` for right extension to green (3).
        *   Otherwise, set `fill_color` to red (2).
        *   Extend right from `(r, c+1)`: Move column index `cc` from `c+1` up to the grid width limit. For each `cc`, if the output grid cell `(r, cc)` is white (0), change it to `fill_color`. If `(r, cc)` is not white (0), stop extending right.
    *   **Check Upper Neighbor:** Determine the color of the input grid cell at `(r-1, c)` (treat off-grid as white (0)).
        *   If the upper neighbor color is green (3), set the `fill_color` for upward extension to green (3).
        *   Otherwise, set `fill_color` to red (2).
        *   Extend up from `(r-1, c)`: Move row index `rr` from `r-1` down to `0`. For each `rr`, if the output grid cell `(rr, c)` is white (0), change it to `fill_color`. If `(rr, c)` is not white (0), stop extending up.
    *   **Check Lower Neighbor:** Determine the color of the input grid cell at `(r+1, c)` (treat off-grid as white (0)).
        *   If the lower neighbor color is green (3), set the `fill_color` for downward extension to green (3).
        *   Otherwise, set `fill_color` to red (2).
        *   Extend down from `(r+1, c)`: Move row index `rr` from `r+1` up to the grid height limit. For each `rr`, if the output grid cell `(rr, c)` is white (0), change it to `fill_color`. If `(rr, c)` is not white (0), stop extending down.
4.  After processing all red pixels from the input grid, return the final modified output grid.
