            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of pixels with colors represented by integers (0-9). The grids vary in size.\n2.  **Colors Used:** The primary colors involved are white (0, background), green (3), and red (2).\n3.  **Objects:** The grids contain rectangular blocks made primarily of green (3) pixels. Some of these green blocks contain exactly one red (2) pixel.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems triggered by the red pixels. For each red pixel, lines extend outwards horizontally and vertically from its position. These lines fill in the white background pixels.\n5.  **Extension Color:** The color used to fill the extending lines depends on the pixel adjacent to the red pixel (in the direction of extension) in the *original* input grid.\n    *   If the adjacent pixel (e.g., the one immediately to the left of the red pixel for the leftward extension) is green (3), the extension in that direction uses green (3).\n    *   If the adjacent pixel is white (0) (meaning the red pixel is at the edge of the green shape in that direction), the extension in that direction uses red (2).\n6.  **Extension Boundary:** The extension stops when it hits a non-white pixel or the edge of the grid. It only modifies pixels that were originally white (0).\n7.  **Multiple Red Pixels:** If there are multiple red pixels, the extension process is applied independently for each one. The modifications accumulate on the output grid.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

The process modifies a copy of the input grid, so extensions don't block each other prematurely.\n\nRelationships:\n  - The red (2) pixel acts as a starting point for the transformation.\n  - The color of the pixels immediately adjacent to the red pixel (in the original grid) dictates the color of the extensions.\n  - The extensions interact only with the white (0) background pixels.\n```"

For each red pixel found at `(r, c)`:\n    *   **Check Left Neighbor:** Determine the color of the input grid cell at `(r, c-1)` (treat off-grid as white (0)).\n        *   If the left neighbor color is green (3), set the `fill_color` for left extension to green (3).\n        *   Otherwise (if neighbor is white (0) or off-grid), set `fill_color` to red (2).\n        *   Extend left from `(r, c-1)`: Move column index `cc` from `c-1` down to `0`. For each `cc`, if the output grid cell `(r, cc)` is white (0), change it to `fill_color`. If `(r, cc)` is not white (0), stop extending left.\n    *   **Check Right Neighbor:** Determine the color of the input grid cell at `(r, c+1)` (treat off-grid as white (0)).\n        *   If the right neighbor color is green (3), set the `fill_color` for right extension to green (3).\n        *   Otherwise, set `fill_color` to red (2).\n        *   Extend right from `(r, c+1)`: Move column index `cc` from `c+1` up to the grid width limit. For each `cc`, if the output grid cell `(r, cc)` is white (0), change it to `fill_color`. If `(r, cc)` is not white (0), stop extending right.\n    *   **Check Upper Neighbor:** Determine the color of the input grid cell at `(r-1, c)` (treat off-grid as white (0)).\n        *   If the upper neighbor color is green (3), set the `fill_color` for upward extension to green (3).\n        *   Otherwise, set `fill_color` to red (2).\n        *   Extend up from `(r-1, c)`: Move row index `rr` from `r-1` down to `0`. For each `rr`, if the output grid cell `(rr, c)` is white (0), change it to `fill_color`. If `(rr, c)` is not white (0), stop extending up.\n    *   **Check Lower Neighbor:** Determine the color of the input grid cell at `(r+1, c)` (treat off-grid as white (0)).\n        *   If the lower neighbor color is green (3), set the `fill_color` for downward extension to green (3).\n        *   Otherwise, set `fill_color` to red (2).\n        *   Extend down from `(r+1, c)`: Move row index `rr` from `r+1` up to the grid height limit.
