Task: Extend lines from red markers within green shapes.

Input Grid:
  - Contains a background color: white (0).
  - Contains objects: Primarily rectangular shapes made of green (3) pixels.
  - Contains markers: Some green shapes contain a single red (2) pixel.

Output Grid:
  - Is a modified version of the input grid.
  - Modifications involve drawing lines (extensions).

Transformation:
  - Trigger: Presence of red (2) pixels.
  - Process: For each red pixel at position (row, col):
      - Action: Extend lines horizontally (left/right) and vertically (up/down) from (row, col).
      - Target Pixels: Only modify pixels that are white (0) in the input grid.
      - Extension Color Rule:
          - Check the neighbor of the red pixel in the input grid in the direction of extension (e.g., neighbor (row, col-1) for left extension).
          - If the neighbor is green (3): Fill extending line with green (3).
          - If the neighbor is white (0) or off-grid: Fill extending line with red (2).
      - Termination Condition: Extension stops upon encountering a non-white pixel (in the input grid) or the grid boundary.
  - Overlap: Modifications from multiple red pixels are combined. The process modifies a copy of the input grid, so extensions don't block each other prematurely.

Relationships:
  - The red (2) pixel acts as a starting point for the transformation.
  - The color of the pixels immediately adjacent to the red pixel (in the original grid) dictates the color of the extensions.
  - The extensions interact only with the white (0) background pixels.
