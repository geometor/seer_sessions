Determine the extension color for each of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) based on the color of the immediate neighbor in that direction in the *original* input grid:\n      - If the neighbor is green (3), the extension color is green (3).\n      - If the neighbor is white (0) or the red pixel is at the edge (neighbor is off-grid), the extension color is red (2).\n   b. Extend lines in each of the four directions starting from the neighbor position.\n   c. The extension only modifies pixels in the output grid if the corresponding pixel in the *original* input grid was white (0).\n   d. The extension in each direction continues until it hits a pixel that was *not* white (0) in the original input grid, or the grid boundary.\n3.
