    Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
    1. Identify all 'ShapePixels' which are pixels whose color is neither gray (8) nor magenta (6).
    2. Find all gray (8) pixels that are adjacent (including diagonals, 8-connectivity) to any ShapePixel.
    3. Only consider adjacent gray pixels that are located *above* the second magenta line (row index < height - 3).
    4. Change these identified adjacent gray pixels to green (3) in the output grid.
    5. Keep track if any of the pixels changed to green in step 4 are located within the top 5 rows (rows 0-4).
    6. If any changes occurred in the top 5 rows, change all pixels in the bottom two rows (rows height-2 and height-1) to green (3).
    7. Otherwise (if no changes occurred in the top 5 rows), change all pixels in the bottom two rows to red (2).
    8. All other pixels retain their original color unless modified by rule 4 or rules 6/7.
