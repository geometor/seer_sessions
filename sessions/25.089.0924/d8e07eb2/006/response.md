## General Assessment

The previous code timed out, indicating a potential efficiency issue in the implementation. The core logic involved iterating through grid pixels and checking neighbors, which might be too slow for the given constraints. The strategy is to:

1.  **Re-evaluate the Algorithm:** Consider optimizing the pixel iteration. Instead of checking neighbors for *every* gray pixel, it might be more efficient to iterate through the non-gray, non-magenta "shape" pixels and identify their adjacent gray neighbors. This was attempted in an earlier iteration (`code_01`) but led to `code_02` which timed out. Let's stick with the concept of iterating through shape pixels first but ensure the implementation is correct and optimized.
2.  **Verify Logic Across Examples:** Ensure the rules derived from the first example hold true for all examples. Specifically, confirm the adjacency rule (8-connectivity), the colors involved (gray -> green), the exclusion of magenta lines, the condition for the bottom rows' color (green if changes in rows 0-4, red otherwise), and the restriction of changes to pixels *above* the second magenta line (row 27).
3.  **Gather Metrics:** Systematically analyze each training pair to confirm patterns and rules using code execution.

## Metrics Gathering

We will analyze each training example to verify the observed patterns.
