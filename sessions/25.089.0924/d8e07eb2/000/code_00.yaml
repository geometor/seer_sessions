Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 30 rows x 22 columns (consistent across examples)
    - BackgroundColor: Gray (8)
Regions:
  - Name: TopSection
    Location: Rows 0-4
  - Name: Separator1
    Location: Row 5
    Color: Magenta (6)
  - Name: MiddleSection
    Location: Rows 6-26
  - Name: Separator2
    Location: Row 27
    Color: Magenta (6)
  - Name: BottomSection
    Location: Rows 28-29
Objects:
  - Name: Shape
    Properties:
      - Color: Any color except Gray (8) or Magenta (6)
      - Location: Primarily within TopSection and MiddleSection
      - Size: Typically small, often within 3x3 bounding box
      - Composition: Contiguous pixels of the same color
Actions:
  - Name: FindAdjacentGrays
    Input: Input Grid
    Output: Set of coordinates of Gray (8) pixels
    Rule: Identify all Gray (8) pixels that are adjacent (including diagonals, 8-connectivity) to any Shape pixel.
  - Name: ChangeAdjacentToGreen
    Input: Input Grid, Set of coordinates from FindAdjacentGrays
    Output: Modified Grid
    Rule: Change the color of the pixels at the identified coordinates to Green (3).
  - Name: CheckTopSectionChange
    Input: Input Grid, Modified Grid (from ChangeAdjacentToGreen)
    Output: Boolean flag (True if changes occurred in TopSection, False otherwise)
    Rule: Compare the TopSection (rows 0-4) of the Input Grid and the Modified Grid. Return True if any pixel changed color within this section, False otherwise.
  - Name: SetBottomColor
    Input: Modified Grid, Boolean flag (from CheckTopSectionChange)
    Output: Final Output Grid
    Rule:
      - If the boolean flag is True: Change all pixels in the BottomSection (rows 28-29) to Green (3).
      - If the boolean flag is False: Change all pixels in the BottomSection (rows 28-29) to Red (2).
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Used to find Gray pixels near Shapes (8-directional connectivity).
  - Containment: Shapes are contained within specific Regions (TopSection, MiddleSection). Changes are assessed based on Region (TopSection).
