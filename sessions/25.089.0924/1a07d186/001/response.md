Transformation Rule:
1. Identify "Lines": full horizontal rows or vertical columns of a single non-white color (0).
2. Identify "Single Pixels": non-white pixels that are not part of any identified Line.
3. For each Single Pixel:
    a. Clear its original position in the output grid (set to white/0).
    b. If there are no Lines of the same color as the Single Pixel, it is effectively removed.
    c. If there are Lines of the same color, find the Line that is orthogonally closest (minimum absolute difference in row index for horizontal lines, column index for vertical lines).
    d. Determine the target position: the cell immediately adjacent to this nearest Line, located on the same column (for horizontal lines) or same row (for vertical lines) as the original Single Pixel.
    e. Record the color and target position for placement.
4. After calculating all target positions, place the recorded colors at their target coordinates in the output grid. If multiple pixels target the same cell, the last one processed determines the final color.
5. Pixels that are part of Lines and background pixels remain unchanged (unless a Single Pixel moves into a background cell).
