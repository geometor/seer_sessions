Grid:
  - Size: Variable height and width (observed up to 18x19).
  - Background: Predominantly white (0).
Objects:
  - Type: Line
    - Definition: A complete horizontal row or a complete vertical column consisting of a single non-white color.
    - Properties:
      - color: The non-white color of the line (e.g., red, blue, green, yellow, azure).
      - orientation: horizontal or vertical.
      - index: The row number (for horizontal) or column number (for vertical).
    - Persistence: Lines remain unchanged between input and output.
  - Type: Single Pixel
    - Definition: An isolated non-white pixel that is not part of a Line object.
    - Properties:
      - color: The non-white color of the pixel.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
    - Transformation: These pixels either move or are removed.
Relationships & Actions:
  - Association: Each Single Pixel is potentially associated with Lines of the *same color*.
  - Proximity: The 'nearest' Line of the same color determines the action. Distance is measured orthogonally (row difference for horizontal lines, column difference for vertical lines).
  - Movement:
    - Trigger: A Single Pixel moves if there is at least one Line of the same color.
    - Direction: Towards the nearest Line of the same color (vertically for horizontal lines, horizontally for vertical lines).
    - Destination: The pixel lands in the cell immediately adjacent to the nearest Line, along the path of movement (row above/below for horizontal lines, column left/right for vertical lines).
  - Removal:
    - Trigger: A Single Pixel is removed (its location becomes white) if there are no Lines of its color in the grid.
  - Processing Order: Original single pixel locations are cleared (set to white) before the pixel is potentially placed in its new location.
