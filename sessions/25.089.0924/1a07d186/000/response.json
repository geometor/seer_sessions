            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain a background of white pixels (0). They feature one or more prominent \"lines\" - either a full horizontal row or a full vertical column filled with a single non-white color. Additionally, there are scattered single pixels of various non-white colors located elsewhere in the grid.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the original lines exactly as they were in the input. The background remains white. The scattered single pixels from the input have either moved to a new location or disappeared entirely.\n3.  **Key Transformation:** The transformation seems to operate only on the single, non-line pixels. Their fate (moving or disappearing) and destination (if moved) appears related to the lines present in the grid.\n4.  **Pixel Movement:** When a single pixel moves, it seems to move directly towards the nearest line *of the same color*. The movement is strictly vertical for horizontal lines and strictly horizontal for vertical lines. The pixel stops at the position immediately adjacent (one step away) to the line it moved towards.\n5.  **Pixel Removal:** Single pixels disappear if there is no line of the same color present anywhere in the grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

A Line is defined as a full horizontal row or a full vertical column composed entirely of a single non-white color. Record the color, orientation (horizontal/vertical), and index (row/column number) of each Line found.\n3.  Identify all \"Single Pixels\" in the input grid. These are non-white pixels that are *not* part of any identified Line. Record the color and position (row, column) of each Single Pixel.\n4.  For each identified Single Pixel P with color C at position (r, c):\n    a.  Check if any Lines with color C exist in the grid (identified in step 2).\n    b.  **If no Lines of color C exist:** Set the pixel at position (r, c) in the *output grid* to white (0).\n    c.  **If one or more Lines of color C exist:**\n        i.  Find the Line L_nearest among them that is closest to pixel P. Calculate distance as `abs(r - line_r)` for horizontal lines at `line_r`, and `abs(c - line_c)` for vertical lines at `line_c`. (If there's a tie for nearest, any of the tied lines can be chosen - the outcome will be the same based on the movement rule).\n        ii. Determine the target position (tr, tc) based on L_nearest:\n            *   If L_nearest is horizontal at `line_r`:\n                *   Set target column `tc = c`.\n                *   If the pixel P is above the line (`r < line_r`), set target row `tr = line_r - 1`.\n                *   If the pixel P is below the line (`r > line_r`), set target row `tr = line_r + 1`.\n            *   If L_nearest is vertical at `line_c`:\n                *   Set target row `tr = r`.\n                *   If the pixel P is to the left of the line (`c < line_c`), set target column `tc = line_c - 1`.\n                *   If the pixel P is to the right of the line (`c > line_c`), set target column `tc = line_c + 1`.\n        iii. Set the pixel at the original position (r, c) in the *output grid* to white (0).\n        iv. Set the pixel at the calculated target position (tr, tc) in the *output grid* to color C.\n5.  The final state of the output grid after processing all Single Pixels is the result."
