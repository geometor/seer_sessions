            "text": "*   **Assessment**:\n    The initial analysis correctly identified the grid structure, the concept of subgrids, and the presence of a unique source pattern. The core transformation idea of replicating the source pattern was also correct. However, the rule for *where* to replicate the pattern was inaccurately identified as \"all subgrids in the same row or column\". The failed examples show that the replication is more selective. The transformed outputs applied the pattern to the entire row and column of the source subgrid, while the expected outputs show a sparser, checkerboard-like replication.\n\n    The strategy for resolution is to re-examine the relationship between the source subgrid's coordinates (within the grid-of-subgrids) and the coordinates of the target subgrids where the pattern is replicated in the expected outputs. The key seems to be related to the parity (even/odd) of the subgrid indices.\n\n*   **Metrics**:\n    "
