*   **Assessment and Strategy**:
    *   The initial analysis correctly identified the grid structure (lines every 4th row/column, defining 3x3 subgrids) and the concept of locating a unique source pattern within one subgrid.
    *   The key error in the previous attempts, particularly the second one submitted for testing, was the incorrect implementation of the replication rule. The failed results clearly show that the pattern was not copied to all required locations. The expected outputs demonstrate a simple rule: replicate the source pattern to *all* subgrids that share the same row *or* the same column index as the source subgrid within the grid-of-subgrids structure.
    *   The second code attempt introduced a parity check (`r_idx % 2 == source_subgrid_row % 2` or `c_idx % 2 == source_subgrid_col % 2`) which is not supported by the examples.
    *   The strategy is to revert to the simpler, correct replication rule: if a subgrid's row index matches the source row index OR its column index matches the source column index, it should be filled with the source pattern. The logic for identifying the grid structure and the source pattern appears sound and should be retained.

*   **Metrics**:
