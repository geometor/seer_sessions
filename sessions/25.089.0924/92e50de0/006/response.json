            "text": "*   **General Assessment**:\n    The initial analysis correctly identified the grid structure, the concept of subgrids, and the presence of a unique source pattern. The core transformation logic involving replicating this pattern was also identified. However, the *rule* for replication was oversimplified. The provided code replicates the pattern to *all* subgrids sharing the source's row or column index. The test results clearly show this is incorrect. The actual replication pattern is more selective, appearing in a checkerboard or alternating fashion along the source row and column. The replication rule needs refinement to incorporate this observation, likely based on the parity (even/odd) of the subgrid indices.\n\n*   **Metrics**:\n    Let's verify the source subgrid indices and the replication pattern using the examples. We assume 3x3 subgrids and a spacing of 4 (subgrids start at row/col 0, 4, 8, ...). Subgrid indices `(r_idx, c_idx)` are 0-based.\n\n"
