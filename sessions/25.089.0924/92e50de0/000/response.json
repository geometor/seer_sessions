These lines appear regularly, creating smaller, identically sized cells or subgrids within the main grid.\n    *   In the input grids, these subgrids are mostly white (0), except for *one* subgrid which contains a unique pattern composed of a different color (yellow, green, or red).\n    *   The transformation involves identifying this unique pattern and its location (which subgrid it occupies).\n    *   In the output grid, this unique pattern is replicated into all other subgrids that fall on the same row or same column as the original pattern's subgrid within the larger grid structure.\n    *   The grid lines and the background white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
