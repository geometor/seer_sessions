Okay, the script confirms:
1.  The exact output grid does **not** exist as a subgrid within the input grid.
2.  The largest solid rectangle of orange (7) is at row 20, col 21, with height 6 and width 8. (`r=20, c=21, h=6, w=8`). My manual calculation was slightly off on the column (I thought it started at col 11). The code says `Input[20:26, 21:29]` is the largest solid orange rectangle. Let me recheck the input grid visually for orange (7).
    Rows 20-25:
    Col 11: 9 ... Col 20: 9
    Col 21: 7 ... Col 28: 7
    Col 29: 2
    Yes, the code is correct. The largest orange rectangle is `Input[20:26, 21:29]`. Its size is 6x8. The output grid size is 6x8.

This reinforces the hypothesis:
1.  Find the largest solid rectangle of orange (7).
2.  The dimensions (height, width) of this rectangle define the output grid dimensions.
3.  The *content* of the output grid comes from somewhere else in the input.

Where does the content come from?
The orange rectangle is at `(r=20, c=21)`. Size `(h=6, w=8)`.
The output grid is size `(h=6, w=8)`.

Let's re-examine `train_1`:
Input: 30x30, Output: 10x10
Let's find the largest orange (7) rectangle in `train_1`.
