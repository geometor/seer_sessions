            "text": "Okay, the script confirms:\n1.  The exact output grid does **not** exist as a subgrid within the input grid.\n2.  The largest solid rectangle of orange (7) is at row 20, col 21, with height 6 and width 8. (`r=20, c=21, h=6, w=8`). My manual calculation was slightly off on the column (I thought it started at col 11). The code says `Input[20:26, 21:29]` is the largest solid orange rectangle. Let me recheck the input grid visually for orange (7).\n    Rows 20-25:\n    Col 11: 9 ... Col 20: 9\n    Col 21: 7 ... Col 28: 7\n    Col 29: 2\n    Yes, the code is correct. The largest orange rectangle is `Input[20:26, 21:29]`. Its size is 6x8. The output grid size is 6x8.\n\nThis reinforces the hypothesis:\n1.  Find the largest solid rectangle of orange (7).\n2.  The dimensions (height, width) of this rectangle define the output grid dimensions.\n3.  The *content* of the output grid comes from somewhere else in the input.\n\nWhere does the content come from?\nThe orange rectangle is at `(r=20, c=21)`. Size `(h=6, w=8)`.\nThe output grid is size `(h=6, w=8)`.\n\nLet's re-examine `train_1`:\nInput: 30x30, Output: 10x10\nLet's find the largest orange (7) rectangle in `train_1`.\n"
