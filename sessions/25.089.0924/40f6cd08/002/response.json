            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the general concept: find a \"pattern\" source rectangle and copy its interior pattern into \"simple\" target rectangles whose solid color matches the pattern rectangle's frame color. However, the execution failed on all training examples, indicating issues with one or more of the following:\n\n1.  **Object Identification/Classification:** The criteria for distinguishing \"simple\" vs. \"pattern\" rectangles might be flawed or insufficient. The BFS and bounding box logic might incorrectly group pixels or misinterpret shapes that aren't perfect rectangles filled edge-to-edge within their bounding box (though the examples seem to be perfect rectangles). The check `len(coords_set) != obj_h * obj_w` might be too strict or incorrectly implemented if the BFS doesn't capture *all* pixels within the intended rectangle boundary cleanly.\n2.  **Pattern Extraction:** The way the `inner_pattern` is extracted (`grid[min_r+1:max_r, min_c+1:max_c]`) seems standard, but needs verification based on the identified pattern object's bounds.\n3.  **Target Identification:** Simple rectangles matching the frame color are targeted, but the code's output shows incorrect modifications, implying either the wrong simple rectangles are matched, or the subsequent pattern application is wrong.\n4.  **Pattern Application (Copying/Cropping):** The logic for placing the extracted pattern into the target's interior (`output_grid[target_top : target_top + copy_h, target_left : target_left + copy_w] = pattern_to_copy`) needs careful review, especially concerning coordinate calculations and cropping (`copy_h`, `copy_w`).\n\nThe strategy is to add detailed logging to the existing code to observe its internal state (identified objects, extracted patterns, target matches, copy parameters) for each example, compare this intermediate state to the expected behavior, and refine the logic accordingly.\n\n**Metrics and Detailed Analysis via Code Execution**\n\nLet's add logging to the `transform` function to understand its decisions.\n\n"
