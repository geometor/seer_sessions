It wasn't classified as 'simple' either, meaning it likely failed the `is_solid_rectangle` check or the subsequent `classify_object` logic for pattern rectangles.\n\nLet's look at the top-left object in Example 1 again:\nRows 5-8, Columns 3-12.\n"

            "text": "**General Assessment & Strategy Revision:**\n\nThe previous code failed because its definition and identification of objects were flawed. The initial BFS approach, connecting any non-zero neighbors, merged distinct parts of the pattern object and failed to recognize it. Subsequent attempts to refine object detection using same-color BFS or reconstructing from single-color blocks also failed to correctly identify the 'pattern' object in Example 1.\n\nThe core issue lies in defining what constitutes an \"object\" in this context. The key seems to be the structure: rectangles (solid blocks of non-zero pixels) which are either uniformly colored ('simple') or have a 1-pixel frame of one color and a differing interior ('pattern').\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify Potential Rectangles:** Find *all* rectangular blocks composed entirely of non-background (non-zero) pixels. A simple way is to iterate through all possible top-left (r1, c1) and bottom-right (r2, c2) corners and check if the enclosed grid slice `grid[r1:r2+1, c1:c2+1]` contains only non-zero values. Store these valid rectangular regions (bbox + content). Avoid duplicates (e.g., a smaller rectangle contained within a larger one might be found; need a method to prioritize or filter). A better approach might be flood fill (BFS) *only* on non-zero cells, find bounding boxes, and *then* verify if the component fills the bounding box without any background pixels inside.\n2.  **Classify Rectangles:** Iterate through the identified rectangular regions.\n    *   **Simple:** Check if all pixels within the rectangle have the same color.\n    *   **Pattern:** Check if it's at least 3x3, has a uniform 1-pixel border (frame) of one color, and contains at least one pixel of a *different* color in its interior.\n3.  **Apply Transformation:** Find the unique 'pattern' rectangle. Extract its frame color and inner pattern. Find all 'simple' rectangles whose color matches the pattern's frame color. Copy the (cropped) inner pattern into the inner area of these matching simple rectangles.\n\n**Metrics & Renewed Investigation (Example 1):**\n\nLet's manually verify the objects in Example 1 based on the revised strategy.\n\n*   **Object 1:** Bbox=(2, 3, 11, 13). Content includes multiple colors (2, 6, 8). Frame check: Top/Bottom rows are color 2. Left/Right columns are color 2. Interior (rows 3-10, cols 4-12) contains colors 6 and 8, different from frame color 2. Size is > 3x3. **Classification: Pattern. Frame=2.** Inner pattern is grid[3:11, 4:12].\n*   **Object 2:** Bbox=(8, 19, 16, 27). Content is all color 2. **Classification: Simple. Color=2.**\n*   **Object 3:** Bbox=(19, 5, 28, 20). Content is all color 2. **Classification: Simple. Color=2.**\n\nThe previous `tool_code` runs failed to identify Object 1 correctly. The BFS was too greedy, and the reconstruction logic was also flawed. The classification logic for 'pattern' rectangles needs to correctly identify the frame and check the interior based on the bounding box, not just connected components.\n\n**Revised YAML Facts:**\n\n"
