Analyzed Objects:
  - type: Background
    color: white (0)
  - type: Rectangle
    description: A rectangular region where all pixels are non-white (non-zero).
    identification: Scan grid for bounding boxes (r1, c1, r2, c2) such that all grid cells within these bounds are != 0.
    subtypes:
      - Simple Rectangle: All pixels within the rectangle have the same color.
        properties:
          - color: The single color value.
          - bbox: (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)
          - size: height, width
      - Pattern Rectangle:
        conditions:
          - Must be at least 3x3 pixels.
          - Must have a 1-pixel thick border (frame) consisting of a single, uniform color.
          - The interior region (inside the frame) must contain at least one pixel whose color is different from the frame color.
        properties:
          - frame_color: The color of the 1-pixel border.
          - inner_pattern: A 2D grid representing the pixels inside the frame.
          - bbox: (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)
          - size: height, width
        uniqueness: Assume only one Pattern Rectangle exists per input grid.

Relationships & Actions:
  - Identification: Find all Simple and Pattern Rectangles based on the definitions above.
  - Matching: Compare the 'color' of each Simple Rectangle to the 'frame_color' of the unique Pattern Rectangle.
  - Transformation: Pattern Propagation.
    - Condition: A Simple Rectangle's 'color' matches the Pattern Rectangle's 'frame_color', AND the Simple Rectangle is large enough to have an interior (>= 3x3).
    - Action:
      1. Copy the 'inner_pattern' from the Pattern Rectangle.
      2. Determine the inner area of the target Simple Rectangle (bbox excluding the 1-pixel border).
      3. Calculate the dimensions to copy (cropping the source pattern if the target inner area is smaller).
      4. Paste the (potentially cropped) pattern into the target Simple Rectangle's inner area on the output grid, starting at the top-left corner of the inner area.
  - No Change:
    - The original Pattern Rectangle remains unchanged.
    - Simple Rectangles that do not match the frame color remain unchanged.
    - Simple Rectangles that match but are too small (< 3x3) remain unchanged.
    - The background remains unchanged.
