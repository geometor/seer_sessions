            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe input grids contain several rectangular objects against a white background. Some rectangles are filled with a single solid color, while others contain intricate patterns made of multiple colors, often resembling nested frames or layers. The output grids show modifications primarily to the single-colored rectangles. Specifically, single-colored rectangles whose color matches the *outermost* color (the frame) of a patterned rectangle inherit the internal pattern of that patterned rectangle. The pattern seems to be copied directly from the source pattern object's interior and placed into the target rectangle's interior, potentially being cropped if the target interior is smaller. Rectangles whose color does not match the frame of any patterned rectangle remain unchanged. The original patterned rectangles also remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

The comparison is between the solid color of the Simple Rectangle and the frame_color of the Pattern Rectangle.\n  - Transformation: Pattern Propagation.\n    - Condition: If a Simple Rectangle's color matches the Pattern Rectangle's frame_color.\n    - Action: The inner_pattern of the Pattern Rectangle is copied into the inner area of the Simple Rectangle.\n    - Pattern Handling: The source inner_pattern is placed starting at the top-left corner of the target's inner area. If the target inner area is smaller than the source inner_pattern, the pattern is cropped. If larger, it seems only the top-left portion matching the source pattern's size is filled, but the examples only show cropping or exact fits for the inner areas *horizontally*, with vertical cropping/copying. Let's assume it's a direct copy/crop mechanism based on the examples. The frame of the target Simple Rectangle retains its original color.\n  - No Change:\n    - Simple Rectangles whose color does not match the Pattern Rectangle's frame_color remain unchanged.\n    - The original Pattern Rectangle remains unchanged.\n    - The background remains unchanged.\n```"

Store its frame color and its inner pattern (the grid content inside the frame).\n4.  Find all \"Simple Rectangle\" objects, characterized by being filled with a single solid color.\n5.  For each \"Simple Rectangle\":\n    a.  Get its solid color and the coordinates of its inner area (excluding the 1-pixel frame).\n    b.  Compare its solid color to the frame color of the \"Pattern Rectangle\".\n    c.  If the colors match:\n        i.
