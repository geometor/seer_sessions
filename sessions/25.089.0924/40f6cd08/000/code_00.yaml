Analyzed Objects:
  - type: Background
    color: white (0)
    description: The constant background color for the grid.
  - type: Simple Rectangle
    description: A rectangular object composed of a single solid color.
    properties:
      - color: The single color filling the rectangle.
      - size: Height and width.
      - location: Bounding box coordinates.
  - type: Pattern Rectangle
    description: >
      A rectangular object with an outermost frame of one color
      and an inner area containing a pattern of one or more different colors.
      Appears to be unique in each input grid.
    properties:
      - frame_color: The color of the 1-pixel thick outermost border.
      - inner_pattern: The 2D grid of colors within the frame.
      - size: Height and width of the entire object.
      - location: Bounding box coordinates.

Relationships & Actions:
  - Identification: The process must distinguish between the background, Simple Rectangles, and the unique Pattern Rectangle.
  - Matching: Simple Rectangles are compared to the Pattern Rectangle based on color. The comparison is between the solid color of the Simple Rectangle and the frame_color of the Pattern Rectangle.
  - Transformation: Pattern Propagation.
    - Condition: If a Simple Rectangle's color matches the Pattern Rectangle's frame_color.
    - Action: The inner_pattern of the Pattern Rectangle is copied into the inner area of the Simple Rectangle.
    - Pattern Handling: The source inner_pattern is placed starting at the top-left corner of the target's inner area. If the target inner area is smaller than the source inner_pattern, the pattern is cropped. If larger, it seems only the top-left portion matching the source pattern's size is filled, but the examples only show cropping or exact fits for the inner areas *horizontally*, with vertical cropping/copying. Let's assume it's a direct copy/crop mechanism based on the examples. The frame of the target Simple Rectangle retains its original color.
  - No Change:
    - Simple Rectangles whose color does not match the Pattern Rectangle's frame_color remain unchanged.
    - The original Pattern Rectangle remains unchanged.
    - The background remains unchanged.
