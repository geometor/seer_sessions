            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core concept: copying an inner pattern from a \"source\" (Pattern Rectangle) to \"target\" (Simple Rectangles) objects based on color matching between the target's solid color and the source's frame color. However, the provided code fails on all training examples, indicating a flaw in the implementation of this concept.\n\nThe failures consistently show significant pixel differences, suggesting issues beyond minor edge cases. Potential problems include:\n\n1.  **Object Identification/Classification:** The functions `bfs_find_connected`, `is_solid_rectangle`, or `classify_rectangle` might be incorrectly identifying or categorizing the objects. For instance, the definition of a \"Pattern Rectangle\" (requiring an interior *different* from the frame) or \"Simple Rectangle\" might be too strict or buggy.\n2.  **Pattern Extraction:** The `inner_pattern` might not be extracted correctly from the identified Pattern Rectangle.\n3.  **Pattern Pasting:** The `paste_pattern` function might miscalculate coordinates, dimensions, or handle cropping incorrectly.\n4.  **Single Pattern Assumption:** While the description assumes only one Pattern Rectangle, the code finds the *first* one. If multiple exist (even if not intended by the task design), this could lead to using the wrong pattern.\n5.  **BFS/Visited Logic:** Errors in managing visited pixels could lead to objects being missed or partially processed.\n\nThe strategy is to re-examine the object identification and classification criteria, verify the pattern extraction and pasting logic step-by-step against the examples, and refine the Natural Language Program and Facts accordingly.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n"
