Transformation Rule Description:

1. Identify all distinct rectangular objects in the input grid against the white (0) background. An object is a connected component of non-background pixels. A rectangular object is one where the connected component perfectly fills its bounding box.
2. Distinguish between two types of rectangular objects:
   - "Simple Rectangles": Filled entirely with a single solid color.
   - "Pattern Rectangle": Has an outer frame (1-pixel thick border) of one color and an interior area containing different colors or patterns. Assume there is at most one such Pattern Rectangle per input grid.
3. If a Pattern Rectangle exists:
   a. Extract its frame color and its inner pattern (the grid content inside the frame).
   b. Iterate through all identified Simple Rectangles.
   c. If a Simple Rectangle's solid color matches the Pattern Rectangle's frame color, and the Simple Rectangle is large enough to have an interior (at least 3x3):
      i. Copy the inner pattern from the Pattern Rectangle.
      ii. Place this pattern into the interior area of the Simple Rectangle (the area inside its 1-pixel border).
      iii. If the Simple Rectangle's interior is smaller than the pattern, crop the pattern (copy only the top-left portion that fits).
      iv. If the Simple Rectangle's interior is larger, only the top-left portion corresponding to the pattern's size is filled (as suggested by cropping behavior in examples).
4. Rectangles (Simple or Patterned) that do not meet the matching criteria, as well as the original Pattern Rectangle itself, remain unchanged in the output.
5. The background remains unchanged.
6. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
