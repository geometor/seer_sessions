task_elements:
  - Input Grid:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - properties:
          - contains a white (0) background
          - contains exactly one red (2) pixel (the seed pixel)
          - contains one or more objects made of blue (1) or green (3) pixels (barrier objects)
  - Output Grid:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - properties:
          - same dimensions as the input grid
          - preserves all non-white pixels from the input grid
          - contains additional red (2) pixels replacing some white (0) pixels from the input
objects:
  - name: Seed Pixel
    color: Red (2)
    quantity: 1 per input grid
    role: Starting point for the fill operation
  - name: Barrier Objects
    color: Blue (1) or Green (3)
    quantity: Variable (one or more) per input grid
    role: Boundaries that limit the fill operation
  - name: Background Pixel
    color: White (0)
    role: Can be filled with red if reachable from the seed pixel without crossing barriers
relationships:
  - The fill operation starts at the Seed Pixel.
  - The fill spreads only into adjacent (up, down, left, right) Background Pixels.
  - Barrier Objects and the grid boundaries block the spread of the fill.
actions:
  - Identify the location of the single red (2) Seed Pixel.
  - Identify the locations of all Barrier Objects (pixels with color 1 or 3).
  - Perform a flood fill operation:
      - Start at the Seed Pixel's location.
      - Use the color red (2) for filling.
      - Only fill white (0) pixels.
      - Do not fill beyond the grid boundaries or into Barrier Object pixels.
  - Combine the results: The output grid contains the original Barrier Objects, the original Seed Pixel, and the newly filled red (2) pixels.
