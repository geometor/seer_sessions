These blue and green objects often appear as horizontal or vertical lines or individual pixels.\n2.  **Output Grid Composition**: The output grid retains all the original pixels from the input grid in their exact locations. Additionally, some white (0) pixels from the input grid are changed to red (2) in the output grid.\n3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation is the addition of red (2) pixels. These new red pixels appear to originate from the single initial red pixel present in the input.\n4.  **Fill Behavior**: The added red pixels behave like a \"flood fill\" or \"paint bucket\" tool starting from the initial red pixel.\n5.  **Boundaries**: The flood fill spreads through adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (0) pixels. It stops when it encounters any non-white pixel (the original red pixel, or any blue or green pixel) or the grid boundaries.\n6.  **Object Preservation**: The original blue and green objects act as barriers to the red fill and remain unchanged in the output.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
