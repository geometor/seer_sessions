Multiple distinct objects can exist in a single input grid.\n3.  **Key Feature:** A recurring characteristic of interest seems to be objects exhibiting vertical symmetry. Not all objects in the input are symmetric, but the ones that seem relevant to the output possess this property.\n4.  **Symmetry Axis Color:** For vertically symmetric objects, the color of the pixels along the central vertical axis of symmetry appears crucial.\n5.  **Output Grids:** The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. They consist solely of azure (8) and white (0) pixels, forming distinct patterns or glyphs.\n6.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve:\n    *   Identifying specific types of objects in the input (vertically symmetric ones).\n    *   Extracting a key feature from these objects (the color of their central axis).\n    *   Mapping the unique set of these key feature colors found in the input to predefined output glyphs (patterns of azure pixels).\n    *   Combining these glyphs according to a rule if multiple unique feature colors are present.\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"
