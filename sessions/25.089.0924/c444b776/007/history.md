Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Separator Identification:** Both examples feature a prominent, continuous line of yellow pixels (color 4). In `train_1`, this line is horizontal, located at row 9. In `train_2`, it's vertical, located at column 9. This yellow line acts as a separator, dividing the grid.
2.  **Region Definition:** The yellow line divides the grid into two main regions (excluding the line itself).
3.  **Content Asymmetry:** In the input grids, one region contains a pattern of various colored pixels against a white background, while the other region is entirely white (color 0).
4.  **Transformation - Copy/Reflection:** The transformation involves copying the contents of the patterned region into the white region. This effectively creates a reflection of the pattern across the yellow separator line.
5.  **Preservation:** The yellow separator line itself and the original patterned region remain unchanged in the output grid.
6.  **Orientation:** The orientation of the copy/reflection depends on the orientation of the yellow line (horizontal line leads to vertical reflection, vertical line leads to horizontal reflection).

**Facts**


```yaml
- task: Find and reflect a pattern across a yellow separator line.
- objects:
    - grid: The input 2D array of pixels.
    - separator_line: A continuous line (horizontal or vertical) of yellow pixels (color 4).
    - pattern_region: The area on one side of the separator_line containing non-white pixels.
    - empty_region: The area on the other side of the separator_line, initially containing only white pixels (color 0).
- properties:
    - separator_line:
        - color: yellow (4)
        - orientation: horizontal or vertical
        - location: specific row index (if horizontal) or column index (if vertical)
    - pattern_region: Contains the source pattern.
    - empty_region: Initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
- relationships:
    - separator_line: Divides the grid into pattern_region and empty_region.
    - pattern_region: Source for the transformation.
    - empty_region: Target area for the transformation.
- actions:
    - Locate the separator_line.
    - Determine its orientation and location.
    - Identify the pattern_region and the empty_region based on the separator_line.
    - Copy the pixel values from the pattern_region into the corresponding positions within the empty_region, mirroring across the separator_line.
    - Preserve the original pattern_region and the separator_line in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Scan the input grid to find a continuous, single-pixel-thick line composed entirely of yellow pixels (color 4). This line will be either horizontal or vertical.
2.  Determine the orientation (horizontal or vertical) and the index (row or column) of this yellow separator line.
3.  Identify the two regions created by this line. One region will contain various colored pixels (the "pattern region"), and the other will be filled with white pixels (the "empty region").
4.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
5.  If the separator line is horizontal at row `R`:
    *   Determine if the pattern region is above (rows 0 to `R-1`) or below (rows `R+1` to end) the line.
    *   If the pattern is above, copy the pixels from rows 0 to `R-1` into rows `R+1` to `2*R`.
    *   If the pattern is below, copy the pixels from rows `R+1` to end into rows 0 to `R-1`. *(Self-correction: The examples only show patterns above/left and empty below/right. Assume the copy always happens from the non-empty side to the empty side relative to the line)*.
    *   For each row `r` in the pattern region, and each column `c`, copy the pixel value `input[r][c]` to the corresponding mirrored position `output[R + (R - r)][c]` (if pattern above) or `output[R - (r - R)][c]` (if pattern below) - Simplified: copy `input[r][c]` to `output[2*R - r][c]`.
6.  If the separator line is vertical at column `C`:
    *   Determine if the pattern region is to the left (columns 0 to `C-1`) or right (columns `C+1` to end) of the line.
    *   Assume the pattern is on the left and the empty region is on the right based on the example.
    *   For each row `r` and each column `c` in the pattern region (columns 0 to `C-1`), copy the pixel value `input[r][c]` to the corresponding mirrored position `output[r][C + (C - c)]` - Simplified: copy `input[r][c]` to `output[r][2*C - c]`.
7.  Ensure the yellow separator line and the original pattern region remain unchanged in the output grid. The output grid now contains the original pattern, the separator line, and the reflected pattern in the previously empty region.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Identify a continuous, single-pixel-thick line of yellow pixels (color 4) 
acting as a separator, which can be either horizontal or vertical. 
Determine the orientation and location (row or column index) of this line. 
The grid is divided into two regions by this line. One region contains a 
pattern (non-white pixels), and the other is initially empty (white pixels). 
Copy the pattern from its region into the empty region, reflecting it across 
the separator line. The original pattern and the separator line remain unchanged.
If the line is horizontal at row R, pixels from row r are copied to row 2*R - r.
If the line is vertical at column C, pixels from column c are copied to column 2*C - c.
The examples suggest the pattern is always above a horizontal line or to the 
left of a vertical line, and the reflection fills the area below or to the right, respectively.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code attempted to identify the separator line based on adjacency to an all-white region. The execution results show significant errors ("Pixels Off: 12" for Ex1, "Pixels Off: 30" for Ex2), and the displayed `Transformed Output` for both examples does not match the intended reflection logic, suggesting either a fundamental misunderstanding of the transformation, a bug in the implementation, or an issue with the testing/reporting itself.

Comparing the expected outputs with the inputs confirms the core idea: a reflection occurs across a yellow line. The pattern exists on one side, and the other side (which is initially all white in the examples) gets filled with the reflection.

The discrepancy likely arises from correctly identifying *which* line is the separator and *which* side contains the pattern to be reflected. The rule "adjacent to all-white" might be too specific. A more robust rule, explored in an earlier thought process but not the final submitted code, is to identify the separator line by checking which line has *non-background* (i.e., not white or yellow) pixels exclusively on one side.

**Strategy:**

1.  Re-implement the separator identification logic based on the exclusive presence of *foreground* colors (non-white, non-yellow) on one side of the yellow line.
2.  Verify the reflection coordinates calculation (`2*R - r_src`, `2*C - c_src`). This seems standard and likely correct.
3.  Ensure the reflection loop correctly iterates over the source region and writes to the target region in the `output_grid`.
4.  Use `code_execution` to verify grid dimensions and the separator location identified by the new logic for each example.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **train_1:**
    *   Shape: 19x9
    *   Horizontal Lines: Row 9.
    *   Vertical Lines: None.
    *   Separator: Identified correctly as `('horizontal', 9, 'above')` because foreground pixels exist above row 9 (`grid[:9, :]`) but not below row 9 (`grid[10:, :]`).
*   **train_2:**
    *   Shape: 19x19
    *   Horizontal Lines: Row 9.
    *   Vertical Lines: Column 9.
    *   Separator: Identified as `('horizontal', 9, 'below')`. Let's re-check the `has_foreground` logic manually for `train_2`:
        *   Horizontal check (`r=9`): `region_above = grid[:9, :]`. Contains only 0s and the vertical yellow line at col 9. `has_foreground(region_above, {0, 4})` -> `False`. `region_below = grid[10:, :]`. Contains colors 7, 2, 3, 8. `has_foreground(region_below, {0, 4})` -> `True`. Logic: `if not pattern_above and pattern_below: separator_info = ('horizontal', 9, 'below')`. **This matches the code output.**
        *   Vertical check (`c=9`): `region_left = grid[:, :9]`. Contains colors 7, 2, 3, 8. `has_foreground(region_left, {0, 4})` -> `True`. `region_right = grid[:, 10:]`. Contains only 0s. `has_foreground(region_right, {0, 4})` -> `False`. Logic: `if pattern_left and not pattern_right: separator_info = ('vertical', 9, 'left')`.
    *   **Issue:** The code stopped after finding the horizontal separator. The intended output for `train_2` clearly shows a *vertical* reflection. Why did the horizontal check succeed? Because the region *above* the horizontal yellow line (`grid[:9, :]`) technically only contains white (0) and yellow (4), thus `has_foreground` returns `False`. The region *below* (`grid[10:, :]`) *does* contain foreground colors (2, 3, 7, 8). Therefore, the condition `not pattern_above and pattern_below` was met for the horizontal line at `r=9`.
    *   **Refined Rule:** The separator isn't just *any* yellow line with foreground pixels on one side. It seems to be the line that separates the bulk of the foreground pattern from a mostly empty region. In `train_2`, both the horizontal line at `r=9` and the vertical line at `c=9` satisfy the *exclusive foreground* rule. However, the expected output implies the *vertical* line is the correct axis of reflection. How to distinguish?
        *   Perhaps the empty region must be *entirely* white (0)? Let's re-test the `_is_region_all_white` logic from the failed code:
            *   Ex1: `r=9`. `_is_region_all_white(..., 'below')` is True. `_is_region_all_white(..., 'above')` is False. -> `('horizontal', 9, 'above')`. Correct.
            *   Ex2: `r=9`. `_is_region_all_white(..., 'below')` is False. `_is_region_all_white(..., 'above')` is False. -> No horizontal separator.
            *   Ex2: `c=9`. `_is_region_all_white(..., 'right')` is True. `_is_region_all_white(..., 'left')` is False. -> `('vertical', 9, 'left')`. Correct.
        *   **Conclusion:** The logic from the failed code (`_is_region_all_white`) actually identified the correct separators for *both* examples. The failure wasn't in identification, but potentially in the reflection execution or reporting, as suspected earlier. Let's stick with the `_is_region_all_white` identification logic.

*(Self-correction: The discrepancy between the expected output and the provided "Transformed Output" for Ex1 in the prompt seems significant. The reflection appears vertically flipped in the provided output compared to the expected. Let's re-examine the calculation `r_tgt = 2 * R - r_src`. For Ex1, R=9. `r_src=1` (row with 5, 2) -> `r_tgt=18-1=17`. `r_src=7` (row with 2, 5, 5) -> `r_tgt=18-7=11`. This matches the *expected* output. The provided `Transformed Output` showed these patterns at rows 17 and 11 respectively, but other rows seemed misaligned. It's highly likely the provided `Transformed Output` display was erroneous, and the core logic was correct but failed some test condition, or the implementation had a subtle bug.)*

Let's proceed assuming the `_is_region_all_white` logic is the correct way to identify the separator and pattern side, and the reflection calculation is `target_coord = 2 * separator_coord - source_coord`.

**Updated Facts**


```yaml
- task: Reflect a pattern across a yellow separator line.
- objects:
    - grid: The input 2D array of pixels.
    - separator_line: A continuous line (horizontal or vertical) of yellow pixels (color 4). It is uniquely identified by being adjacent to a region containing only white pixels (color 0).
    - pattern_region: The area on the side of the separator_line *not* entirely composed of white pixels. This region contains the source pattern.
    - target_region: The area on the side of the separator_line composed entirely of white pixels (color 0). This region will be overwritten by the reflection.
- properties:
    - separator_line:
        - color: yellow (4)
        - orientation: horizontal or vertical
        - location: row index (R) or column index (C)
    - pattern_region: Contains the source pattern including any white/yellow pixels within it.
    - target_region: Initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
- relationships:
    - separator_line: Divides the grid into pattern_region and target_region.
    - pattern_region: Source for the reflection.
    - target_region: Destination for the reflection.
- actions:
    - Locate potential horizontal and vertical yellow lines.
    - For each potential line, check the regions on either side.
    - Identify the unique line where one adjacent region is *entirely* white (0) and the other is not.
    - Determine the orientation (horizontal/vertical), index (R/C), and the side containing the pattern ('above'/'below' or 'left'/'right').
    - Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    - Iterate through the pixels `(r_src, c_src)` in the pattern_region.
    - For each source pixel, calculate the target pixel coordinates using reflection logic:
        - If horizontal separator at R, pattern above: `r_tgt = 2*R - r_src`, `c_tgt = c_src`.
        - If horizontal separator at R, pattern below: `r_tgt = 2*R - r_src`, `c_tgt = c_src`.
        - If vertical separator at C, pattern left: `r_tgt = r_src`, `c_tgt = 2*C - c_src`.
        - If vertical separator at C, pattern right: `r_tgt = r_src`, `c_tgt = 2*C - c_src`.
    - Copy the value from `grid[r_src, c_src]` to `output_grid[r_tgt, c_tgt]`, ensuring target coordinates are within grid bounds.
    - Return the modified output_grid.

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find all complete horizontal lines and vertical lines composed entirely of yellow pixels (color 4).
3.  Iterate through the found horizontal yellow lines. For each line at row `R`:
    *   Check if the region strictly below the line (`rows R+1` to end) consists *only* of white pixels (color 0).
    *   Check if the region strictly above the line (`rows 0` to `R-1`) consists *only* of white pixels (color 0).
    *   If exactly one of these regions is all white, then this horizontal line is the separator. Record its index `R`, orientation ('horizontal'), and identify the pattern side ('above' if the below-region is white, 'below' if the above-region is white). Stop searching.
4.  If no horizontal separator was found, iterate through the found vertical yellow lines. For each line at column `C`:
    *   Check if the region strictly to the right of the line (`columns C+1` to end) consists *only* of white pixels (color 0).
    *   Check if the region strictly to the left of the line (`columns 0` to `C-1`) consists *only* of white pixels (color 0).
    *   If exactly one of these regions is all white, then this vertical line is the separator. Record its index `C`, orientation ('vertical'), and identify the pattern side ('left' if the right-region is white, 'right' if the left-region is white). Stop searching.
5.  If a horizontal separator was identified at row `R` with the pattern `above`:
    *   Iterate through each source row `r_src` from 0 to `R-1`.
    *   For each source column `c_src` from 0 to `cols-1`:
    *   Calculate the target row `r_tgt = R + (R - r_src) = 2*R - r_src`.
    *   If `r_tgt` is a valid row index, copy the pixel value from `input_grid[r_src][c_src]` to `output_grid[r_tgt][c_src]`.
6.  If a horizontal separator was identified at row `R` with the pattern `below`:
    *   Iterate through each source row `r_src` from `R+1` to `rows-1`.
    *   For each source column `c_src` from 0 to `cols-1`:
    *   Calculate the target row `r_tgt = R - (r_src - R) = 2*R - r_src`.
    *   If `r_tgt` is a valid row index, copy the pixel value from `input_grid[r_src][c_src]` to `output_grid[r_tgt][c_src]`.
7.  If a vertical separator was identified at column `C` with the pattern `left`:
    *   Iterate through each source row `r_src` from 0 to `rows-1`.
    *   For each source column `c_src` from 0 to `C-1`:
    *   Calculate the target column `c_tgt = C + (C - c_src) = 2*C - c_src`.
    *   If `c_tgt` is a valid column index, copy the pixel value from `input_grid[r_src][c_src]` to `output_grid[r_src][c_tgt]`.
8.  If a vertical separator was identified at column `C` with the pattern `right`:
    *   Iterate through each source row `r_src` from 0 to `rows-1`.
    *   For each source column `c_src` from `C+1` to `cols-1`:
    *   Calculate the target column `c_tgt = C - (c_src - C) = 2*C - c_src`.
    *   If `c_tgt` is a valid column index, copy the pixel value from `input_grid[r_src][c_src]` to `output_grid[r_src][c_tgt]`.
9.  Return the final output grid.
