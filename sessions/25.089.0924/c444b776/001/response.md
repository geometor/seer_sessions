"""
Identify a continuous, single-pixel-thick line of yellow pixels (color 4) 
acting as a separator, which can be either horizontal or vertical. 
Determine the orientation and location (row or column index) of this line. 
The grid is divided into two regions by this line. One region contains a 
pattern (non-white pixels), and the other is initially empty (white pixels). 
Copy the pattern from its region into the empty region, reflecting it across 
the separator line. The original pattern and the separator line remain unchanged.
If the line is horizontal at row R, pixels from row r are copied to row 2*R - r.
If the line is vertical at column C, pixels from column c are copied to column 2*C - c.
The examples suggest the pattern is always above a horizontal line or to the 
left of a vertical line, and the reflection fills the area below or to the right, respectively.
