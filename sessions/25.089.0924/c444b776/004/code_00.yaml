- task: Reflect a grid region across a unique yellow line separator.
- objects:
    - grid: The input/output 2D array of pixels.
    - separator_line: A continuous, single-pixel-thick line (horizontal or vertical) of yellow pixels (color 4). It must be adjacent to an 'empty_region'.
    - pattern_region: The area on one side of the separator_line, containing the content to be reflected. It may contain any colors, including background and other yellow lines.
    - empty_region: The area on the other side of the separator_line, containing *only* white pixels (color 0). This region will be overwritten by the reflection.
- properties:
    - separator_line:
        - color: yellow (4)
        - orientation: horizontal or vertical
        - location: row index (if horizontal) or column index (if vertical)
        - uniqueness: Only one line in the grid borders a region composed entirely of white pixels (0).
    - pattern_region: Source for the reflection.
    - empty_region: Destination for the reflection; initially contains only white (0).
    - background_color: white (0)
- relationships:
    - separator_line: Divides the grid into pattern_region and empty_region.
    - pattern_region: Adjacent to separator_line. Contains non-white pixels, or is simply the region not identified as the empty_region.
    - empty_region: Adjacent to separator_line. Contains exclusively white pixels.
- actions:
    - Identify potential horizontal and vertical yellow lines.
    - For each potential line, check its two adjacent regions.
    - Select the unique line where one adjacent region consists *entirely* of white (0) pixels. This is the separator_line.
    - Identify the other adjacent region as the pattern_region.
    - Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    - Iterate through the pixels (r, c) of the pattern_region.
    - Calculate the mirrored coordinates (target_r, target_c) in the empty_region based on the separator_line's orientation and index.
    - Copy the pixel value from `input[r][c]` to `output[target_r][target_c]`.
    - Preserve the original pattern_region and the separator_line in the output.
