            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code attempted to identify the separator line based on adjacency to an all-white region. The execution results show significant errors (\"Pixels Off: 12\" for Ex1, \"Pixels Off: 30\" for Ex2), and the displayed `Transformed Output` for both examples does not match the intended reflection logic, suggesting either a fundamental misunderstanding of the transformation, a bug in the implementation, or an issue with the testing/reporting itself.\n\nComparing the expected outputs with the inputs confirms the core idea: a reflection occurs across a yellow line. The pattern exists on one side, and the other side (which is initially all white in the examples) gets filled with the reflection.\n\nThe discrepancy likely arises from correctly identifying *which* line is the separator and *which* side contains the pattern to be reflected. The rule \"adjacent to all-white\" might be too specific. A more robust rule, explored in an earlier thought process but not the final submitted code, is to identify the separator line by checking which line has *non-background* (i.e., not white or yellow) pixels exclusively on one side.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Re-implement the separator identification logic based on the exclusive presence of *foreground* colors (non-white, non-yellow) on one side of the yellow line.\n2.  Verify the reflection coordinates calculation (`2*R - r_src`, `2*C - c_src`). This seems standard and likely correct.\n3.  Ensure the reflection loop correctly iterates over the source region and writes to the target region in the `output_grid`.\n4.  Use `code_execution` to verify grid dimensions and the separator location identified by the new logic for each example.\n\n**Metrics and Verification**\n"

Let's re-check the `has_foreground` logic manually for `train_2`:\n        *   Horizontal check (`r=9`): `region_above = grid[:9, :]`. Contains only 0s and the vertical yellow line at col 9. `has_foreground(region_above, {0, 4})` -> `False`. `region_below = grid[10:, :]`. Contains colors 7, 2, 3, 8. `has_foreground(region_below, {0, 4})` -> `True`. Logic: `if not pattern_above and pattern_below: separator_info = ('horizontal', 9, 'below')`. **This matches the code output.**\n        *   Vertical check (`c=9`): `region_left = grid[:, :9]`. Contains colors 7, 2, 3, 8. `has_foreground(region_left, {0, 4})` -> `True`. `region_right = grid[:, 10:]`. Contains only 0s. `has_foreground(region_right, {0, 4})` -> `False`. Logic: `if pattern_left and not pattern_right: separator_info = ('vertical', 9, 'left')`.\n    *   **Issue:** The code stopped after finding the horizontal separator. The intended output for `train_2` clearly shows a *vertical* reflection. Why did the horizontal check succeed? Because the region *above* the horizontal yellow line (`grid[:9, :]`) technically only contains white (0) and yellow (4), thus `has_foreground` returns `False`. The region *below* (`grid[10:, :]`) *does* contain foreground colors (2, 3, 7, 8). Therefore, the condition `not pattern_above and pattern_below` was met for the horizontal line at `r=9`.\n    *   **Refined Rule:** The separator isn't just *any* yellow line with foreground pixels on one side. It seems to be the line that separates the bulk of the foreground pattern from a mostly empty region. In `train_2`, both the horizontal line at `r=9` and the vertical line at `c=9` satisfy the *exclusive foreground* rule. However, the expected output implies the *vertical* line is the correct axis of reflection. How to distinguish?\n        *   Perhaps the empty region must be *entirely* white (0)? Let's re-test the `_is_region_all_white` logic from the failed code:\n            *   Ex1: `r=9`. `_is_region_all_white(..., 'below')` is True. `_is_region_all_white(..., 'above')` is False. -> `('horizontal', 9, 'above')`. Correct.\n            *   Ex2: `r=9`. `_is_region_all_white(..., 'below')` is False. `_is_region_all_white(..., 'above')` is False. -> No horizontal separator.\n            *   Ex2: `c=9`. `_is_region_all_white(..., 'right')` is True. `_is_region_all_white(..., 'left')` is False. -> `('vertical', 9, 'left')`. Correct.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The logic from the failed code (`_is_region_all_white`) actually identified the correct separators for *both* examples. The failure wasn't in identification, but potentially in the reflection execution or reporting, as suspected earlier. Let's stick with the `_is_region_all_white` identification logic.\n\n*(Self-correction: The discrepancy between the expected output and the provided \"Transformed Output\" for Ex1 in the prompt seems significant. The reflection appears vertically flipped in the provided output compared to the expected. Let's re-examine the calculation `r_tgt = 2 * R - r_src`. For Ex1, R=9. `r_src=1` (row with 5, 2) -> `r_tgt=18-1=17`. `r_src=7` (row with 2, 5, 5) -> `r_tgt=18-7=11`. This matches the *expected* output. The provided `Transformed Output` showed these patterns at rows 17 and 11 respectively, but other rows seemed misaligned. It's highly likely the provided `Transformed Output` display was erroneous, and the core logic was correct but failed some test condition, or the implementation had a subtle bug.)*\n\nLet's proceed assuming the `_is_region_all_white` logic is the correct way to identify the separator and pattern side, and the reflection calculation is `target_coord = 2 * separator_coord - source_coord`.\n\n**Updated Facts**\n\n"
