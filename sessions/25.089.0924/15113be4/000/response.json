These lines occur every 4th row and column (indices 3, 7, 11, 15, 19).\n    *   These yellow lines divide the grid into a 6x6 arrangement of smaller 3x3 subgrids.\n    *   Most 3x3 subgrids contain patterns primarily composed of white (0) and blue (1) pixels.\n    *   Each input grid features exactly one 3x3 subgrid that contains pixels of a color other than white, blue, or yellow. This unique color acts as a \"source\" color (magenta 6 in train\\_1, azure 8 in train\\_2, green 3 in train\\_3). The subgrid containing this color is the \"source\" subgrid.\n    *   The transformation involves changing the color of some blue (1) pixels in the *other* (\"target\") subgrids to the source color identified in the source subgrid.\n    *   The change occurs based on a positional correspondence: A blue pixel in a target subgrid changes to the source color if and only if the pixel at the *same relative position* within the source subgrid has the source color.\n    *   Pixels that are not blue (1) in the target subgrids, or blue pixels whose corresponding position in the source subgrid does not contain the source color, remain unchanged.\n    *   The yellow separator lines remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
