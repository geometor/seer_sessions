elements:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - static
  - role: container
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - static position
      - forms hollow shapes (e.g., 'U', rectangle)
      - encloses an area of background pixels (cavity)
  - role: object_to_move
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - contiguous shape
      - mobile
      - moves as a unit, preserving internal structure
relationships:
  - type: association
    from: object_to_move (gray)
    to: container (red)
    details: Each gray object is associated with one red container, typically the nearest one or the one in the same horizontal/vertical region.
  - type: spatial_goal
    object: object_to_move (gray)
    destination: cavity inside the associated container (red)
    details: The gray object is moved from its initial position to occupy space within the white cavity enclosed by its associated red container.
action:
  - type: move
    actor: object_to_move (gray)
    source: original position on the input grid
    target: position inside the cavity of the associated container (red) on the output grid
    effect:
      - source location becomes background (white)
      - target location becomes gray (object_to_move color)
      - container (red) pixels remain unchanged
