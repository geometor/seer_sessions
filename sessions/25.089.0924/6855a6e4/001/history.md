**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of pixels with colors white (0), red (2), and gray (5).
2.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects:
    *   Red objects (color 2): These appear as hollow shapes or frames (like 'U' shapes or rectangles). They remain static between input and output.
    *   Gray objects (color 5): These are smaller, solid shapes (like squares, rectangles, or bars). They change position from input to output.
    *   Background (color 0): White pixels fill the rest of the grid.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the gray objects.
4.  **Relationship:** The red objects seem to act as "containers" or "destinations" for the gray objects. Each gray object is moved from its original position *into* the empty space enclosed by a nearby red shape.
5.  **Movement Details:**
    *   The relative positions of pixels within a gray object are preserved during the move. The entire gray object moves as a single unit.
    *   The red shapes and their positions are unchanged.
    *   The original locations of the gray objects become white (background) in the output.
    *   The destination location for each gray object is within the cavity (the area of white pixels enclosed by the red shape) of the associated red container. The exact placement seems to fill the cavity space while maintaining the gray object's shape. In examples with multiple red containers, gray objects move to the nearest or most logically associated container (e.g., objects on the left move to the left container, objects on the right move to the right container).

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - static
  - role: container
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - static position
      - forms hollow shapes (e.g., 'U', rectangle)
      - encloses an area of background pixels (cavity)
  - role: object_to_move
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - contiguous shape
      - mobile
      - moves as a unit, preserving internal structure
relationships:
  - type: association
    from: object_to_move (gray)
    to: container (red)
    details: Each gray object is associated with one red container, typically the nearest one or the one in the same horizontal/vertical region.
  - type: spatial_goal
    object: object_to_move (gray)
    destination: cavity inside the associated container (red)
    details: The gray object is moved from its initial position to occupy space within the white cavity enclosed by its associated red container.
action:
  - type: move
    actor: object_to_move (gray)
    source: original position on the input grid
    target: position inside the cavity of the associated container (red) on the output grid
    effect:
      - source location becomes background (white)
      - target location becomes gray (object_to_move color)
      - container (red) pixels remain unchanged
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all distinct red objects (color 2) in the input grid. These act as static containers.
2.  Identify all distinct gray objects (color 5) in the input grid. These are the objects to be moved.
3.  For each gray object:
    a.  Determine which red container object it is associated with (usually based on proximity - e.g., closest distance between the objects or belonging to the same general region of the grid).
    b.  Identify the empty cavity within the associated red container (the connected area of white pixels enclosed by the red pixels).
    c.  Calculate the relative coordinates of all pixels within the gray object.
    d.  Determine the target top-left coordinate within the red container's cavity where the gray object should be placed. The placement should maintain the gray object's original shape and internal structure. The movement direction is typically towards the associated container's cavity.
4.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
5.  For each gray object identified in step 2:
    a.  Change the pixels at its original location in the output grid to white (color 0).
6.  For each gray object identified in step 2:
    a.  Using its calculated target top-left coordinate (from step 3d) and its relative pixel coordinates (from step 3c), draw the gray object (color 5) onto the output grid within the associated red container's cavity.
7.  Ensure all red pixels (color 2) from the input remain unchanged in the output grid.
