            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Each input and output grid is 20x20.\n2.  **Border:** All grids have a single-pixel border of a specific color (maroon, orange, gray, red in the examples). This border remains unchanged in the output.\n3.  **Background:** The area inside the border is predominantly white (0).\n4.  **Input Objects:** Inside the border, each input grid contains two key object types:\n    *   An 'H' shape composed of a single color (magenta, blue, orange, green in the examples). The 'H' shape appears to be consistently formed by two 3-pixel vertical segments separated by one white pixel, connected by a single pixel horizontally in the middle row.\n    *   Two isolated pixels of another identical color (orange, magenta, red, blue in the examples). These two pixels are always located on the same horizontal row, positioned symmetrically relative to the center, often near the border but not touching it.\n5.  **Output Objects:** The output grid retains the border. The original 'H' shape from the input is removed (replaced with white). A *new* 'H' shape is drawn, using the color and row/column positions of the two isolated pixels from the input.\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation involves locating the pair of isolated, identically colored pixels on the same row. Their color determines the color of the new 'H' shape. Their row determines the row of the horizontal bar of the new 'H'. Their columns determine the start and end columns of the horizontal bar and the columns for the vertical bars. The original 'H' shape is erased. The new 'H' shape consists of a horizontal bar connecting the two identified pixel locations and two 3-pixel high vertical bars centered on the horizontal bar at those same column locations.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Scan the input grid (excluding the border) to find two pixels that:\n    *   Have the same color (let this color be `TargetColor`).\n    *   Are not the background color (white).\n    *   Are located on the same row (let this row be `TargetRow`).\n    *   Record their column indices (let them be `Col1` and `Col2`, with `Col1 < Col2`).\n3.

In the output grid, change all pixels belonging to the pre-existing 'H' shape (identified in step 3) to the background color (white, 0).\n6.  In the output grid, draw the new 'H' shape using `TargetColor`:\n    *   Draw a horizontal line on `TargetRow` from `Col1` to `Col2` inclusive.\n    *   Draw a vertical line at `Col1`, covering rows `TargetRow - 1`, `TargetRow`, and `TargetRow + 1`.\n    *   Draw a vertical line at `Col2`, covering rows `TargetRow - 1`, `TargetRow`, and `TargetRow + 1`."
