task_context:
  grid_size: 20x20 (constant)
  background_color: white (0)
  border:
    present: true
    thickness: 1 pixel
    color: variable (maroon, orange, gray, red), preserved in output
objects:
  - type: existing_h_shape
    description: An 'H' shape formed by two 3-pixel vertical segments separated by one pixel, connected by a single horizontal pixel in the middle row.
    color: variable (magenta, blue, orange, green)
    action: removed (pixels changed to white) in the output.
    count_per_input: 1
  - type: isolated_pixel_pair
    description: Two pixels of the same color, located on the same row, symmetrically placed.
    color: variable (orange, magenta, red, blue), different from existing_h_shape color.
    count_per_input: 1 (pair)
    role: determines the properties of the new_h_shape.
    properties:
      color: C
      row: R
      columns: [C1, C2] (where C1 < C2)
  - type: new_h_shape
    description: An 'H' shape constructed based on the isolated_pixel_pair.
    location: created in the output grid.
    color: C (from isolated_pixel_pair)
    structure:
      horizontal_bar: row R, from column C1 to C2.
      left_vertical_bar: column C1, rows R-1, R, R+1.
      right_vertical_bar: column C2, rows R-1, R, R+1.
relationships:
  - isolated_pixel_pair -> new_h_shape (determines color and position)
  - existing_h_shape -> removal (erased in output)
  - border -> preservation (unchanged in output)
