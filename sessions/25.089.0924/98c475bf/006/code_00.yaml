task_context:
  grid_size: 20x20 (constant)
  background_color: white (0)
  border:
    present: true
    thickness: 1 pixel
    color: variable, preserved in output
objects_input:
  - type: target_pixel_pair
    description: Two pixels of the same color, located on the same row, symmetrically placed near but not touching the vertical borders.
    count: 1 (pair)
    properties:
      color: TargetColor (variable: orange, magenta, red, blue)
      row: TargetRow (variable)
      columns: [Col1, Col2] (typically 1 and width-2)
    role: Determines the color and horizontal component of the output shape.
  - type: original_shape
    description: An 'H' shape or similar structure composed of a single color, distinct from TargetColor and border color.
    count: 1
    properties:
      color: EraseColor (variable: magenta, blue, orange, green)
      location: occupies a distinct area within the border.
    role: Determines the vertical structure of the output shape and is erased.
objects_output:
  - type: new_h_shape
    description: An 'H'-like shape constructed based on properties derived from both input objects.
    properties:
      color: TargetColor (from target_pixel_pair)
      horizontal_bar:
        row: TargetRow (from target_pixel_pair)
        columns: Col1 to Col2 (from target_pixel_pair)
      vertical_bars:
        columns: [VCol1, VCol2] (determined by EraseColor of original_shape)
        rows: TargetRow + MinOffset to TargetRow + MaxOffset (range [MinOffset, MaxOffset] determined by EraseColor of original_shape)
actions:
  - action: preserve_border
    description: The border pixels from the input are copied directly to the output.
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Locate the target_pixel_pair and the original_shape in the input grid's inner area. Determine their respective colors (TargetColor, EraseColor) and the location parameters (TargetRow, Col1, Col2).
  - action: erase_original_shape
    description: In the output grid (initialized as a copy of the input), change all pixels matching the EraseColor to the background color (white, 0).
  - action: draw_new_h_shape
    description: Draw the new_h_shape onto the output grid using TargetColor.
    details:
      - Map the EraseColor to its corresponding vertical structure {Columns: (VCol1, VCol2), Relative Height Range: (MinOffset, MaxOffset)}.
        - Magenta (6) -> {Cols: (13, 15), Rows: (-1, 2)}
        - Blue (1) -> {Cols: (2, 4), Rows: (-2, 3)}
        - Orange (7) -> {Cols: (6, 8), Rows: (-2, 2)}
        - Green (3) -> {Cols: (14, 16), Rows: (-1, 1)}
      - Draw the horizontal bar at TargetRow from Col1 to Col2.
      - Draw the first vertical bar at column VCol1, spanning rows TargetRow + MinOffset to TargetRow + MaxOffset.
      - Draw the second vertical bar at column VCol2, spanning rows TargetRow + MinOffset to TargetRow + MaxOffset.
