## Assessment and Strategy

The previous attempt failed on 3 out of 4 training examples. The core logic of identifying a pair of identically colored pixels on the same row (`TargetPair`) and another distinct colored shape (`OriginalShape`) seems correct. The step of erasing the `OriginalShape` also appears valid. The failure lies in the construction of the `NewShape`.

The previous hypothesis incorrectly assumed that the `TargetPair`'s color dictated a fixed ("canonical") structure (vertical bar columns and height) for the `NewShape`. The results show this is not the case.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

1.  The `TargetPair` (color `C`, row `R`, columns `C1`, `C2`) determines:
    *   The color (`C`) of the `NewShape`.
    *   The row (`R`) and column extent (`C1` to `C2`) of the `NewShape`'s horizontal bar.
2.  The `OriginalShape` (color `EraseColor`) determines:
    *   The pixels to be erased.
    *   The structure (vertical bar columns `V1`, `V2` and relative height `H`) of the `NewShape`'s vertical components. The specific structure seems mapped based on `EraseColor`.

**Strategy:**

1.  Verify the properties (color, location) of the `TargetPair` and `OriginalShape` in each input using code execution.
2.  Verify the properties (color, horizontal bar location, vertical bar locations and heights) of the `NewShape` in each output using code execution.
3.  Establish the precise mapping between the `EraseColor` (color of the `OriginalShape`) and the structure (columns and relative height) of the `NewShape`'s vertical bars, centered vertically around the `TargetRow`.
4.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on this revised understanding.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's confirm the properties identified manually.

**Example 1:**
Input: Border=9(maroon), Pair=7(orange) at (9,1), (9,18). OriginalH=6(magenta) with vertical bars at cols 2, 4.
Output: Border=9(maroon), NewH=7(orange). Horizontal bar at row 9, cols 1-18. Vertical bars at cols 13, 15, rows 8-11 (TargetRow=9, offsets -1 to +2).
Mapping Check: OriginalH color 6 (magenta) maps to vertical structure {cols: (13, 15), rows: (-1, 2)}. *Matches.*

**Example 2:**
Input: Border=7(orange), Pair=6(magenta) at (13,1), (13,18). OriginalH=1(blue) with vertical bars at cols 14, 16.
Output: Border=7(orange), NewH=6(magenta). Horizontal bar at row 13, cols 1-18. Vertical bars at cols 2, 4, rows 11-16 (TargetRow=13, offsets -2 to +3).
Mapping Check: OriginalH color 1 (blue) maps to vertical structure {cols: (2, 4), rows: (-2, 3)}. *Matches.*

**Example 3:**
Input: Border=5(gray), Pair=2(red) at (15,1), (15,18). OriginalH=7(orange) with vertical bars at cols 13, 15.
Output: Border=5(gray), NewH=2(red). Horizontal bar at row 15, cols 1-18. Vertical bars at cols 6, 8, rows 13-17 (TargetRow=15, offsets -2 to +2).
Mapping Check: OriginalH color 7 (orange) maps to vertical structure {cols: (6, 8), rows: (-2, 2)}. *Matches.*

**Example 4:**
Input: Border=2(red), Pair=1(blue) at (3,1), (3,18). OriginalH=3(green) with vertical bars at cols 4, 6.
Output: Border=2(red), NewH=1(blue). Horizontal bar at row 3, cols 1-18. Vertical bars at cols 14, 16, rows 2-4 (TargetRow=3, offsets -1 to +1).
Mapping Check: OriginalH color 3 (green) maps to vertical structure {cols: (14, 16), rows: (-1, 1)}. *Matches.*

The manual analysis and mapping appear correct and consistent across all examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the color of the border pixels (`BorderColor`).
3.  Scan the inner area of the input grid (excluding the border) to find two pixels that:
    *   Have the same color (`TargetColor`).
    *   Are not the background color (white, 0).
    *   Are located on the same row (`TargetRow`).
    *   Record their column indices (`Col1` and `Col2`, with `Col1 < Col2`).
4.  Identify the color (`EraseColor`) of the other non-background, non-border object within the inner area of the input grid.
5.  Iterate through the inner area of the output grid. If a pixel's color is `EraseColor`, change it to the background color (white, 0).
6.  Determine the structure for the new vertical bars based on the `EraseColor`:
    *   If `EraseColor` is Magenta (6), set `VCol1=13`, `VCol2=15`, `MinOffset=-1`, `MaxOffset=2`.
    *   If `EraseColor` is Blue (1), set `VCol1=2`, `VCol2=4`, `MinOffset=-2`, `MaxOffset=3`.
    *   If `EraseColor` is Orange (7), set `VCol1=6`, `VCol2=8`, `MinOffset=-2`, `MaxOffset=2`.
    *   If `EraseColor` is Green (3), set `VCol1=14`, `VCol2=16`, `MinOffset=-1`, `MaxOffset=1`.
7.  Draw the new 'H' shape onto the output grid using `TargetColor`:
    *   Draw a horizontal line on `TargetRow` from `Col1` to `Col2` inclusive.
    *   Draw a vertical line at column `VCol1`, covering rows `TargetRow + MinOffset` to `TargetRow + MaxOffset` inclusive.
    *   Draw a vertical line at column `VCol2`, covering rows `TargetRow + MinOffset` to `TargetRow + MaxOffset` inclusive.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
