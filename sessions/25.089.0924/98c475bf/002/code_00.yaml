task_context:
  grid_size: 20x20 (constant)
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: border
    description: A single-pixel thick frame around the grid.
    properties:
      color: variable (maroon, orange, gray, red), consistent within a single example.
      position: rows 0 and height-1, columns 0 and width-1.
    action: preserved in output.
  - type: isolated_pixel_pair
    description: Two pixels located within the area enclosed by the border (not touching the border).
    properties:
      color: variable (orange, magenta, red, blue), referred to as TargetColor. Not the background color. Not the border color.
      count: exactly 2 pixels of this color exist within the inner grid area.
      location: both pixels are on the same row (TargetRow), at different columns (Col1, Col2, with Col1 < Col2).
    role: determines the color and position of the new_h_shape.
    action: These pixels become part of the new_h_shape in the output.
  - type: shape_to_erase
    description: All pixels in the input grid that are NOT the border color, NOT the TargetColor, and NOT the background color. In the examples, this consistently forms an 'H' shape, but the rule should generalize.
    properties:
      color: variable (magenta, blue, orange, green), different from TargetColor and BorderColor.
      location: can be anywhere within the grid, potentially touching the border.
    action: all pixels matching this description are changed to the background color (white, 0) in the output.
  - type: new_h_shape
    description: An 'H' shape constructed in the output grid based on the isolated_pixel_pair.
    properties:
      color: TargetColor (from isolated_pixel_pair).
      location: defined by TargetRow, Col1, Col2.
      structure:
        horizontal_bar: drawn on TargetRow from column Col1 to Col2 inclusive.
        left_vertical_bar: drawn at column Col1, covering rows TargetRow - 1, TargetRow, and TargetRow + 1.
        right_vertical_bar: drawn at column Col2, covering rows TargetRow - 1, TargetRow, and TargetRow + 1.
    action: created in the output grid.
relationships:
  - isolated_pixel_pair -> new_h_shape (determines color and position)
  - shape_to_erase -> removal (erased in output)
  - border -> preservation (unchanged in output)
