            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: erasing one 'H' shape and drawing a new one based on the location and color of an isolated pair of pixels. However, the implementation failed because the `find_objects` function incorrectly excluded pixels adjacent to the border when identifying the object to be erased. This resulted in incomplete erasure of the original 'H' shape in all training examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct Object Identification:** Modify the logic to identify all relevant objects correctly.\n    *   Identify the border color first.\n    *   Specifically search for the pair of isolated, same-colored pixels within the inner grid (excluding the border). Record their color (`TargetColor`), row (`TargetRow`), and columns (`Col1`, `Col2`).\n    *   Identify all pixels to be erased: These are any pixels *not* matching the border color, *not* matching the `TargetColor`, and *not* matching the background color (white, 0). This ensures the entire original 'H' is targeted for removal, regardless of its proximity to the border.\n2.  **Refine Implementation:** Update the code to implement this revised object identification and erasure logic. The drawing logic for the new 'H' appears correct based on the failed examples and can likely remain unchanged.\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the refined understanding.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's analyze one example (train_1) to illustrate the identification process refinement:\n\n**Input (train_1):**\n"
