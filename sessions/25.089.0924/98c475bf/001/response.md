Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the grid's border; its color and position remain unchanged.
2. Scan the input grid (excluding the border) to find two pixels that:
    * Have the same color (TargetColor).
    * Are not the background color (white, 0).
    * Are located on the same row (TargetRow).
    * Record their column indices (Col1 and Col2, with Col1 < Col2).
3. Identify the pixels belonging to the pre-existing 'H' shape object (which will have a different color than TargetColor).
4. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
5. In the output grid, change all pixels belonging to the pre-existing 'H' shape to the background color (white, 0).
6. In the output grid, draw the new 'H' shape using TargetColor:
    * Draw a horizontal line on TargetRow from Col1 to Col2 inclusive.
    * Draw a vertical line at Col1, covering rows TargetRow - 1, TargetRow, and TargetRow + 1.
    * Draw a vertical line at Col2, covering rows TargetRow - 1, TargetRow, and TargetRow + 1.
