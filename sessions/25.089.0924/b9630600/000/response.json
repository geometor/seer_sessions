White forms the background, and green forms various shapes.\n3.  **Objects:** The green pixels form distinct objects, primarily hollow shapes resembling letters (like C, G, H, E) or simple rectangles. These shapes act as boundaries.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve filling enclosed areas. Comparing input and output grids, the green shapes themselves remain unchanged. However, the contiguous white areas *inside* these green boundaries are filled with green in the output.\n5.  **Enclosure:** The filling only occurs for white areas that are completely surrounded by green pixels. White areas connected to the grid boundary or outside the green shapes are left untouched. Adjacency seems to be based on horizontal and vertical neighbors (4-connectivity).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all contiguous regions of white pixels in the input grid.\n3.  For each distinct white region:\n    a.  Determine if this region is fully enclosed by green pixels. This means checking if any pixel within the white region touches the boundary of the grid. A simple way is to perform a search (like flood fill or BFS) starting from any pixel in the region, traversing only white pixels (using 4-way adjacency). If the search can reach any pixel on the grid's border (row 0, last row, column 0, or last column), the region is *not* enclosed.\n    b.  If the white region is determined to be fully enclosed (i.e., the search could not reach the grid boundary), then change the color of all pixels belonging to this specific white region in the *output grid* to green.\n4.
