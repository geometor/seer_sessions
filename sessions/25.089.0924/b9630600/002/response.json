            "text": "**Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core task: filling enclosed white regions with green. The provided code implements this using a standard approach: iterating through the grid, finding unvisited white pixels, and performing a search (BFS) from each to identify its connected region and check for boundary contact. The timeout suggests this approach is too slow for the 30x30 grid size and the complexity of the regions within the ARC environment's time limits.\n\nThe strategy to resolve the timeout is to invert the search logic. Instead of searching each white region individually to see if it *reaches* the boundary, we can perform a single search *starting from* all white pixels on the boundary. Any white pixel reachable from the boundary is considered \"outside\". Any white pixel *not* reached by this search must be enclosed. This typically involves only one major graph traversal, making it more efficient.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nAll training examples use 30x30 grids. The only colors present are white (0) and green (3). Green pixels form boundaries, and the transformation involves changing *some* white pixels to green. The green boundary pixels remain unchanged in all examples.\n\n"
