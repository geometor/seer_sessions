"""
Identifies contiguous regions of white pixels (0) in the input grid.
For each white region, determines if it is fully enclosed by green pixels (3), 
meaning it does not touch the grid boundary (top, bottom, left, or right edge).
If a white region is fully enclosed, fills that region with green (3) in the output grid.
Green pixels from the input remain unchanged. White pixels not enclosed also remain unchanged.
Adjacency is considered using 4 neighbors (up, down, left, right).
