"""
Identifies contiguous regions of white pixels (0) that are fully enclosed by green pixels (3).
A region is considered enclosed if none of its pixels touch the grid boundary (top, bottom, left, or right edge)
through a path of connected white pixels (using 4-way adjacency).
Fills these enclosed white regions with green (3) in the output grid.
Green pixels from the input remain unchanged. White pixels connected to the boundary also remain unchanged.
