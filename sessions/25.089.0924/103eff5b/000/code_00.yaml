task_type: pattern_coloring
grid_properties:
  - separation: Input grid typically has a top pattern and a bottom pattern separated by white space.
  - content: Top pattern uses various colors (not white/0, not azure/8). Bottom pattern uses only azure/8 and white/0.
objects:
  - type: key_pattern
    description: The set of non-white, non-azure pixels, usually located in the upper part of the grid.
    properties: Contains multiple colors; defines the color palette for the transformation.
  - type: lock_pattern
    description: The set of azure (8) pixels, usually located in the lower part of the grid.
    properties: Composed solely of azure pixels; defines the shape to be colored.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_proximity
    from: lock_pixel (each individual azure pixel in the lock_pattern)
    to: key_pixel (each individual colored pixel in the key_pattern)
    attribute: Manhattan distance
actions:
  - action: identify_regions
    input: input_grid
    output: key_pattern_pixels, lock_pattern_pixels
  - action: copy_unchanged
    input: key_pattern_pixels, other_non_lock_pixels
    output: corresponding pixels in output_grid
  - action: determine_color
    input: lock_pixel_coords, key_pattern_pixels_coords_and_colors
    process: For a given lock pixel, calculate Manhattan distance to all key pixels. Find the minimum distance. If multiple key pixels share the minimum distance, select the one that appears first in a row-major scan of the input grid.
    output: color_to_use
  - action: replace_color
    input: lock_pixel_coords, color_to_use
    output: output_grid with the pixel at lock_pixel_coords set to color_to_use
