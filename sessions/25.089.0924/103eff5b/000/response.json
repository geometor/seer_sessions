            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids are divided into two distinct regions, typically separated by several rows of white (0) pixels.\n    *   The **top region** contains a small pattern composed of various colors (excluding white/0 and azure/8). This pattern seems to act as a \"key\" or \"palette\".\n    *   The **bottom region** contains a larger pattern composed exclusively of azure (8) pixels against a white (0) background. This pattern acts as the area to be modified, a \"lock\" or \"canvas\".\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid mirrors the input grid, except for the bottom region.\n    *   The top \"key\" pattern is preserved exactly as it was in the input.\n    *   The bottom \"lock\" pattern's shape (the positions of the originally azure pixels) is preserved, but the azure color (8) is replaced by colors drawn from the top \"key\" pattern.\n3.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation lies in determining *which* color from the top pattern replaces *which* azure pixel in the bottom pattern. Observing the examples suggests a spatial relationship: each azure pixel in the bottom pattern takes on the color of the *closest* colored pixel in the top pattern.\n4.  **Distance Metric:** Calculating the \"closest\" pixel requires a distance metric. Testing both Euclidean and Manhattan distances reveals that Manhattan distance (`|row1 - row2| + |col1 - col2|`) correctly predicts the color replacements in the examples.\n5.  **Tie-breaking:** In cases where an azure pixel is equidistant (by Manhattan distance) from multiple colored pixels in the top pattern, a tie-breaking rule is needed. The examples suggest that the pixel encountered first when scanning the top pattern row-by-row, then column-by-column, determines the color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
