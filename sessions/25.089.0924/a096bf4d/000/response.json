            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for task `train_1`.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: Both input and output grids exhibit a regular structure. They are composed of distinct 4x4 pixel blocks separated by single-pixel wide white (0) borders. The overall grid is formed by arranging these blocks in a larger grid pattern (e.g., 5 rows and 4 columns of blocks in `train_1`).\n2.  **Block Structure**: Each 4x4 block has an outer border of a specific color (red=2 in `train_1`, blue=1 in `train_2`, azure=8 in `train_3`) and an inner 2x2 central region.\n3.  **Central Region Content**: The inner 2x2 region contains pixels of various colors. Within each example pair (input/output), there appears to be a dominant or \"default\" color filling most positions in these central regions across the grid (green=3 in `train_1`, azure=8 in `train_2`, yellow=4 in `train_3`). Other \"non-default\" colors appear less frequently in these central regions.\n4.  **Transformation**: The transformation primarily affects the pixels within the 2x2 central regions. Specifically, pixels with the \"default\" color are sometimes changed. Pixels with \"non-default\" colors in the input seem to remain unchanged in the output. The border pixels (white separators and the colored borders of the 4x4 blocks) also remain unchanged.\n5.  **Rule Identification**: The change seems to be a form of propagation or \"infection\". If a cell within a block's 2x2 center has the \"default\" color, its value in the output grid is determined by looking at the colors in the *corresponding position* within the 2x2 centers of all its adjacent neighboring blocks (including diagonals) in the *input* grid. If any neighbor has a \"non-default\" color at that corresponding position, the current block's cell adopts that non-default color. If all neighbors have the default color (or are border pixels outside a valid center), the cell retains its default color. If multiple neighbors have *different* non-default colors at the corresponding position (which doesn't seem to occur in the examples), a priority rule would be needed, but based on the examples, it appears only one neighbor provides the \"infecting\" color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the repeating 4x4 block structure based on the white (0) borders that form a grid spacing (typically every 5th row and column).\n3.  For each 4x4 block identified:\n    a.  Note the location (top-left corner row `R`, column `C`) of the block.\n    b.  Identify the 2x2 center region of the block (at rows `R+1` to `R+2`, columns `C+1` to `C+2`).\n4.  Determine the \"Default Color\" by counting the occurrences of each color within *all* the 2x2 center regions across the entire input grid. The Default Color is the color with the highest frequency.\n5.  Iterate through each block in the grid (indexed by block row `br` and block column `bc`).\n6.  For the current block at (`br`, `bc`):\n    a.  Iterate through each cell within its 2x2 center region (relative coordinates `dr`, `dc` where `dr`, `dc` are 0 or 1). Let the absolute grid coordinates be `r = R + 1 + dr`, `c = C + 1 + dc`.\n    b.  Check the color of the input grid cell `input[r][c]`.\n    c.  If `input[r][c]` is equal to the Default Color:\n        i.  Initialize an empty list `neighbor_colors`.\n        ii. Iterate through all 8 potential neighboring block positions (`nbr`, `nbc`) relative to the current block (`br`, `bc`) (i.e., `nbr` from `br-1` to `br+1`, `nbc` from `bc-1` to `bc+1`, excluding `nbr=br` and `nbc=bc`).\n        iii. For each neighbor position (`nbr`, `nbc`):\n            1.  Check if this neighbor position is valid (within the grid of blocks).\n            2.  If valid, determine the absolute coordinates (`nr`, `nc`) of the cell corresponding to the *same relative position* (`dr`, `dc`) within the neighbor block's center: `nr = Neighbor_R + 1 + dr`, `nc = Neighbor_C + 1 + dc`.\n            3.  Get the color `neighbor_color = input[nr][nc]`.\n            4.  If `neighbor_color` is *not* the Default Color, add it to the `neighbor_colors` list.\n        iv. Find the unique non-default colors in the `neighbor_colors` list.\n        v.  If there is exactly one unique non-default color found (`source_color`):\n            1.  Update the output grid at the current position: `output[r][c] = source_color`.\n        vi. Otherwise (no non-default neighbors or multiple different ones), the output cell `output[r][c]` retains the Default Color (it's already set from the initial copy).\n    d.  If `input[r][c]` is *not* the Default Color, do nothing (the output cell `output[r][c]` keeps the value from the initial copy).\n7.  Return the completed output grid."
