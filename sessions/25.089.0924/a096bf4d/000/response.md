Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for task `train_1`.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure**: Both input and output grids exhibit a regular structure. They are composed of distinct 4x4 pixel blocks separated by single-pixel wide white (0) borders. The overall grid is formed by arranging these blocks in a larger grid pattern (e.g., 5 rows and 4 columns of blocks in `train_1`).
2.  **Block Structure**: Each 4x4 block has an outer border of a specific color (red=2 in `train_1`, blue=1 in `train_2`, azure=8 in `train_3`) and an inner 2x2 central region.
3.  **Central Region Content**: The inner 2x2 region contains pixels of various colors. Within each example pair (input/output), there appears to be a dominant or "default" color filling most positions in these central regions across the grid (green=3 in `train_1`, azure=8 in `train_2`, yellow=4 in `train_3`). Other "non-default" colors appear less frequently in these central regions.
4.  **Transformation**: The transformation primarily affects the pixels within the 2x2 central regions. Specifically, pixels with the "default" color are sometimes changed. Pixels with "non-default" colors in the input seem to remain unchanged in the output. The border pixels (white separators and the colored borders of the 4x4 blocks) also remain unchanged.
5.  **Rule Identification**: The change seems to be a form of propagation or "infection". If a cell within a block's 2x2 center has the "default" color, its value in the output grid is determined by looking at the colors in the *corresponding position* within the 2x2 centers of all its adjacent neighboring blocks (including diagonals) in the *input* grid. If any neighbor has a "non-default" color at that corresponding position, the current block's cell adopts that non-default color. If all neighbors have the default color (or are border pixels outside a valid center), the cell retains its default color. If multiple neighbors have *different* non-default colors at the corresponding position (which doesn't seem to occur in the examples), a priority rule would be needed, but based on the examples, it appears only one neighbor provides the "infecting" color.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  Structure: Composed of repeating subgrids (Blocks) separated by borders.
  Border_Color: 0 (white) separating Blocks.
Block:
  Type: Subgrid object.
  Size: 4x4 pixels.
  Structure:
    - Outer_Border: 1-pixel thick border, color varies per task (e.g., 2=red, 1=blue, 8=azure).
    - Center: Inner 2x2 pixel area.
  Arrangement: Tiled grid layout (e.g., 5 rows x 4 columns of Blocks).
Center_Region:
  Size: 2x2 pixels.
  Location: Inner area of a Block.
  Pixel_Colors:
    - Default_Color: The most frequent color found across all Center_Regions in the input grid (e.g., 3=green, 8=azure, 4=yellow). Identified per task.
    - Non_Default_Colors: Other colors appearing in Center_Regions.
Transformation:
  Scope: Affects only pixels within the Center_Regions.
  Condition: Applies only to pixels that have the Default_Color in the input grid.
  Rule:
    - For a pixel at relative position (dr, dc) within a Center_Region (where dr, dc can be 0 or 1):
      - If its color is the Default_Color:
        - Examine all 8 neighboring Blocks (adjacent/diagonal).
        - Check the pixel at the same relative position (dr, dc) within each neighbor's Center_Region in the *input* grid.
        - Collect the colors found in those corresponding positions.
        - Filter these collected colors to find any Non_Default_Colors.
        - If exactly one unique Non_Default_Color is found among neighbors:
          - Change the current pixel's color to that Non_Default_Color in the output grid.
        - Else (no Non_Default_Colors found, or multiple different ones - though the latter isn't observed):
          - The pixel retains its Default_Color in the output grid.
      - If its color is already a Non_Default_Color:
        - The pixel remains unchanged in the output grid.
  Invariance:
    - Grid borders (white=0) remain unchanged.
    - Block borders (red=2, blue=1, azure=8, etc.) remain unchanged.
    - Pixels within Center_Regions that are initially Non_Default_Colors remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the repeating 4x4 block structure based on the white (0) borders that form a grid spacing (typically every 5th row and column).
3.  For each 4x4 block identified:
    a.  Note the location (top-left corner row `R`, column `C`) of the block.
    b.  Identify the 2x2 center region of the block (at rows `R+1` to `R+2`, columns `C+1` to `C+2`).
4.  Determine the "Default Color" by counting the occurrences of each color within *all* the 2x2 center regions across the entire input grid. The Default Color is the color with the highest frequency.
5.  Iterate through each block in the grid (indexed by block row `br` and block column `bc`).
6.  For the current block at (`br`, `bc`):
    a.  Iterate through each cell within its 2x2 center region (relative coordinates `dr`, `dc` where `dr`, `dc` are 0 or 1). Let the absolute grid coordinates be `r = R + 1 + dr`, `c = C + 1 + dc`.
    b.  Check the color of the input grid cell `input[r][c]`.
    c.  If `input[r][c]` is equal to the Default Color:
        i.  Initialize an empty list `neighbor_colors`.
        ii. Iterate through all 8 potential neighboring block positions (`nbr`, `nbc`) relative to the current block (`br`, `bc`) (i.e., `nbr` from `br-1` to `br+1`, `nbc` from `bc-1` to `bc+1`, excluding `nbr=br` and `nbc=bc`).
        iii. For each neighbor position (`nbr`, `nbc`):
            1.  Check if this neighbor position is valid (within the grid of blocks).
            2.  If valid, determine the absolute coordinates (`nr`, `nc`) of the cell corresponding to the *same relative position* (`dr`, `dc`) within the neighbor block's center: `nr = Neighbor_R + 1 + dr`, `nc = Neighbor_C + 1 + dc`.
            3.  Get the color `neighbor_color = input[nr][nc]`.
            4.  If `neighbor_color` is *not* the Default Color, add it to the `neighbor_colors` list.
        iv. Find the unique non-default colors in the `neighbor_colors` list.
        v.  If there is exactly one unique non-default color found (`source_color`):
            1.  Update the output grid at the current position: `output[r][c] = source_color`.
        vi. Otherwise (no non-default neighbors or multiple different ones), the output cell `output[r][c]` retains the Default Color (it's already set from the initial copy).
    d.  If `input[r][c]` is *not* the Default Color, do nothing (the output cell `output[r][c]` keeps the value from the initial copy).
7.  Return the completed output grid.
