            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids maintain the same dimensions. A defining feature is a central cross composed entirely of white (0) pixels, dividing the grid into four distinct quadrants.\n2.  **Quadrants:** The grid is clearly partitioned into Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR) quadrants by the white cross.\n3.  **Content within Quadrants:** Each quadrant appears to have a primary 'background' color and one or more pixels of a secondary 'foreground' color. The white cross pixels are separators and seem unchanged by the transformation.\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The core change happens *within* each quadrant, specifically affecting the foreground pixels. The background color and the white cross remain constant.\n5.  **Color Change Rule:** Observing the examples, the foreground pixels within a given quadrant in the input grid are replaced by the background color *of that same quadrant* in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Facts Block:**\n\n"

These are the foreground pixels.\n\nTransformation:\n  - Scope: Operates independently within each of the four quadrants.\n  - Target: Affects only the foreground pixels within each quadrant.\n  - Action: Replaces the color of foreground pixels.\n  - Rule: Foreground pixels in a quadrant are changed to the background color of that *same* quadrant.\n  - Invariants:\n      - The white separator cross remains unchanged.\n      - The background color of each quadrant remains unchanged.\n      - The grid dimensions remain unchanged.\n```"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Separator:** Locate the row index (`r_sep`) and column index (`c_sep`) that consist entirely of white (0) pixels. These define the central cross separator.\n2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid (the output) as an identical copy of the input grid.\n3.  **Define Quadrants:** Use `r_sep` and `c_sep` to define the boundaries for the four quadrants:\n    *   Top-Left (TL): rows `0` to `r_sep-1`, columns `0` to `c_sep-1`.\n    *   Top-Right (TR): rows `0` to `r_sep-1`, columns `c_sep+1` to `width-1`.\n    *   Bottom-Left (BL): rows `r_sep+1` to `height-1`, columns `0` to `c_sep-1`.\n    *   Bottom-Right (BR): rows `r_sep+1` to `height-1`, columns `c_sep+1` to `width-1`.\n4.  **Process Each Quadrant:** Iterate through each of the four quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR). For the current quadrant:\n    a.  **Find Background Color:** Examine all non-white pixels within the quadrant's boundaries in the *input* grid. Determine the most frequent color among them; this is the quadrant's background color.\n    b.  **Identify and Replace Foreground Pixels:** Iterate through each pixel location (`r`, `c`) within the current quadrant's boundaries. If the pixel color in the *input* grid (`input[r][c]`) is neither white (0) nor the identified background color, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid (`output[r][c]`) to the background color.\n5.  **Return Output:** The modified grid is the final output."
