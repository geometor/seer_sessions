            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the core structure of the task: a central white cross separator dividing the grid into four quadrants, with transformations occurring independently within each quadrant. The fundamental idea of replacing 'foreground' pixels with a 'background' color was also correct.\n\nHowever, the specific method for determining the 'background' color was flawed. The initial attempt used the most frequent color adjacent to the separator, with a fallback to the overall most frequent color. The results clearly show this was incorrect, as many foreground pixels were not replaced, or potentially replaced with the wrong color (although the latter is harder to tell definitively from the output mismatch alone).\n\nThe new strategy is to simplify the definition of the background color. Based on re-examination of all examples, the background color for each quadrant appears to be simply the **most frequent non-white (0) color within that quadrant**. Any other non-white color within that quadrant is considered foreground and should be replaced.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
