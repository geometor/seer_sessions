            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the grid structure (quadrants separated by a white cross) and the general transformation pattern (changing foreground pixels within quadrants). However, the method for determining the 'background' color (using the most frequent non-white color) was flawed, leading to incorrect transformations in several cases. The `Transformed Output` often replaced *all* non-white pixels with the erroneously identified background color, which happened to be the foreground color in the failing cases.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the definition of the \"background\" color for each quadrant. The key insight appears to be the relationship between the quadrant's colors and the central white separator. The color directly adjacent to the separator seems to define the background, while other colors are foreground.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the previous run:\n*   All three training examples failed.\n*   The failures stemmed from incorrect identification of the background color within certain quadrants, specifically when the intended foreground color was more numerous than the intended background color.\n*   Example 1 Failure: Incorrect background identified in BR (first part) and BL (second part).\n*   Example 2 Failure: Incorrect background identified in BR (second part).\n*   Example 3 Failure: Incorrect background identified in multiple quadrants (judging by the complete replacement, although the specific errors weren't highlighted in the failure analysis summary, revisiting the comparison shows this).\n\nThe core issue isn't the frequency count itself, but the *criterion* for identifying the background color. The revised hypothesis focuses on adjacency to the separator.\n\n**YAML Facts Block:**\n\n"

This color is identified by its adjacency (sharing an edge or corner) to the white separator pixels bordering the quadrant.\n  - ForegroundPixels: Pixels within a quadrant whose color is neither white (0) nor the identified background color.\n\nTransformation:\n  - Scope: Operates independently within each of the four quadrants.\n  - Target: Affects only the foreground pixels within each quadrant.\n  - Action: Replaces the color of foreground pixels.\n  - Rule: Foreground pixels in a quadrant are changed to the background color of that *same* quadrant (the color adjacent to the separator).\n  - Invariants:\n      - The white separator cross remains unchanged.\n      - The background color pixels of each quadrant remain unchanged.\n      - The grid dimensions remain unchanged.\n```"

These define the central cross separator.\n2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid (the output) as an identical copy of the input grid.\n3.  **Define Quadrants:** Use `r_sep` and `c_sep` to define the boundaries for the four quadrants:\n    *   Top-Left (TL): rows `0` to `r_sep-1`, columns `0` to `c_sep-1`.\n    *   Top-Right (TR): rows `0` to `r_sep-1`, columns `c_sep+1` to `width-1`.\n    *   Bottom-Left (BL): rows `r_sep+1` to `height-1`, columns `0` to `c_sep-1`.\n    *   Bottom-Right (BR): rows `r_sep+1` to `height-1`, columns `c_sep+1` to `width-1`.\n4.  **Process Each Quadrant:** Iterate through each of the four quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR). For the current quadrant:\n    a.  **Find Background Color:** Examine the pixels within the quadrant that are directly adjacent (sharing an edge or corner) to the white separator pixels (`input[r_sep, c]` or `input[r, c_sep]`). Identify the non-white color found among these adjacent pixels. This is the quadrant's background color. *Assume there is only one such non-white color per quadrant adjacent to the separator based on observed examples.*\n    b.  **Identify and Replace Foreground Pixels:** Iterate through each pixel location (`r`, `c`) within the current quadrant's boundaries in the *input* grid. If the pixel's color (`input[r][c]`) is neither white (0) nor the identified background color, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid (`output[r][c]`) to the background color.\n5.  **Return Output:** The modified grid is the final output."
