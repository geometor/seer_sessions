GridProperties:
  - Separator: A central cross (one row, one column) of white (0) pixels exists.
  - Quadrants: The separator divides the grid into four distinct quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR).
  - Dimensions: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.

QuadrantProperties:
  - BackgroundColor: Each quadrant has a specific non-white color designated as its background. This color is identified by its adjacency (sharing an edge or corner) to the white separator pixels bordering the quadrant.
  - ForegroundPixels: Pixels within a quadrant whose color is neither white (0) nor the identified background color.

Transformation:
  - Scope: Operates independently within each of the four quadrants.
  - Target: Affects only the foreground pixels within each quadrant.
  - Action: Replaces the color of foreground pixels.
  - Rule: Foreground pixels in a quadrant are changed to the background color of that *same* quadrant (the color adjacent to the separator).
  - Invariants:
      - The white separator cross remains unchanged.
      - The background color pixels of each quadrant remain unchanged.
      - The grid dimensions remain unchanged.
