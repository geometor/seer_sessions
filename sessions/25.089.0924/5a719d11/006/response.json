            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code execution failed because the method for identifying the \"background\" color within each quadrant was incorrect. The previous assumption (based possibly on adjacency or a simpler rule) did not capture the underlying logic demonstrated across all examples. The results show that the code often identified an incorrect background color or applied the transformation too broadly, changing pixels that should have remained untouched.\n\nThe strategy moving forward is to re-analyze the input-output pairs, focusing specifically on how the background and foreground colors are determined within each quadrant. The consistent pattern across examples suggests that the background color is the non-white color that occupies the most pixels within that quadrant. All other non-white pixels (foreground pixels) are then replaced by this determined background color. The white separator remains invariant.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's verify the pixel counts for non-white colors within each quadrant for the first example to confirm the \"most frequent non-white color is background\" hypothesis.\n\n"
