elements:
  - object: grid
    pixels:
      - color: white (0) - background
      - color: green (3)
      - color: maroon (9)
  - object: blobs
    definition: Contiguous groups of non-white pixels (green or maroon), connected orthogonally.
    properties:
      - maroon_count: number of maroon (9) pixels in the blob.
      - total_size: total number of pixels (green + maroon) in the blob.
      - location: defined by the set of coordinates occupied by the blob pixels.
      - top_left_coordinate: the coordinate (row, col) of the pixel in the blob with the minimum row index, and among those, the minimum column index.

action:
  - name: identify_target_blob
    criteria:
      1. Find the minimum `maroon_count` (min_mc) among all blobs.
      2. Filter blobs where `maroon_count == min_mc`.
      3. If multiple blobs remain, find the maximum `total_size` (max_ts) among the filtered blobs.
      4. Filter blobs where `total_size == max_ts`.
      5. If multiple blobs remain, select the one with the minimum `top_left_coordinate` (first by row, then by column).
  - name: remove_blob
    target: the blob identified by `identify_target_blob`.
    effect: Change the color of all pixels belonging to the target blob to white (0).

relationship:
  - The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the pixels belonging to the removed blob, which are turned white.
