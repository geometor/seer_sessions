We need contiguous blocks (connectivity=1 means touching sides, not diagonals) of non-white pixels. A simple flood fill or BFS/DFS approach can work.\n\n**Revised Plan:**\n1. Iterate through the grid.\n2. If a non-white pixel is found that hasn't been visited yet, start a search (BFS or DFS) from this pixel to find all connected non-white pixels (using 4-way adjacency).\n3. Mark visited pixels during the search.\n4. Store the coordinates, total count, and maroon count for each object found.\n5. After finding all objects, apply Hypothesis 5:\n    a. Find the minimum maroon count.\n    b. Filter objects with this minimum count.\n    c. If > 1, filter further by maximum total size.\n    d. If still > 1 (tie in size), filter by top-most, then left-most coordinate of the object's pixels. (The `tool_code` implicitly did this via sorting, let's make it explicit).\n    e. Identify the coordinates of the selected object.\n    f. Create the output grid by copying the input and setting the selected object's pixels to white (0).\n\nLet's manually apply this to Train 4 again, as the tool failed.\n\n**Train 4 Manual Check (Hypothesis 5):**\n- Input:\n"

An object is a group of connected green (3) or maroon (9) pixels where connection is defined by sharing an edge (up, down, left, or right). Ignore white (0) background pixels.\n2.  For each identified object, calculate two properties:\n    *   `maroon_count`: The total number of maroon (9) pixels within the object.\n    *   `total_size`: The total number of pixels (green and maroon) within the object.\n3.  Determine the minimum `maroon_count` found among all objects.\n4.  Select all objects that have this minimum `maroon_count`.\n5.  If only one object was selected in step 4, this is the target object.

White acts as the background.\n2.  **Object Identification**: The non-white pixels (green and maroon) form distinct contiguous objects or \"blobs\". Contiguity is defined by orthogonal adjacency (sharing a side, not just a corner).\n3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves identifying and removing exactly one of these non-white objects from the input grid to produce the output grid. Removal means changing all pixels constituting the object to the background color (white, 0).\n4.  **Selection Criteria**: The specific object chosen for removal is determined by a hierarchical set of criteria applied to all objects found in the input:\n    *   **Primary Criterion**: The number of maroon (9) pixels within the object. Objects with the *minimum* count of maroon pixels are prioritized.\n    *   **Secondary Criterion (Tie-breaker 1)**: If multiple objects share the same minimum maroon pixel count, the object with the *maximum* total size (total count of green and maroon pixels) is chosen.\n    *   **Tertiary Criterion (Tie-breaker 2)**: If a tie persists after considering both maroon count and total size, the object whose top-most, left-most pixel appears first in standard reading order (minimum row index, then minimum column index) is selected.\n5.  **Output Generation**: The output grid is a direct copy of the input grid, except that all pixels belonging to the single selected object are replaced with white (0).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
