"""
The transformation identifies all distinct connected objects composed of non-background colors (green '3' and maroon '9') using orthogonal adjacency. For each object, it calculates the count of maroon pixels (`maroon_count`) and the total pixel count (`total_size`). It then selects a single object for removal based on a hierarchical criteria: 
1. Minimum `maroon_count`.
2. If tied, maximum `total_size`.
3. If still tied, the object whose top-most, left-most pixel appears first (minimum row index, then minimum column index).
Finally, it creates the output grid by copying the input grid and changing all pixels of the selected object to the background color (white '0').
