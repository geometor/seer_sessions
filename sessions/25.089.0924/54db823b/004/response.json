Correct.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Objects:\n        *   ID 1: M=6, S=35, TL=(1,0)\n        *   ID 2: M=4, S=20, TL=(1,10)\n        *   ID 3: M=3, S=35, TL=(7,6)  <- Min Maroon, Size 35\n        *   ID 4: M=5, S=20, TL=(8,1)\n    *   Selection: Min Maroon is 3 (ID 3). No ties. ID 3 is selected.\n    *   Expected: Remove ID 3. Correct.\n\n**The Problem Revisited:** Why is ID 4 (Maroon=2, Size=6) in Example 1 *not* removed, while objects selected by the same criteria in other examples *are* removed?\n\nLet's compare the *selected* objects:\n*   Ex 1 Selected: ID 4, M=2, S=6\n*   Ex 2 Selected: ID 2, M=1, S=25\n*   Ex 3 Selected: ID 2, M=2, S=15\n*   Ex 4 Selected: ID 3, M=3, S=35\n\nWhat is special about ID 4 in Example 1?\nMaybe there's a threshold? Perhaps objects below a certain size or maroon count are ignored or treated differently?\nThe sizes are 6, 25, 15, 35. Size 6 is the smallest.\nThe maroon counts are 2, 1, 2, 3. Maroon count 1 is the smallest.\n\nHypothesis A: If the selected object's maroon count is the absolute minimum across *all* examples (i.e., 1), it's removed. (Doesn't fit Ex 1, 3, 4).\nHypothesis B: If the selected object's size is above a certain threshold, it's removed. What threshold? Maybe > 10? (Fits Ex 2, 3, 4, and prevents removal in Ex 1).\nHypothesis C: Is there only *one* object with the minimum maroon count in Examples 2, 3, 4, but multiple in Example 1? No, Ex 1 only had one object (ID 4) with the minimum maroon count of 2.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Ex 1 selection process.\nObjects:\nID 1: M=3, S=15\nID 2: M=4, S=16\nID 3: M=5, S=18\nID 4: M=2, S=6  <- Min Maroon\nID 5: M=7, S=28\nID 6: M=3, S=15\n\nMin Maroon = 2. Only ID 4 has M=2. So ID 4 is selected.\nIf the rule was \"remove the selected object UNLESS its size is < X\", what is X?\nSizes of removed objects: 25, 15, 35. Size of not-removed object: 6.\nA threshold like `size > 10` could work.\n\nLet's re-verify the tie-breaking logic for Ex 1 just in case.\nObjects with M=3: ID 1 (S=15, TL=(0,1)), ID 6 (S=15, TL=(10,4)).\nIf Min Maroon was 3:\n  - Candidates: ID 1, ID 6\n  - Max Size: 15 (both match)\n  - Tie break by TL: ID 1 (0,1) vs ID 6 (10,4). ID 1 wins.\nBut Min Maroon is 2, so ID 4 is selected. The tie-breaking isn't relevant here unless my object finding was wrong. Let's trust the code's object finding for now.\n\nLet's test Hypothesis B: **Add a condition that the selected object is only removed if its `total_size` is greater than some threshold, perhaps 10.**\n\n*   Ex 1: Selected ID 4 (Size=6). 6 is not > 10. Do not remove. -> Matches Expected Output.\n*   Ex 2: Selected ID 2 (Size=25). 25 > 10. Remove. -> Matches Expected Output.\n*   Ex 3: Selected ID 2 (Size=15). 15 > 10. Remove. -> Matches Expected Output.\n*   Ex 4: Selected ID 3 (Size=35). 35 > 10. Remove. -> Matches Expected Output.\n\nThis hypothesis seems plausible and fits all examples. Let's tentatively set the threshold at 10. The threshold could be related to the number of objects, grid size, etc., but a fixed value is simpler and fits the data.\n\n**Step 3: Refine Hypothesis/Rule**\n\nUpdate the natural language program and YAML facts.\n\n---\n\n## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies and removes the target object in three out of four training examples (2, 3, 4). However, it incorrectly removes an object in Example 1, where the expected output is identical to the input.\n\nThe failure in Example 1 indicates that the selection criteria (minimum maroon count, maximum size, top-left tiebreak) are incomplete. There must be an additional condition that prevents the removal of the object selected by these criteria in Example 1.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Analyze the properties (maroon count, total size) of the objects identified in all examples, paying close attention to the object selected by the initial criteria in Example 1.\n2.  Compare the properties of the object selected in Example 1 (which should *not* be removed) with the properties of the objects selected and removed in Examples 2, 3, and 4.\n3.  Identify a distinguishing feature or threshold. The analysis suggests that the `total_size` of the selected object might be relevant. The object selected in Example 1 has a size of 6, while the objects removed in the other examples have sizes of 25, 15, and 35.\n4.  Refine the transformation rule to include a size threshold: the selected object is only removed if its `total_size` exceeds a certain value (e.g., 10).\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | # Objects | Object Details (ID: M=Maroon, S=Size, TL=TopLeft) | Selected (Initial Logic) | Selected Size | Output Matched? | Notes |\n| :------ | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------- | :------------ | :-------------- | :---- |\n| 1 | 6 | 1: M=3, S=15, TL=(0,1)<br>2: M=4, S=16, TL=(1,7)<br>3: M=5, S=18, TL=(5,0)<br>**4: M=2, S=6, TL=(6,5)**<br>5: M=7, S=28, TL=(6,11)<br>6: M=3, S=15, TL=(10,4) | ID 4 | 6 | **No** (Expected no removal) | Initial logic selected ID 4 (Min M=2). |\n| 2 | 5 | 1: M=4, S=15, TL=(0,1)<br>**2: M=1, S=25, TL=(1,6)**<br>3: M=2, S=6, TL=(6,2)<br>4: M=5, S=42, TL=(8,8)<br>5: M=2, S=25, TL=(9,1) | ID 2 | 25 | Yes | Initial logic selected ID 2 (Min M=1). |\n| 3 | 6 | 1: M=4, S=15, TL=(0,12)<br>**2: M=2, S=15, TL=(1,1)**<br>3: M=3, S=16, TL=(2,7)<br>4: M=4, S=20, TL=(7,0)<br>5: M=3, S=10, TL=(7,12)<br>6: M=5, S=20, TL=(9,7) | ID 2 | 15 | Yes | Initial logic selected ID 2 (Min M=2). |\n| 4 | 4 | 1: M=6, S=35, TL=(1,0)<br>2: M=4, S=20, TL=(1,10)<br>**3: M=3, S=35, TL=(7,6)**<br>4: M=5, S=20, TL=(8,1) | ID 3 | 35 | Yes | Initial logic selected ID 3 (Min M=3). |\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"

Use orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right) to determine connectivity.

Select all objects that have this minimum count.\n    *   **b.** If only one object was selected in step 3a, this is the candidate object. Proceed to step 4.\n    *   **c.** If multiple objects were selected in step 3a, compare their `total_size`. Find the maximum `total_size` among these selected objects. Select the object(s) from this group that have this maximum `total_size`.\n    *   **d.** If only one object was selected in step 3c, this is the candidate object. Proceed to step 4.\n    *   **e.** If multiple objects were selected in step 3c (meaning they have the same minimum `maroon_count` and same maximum `total_size`), select the single object whose top-left bounding pixel comes first in reading order (minimum row index, then minimum column index). This is the candidate object.\n4.  **Check Size Threshold**: Compare the `total_size` of the candidate object selected in step 3 to a predefined threshold (e.g., 10).\n5.  **Determine Action**:\n    *   If the candidate object's `total_size` is greater than the threshold, the action is to remove this object. Proceed to step 6.\n    *   If the candidate object's `total_size` is not greater than the threshold, the action is to do nothing. Proceed to step 7.\n6.  **Remove Object**: Create a copy of the input grid. Change the color of every pixel belonging to the candidate object (identified in step 3) to white ('0') in the copied grid. This modified grid is the output.\n7.  **No Removal**: If no objects were found in step 1, or if the action determined in step 5 was to do nothing, the output grid is an identical copy of the input grid.## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code correctly processed examples 2, 3, and 4 but failed on example 1. In example 1, the expected output is identical to the input, meaning no object should be removed. However, the initial logic selected and removed an object (ID 4: Maroon=2, Size=6).\n\nComparing the objects selected by the initial logic across all examples:\n- Ex 1 (Not Removed): Size=6\n- Ex 2 (Removed): Size=25\n- Ex 3 (Removed): Size=15\n- Ex 4 (Removed): Size=35\n\nThis suggests an additional condition: the object selected based on minimum maroon count, maximum size, and top-left position is *only* removed if its total size exceeds a certain threshold. The object in Example 1 (size 6) falls below this threshold, while the others (15, 25, 35) exceed it. A threshold value of 10 seems appropriate based on these examples.\n\n**Strategy:** Modify the transformation rule to include this size threshold check after selecting the candidate object.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | # Objects | Object Details (ID: M=Maroon, S=Size, TL=TopLeft)                     | Candidate (Initial Logic) | Candidate Size | Candidate > 10? | Expected Action | Code Action (Initial) | Match (Initial)? |\n| :------ | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------- | :-------------- | :-------------- | :-------------------- | :--------------- |\n| 1       | 6         | 1: M=3, S=15<br>2: M=4, S=16<br>3: M=5, S=18<br>**4: M=2, S=6**<br>5: M=7, S=28<br>6: M=3, S=15 | ID 4                      | 6              | No              | No Removal      | Remove ID 4           | **No**           |\n| 2       | 5         | 1: M=4, S=15<br>**2: M=1, S=25**<br>3: M=2, S=6<br>4: M=5, S=42<br>5: M=2, S=25      | ID 2                      | 25             | Yes             | Remove ID 2     | Remove ID 2           | Yes              |\n| 3       | 6         | 1: M=4, S=15<br>**2: M=2, S=15**<br>3: M=3, S=16<br>4: M=4, S=20<br>5: M=3, S=10<br>6: M=5, S=20 | ID 2                      | 15             | Yes             | Remove ID 2     | Remove ID 2           | Yes              |\n| 4       | 4         | 1: M=6, S=35<br>2: M=4, S=20<br>**3: M=3, S=35**<br>4: M=5, S=20             | ID 3                      | 35             | Yes             | Remove ID 3     | Remove ID 3           | Yes              |\n\n*(Metrics gathered using the `tool_code` execution provided in the thought process)*\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
