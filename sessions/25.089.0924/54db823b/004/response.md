**Step 1 Results & Step 2: Identify the Difference**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Objects:
        *   ID 1: Maroon=3, Size=15, TL=(0,1)
        *   ID 2: Maroon=4, Size=16, TL=(1,7)
        *   ID 3: Maroon=5, Size=18, TL=(5,0)
        *   ID 4: Maroon=2, Size=6, TL=(6,5)  <- Min Maroon
        *   ID 5: Maroon=7, Size=28, TL=(6,11)
        *   ID 6: Maroon=3, Size=15, TL=(10,4)
    *   Selection: Min Maroon is 2 (ID 4). No ties. ID 4 is selected.
    *   Expected: No removal.
    *   Observation: ID 4 was selected, but shouldn't have been removed.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Objects:
        *   ID 1: M=4, S=15, TL=(0,1)
        *   ID 2: M=1, S=25, TL=(1,6)  <- Min Maroon
        *   ID 3: M=2, S=6, TL=(6,2)
        *   ID 4: M=5, S=42, TL=(8,8)
        *   ID 5: M=2, S=25, TL=(9,1)
    *   Selection: Min Maroon is 1 (ID 2). No ties. ID 2 is selected.
    *   Expected: Remove ID 2. Correct.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Objects:
        *   ID 1: M=4, S=15, TL=(0,12)
        *   ID 2: M=2, S=15, TL=(1,1)  <- Min Maroon, Size 15
        *   ID 3: M=3, S=16, TL=(2,7)
        *   ID 4: M=4, S=20, TL=(7,0)
        *   ID 5: M=3, S=10, TL=(7,12)
        *   ID 6: M=5, S=20, TL=(9,7)
    *   Selection: Min Maroon is 2 (ID 2). No ties. ID 2 is selected.
    *   Expected: Remove ID 2. Correct.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Objects:
        *   ID 1: M=6, S=35, TL=(1,0)
        *   ID 2: M=4, S=20, TL=(1,10)
        *   ID 3: M=3, S=35, TL=(7,6)  <- Min Maroon, Size 35
        *   ID 4: M=5, S=20, TL=(8,1)
    *   Selection: Min Maroon is 3 (ID 3). No ties. ID 3 is selected.
    *   Expected: Remove ID 3. Correct.

**The Problem Revisited:** Why is ID 4 (Maroon=2, Size=6) in Example 1 *not* removed, while objects selected by the same criteria in other examples *are* removed?

Let's compare the *selected* objects:
*   Ex 1 Selected: ID 4, M=2, S=6
*   Ex 2 Selected: ID 2, M=1, S=25
*   Ex 3 Selected: ID 2, M=2, S=15
*   Ex 4 Selected: ID 3, M=3, S=35

What is special about ID 4 in Example 1?
Maybe there's a threshold? Perhaps objects below a certain size or maroon count are ignored or treated differently?
The sizes are 6, 25, 15, 35. Size 6 is the smallest.
The maroon counts are 2, 1, 2, 3. Maroon count 1 is the smallest.

Hypothesis A: If the selected object's maroon count is the absolute minimum across *all* examples (i.e., 1), it's removed. (Doesn't fit Ex 1, 3, 4).
Hypothesis B: If the selected object's size is above a certain threshold, it's removed. What threshold? Maybe > 10? (Fits Ex 2, 3, 4, and prevents removal in Ex 1).
Hypothesis C: Is there only *one* object with the minimum maroon count in Examples 2, 3, 4, but multiple in Example 1? No, Ex 1 only had one object (ID 4) with the minimum maroon count of 2.

Let's re-evaluate Ex 1 selection process.
Objects:
ID 1: M=3, S=15
ID 2: M=4, S=16
ID 3: M=5, S=18
ID 4: M=2, S=6  <- Min Maroon
ID 5: M=7, S=28
ID 6: M=3, S=15

Min Maroon = 2. Only ID 4 has M=2. So ID 4 is selected.
If the rule was "remove the selected object UNLESS its size is < X", what is X?
Sizes of removed objects: 25, 15, 35. Size of not-removed object: 6.
A threshold like `size > 10` could work.

Let's re-verify the tie-breaking logic for Ex 1 just in case.
Objects with M=3: ID 1 (S=15, TL=(0,1)), ID 6 (S=15, TL=(10,4)).
If Min Maroon was 3:
  - Candidates: ID 1, ID 6
  - Max Size: 15 (both match)
  - Tie break by TL: ID 1 (0,1) vs ID 6 (10,4). ID 1 wins.
But Min Maroon is 2, so ID 4 is selected. The tie-breaking isn't relevant here unless my object finding was wrong. Let's trust the code's object finding for now.

Let's test Hypothesis B: **Add a condition that the selected object is only removed if its `total_size` is greater than some threshold, perhaps 10.**

*   Ex 1: Selected ID 4 (Size=6). 6 is not > 10. Do not remove. -> Matches Expected Output.
*   Ex 2: Selected ID 2 (Size=25). 25 > 10. Remove. -> Matches Expected Output.
*   Ex 3: Selected ID 2 (Size=15). 15 > 10. Remove. -> Matches Expected Output.
*   Ex 4: Selected ID 3 (Size=35). 35 > 10. Remove. -> Matches Expected Output.

This hypothesis seems plausible and fits all examples. Let's tentatively set the threshold at 10. The threshold could be related to the number of objects, grid size, etc., but a fixed value is simpler and fits the data.

**Step 3: Refine Hypothesis/Rule**

Update the natural language program and YAML facts.

## Assessment and Strategy

The initial code correctly identifies and removes the target object in three out of four training examples (2, 3, 4). However, it incorrectly removes an object in Example 1, where the expected output is identical to the input.

The failure in Example 1 indicates that the selection criteria (minimum maroon count, maximum size, top-left tiebreak) are incomplete. There must be an additional condition that prevents the removal of the object selected by these criteria in Example 1.

**Strategy:**
1.  Analyze the properties (maroon count, total size) of the objects identified in all examples, paying close attention to the object selected by the initial criteria in Example 1.
2.  Compare the properties of the object selected in Example 1 (which should *not* be removed) with the properties of the objects selected and removed in Examples 2, 3, and 4.
3.  Identify a distinguishing feature or threshold. The analysis suggests that the `total_size` of the selected object might be relevant. The object selected in Example 1 has a size of 6, while the objects removed in the other examples have sizes of 25, 15, and 35.
4.  Refine the transformation rule to include a size threshold: the selected object is only removed if its `total_size` exceeds a certain value (e.g., 10).

relationships:
  - The transformation identifies shapes based on connectivity and color composition.
  - A candidate shape is selected by prioritizing minimum maroon pixels, then maximum total size, then top-left position.
  - The final output differs from the input only if a candidate shape is found AND its total size is greater than `MIN_REMOVAL_SIZE_THRESHOLD`. If these conditions are met, the candidate shape's pixels are turned white. Otherwise, the output is identical to the input.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects**: Scan the input grid to find all distinct connected objects composed of non-background colors (green '3' and maroon '9'). Use orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right) to determine connectivity. If no objects are found, proceed directly to step 7.
2.  **Calculate Properties**: For each object found:
    *   Count the number of maroon ('9') pixels it contains (`maroon_count`).
    *   Count the total number of pixels it contains (`total_size`).
    *   Determine its top-left bounding pixel (the pixel with the minimum row index, breaking ties with the minimum column index).
3.  **Select Candidate**: Identify a single candidate object using the following hierarchical criteria:
    *   **a.** Find the minimum `maroon_count` among all identified objects. Select all objects that have this minimum count.
    *   **b.** If only one object was selected in step 3a, this is the candidate object. Proceed to step 4.
    *   **c.** If multiple objects were selected in step 3a, compare their `total_size`. Find the maximum `total_size` among these selected objects. Select the object(s) from this group that have this maximum `total_size`.
    *   **d.** If only one object was selected in step 3c, this is the candidate object. Proceed to step 4.
    *   **e.** If multiple objects were selected in step 3c (meaning they have the same minimum `maroon_count` and same maximum `total_size`), select the single object whose top-left bounding pixel comes first in reading order (minimum row index, then minimum column index). This is the candidate object.
4.  **Check Size Threshold**: Compare the `total_size` of the candidate object selected in step 3 to a predefined threshold (e.g., 10).
5.  **Determine Action**:
    *   If the candidate object's `total_size` is greater than the threshold, the action is to remove this object. Proceed to step 6.
    *   If the candidate object's `total_size` is not greater than the threshold, the action is to do nothing. Proceed to step 7.
6.  **Remove Object**: Create a copy of the input grid. Change the color of every pixel belonging to the candidate object (identified in step 3) to white ('0') in the copied grid. This modified grid is the output.
7.  **No Removal**: If no objects were found in step 1, or if the action determined in step 5 was to do nothing, the output grid is an identical copy of the input grid.## Assessment and Strategy

The initial code correctly processed examples 2, 3, and 4 but failed on example 1. In example 1, the expected output is identical to the input, meaning no object should be removed. However, the initial logic selected and removed an object (ID 4: Maroon=2, Size=6).

Comparing the objects selected by the initial logic across all examples:
- Ex 1 (Not Removed): Size=6
- Ex 2 (Removed): Size=25
- Ex 3 (Removed): Size=15
- Ex 4 (Removed): Size=35

This suggests an additional condition: the object selected based on minimum maroon count, maximum size, and top-left position is *only* removed if its total size exceeds a certain threshold. The object in Example 1 (size 6) falls below this threshold, while the others (15, 25, 35) exceed it. A threshold value of 10 seems appropriate based on these examples.

**Strategy:** Modify the transformation rule to include this size threshold check after selecting the candidate object.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects**: Scan the input grid to locate all distinct connected objects composed of green ('3') and maroon ('9') pixels. Use orthogonal adjacency (sharing a side) for connectivity. If no such objects exist, the output is identical to the input; stop here.
2.  **Calculate Properties**: For each object found, determine:
    *   Its `maroon_count`: the number of maroon ('9') pixels.
    *   Its `total_size`: the total number of green and maroon pixels.
    *   Its `top_left` coordinate: the coordinate of the pixel with the minimum row index, breaking ties using the minimum column index.
3.  **Select Candidate**: Choose a single candidate object by applying these rules sequentially:
    *   **Rule 1 (Min Maroon)**: Find the minimum `maroon_count` among all objects. Keep only objects with this count.
    *   **Rule 2 (Max Size)**: If more than one object remains, find the maximum `total_size` among them. Keep only objects with this size.
    *   **Rule 3 (Top-Left)**: If more than one object still remains, select the one whose `top_left` coordinate comes first in reading order (minimum row, then minimum column).
    *   The single object remaining after applying these rules is the candidate object.
4.  **Apply Size Threshold**: Check if the `total_size` of the candidate object selected in step 3 is greater than 10.
5.  **Generate Output**:
    *   If the candidate object's `total_size` is greater than 10: Create a copy of the input grid and change all pixels corresponding to the candidate object's location to white ('0'). This is the output grid.
    *   If the candidate object's `total_size` is not greater than 10: The output grid is an identical copy of the input grid.
