Okay, the `skimage` library is not available. I need to implement the object finding logic myself or use a simpler approach.

Let's rethink the object identification. We need contiguous blocks (connectivity=1 means touching sides, not diagonals) of non-white pixels. A simple flood fill or BFS/DFS approach can work.

**Revised Plan:**
1. Iterate through the grid.
2. If a non-white pixel is found that hasn't been visited yet, start a search (BFS or DFS) from this pixel to find all connected non-white pixels (using 4-way adjacency).
3. Mark visited pixels during the search.
4. Store the coordinates, total count, and maroon count for each object found.
5. After finding all objects, apply Hypothesis 5:
    a. Find the minimum maroon count.
    b. Filter objects with this minimum count.
    c. If > 1, filter further by maximum total size.
    d. If still > 1 (tie in size), filter by top-most, then left-most coordinate of the object's pixels. (The `tool_code` implicitly did this via sorting, let's make it explicit).
    e. Identify the coordinates of the selected object.
    f. Create the output grid by copying the input and setting the selected object's pixels to white (0).

Let's manually apply this to Train 4 again, as the tool failed.

(G=Green(3), M=Maroon(9), .=White(0))

- **Object Identification & Counts (using BFS/DFS mentally):**
    - **Blob 1** (Starts 1,0): Extends to (5,6). Maroon count = 6 (1,2; 2,5; 3,1; 3,3; 4,4; 5,2). Total size = 29.
    - **Blob 2** (Starts 1,10): Extends to (4,14). Maroon count = 3 (1,12; 1,14; 3,12). Total size = 15.
    - **Blob 3** (Starts 8,1): Extends to (12,4). Maroon count = 4 (9,2; 9,4; 10,4; 11,1; 11,3). Total size = 17.
    - **Blob 4** (Starts 7,6): Extends to (11,12). Maroon count = 3 (8,11; 9,7; 10,9). Total size = 28.

- **Apply Hypothesis 5:**
    - Maroon counts: {6, 3, 4, 3}
    - Minimum maroon count = 3.
    - Objects with min maroon count: Blob 2, Blob 4.
    - Sizes of these objects: Blob 2 = 15, Blob 4 = 28.
    - Maximum size among these = 28.
    - Object with max size: Blob 4.
    - Select Blob 4.
    - Remove Blob 4.

- **Compare with Train 4 Output:**
    - The output grid shows the object starting at (7,6) (Blob 4) removed.
- **Conclusion:** Hypothesis 5 correctly predicts the transformation for all 4 training examples.

Now, formulate the perception, facts, and natural language program based on Hypothesis 5.

**Perception:**
- The input grid contains a white background (color 0) and several distinct objects composed of green (color 3) and maroon (color 9) pixels.
- Objects are defined as contiguous blocks of non-white pixels (using orthogonal adjacency).
- The transformation involves identifying and removing exactly one of these objects.
- The criteria for selecting the object to remove depends first on the count of maroon pixels within the object. The object(s) with the minimum number of maroon pixels are considered.
- If there's a tie (multiple objects have the same minimum number of maroon pixels), the tie is broken by selecting the object with the largest total number of pixels (area).
- If there's still a tie (same minimum maroon count and same maximum area), the tie is broken by selecting the object whose top-most pixel has the smallest row index, and then the smallest column index (top-left rule).
- The selected object is entirely removed, meaning all its pixels (both green and maroon) are changed to white (color 0). The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

**Facts (YAML):**

```yaml
elements:
  - object: grid
    pixels:
      - color: white (0) - background
      - color: green (3)
      - color: maroon (9)
  - object: blobs
    definition: Contiguous groups of non-white pixels (green or maroon), connected orthogonally.
    properties:
      - maroon_count: number of maroon (9) pixels in the blob.
      - total_size: total number of pixels (green + maroon) in the blob.
      - location: defined by the set of coordinates occupied by the blob pixels.
      - top_left_coordinate: the coordinate (row, col) of the pixel in the blob with the minimum row index, and among those, the minimum column index.

action:
  - name: identify_target_blob
    criteria:
      1. Find the minimum `maroon_count` (min_mc) among all blobs.
      2. Filter blobs where `maroon_count == min_mc`.
      3. If multiple blobs remain, find the maximum `total_size` (max_ts) among the filtered blobs.
      4. Filter blobs where `total_size == max_ts`.
      5. If multiple blobs remain, select the one with the minimum `top_left_coordinate` (first by row, then by column).
  - name: remove_blob
    target: the blob identified by `identify_target_blob`.
    effect: Change the color of all pixels belonging to the target blob to white (0).

relationship:
  - The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the pixels belonging to the removed blob, which are turned white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**
1.  Identify all separate objects in the input grid. An object is a group of connected green (3) or maroon (9) pixels where connection is defined by sharing an edge (up, down, left, or right). Ignore white (0) background pixels.
2.  For each identified object, calculate two properties:
    *   `maroon_count`: The total number of maroon (9) pixels within the object.
    *   `total_size`: The total number of pixels (green and maroon) within the object.
3.  Determine the minimum `maroon_count` found among all objects.
4.  Select all objects that have this minimum `maroon_count`.
5.  If only one object was selected in step 4, this is the target object. Proceed to step 8.
6.  If multiple objects were selected in step 4, compare their `total_size`. Find the maximum `total_size` among these selected objects.
7.  Select the object(s) from step 6 that have this maximum `total_size`. If there is only one, this is the target object. If there is still a tie (multiple objects with the same minimum `maroon_count` and same maximum `total_size`), select the object whose top-most, left-most pixel comes first in reading order (minimum row index, then minimum column index). This is the target object.
8.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
9.  Change the color of every pixel belonging to the target object to white (0) in the output grid.**Perception**

1.  **Grid Composition**: The input and output grids are composed of pixels with three distinct colors: white (0), green (3), and maroon (9). White acts as the background.
2.  **Object Identification**: The non-white pixels (green and maroon) form distinct contiguous objects or "blobs". Contiguity is defined by orthogonal adjacency (sharing a side, not just a corner).
3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves identifying and removing exactly one of these non-white objects from the input grid to produce the output grid. Removal means changing all pixels constituting the object to the background color (white, 0).
4.  **Selection Criteria**: The specific object chosen for removal is determined by a hierarchical set of criteria applied to all objects found in the input:
    *   **Primary Criterion**: The number of maroon (9) pixels within the object. Objects with the *minimum* count of maroon pixels are prioritized.
    *   **Secondary Criterion (Tie-breaker 1)**: If multiple objects share the same minimum maroon pixel count, the object with the *maximum* total size (total count of green and maroon pixels) is chosen.
    *   **Tertiary Criterion (Tie-breaker 2)**: If a tie persists after considering both maroon count and total size, the object whose top-most, left-most pixel appears first in standard reading order (minimum row index, then minimum column index) is selected.
5.  **Output Generation**: The output grid is a direct copy of the input grid, except that all pixels belonging to the single selected object are replaced with white (0).

    description: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels within the grid.

    properties:
      - maroon_count: The number of maroon (9) pixels in the shape.
      - total_size: The total number of pixels (green and maroon) in the shape.

      2. Filter shapes to keep only those where `shape.maroon_count == min_maroon_count`. Let this be `candidates_1`.
      3. If `len(candidates_1) == 1`, return the single shape.
      4. Else, calculate `max_total_size` = maximum `total_size` among shapes in `candidates_1`.
      5. Filter `candidates_1` to keep only those where `shape.total_size == max_total_size`. Let this be `candidates_2`.
      6. If `len(candidates_2) == 1`, return the single shape.
      7. Else, sort `candidates_2` based on `top_left` coordinates (first by row, then by column). Return the first shape in the sorted list.
  - name: generate_output_grid
    input:
      - input_grid: original grid
      - shape_to_remove: the shape selected by `select_shape_for_removal`
    output: output_grid
    logic:
      1. Create a copy of the `input_grid`.
      2. For each pixel coordinate in `shape_to_remove.location`:
         Set the pixel at that coordinate in the copied grid to white (0).
      3. Return the modified grid copy.

relationships:
  - The transformation identifies shapes based on connectivity and color composition.
  - The selection process prioritizes minimizing maroon pixels, then maximizing total size, then top-left position.
  - The final output differs from the input only by the removal (conversion to white) of the single selected shape.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects**: Scan the input grid to find all distinct connected objects composed of non-background colors (green '3' and maroon '9'). Use orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right) to determine connectivity.
2.  **Calculate Properties**: For each object found:
    *   Count the number of maroon ('9') pixels it contains (`maroon_count`).
    *   Count the total number of pixels it contains (`total_size`).
    *   Determine its top-left bounding pixel (the pixel with the minimum row index, breaking ties with the minimum column index).
3.  **Filter by Minimum Maroon Count**: Find the minimum `maroon_count` among all identified objects. Create a list containing only the objects that have this minimum count.
4.  **Filter by Maximum Size (if necessary)**: If the list from step 3 contains more than one object, find the maximum `total_size` among the objects in this list. Update the list to contain only the objects that have this maximum size.
5.  **Filter by Position (if necessary)**: If the list from step 4 still contains more than one object, select the single object whose top-left bounding pixel has the smallest row index. If there's still a tie (same minimum row index), select the one among the tied objects whose top-left bounding pixel has the smallest column index.
6.  **Generate Output**: Create a copy of the input grid. For the single object selected in the previous steps, change the color of all pixels belonging to that object to white ('0') in the copied grid. The resulting grid is the output.

**Step 1 Results & Step 2: Identify the Difference**

*   **Example 1:**

        *   ID 6: Maroon=3, Size=15, TL=(10,4)

        *   ID 2: M=2, S=15, TL=(1,1)  <- Min Maroon, Size 15
        *   ID 3: M=3, S=16, TL=(2,7)
        *   ID 4: M=4, S=20, TL=(7,0)
        *   ID 5: M=3, S=10, TL=(7,12)
        *   ID 6: M=5, S=20, TL=(9,7)
    *   Selection: Min Maroon is 2 (ID 2). No ties. ID 2 is selected.
    *   Expected: Remove ID 2. Correct.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Objects:
        *   ID 1: M=6, S=35, TL=(1,0)
        *   ID 2: M=4, S=20, TL=(1,10)
        *   ID 3: M=3, S=35, TL=(7,6)  <- Min Maroon, Size 35
        *   ID 4: M=5, S=20, TL=(8,1)
    *   Selection: Min Maroon is 3 (ID 3). No ties. ID 3 is selected.
    *   Expected: Remove ID 3. Correct.

**The Problem Revisited:** Why is ID 4 (Maroon=2, Size=6) in Example 1 *not* removed, while objects selected by the same criteria in other examples *are* removed?

Let's compare the *selected* objects:
*   Ex 1 Selected: ID 4, M=2, S=6
*   Ex 2 Selected: ID 2, M=1, S=25
*   Ex 3 Selected: ID 2, M=2, S=15
*   Ex 4 Selected: ID 3, M=3, S=35

What is special about ID 4 in Example 1?
Maybe there's a threshold? Perhaps objects below a certain size or maroon count are ignored or treated differently?
The sizes are 6, 25, 15, 35. Size 6 is the smallest.
The maroon counts are 2, 1, 2, 3. Maroon count 1 is the smallest.

Hypothesis A: If the selected object's maroon count is the absolute minimum across *all* examples (i.e., 1), it's removed. (Doesn't fit Ex 1, 3, 4).
Hypothesis B: If the selected object's size is above a certain threshold, it's removed. What threshold? Maybe > 10? (Fits Ex 2, 3, 4, and prevents removal in Ex 1).
Hypothesis C: Is there only *one* object with the minimum maroon count in Examples 2, 3, 4, but multiple in Example 1? No, Ex 1 only had one object (ID 4) with the minimum maroon count of 2.

Let's re-evaluate Ex 1 selection process.
Objects:
ID 1: M=3, S=15
ID 2: M=4, S=16
ID 3: M=5, S=18
ID 4: M=2, S=6  <- Min Maroon
ID 5: M=7, S=28
ID 6: M=3, S=15

Min Maroon = 2. Only ID 4 has M=2. So ID 4 is selected.
If the rule was "remove the selected object UNLESS its size is < X", what is X?
Sizes of removed objects: 25, 15, 35. Size of not-removed object: 6.
A threshold like `size > 10` could work.

Let's re-verify the tie-breaking logic for Ex 1 just in case.
Objects with M=3: ID 1 (S=15, TL=(0,1)), ID 6 (S=15, TL=(10,4)).
If Min Maroon was 3:
  - Candidates: ID 1, ID 6
  - Max Size: 15 (both match)
  - Tie break by TL: ID 1 (0,1) vs ID 6 (10,4). ID 1 wins.
But Min Maroon is 2, so ID 4 is selected. The tie-breaking isn't relevant here unless my object finding was wrong. Let's trust the code's object finding for now.

Let's test Hypothesis B: **Add a condition that the selected object is only removed if its `total_size` is greater than some threshold, perhaps 10.**

*   Ex 1: Selected ID 4 (Size=6). 6 is not > 10. Do not remove. -> Matches Expected Output.
*   Ex 2: Selected ID 2 (Size=25). 25 > 10. Remove. -> Matches Expected Output.
*   Ex 3: Selected ID 2 (Size=15). 15 > 10. Remove. -> Matches Expected Output.
*   Ex 4: Selected ID 3 (Size=35). 35 > 10. Remove. -> Matches Expected Output.

This hypothesis seems plausible and fits all examples. Let's tentatively set the threshold at 10. The threshold could be related to the number of objects, grid size, etc., but a fixed value is simpler and fits the data.

**Step 3: Refine Hypothesis/Rule**

Update the natural language program and YAML facts.

## Assessment and Strategy

The initial code correctly identifies and removes the target object in three out of four training examples (2, 3, 4). However, it incorrectly removes an object in Example 1, where the expected output is identical to the input.

The failure in Example 1 indicates that the selection criteria (minimum maroon count, maximum size, top-left tiebreak) are incomplete. There must be an additional condition that prevents the removal of the object selected by these criteria in Example 1.

**Strategy:**
1.  Analyze the properties (maroon count, total size) of the objects identified in all examples, paying close attention to the object selected by the initial criteria in Example 1.
2.  Compare the properties of the object selected in Example 1 (which should *not* be removed) with the properties of the objects selected and removed in Examples 2, 3, and 4.
3.  Identify a distinguishing feature or threshold. The analysis suggests that the `total_size` of the selected object might be relevant. The object selected in Example 1 has a size of 6, while the objects removed in the other examples have sizes of 25, 15, and 35.
4.  Refine the transformation rule to include a size threshold: the selected object is only removed if its `total_size` exceeds a certain value (e.g., 10).

      7. If `len(candidates_2) == 1`, return the single shape.
      8. Else, sort `candidates_2` based on `top_left` coordinates (first by row, then by column). Return the first shape in the sorted list.

    input:
      - input_grid: original grid
      - candidate_shape: the shape selected by `select_candidate_shape`
    output: output_grid
    logic:
      1. Create a copy of the `input_grid`.
      2. If `candidate_shape` is not None AND `candidate_shape.total_size > MIN_REMOVAL_SIZE_THRESHOLD`:
         For each pixel coordinate in `candidate_shape.location`:
           Set the pixel at that coordinate in the copied grid to white (0).
      3. Return the (potentially modified) grid copy.

relationships:
  - The transformation identifies shapes based on connectivity and color composition.
  - A candidate shape is selected by prioritizing minimum maroon pixels, then maximum total size, then top-left position.
  - The final output differs from the input only if a candidate shape is found AND its total size is greater than `MIN_REMOVAL_SIZE_THRESHOLD`. If these conditions are met, the candidate shape's pixels are turned white. Otherwise, the output is identical to the input.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects**: Scan the input grid to find all distinct connected objects composed of non-background colors (green '3' and maroon '9'). Use orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right) to determine connectivity. If no objects are found, proceed directly to step 7.
2.  **Calculate Properties**: For each object found:
    *   Count the number of maroon ('9') pixels it contains (`maroon_count`).
    *   Count the total number of pixels it contains (`total_size`).
    *   Determine its top-left bounding pixel (the pixel with the minimum row index, breaking ties with the minimum column index).
3.  **Select Candidate**: Identify a single candidate object using the following hierarchical criteria:
    *   **a.** Find the minimum `maroon_count` among all identified objects. Select all objects that have this minimum count.
    *   **b.** If only one object was selected in step 3a, this is the candidate object. Proceed to step 4.
    *   **c.** If multiple objects were selected in step 3a, compare their `total_size`. Find the maximum `total_size` among these selected objects. Select the object(s) from this group that have this maximum `total_size`.
    *   **d.** If only one object was selected in step 3c, this is the candidate object. Proceed to step 4.
    *   **e.** If multiple objects were selected in step 3c (meaning they have the same minimum `maroon_count` and same maximum `total_size`), select the single object whose top-left bounding pixel comes first in reading order (minimum row index, then minimum column index). This is the candidate object.
4.  **Check Size Threshold**: Compare the `total_size` of the candidate object selected in step 3 to a predefined threshold (e.g., 10).
5.  **Determine Action**:
    *   If the candidate object's `total_size` is greater than the threshold, the action is to remove this object. Proceed to step 6.
    *   If the candidate object's `total_size` is not greater than the threshold, the action is to do nothing. Proceed to step 7.
6.  **Remove Object**: Create a copy of the input grid. Change the color of every pixel belonging to the candidate object (identified in step 3) to white ('0') in the copied grid. This modified grid is the output.
7.  **No Removal**: If no objects were found in step 1, or if the action determined in step 5 was to do nothing, the output grid is an identical copy of the input grid.## Assessment and Strategy

The initial code correctly processed examples 2, 3, and 4 but failed on example 1. In example 1, the expected output is identical to the input, meaning no object should be removed. However, the initial logic selected and removed an object (ID 4: Maroon=2, Size=6).

Comparing the objects selected by the initial logic across all examples:
- Ex 1 (Not Removed): Size=6
- Ex 2 (Removed): Size=25
- Ex 3 (Removed): Size=15
- Ex 4 (Removed): Size=35

This suggests an additional condition: the object selected based on minimum maroon count, maximum size, and top-left position is *only* removed if its total size exceeds a certain threshold. The object in Example 1 (size 6) falls below this threshold, while the others (15, 25, 35) exceed it. A threshold value of 10 seems appropriate based on these examples.

**Strategy:** Modify the transformation rule to include this size threshold check after selecting the candidate object.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects**: Scan the input grid to locate all distinct connected objects composed of green ('3') and maroon ('9') pixels. Use orthogonal adjacency (sharing a side) for connectivity. If no such objects exist, the output is identical to the input; stop here.
2.  **Calculate Properties**: For each object found, determine:
    *   Its `maroon_count`: the number of maroon ('9') pixels.
    *   Its `total_size`: the total number of green and maroon pixels.
    *   Its `top_left` coordinate: the coordinate of the pixel with the minimum row index, breaking ties using the minimum column index.
3.  **Select Candidate**: Choose a single candidate object by applying these rules sequentially:
    *   **Rule 1 (Min Maroon)**: Find the minimum `maroon_count` among all objects. Keep only objects with this count.
    *   **Rule 2 (Max Size)**: If more than one object remains, find the maximum `total_size` among them. Keep only objects with this size.
    *   **Rule 3 (Top-Left)**: If more than one object still remains, select the one whose `top_left` coordinate comes first in reading order (minimum row, then minimum column).
    *   The single object remaining after applying these rules is the candidate object.
4.  **Apply Size Threshold**: Check if the `total_size` of the candidate object selected in step 3 is greater than 10.
5.  **Generate Output**:
    *   If the candidate object's `total_size` is greater than 10: Create a copy of the input grid and change all pixels corresponding to the candidate object's location to white ('0'). This is the output grid.
    *   If the candidate object's `total_size` is not greater than 10: The output grid is an identical copy of the input grid.
