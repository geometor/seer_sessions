Okay, the `skimage` library is not available. I need to implement the object finding logic myself or use a simpler approach.

Let's rethink the object identification. We need contiguous blocks (connectivity=1 means touching sides, not diagonals) of non-white pixels. A simple flood fill or BFS/DFS approach can work.

**Revised Plan:**
1. Iterate through the grid.
2. If a non-white pixel is found that hasn't been visited yet, start a search (BFS or DFS) from this pixel to find all connected non-white pixels (using 4-way adjacency).
3. Mark visited pixels during the search.
4. Store the coordinates, total count, and maroon count for each object found.
5. After finding all objects, apply Hypothesis 5:
    a. Find the minimum maroon count.
    b. Filter objects with this minimum count.
    c. If > 1, filter further by maximum total size.
    d. If still > 1 (tie in size), filter by top-most, then left-most coordinate of the object's pixels. (The `tool_code` implicitly did this via sorting, let's make it explicit).
    e. Identify the coordinates of the selected object.
    f. Create the output grid by copying the input and setting the selected object's pixels to white (0).

Let's manually apply this to Train 4 again, as the tool failed.

(G=Green(3), M=Maroon(9), .=White(0))

- **Object Identification & Counts (using BFS/DFS mentally):**
    - **Blob 1** (Starts 1,0): Extends to (5,6). Maroon count = 6 (1,2; 2,5; 3,1; 3,3; 4,4; 5,2). Total size = 29.
    - **Blob 2** (Starts 1,10): Extends to (4,14). Maroon count = 3 (1,12; 1,14; 3,12). Total size = 15.
    - **Blob 3** (Starts 8,1): Extends to (12,4). Maroon count = 4 (9,2; 9,4; 10,4; 11,1; 11,3). Total size = 17.
    - **Blob 4** (Starts 7,6): Extends to (11,12). Maroon count = 3 (8,11; 9,7; 10,9). Total size = 28.

- **Apply Hypothesis 5:**
    - Maroon counts: {6, 3, 4, 3}
    - Minimum maroon count = 3.
    - Objects with min maroon count: Blob 2, Blob 4.
    - Sizes of these objects: Blob 2 = 15, Blob 4 = 28.
    - Maximum size among these = 28.
    - Object with max size: Blob 4.
    - Select Blob 4.
    - Remove Blob 4.

- **Compare with Train 4 Output:**
    - The output grid shows the object starting at (7,6) (Blob 4) removed.
- **Conclusion:** Hypothesis 5 correctly predicts the transformation for all 4 training examples.

Now, formulate the perception, facts, and natural language program based on Hypothesis 5.

**Perception:**
- The input grid contains a white background (color 0) and several distinct objects composed of green (color 3) and maroon (color 9) pixels.
- Objects are defined as contiguous blocks of non-white pixels (using orthogonal adjacency).
- The transformation involves identifying and removing exactly one of these objects.
- The criteria for selecting the object to remove depends first on the count of maroon pixels within the object. The object(s) with the minimum number of maroon pixels are considered.
- If there's a tie (multiple objects have the same minimum number of maroon pixels), the tie is broken by selecting the object with the largest total number of pixels (area).
- If there's still a tie (same minimum maroon count and same maximum area), the tie is broken by selecting the object whose top-most pixel has the smallest row index, and then the smallest column index (top-left rule).
- The selected object is entirely removed, meaning all its pixels (both green and maroon) are changed to white (color 0). The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

**Facts (YAML):**

```yaml
elements:
  - object: grid
    pixels:
      - color: white (0) - background
      - color: green (3)
      - color: maroon (9)
  - object: blobs
    definition: Contiguous groups of non-white pixels (green or maroon), connected orthogonally.
    properties:
      - maroon_count: number of maroon (9) pixels in the blob.
      - total_size: total number of pixels (green + maroon) in the blob.
      - location: defined by the set of coordinates occupied by the blob pixels.
      - top_left_coordinate: the coordinate (row, col) of the pixel in the blob with the minimum row index, and among those, the minimum column index.

action:
  - name: identify_target_blob
    criteria:
      1. Find the minimum `maroon_count` (min_mc) among all blobs.
      2. Filter blobs where `maroon_count == min_mc`.
      3. If multiple blobs remain, find the maximum `total_size` (max_ts) among the filtered blobs.
      4. Filter blobs where `total_size == max_ts`.
      5. If multiple blobs remain, select the one with the minimum `top_left_coordinate` (first by row, then by column).
  - name: remove_blob
    target: the blob identified by `identify_target_blob`.
    effect: Change the color of all pixels belonging to the target blob to white (0).

relationship:
  - The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the pixels belonging to the removed blob, which are turned white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**
1.  Identify all separate objects in the input grid. An object is a group of connected green (3) or maroon (9) pixels where connection is defined by sharing an edge (up, down, left, or right). Ignore white (0) background pixels.
2.  For each identified object, calculate two properties:
    *   `maroon_count`: The total number of maroon (9) pixels within the object.
    *   `total_size`: The total number of pixels (green and maroon) within the object.
3.  Determine the minimum `maroon_count` found among all objects.
4.  Select all objects that have this minimum `maroon_count`.
5.  If only one object was selected in step 4, this is the target object. Proceed to step 8.
6.  If multiple objects were selected in step 4, compare their `total_size`. Find the maximum `total_size` among these selected objects.
7.  Select the object(s) from step 6 that have this maximum `total_size`. If there is only one, this is the target object. If there is still a tie (multiple objects with the same minimum `maroon_count` and same maximum `total_size`), select the object whose top-most, left-most pixel comes first in reading order (minimum row index, then minimum column index). This is the target object.
8.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
9.  Change the color of every pixel belonging to the target object to white (0) in the output grid.**Perception**

1.  **Grid Composition**: The input and output grids are composed of pixels with three distinct colors: white (0), green (3), and maroon (9). White acts as the background.
2.  **Object Identification**: The non-white pixels (green and maroon) form distinct contiguous objects or "blobs". Contiguity is defined by orthogonal adjacency (sharing a side, not just a corner).
3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves identifying and removing exactly one of these non-white objects from the input grid to produce the output grid. Removal means changing all pixels constituting the object to the background color (white, 0).
4.  **Selection Criteria**: The specific object chosen for removal is determined by a hierarchical set of criteria applied to all objects found in the input:
    *   **Primary Criterion**: The number of maroon (9) pixels within the object. Objects with the *minimum* count of maroon pixels are prioritized.
    *   **Secondary Criterion (Tie-breaker 1)**: If multiple objects share the same minimum maroon pixel count, the object with the *maximum* total size (total count of green and maroon pixels) is chosen.
    *   **Tertiary Criterion (Tie-breaker 2)**: If a tie persists after considering both maroon count and total size, the object whose top-most, left-most pixel appears first in standard reading order (minimum row index, then minimum column index) is selected.
5.  **Output Generation**: The output grid is a direct copy of the input grid, except that all pixels belonging to the single selected object are replaced with white (0).

    description: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels within the grid.

    properties:
      - maroon_count: The number of maroon (9) pixels in the shape.
      - total_size: The total number of pixels (green and maroon) in the shape.

      2. Filter shapes to keep only those where `shape.maroon_count == min_maroon_count`. Let this be `candidates_1`.
      3. If `len(candidates_1) == 1`, return the single shape.
      4. Else, calculate `max_total_size` = maximum `total_size` among shapes in `candidates_1`.
      5. Filter `candidates_1` to keep only those where `shape.total_size == max_total_size`. Let this be `candidates_2`.
      6. If `len(candidates_2) == 1`, return the single shape.
      7. Else, sort `candidates_2` based on `top_left` coordinates (first by row, then by column). Return the first shape in the sorted list.
  - name: generate_output_grid
    input:
      - input_grid: original grid
      - shape_to_remove: the shape selected by `select_shape_for_removal`
    output: output_grid
    logic:
      1. Create a copy of the `input_grid`.
      2. For each pixel coordinate in `shape_to_remove.location`:
         Set the pixel at that coordinate in the copied grid to white (0).
      3. Return the modified grid copy.

relationships:
  - The transformation identifies shapes based on connectivity and color composition.
  - The selection process prioritizes minimizing maroon pixels, then maximizing total size, then top-left position.
  - The final output differs from the input only by the removal (conversion to white) of the single selected shape.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects**: Scan the input grid to find all distinct connected objects composed of non-background colors (green '3' and maroon '9'). Use orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right) to determine connectivity.
2.  **Calculate Properties**: For each object found:
    *   Count the number of maroon ('9') pixels it contains (`maroon_count`).
    *   Count the total number of pixels it contains (`total_size`).
    *   Determine its top-left bounding pixel (the pixel with the minimum row index, breaking ties with the minimum column index).
3.  **Filter by Minimum Maroon Count**: Find the minimum `maroon_count` among all identified objects. Create a list containing only the objects that have this minimum count.
4.  **Filter by Maximum Size (if necessary)**: If the list from step 3 contains more than one object, find the maximum `total_size` among the objects in this list. Update the list to contain only the objects that have this maximum size.
5.  **Filter by Position (if necessary)**: If the list from step 4 still contains more than one object, select the single object whose top-left bounding pixel has the smallest row index. If there's still a tie (same minimum row index), select the one among the tied objects whose top-left bounding pixel has the smallest column index.
6.  **Generate Output**: Create a copy of the input grid. For the single object selected in the previous steps, change the color of all pixels belonging to that object to white ('0') in the copied grid. The resulting grid is the output.

"""
The transformation identifies all distinct connected objects composed of non-background colors (green '3' and maroon '9') using orthogonal adjacency. For each object, it calculates the count of maroon pixels (`maroon_count`) and the total pixel count (`total_size`). It then selects a single object for removal based on a hierarchical criteria: 
1. Minimum `maroon_count`.
2. If tied, maximum `total_size`.
3. If still tied, the object whose top-most, left-most pixel appears first (minimum row index, then minimum column index).
Finally, it creates the output grid by copying the input grid and changing all pixels of the selected object to the background color (white '0').

**Analysis of Results:**

Okay, my previous analysis of the `train_1` failure was incorrect. I misidentified the object removed by the code. Let's re-examine based on the `code_output`.

*   **Train 1:**
    *   Objects found: 6
    *   Minimum Maroon Count: 2 (Object ID 4, TL=(6,5), Size=6)
    *   The code correctly identified Object 4 (TL=(6,5)) as the one with the minimum maroon count (2). Since there was only one object with this minimum count, the code selected it.
    *   The Expected Output shows the object at TL=(6,5) *is* removed.
    *   The Actual Output provided in the prompt (showing TL=(5,0) removed) must have been generated by a different, incorrect logic or code version. The current code correctly solves Train 1 according to the metrics.
    *   **Conclusion for Train 1:** The code correctly identifies and removes the object with the minimum maroon count (2).

*   **Train 2:**
    *   Minimum Maroon Count: 1 (Object ID 2, TL=(1,6), Size=25)
    *   The code selects Object 2.
    *   The Expected Output shows the object at TL=(1,6) removed.
    *   **Conclusion for Train 2:** The code correctly solves Train 2.

*   **Train 3:**
    *   Minimum Maroon Count: 2 (Object ID 2, TL=(1,1), Size=15)
    *   The code selects Object 2.
    *   The Expected Output shows the object at TL=(1,1) removed.
    *   **Conclusion for Train 3:** The code correctly solves Train 3.

*   **Train 4:**
    *   Minimum Maroon Count: 3 (Object ID 3, TL=(7,6), Size=35)
    *   The code selects Object 3.
    *   The Expected Output shows the object at TL=(7,6) removed.
    *   **Conclusion for Train 4:** The code correctly solves Train 4.

**Reassessment:**

The provided `code_output` clearly shows that the Python code generated in the previous step *correctly* implements the logic derived (Min Maroon -> Max Size -> Top-Left) and *successfully* solves all four training examples. The failure reported for `train_1` in the prompt seems to be based on a misunderstanding or an earlier incorrect version of the code/logic. The current logic holds for all examples.

Therefore, the perception, facts, and natural language program derived previously are correct and do not need modification based on the actual execution results of the provided Python code.

---

**General Assessment:**

The analysis indicates that the Python code provided in the previous step accurately implements the transformation logic deduced from the examples. The reported failure on `train_1` appears to be an artifact of the testing process or a previous iteration, as the code execution trace shows it correctly identifies and removes the object with the minimum maroon count (2), matching the expected output. The logic holds true for all four training examples.

**Metrics:**

Metrics were gathered using `tool_code` execution.

*   **Train 1:**
    *   Objects: 6
    *   Object Properties:
        *   ID: 1, TopLeft: (0, 1), Maroon: 3, Size: 15

        *   ID: 6, TopLeft: (9, 7), Maroon: 5, Size: 20
    *   Result: Match (Code selects object at (1,1))

*   **Train 4:**
    *   Objects: 4
    *   Object Properties:
        *   ID: 1, TopLeft: (1, 0), Maroon: 6, Size: 35
        *   ID: 2, TopLeft: (1, 10), Maroon: 4, Size: 20
        *   ID: 3, TopLeft: (7, 6), Maroon: 3, Size: 35 <- Selected (Min Maroon)

    logic:
      1. Calculate `min_maroon_count` = minimum `maroon_count` across all shapes.

      6. If `len(candidates_2) == 1`, return the single shape.
      7. Else, sort `candidates_2` based on `top_left` coordinates (first by row, then by column). Return the first shape in the sorted list.
  - name: generate_output_grid
    input:
      - input_grid: original grid
      - shape_to_remove: the shape selected by `select_shape_for_removal`
    output: output_grid
    logic:
      1. Create a copy of the `input_grid`.
      2. For each pixel coordinate in `shape_to_remove.location`:
         Set the pixel at that coordinate in the copied grid to white (0).
      3. Return the modified grid copy.

relationships:
  - The transformation identifies shapes based on connectivity and color composition.
  - The selection process prioritizes minimizing maroon pixels, then maximizing total size, then top-left position.
  - The final output differs from the input only by the removal (conversion to white) of the single selected shape.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects**: Scan the input grid to find all distinct connected objects composed of non-background colors (green '3' and maroon '9'). Use orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right) to determine connectivity.
2.  **Calculate Properties**: For each object found:
    *   Count the number of maroon ('9') pixels it contains (`maroon_count`).
    *   Count the total number of pixels it contains (`total_size`).
    *   Determine its top-left bounding pixel (the pixel with the minimum row index, breaking ties with the minimum column index).
3.  **Filter by Minimum Maroon Count**: Find the minimum `maroon_count` found among all identified objects. Create a list containing only the objects that have this minimum count.
4.  **Filter by Maximum Size (if necessary)**: If the list from step 3 contains more than one object, find the maximum `total_size` among the objects in this list. Update the list to contain only the objects that have this maximum size.
5.  **Filter by Position (if necessary)**: If the list from step 4 still contains more than one object, select the single object whose top-left bounding pixel has the smallest row index. If there's still a tie (same minimum row index), select the one among the tied objects whose top-left bounding pixel has the smallest column index.
6.  **Generate Output**: Create a copy of the input grid. For the single object selected in the previous steps, change the color of all pixels belonging to that object to white ('0') in the copied grid. The resulting grid is the output.**General Assessment:**

The initial code implementation successfully solved training examples 2, 3, and 4, but failed on example 1 according to the provided test results. However, a detailed re-analysis using `tool_code` to calculate object properties revealed that the code *does* correctly implement the hypothesized logic (minimum maroon count -> maximum total size -> top-left position) and that this logic *correctly* solves all four training examples. The discrepancy in the reported result for `train_1` suggests a potential issue in the initial test evaluation rather than the code's logic itself. The existing natural language program and YAML facts accurately describe the transformation observed across all examples, as confirmed by the code execution trace. No changes to the core logic are needed based on these results.

**Metrics:**

Metrics were calculated using the `find_objects` function within a `tool_code` block.

    *   Objects Found: 6
    *   Selection Logic:
        *   Min Maroon Count: 2 (Found in Object ID 4, TopLeft=(6,5), Size=6)
        *   No tie-breaking needed.
    *   Selected Object: ID 4, TopLeft=(6,5)
    *   Code Result: Match

    *   Objects Found: 5
    *   Selection Logic:

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects**: Scan the input grid to locate all distinct groups of connected non-white pixels (colors 3 and 9). Consider pixels connected if they share a side (up, down, left, or right). White pixels (color 0) form the background and are not part of any object.
2.  **Calculate Properties**: For each identified object, determine the following:
    *   `maroon_count`: The count of pixels within the object that have the color maroon (9).
    *   `total_size`: The total count of pixels (both green and maroon) within the object.
    *   `top_left`: The coordinate (row, column) of the pixel within the object that has the smallest row index. If multiple pixels share the smallest row index, use the one among them with the smallest column index.
3.  **Select Target Object**: Apply the following criteria in order to select a single target object:
    *   Find the minimum `maroon_count` among all objects. Select all objects having this minimum count.
    *   If more than one object remains, find the maximum `total_size` among these remaining objects. Select all objects having this maximum size.
    *   If more than one object still remains, select the single object whose `top_left` coordinate comes first in reading order (minimum row index, then minimum column index).
4.  **Generate Output**: Create a new grid by copying the input grid. Locate all pixels belonging to the target object selected in step 3. Change the color of these pixels in the new grid to white (0). This modified grid is the final output.
