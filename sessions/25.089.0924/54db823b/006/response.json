            "text": "**Correction based on Code Output:**\n\nMy manual analysis of candidate selection was slightly off due to miscounting or misidentifying top-left pixels. The code execution provides the accurate candidate selection:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Candidate selected (TL: [6,5], Maroon: 2, Size: 6). 6 > 10 is False. Not removed. **Matches expected output.**\n*   **Example 2:** Candidate selected (TL: [1,6], Maroon: 1, Size: 25). 25 > 10 is True. Removed. **Matches expected output.**\n*   **Example 3:** Candidate selected (TL: [1,1], Maroon: 2, Size: 15). 15 > 10 is True. Removed. **Matches expected output.**\n*   **Example 4:** Candidate selected (TL: [7,6], Maroon: 3, Size: 35). 35 > 10 is True. Removed. **Matches expected output.**\n\nThe hypothesis holds with the threshold `total_size > 10`.\n\nFinal check on Example 1 failure reason: The previous code failed because it *did not* have the size threshold check. It selected the candidate (TL: [6,5], Size: 6) and proceeded to remove it, resulting in an output different from the expected one (which was identical to the input).\n\nNow, construct the final report.**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core logic for selecting a *candidate* object based on minimum maroon count, maximum total size, and top-left position. However, the failure on Example 1 indicated that selection does not automatically guarantee removal.\n\nThe results show that Examples 2, 3, and 4 were processed correctly by the previous code because the selected candidate object happened to be large enough to be removed. Example 1 failed because the candidate object selected by the criteria (minimum maroon, max size, top-left) was too small, and the expected transformation was to *not* remove it.\n\nThe strategy is to introduce a size threshold. A candidate object is selected using the established hierarchical criteria, but it is only removed (pixels changed to white) if its `total_size` exceeds a specific threshold. Based on the analysis, a threshold of `total_size > 10` correctly explains all training examples.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using code execution to analyze the selection process and the application of the size threshold (assumed to be 10) for each training example:\n"

Use orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right) to determine connectivity. If no objects are found, proceed directly to step 7.\n2.  **Calculate Properties**: For each object found:\n    *   Count the number of maroon ('9') pixels it contains (`maroon_count`).\n    *   Count the total number of pixels it contains (`total_size`).\n    *   Determine its top-left bounding pixel (the pixel with the minimum row index, breaking ties with the minimum column index).\n3.  **Select Candidate Object**:\n    *   Find the minimum `maroon_count` among all identified objects.\n    *   Create a list containing only the objects that have this minimum `maroon_count`.\n    *   If this list contains only one object, it is the candidate object.

If there's still a tie (same minimum row index), select the one among the tied objects whose top-left bounding pixel has the smallest column index. This is the candidate object.\n4.  **Check Size Threshold**: Compare the `total_size` of the selected candidate object to a fixed threshold of 10.\n5.  **Determine Action**: If the candidate object's `total_size` is greater than 10, mark it for removal. Otherwise, mark it to be kept (no removal).\n6.  **Generate Output**: Create a copy of the input grid. If an object was marked for removal in step 5, change the color of every pixel belonging to that object to white ('0') in the copied grid. Otherwise, make no changes to the copied grid.\n7.  **Finalize**: The grid resulting from step 6 is the final output."
