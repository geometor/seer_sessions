*   **Assessment:** The initial code correctly identified the core concept of mapping input pixels to output blocks within a structured grid (26x26 with border and gaps). It also correctly calculated the uniform `block_height` based on the number of active input rows. However, it incorrectly assumed a uniform `block_width` calculated similarly based on the number of active input columns. The failed examples (1, 2, 3) demonstrate that the width of output blocks is not uniform. Specifically, blocks in the same output row can merge horizontally if they originate from pixels in the same input row, are adjacent in the *output block grid layout*, and share the same color. The successful example (4) had only one active column, making the uniform width calculation coincidentally correct.

*   **Strategy:**
    1.  Retain the calculation for `block_height`.
    2.  Retain the calculation for the *base* `block_width` (the width of a single, unmerged block).
    3.  Modify the rendering logic: Instead of processing each input pixel individually to draw a block, process the input grid row by row.
    4.  For each active input row:
        *   Identify the non-white pixels, their colors, and their corresponding output block column indices (`j`).
        *   Group consecutive `j` indices that share the same color.
        *   For each group (including groups of one), calculate the merged block's width (sum of base widths and gaps between merged blocks) and its starting column (based on the first `j` in the group).
        *   Draw the potentially merged block with the correct color, height, width, and position.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**

    Let's analyze Example 1 to confirm the merging hypothesis.
