            "text": "*   **Perception:** The task transforms a small input grid containing sparsely placed colored pixels into a much larger, fixed-size output grid (26x26). The input grid acts as a blueprint or map. Each non-white pixel in the input corresponds to a solid-colored rectangular block in the output. The relative positions of these blocks in the output grid mirror the relative positions of the source pixels in the input grid. The output grid has a consistent 2-pixel white border. The central 22x22 area of the output is divided into a grid of colored blocks separated by 2-pixel wide white gaps (both horizontally and vertically). The size of each colored block depends on the number of input rows and columns that contain non-white pixels. Specifically, the total height (or width) of the blocks plus the gaps sums to 22 pixels.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Scan the input grid to find all row indices that contain at least one non-white pixel. Store these unique row indices in a sorted list called `active_rows`. Let `N_rows` be the number of elements in `active_rows`.\n    3.  Scan the input grid to find all column indices that contain at least one non-white pixel. Store these unique column indices in a sorted list called `active_cols`. Let `N_cols` be the number of elements in `active_cols`.\n    4.  Calculate the height of the output blocks: `block_height = (22 - (N_rows - 1) * 2) / N_rows`.\n    5.  Calculate the width of the output blocks: `block_width = (22 - (N_cols - 1) * 2) / N_cols`.\n    6.  Define the gap size between blocks: `gap_size = 2`.\n    7.  Define the border offset: `offset = 2`.\n    8.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` in the input grid.\n    9.  If the color `clr` of the input pixel `input[r, c]` is not white (0):\n        a.
