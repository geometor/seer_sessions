            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial code correctly identified the core concept of filling background pixels adjacent to non-background pixels within a bounding box defined by those non-background pixels. However, the analysis of the failed examples reveals that the filling process is likely iterative or requires a different adjacency check. The code currently performs a single pass, checking adjacency only against the *original* input grid. This prevents the \"growth\" or \"spread\" of the fill color where newly filled pixels should trigger further filling in subsequent steps. The discrepancies in all three examples show under-filling compared to the expected outputs, strongly suggesting that the fill needs to propagate. The strategy is to modify the transformation to perform this propagation, likely by iterating the fill process until no more pixels change color within the bounding box for each non-background color.\n\n*   **Metrics Gathering:**\n    Let's compare the expected and transformed outputs for Example 1 to pinpoint the differences.\n"
