"""
Transforms the input grid by iteratively filling background pixels within the 
bounding box of each non-background color. A background pixel is filled if 
it resides within the specific color's bounding box (calculated from the initial 
pixel positions) and is adjacent (including diagonally, 8-way) to at least one pixel 
of that color (either original or newly filled in a previous iteration for that same color). 
This filling process repeats for each color until no more background pixels can be filled 
within their respective bounding boxes for that color.
The background color is the most frequent color in the input grid.
