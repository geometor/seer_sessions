"""
Transforms the input grid by filling specific background pixels. 
For each non-background color C present in the input:
1. Determine the bounding box enclosing all pixels of color C.
2. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) within this bounding box.
3. If the pixel (r, c) in the *input* grid has the background color AND 
   at least one of its 8 neighbors in the *input* grid has color C, 
   then change the color of pixel (r, c) in the output grid to C.
The background color is the most frequent color in the input grid.
All other pixels retain their original color from the input.
