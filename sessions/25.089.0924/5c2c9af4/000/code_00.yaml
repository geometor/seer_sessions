# Objects identified in the output
output_objects:
  - object: Original Pixels
    description: The non-white pixels from the input remain unchanged.
    properties:
      color: Same as input Scattered Pixels
      positions: Same as input Scattered Pixels
  - object: Concentric Frames
    description: Rectangular frames drawn around the Bounding Box region.
    properties:
      color: Same as input Scattered Pixels
      shape: Rectangular borders
      spacing: Frames correspond to bounding boxes expanded by k=2, 4, 6, ... pixels.
      clipping: Frames stop at grid boundaries.
