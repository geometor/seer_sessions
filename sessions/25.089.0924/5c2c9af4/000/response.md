Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grid is primarily composed of the background color white (0). Scattered within the grid are a small number of pixels (typically 3) of a single non-white color (red=2, azure=8, or green=3 in the examples).
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid retains the original non-white pixels from the input. Additionally, a pattern of concentric rectangular frames, made of the same non-white color, is drawn.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying the spatial extent of the initial non-white pixels and using that to generate expanding frames.
4.  **Bounding Box:** The frames appear centered around the bounding box of the initial non-white pixels.
5.  **Frame Spacing:** The frames are not immediately adjacent. There seems to be a consistent gap between them. Observing the examples, the frames appear at distances 2, 4, 6, ... pixels outwards from the initial bounding box.
6.  **Color Preservation:** The color used for the frames is the same as the color of the non-white pixels found in the input.
7.  **Grid Boundaries:** The frames expand outwards and are clipped by the boundaries of the grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid to find all pixels that are not the background color (white, 0).
2.  If no non-white pixels are found, return the input grid unchanged.
3.  Identify the single color (`C`) used by these non-white pixels.
4.  Determine the minimum bounding box enclosing all pixels of color `C`. Record its minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`).
5.  Create the output grid, initially making it an identical copy of the input grid.
6.  Initialize an expansion distance `k = 2`.
7.  Loop while the expanded frame potentially overlaps the grid:
    a.  Calculate the coordinates of the expanded bounding box for the current `k`:
        *   `top_row = min_r - k`
        *   `left_col = min_c - k`
        *   `bottom_row = max_r + k`
        *   `right_col = max_c + k`
    b.  If `bottom_row < 0` OR `right_col < 0` OR `top_row >= grid_height` OR `left_col >= grid_width`, then the expanded box is entirely outside the grid; stop the loop.
    c.  Draw the border of this expanded box onto the output grid using color `C`. For each pixel position `(r, c)` on the border (top, bottom, left, right edges): if `r` is within `[0, grid_height - 1]` and `c` is within `[0, grid_width - 1]`, set `output_grid[r, c] = C`.
    d.  Increment the expansion distance `k` by 2.
8.  Return the final output grid.
