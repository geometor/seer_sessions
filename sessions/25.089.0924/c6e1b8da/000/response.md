**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input is a 2D grid containing multiple distinct "objects". Each object is a contiguous region of pixels sharing the same non-white color (colors 1 through 9). The background is white (color 0).
2.  **Output Structure:** The output is also a 2D grid of the same dimensions as the input. It retains the same background color. The objects from the input grid are present but potentially modified.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves resolving conflicts at the boundaries where pixels of different non-white colors are adjacent (sharing an edge or a corner).
4.  **Boundary Interaction:** When a pixel of color `C1` is adjacent (including diagonally) to a pixel of a different non-white color `C2`, one of them might change.
5.  **Observed Pattern:** Through comparing the input and output grids across the examples, a consistent pattern emerges: the pixel with the *higher* color index value is changed to white (0), while the pixel with the *lower* color index value remains unchanged. This acts like an "erosion" process where lower-indexed colors erode adjacent higher-indexed colors.
6.  **Scope:** This rule applies only to interactions between different non-white colors. Pixels adjacent only to the background (white) or pixels of the same color are unaffected.
