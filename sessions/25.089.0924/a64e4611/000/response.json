The output grids introduce green (3) while retaining the original white and primary colors in specific locations.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation involves identifying a specific vertical region (a set of columns) in the input grid and changing the color of all pixels within that region to green (3) in the output grid. Pixels outside this region remain unchanged.\n4.  **Region Identification:** The vertical region selected for transformation appears to be the widest contiguous block of columns where *all* pixels in those columns are white (0) in the input grid.\n5.  **Modification Rule:** Once the widest contiguous block of all-white columns is found, every pixel within those columns (from top to bottom row) is changed to green (3) in the output, regardless of its original color (though in the identified columns, the original color is always white by definition).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify all columns that consist entirely of white (0) pixels.\n3.  From the set of identified all-white columns, find the sequence of contiguous columns that has the greatest width (i.e., the maximum number of adjacent all-white columns). If there are multiple sequences with the same maximum width, any one of them can be chosen (the examples suggest there is only one).\n4.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n5.  For every column index within the widest contiguous sequence found in step 3, change the color of all pixels in that column (from the top row to the bottom row) to green (3) in the output grid.\n6.
