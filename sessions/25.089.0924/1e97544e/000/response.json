This sequence typically increments by 1 (wrapping from L back to 1) when moving one step to the right or one step down. However, there might be inconsistencies or deviations from a perfectly uniform pattern in the initially non-zero areas.\n3.  **White Holes:** The input grid contains contiguous areas of white pixels (value 0). These act like \"holes\" or missing data within the background pattern.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The task is to fill these white holes in the input grid while preserving the original non-zero pixels.\n5.  **Filling Mechanism:** The value used to fill a white pixel is determined by its immediate non-white neighbors, following the local progression of the sequence (1 to L). Specifically, it seems to propagate the sequence primarily from the left, and secondarily from above.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
