task_elements:
  - input_grid: A 2D array of integers (colors), including 0 (white).
  - output_grid: A 2D array of integers, same dimensions as input, with 0s replaced.
  - sequence_pattern: A numerical sequence from 1 to L (where L is the max value in the input).
  - white_pixels: Pixels with value 0 in the input_grid, often forming contiguous blocks.
  - non_white_pixels: Pixels with values from 1 to L in the input_grid.
properties:
  - sequence_length (L): Determined by the maximum non-zero value in the input_grid.
  - value_propagation: The rule to determine the value of a previously white pixel based on its neighbors. The value seems to be `(neighbor_value % L) + 1`.
  - invariance: Non-white pixels in the input_grid retain their original values in the output_grid.
actions:
  - copy_grid: Initialize the output_grid as a copy of the input_grid.
  - find_max_value: Scan the input_grid to determine L.
  - iterative_fill: Repeatedly scan the grid, filling white pixels based on non-white neighbors until no more changes occur.
relationships:
  - neighbor_dependency: The value assigned to a white pixel depends on the value(s) of its already determined non-white neighbor(s).
  - fill_priority: The filling logic prioritizes neighbors in a specific order (e.g., Left, then Up).
  - convergence: The iterative filling process stops when a full pass over the grid results in no changes to white pixels.
