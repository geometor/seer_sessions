Orange acts as the background color, filling almost the entire grid. Red pixels form a distinct object.\n3.  **Input Object:** In each input grid, there is a single object composed of red pixels. This object consistently forms a contiguous diagonal line segment where each step moves one cell down and one cell left (slope of -1 relative to image coordinates, or +1 if considering (row, col)).\n4.  **Output Object:** The output grid also contains a single red object, which is also a diagonal line segment with the same down-left orientation. The background remains orange.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves modifying the red object. Comparing input and output objects:\n    *   The length of the red diagonal line segment increases by exactly one pixel in the output compared to the input.\n    *   The position of the line segment changes. Specifically, the \"top-right\" pixel (the one with the lowest row index and highest column index) of the segment shifts. Let the input segment's length be `L` and its top-right pixel be at `(r, c)`. The output segment's top-right pixel appears at `(r - (L+1), c + (L+1))`. The output segment has length `L+1`.\n6.  **Consistency:** This pattern of movement (relative to input length) and growth (length + 1) holds across all three training examples. The background orange color is unchanged, and no other colors appear.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

This group forms a diagonal line segment sloping down and to the left.\n2.  Count the number of red pixels to determine the length of the input segment, `L_in`.\n3.  Find the coordinates `(r_in, c_in)` of the red pixel that is highest (minimum row index) and rightmost (maximum column index) within the segment. This is the \"top-right\" pixel of the segment.\n4.  Calculate a displacement value `k` by adding 1 to the input segment length: `k = L_in + 1`.\n5.  Determine the starting \"top-right\" coordinates `(r_out, c_out)` for the output segment by subtracting `k` from `r_in` and adding `k` to `c_in`: `r_out = r_in - k`, `c_out = c_in + k`.\n6.  Determine the length of the output segment, `L_out`, which is one greater than the input length: `L_out = L_in + 1`.\n7.  Create the output grid, initially filled entirely with the background color, orange (7).\n8.  Draw the output red segment by coloring the pixels starting at `(r_out, c_out)` and extending for `L_out` pixels diagonally down and to the left. Specifically, color the pixels at `(r_out + i, c_out - i)` red (2) for `i` from 0 up to `L_out - 1`."
