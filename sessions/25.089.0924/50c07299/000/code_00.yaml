Grid:
  - Size: 16x16 (consistent across examples)
  - BackgroundColor: Orange (7)

Objects:
  - Type: Single contiguous object per grid
  - Color: Red (2)
  - Shape: Diagonal line segment (slope -1, moving down and left)
  - Properties:
      - Length (number of pixels)
      - Position (defined by the top-right pixel coordinates)

Transformation:
  - Input: Red diagonal segment of length `L_in` with top-right pixel at `(r_in, c_in)`.
  - Output: Red diagonal segment of length `L_out` with top-right pixel at `(r_out, c_out)`.
  - Rule:
      - PositionChangeOffset: `k = L_in + 1`
      - OutputTopRightRow: `r_out = r_in - k`
      - OutputTopRightCol: `c_out = c_in + k`
      - OutputLength: `L_out = L_in + 1`
  - Process:
      1. Identify the red segment in the input.
      2. Calculate its length `L_in` and find its top-right pixel `(r_in, c_in)`.
      3. Calculate the offset `k`.
      4. Determine the output segment's top-right position `(r_out, c_out)` and length `L_out`.
      5. Construct the output grid, starting with the background color (Orange, 7).
      6. Draw the new red segment of length `L_out` starting from `(r_out, c_out)` and extending down-left.
