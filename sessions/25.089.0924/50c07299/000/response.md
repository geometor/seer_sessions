Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 16x16 grid.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors are orange (7) and red (2). Orange acts as the background color, filling almost the entire grid. Red pixels form a distinct object.
3.  **Input Object:** In each input grid, there is a single object composed of red pixels. This object consistently forms a contiguous diagonal line segment where each step moves one cell down and one cell left (slope of -1 relative to image coordinates, or +1 if considering (row, col)).
4.  **Output Object:** The output grid also contains a single red object, which is also a diagonal line segment with the same down-left orientation. The background remains orange.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves modifying the red object. Comparing input and output objects:
    *   The length of the red diagonal line segment increases by exactly one pixel in the output compared to the input.
    *   The position of the line segment changes. Specifically, the "top-right" pixel (the one with the lowest row index and highest column index) of the segment shifts. Let the input segment's length be `L` and its top-right pixel be at `(r, c)`. The output segment's top-right pixel appears at `(r - (L+1), c + (L+1))`. The output segment has length `L+1`.
6.  **Consistency:** This pattern of movement (relative to input length) and growth (length + 1) holds across all three training examples. The background orange color is unchanged, and no other colors appear.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  - Size: 16x16 (consistent across examples)
  - BackgroundColor: Orange (7)

Objects:
  - Type: Single contiguous object per grid
  - Color: Red (2)
  - Shape: Diagonal line segment (slope -1, moving down and left)
  - Properties:
      - Length (number of pixels)
      - Position (defined by the top-right pixel coordinates)

Transformation:
  - Input: Red diagonal segment of length `L_in` with top-right pixel at `(r_in, c_in)`.
  - Output: Red diagonal segment of length `L_out` with top-right pixel at `(r_out, c_out)`.
  - Rule:
      - PositionChangeOffset: `k = L_in + 1`
      - OutputTopRightRow: `r_out = r_in - k`
      - OutputTopRightCol: `c_out = c_in + k`
      - OutputLength: `L_out = L_in + 1`
  - Process:
      1. Identify the red segment in the input.
      2. Calculate its length `L_in` and find its top-right pixel `(r_in, c_in)`.
      3. Calculate the offset `k`.
      4. Determine the output segment's top-right position `(r_out, c_out)` and length `L_out`.
      5. Construct the output grid, starting with the background color (Orange, 7).
      6. Draw the new red segment of length `L_out` starting from `(r_out, c_out)` and extending down-left.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the connected group of red (2) pixels in the input grid. This group forms a diagonal line segment sloping down and to the left.
2.  Count the number of red pixels to determine the length of the input segment, `L_in`.
3.  Find the coordinates `(r_in, c_in)` of the red pixel that is highest (minimum row index) and rightmost (maximum column index) within the segment. This is the "top-right" pixel of the segment.
4.  Calculate a displacement value `k` by adding 1 to the input segment length: `k = L_in + 1`.
5.  Determine the starting "top-right" coordinates `(r_out, c_out)` for the output segment by subtracting `k` from `r_in` and adding `k` to `c_in`: `r_out = r_in - k`, `c_out = c_in + k`.
6.  Determine the length of the output segment, `L_out`, which is one greater than the input length: `L_out = L_in + 1`.
7.  Create the output grid, initially filled entirely with the background color, orange (7).
8.  Draw the output red segment by coloring the pixels starting at `(r_out, c_out)` and extending for `L_out` pixels diagonally down and to the left. Specifically, color the pixels at `(r_out + i, c_out - i)` red (2) for `i` from 0 up to `L_out - 1`.
