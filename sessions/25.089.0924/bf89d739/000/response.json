The output grids contain white (0), red (2), and green (3) pixels.\n2.  **Red Pixels:** The red pixels in the input appear as isolated points. Their positions are preserved exactly in the output grid.\n3.  **Green Pixels:** Green pixels appear only in the output grid. They form paths or networks connecting the locations of the red pixels.\n4.  **Path Structure:** The green paths consist only of horizontal and vertical segments (no diagonals). They seem to form connections *between* the red points.\n5.  **Connectivity:** In all examples, the green paths, together with the red points, form a single connected component. It appears all red points are linked together by the green network.\n6.  **Minimality:** The green network seems to use a minimal amount of path length to connect all the red points, following the grid lines (Manhattan distance). This structure resembles a Rectilinear Steiner Minimal Tree (RSMT), where the red pixels are the terminals to be connected. The paths may involve creating new junction points (Steiner points) where horizontal and vertical segments meet.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
