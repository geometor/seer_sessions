Some objects are single-colored, while others are composed of two different non-white colors.\n    *   The transformation only affects objects composed of exactly two different non-white colors. Single-color objects remain unchanged.\n    *   Within a two-colored object, one color acts as an \"expander\" and the other as a \"target\" or \"center\".\n    *   The transformation rule appears to be based on the relative numerical value (color index) of the two adjacent colors within an object. The color with the higher index value expands.\n    *   The expansion fills the 3x3 area centered on each pixel of the target (lower index) color. Specifically, any white (0) pixel within this 3x3 area is changed to the expander (higher index) color.\n    *   The original pixels of both the expander and target colors remain unchanged.\n    *   The expansion happens simultaneously for all target pixels associated with a given expander color within an object.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
