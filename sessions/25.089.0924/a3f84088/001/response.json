Fill this enclosed area with concentric layers of colors, starting from the layer adjacent to the gray frame and moving inwards.\n3. The fill colors follow a repeating sequence: Red (2), Gray (5), White (0), Gray (5).\n4. The original gray frame and any pixels outside the enclosed area remain unchanged.\n\nProcess:\n1. Copy the input grid to create the output grid.\n2. Find all white pixels (0) in the input grid.\n3. Perform a flood fill starting from all white pixels located on the border of the grid. Mark all reachable white pixels as 'exterior'.\n4. The set of white pixels not marked as 'exterior' constitutes the 'enclosed white pixels'. If this set is empty, return the copied grid.\n5. Identify the coordinates of all gray pixels (5) in the input grid; these form the initial boundary for the filling process.\n6. Initialize a set `pixels_to_fill` with the coordinates of the enclosed white pixels.\n7. Initialize `current_boundary` with the coordinates of the gray frame pixels.\n8. Define the fill color sequence: `fill_colors = [2, 5, 0, 5]`.\n9. Initialize a layer index `layer_index = 0`.\n10. While `pixels_to_fill` is not empty:\n    a. Get the color for the current layer: `current_color = fill_colors[layer_index % len(fill_colors)]`.\n    b. Find all pixels in `pixels_to_fill` that are adjacent (up, down, left, right) to any pixel in `current_boundary`. Store these in `pixels_for_this_layer`.\n    c. If `pixels_for_this_layer` is empty, break the loop (filling is complete or no more reachable pixels).\n    d. For each pixel coordinate `(r, c)` in `pixels_for_this_layer`:\n        i. Set `output_grid[r, c] = current_color`.\n    e. Remove the coordinates in `pixels_for_this_layer` from `pixels_to_fill`.\n    f. Update `current_boundary` to be `pixels_for_this_layer`.\n    g. Increment `layer_index`.\n11. Return the modified `output_grid`.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_enclosed_white_pixels(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies white pixels (0) enclosed within boundaries (non-zero pixels).\n\n    Performs a flood fill starting from border white pixels to find all\n    white pixels connected to the outside.
