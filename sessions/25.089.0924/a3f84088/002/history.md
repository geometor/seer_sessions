Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain a primary object: a closed frame or boundary made of gray pixels (color 5). This frame encloses a contiguous area of white pixels (color 0). The rest of the grid is typically white (color 0), acting as a background.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids maintain the original dimensions and the gray frame from the input. The key transformation occurs within the area originally enclosed by the gray frame.
3.  **Transformation:** The white area inside the gray frame is filled with a pattern of colors, creating nested layers. The filling proceeds inwards from the initial gray frame.
4.  **Color Pattern:** The filling uses a specific, repeating sequence of colors for successive layers moving inwards: Red (2), Gray (5), White (0), Gray (5). This sequence (R, G, W, G) repeats as needed until the enclosed area is completely filled.
5.  **Process:** The transformation seems to involve identifying the boundary (the initial gray frame) and then iteratively identifying the white pixels adjacent to the current boundary, coloring them according to the R, G, W, G sequence, and updating the boundary for the next iteration.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Fill enclosed area with nested layers

Objects:
  - Input Grid:
      - Gray Frame: A contiguous object of gray (5) pixels.
      - Enclosed Area: A contiguous area of white (0) pixels completely surrounded by the Gray Frame.
      - Background: Other pixels, typically white (0).
  - Output Grid:
      - Gray Frame: Same as input.
      - Filled Area: The original Enclosed Area, now filled with nested layers.
      - Layer 1: Red (2) pixels, immediately inside the Gray Frame.
      - Layer 2: Gray (5) pixels, immediately inside Layer 1.
      - Layer 3: White (0) pixels, immediately inside Layer 2.
      - Layer 4: Gray (5) pixels, immediately inside Layer 3.
      - Subsequent Layers: Repeat the pattern Red(2), Gray(5), White(0), Gray(5) inwards.
      - Background: Same as input.

Properties:
  - Grid Size: Unchanged between input and output.
  - Gray Frame: Preserved in the output.
  - Background: Preserved in the output.
  - Fill Colors: Red (2), Gray (5), White (0).
  - Fill Pattern: Layered, repeating sequence R(2)-G(5)-W(0)-G(5).

Relationships:
  - Containment: The Gray Frame encloses the Enclosed Area.
  - Adjacency: Determines the layers. A pixel belongs to the next layer if it's white (0) in the input and adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a pixel belonging to the previous layer boundary.
  - Nesting: Layers are nested concentrically inwards from the Gray Frame.

Actions:
  1. Identify: Locate the Gray Frame and the Enclosed Area within it.
  2. Initialize: Copy the input grid to create the output grid. Define the initial boundary as the set of coordinates of the Gray Frame pixels. Define the fill color sequence [Red(2), Gray(5), White(0), Gray(5)].
  3. Iterate: While there are white pixels in the Enclosed Area adjacent to the current boundary:
     a. Select Color: Get the next color from the repeating sequence.
     b. Find Layer Pixels: Identify all white pixels within the original Enclosed Area that are adjacent (4-connectivity) to any pixel in the current boundary set.
     c. Color Pixels: Change the color of the identified Layer Pixels in the output grid to the selected color.
     d. Update Boundary: Add the coordinates of the newly colored Layer Pixels to the boundary set for the next iteration.
     e. Check Completion: If no white pixels were found adjacent to the boundary in step 3b, stop.
  4. Finalize: Return the modified output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid; this will be the output grid.
2.  Identify the set of all white (0) pixels in the input grid that are part of the contiguous area enclosed by the main gray (5) frame. Let this set be `Enclosed_White_Pixels`.
3.  Identify the set of coordinates of the gray (5) pixels forming the frame that directly borders the `Enclosed_White_Pixels`. Let this set be the initial `Current_Boundary`.
4.  Initialize a layer counter `layer_index` to 0.
5.  Define the fill color sequence: `fill_colors = [Red(2), Gray(5), White(0), Gray(5)]`.
6.  Start a loop that continues as long as `Enclosed_White_Pixels` is not empty:
    a.  Determine the color for the current layer: `current_color = fill_colors[layer_index % length(fill_colors)]`.
    b.  Find all pixels in `Enclosed_White_Pixels` that are adjacent (sharing an edge, not just a corner) to any pixel in `Current_Boundary`. Let this set be `New_Layer_Pixels`.
    c.  If `New_Layer_Pixels` is empty, break the loop (the area is filled).
    d.  For each pixel coordinate `(r, c)` in `New_Layer_Pixels`:
        i.  Change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to `current_color`.
    e.  Remove the pixels in `New_Layer_Pixels` from the `Enclosed_White_Pixels` set.
    f.  Update `Current_Boundary` to be the set `New_Layer_Pixels`.
    g.  Increment `layer_index`.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

"""
Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the area of white pixels (0) enclosed by a gray frame (5).
2. Fill this enclosed area with concentric layers of colors, starting from the layer adjacent to the gray frame and moving inwards.
3. The fill colors follow a repeating sequence: Red (2), Gray (5), White (0), Gray (5).
4. The original gray frame and any pixels outside the enclosed area remain unchanged.

Process:
1. Copy the input grid to create the output grid.
2. Find all white pixels (0) in the input grid.
3. Perform a flood fill starting from all white pixels located on the border of the grid. Mark all reachable white pixels as 'exterior'.
4. The set of white pixels not marked as 'exterior' constitutes the 'enclosed white pixels'. If this set is empty, return the copied grid.
5. Identify the coordinates of all gray pixels (5) in the input grid; these form the initial boundary for the filling process.
6. Initialize a set `pixels_to_fill` with the coordinates of the enclosed white pixels.
7. Initialize `current_boundary` with the coordinates of the gray frame pixels.
8. Define the fill color sequence: `fill_colors = [2, 5, 0, 5]`.
9. Initialize a layer index `layer_index = 0`.
10. While `pixels_to_fill` is not empty:
    a. Get the color for the current layer: `current_color = fill_colors[layer_index % len(fill_colors)]`.
    b. Find all pixels in `pixels_to_fill` that are adjacent (up, down, left, right) to any pixel in `current_boundary`. Store these in `pixels_for_this_layer`.
    c. If `pixels_for_this_layer` is empty, break the loop (filling is complete or no more reachable pixels).
    d. For each pixel coordinate `(r, c)` in `pixels_for_this_layer`:
        i. Set `output_grid[r, c] = current_color`.
    e. Remove the coordinates in `pixels_for_this_layer` from `pixels_to_fill`.
    f. Update `current_boundary` to be `pixels_for_this_layer`.
    g. Increment `layer_index`.
11. Return the modified `output_grid`.
