            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain a primary object: a closed frame or boundary made of gray pixels (color 5). This frame encloses a contiguous area of white pixels (color 0). The rest of the grid is typically white (color 0), acting as a background.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids maintain the original dimensions and the gray frame from the input. The key transformation occurs within the area originally enclosed by the gray frame.\n3.  **Transformation:** The white area inside the gray frame is filled with a pattern of colors, creating nested layers. The filling proceeds inwards from the initial gray frame.\n4.  **Color Pattern:** The filling uses a specific, repeating sequence of colors for successive layers moving inwards: Red (2), Gray (5), White (0), Gray (5). This sequence (R, G, W, G) repeats as needed until the enclosed area is completely filled.\n5.  **Process:** The transformation seems to involve identifying the boundary (the initial gray frame) and then iteratively identifying the white pixels adjacent to the current boundary, coloring them according to the R, G, W, G sequence, and updating the boundary for the next iteration.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

A pixel belongs to the next layer if it's white (0) in the input and adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a pixel belonging to the previous layer boundary.\n  - Nesting: Layers are nested concentrically inwards from the Gray Frame.\n\nActions:\n  1. Identify: Locate the Gray Frame and the Enclosed Area within it.\n  2. Initialize: Copy the input grid to create the output grid. Define the initial boundary as the set of coordinates of the Gray Frame pixels. Define the fill color sequence [Red(2), Gray(5), White(0), Gray(5)].\n  3. Iterate: While there are white pixels in the Enclosed Area adjacent to the current boundary:\n     a. Select Color: Get the next color from the repeating sequence.\n     b. Find Layer Pixels: Identify all white pixels within the original Enclosed Area that are adjacent (4-connectivity) to any pixel in the current boundary set.\n     c. Color Pixels: Change the color of the identified Layer Pixels in the output grid to the selected color.\n     d. Update Boundary: Add the coordinates of the newly colored Layer Pixels to the boundary set for the next iteration.\n     e. Check Completion: If no white pixels were found adjacent to the boundary in step 3b, stop.\n  4. Finalize: Return the modified output grid.\n```"

Determine the color for the current layer: `current_color = fill_colors[layer_index % length(fill_colors)]`.\n    b.  Find all pixels in `Enclosed_White_Pixels` that are adjacent (sharing an edge, not just a corner) to any pixel in `Current_Boundary`. Let this set be `New_Layer_Pixels`.\n    c.
