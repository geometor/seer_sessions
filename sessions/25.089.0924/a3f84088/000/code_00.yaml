Task: Fill enclosed area with nested layers

Objects:
  - Input Grid:
      - Gray Frame: A contiguous object of gray (5) pixels.
      - Enclosed Area: A contiguous area of white (0) pixels completely surrounded by the Gray Frame.
      - Background: Other pixels, typically white (0).
  - Output Grid:
      - Gray Frame: Same as input.
      - Filled Area: The original Enclosed Area, now filled with nested layers.
      - Layer 1: Red (2) pixels, immediately inside the Gray Frame.
      - Layer 2: Gray (5) pixels, immediately inside Layer 1.
      - Layer 3: White (0) pixels, immediately inside Layer 2.
      - Layer 4: Gray (5) pixels, immediately inside Layer 3.
      - Subsequent Layers: Repeat the pattern Red(2), Gray(5), White(0), Gray(5) inwards.
      - Background: Same as input.

Properties:
  - Grid Size: Unchanged between input and output.
  - Gray Frame: Preserved in the output.
  - Background: Preserved in the output.
  - Fill Colors: Red (2), Gray (5), White (0).
  - Fill Pattern: Layered, repeating sequence R(2)-G(5)-W(0)-G(5).

Relationships:
  - Containment: The Gray Frame encloses the Enclosed Area.
  - Adjacency: Determines the layers. A pixel belongs to the next layer if it's white (0) in the input and adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a pixel belonging to the previous layer boundary.
  - Nesting: Layers are nested concentrically inwards from the Gray Frame.

Actions:
  1. Identify: Locate the Gray Frame and the Enclosed Area within it.
  2. Initialize: Copy the input grid to create the output grid. Define the initial boundary as the set of coordinates of the Gray Frame pixels. Define the fill color sequence [Red(2), Gray(5), White(0), Gray(5)].
  3. Iterate: While there are white pixels in the Enclosed Area adjacent to the current boundary:
     a. Select Color: Get the next color from the repeating sequence.
     b. Find Layer Pixels: Identify all white pixels within the original Enclosed Area that are adjacent (4-connectivity) to any pixel in the current boundary set.
     c. Color Pixels: Change the color of the identified Layer Pixels in the output grid to the selected color.
     d. Update Boundary: Add the coordinates of the newly colored Layer Pixels to the boundary set for the next iteration.
     e. Check Completion: If no white pixels were found adjacent to the boundary in step 3b, stop.
  4. Finalize: Return the modified output grid.
