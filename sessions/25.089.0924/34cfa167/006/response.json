            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe error message `AttributeError: 'GridObject' object has no attribute 'max_c'` (and similar errors for `min_c`, `max_r`, `min_r`) clearly indicates a naming inconsistency between the `GridObject` class definition (which uses `min_col`, `max_col`, `min_row`, `max_row`) and the `transform` function's usage (which incorrectly used `min_c`, `max_c`, `min_r`, `max_r`).\n\nThe strategy is to correct these attribute names within the `transform` function to align with the `GridObject` class definition. The underlying logic of identifying anchors, extracting patterns based on anchor positions, tiling these patterns, determining frame colors from the pattern regions, and drawing the frame seems correct based on the visual comparison of inputs and outputs. No changes to the core transformation steps are needed, only the correction of attribute names.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics gathering via code execution is not necessary here, as the error is a straightforward attribute naming issue identified during execution, not a logical flaw requiring data analysis. The visual structure and components identified previously (anchors, patterns, frame) remain consistent across both examples.\n\n## Updated Facts\n\n"

Determine the background color by finding the most frequent pixel value in the input grid.\n3.  Identify all contiguous non-background objects and calculate their bounding boxes (`min_row`, `min_col`, `max_row`, `max_col`).\n4.  Select the object whose bounding box top-left corner (`min_row`, `min_col`) is lexicographically smallest as the Top-Left Anchor (TL_Anchor).\n5.  Select the object whose bounding box bottom-right corner (`max_row`, `max_col`) is lexicographically largest as the Bottom-Right Anchor (BR_Anchor).\n6.  Verify that TL_Anchor and BR_Anchor are distinct objects and that they have the same color, same height (`max_row - min_row + 1`), and same width (`max_col - min_col + 1`). If these conditions are not met, return the original input grid.\n7.  Define the Vertical Pattern Region coordinates: Start Row = `TL_Anchor.min_row`, End Row (exclusive) = `TL_Anchor.max_row + 1`, Start Column = `TL_Anchor.max_col + 1`, End Column (exclusive) = `BR_Anchor.min_col`.\n8.  Define the Horizontal Pattern Region coordinates: Start Row = `TL_Anchor.max_row + 1`, End Row (exclusive) = `BR_Anchor.min_row`, Start Column = `TL_Anchor.min_col`, End Column (exclusive) = `TL_Anchor.max_col + 1`.\n9.  Check if both pattern regions have valid dimensions (End Row > Start Row and End Column > Start Column). If not, return the original input grid.\n10. Extract the `Vertical_Pattern` subgrid from the input grid using the calculated Vertical Pattern Region coordinates.\n11. Extract the `Horizontal_Pattern` subgrid from the input grid using the calculated Horizontal Pattern Region coordinates.\n12. Check if the extracted `Vertical_Pattern` and `Horizontal_Pattern` have non-zero dimensions (height > 0 and width > 0). If either is empty, return the original input grid.\n13. Determine the `Vertical_Frame_Color`: Scan the Vertical Pattern Region (defined in step 7) in the input grid (row by row, then column by column) and find the color of the first non-background pixel encountered.\n14. Determine the `Horizontal_Frame_Color`: Scan the Horizontal Pattern Region (defined in step 8) in the input grid (row by row, then column by column) and find the color of the first non-background pixel encountered.\n15. If either `Vertical_Frame_Color` or `Horizontal_Frame_Color` could not be determined (because the respective region contained only background pixels), return the original input grid.\n16. Tile the `Vertical_Pattern` into the output grid: For each column `c` from `vp_c_start` to `vp_c_end - 1`, calculate the source column index in the pattern as `(c - vp_c_start) % Vertical_Pattern.width`. Copy the pixels from this source column of `Vertical_Pattern` into the output grid at column `c` and rows `vp_r_start` to `vp_r_end - 1`.\n17. Tile the `Horizontal_Pattern` into the output grid: For each row `r` from `hp_r_start` to `hp_r_end - 1`, calculate the source row index in the pattern as `(r - hp_r_start) % Horizontal_Pattern.height`. Copy the pixels from this source row of `Horizontal_Pattern` into the output grid at row `r` and columns `hp_c_start` to `hp_c_end - 1`.\n18. Define frame coordinates: `frame_top = TL_Anchor.min_row - 1`, `frame_bottom = BR_Anchor.max_row + 1`, `frame_left = TL_Anchor.min_col - 1`, `frame_right = BR_Anchor.max_col + 1`.\n19. Draw the frame onto the output grid, respecting grid boundaries:\n    *   Fill column `frame_left` from row `frame_top` to `frame_bottom` (inclusive) with `Horizontal_Frame_Color`.\n    *   Fill column `frame_right` from row `frame_top` to `frame_bottom` (inclusive) with `Horizontal_Frame_Color`.\n    *   Fill row `frame_top` from column `frame_left + 1` to `frame_right - 1` (inclusive) with `Vertical_Frame_Color`.\n    *   Fill row `frame_bottom` from column `frame_left + 1` to `frame_right - 1` (inclusive) with `Vertical_Frame_Color`.\n20. Return the modified output grid."
