            "text": "**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe initial code failed because the logic for extracting the `Vertical_Pattern` and `Horizontal_Pattern` was incorrect. It assumed these patterns spanned the entire distance between the Top-Left (TL) and Bottom-Right (BR) anchor objects. The analysis of the expected outputs reveals that the patterns are smaller, repeating units located immediately adjacent (right and below) to the TL anchor. The size of these patterns is determined by scanning rows/columns until a row/column consisting entirely of the background color is encountered. The frame color determination rule (first non-background pixel in the potential pattern *region*) appears correct, but depended on accurate anchor identification. The tiling logic needs to use the correctly sized, smaller patterns.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Refine the object identification to robustly find the TL and BR anchors, ensuring they match in color and shape (bounding box dimensions).\n2.  Implement the new pattern extraction logic based on scanning adjacent rows/columns until a background-only line is found.\n3.  Maintain the frame color derivation logic but apply it to the correctly defined pattern *regions*.\n4.  Update the tiling logic to use the dimensions of the newly extracted patterns.\n5.  Refine the frame drawing logic to ensure correct placement and color assignment based on the derived frame colors.\n\n**Metrics & Assumptions Verification**\n"
