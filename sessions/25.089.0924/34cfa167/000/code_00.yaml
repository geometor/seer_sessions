Data:
  Input: 2D grid of pixels (0-9)
  Output: 2D grid of pixels (0-9)
  Background_Color: The most frequent color in the input grid.

Objects:
  - Type: Anchor
    Designation: TL_Anchor (Top-Left)
    Identification: The non-background object located furthest top-left.
    Properties: Color (Anchor_Color), Shape, Size, Position (top_row, left_col, bottom_row, right_col).
  - Type: Anchor
    Designation: BR_Anchor (Bottom-Right)
    Identification: The non-background object located furthest bottom-right.
    Constraint: Must have the same Anchor_Color and Shape as TL_Anchor.
    Properties: Color (Anchor_Color), Shape, Size, Position (top_row, left_col, bottom_row, right_col).
  - Type: Pattern_Source
    Designation: Vertical_Pattern_Region
    Identification: Rectangular region in the input grid immediately right of TL_Anchor.
    Properties: Shares rows with TL_Anchor, extends from `TL_Anchor.right_col + 1` to `BR_Anchor.left_col - 1`. Contains the Vertical_Pattern.
  - Type: Pattern_Source
    Designation: Horizontal_Pattern_Region
    Identification: Rectangular region in the input grid immediately below TL_Anchor.
    Properties: Shares columns with TL_Anchor, extends from `TL_Anchor.bottom_row + 1` to `BR_Anchor.top_row - 1`. Contains the Horizontal_Pattern.
  - Type: Frame
    Identification: A single-pixel-thick rectangle surrounding the generated structure.
    Properties:
      - Vertical_Frame_Color: Color of the top-leftmost non-background pixel in Vertical_Pattern_Region.
      - Horizontal_Frame_Color: Color of the top-leftmost non-background pixel in Horizontal_Pattern_Region.
      - Top/Bottom segments use Vertical_Frame_Color.
      - Left/Right segments (including corners) use Horizontal_Frame_Color.

Relationships:
  - TL_Anchor and BR_Anchor define the bounds of the primary transformation area.
  - Vertical_Pattern_Region is adjacent (right) to TL_Anchor.
  - Horizontal_Pattern_Region is adjacent (below) to TL_Anchor.

Actions:
  - Identify background color.
  - Find all non-background objects.
  - Identify TL_Anchor and BR_Anchor, verifying color/shape match.
  - Extract Vertical_Pattern from Vertical_Pattern_Region.
  - Extract Horizontal_Pattern from Horizontal_Pattern_Region.
  - Determine Vertical_Frame_Color and Horizontal_Frame_Color.
  - Copy input grid to create initial output grid.
  - Tile Vertical_Pattern horizontally into the output grid between anchors.
  - Tile Horizontal_Pattern vertically into the output grid between anchors.
  - Calculate frame boundaries based on the combined extent of anchors and tiled patterns.
  - Draw the frame onto the output grid using derived colors.
