            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain a background color (white in the first example, yellow in the second) and several small, distinct objects of different colors.\n2.  **Key Objects:** Two objects stand out as \"anchors\": one near the top-left and another near the bottom-right. In both examples, these anchor objects are identical in shape and color (3x3 blue squares in `train_1`, 2x2 blue squares in `train_2`).\n3.  **Pattern Elements:** There are other objects located immediately to the right of the top-left anchor (forming a \"vertical pattern\") and immediately below the top-left anchor (forming a \"horizontal pattern\").\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves using the anchor objects and the associated patterns to generate a larger structure within the grid.\n5.  **Tiling/Repetition:** The vertical pattern (right of the top-left anchor) is tiled horizontally to fill the space between the top-left anchor and the vertical position of the bottom-right anchor. Similarly, the horizontal pattern (below the top-left anchor) is tiled vertically to fill the space between the top-left anchor and the horizontal position of the bottom-right anchor.\n6.  **Framing:** A rectangular frame is drawn around the newly generated structure (composed of the anchors and the tiled patterns).\n7.  **Frame Colors:** The color of the top and bottom segments of the frame is determined by the first non-background color encountered in the vertical pattern (moving right from the top-left anchor). The color of the left and right segments of the frame is determined by the first non-background color encountered in the horizontal pattern (moving down from the top-left anchor). The corners of the frame take the color of the left/right frame segments.\n8.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the original dimensions and background, but the area defined by the anchors is modified by the tiling process, and a new frame is added around this modified area.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the background color by finding the most frequent pixel value in the input grid.\n3.  Find all contiguous objects composed of non-background colors. Record their properties (color, shape, bounding box).\n4.  Identify the object whose top-left corner has the minimum row, then minimum column (TL_Anchor).\n5.  Identify the object whose bottom-right corner has the maximum row, then maximum column (BR_Anchor).\n6.  Verify that TL_Anchor and BR_Anchor have the same color and shape. If not, the pattern doesn't apply.\n7.  Define the Vertical Pattern Region in the input grid: rows = `TL_Anchor.top_row` to `TL_Anchor.bottom_row`, columns = `TL_Anchor.right_col + 1` to `BR_Anchor.left_col - 1`. Extract the subgrid corresponding to this region as the `Vertical_Pattern`.\n8.  Define the Horizontal Pattern Region in the input grid: rows = `TL_Anchor.bottom_row + 1` to `BR_Anchor.top_row - 1`, columns = `TL_Anchor.left_col` to `TL_Anchor.right_col`. Extract the subgrid corresponding to this region as the `Horizontal_Pattern`.\n9.  Determine the Vertical Frame Color: Find the color of the first non-background pixel encountered when scanning the `Vertical_Pattern` region row by row, then column by column.\n10. Determine the Horizontal Frame Color: Find the color of the first non-background pixel encountered when scanning the `Horizontal_Pattern` region row by row, then column by column.\n11. Tile the `Vertical_Pattern` horizontally into the output grid: Iterate through the rows from `TL_Anchor.top_row` to `TL_Anchor.bottom_row`. Within each row, repeatedly copy the corresponding row slice of the `Vertical_Pattern` into the output grid columns starting from `TL_Anchor.right_col + 1`, continuing until reaching `BR_Anchor.left_col`.\n12. Tile the `Horizontal_Pattern` vertically into the output grid: Iterate through the columns from `TL_Anchor.left_col` to `TL_Anchor.right_col`. Within each column, repeatedly copy the corresponding column slice of the `Horizontal_Pattern` into the output grid rows starting from `TL_Anchor.bottom_row + 1`, continuing until reaching `BR_Anchor.top_row`.\n13. Define the frame boundaries:\n    *   `frame_top_row = TL_Anchor.top_row - 1`\n    *   `frame_bottom_row = BR_Anchor.bottom_row + 1`\n    *   `frame_left_c = TL_Anchor.left_col - 1`\n    *   `frame_right_c = BR_Anchor.right_col + 1`\n14. Draw the frame onto the output grid:\n    *   Draw the left frame segment: Fill column `frame_left_c` from row `frame_top_row` to `frame_bottom_row` with `Horizontal_Frame_Color`.\n    *   Draw the right frame segment: Fill column `frame_right_c` from row `frame_top_row` to `frame_bottom_row` with `Horizontal_Frame_Color`.\n    *   Draw the top frame segment: Fill row `frame_top_row` from column `frame_left_c + 1` to `frame_right_c - 1` with `Vertical_Frame_Color`.\n    *   Draw the bottom frame segment: Fill row `frame_bottom_row` from column `frame_left_c + 1` to `frame_right_c - 1` with `Vertical_Frame_Color`.\n15. The modified grid is the final output."
