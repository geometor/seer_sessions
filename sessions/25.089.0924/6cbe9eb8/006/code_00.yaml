elements:
  - element: background_pixels
    description: Pixels considered part of the background noise or pattern, primarily located outside the main frame. Often consists of low-value colors (0, 1, 2, 3 in examples) in a repeating pattern. White (0) is always considered background. The exact set can also include colors found immediately adjacent to the outside of the identified frame.
    properties:
      - low_value_colors (often 0, 1, 2, 3)
      - repetitive_pattern (often)
      - located_outside_frame (primarily)
      - includes_white (0)
      - includes_colors_adjacent_outside_frame
  - element: frame
    description: A hollow, rectangular structure, exactly one pixel thick, made of a single non-background color. It encloses the 'content_pixels'. Identified as the largest valid frame object in the input.
    properties:
      - rectangular_shape
      - hollow
      - thickness_1_pixel
      - single_color
      - non_background_color
      - encloses_content_pixels
      - largest_valid_frame (heuristic)
  - element: content_pixels
    description: Pixels located spatially inside the 'frame'. These include the actual objects of interest and potentially some 'background_pixels' that need filtering.
    properties:
      - located_inside_frame
      - may_include_objects_of_interest
      - may_include_background_pixels

actions:
  - action: identify_candidate_frames
    description: Find all single-colored, non-white, 1-pixel thick, hollow rectangular structures in the input grid based on their own bounding boxes.
  - action: select_main_frame
    description: From the candidates, select the 'best' frame. Heuristic likely involves selecting the largest frame (by area or perimeter). Record its color (`frame_color`) and outer bounding box (`frame_bounds`).
  - action: determine_background_colors
    description: Create a set of background colors consisting of white (0) plus all unique colors found immediately adjacent to the *outside* perimeter defined by `frame_bounds`.
  - action: extract_inner_content
    description: Select the portion of the input grid located strictly inside the `frame_bounds` (i.e., excluding the frame itself).
  - action: filter_background_from_content
    description: Within the extracted inner content, replace any pixel whose color belongs to the determined background color set with white (0).
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create a new grid sized to fit the inner content plus a 1-pixel border. Draw the border using `frame_color`. Place the filtered inner content into the center.

relationships:
  - relationship: containment
    description: The selected 'frame' contains the 'content_pixels'.
  - relationship: adjacency
    description: The 'background_pixels' used for filtering are determined by adjacency to the outside of the selected 'frame'.
  - relationship: filtering
    description: Pixels within the 'content_pixels' are checked against the 'background_colors'. If a match occurs, the pixel is replaced with white (0) in the output; otherwise, it's preserved.
