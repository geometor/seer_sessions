elements:
  - element: background_pattern
    description: A repeating pattern of low-value colors (e.g., white, blue, red, green) covering large areas of the input grid, primarily outside the main frame.
    properties:
      - repetitive
      - composed of low_value_colors (0, 1, 2, 3 in examples)
      - covers area outside the main frame
      - may also appear inside the main frame initially
  - element: frame
    description: A hollow rectangle, one pixel thick, made of a single non-white color. It encloses other objects and potentially some background pattern elements.
    properties:
      - rectangular_shape
      - hollow (interior exists)
      - thickness: 1 pixel
      - single_color (varies: azure, green in examples)
      - non_white
      - encloses_other_elements
  - element: inner_objects
    description: Contiguous shapes or blocks of pixels located spatially inside the 'frame'. Their colors are distinct from the frame color and typically distinct from the background pattern colors.
    properties:
      - located_inside_frame
      - colors_distinct_from_frame
      - colors_often_distinct_from_background (e.g., yellow, gray, magenta, azure)
      - contiguous

actions:
  - action: identify_frame
    description: Find the single-colored, non-white, 1-pixel thick, rectangular frame in the input grid. Determine its color and the bounding box of the area it encloses.
  - action: identify_background_colors
    description: Determine the set of colors present in the input grid region *outside* the identified frame's outer boundary. Include white (0) in this set.
  - action: extract_inner_content
    description: Select the portion of the input grid located strictly inside the identified frame.
  - action: filter_background
    description: Within the extracted inner content, replace any pixel whose color belongs to the identified background_colors set with white (0).
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create a new grid. Set its border (1 pixel thick) to the frame's color. Place the filtered inner content into the center of this new grid.

relationships:
  - relationship: containment
    description: The 'frame' contains the 'inner_objects' and some initial 'background_pattern' elements.
  - relationship: separation
    description: The 'frame' separates the inner content from the outer 'background_pattern'.
  - relationship: color_mapping
    description: Pixels inside the input frame are mapped to the output grid. Background pattern colors become white (0), while other object colors are preserved. The frame color defines the output border color.
