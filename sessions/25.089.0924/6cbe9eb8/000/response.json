            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids are relatively large and contain a mix of elements:\n    *   A repetitive background pattern using low-numbered colors (0, 1, 2, 3). This pattern fills most of the grid.\n    *   A prominent, single-colored, hollow rectangular frame (thickness 1) embedded within the background. The frame color varies between examples (azure 8, green 3).\n    *   Various smaller shapes or \"objects\" made of other distinct colors (yellow 4, gray 5, magenta 6, azure 8) located *inside* the rectangular frame. Some background pattern elements might also exist inside the frame.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is smaller than the input. It consists of:\n    *   A border matching the color of the frame identified in the input.\n    *   An interior region corresponding to the area inside the input frame.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves:\n    *   **Identifying the Frame:** Locating the single-colored rectangular frame in the input.\n    *   **Extracting Content:** Focusing on the region *inside* this frame.\n    *   **Filtering/Cleaning:** Replacing the pixels corresponding to the input's background pattern with white (0) within the extracted region.\n    *   **Preserving Objects:** Keeping the pixels corresponding to the distinct shapes/objects found inside the input frame.\n    *   **Constructing Output:** Building a new grid with the identified frame color as the border and the filtered/preserved content inside.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
