Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids are relatively large and contain a mix of elements:
    *   A repetitive background pattern using low-numbered colors (0, 1, 2, 3). This pattern fills most of the grid.
    *   A prominent, single-colored, hollow rectangular frame (thickness 1) embedded within the background. The frame color varies between examples (azure 8, green 3).
    *   Various smaller shapes or "objects" made of other distinct colors (yellow 4, gray 5, magenta 6, azure 8) located *inside* the rectangular frame. Some background pattern elements might also exist inside the frame.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is smaller than the input. It consists of:
    *   A border matching the color of the frame identified in the input.
    *   An interior region corresponding to the area inside the input frame.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves:
    *   **Identifying the Frame:** Locating the single-colored rectangular frame in the input.
    *   **Extracting Content:** Focusing on the region *inside* this frame.
    *   **Filtering/Cleaning:** Replacing the pixels corresponding to the input's background pattern with white (0) within the extracted region.
    *   **Preserving Objects:** Keeping the pixels corresponding to the distinct shapes/objects found inside the input frame.
    *   **Constructing Output:** Building a new grid with the identified frame color as the border and the filtered/preserved content inside.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - element: background_pattern
    description: A repeating pattern of low-value colors (e.g., white, blue, red, green) covering large areas of the input grid, primarily outside the main frame.
    properties:
      - repetitive
      - composed of low_value_colors (0, 1, 2, 3 in examples)
      - covers area outside the main frame
      - may also appear inside the main frame initially
  - element: frame
    description: A hollow rectangle, one pixel thick, made of a single non-white color. It encloses other objects and potentially some background pattern elements.
    properties:
      - rectangular_shape
      - hollow (interior exists)
      - thickness: 1 pixel
      - single_color (varies: azure, green in examples)
      - non_white
      - encloses_other_elements
  - element: inner_objects
    description: Contiguous shapes or blocks of pixels located spatially inside the 'frame'. Their colors are distinct from the frame color and typically distinct from the background pattern colors.
    properties:
      - located_inside_frame
      - colors_distinct_from_frame
      - colors_often_distinct_from_background (e.g., yellow, gray, magenta, azure)
      - contiguous

actions:
  - action: identify_frame
    description: Find the single-colored, non-white, 1-pixel thick, rectangular frame in the input grid. Determine its color and the bounding box of the area it encloses.
  - action: identify_background_colors
    description: Determine the set of colors present in the input grid region *outside* the identified frame's outer boundary. Include white (0) in this set.
  - action: extract_inner_content
    description: Select the portion of the input grid located strictly inside the identified frame.
  - action: filter_background
    description: Within the extracted inner content, replace any pixel whose color belongs to the identified background_colors set with white (0).
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create a new grid. Set its border (1 pixel thick) to the frame's color. Place the filtered inner content into the center of this new grid.

relationships:
  - relationship: containment
    description: The 'frame' contains the 'inner_objects' and some initial 'background_pattern' elements.
  - relationship: separation
    description: The 'frame' separates the inner content from the outer 'background_pattern'.
  - relationship: color_mapping
    description: Pixels inside the input frame are mapped to the output grid. Background pattern colors become white (0), while other object colors are preserved. The frame color defines the output border color.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Scan** the input grid to locate a rectangular, hollow frame that is exactly one pixel thick and composed of a single, non-white color. Let the color of this frame be `frame_color`. Identify the rectangular region strictly *inside* this frame.
2.  **Identify** the set of all unique pixel colors present in the input grid *outside* the bounding box of the found frame. Add white (0) to this set. Call this set `background_colors`.
3.  **Create** a new output grid whose dimensions are 2 plus the height and 2 plus the width of the inner region identified in step 1.
4.  **Draw** a border, one pixel thick, around the edge of the output grid using the `frame_color`.
5.  **Iterate** through each pixel `(r, c)` within the inner region of the input grid (identified in step 1). Let the color of this input pixel be `P`.
6.  **Determine** the corresponding position `(r_out, c_out)` in the output grid's interior (offset by +1 row, +1 column from the relative position within the inner region).
7.  **Check** if the input pixel color `P` is present in the `background_colors` set (identified in step 2).
8.  **If** `P` is in `background_colors`, set the pixel at `(r_out, c_out)` in the output grid to white (0).
9.  **Else** (if `P` is *not* in `background_colors`), set the pixel at `(r_out, c_out)` in the output grid to `P`.
10. **Output** the completed grid.
