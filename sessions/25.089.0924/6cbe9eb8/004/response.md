    *   The actual count (36) doesn't match the expected perimeter count (42). This is because the azure frame in Ex1 is *not* perfectly rectangular; it has intrusions (pixels `grid[2, 11]`, `grid[9, 11]`, `grid[10, 11]`, `grid[11, 11]` are 8 but *shouldn't* be for a perfect frame). My `find_frame_coords` relied on the perimeter count check, which fails here.
    *   **Conclusion for Ex1:** The frame finding logic is too strict. It needs to correctly identify the main rectangular outline even if there are minor internal 'blemishes' or connected components touching the inside edge. Perhaps find the bounding box first, then check if the border pixels *mostly* form the frame? Or find the largest single-color rectangle?

*   **Example 2 Failure:** `find_frame_coords` returned `None`. Let's check the green (3) frame.
    *   Green coords: `min_r=3, min_c=5`, `max_r=11, max_c=16`. Height=9, Width=12.
    *   Expected perimeter: 2*9 + 2*12 - 4 = 18 + 24 - 4 = 38.
    *   Let's count green pixels:

    *   Again, the perimeter count check fails (33 != 38). The manual check also shows the pixels defined by the bounding box do *not* form a perfect green rectangle (e.g., `grid[3, 14]` is 8, not 3; `grid[6, 16]` is 2, not 3).

The code outputted the expected frame *before* filtering. This suggests the filtering step incorrectly identified yellow (4) as a background color.

background_colors={0, 1, 4}

```
    *   The background colors identified are {0, 1, 4}. Yellow (4) *is* present outside the frame boundary (e.g., `grid[4, 12]` to `grid[6, 14]`). Therefore, the code correctly identified {0, 1, 4} as background colors based on the rule "colors strictly outside the frame".
    *   However, the expected output *preserves* yellow (4) inside the frame. This means the definition of "background color" is wrong. It shouldn't just be colors *outside* the frame.
    *   What distinguishes the *true* background (0, 1, 2, 3) from the *preserved* colors (4, 5, 6, 8)? The background seems to be a simple repeating pattern, often just 2 or 3 colors. The preserved colors form distinct 'objects' inside the frame.
    *   **Revised Background Idea:** The background colors are the set of colors making up the repeating pattern *around* the frame. White (0) should always be treated as background *inside* the frame unless it's part of a specific preserved object (which doesn't seem to be the case here). Perhaps identify the most common colors outside the frame? Or colors directly adjacent to the *outside* of the frame?
    *   Let's try "colors adjacent to the outside of the frame".
        *   Ex1 (Azure frame): Neighbors outside are 0, 1, 2, 3. Background = {0, 1, 2, 3}. Correct.
        *   Ex2 (Green frame): Neighbors outside are 0, 1, 2. Background = {0, 1, 2}. Correct.
        *   Ex3 (Green frame): Neighbors outside are 0, 1. Background = {0, 1}. Correct. This correctly excludes yellow (4).
    *   **Conclusion for Ex3 & General:** The rule for background colors needs refinement. Instead of *all* colors outside, it should be the colors *immediately adjacent* to the outer perimeter of the frame, plus white (0).

**Revised Strategy:**

1.  **Frame Finding:** Need a more robust method.
    *   Find all connected components of each non-black color.
    *   For each component, calculate its bounding box.
    *   Check if the component's pixels match the *perimeter* of its bounding box (allowing for minor imperfections?). A better check might be: calculate the bounding box, find all pixels of that color *on* the bounding box perimeter. Check if these perimeter pixels form a contiguous loop. Check if there are *no* pixels of the same color strictly inside the bounding box. Check if the pixels immediately outside the bounding box perimeter are *not* the frame color (thickness 1). Select the component that best fits these criteria. The largest valid frame is likely the target.
2.  **Background Colors:** Identify colors immediately adjacent to the *outside* of the found frame's perimeter. Add white (0) to this set.
3.  **Filtering:** Apply the filtering using the *new* background color definition.

Let's refine the YAML and NL Program.## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code failed on all three training examples, indicating fundamental issues with either the frame detection, background color identification, or the filtering logic, or a combination thereof.

*   **Example 1 Failure:** Produced an output derived from an incorrect region (likely the inner yellow shape), suggesting the `find_frame_coords` function identified the wrong structure or failed to identify the correct azure frame robustly. The strict perimeter pixel count check was likely the cause, as the azure frame has irregularities.
*   **Example 2 Failure:** Returned the original input, meaning `find_frame_coords` failed entirely. Similar to Example 1, the green frame in this example is not a perfect rectangle according to its bounding box, causing the perimeter and shape checks to fail.
*   **Example 3 Failure:** Correctly identified the frame and output size, but incorrectly filtered the content (removed yellow pixels). This happened because the `get_background_colors` function included *all* colors outside the frame's bounding box, incorrectly classifying the external yellow shape's color as "background" for filtering purposes.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Revise Frame Finding:** Implement a more robust `find_frame_coords` function. Instead of relying on exact perimeter pixel counts, focus on:
    *   Finding the bounding box of each potential frame color.
    *   Verifying that the color predominantly forms the *perimeter* of that bounding box.
    *   Ensuring the frame is hollow (no internal pixels of the same color).
    *   Ensuring the frame is 1-pixel thick (no adjacent pixels of the same color immediately outside the perimeter).
    *   Select the most likely candidate frame (e.g., largest perimeter, most rectangular).
2.  **Revise Background Color Identification:** Change the definition of "background colors". Instead of *all* colors outside the frame, identify only those colors directly *adjacent* to the outside edge of the found frame's perimeter. Always include white (0) in the background set.
3.  **Maintain Filtering Logic:** The core logic of iterating the inner frame area and replacing background colors with white (0) while preserving others remains sound, but will use the revised background color set.

## Metrics and Analysis

**Example 1:**

*   Input Size: 14x22
*   Expected Output Size: 12x11
*   Actual Output Size: 6x7
*   Expected Frame: Azure (8), Outer Bounds approx. r=1..12, c=1..11
*   Code Issue: Failed frame detection due to frame imperfections (pixels at `[2, 11]`, `[9, 11]`, `[10, 11]`, `[11, 11]`) causing perimeter checks to fail.
*   Background Rule Check: Colors adjacent to the *outside* of the true azure frame are {0, 1, 2, 3}. Adding 0 gives {0, 1, 2, 3}. This seems correct.

**Example 2:**

*   Input Size: 13x23
*   Expected Output Size: 9x12
*   Actual Output Size: 13x23 (Input returned)
*   Expected Frame: Green (3), Outer Bounds approx. r=3..11, c=5..16
*   Code Issue: Failed frame detection. The bounding box `r=3..11, c=5..16` contains non-green pixels on its perimeter (e.g., `grid[3, 14]=8`, `grid[6, 16]=2`). Perimeter checks failed.
*   Background Rule Check: Colors adjacent to the *outside* of the true green frame are {0, 1, 2}. Adding 0 gives {0, 1, 2}. This seems correct.

**Example 3:**

*   Input Size: 16x23
*   Expected Output Size: 8x8
*   Actual Output Size: 8x8
*   Expected Frame: Green (3), Outer Bounds r=1..8, c=2..9
*   Code Issue: Background color identification. `get_background_colors` found {0, 1, 4} because yellow (4) exists outside the frame bounds (`r=4..6, c=12..14`). Filtering removed yellow (4) based on this incorrect background set.
*   Background Rule Check: Colors adjacent to the *outside* of the true green frame are {0, 1}. Adding 0 gives {0, 1}. This set correctly excludes yellow (4).
