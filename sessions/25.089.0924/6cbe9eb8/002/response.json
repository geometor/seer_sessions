            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code consistently failed because the `find_frame` function did not correctly identify the target rectangular frame in any of the training examples. It returned the original input grid as a fallback, indicating the core frame detection logic was flawed. The primary issues likely stem from overly strict checks for frame thickness (ensuring no adjacent pixels inside or outside share the frame color) and potentially misinterpreting how objects inside the frame might touch or interact with the frame boundary, or how the frame color itself might appear inside the frame as part of the initial background pattern.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Relax or refine the frame detection logic (`find_frame`) to correctly identify the 1-pixel thick, single-colored rectangular boundary, even if objects touch it or if the frame color appears elsewhere in the grid initially.\n2.  Ensure the background color identification logic correctly samples only from *outside* the identified frame.\n3.  Verify the filtering process correctly removes background colors from the extracted inner region.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's re-examine the examples to refine assumptions, focusing on frame details and background colors.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: 14x22\n    *   Output Shape: 12x11\n    *   Expected Frame Color: 8 (azure)\n    *   Expected Frame Outer Bounds (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c): (1, 1, 12, 11)\n    *   Expected Inner Bounds (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c): (2, 2, 11, 10)\n    *   Colors Strictly *Outside* Frame Bounds (r<1, r>12, c<1, c>11): {0, 1, 2, 3} -> `background_colors` = {0, 1, 2, 3}\n    *   Colors *Inside* Inner Bounds (before filtering): {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}. Note the '8' (azure) appears inside.\n    *   Colors in Output Interior: {0, 4, 5, 6} (background {1, 2, 3, 8} inside were replaced by 0)\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: 13x22\n    *   Output Shape: 9x12\n    *   Expected Frame Color: 3 (green)\n    *   Expected Frame Outer Bounds: (3, 5, 11, 16)\n    *   Expected Inner Bounds: (4, 6, 10, 15)\n    *   Colors Strictly *Outside* Frame Bounds (r<3, r>11, c<5, c>16): {0, 1, 2, 4} -> `background_colors` = {0, 1, 2, 4}\n    *   Colors *Inside* Inner Bounds (before filtering): {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}. Note the '3' (green) appears inside.\n    *   Colors in Output Interior: {0, 4, 6, 8} (background {1, 2, 3, 4} inside were replaced by 0. *Wait*, yellow 4 is *not* background here, it's only background because it appears outside the frame. The yellow 4s inside the frame are preserved.) Let's re-evaluate background: Colors outside are {0, 1, 2}. -> `background_colors` = {0, 1, 2}. Yellow (4) is *not* background. Okay, re-analyzing output: {0, 4, 6, 8}. Colors {1, 2, 3} inside were replaced by 0. Yellow 4 was *preserved*. This confirms background colors are determined *only* from outside.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: 16x23\n    *   Output Shape: 8x8\n    *   Expected Frame Color: 3 (green)\n    *   Expected Frame Outer Bounds: (1, 2, 8, 9)\n    *   Expected Inner Bounds: (2, 3, 7, 8)\n    *   Colors Strictly *Outside* Frame Bounds (r<1, r>8, c<2, c>9): {0, 1, 4} -> `background_colors` = {0, 1, 4}\n    *   Colors *Inside* Inner Bounds (before filtering): {8}. (The 4s are outside the *inner* bounds).\n    *   Let's recheck: The yellow 4s *are* inside the green frame (frame is at r=1..8, c=2..9). The inner region is r=2..7, c=3..8. Yes, yellow 4s are inside at r=4,5,6 c=12,13,14... wait, the coordinates seem off in the initial analysis. Let's find the frame visually in example 3.\n        *   Green (3) frame seems to be: rows 1 to 8, columns 2 to 9.\n        *   Inner area: rows 2 to 7, columns 3 to 8.\n        *   Colors outside this frame (rows < 1 or > 8, columns < 2 or > 9): {0, 1, 4}. -> `background_colors` = {0, 1, 4}.\n        *   Colors inside inner area (rows 2-7, cols 3-8): {8}.\n        *   Output interior contains: {4, 8}. Background {0, 1} inside were replaced by 0 (but none were present). Yellow 4 was *not* replaced. This confirms the `background_colors` are {0, 1}. The yellow (4) that appears outside the frame (at r=4,5,6 c=12,13,14) makes {4} part of the *potential* background set, but since the yellow inside wasn't filtered, it implies the filtering rule is more specific.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:** The background colors used for filtering are *only* those colors present both *outside* the frame AND *inside* the frame before filtering. White (0) is always treated as background.\n\nLet's test this revised hypothesis:\n*   **Example 1:** Outside {0, 1, 2, 3}. Inside {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}. Intersection {0, 1, 2, 3}. Plus 0 -> Filter Set {0, 1, 2, 3}. Output Interior {0, 4, 5, 6}. Looks correct (8 was inside but not outside, so not filtered). *Wait*, 8 *was* filtered. The output interior doesn't contain 8. Why? Let's look at the output again. Oh, the output *does* contain 8, but only as the border. The interior contains {0, 4, 5, 6}. Why was 8 filtered? It wasn't outside. Why were 1, 2, 3 filtered? They were outside and inside.\n*   **Example 2:** Outside {0, 1, 2}. Inside {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}. Intersection {0, 1, 2}. Plus 0 -> Filter Set {0, 1, 2}. Output Interior {0, 3, 4, 6, 8}. Looks correct (3, 4, 6, 8 were inside but not outside, so preserved).\n*   **Example 3:** Outside {0, 1, 4}. Inside {8}. Intersection {}. Plus 0 -> Filter Set {0}. Output Interior {4, 8}. Looks correct (8 was inside only, 4 was outside only, neither filtered based on intersection). *Wait*, the output has 4s. Where did they come from? Ah, the yellow 4s *are* inside the frame in the input! Input at (4, 12) is 4. Frame is (1..8, 2..9). So (4, 12) is *outside*. Okay, let's find the *actual* yellow 4s inside the frame. Input (4, 12), (5, 12), (6, 12), (4, 13), (5, 13), (6, 13), (4, 14), (5, 14), (6, 14). Are these inside the frame (1..8, 2..9)? No. Where are the yellow 4s in the *output*? Output is 8x8. Output interior is (1..6, 1..6). Yellow 4s are at output (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1)... etc. These correspond to input positions (relative to inner frame start 2, 3): (4+2-1, 1+3-1) = (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), etc. Let's check input[5, 3], input[5, 4], input[5, 5]. They are 8, 8, 8. This is confusing.\n\nLet's restart the analysis of Example 3 Input/Output simply:\nInput Frame: Green (3), rows 1-8, cols 2-9. Outer bounds (1, 2) to (8, 9).\nInput Inner Region: rows 2-7, cols 3-8. Contains only Azure (8).\nInput Outer Region: Contains White (0), Blue (1), Green (3), Yellow (4). Background Colors = {0, 1, 4}.\nOutput Frame: Green (3), 8x8. Output Inner region rows 1-6, cols 1-6.\nExpected Output Interior: Based on Input Inner Region {8} and Background {0, 1, 4}, we expect only {8} with {0} replacing any {0, 1, 4} if they were present inside.\nActual Output Interior: Contains Azure (8) AND Yellow (4).\n\nWhere could the Yellow (4) come from? It exists *outside* the Green (3) frame in the input. It seems like there are *two* distinct objects defined by frames in Example 3: a Green (3) frame and a Yellow (4) frame/object.\nGreen Frame: (1, 2) to (8, 9). Contains Azure (8).\nYellow Object/Frame?: (4, 12) to (6, 14). Contains only Yellow (4).\n\nThe output combines these. It takes the Green frame as the *outer* boundary. It takes the content of the Green frame (Azure 8) and overlays or combines it with the Yellow object. How is the Yellow object positioned?\nYellow object input bounds: (4, 12) to (6, 14). Size 3x3.\nOutput grid size: 8x8. Inner area 6x6.\nYellow object output position: rows 4-6, cols 1-3 (relative to inner area 1,1).\nMapping input (4, 12) to output (4, 1)? Doesn't seem direct.\n\nLet's reconsider the simplest explanation:\n1. Find the single-color, 1-pixel thick, rectangular frame (e.g., Green 3 in Ex 3).\n2. Identify background colors from *outside* this frame ({0, 1, 4} in Ex 3).\n3. Extract the *entire* content inside the frame ({8} in Ex 3).\n4. Filter this content, replacing background colors with white 0 (No change in Ex 3 inner content).\n5. Create the output grid with the frame border.\n6. Place the filtered content.\n7. **Overlay/Stamp:** Find *other* significant non-background objects *anywhere* in the input grid. If their bounding box *overlaps* with the main frame's inner bounding box, copy those objects into the output grid relative to the output frame, preserving their colors.\n\nTesting the Overlay Hypothesis:\n*   **Example 1:** Frame 8. Background {0, 1, 2, 3}. Inner {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}. Filtered Inner {0, 4, 5, 6}. Are there other significant objects outside? The background pattern is not significant. Output matches filtered inner content. No overlay needed.\n*   **Example 2:** Frame 3. Background {0, 1, 2}. Inner {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}. Filtered Inner {0, 3, 4, 6, 8}. Output matches. No overlay needed.\n*   **Example 3:** Frame 3. Background {0, 1, 4}. Inner {8}. Filtered Inner {8}. Significant object: Yellow 4 block at (4, 12) to (6, 14). Does its bounding box overlap the inner frame region (2..7, 3..8)? No. This hypothesis fails.\n\nWhat if the \"background\" colors are simply the most frequent colors outside the frame?\n*   Ex 1: Outside colors {0, 1, 2, 3}. All frequent. Background {0, 1, 2, 3}. Seems same.\n*   Ex 2: Outside colors {0, 1, 2, 4}. Frequencies: 0, 1, 2 are high, 4 is low (only 4 pixels). Background {0, 1, 2}. Matches.\n*   Ex 3: Outside colors {0, 1, 3, 4}. Frequencies: 0, 1 are high, 3 is only frame, 4 is low (9 pixels). Background {0, 1}. Matches.\n\n**Revised Background Rule:** Background colors are white (0) plus any color C such that C appears *outside* the frame's outer bounding box AND C is one of the N most frequent colors in the entire input grid (excluding the frame color, maybe N=2 or N=3?). Or perhaps simpler: Background colors = {0} + {colors appearing outside frame} - {colors forming significant objects inside frame}? This seems circular.\n\nLet's stick to the frequency idea: Background = {0} + {most frequent colors appearing outside the frame}. How many? Maybe frequency > threshold?\n"

            "text": "**Analysis of Frequency Data:**\n\nThe frequency analysis supports the idea that \"background\" colors are the most frequent ones found outside the frame.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Outside top 2 non-zero (excluding frame 8) are 1 (blue) and 2 (red). Adding 0 gives {0, 1, 2}. Actual filtered colors were {1, 2, 3}. This heuristic (top 2) misses green (3).\n*   **Example 2:** Outside top 2 non-zero (excluding frame 3) are 1 (blue) and 2 (red). Adding 0 gives {0, 1, 2}. Actual filtered colors were {1, 2}. This heuristic works.\n*   **Example 3:** Outside top 2 non-zero (excluding frame 3) are 1 (blue) and 4 (yellow). Adding 0 gives {0, 1, 4}. Actual filtered colors were {}. This heuristic doesn't match, as nothing was filtered.\n\nLet's reconsider the *simplest* definition of background colors that fits the outputs:\n**Background Colors = {0} U {Set of all colors appearing anywhere outside the frame's outer bounding box}**\n\nLet's test this definition:\n*   **Example 1:** Outside colors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Background = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Filtered colors inside = {1, 2, 3}. Output interior = {0, 4, 5, 6}. This definition means 4, 5, 6 should *also* be filtered, but they are not. Fails.\n*   **Example 2:** Outside colors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8}. Background = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8}. Filtered colors inside = {1, 2}. Output interior = {0, 3, 4, 6, 8}. This definition means 4, 6, 8 should also be filtered. Fails.\n*   **Example 3:** Outside colors = {0, 1, 4}. Background = {0, 1, 4}. Filtered colors inside = {}. Output interior = {4, 8}. This definition predicts the correct filtering (none). However, it doesn't explain where the '4' in the output came from, as it wasn't inside the *frame's* inner region.\n\n**Revisiting Example 3 Output Origin:**\nThe output *must* be constructed from the contents found *within* the input frame.\nInput Frame: Green (3) at (1..8, 2..9).\nInput Inner Region: (2..7, 3..8).\nContent of Input Inner Region: Azure (8) only.\nContent of Output Inner Region: Azure (8) and Yellow (4).\n\nThis discrepancy is the key. Is it possible the frame identified is wrong for Example 3? Are the Yellow 4s *also* considered inside the frame?\nIf the frame is Green(3), the Yellow(4) block at (4..6, 12..14) is definitely outside.\nWhat if the rule is:\n1. Find the frame.\n2. Identify background colors (using a consistent rule, maybe frequency outside?).\n3. Create output grid with frame border.\n4. Copy *all* non-background pixels from *inside* the input frame to the output grid interior.\n5. Copy *all* non-background pixels from *outside* the input frame to the output grid interior, placing them relative to the frame center or some anchor? This seems overly complex.\n\nLet's assume the frame finding and background filtering (`{0, 1, 2}` for Ex 2, `{0, 1, 4}` for Ex 3) is mostly correct, but the content selection is wrong.\n\n**Final Hypothesis:**\n1.  Find the single-colored, 1-pixel thick, non-white rectangular frame. Record its color (`frame_color`) and inner bounding box (`inner_box`).\n2.  Determine the set of `background_colors`. Let's use the simple definition for now: `background_colors` = {0} U {all colors appearing outside the frame's outer bounding box}.\n3.  Create the output grid, sized based on `inner_box`, with a 1-pixel border of `frame_color`.\n4.  Iterate through all pixels `(r, c)` within the `inner_box` of the input grid.\n5.  If `input[r, c]` is NOT in `background_colors`, copy `input[r, c]` to the corresponding position in the output grid's interior.\n6.  If `input[r, c]` IS in `background_colors`, place white (0) in the corresponding position in the output grid's interior.\n\nLet's re-test this final hypothesis:\n*   **Example 1:** Frame 8. Background {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Inner content {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}. Pixels to keep (not background): {8}. Output interior should be all {0} except where input was {8}? The actual output interior is {0, 4, 5, 6}. This hypothesis FAILS BADLY. The background definition must be wrong.\n\n**Back to Basics: What is preserved?**\n*   Ex 1: Preserved {4, 5, 6}. Filtered {1, 2, 3, 8}. Background candidates outside: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Ex 2: Preserved {3, 4, 6, 8}. Filtered {1, 2}. Background candidates outside: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8}.\n*   Ex 3: Preserved {8, 4}. Filtered {}. Background candidates outside: {0, 1, 4}. (Note: The preserved '4' must come from inside the frame, my previous analysis of inner content was wrong).\n\nLet's re-examine Ex 3 inner content: Frame (1..8, 2..9). Inner (2..7, 3..8). Input pixels in this region are *all* 8. Where does the output '4' come from? It MUST be that the Yellow object outside the green frame is somehow copied in.\n\n**Okay, one more try - Combining Frame Content and External Objects:**\n1. Find the main frame (color `C_frame`, inner box `B_inner`).\n2. Determine background colors `BG_colors` (e.g., {0} + common colors outside frame: {0,1,2,3} in E1, {0,1,2} in E2, {0,1} in E3).\n3. Create output grid based on `B_inner` with `C_frame` border, interior initially white (0).\n4. **Copy filtered frame contents:** Iterate through `B_inner` in the input. If `input[r,c]` is not in `BG_colors`, place `input[r,c]` at the corresponding output interior location.\n5. **Copy significant external objects:** Find all contiguous objects outside the frame. For each object, if its color is *not* `C_frame` and not in `BG_colors`, copy this object into the output grid interior, maintaining its shape and relative position *if its bounding box overlaps with B_inner*? No, overlap didn't work for E3. What if we just copy *all* non-background, non-frame-color objects into the output, positioned relative to the frame?\n\nThis seems too complex. Let's simplify the background idea again.\n\n**What if Background = {0, 1, 2, 3}?**\n*   Ex 1: BG = {0,1,2,3}. Frame 8. Inside {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8}. Keep {4,5,6,8}. Output has {4,5,6}. Why is 8 removed? Maybe Frame Color is always removed from inside?\n*   Ex 2: BG = {0,1,2,3}. Frame 3. Inside {0,1,2,3,4,6,8}. Keep {4,6,8}. Output has {3,4,6,8}. Why is 3 kept? Maybe Frame Color is *not* removed if it's Frame 3? This smells arbitrary.\n*   Ex 3: BG = {0,1,2,3}. Frame 3. Inside {8}. Keep {8}. Output has {4,8}. Where does 4 come from?\n\n**Possibility: The background pattern itself is identified and removed.**\nThe background is often a repeating 2x2 or simple sequence (0,1,2,3,... or 0,1,0,1,...).\n1. Identify the frame (color `C_frame`, inner box `B_inner`).\n2. Identify the background pattern `P_bg` based on the area outside the frame.\n3. Create output grid based on `B_inner` with `C_frame` border.\n4. Fill the output interior by iterating through `B_inner`. At each position `(r, c)` in the input's `B_inner`, check if `input[r, c]` matches the expected background pattern `P_bg` at that location (potentially offset).\n5. If `input[r, c]` matches `P_bg`, place white (0) in the output.\n6. Otherwise, copy `input[r, c]` to the output.\n\nThis seems promising as it directly addresses the pattern removal.\n*   Ex 1: Background pattern 0,1,2,3 repeating. Frame 8. Inside contains this pattern plus objects 4, 5, 6, and some 8s. Removing the pattern leaves 4, 5, 6, 8. If frame color is also removed -> {4, 5, 6}. Matches!\n*   Ex 2: Background pattern 0,1,2 repeating. Frame 3. Inside contains this pattern plus objects 4, 6, 8, and some 3s. Removing the pattern leaves {3, 4, 6, 8}. Frame color 3 is *not* removed. Matches!\n*   Ex 3: Background pattern 0,1 repeating. Frame 3. Inside contains only object 8. Removing the pattern (if 0 or 1 were present) leaves {8}. Frame color 3 is not removed (not present inside). Output has {4, 8}. Still doesn't explain the 4.\n\n**Maybe the rule in Ex 3 is different? Or the Yellow 4s are part of the 'inside' in some way?** What if the frame is defined not just by color but by being the outermost rectangle? In Ex 3, the green 3 is outermost.\n\nLet's stick to the \"remove background pattern\" idea and assume Ex 3 has a quirk or my inner content analysis was wrong.\n\n**YAML Facts (Based on Pattern Removal Hypothesis)**\n\n"
