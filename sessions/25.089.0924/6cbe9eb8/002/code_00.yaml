elements:
  - element: background_pattern
    description: A repeating pattern of low-value colors (e.g., 0,1,2,3 or 0,1) covering large areas of the input grid, identified from the region outside the main frame.
    properties:
      - repetitive
      - composed of specific colors (e.g., {0,1,2,3} or {0,1})
      - pattern_unit (e.g., 2x2, 1xN sequence)
      - identified_from_outside_frame
  - element: frame
    description: The outermost, hollow rectangle, one pixel thick, made of a single non-white color. It encloses other objects and potentially some background pattern elements.
    properties:
      - rectangular_shape
      - hollow
      - thickness: 1 pixel
      - single_color (varies: azure, green)
      - non_white
      - outermost_rectangle_of_single_color
      - encloses_other_elements
  - element: inner_objects
    description: Contiguous shapes or blocks of pixels located spatially inside the 'frame' whose color does not match the identified background pattern at that location. Includes the frame color itself in some cases (Ex 2).
    properties:
      - located_inside_frame
      - color_mismatch_with_background_pattern
      - may_include_frame_color

actions:
  - action: identify_frame
    description: Find the outermost, single-colored, non-white, 1-pixel thick, rectangular frame in the input grid. Determine its color and the bounding box of the area it encloses.
  - action: identify_background_pattern
    description: Analyze the region outside the frame to determine the repeating background pattern unit and colors.
  - action: extract_inner_content
    description: Select the portion of the input grid located strictly inside the identified frame.
  - action: filter_background_pattern
    description: Within the extracted inner content, compare each pixel's color and position to the expected background pattern. Replace matching pixels with white (0). Exception: Do not replace the frame color if it matches the pattern (as seen in Ex 2).
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create a new grid. Set its border (1 pixel thick) to the frame's color. Place the filtered inner content into the center of this new grid.

relationships:
  - relationship: containment
    description: The 'frame' contains the 'inner_objects' and some 'background_pattern' elements.
  - relationship: pattern_removal
    description: Pixels inside the input frame matching the 'background_pattern' are removed (set to white), unless the pixel color is the frame color itself. Other pixels ('inner_objects') are preserved.
