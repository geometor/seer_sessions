            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids are consistently divided into two main rectangular regions, a left one and a right one, separated by a vertical line. There's also an outer border around the entire grid. The color of the border and the dividing line is the same within each example (red in train_1, yellow in train_2).\n2.  **Regions/Containers:** The left and right regions act as distinct containers. Each has a primary background color (blue/yellow in train_1, blue/red in train_2).\n3.  **Objects:** Within the left container, there are distinct shapes or patterns (\"objects\") made of colors different from the left container's background color and the border/divider color. In train_1, these are horizontal green lines and rectangular azure blocks. In train_2, these are rectangular azure blocks of varying sizes.\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation primarily affects the right container. The left container, the border, and the dividing line remain unchanged in the output.\n5.  **Copying Mechanism:** The objects from the left container appear to be copied or transferred into the right container in the output.\n6.  **Placement:**\n    *   The vertical position (row index) of the copied objects in the right container matches the vertical position of the original objects in the left container.\n    *   The shape and size of the copied objects generally match the originals.\n    *   The horizontal placement within the right container seems relative. Objects maintain their position relative to the left edge of their container.\n    *   There's a special case for objects that span the full width of the *left* container (like the green lines in train_1). In the output, these lines span the full width of the *right* container. Objects that do not span the full width of the left container (like the azure blocks) are copied with their original dimensions and relative horizontal position into the right container.\n7.  **Overwriting:** The copied objects overwrite the original background color of the right container at their respective locations.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
