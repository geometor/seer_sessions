"""
Identifies two main regions (left and right) separated by a vertical line, with a surrounding border of the same color as the separator.
Finds distinct objects within the left region (contiguous pixels different from the left background and the border/separator color).
Copies these objects into the right region, preserving their vertical position relative to the top of the region and their horizontal position relative to the left edge of the region.
Objects overwrite the original background color of the right region.
A special case exists for objects that span the full horizontal width of the left region: these objects are copied such that they span the full horizontal width of the *right* region, while maintaining their vertical position.
The border, separator line, and the original content of the left region remain unchanged.
