            "text": "Okay, let's refine our understanding based on the execution results.\n\n### General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial hypothesis about the `X Y X` pattern identifying the \"center row\" was incorrect. The code failed completely on Example 1 because it couldn't find this specific pattern (`2 8 7` was present, but the outer colors weren't identical). In Example 2 and 3, the code *did* find an `X Y X` pattern (`2 6 2` and `4 5 4` respectively), which allowed *some* parts of the transformation (center row expansion, downward projection) to work partially, but the upward projection was incomplete or incorrect compared to the expected output.\n\nThe core issue seems to be:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Key Rows:** The trigger isn't a specific `X Y X` pattern. It's more likely the presence of three vertically adjacent rows, each containing at least one horizontal segment of non-white pixels. The middle of these three rows acts as the \"center row\".\n2.  **Upward Projection:** The initial assumption of a single-step upward projection was insufficient. The expected outputs (especially Example 2 and 3) show that the upper row pixels also cast \"rays\" upwards, mirroring the behaviour of the lower row pixels casting downwards. The direction of the ray (diagonal left, straight up, diagonal right) depends on the pixel's offset from the center of its original segment.\n3.  **Center Row Expansion:** The color used for expansion seems to be the color of the *endpoints* of the segment in the center row, not necessarily related to an `X Y X` pattern within it.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Modify the row identification logic to find the first block of three consecutive rows containing non-white segments.\n2.  Refine the projection logic: apply the ray-casting mechanism (like the one used for downward projection) to the *upward* projection as well, adjusting the vertical direction (`dr = -1`).\n3.  Adjust the center row expansion to use the color of the segment's endpoints.\n4.  Use code execution to verify the structure (rows, segments, centers) for each example.\n\n### Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the key rows in each example.\n\n"

If no such set of three rows exists, stop and return the unmodified output grid.\n3.  **Analyze Segments:**\n    *   For the upper row (`R_upper`), find the horizontal segment of non-white pixels. Record its start column, end column, center column (calculated as `start + floor((end - start) / 2)`), and the list of pixel colors.\n    *   For the center row (`R_center`), find the horizontal segment.

Note the color of the leftmost pixel (`Color_L`) and the rightmost pixel (`Color_R`) of this segment.\n    *   For the lower row (`R_lower`), find the horizontal segment. Record its start/end/center columns and pixel colors.\n4.  **Expand Center Row:** In the output grid, modify the center row (`R_center`):\n    *   For all columns *before* the segment's start column, set the pixel color to `Color_L`.\n    *   For all columns *after* the segment's end column, set the pixel color to `Color_R`.\n    *   Leave the pixels within the original segment's bounds unchanged from the initial copy.\n5.  **Project Upper Row and Cast Rays Upwards:** For each pixel within the upper row's segment (from its start to end column) in the *input* grid:\n    *   Let the pixel's color be `C`, its original column be `C_orig`, and the segment's center column be `Center_upper`.\n    *   Calculate the horizontal offset: `Offset = C_orig - Center_upper`.\n    *   Determine the ray's horizontal step: `DC = +1` if `Offset > 0`, `-1` if `Offset < 0`, `0` if `Offset == 0`.
