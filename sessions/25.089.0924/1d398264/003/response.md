"""
Identifies a block of three vertically adjacent rows containing horizontal non-white pixel segments. 
Performs transformations based on these segments: 
1. Center row expands horizontally: Pixels to the left of the segment are filled with the segment's leftmost color, and pixels to the right are filled with the segment's rightmost color.
2. Upper row projects pixels one step up and horizontally based on their offset from the segment center, then casts rays further upwards in the determined direction (diagonal left, straight up, or diagonal right).
3. Lower row projects pixels one step down and horizontally based on their offset from the segment center, then casts rays further downwards in the determined direction (diagonal left, straight down, or diagonal right).
The output grid starts as a copy of the input, and these operations modify it.
