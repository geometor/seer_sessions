            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this ARC task.\n\n### Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain distinct horizontal segments of non-white pixels, usually arranged in three consecutive rows. The background is white (0).\n2.  **Key Pattern:** A central feature appears to be a specific pattern within one row: a sequence of three non-white pixels where the outer two have the same color (`X`) and the inner pixel has a different color (`Y`), forming an `X Y X` structure. Let's call the row containing this pattern the \"center row\".\n3.  **Associated Rows:** There are typically two other relevant rows containing horizontal segments of non-white pixels: one directly above the center row (\"upper row\") and one directly below (\"lower row\").\n4.  **Transformations:** The transformation seems to involve several distinct projection or drawing operations originating from the pixels in these three key rows:\n    *   **Horizontal Expansion:** The color `X` from the `X Y X` pattern in the center row expands horizontally outwards from the `X` pixels to fill the rest of that row.\n    *   **Upward Projection:** Pixels from the upper row project one step upwards, landing in positions determined by their relative horizontal offset from the center of their segment.\n    *   **Downward Projection:** Pixels from the lower row project similarly one step downwards. Additionally, they cast \"rays\" or \"beams\" further downwards: straight down for the center pixel, diagonally down-left for pixels to the left, and diagonally down-right for pixels to the right. These rays continue until the grid boundary.\n5.  **Output Grid:** The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid, and these projection/expansion operations overwrite the existing pixels.\n\n### YAML Fact Document\n\n"
