Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples for this task.

### Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids containing colored pixels. The background is primarily white (0).
2.  **Key Elements in Input:**
    *   A prominent gray (5) rectangular region.
    *   Inside the gray rectangle, there are a few isolated pixels of distinct colors (e.g., red, green, yellow in train_1; red, yellow, magenta, green in train_2). These seem to function as a palette or key.
    *   Outside the gray rectangle, there are several distinct objects made of a single color (azure 8 in train_1, blue 1 in train_2). These appear to be the objects that undergo transformation. This "target color" (azure or blue) is the most frequent non-gray, non-white color outside the gray rectangle.
3.  **Transformation:**
    *   The gray rectangle and the colored pixels within it remain unchanged in the output.
    *   The objects made of the "target color" (azure or blue) in the input are preserved in shape and position but change their color in the output.
    *   The new colors used for these objects correspond exactly to the colors found within the gray palette region.
4.  **Mapping Logic:** There is a one-to-one correspondence between the target objects outside the palette and the distinct colors inside the palette. The number of target objects matches the number of unique palette colors (excluding gray/white). The specific mapping seems based on order:
    *   The target objects are sorted based on their position (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right using their top-left corner).
    *   The palette colors are sorted based on their position within the gray rectangle (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).
    *   The first sorted target object takes the color of the first sorted palette color, the second object takes the second color, and so on.

### Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills empty space

  - element: palette_region
    color: gray (5)
    shape: rectangle (usually)
    location: varies (top-right in train_1, middle-left in train_2)
    properties:
      - contains distinct 'palette_colors'
      - remains unchanged in the output
    role: defines the set of replacement colors and potentially their order

  - element: palette_colors
    location: within the palette_region
    properties:
      - single pixels
      - colors are distinct (excluding gray/white)
      - count matches the number of 'target_objects'
      - remain unchanged in the output
      - sorted by position (row, then column) define the replacement color sequence
    role: source colors for the transformation

  - element: target_objects
    location: outside the palette_region
    properties:
      - composed of a single 'target_color'
      - 'target_color' is the most frequent non-background, non-gray color outside the palette_region
      - shapes and positions are varied
      - sorted by position (top-most, then left-most pixel) define the object sequence
    role: objects to be recolored

transformation:
  type: recoloring
  input_elements: [target_objects, palette_colors]
  output_elements: modified target_objects (same shape/position, new color)
  rule:
    - Identify the palette_region (gray object).
    - Identify the palette_colors within the palette_region (non-gray, non-white pixels).
    - Sort palette_colors by position (row, then column) to get an ordered list of replacement_colors.
    - Identify the target_color (most frequent non-gray, non-white color outside the palette_region).
    - Identify all distinct target_objects made of the target_color.
    - Sort target_objects by position (top-most, then left-most pixel).
    - For each target_object `i` in the sorted list, recolor it using the replacement_color `i` from the sorted list.
  unchanged_elements: [background, palette_region, palette_colors]
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify the Palette:** Locate the contiguous gray (5) object, which serves as the palette region.
2.  **Extract Palette Colors:** Find all pixels within the palette region that are not gray (5) and not the background color (white 0). Record their colors and their row/column coordinates.
3.  **Order Palette Colors:** Sort the identified palette colors based primarily on their row index (ascending) and secondarily on their column index (ascending). This creates the ordered sequence of replacement colors.
4.  **Identify Target Color:** Examine the area *outside* the palette region. Find the color (other than white 0 or gray 5) that appears most frequently. This is the target color.
5.  **Identify Target Objects:** Locate all distinct contiguous objects composed entirely of the identified target color.
6.  **Order Target Objects:** Sort these target objects based primarily on the row index of their top-most pixel and secondarily on the column index of their left-most pixel.
7.  **Apply Transformation:** Create a copy of the input grid. Iterate through the sorted target objects and the sorted replacement colors simultaneously. For the i-th target object, change the color of all its pixels in the copied grid to the i-th replacement color.
8.  **Output:** The modified grid is the final output.
