            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples for this task.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids containing colored pixels. The background is primarily white (0).\n2.  **Key Elements in Input:**\n    *   A prominent gray (5) rectangular region.\n    *   Inside the gray rectangle, there are a few isolated pixels of distinct colors (e.g., red, green, yellow in train_1; red, yellow, magenta, green in train_2). These seem to function as a palette or key.\n    *   Outside the gray rectangle, there are several distinct objects made of a single color (azure 8 in train_1, blue 1 in train_2). These appear to be the objects that undergo transformation. This \"target color\" (azure or blue) is the most frequent non-gray, non-white color outside the gray rectangle.\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The gray rectangle and the colored pixels within it remain unchanged in the output.\n    *   The objects made of the \"target color\" (azure or blue) in the input are preserved in shape and position but change their color in the output.\n    *   The new colors used for these objects correspond exactly to the colors found within the gray palette region.\n4.  **Mapping Logic:** There is a one-to-one correspondence between the target objects outside the palette and the distinct colors inside the palette. The number of target objects matches the number of unique palette colors (excluding gray/white). The specific mapping seems based on order:\n    *   The target objects are sorted based on their position (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right using their top-left corner).\n    *   The palette colors are sorted based on their position within the gray rectangle (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).\n    *   The first sorted target object takes the color of the first sorted palette color, the second object takes the second color, and so on.\n\n### Facts\n\n"

Record their colors and their row/column coordinates.\n3.  **Order Palette Colors:** Sort the identified palette colors based primarily on their row index (ascending) and secondarily on their column index (ascending). This creates the ordered sequence of replacement colors.\n4.  **Identify Target Color:** Examine the area *outside* the palette region. Find the color (other than white 0 or gray 5) that appears most frequently. This is the target color.\n5.  **Identify Target Objects:** Locate all distinct contiguous objects composed entirely of the identified target color.\n6.  **Order Target Objects:** Sort these target objects based primarily on the row index of their top-most pixel and secondarily on the column index of their left-most pixel.\n7.  **Apply Transformation:** Create a copy of the input grid. Iterate through the sorted target objects and the sorted replacement colors simultaneously. For the i-th target object, change the color of all its pixels in the copied grid to the i-th replacement color.\n8.  **Output:** The modified grid is the final output."
