It looks like this:\n        "

Let's call the central red pixel of this shape the 'source' pixel.\n3.  **Output Grid Composition:** The output grid retains all the red (2) and green (3) pixels from the input grid in their original positions. Additionally, blue (1) pixels are introduced.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The blue (1) pixels appear in areas that were originally white (0) in the input. The placement and extent of the blue pixels are determined by a process originating from the 'source' pixel(s) of the green H-shape(s) and constrained by the red (2) boundaries. It looks like a flood fill mechanism.\n5.  **Flood Fill Behavior:**\n    *   The fill process seems to start from the 'source' pixel (the red center of an H-shape).\n    *   The fill spreads outwards (up, down, left, right) into adjacent cells.\n    *   If the fill reaches a white (0) cell, that cell becomes blue (1) in the output.\n    *   The fill can pass through green (3) cells without changing them.\n    *   The fill is stopped by red (2) cells; these act as impenetrable walls.\n    *   The fill is also stopped by the grid boundaries.\n    *   If there are multiple H-shapes, each initiates its own fill process. The resulting blue areas might merge if they are part of the same connected region not separated by red walls.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Check the color of the neighbor cell at (nr, nc) in the *input* grid.\n        iii. If the neighbor's color is red (2), do nothing (it's a boundary).
