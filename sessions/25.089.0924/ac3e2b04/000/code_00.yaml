Task: Fill enclosed areas triggered by a specific pattern.

Input_Objects:
  - Type: Background
    Color: white (0)
    Role: Fillable space.
  - Type: Boundary
    Color: red (2)
    Role: Acts as an impenetrable wall for the fill process. Forms lines or shapes. Persists in the output.
  - Type: Trigger_Pattern (H-shape)
    Structure: 3x3 grid
    Pixels:
      - Corners and Mid-Sides: green (3)
      - Center: red (2) - This is the 'source' pixel.
    Role: Initiates the fill process. The pattern itself (green and red pixels) persists in the output.

Output_Objects:
  - Type: Background
    Color: white (0)
    Role: Persists only if not part of a filled region.
  - Type: Boundary
    Color: red (2)
    Role: Same as input.
  - Type: Trigger_Pattern (H-shape)
    Pixels: Same as input.
    Role: Same as input.
  - Type: Filled_Area
    Color: blue (1)
    Role: Replaces white (0) pixels in regions reachable by the fill process.

Transformation_Rules:
  - Rule: Flood Fill
    Origin: Starts from the 'source' pixel (red center) of each H-shape identified in the input.
    Target: Changes white (0) pixels to blue (1).
    Connectivity: 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
    Boundaries: Red (2) pixels and grid edges block the fill.
    Traversal: Fill can pass through green (3) pixels without altering them.
    Scope: Applies to all white (0) pixels reachable from a 'source' pixel without crossing a red (2) boundary.
  - Rule: Preservation
    Affected_Pixels: Red (2) and green (3) pixels.
    Action: Remain unchanged from input to output grid.

Relationships:
  - The H-shape's 'source' pixel location determines the starting point for filling.
  - Red (2) pixels define the containment regions for the blue (1) fill.
  - White (0) pixels within a reachable, contained area are converted to blue (1).
