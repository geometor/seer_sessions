Transformation Rule:

1.  Identify all occurrences of a specific 3x3 pattern ("H-shape") in the input grid. This pattern consists of a central red (2) pixel surrounded by eight green (3) pixels.
2.  For each identified H-shape, locate its central red pixel (the 'source').
3.  Initiate a flood fill process starting from the neighbors of each 'source' pixel.
4.  The flood fill spreads outwards in four directions (up, down, left, right) into adjacent cells.
5.  If the fill encounters a white (0) pixel in the input grid, that pixel is changed to blue (1) in the output grid.
6.  The fill can pass through green (3) pixels without changing their color.
7.  The fill is blocked by red (2) pixels (which act as boundaries) and the edges of the grid.
8.  All original red (2) and green (3) pixels from the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
9.  Pixels that are not part of the H-shape, are not red boundaries, and are not reachable by the flood fill remain white (0).
