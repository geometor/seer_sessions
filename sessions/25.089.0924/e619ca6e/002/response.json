            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components (green blocks) and the basic replication idea. However, it failed to capture the full extent of the replication and the boundary interaction. The failure on Example 1 was subtle, involving boundary clipping of the *last* generated copy in a sequence. The failures on Examples 2 and 3 were more significant, indicating that the replication process is not just a single step applied to the original blocks but an iterative process where certain copies generate further copies based on a consistent offset rule (`+h`, `+w`), continuing until the copies go out of bounds. The boundary interaction needs refinement: copies are drawn even if they only partially fit, with the out-of-bounds parts being clipped.\n\n**Strategy**\n\n1.  **Confirm Object Properties:** Verify the position (r, c), height (h), and width (w) for each object in the training inputs using code execution.\n2.  **Refine Replication Rule:** Model the transformation as follows:\n    *   Start with the input grid.\n    *   Find all original non-white blocks.\n    *   For each original block (r, c, h, w, color):\n        *   Define two initial \"spawn\" points relative to the original: P1 = (r+h, c-w) and P2 = (r+h, c+w).\n        *   Draw the block (clipped) at P1.\n        *   Draw the block (clipped) at P2.\n        *   Start a \"chain reaction\" from P2:\n            *   Set `current_pos = P2`.\n            *   Loop:\n                *   Calculate `next_pos = (current_pos[0] + h, current_pos[1] + w)`.\n                *   If `next_pos` is within grid limits (specifically, `next_pos[0] < grid_rows` and `next_pos[1] < grid_cols`), draw the block (clipped) at `next_pos` and update `current_pos = next_pos`.\n                *   Otherwise, break the loop (the chain goes out of bounds).\n3.  **Implement Clipping:** Ensure the drawing function correctly handles partial placement near boundaries.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the iterative chain reaction and clipping.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
