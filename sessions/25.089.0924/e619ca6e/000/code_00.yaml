task_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
      content: contains discrete objects

objects:
  - type: block
    properties:
      color: green (3) # or potentially any non-white color
      shape: rectangle (contiguous pixels of the same color)
      attributes:
        - height (h)
        - width (w)
        - position (top-left corner: r, c)

actions:
  - type: identify
    description: Find all distinct non-white blocks in the input grid.
    target: objects
  - type: measure
    description: Determine the height (h), width (w), and top-left position (r, c) for each identified block.
    target: objects
  - type: replicate
    description: Create three identical copies of each original block.
    target: objects
  - type: translate
    description: Place the copies relative to the original block's position and dimensions.
    target: replicated objects

relationships:
  - type: spatial_offset
    description: The placement of the three copies depends on the original object's height (h) and width (w).
    details:
      - copy_1_offset: (+h rows, -w columns) relative to original top-left
      - copy_2_offset: (+h rows, +w columns) relative to original top-left
      - copy_3_offset: (+2*h rows, +2*w columns) relative to original top-left
  - type: preservation
    description: Original objects remain in their initial position in the output grid.
    target: objects

constraints:
  - type: boundary
    description: Copies are placed only if they fit entirely within the grid dimensions. (Implied, not explicitly tested by examples provided).
  - type: color_invariance
    description: The color of the copied objects is the same as the original object.
