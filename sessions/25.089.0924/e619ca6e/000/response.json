            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels, predominantly white (0), with some objects made of green (3) pixels. The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output for each example.\n2.  **Object Identification:** The core elements in the input grids are rectangular blocks of green pixels. These blocks vary in size and position across the examples. Example 1 has one block, Example 2 has three, and Example 3 has two.\n3.  **Transformation Observation:** The key transformation is the replication and displacement of the original green blocks. In the output, the original block(s) from the input remain in their initial positions. Additionally, for each original block, three identical copies appear at new positions.\n4.  **Displacement Pattern:** The positions of the three new copies relative to the original block seem deterministic and related to the dimensions (height and width) of the original block.\n    *   Let the original block have its top-left corner at (row `r`, column `c`), height `h`, and width `w`.\n    *   Copy 1 appears to be shifted down by `h` rows and left by `w` columns. Its top-left corner is at (`r + h`, `c - w`).\n    *   Copy 2 appears to be shifted down by `h` rows and right by `w` columns. Its top-left corner is at (`r + h`, `c + w`).\n    *   Copy 3 appears to be shifted down by `2*h` rows and right by `2*w` columns. Its top-left corner is at (`r + 2*h`, `c + 2*w`).\n5.  **Consistency:** This pattern of replication and displacement holds true for all green blocks across all three training examples. The color of the blocks (green) is preserved in the copies. The background remains white.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
