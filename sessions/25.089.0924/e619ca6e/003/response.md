Transformation Rule:
1. Identify all distinct, contiguous, solid rectangular blocks of non-white pixels in the input grid.
2. For each identified block with top-left corner (r, c), height h, width w, and color C:
   a. Copy the input grid to initialize the output grid (if not already done).
   b. Calculate the position for the first copy: `pos1 = (r + h, c - w)`.
   c. Calculate the starting position for the diagonal chain of copies: `start_chain_pos = (r + h, c + w)`.
   d. Draw a copy of the block, clipped to the grid boundaries, starting at `pos1` onto the output grid.
   e. Initialize the current position for the chain: `current_pos = start_chain_pos`.
   f. Start a loop for the diagonal chain:
      i.   Check if the current top-left corner `current_pos` is within the grid boundaries (i.e., `current_pos[0] < grid_rows` and `current_pos[1] < grid_cols`). If not, break the loop (the entire block is off-grid).
      ii.  Draw a copy of the block, clipped to the grid boundaries, starting at `current_pos` onto the output grid.
      iii. Calculate the next position in the chain: `next_pos = (current_pos[0] + h, current_pos[1] + w)`.
      iv.  Update `current_pos = next_pos`.
3. Repeat step 2 for all original blocks found. The drawing operations modify the same output grid.
4. Return the final modified output grid.
