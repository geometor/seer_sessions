Identify all distinct, contiguous, solid rectangular blocks of non-white pixels in the input grid.\n2. For each identified block with top-left corner (r, c), height h, width w, and color C:\n   a. Copy the input grid to initialize the output grid (if not already done).\n   b. Calculate the position for the first copy: `pos1 = (r + h, c - w)`.\n   c. Calculate the starting position for the diagonal chain of copies: `start_chain_pos = (r + h, c + w)`.\n   d. Draw a copy of the block, clipped to the grid boundaries, starting at `pos1` onto the output grid.\n   e. Initialize the current position for the chain: `current_pos = start_chain_pos`.\n   f. Start a loop for the diagonal chain:\n      i.   Check if the current top-left corner `current_pos` is within the grid boundaries (i.e., `current_pos[0] < grid_rows` and `current_pos[1] < grid_cols`). If not, break the loop (the entire block is off-grid).\n      ii.  Draw a copy of the block, clipped to the grid boundaries, starting at `current_pos` onto the output grid.\n      iii. Calculate the next position in the chain: `next_pos = (current_pos[0] + h, current_pos[1] + w)`.\n      iv.  Update `current_pos = next_pos`.\n3. Repeat step 2 for all original blocks found. The drawing operations modify the same output grid.\n4. Return the final modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all distinct contiguous blocks of non-white pixels in the grid,\n    assuming they are solid rectangles.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an object\n              and contains 'color', 'min_r', 'min_c', 'height', 'width'.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = set()\n    objects = []\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and (r, c) not in visited:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                obj_pixels = set()\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited.add((r, c))\n                min_r, max_r = r, r\n                min_c, max_c = c, c\n\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    obj_pixels.add((row, col))\n                    min_r = min(min_r, row)\n                    max_r = max(max_r, row)\n                    min_c = min(min_c, col)\n                    max_c = max(max_c, col)\n\n                    # Check neighbors (4-connectivity)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == color and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                            visited.add((nr, nc))\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n\n                # Verify it's a solid rectangle within its bounding box\n                is_solid_rectangle = True\n                height = max_r - min_r + 1\n                width = max_c - min_c + 1\n                if len(obj_pixels) != height * width:\n                     is_solid_rectangle = False\n                else: # Double check all pixels within bbox are the object color\n                    for br in range(min_r, max_r + 1):\n                         for bc in range(min_c, max_c + 1):\n                             if grid[br, bc] != color:\n                                 is_solid_rectangle = False\n                                 break\n                         if not is_solid_rectangle:\n                             break\n\n                if is_solid_rectangle: # Only add if it's a solid rectangular block\n                    objects.append({\n                        'color': color,\n                        'min_r': min_r,\n                        'min_c': min_c,\n                        'height': height,\n                        'width': width\n                    })\n    return objects\n\ndef draw_clipped_object(grid, color, top_r, top_c, height, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Draws a solid rectangle (object) onto the grid, clipping it if it\n    goes out of bounds.
