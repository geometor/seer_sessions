Transformation Rule:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Identify all distinct, contiguous, solid rectangular blocks of non-white pixels in the input grid.
3. For each identified block with top-left corner (r, c), height h, width w, and color C:
    a. Generate a chain of copies moving diagonally down and left:
        i.   Start at position (r + h, c - w).
        ii.  Repeatedly add (h, -w) to the current position.
        iii. For each position in the chain, draw a copy of the block (clipped to grid boundaries) onto the output grid.
        iv.  Stop the chain when the block's top-left corner goes beyond the bottom boundary (row >= grid_height) or the block's right edge goes beyond the left boundary (col + width <= 0).
    b. Generate a chain of copies moving diagonally down and right:
        i.   Start at position (r + h, c + w).
        ii.  Repeatedly add (h, w) to the current position.
        iii. For each position in the chain, draw a copy of the block (clipped to grid boundaries) onto the output grid.
        iv.  Stop the chain when the block's top-left corner goes beyond the bottom boundary (row >= grid_height) or the block's left edge goes beyond the right boundary (col >= grid_width).
4. Return the final modified output grid.
