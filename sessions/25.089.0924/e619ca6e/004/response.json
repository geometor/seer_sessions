            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code failed because the underlying hypothesis about the transformation rule was incorrect. The first attempt assumed three specific copies were generated based on the first example. The subsequent refinement introduced a single diagonal chain starting from one of those copies. However, comparing the failed outputs with the expected outputs, particularly the clipped shapes near the boundaries and the results for examples with multiple objects, revealed a different pattern.\n\nThe revised analysis suggests that for each original non-white rectangular object, two independent \"chains\" of copies are generated:\n1.  One chain moves diagonally down and left (adding `+h`, `-w` repeatedly).\n2.  One chain moves diagonally down and right (adding `+h`, `+w` repeatedly).\nBoth chains start their displacement relative to the *original* object's position. Copies are drawn even if partially clipped by the grid boundaries. The chains stop generating further copies once the calculated top-left position of the *next* copy falls entirely outside the grid.\n\nThis"
