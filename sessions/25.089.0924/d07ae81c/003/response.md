```python
"""
Implements a cellular automaton-like transformation where pixels of certain "source" colors
iteratively "paint" adjacent pixels of specific "target" colors according to fixed rules,
until the grid state stabilizes.

The painting process continues in iterations. In each iteration, the state of the grid
for the *next* step is calculated based *entirely* on the grid's state at the *current* step.
The update is simultaneous in concept, though implemented sequentially. The process stops
when a full iteration results in no changes to the grid.

The rules defining which source color can paint which target color are:
- Blue(1) paints Red(2) and Azure(8).
- Red(2) paints Blue(1).
- Green(3) paints Blue(1) and Magenta(6).
- Yellow(4) paints Red(2).
- Azure(8) paints Blue(1), Green(3), and Magenta(6).

Only orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are considered for painting influence.
If multiple neighbors attempt to paint the same target cell in one iteration, the one
processed last in the standard top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan of source cells
will determine the final color for that target cell in the next grid state.
