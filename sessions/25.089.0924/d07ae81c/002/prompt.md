"""
Implements a cellular automaton-like transformation where pixels of certain "source" colors 
iteratively "paint" adjacent pixels of specific "target" colors according to fixed rules.

The painting process continues in iterations until no more pixels change color in a full pass 
over the grid. The rules are:
- Blue(1) paints Red(2) and Azure(8).
- Red(2) paints Blue(1).
- Green(3) paints Blue(1) and Magenta(6).
- Yellow(4) paints Red(2).
- Azure(8) paints Blue(1), Green(3), and Magenta(6).

Only orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are considered for painting.
