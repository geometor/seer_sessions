            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code timed out, indicating that the iterative process either entered an infinite loop or required too many iterations to complete within the time limit. The primary suspect identified during analysis is the potential for oscillations based on the defined painting rules (e.g., Blue(1) paints Red(2), and Red(2) paints Blue(1); Blue(1) paints Azure(8), and Azure(8) paints Blue(1)). The implementation might not handle these reciprocal rules correctly, leading to endless back-and-forth painting between adjacent pixels.\n\nAnother possibility is that the way updates were handled within an iteration (modifying `next_grid` while still iterating based on `current_grid`) might interact poorly with the termination condition (`changes_made`).\n\nThe strategy is to refine the understanding of the update rule within each iteration to ensure it correctly models simultaneous updates based solely on the state at the beginning of the iteration and to guarantee termination, possibly by preventing direct reversals within a single step or by ensuring the overall state eventually stabilizes.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\n*   **Oscillation Potential:** As noted, the rules {1: [2, 8], 2: [1], 8: [1, 3, 6]} allow for direct 1 <-> 2 and 1 <-> 8 oscillations between adjacent cells. If cell A (color 1) is next to cell B (color 2), A will paint B blue in iteration N. In iteration N+1, B (now blue) is next to A (still blue, but originally red), so the rule 2->1 might cause B to attempt to paint A red again, leading to a potential loop. The original code *might* have implicitly handled this via iteration order and the `next_grid[nr, nc] != source_color` check, but this is not robust.\n*   **Update Mechanism:** The standard cellular automaton approach calculates the entire `next_grid` based solely on the `current_grid`. Changes within an iteration should not influence other calculations in the *same* iteration. Let's re-evaluate the code structure to adhere strictly to this principle.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

The process repeats until no pixels change color between two consecutive iterations.\n\nRelationships:\n  - Adjacency: Painting influence occurs between orthogonally adjacent pixels (sharing an edge).\n  - Painting Rules (Source -> Target):\n    - Blue(1) can paint over Red(2) or Azure(8).\n    - Red(2) can paint over Blue(1).\n    - Green(3) can paint over Blue(1) or Magenta(6).\n    - Yellow(4) can paint over Red(2).\n    - Azure(8) can paint over Blue(1), Green(3), or Magenta(6).\n  - Update Conflict: If multiple neighbors attempt to paint the same target cell in one iteration, the behavior needs clarification. (Hypothesis: The simulation might proceed such that only one 'wins' based on iteration order, or perhaps such conflicts are designed not to occur critically in the test cases).\n  - Stability: The process terminates when a full iteration pass results in a grid identical to the previous iteration's grid. Potential oscillations (e.g., 1<->2, 1<->8) must be handled implicitly or explicitly by the update logic to ensure termination.\n\n```"

Initialize `current_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.\n3.  Start an iterative process:\n    a. Create a `next_grid` initialized as an identical copy of the `current_grid`.\n    b. Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` in the `current_grid`. Let `source_color` be the color at `current_grid[r, c]`.\n    c. Check if `source_color` is one of the defined source colors (1, 2, 3, 4, 8).\n    d. If it is a source color, examine each of its orthogonal neighbors `(nr, nc)` within the grid boundaries.

If it is a valid target, update the cell `(nr, nc)` in the `next_grid` to `source_color`. **Crucially, this update is recorded in `next_grid` based on the state found in `current_grid`.** If multiple neighbors attempt to paint the same cell `(nr, nc)` during this iteration, the one processed *last* according to the `(r, c)` loop order will determine the final color in `next_grid`.\n    g.
