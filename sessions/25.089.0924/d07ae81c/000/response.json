            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation appears to be a form of cellular automaton or iterative \"painting\" process based on local neighbor interactions.\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both are 2D arrays of integers (colors) with identical dimensions for each example pair.\n2.  **Colors:** Specific colors seem to act as \"sources\" or \"paint\", while others act as \"targets\" or \"paintable surfaces\". The background or dominant colors are often targets.\n3.  **Interaction:** The change in a pixel's color depends on the colors of its immediate orthogonal (up, down, left, right) neighbors.\n4.  **Color Relationships:** There are fixed rules defining which color can \"paint over\" which other color(s). These rules seem consistent across all examples:\n    *   Blue (1) can paint over Red (2) and Azure (8).\n    *   Red (2) can paint over Blue (1).\n    *   Green (3) can paint over Blue (1) and Magenta (6).\n    *   Yellow (4) can paint over Red (2).\n    *   Azure (8) can paint over Blue (1), Green (3), and Magenta (6).\n5.  **Process:** The painting doesn't happen in a single step. Instead, it seems iterative. Colors spread outwards from the source pixels, converting adjacent target pixels turn by turn, until no more valid painting actions can occur in a full pass over the grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Define the \"painting rules\" specifying which source color can paint over which target color(s):\n    *   Blue (1) paints Red (2) and Azure (8).\n    *   Red (2) paints Blue (1).\n    *   Green (3) paints Blue (1) and Magenta (6).\n    *   Yellow (4) paints Red (2).\n    *   Azure (8) paints Blue (1), Green (3), and Magenta (6).\n2.  Initialize the `current_grid` as a direct copy of the `input_grid`.\n3.  Start an iterative process:\n    a. Create a `next_grid` as a copy of the `current_grid`.\n    b. Set a flag `changes_made` to `False`.\n    c. Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` in the `current_grid`. Let the color of this cell be `source_color`.\n    d. Check if `source_color` is one of the defined source colors (1, 2, 3, 4, 8).\n    e. If it is a source color, examine each of its orthogonal neighbors `(nr, nc)` within the grid boundaries. Let the neighbor's color be `target_color`.\n    f. Check if `target_color` can be painted by `source_color` according to the painting rules.\n    g. If it can be painted AND the color in the `next_grid` at `(nr, nc)` is not already `source_color`, then update the `next_grid` at `(nr, nc)` to `source_color` and set `changes_made` to `True`.\n    h. After iterating through all cells, if `changes_made` is `False`, the process is complete. Break the loop.\n    i. If `changes_made` is `True`, update `current_grid` to be `next_grid` and continue to the next iteration (go back to step 3a).\n4.  The final state of the `current_grid` is the `output_grid`."
