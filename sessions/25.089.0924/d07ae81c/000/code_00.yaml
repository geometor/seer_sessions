GridProperties:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - The transformation preserves the grid size.

PixelColors:
  - Pixels are represented by integers 0-9 (colors).
  - Specific colors have roles:
    - Source Colors (Initiate painting): Blue(1), Red(2), Green(3), Yellow(4), Azure(8)
    - Target Colors (Can be painted over): Blue(1), Red(2), Green(3), Magenta(6), Azure(8)
    - Uninvolved Colors: White(0), Gray(5), Orange(7), Maroon(9) seem unaffected and do not participate in painting.

Actions:
  - Painting: A source color pixel changes the color of an adjacent target pixel to the source color.
  - Iteration: The painting process repeats across the grid until a stable state is reached (no more pixels change color in a full iteration).

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Painting action occurs between orthogonally adjacent pixels (sharing an edge, not just a corner).
  - Painting Rules (Source -> Target):
    - Blue(1) -> [Red(2), Azure(8)]
    - Red(2) -> [Blue(1)]
    - Green(3) -> [Blue(1), Magenta(6)]
    - Yellow(4) -> [Red(2)]
    - Azure(8) -> [Blue(1), Green(3), Magenta(6)]
  - Stability: The process terminates when an iteration completes with no color changes.
