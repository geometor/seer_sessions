If a pixel in the overlap region has the color of the first object in the input, it takes the color of the second object in the output, and vice-versa.\n    *   The overlap region appears to be defined by the intersection of the bounding boxes of the two non-background objects.\n    *   Pixels outside this intersection region remain unchanged. Background pixels within the intersection also remain unchanged (though none appear in the examples).\n\n*   **YAML documenting facts:**\n    "
