*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input and output grids are the same size (16x16 in the examples).
    *   There is a dominant background color, which is orange (7).
    *   Each input grid contains exactly two distinct non-background colored objects.
        *   Example 1: A blue (1) object and a yellow (4) object.
        *   Example 2: A gray (5) object and a maroon (9) object.
    *   The two non-background objects overlap or intersect spatially.
    *   The transformation only affects the pixels located in the region where the two non-background objects overlap.
    *   Specifically, within the overlap region, the color of the pixels is swapped. If a pixel in the overlap region has the color of the first object in the input, it takes the color of the second object in the output, and vice-versa.
    *   The overlap region appears to be defined by the intersection of the bounding boxes of the two non-background objects.
    *   Pixels outside this intersection region remain unchanged. Background pixels within the intersection also remain unchanged (though none appear in the examples).

      properties:
        - color: non-background color code (e.g., 1, 4, 5, 9)
        - shape: Rectangular or linear in examples
        - contiguity: Assumed to be contiguous blocks of the same color
      identification: Identify all contiguous regions of pixels not matching the background color.
    relationships:
      - type: spatial_overlap
        description: The two non-background colored objects occupy intersecting spatial regions.
        determination: Calculate the bounding box for each of the two non-background colors. The intersection of these bounding boxes defines the overlap region.
    transformation:
      type: color_swap_in_overlap
      scope: Applied only to pixels within the calculated overlap region.
      rule: For each pixel within the overlap region:
             1. Identify its color in the input grid (InputColor).
             2. Identify the two non-background colors present in the grid (ColorA, ColorB).
             3. If InputColor is ColorA, the output color for that pixel is ColorB.
             4. If InputColor is ColorB, the output color for that pixel is ColorA.
      unchanged_pixels: Pixels outside the overlap region, and any background-colored pixels within the overlap region, retain their original color.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the background color (orange, 7).
    3.  Identify all unique non-background colors present in the input grid. There should be exactly two (let's call them Color A and Color B). If not, return the input grid unchanged.
    4.  Find all pixels corresponding to Color A and calculate their bounding box (min_row_A, max_row_A, min_col_A, max_col_A).
    5.  Find all pixels corresponding to Color B and calculate their bounding box (min_row_B, max_row_B, min_col_B, max_col_B).
    6.  Calculate the intersection region of the two bounding boxes:
        *   `intersect_min_row = max(min_row_A, min_row_B)`
        *   `intersect_max_row = min(max_row_A, max_row_B)`
        *   `intersect_min_col = max(min_col_A, min_col_B)`
        *   `intersect_max_col = min(max_col_A, max_col_B)`
    7.  Iterate through each pixel location (row, col) within this intersection region (from `intersect_min_row` to `intersect_max_row` and `intersect_min_col` to `intersect_max_col`).
    8.  For each pixel (row, col) in the intersection:
        *   Get the color of the pixel from the input grid: `InputColor = input_grid[row][col]`.
        *   If `InputColor` is Color A, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to Color B: `output_grid[row][col] = Color B`.
        *   If `InputColor` is Color B, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to Color A: `output_grid[row][col] = Color A`.
        *   (If `InputColor` is the background color, it remains unchanged as per step 1).
    9.  Return the modified output grid.
