GridProperties:
  - Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
PixelColors:
  - white: 0
  - blue: 1
  - red: 2
  - green: 3
  - yellow: 4
  - gray: 5
  - magenta: 6
  - orange: 7
  - azure: 8
  - maroon: 9
Objects:
  - Red Pixels: Color value 2. These act as triggers.
  - Green Pixels: Color value 3. These are potentially transformed.
  - Blue Pixels: Color value 1. These are the result of the transformation.
  - Other Pixels: All other colors (0, 4-9). These are unaffected by the transformation.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: The transformation depends on the 8-way adjacency (including diagonals) between green pixels and red pixels.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all red pixels (2) in the input grid.
  - Neighborhood Check: For each red pixel, examine its 8 neighboring cells (Moore neighborhood).
  - Conditional Transformation: If a neighboring cell in the input grid contains a green pixel (3), change the color of that corresponding cell in the output grid to blue (1).
  - Preservation: All red pixels (2) remain red (2) in the output grid. All other pixels (not red and not green neighbors of red) retain their original color from the input grid.
