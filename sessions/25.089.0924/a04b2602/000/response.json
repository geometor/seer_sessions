Other colors appear but seem unaffected and uninvolved in the primary transformation.\nThe transformation involves changing certain green pixels (3) to blue pixels (1).\nRed pixels (2) seem to act as triggers or catalysts for this change. They remain unchanged in the output.\nThe change from green to blue happens in the immediate vicinity of red pixels. Specifically, any green pixel that is one of the 8 neighbors (including diagonals) of a red pixel in the input grid becomes a blue pixel in the output grid.\nIf a pixel is a neighbor to multiple red pixels, it still just turns blue if it was originally green.\nPixels that are not red and are not green neighbors of a red pixel retain their original color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

These act as triggers.\n  - Green Pixels: Color value 3. These are potentially transformed.\n  - Blue Pixels: Color value 1. These are the result of the transformation.\n  - Other Pixels: All other colors (0, 4-9). These are unaffected by the transformation.\nRelationships:\n  - Adjacency: The transformation depends on the 8-way adjacency (including diagonals) between green pixels and red pixels.\nActions:\n  - Identify: Locate all red pixels (2) in the input grid.\n  - Neighborhood Check: For each red pixel, examine its 8 neighboring cells (Moore neighborhood).\n  - Conditional Transformation: If a neighboring cell in the input grid contains a green pixel (3), change the color of that corresponding cell in the output grid to blue (1).\n  - Preservation: All red pixels (2) remain red (2) in the output grid. All other pixels (not red and not green neighbors of red) retain their original color from the input grid.\n```"
