task_elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: input/output pair
      - content: pixels with color values 0-9
      - structure: divided by separator lines
  - element: separator_lines
    properties:
      - role: divide grid into compartments
      - color: consistent within a task (azure/8 in train_1, green/3 in train_2), determined as the most frequent non-white color forming lines
      - orientation: horizontal and vertical
      - persistence: unchanged between input and output
  - element: compartments
    properties:
      - shape: square (e.g., 4x4 excluding separators)
      - location: defined by separator lines
      - content_input: variable (shapes, single colors, noise colors, empty/white)
      - content_output: fixed pattern, variable color
  - element: row_color
    properties:
      - scope: applies to a horizontal row of compartments
      - determination: derived from the single 'significant' non-white, non-separator color present in the input compartments of that row (ignoring 'noise' colors like gray/5 or magenta/6)
      - role: determines the color used for the pattern in the output compartments of that row
  - element: output_pattern
    properties:
      - shape: fixed spatial arrangement of pixels within a compartment
      - coordinates (relative to 4x4 compartment): [(0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1)]
      - color: determined by the row_color
      - application: stamped into every compartment in the output grid (excluding separators)

relationships:
  - input grid and output grid have the same dimensions.
  - separator lines define compartments in both input and output.
  - the color used in the output pattern for a specific compartment depends on the row it belongs to and the 'significant' color found in that row in the input.
  - 'Noise' colors (like gray/5, magenta/6) in the input do not influence the output color or pattern.

actions:
  - identify the separator color and lines.
  - identify the compartments defined by the separators.
  - for each row of compartments:
    - find the 'row color' from the input, ignoring separators and noise colors.
  - create the output grid:
    - copy separator lines.
    - for each compartment:
      - determine its row color.
      - apply the fixed output_pattern using the determined row color, replacing original content. Make non-pattern pixels within the compartment white (0).
