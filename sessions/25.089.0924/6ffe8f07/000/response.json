Scattered across the grid are several distinct rectangular objects composed of non-white pixels (colors like blue-1, red-2, azure-8).\n2.  **Key Object**: A prominent feature in all inputs is a solid rectangle made of azure pixels (8). Its position varies, but it's generally somewhat central.\n3.  **Other Objects**: Besides the azure rectangle, there are other rectangular blocks of blue (1) and red (2) pixels. Their number, size, and position vary across examples.\n4.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grids retain the original non-white objects (azure, blue, red) in their exact input positions and colors. The significant change is the introduction of yellow pixels (4).\n5.  **Yellow Pixel Pattern**: The yellow pixels (4) appear to replace *some* of the original white pixels (0) from the input. They form a large rectangular area.\n6.  **Relationship**: The yellow area seems spatially related to the locations of *all* the non-white objects in the input. Specifically, it fills the white space *within* the overall bounding box defined by all the non-white objects (including the azure one).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Determine the smallest rectangle (the bounding box) that encloses all these non-white pixels. Identify its top-most row, bottom-most row, left-most column, and right-most column.\n4.  Create a new grid, initially identical to the input grid. This will be the output grid.\n5.  Examine every pixel within the calculated bounding box area (from the top row to the bottom row, and from the left column to the right column) in the *original input grid*.\n6.  If a pixel within this bounding box area in the *input grid* is white (0), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the *output grid* to yellow (4).\n7.  If a pixel within the bounding box area in the *input grid* is *not* white (i.e., it was part of an original object), leave the corresponding pixel in the *output grid* unchanged (it keeps its original color).\n8.  Pixels outside the bounding box area remain unchanged from the input grid to the output grid.\n9.  The final modified grid is the result."
