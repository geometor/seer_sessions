task_description: Fill the background within the bounding box of all non-background objects with yellow, preserving the original objects.

elements:
  - element_type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Passive space filler in input, selectively replaced in output.
  - element_type: object
    color: azure (8)
    shape: solid rectangle
    role: Primary object, always present, position retained. Contributes to bounding box calculation.
  - element_type: object
    color: blue (1)
    shape: solid rectangle(s)
    role: Secondary object(s), presence/size/position varies, positions retained. Contribute to bounding box calculation.
  - element_type: object
    color: red (2)
    shape: solid rectangle(s)
    role: Secondary object(s), presence/size/position varies, positions retained. Contribute to bounding box calculation.
  - element_type: fill_color
    color: yellow (4)
    role: Introduced in the output to replace specific background pixels.

relationships:
  - type: bounding_box
    scope: All non-white pixels in the input grid.
    purpose: Defines the area where transformations occur.
  - type: preservation
    scope: All non-white pixels from the input grid.
    action: Their color and position are maintained in the output grid.
  - type: replacement
    scope: White (0) pixels within the calculated bounding box in the input grid.
    action: These pixels are changed to yellow (4) in the output grid.

actions:
  - action: identify_non_white
    input: input grid
    output: set of coordinates for all pixels with color > 0
  - action: calculate_bounding_box
    input: set of non-white coordinates
    output: minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column
  - action: create_output_grid
    based_on: input grid (copy)
  - action: fill_background
    target: output grid
    condition: Iterate through cells within the bounding box. If the corresponding input cell is white (0).
    effect: Change the output cell color to yellow (4).
