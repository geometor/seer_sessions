**Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code correctly identified the concept of filling white background pixels with yellow, but it incorrectly defined the *area* to be filled. It assumed the fill area was the bounding box of *all* non-white objects. The results show this fills too large an area.

Comparing the expected outputs with the transformed outputs reveals that the yellow fill (4) consistently appears in rows *or* columns that intersect with the bounding box of the *azure (8) object specifically*. The fill only replaces original white (0) pixels within this "cross" or "plus-sign" shape defined by the azure object's row and column span. Pixels outside this shape, and original non-white pixels inside the shape, are preserved.

The strategy is to:
1.  Isolate the azure (8) object.
2.  Determine its bounding box (min/max row, min/max column).
3.  Create the output grid by copying the input.
4.  Iterate through all cells of the grid.
5.  For each cell, check if its row index is within the azure object's row range *or* if its column index is within the azure object's column range.
6.  If it falls within this "cross" shape *and* the original pixel in the input grid was white (0), change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to yellow (4).
7.  Otherwise, the output pixel retains the input pixel's value.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's verify the bounding box of the azure (8) object in each training example.

``` python
import numpy as np

def get_azure_bbox(grid):
    azure_coords = np.argwhere(grid == 8)
    if azure_coords.size == 0:
        return None
    min_row = np.min(azure_coords[:, 0])
    max_row = np.max(azure_coords[:, 0])
    min_col = np.min(azure_coords[:, 1])
    max_col = np.max(azure_coords[:, 1])
    return {'min_row': min_row, 'max_row': max_row, 'min_col': min_col, 'max_col': max_col}

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Start with the input grid.
2.  Identify the rectangular object composed of azure (8) pixels. There will be exactly one such object.
3.  Determine the bounding box of this azure object: find its top-most row (`min_row`), bottom-most row (`max_row`), left-most column (`min_col`), and right-most column (`max_col`).
4.  Create a new grid, initially identical to the input grid. This will be the output grid.
5.  Iterate through each pixel position (`r`, `c`) in the grid.
6.  Check if the pixel's row `r` is within the azure object's row range (from `min_row` to `max_row`, inclusive) OR if the pixel's column `c` is within the azure object's column range (from `min_col` to `max_col`, inclusive).
7.  If the pixel position (`r`, `c`) satisfies the condition in step 6 (i.e., it lies within the horizontal or vertical band defined by the azure object) AND the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *original input grid* is white (0), then change the color of the corresponding pixel `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to yellow (4).
8.  If the pixel position does not satisfy the condition in step 6, or if the original pixel color was not white, leave the corresponding pixel in the *output grid* unchanged (it retains its color from the input grid).
9.  The final modified grid is the result.
