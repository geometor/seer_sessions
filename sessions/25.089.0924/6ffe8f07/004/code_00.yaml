task_description: Fill the background within the overall bounding box of all non-background objects with yellow, preserving the original objects.

elements:
  - element_type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Passive space filler in input, selectively replaced in output.
  - element_type: object
    color: non-white (1-9, specifically 1, 2, 8 seen)
    shape: Primarily solid rectangles, but shape is secondary to location.
    role: Active elements defining the transformation area. Positions and colors are preserved in the output.
  - element_type: fill_color
    color: yellow (4)
    role: Introduced in the output to replace specific background pixels within a calculated area.

relationships:
  - type: bounding_box
    scope: All non-white (color > 0) pixels in the input grid collectively.
    purpose: Defines the rectangular area where background replacement occurs.
  - type: preservation
    scope: All non-white pixels from the input grid.
    action: Their color and position are maintained in the output grid, even if they fall within the calculated bounding box.
  - type: replacement
    scope: White (0) pixels located *within* the calculated overall bounding box in the input grid.
    action: These pixels are changed to yellow (4) in the output grid.

actions:
  - action: identify_non_white
    input: input grid
    output: set of coordinates for all pixels with color > 0
  - action: calculate_overall_bounding_box
    input: set of non-white coordinates
    output: minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column encompassing *all* input coordinates.
  - action: create_output_grid
    based_on: input grid (copy)
  - action: fill_background_in_bbox
    target: output grid
    condition: Iterate through cells within the overall bounding box. If the corresponding input cell is white (0).
    effect: Change the output cell color to yellow (4). Keep non-white cells and cells outside the bbox unchanged.
