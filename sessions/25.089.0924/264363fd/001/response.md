"""
Identifies contiguous regions of non-background colors in the input grid.
Within each region, finds 'trigger' pixels based on the region's color.
For each trigger pixel, modifies the color of all pixels within the same region 
that share the same column as the trigger pixel. The modification rule depends 
on the region's color and the trigger pixel's color:
- Blue-2 region + Yellow-4 trigger -> Green-3 (trigger remains Yellow-4)
- Blue-1 region + Green-3 trigger -> Red-2 (trigger also becomes Red-2)
- Green-3 region + Yellow-4 trigger -> Gray-5 (trigger remains Yellow-4)
Pixels not part of these affected columns/regions, or belonging to the background, remain unchanged.
