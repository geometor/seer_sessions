"""
Identifies contiguous regions of non-background colors in the input grid.
The background color is determined as the most frequent color in the grid.
Within each distinct contiguous region, finds 'trigger' pixels based on the 
region's majority color and the trigger pixel's color according to specific rules.
For each trigger pixel identified within a region:
  - Determines a target color based on the region's color and the trigger's color.
  - Determines if the trigger pixel itself should change to the target color.
  - Changes the color of all pixels within that *same contiguous region* 
    that share the *same column* as the trigger pixel to the target color 
    (potentially including the trigger pixel itself based on the rule).

The specific color transformation rules are:
- Region Color Blue-2 (majority) + Trigger Color Yellow-4 -> Target Color Green-3 (Trigger pixel does NOT change).
- Region Color Blue-1 (majority) + Trigger Color Green-3 -> Target Color Red-2 (Trigger pixel DOES change to Red-2).
- Region Color Green-3 (majority) + Trigger Color Yellow-4 -> Target Color Gray-5 (Trigger pixel does NOT change).

Pixels belonging to the background or pixels in non-background regions that are not 
in a column containing a trigger for that specific region remain unchanged.
