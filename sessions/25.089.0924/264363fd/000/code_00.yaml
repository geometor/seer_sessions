task_description: Modify pixel colors within specific regions based on trigger pixels in the same column.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties: Contains a background color, one or more primary regions, and trigger pixels within those regions.
  - type: background
    properties: The most dominant color in the input grid, remains unchanged.
  - type: region
    properties: A contiguous area of pixels of a single color (Region Color), distinct from the background.
  - type: trigger_pixel
    properties: A pixel of a specific color (Trigger Color) located inside a Region.
  - type: affected_pixel
    properties: A pixel within a Region that shares the same column as a Trigger Pixel within that same Region.

relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: Trigger Pixels are located inside Regions.
  - type: spatial
    description: Affected Pixels are in the same column as a Trigger Pixel.
  - type: belonging
    description: Affected Pixels and the corresponding Trigger Pixel belong to the same contiguous Region instance.

actions:
  - name: identify_regions
    input: input_grid
    output: list of contiguous regions (pixels and Region Color)
  - name: identify_triggers
    input: input_grid, regions
    output: list of trigger pixels (location and Trigger Color) associated with each region
  - name: apply_color_change
    input: input_grid, regions, triggers
    output: output_grid
    details:
      - For each trigger pixel within a region:
        - Identify all pixels in the same column that are part of the same contiguous region.
        - Determine the target color based on the Region Color and Trigger Color pair:
          - (Region=Blue-2, Trigger=Yellow-4) -> Target=Green-3. Trigger pixel remains Yellow-4.
          - (Region=Blue-1, Trigger=Green-3) -> Target=Red-2. Trigger pixel also changes to Red-2.
          - (Region=Green-3, Trigger=Yellow-4) -> Target=Gray-5. Trigger pixel remains Yellow-4.
        - Change the color of the identified pixels (and potentially the trigger) to the Target color.
      - Pixels outside regions or in columns without triggers remain unchanged.

output_grid_properties:
  - Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Background color is preserved.
  - Pixels within regions, in columns containing triggers for that region, are potentially recolored based on specific rules.
  - Trigger pixels may or may not change color depending on the rule.
  - Elements outside the affected regions/columns remain unchanged.
