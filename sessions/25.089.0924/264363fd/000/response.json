            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Background Color:** Each example features a dominant background color (Blue-1 in example 1, Azure-8 in examples 2 and 3) that remains unchanged in the output.\n2.  **Regions of Interest:** Within the background, there are distinct, contiguous regions composed of a single color (Blue-2 in example 1, Blue-1 in example 2, Green-3 in example 3). These regions are the primary focus of the transformation.\n3.  **Trigger Pixels:** Inside these regions of interest, there are specific 'trigger' pixels of a different color (Yellow-4 in example 1, Green-3 in example 2, Yellow-4 in example 3).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the color of pixels within the regions of interest based on the location of the trigger pixels. Specifically, pixels in the same *column* as a trigger pixel, and within the same *contiguous region* as that trigger pixel, undergo a color change.\n5.  **Color Mapping Rules:** The specific color change depends on the color of the region and the color of the trigger pixel:\n    *   Example 1: Blue-2 region + Yellow-4 trigger -> Pixels in the column (originally Blue-2) become Green-3. The Yellow-4 trigger pixel remains unchanged.\n    *   Example 2: Blue-1 region + Green-3 trigger -> Pixels in the column (originally Blue-1 *and* the Green-3 trigger itself) become Red-2.\n    *   Example 3: Green-3 region + Yellow-4 trigger -> Pixels in the column (originally Green-3) become Gray-5. The Yellow-4 trigger pixel remains unchanged.\n6.  **Irrelevant Elements:** Some examples contain other small patterns or scattered pixels outside the main regions of interest (e.g., the Green/Yellow structure in example 1, the Red/Green structure in example 2, the Gray/Magenta/Yellow structure in example 3). These elements are not part of the regions of interest containing triggers and remain unchanged in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all contiguous regions of pixels that are not the most frequent background color. Keep track of the set of coordinates belonging to each distinct region and its color (Region Color).\n3.  Iterate through each identified region.\n4.  Within the current region, find all pixels that act as 'trigger pixels' based on their color (Trigger Color), according to the observed rules: Yellow-4 is a trigger in Blue-2 regions, Green-3 is a trigger in Blue-1 regions, and Yellow-4 is a trigger in Green-3 regions.\n5.  For each trigger pixel found at coordinate (row, column) within the current region (with Region Color C1 and Trigger Color C2):\n    a.  Determine the target color (C3) and whether the trigger pixel itself changes based on the (C1, C2) pair:\n        *   If C1 is Blue-2 and C2 is Yellow-4, C3 is Green-3, and the trigger pixel at (row, column) does *not* change.\n        *   If C1 is Blue-1 and C2 is Green-3, C3 is Red-2, and the trigger pixel at (row, column) *does* change to C3.\n        *   If C1 is Green-3 and C2 is Yellow-4, C3 is Gray-5, and the trigger pixel at (row, column) does *not* change.\n    b.  Iterate through all rows `r_prime` from the top to the bottom of the grid.\n    c.  Consider the pixel at coordinate (`r_prime`, column).\n    d.  Check if the pixel at (`r_prime`, column) belongs to the *same contiguous region* currently being processed.\n    e.  If it does belong to the region, check if it's the trigger pixel itself:\n        *   If it is the trigger pixel *and* the rule dictates the trigger changes color, update the pixel at (`r_prime`, column) in the output grid to C3.\n        *   If it is *not* the trigger pixel, update the pixel at (`r_prime`, column) in the output grid to C3.\n6.
