task_description: "Identify red objects (color 2). For each red object, find the unique closest non-background object in the four cardinal directions. If found, draw a white (color 0) line in the space between the red object and the target object. Replace all original red pixels with the background color."

definitions:
  background_color: The color that occupies the most cells in the input grid.
  red_object: A contiguous block of one or more red pixels (color 2).
  target_object: A contiguous block of one or more pixels whose color is not the background color and not red (color 2).
  cardinal_directions: Up, Down, Left, Right.
  distance: The number of background-colored cells strictly between the edge of the red object and the edge of the target object along a cardinal direction.

transformations:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify the background color of the input grid.
  - step: 2
    action: Identify all distinct red_objects in the input grid.
  - step: 3
    action: For each red_object:
      sub_step: 3a
      action: Search outwards from the red_object in each of the four cardinal_directions.
      details: The search path must stay within the row(s) or column(s) occupied by the red object.
      sub_step: 3b
      action: Find the closest target_object in each direction. Record its distance.
      details: If multiple objects are found in one direction, only the closest one counts for that direction.
      sub_step: 3c
      action: Compare the distances found in the four directions.
      sub_step: 3d
      condition: If a single, unique minimum distance is found among the four directions:
        action_1: Identify the path of background cells between the red_object and the unique closest target_object.
        action_2: Change the color of the pixels in this path to white (color 0) in the output grid.
      condition: Otherwise (no target_object found in any direction, or a tie for the minimum distance):
        action: Do nothing related to white paths for this red_object.
  - step: 4
    action: Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
  - step: 5
    action: Apply the white path changes identified in step 3d (action_2) to the output grid.
  - step: 6
    action: Change the color of all pixels corresponding to the original red_objects to the background_color in the output grid.

output_grid_properties:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - The output grid contains the original non-red, non-background objects.
  - The output grid contains the background color where the input had background color or red pixels (unless replaced by white).
  - The output grid may contain new white pixels (color 0) forming lines between original red object locations and other objects.
