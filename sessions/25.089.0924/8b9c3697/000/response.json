These seem to be the primary actors initiating the transformation. They can appear as single pixels or contiguous blocks/shapes.\n4.  **Other Objects:** Other non-background colors form distinct objects (blue=1, azure=8, yellow=4 on green background).\n5.  **Transformation Output:** The main difference in the output grids is the appearance of white pixels (color 0) and the disappearance of the original red pixels. The original red pixels are replaced by the background color. The white pixels appear in specific paths related to the original red pixels.\n6.  **Path Creation:** The white pixels form straight lines (horizontal or vertical) originating from the *vicinity* of where a red pixel/object was in the input. These paths extend towards another non-background object.\n7.  **Condition for Path:** A path of white pixels is created only if a red pixel/object has a *unique closest* non-background object located directly horizontal or vertical to it. The path fills the space *between* the red object's original location and the target object. If no such unique closest object exists (either no object found or a tie in distance in opposite directions), no white path is created.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
