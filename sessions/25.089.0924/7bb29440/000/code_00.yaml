perception:
  background_color: white (0)
  objects:
    - type: primary_shape
      color: blue (1)
      connectivity: contiguous (including diagonals for pixel membership definition, but shapes themselves are separated by background)
      properties:
        - contains_pixels:
            - yellow (4)
            - magenta (6)
        - bounding_box: defines the extent of the shape
        - pixel_count: total number of non-background pixels within the shape
        - magenta_count: count of magenta (6) pixels within the shape
        - yellow_count: count of yellow (4) pixels within the shape
        - area: calculated from bounding_box dimensions or pixel_count
        - top_row_index: the minimum row index of any pixel in the shape
  relationships:
    - multiple primary_shape objects exist in the input grid, separated by the background_color.
  actions:
    - identify: find all distinct primary_shape objects in the input.
    - analyze: for each primary_shape object, count the occurrences of magenta (6) and yellow (4) pixels, determine its area, and find its top_row_index.
    - select: choose the primary_shape object based on the following criteria, applied sequentially:
        1. Maximum magenta_count.
        2. If tied, minimum yellow_count.
        3. If still tied, maximum area (pixel_count).
        4. If still tied, maximum top_row_index (lowest object visually).
    - extract: create a new grid containing only the selected primary_shape object, cropped to its bounding box.
    - modify: within the extracted grid, change all yellow (4) pixels to blue (1).
    - output: the modified, extracted grid.
