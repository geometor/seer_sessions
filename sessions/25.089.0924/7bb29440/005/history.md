## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain a white (0) background with multiple distinct objects composed primarily of blue (1) pixels. These blue objects are often rectangular or L-shaped but can vary.
2.  **Embedded Colors:** Within these blue objects, there are often single pixels of yellow (4) and magenta (6). Some blue objects may contain multiple instances of these colors, while others might contain none or only one type.
3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is always a single, solid object, primarily blue (1), sometimes containing magenta (6) pixels, but never yellow (4). The output grid dimensions are smaller than the input and match the bounding box of the selected object from the input.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves selecting *one* of the blue objects from the input grid and producing it as the output.
5.  **Selection Criteria:** The key seems to be the presence and count of magenta (6) pixels within the blue objects. In each example, the blue object that appears in the output is the one containing the *most* magenta (6) pixels in the input. If there's a tie in the magenta count (or if no object has magenta), the specific selection rule needs further clarification, but the provided examples seem to have a unique object with the maximum magenta count. *Correction: In train\_4, two objects have two magenta pixels. However, one object has yellow pixels and the other does not. The output corresponds to the object *without* yellow pixels in this tie-breaker case. Let's re-examine. No, that's not right. Rereading train\_4: The top-right object has (1,4), (1,6), (1,6), (1,4). The bottom-right object has (1,6), (1,6), (1,4). The bottom-left object has (1,4), (1,4), (1,6). The middle-left object has (1,4), (1,4), (1,6). The object selected for output is the bottom-right one (6x3 rectangle), containing two 6s and one 4. Let's count 6s in others: top-right has two 6s, bottom-left has one 6, middle-left has one 6. So, there's a tie between top-right and bottom-right based *only* on the count of 6s. Let's count 4s: top-right has two 4s, bottom-right has one 4. The one with fewer 4s is selected in the tie? Let's check other examples. Train 2: Top-left object has one 6, two 4s. Bottom-right object has one 6, two 4s. Middle-right object has one 6, one 4. The middle-right is selected (fewest 4s among those tied for max 6s). Train 3: Top-left: two 6s, three 4s. Top-right: two 6s, two 4s. Bottom-left: three 6s, two 4s. Bottom-middle: two 6s, two 4s. Bottom-right: one 6, three 4s. The one with the most 6s (bottom-left) is selected. Train 5: Top-left: two 6s, two 4s. Top-middle: three 6s, two 4s. Top-right: one 6, one 4. Bottom-middle: three 6s, two 4s. Bottom-right: two 6s, two 4s. There's a tie between top-middle and bottom-middle for max 6s (three each). Both also have two 4s. How is the tie broken? Let's look at the objects themselves. Top-middle is 6x4. Bottom-middle is 8x4. The output is 8x4, corresponding to the bottom-middle object. So, if counts of 6s and 4s are tied, the larger object (by area? by height? by width?) is selected. Bottom-middle has area 32, top-middle has area 24. Seems like the larger area wins in a tie. Train 4 tie-breaker check: Top-right (6x3, area 18) vs Bottom-right (6x3, area 18). Areas are the same. Let's re-examine the pixels. Top-right object pixels: (2,6) to (6,11). Bottom-right object pixels: (11,9) to (16,14). The output corresponds to the bottom-right object. Is it the lower one? Or the rightmost one? In Train 5, the winner (bottom-middle) is lower than the other tied object (top-middle). So, the tie-breaker might be: largest area, then lowest top row index.
6.  **Color Modification:** After selecting the object, any yellow (4) pixels within its bounds are changed to blue (1). Magenta (6) pixels remain unchanged. All original blue (1) pixels also remain.

## Facts


```yaml
perception:
  background_color: white (0)
  objects:
    - type: primary_shape
      color: blue (1)
      connectivity: contiguous (including diagonals for pixel membership definition, but shapes themselves are separated by background)
      properties:
        - contains_pixels:
            - yellow (4)
            - magenta (6)
        - bounding_box: defines the extent of the shape
        - pixel_count: total number of non-background pixels within the shape
        - magenta_count: count of magenta (6) pixels within the shape
        - yellow_count: count of yellow (4) pixels within the shape
        - area: calculated from bounding_box dimensions or pixel_count
        - top_row_index: the minimum row index of any pixel in the shape
  relationships:
    - multiple primary_shape objects exist in the input grid, separated by the background_color.
  actions:
    - identify: find all distinct primary_shape objects in the input.
    - analyze: for each primary_shape object, count the occurrences of magenta (6) and yellow (4) pixels, determine its area, and find its top_row_index.
    - select: choose the primary_shape object based on the following criteria, applied sequentially:
        1. Maximum magenta_count.
        2. If tied, minimum yellow_count.
        3. If still tied, maximum area (pixel_count).
        4. If still tied, maximum top_row_index (lowest object visually).
    - extract: create a new grid containing only the selected primary_shape object, cropped to its bounding box.
    - modify: within the extracted grid, change all yellow (4) pixels to blue (1).
    - output: the modified, extracted grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels in the input grid. Consider pixels connected orthogonally or diagonally as part of the same object if they are not white. Filter these to keep only objects that contain at least one blue (1) pixel (these are the primary shapes).
2.  For each primary shape identified:
    a.  Count the number of magenta (6) pixels it contains.
    b.  Count the number of yellow (4) pixels it contains.
    c.  Calculate its area (total number of non-white pixels belonging to it).
    d.  Determine the topmost row index occupied by any of its pixels.
3.  Select the target primary shape using the following priority:
    a.  The shape with the highest count of magenta (6) pixels.
    b.  If there is a tie in magenta count, select from the tied shapes the one with the lowest count of yellow (4) pixels.
    c.  If there is still a tie, select from the tied shapes the one with the largest area (pixel count).
    d.  If there is still a tie, select from the tied shapes the one that appears lowest in the grid (i.e., has the largest topmost row index).
4.  Determine the bounding box of the selected target shape.
5.  Create a new output grid with the dimensions of the bounding box.
6.  Copy the pixels of the selected target shape from the input grid into the new output grid, maintaining their relative positions within the bounding box.
7.  Iterate through the pixels of the new output grid. If a pixel is yellow (4), change its color to blue (1). Leave all other pixels (blue (1) and magenta (6)) unchanged.
8.  The resulting grid is the final output.

Identify all distinct contiguous objects in the input grid composed of non-white (0) pixels, considering pixels connected orthogonally and diagonally (8-way connectivity). Filter this set to include only objects that contain at least one blue (1) pixel.
For each identified object:
    a. Count the total number of magenta (6) pixels it contains (magenta_count).

Select the target object using the following priority sequence:

Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices (bounding box) of the selected target object.
Create a new output grid whose dimensions match the height and width of the bounding box.
Copy each pixel belonging to the selected target object from the input grid into the new output grid, preserving its original color and adjusting its position relative to the top-left corner of the bounding box.
The resulting grid is the final output.

Okay, the code execution reveals critical errors in my previous analysis:

1.  **Connectivity:** My `find_objects_diag` function was flawed. The selection results (e.g., Train 3 selecting the 4x4 object at (11,0)) are clearly wrong based on visual inspection. The object selected *should* have been the one starting at row 8, col 5, which has 3 magenta and 2 yellow. The code selected an object with 3 magenta and 1 yellow. Let me re-examine Train 3's input... Ah, the object at (11,0) *does* have 3 magenta (at (11,3), (13,3), (14,6)) and 1 yellow (at (13,1)). The tool code seems to find the objects correctly based on 8-way connectivity, but my initial manual analysis missed how the objects connected diagonally.
2.  **Selection:** The selection criteria (Max Magenta -> Min Yellow -> Max Area -> Max Top Row) correctly identified the object based on the tool code's findings in all examples.
    *   Train 3: Selected (M=3, Y=1, A=16, TR=11) over (M=3, Y=2, ...) - Correct based on criteria.
    *   Train 4: Selected (M=2, Y=1, A=30, TR=11) over (M=2, Y=2, ...) - Correct based on criteria.
    *   Train 5: Selected (M=4, Y=2, A=80, TR=11) as it has the unique max magenta count - Correct based on criteria.
3.  **Output Generation:** The crucial mistake is in generating the output. The previous code *replaced yellow with blue*. However, comparing the selected object's representation (as printed by the tool code's `output_grid_np`) with the expected output shows they are different even before the yellow->blue change.
    *   Train 3: Selected obj (4x4) vs Expected (4x5). They are completely different shapes/content.
    *   Train 4: Selected obj (5x6) vs Expected (7x5). Different shapes/content.
    *   Train 5: Selected obj (8x10) vs Expected (5x5). Different shapes/content.

**Revised Hypothesis:** The output is not simply the selected object with yellow changed to blue. There must be another transformation step, or the selection criteria are different, or the *definition* of the object being extracted is different.

Let's reconsider the examples where the code failed, focusing on the *expected* output and trying to find it within the input, potentially related to the "selected" object based on M/Y/A/TR criteria.

*   **Train 3:**
    *   Selected Object (according to M/Y/A/TR): The 4x4 object starting at (11,0). M=3, Y=1.
    *   Expected Output: 4x5 grid. Let's scan the input for this 4x5 pattern.
        
```
        1 1 1 1 4  <- Input Row 15, Cols 14-18 (relative)
        1 4 1 1 1  <- Input Row 16, Cols 14-18
        1 1 1 6 1  <- Input Row 17, Cols 14-18
        1 1 1 1 1  <- Input Row 18, Cols 14-18
        ```

        This 4x5 block exists in the input! It's the object starting at (14, 14). Let's analyze *this* object's M/Y/A/TR: M=1, Y=2, A=20, TR=14. This object was ranked 5th by the M/Y/A/TR criteria. Why was *it* chosen?

*   **Train 4:**
    *   Selected Object (M/Y/A/TR): The 5x6 object starting at (11,9). M=2, Y=1.
    *   Expected Output: 7x5 grid. Scanning the input...
        
```
        1 1 1 1 1 <- Input Row 6, Cols 0-4
        1 1 1 1 1 <- Input Row 7, Cols 0-4
        1 4 1 1 1 <- Input Row 8, Cols 0-4
        1 1 1 1 1 <- Input Row 9, Cols 0-4
        1 1 4 1 1 <- Input Row 10, Cols 0-4
        1 1 1 1 1 <- Input Row 11, Cols 0-4
        1 1 1 1 1 <- Input Row 12, Cols 0-4 (partially) No, this doesn't quite fit.
        ```

        Let's re-examine the expected output and the object at (6,0):
        Object at (6,0): M=1, Y=2, A=40, TR=6, H=11, W=5.
        Expected Output: Height 7, Width 5. Contains the top part of the object at (6,0). Why only the top 7 rows?
        The object selected by M/Y/A/TR (at 11,9) had M=2, Y=1. The object at (6,0) had M=1, Y=2. Neither matches the selection criteria if the output corresponds directly to the selected object.

*   **Train 5:**
    *   Selected Object (M/Y/A/TR): The 8x10 object starting at (11,2). M=4, Y=2.
    *   Expected Output: 5x5 grid. Scanning...
        
```
        1 1 1 1 1 <- Input Row 5, Cols 13-17
        1 1 1 1 1 <- Input Row 6, Cols 13-17
        1 6 1 1 1 <- Input Row 7, Cols 13-17
        1 1 1 4 1 <- Input Row 8, Cols 13-17
        1 1 1 1 1 <- Input Row 9, Cols 13-17
        ```

        This 5x5 block exists! It's the object starting at (5, 13). Let's analyze it: M=1, Y=1, A=25, TR=5. The M/Y/A/TR selected object had M=4. Again, a mismatch.

**New Insight:** The selection criteria (Max M -> Min Y -> Max A -> Max TR) might not be selecting the object *to be outputted*. Perhaps it selects a *reference* object, and the actual output object is determined *relative* to this reference object? Or maybe the criteria are completely different.

Let's revisit the core idea: Select *one* object. Produce *that* object as output, changing yellow to blue. This worked for Train 1 & 2. Why did it fail later?

What if the connectivity rule is wrong? What if objects are defined only by blue (1) pixels, and the yellow (4) and magenta (6) are just properties *within* or *adjacent* to the blue shapes?

Let's redefine "object" = contiguous block of **blue (1)** pixels (using 8-way connectivity). Then, for each blue object, find associated yellow/magenta pixels.

Re-evaluating Train 3 with "blue object" focus:
- Blue object 1 (top-left): Rows 1-6, cols 1-8. Associated: M=(2,5), (5,8); Y=(2,7), (3,3), (4,4). Counts: M=2, Y=3. Area=48 (blue only?). TopRow=1.
- Blue object 2 (top-right): Rows 2-7, cols 12-18. Associated: M=(3,14), (7,13); Y=(5,15), (8,16). Counts: M=2, Y=2. Area=48. TopRow=2.
- Blue object 3 (middle-left): Rows 8-18, cols 5-10 & row 11-14 col 0. This seems complicated. Let's focus on the clear rectangular part: Rows 8-10, cols 5-10 (Area 18). Associated: M=(9,6), (10,9). Y=(12,8), (15,9). Let's use the previous tool's object definition (all non-white connected) as it seems more robust.

Let's stick to the original object definition (all connected non-white, containing blue) and the M/Y/A/TR selection criteria, as it worked for 2/5 examples and yielded consistent selections. The problem lies in mapping the *selected* object to the *output* object.

Could the output be a *subgrid* of the selected object?
*   Train 3: Selected (11,0), 4x4. Expected 4x5 (from (14,14)). No obvious relation.
*   Train 4: Selected (11,9), 5x6. Expected 7x5 (from (6,0)). No obvious relation.
*   Train 5: Selected (11,2), 8x10. Expected 5x5 (from (5,13)). No obvious relation.

This is confusing. Let's reconsider the simplest examples.
*   Train 1: Input has 2 objects.
    *   Obj 1 (top-left): (1,1) to (3,4). M=0, Y=2, A=11, TR=1. BBox 3x4.
    *   Obj 2 (bottom-right): (6,4) to (9,9). M=1, Y=0, A=23, TR=6. BBox 4x6.
    *   Selection: Obj 2 (Max M=1).
    *   Output: 4x6 grid matching Obj 2's bounding box. Yellows (none) converted to blue (no change). -> Matches expected output.
*   Train 2: Input has 3 objects.
    *   Obj 1 (top-left): (2,2) to (6,7). M=2, Y=2, A=30, TR=2. BBox 5x6.
    *   Obj 2 (middle-right): (4,11) to (10,15). M=2, Y=1, A=29, TR=4. BBox 7x5.
    *   Obj 3 (bottom-left): (11,2) to (18,8). M=2, Y=3, A=59, TR=11. BBox 8x7.
    *   Selection: M=2 tie between 1, 2, 3. Y=1 minimum for Obj 2. Select Obj 2.
    *   Output: 7x5 grid matching Obj 2's bounding box. Yellow (9,14) converted to blue. -> Matches expected output.

The rule "Select object via M/Y/A/TR, extract bounding box, copy pixels, convert Y->B" worked perfectly for Train 1 & 2. Why does it fail for 3, 4, 5?

Let's look *only* at the objects that *correspond* to the outputs in the failed examples:
*   Train 3 Output Object (at 14,14): M=1, Y=2, A=20, TR=14, H=5, W=5.
*   Train 4 Output Object (at 6,0): M=1, Y=2, A=40, TR=6, H=11, W=5.
*   Train 5 Output Object (at 5,13): M=1, Y=1, A=25, TR=5, H=5, W=5.

Is there a *different* selection rule that picks *these* objects?
- Max Magenta? No (Train 3 selected M=3, output M=1; Train 5 selected M=4, output M=1).
- Min Yellow? No (Train 3 output Y=2, selected Y=1; Train 4 output Y=2, selected Y=1).
- Max Area? No (Train 3 output A=20, selected A=16; Train 4 output A=40, selected A=30; Train 5 output A=25, selected A=80).
- Max TR? No (Train 3 output TR=14, selected TR=11; Train 4 output TR=6, selected TR=11; Train 5 output TR=5, selected TR=11).

This implies either my object identification/analysis is wrong, or the relationship between input and output is more complex than simply selecting *one* object based on fixed properties and copying it.

What if the properties are relative? E.g., select the object with the highest ratio of M/(M+Y)?
- Train 1: Obj1 M=0, Y=2 -> 0. Obj2 M=1, Y=0 -> 1. Select Obj2. Correct.
- Train 2: Obj1 M=2, Y=2 -> 0.5. Obj2 M=2, Y=1 -> 0.66. Obj3 M=2, Y=3 -> 0.4. Select Obj2. Correct.
- Train 3: Obj(11,0) M=3, Y=1 -> 0.75. Obj(8,5) M=3, Y=2 -> 0.6. Obj(2,12) M=2, Y=2 -> 0.5. Obj(1,1) M=2, Y=3 -> 0.4. Obj(14,14) M=1, Y=2 -> 0.33. Obj(19,10) M=1, Y=3 -> 0.25. Selects Obj(11,0). Incorrect mapping to output.
- Train 4: Obj(2,6) M=2, Y=2 -> 0.5. Obj(11,9) M=2, Y=1 -> 0.66. Obj(6,0) M=1, Y=2 -> 0.33. Obj(16,0) M=1, Y=2 -> 0.33. Obj(19,4) M=2, Y=3 -> 0.4. Selects Obj(11,9). Incorrect mapping to output.
- Train 5: Obj(1,1) M=2, Y=2 -> 0.5. Obj(2,6) M=4, Y=2 -> 0.66. Obj(5,13) M=1, Y=1 -> 0.5. Obj(11,2) M=4, Y=2 -> 0.66. Obj(12,14) M=2, Y=2 -> 0.5. Tie between Obj(2,6) and Obj(11,2). Need tie-breaker. Let's use Max Area: Obj(11,2) A=80, Obj(2,6) A=32. Selects Obj(11,2). Incorrect mapping to output.

The ratio idea doesn't work either.

Could the connectivity be only orthogonal? Let's re-run the tool code with orthogonal connectivity.
