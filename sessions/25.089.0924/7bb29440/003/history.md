## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain a white (0) background with multiple distinct objects composed primarily of blue (1) pixels. These blue objects are often rectangular or L-shaped but can vary.
2.  **Embedded Colors:** Within these blue objects, there are often single pixels of yellow (4) and magenta (6). Some blue objects may contain multiple instances of these colors, while others might contain none or only one type.
3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is always a single, solid object, primarily blue (1), sometimes containing magenta (6) pixels, but never yellow (4). The output grid dimensions are smaller than the input and match the bounding box of the selected object from the input.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves selecting *one* of the blue objects from the input grid and producing it as the output.
5.  **Selection Criteria:** The key seems to be the presence and count of magenta (6) pixels within the blue objects. In each example, the blue object that appears in the output is the one containing the *most* magenta (6) pixels in the input. If there's a tie in the magenta count (or if no object has magenta), the specific selection rule needs further clarification, but the provided examples seem to have a unique object with the maximum magenta count. *Correction: In train\_4, two objects have two magenta pixels. However, one object has yellow pixels and the other does not. The output corresponds to the object *without* yellow pixels in this tie-breaker case. Let's re-examine. No, that's not right. Rereading train\_4: The top-right object has (1,4), (1,6), (1,6), (1,4). The bottom-right object has (1,6), (1,6), (1,4). The bottom-left object has (1,4), (1,4), (1,6). The middle-left object has (1,4), (1,4), (1,6). The object selected for output is the bottom-right one (6x3 rectangle), containing two 6s and one 4. Let's count 6s in others: top-right has two 6s, bottom-left has one 6, middle-left has one 6. So, there's a tie between top-right and bottom-right based *only* on the count of 6s. Let's count 4s: top-right has two 4s, bottom-right has one 4. The one with fewer 4s is selected in the tie? Let's check other examples. Train 2: Top-left object has one 6, two 4s. Bottom-right object has one 6, two 4s. Middle-right object has one 6, one 4. The middle-right is selected (fewest 4s among those tied for max 6s). Train 3: Top-left: two 6s, three 4s. Top-right: two 6s, two 4s. Bottom-left: three 6s, two 4s. Bottom-middle: two 6s, two 4s. Bottom-right: one 6, three 4s. The one with the most 6s (bottom-left) is selected. Train 5: Top-left: two 6s, two 4s. Top-middle: three 6s, two 4s. Top-right: one 6, one 4. Bottom-middle: three 6s, two 4s. Bottom-right: two 6s, two 4s. There's a tie between top-middle and bottom-middle for max 6s (three each). Both also have two 4s. How is the tie broken? Let's look at the objects themselves. Top-middle is 6x4. Bottom-middle is 8x4. The output is 8x4, corresponding to the bottom-middle object. So, if counts of 6s and 4s are tied, the larger object (by area? by height? by width?) is selected. Bottom-middle has area 32, top-middle has area 24. Seems like the larger area wins in a tie. Train 4 tie-breaker check: Top-right (6x3, area 18) vs Bottom-right (6x3, area 18). Areas are the same. Let's re-examine the pixels. Top-right object pixels: (2,6) to (6,11). Bottom-right object pixels: (11,9) to (16,14). The output corresponds to the bottom-right object. Is it the lower one? Or the rightmost one? In Train 5, the winner (bottom-middle) is lower than the other tied object (top-middle). So, the tie-breaker might be: largest area, then lowest top row index.
6.  **Color Modification:** After selecting the object, any yellow (4) pixels within its bounds are changed to blue (1). Magenta (6) pixels remain unchanged. All original blue (1) pixels also remain.

## Facts


```yaml
perception:
  background_color: white (0)
  objects:
    - type: primary_shape
      color: blue (1)
      connectivity: contiguous (including diagonals for pixel membership definition, but shapes themselves are separated by background)
      properties:
        - contains_pixels:
            - yellow (4)
            - magenta (6)
        - bounding_box: defines the extent of the shape
        - pixel_count: total number of non-background pixels within the shape
        - magenta_count: count of magenta (6) pixels within the shape
        - yellow_count: count of yellow (4) pixels within the shape
        - area: calculated from bounding_box dimensions or pixel_count
        - top_row_index: the minimum row index of any pixel in the shape
  relationships:
    - multiple primary_shape objects exist in the input grid, separated by the background_color.
  actions:
    - identify: find all distinct primary_shape objects in the input.
    - analyze: for each primary_shape object, count the occurrences of magenta (6) and yellow (4) pixels, determine its area, and find its top_row_index.
    - select: choose the primary_shape object based on the following criteria, applied sequentially:
        1. Maximum magenta_count.
        2. If tied, minimum yellow_count.
        3. If still tied, maximum area (pixel_count).
        4. If still tied, maximum top_row_index (lowest object visually).
    - extract: create a new grid containing only the selected primary_shape object, cropped to its bounding box.
    - modify: within the extracted grid, change all yellow (4) pixels to blue (1).
    - output: the modified, extracted grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels in the input grid. Consider pixels connected orthogonally or diagonally as part of the same object if they are not white. Filter these to keep only objects that contain at least one blue (1) pixel (these are the primary shapes).
2.  For each primary shape identified:
    a.  Count the number of magenta (6) pixels it contains.
    b.  Count the number of yellow (4) pixels it contains.
    c.  Calculate its area (total number of non-white pixels belonging to it).
    d.  Determine the topmost row index occupied by any of its pixels.
3.  Select the target primary shape using the following priority:
    a.  The shape with the highest count of magenta (6) pixels.
    b.  If there is a tie in magenta count, select from the tied shapes the one with the lowest count of yellow (4) pixels.
    c.  If there is still a tie, select from the tied shapes the one with the largest area (pixel count).
    d.  If there is still a tie, select from the tied shapes the one that appears lowest in the grid (i.e., has the largest topmost row index).
4.  Determine the bounding box of the selected target shape.
5.  Create a new output grid with the dimensions of the bounding box.
6.  Copy the pixels of the selected target shape from the input grid into the new output grid, maintaining their relative positions within the bounding box.
7.  Iterate through the pixels of the new output grid. If a pixel is yellow (4), change its color to blue (1). Leave all other pixels (blue (1) and magenta (6)) unchanged.
8.  The resulting grid is the final output.

"""
Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels (colors 1-9) in the input grid, considering orthogonal adjacency.
Filter these objects to keep only those containing at least one blue (1) pixel.
For each filtered object, calculate:
1. Count of magenta (6) pixels.
2. Count of yellow (4) pixels.
3. Area (total count of non-white pixels in the object).
4. Topmost row index.
Select the object based on the following criteria, applied sequentially:
1. Maximum magenta count.
2. Minimum yellow count (among ties for max magenta).
3. Maximum area (among ties for yellow count).
4. Maximum topmost row index (lowest object visually, among ties for area).
Extract the selected object based on its bounding box.
Create an output grid matching the bounding box size.
Copy the pixels of the selected object into the output grid.
Replace any yellow (4) pixels in the output grid with blue (1) pixels.
Return the final output grid.

        *   Object 4: M=3, Y=1, A=16, TR=11
    *   The one with Min Yellow (1) is Object 4. So the code selected this object.
    *   Let's find the bounding box and content of Object 4: Pixels start at (11,0), (12,0), (13,0)... Looks like it's the L-shape at the bottom left.
        *   Pixels are roughly rows 11-17, cols 0-4. Dimensions approx 7x5?
        *   Let's check the expected output: size 4x5.
        
```
        1 1 1 1 4  -> Yellow=1, Magenta=1
        1 4 1 1 1
        1 1 1 6 1
        1 1 1 1 1
        ```

    *   The expected output has M=1, Y=2. This doesn't match *any* of the objects directly.
    *   Let's re-read the task description and priors. "Objects persist". "contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same color". My `find_objects` function groups *all* non-background colors together contiguously. Is an "object" defined differently? Maybe an object is only the blue pixels, and the 4s and 6s are *markers* on those blue objects?
    *   Let's reconsider Example 1.
        *   Top-left Blue Shape: Contains (1,4) Yellow and (2,2) Yellow.
        *   Bottom-right Blue Shape: Contains (8,6) Magenta.
        *   Selection: Pick the blue shape associated with the most Magentas. That's the bottom-right one. Extract *that blue shape* and any markers *inside its bounding box*? No, that doesn't seem right.
    *   What if the "object" whose properties we count is defined by the *blue* pixels only?
    *   Let's redefine "object" = a contiguous group of blue (1) pixels.
    *   Then, for each such blue object, count the number of adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally?) non-blue, non-background pixels (specifically 4 and 6).

**Revised Object Definition and Analysis Plan:**

1.  Find all contiguous groups of **blue (1)** pixels. These are the core objects.
2.  For each blue object:
    a.  Find all **magenta (6)** pixels that are adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to *any* pixel of this blue object. Count them.
    b.  Find all **yellow (4)** pixels that are adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to *any* pixel of this blue object. Count them.
    c.  Determine the bounding box containing *only the blue pixels* of the object. Calculate its area (count of blue pixels).
    d.  Determine the topmost row index of *any blue pixel* in the object.
3.  Select the **blue object** based on:
    a.  Max associated magenta count.
    b.  Min associated yellow count.
    c.  Max blue pixel area.
    d.  Max top row index (lowest object).
4.  Extract the **shape defined by the original input pixels within the bounding box of the selected blue object**.
5.  No color modification.

Let's re-test this logic on Example 3 mentally.
*   Blue Object 1 (top-left, rows 1-6, cols 1-8): Adjacent M=2 ( (2,5), (5,8) ), Adjacent Y=3 ( (2,7), (3,3), (4,5) ). Area = 48 blue pixels. TopRow=1.
*   Blue Object 2 (top-right, rows 2-7, cols 12-17): Adjacent M=2 ( (3,14), (7,13) ), Adjacent Y=2 ( (5,15), (8,16) ). Area = 48 blue pixels. TopRow=2.
*   Blue Object 3 (middle-left, rows 8-18, cols 5-10 except white): Adjacent M=3 ( (9,6), (10,9), (14,6) ), Adjacent Y=2 ( (12,8), (15,9) ). Area = 60 blue pixels? TopRow=8.
*   Blue Object 4 (bottom-left, rows 11-17, cols 0-3): Adjacent M=3 ( (11,3), (13,3), (16,3) - Wait, these are inside the L-shape, not just adjacent). Okay, adjacent *or overlapping*. Let's redefine: Count 4s and 6s within the bounding box of the blue object? No, that's too broad. Count 4s and 6s that are *part of the originally identified multi-color object*?
    *   Let's stick to the original `find_objects` that groups all non-white together. But maybe the properties calculation is wrong.
    *   Go back to the tool output for Example 3:
        *   Object 1: M=2, Y=3, A=48, TR=1
        *   Object 2: M=3, Y=2, A=60, TR=2 (Rows 8-17, Cols 5-10 area)
        *   Object 3: M=3, Y=2, A=60, TR=8 (Rows 2-8, Cols 12-18 area)
        *   Object 4: M=3, Y=1, A=16, TR=11 (Rows 11-17, Cols 0-4 area, L-shape)
        *   Object 5: M=1, Y=2, A=20, TR=14 (Rows 14-18, Cols 14-18 area)
        *   Object 6: M=1, Y=3, A=30, TR=19 (Rows 19-21, Cols 10-19 area)
    *   Selection picks Object 4: M=3, Y=1, A=16, TR=11. Bounding box is rows 11-17, cols 0-4 (7x5). Let's extract this from the input:
        
```
        . . . 6 .
        6 1 1 1 .
        1 4 1 6 .
        1 1 1 1 .
        . . . . . # This pixel is (14,4)=0 in input
        . . . . . # This pixel is (15,4)=0 in input
        . . 6 . . # This pixel is (16,2)=6 in input, rest are 1s or 0s
        ```

        My `find_objects` uses orthogonal connectivity. Let's re-run using diagonal as well for finding objects initially? No, the problem description usually implies orthogonal unless stated otherwise. Sticking to orthogonal for finding objects.

    *   The extracted object for #4 doesn't look like the output. What object *does* look like the output (4x5, M=1, Y=2)?
        *   Output:
            
```
            1 1 1 1 4
            1 4 1 1 1
            1 1 1 6 1
            1 1 1 1 1
            ```

        *   Could it be Object 5? M=1, Y=2, A=20, TR=14. Pixels are roughly rows 14-18, cols 14-18. Let's extract:
            Input section:
            
```
            . . . 1 1 1 1 4 .
            . . . 1 4 1 1 1 .
            . . . 1 1 1 6 1 .
            . . . 1 1 1 1 1 .
            ```

            Bounding box looks like rows 14-17, cols 14-18. That's 4x5. This matches the output size and content exactly!
    *   Why was Object 5 selected? It has M=1, Y=2. Object 4 had M=3, Y=1. Object 2 and 3 had M=3, Y=2. My selection criteria (Max M -> Min Y -> Max A -> Max TR) picked Object 4.
    *   What if the criteria are different? Max M -> **Max Y** -> Max A -> Max TR?
        *   Max M = 3 (Objects 2, 3, 4)
        *   Max Y among these = 2 (Objects 2, 3)
        *   Max A among these = 60 (Objects 2, 3)
        *   Max TR among these = 8 (Object 3) -> Selects Object 3. Output should be 7x7 (rows 8-14, cols 5-11 approx). Incorrect.
    *   What if it's Min M -> ...? No, example 1 needs Max M.
    *   What if Area is primary? Max A -> Max M -> Min Y -> Max TR?
        *   Max A = 60 (Objects 2, 3)
        *   Max M among these = 3 (Objects 2, 3)
        *   Min Y among these = 2 (Objects 2, 3)
        *   Max TR among these = 8 (Object 3) -> Selects Object 3. Incorrect.
    *   Could the object definition be the issue? What if objects are defined by color 6? Find all 6s, find the object (contiguous non-white) containing it?
    *   Let's reconsider the initial perception. Select the object with the most 6s. If tie, select the one with the fewest 4s. If tie, select the one with largest area. If tie, select the lowest one (max top row). And DO NOT change colors 4->1. Just extract.
        *   Ex 1: Obj1 M=0, Obj2 M=1. Select Obj2. Correct. Output matches Obj2 exactly.
        *   Ex 2: Obj1 M=2, Obj2 M=1, Obj3 M=1. Select Obj1. Code output was based on this, but failed because it changed 4->1. With correction, output should be:
            
```
            1 1 1 1 1 4
            1 4 1 1 1 1
            1 1 1 1 6 1
            1 1 6 1 1 1
            1 1 1 1 1 1
            ```

           Bounding box: rows 2-6, cols 2-7 (5x6). Expected output is 3x5. Why?
            
```
            1 4 1 1 1
            1 1 1 6 1
            6 1 1 1 1
            ```

           This expected output corresponds to Object 3 (M=1, Y=1, A=15, TR=4). Why was Object 3 selected? It doesn't have max M.
    *   This is confusing. Let's look at the *outputs*. What is common? They are always rectangular and seem "solid" - i.e., the bounding box of the output pixels is fully filled with non-background colors. The inputs have complex shapes.
    *   Hypothesis: Find the "marker" pixels (4 and 6). Find the largest "solid rectangle" of blue (1) pixels that contains the marker pixel(s) that win according to some criteria.
    *   Let's refine:
        1. Identify all *individual* Magenta (6) and Yellow (4) pixels. These are "sites".
        2. For each site, find the largest solid rectangle of Blue (1) pixels containing it. (How? Find all blue pixels, then look for maximal rectangles within them? Or, expand outwards from the site?) This seems complex.
    *   Alternative Hypothesis: Look at the structure around 6s and 4s.
        *   In Example 1 output: The 6 is surrounded by 1s in a 4x6 rectangle. In the input, this 6 was part of a larger blue shape.
        *   In Example 2 output: M=1, Y=1. In the input, the winning object (Object 3) had M=1, Y=1. Bounding box was rows 4-9, cols 11-15 (6x5). The output is 3x5. Where does it come from?
            Input Object 3:
            
```
            . 1 1 1 1 1 .
            . 1 1 1 1 1 .
            . 1 1 6 1 1 .
            . 1 1 1 1 1 .
            . 1 1 1 4 1 .
            . 1 6 1 1 1 .
            . 1 1 1 1 1 .
            ```

            Output:
            
```
            1 4 1 1 1
            1 1 1 6 1
            6 1 1 1 1
            ```

           This output doesn't seem to be a direct subgrid or simple transformation.

    *   Let's reconsider the first analysis of Example 1. Top object M=0, Y=2. Bottom object M=1, Y=0. The bottom one is selected. Its content *is* the output.
    *   Example 2: Obj1 (TopLeft) M=2, Y=2. Obj2 (MidRight) M=1, Y=1. Obj3 (BotRight) M=1, Y=2. Obj4 (BigLeft) M=2, Y=3. (Using tool output properties).
        *   Max M = 2 (Obj1, Obj4)
        *   Min Y = 2 (Obj1)
        *   Selection: Obj1. Bounding Box: rows 2-6, cols 2-7 (5x6). Content:
            
```
            1 1 1 1 1 4
            1 4 1 1 1 1
            1 1 1 1 6 1
            1 1 6 1 1 1
            1 1 1 1 1 1
            ```

        *   Expected output: 3x5, M=1, Y=1. This *still* points to Object 2 (MidRight, M=1, Y=1, A=15, TR=4). Why would Object 2 be selected over Object 1? Object 1 wins on Max M.

    *   Is it possible the selection criteria depend on the *output* grid somehow? No, that makes no sense.
    *   Could adjacency be diagonal? Let's re-run `find_objects` with diagonal connectivity.

**Resolution:**

1.  **Connectivity:** Using diagonal connectivity (`find_objects_diag`) correctly identifies the objects that correspond to the outputs. In Example 2, the selected object (M=2, Y=1, A=15, TR=16) perfectly matches the expected output when extracted. In Example 3, the selection logic (Max M -> Min Y -> ...) still picks the wrong object (Object 4: M=3, Y=1). However, if we manually look for the object matching the output's properties (M=1, Y=2), we find Object 5 (M=1, Y=2, A=20, TR=14) whose extracted content matches the expected output exactly.
2.  **Selection Criteria Failure:** The selection criteria (Max M -> Min Y -> Max A -> Max TR) work for examples 1, 2 (with diag), 4 (with diag, presumably), 5 (with diag, presumably), but *not* for example 3. In example 3, it selects Object 4 (M=3, Y=1) while the correct output corresponds to Object 5 (M=1, Y=2). This means the selection criteria are not universally applicable or are different/more complex.
3.  **Color Transformation:** The initial mistake of changing Yellow (4) to Blue (1) is definitely wrong. The correct approach is to extract the selected object's pixels exactly as they are.
4.  **Revisiting Example 3 Selection:** Why is Object 5 (M=1, Y=2, A=20, TR=14) chosen over Object 4 (M=3, Y=1, A=16, TR=11) or Objects 2/3 (M=3, Y=2, A=60)? There's no simple priority order based on M, Y, A, TR that selects Object 5 here while still selecting correctly for Example 1 (Max M) and Example 2 (Max M -> Min Y).
5.  **Possible New Criterion:** Could the number of *blue* pixels specifically matter?
    *   Ex 3, Obj 4: A=16. Blue count? ~12?
    *   Ex 3, Obj 5: A=20. Blue count? ~17?
    *   Ex 3, Obj 2/3: A=60. Blue count? ~55?
    *   What if the selection is based on a combined score? Or maybe proximity of markers? Or geometric properties (e.g., "most rectangular object")?
    *   Let's stick to the simplest approach that works for most: Max M -> Min Y -> Max A -> Max TR, using Diagonal Connectivity, and extracting the object as-is. This seems the most likely path, acknowledging it doesn't work for Example 3, which might be an outlier or require a more nuanced rule. The coder phase might need to handle Example 3 as a special case or refine the selection further if the test case fails.

**Final Strategy:**

*   Use 8-way (diagonal) connectivity to find contiguous non-background objects containing at least one blue pixel.
*   Calculate M, Y, Area (total non-background pixels), and Top Row for each object.
*   Select using Max M -> Min Y -> Max A -> Max TR.
*   Extract the selected object based on its bounding box, keeping original colors.

## General Assessment

The initial code failed primarily due to two reasons:
1.  An incorrect assumption about color transformation (changing yellow to blue), derived only from the first example. Examples 2-5 clearly show that original colors within the selected object are preserved.
2.  Using orthogonal connectivity (`find_objects`) instead of diagonal connectivity (`find_objects_diag`) for identifying the objects. The tool code execution shows that using diagonal connectivity correctly identifies the objects and their properties leading to the expected output for Example 2.
3.  A potential issue remains with the selection criteria, as the established priority (Max M -> Min Y -> Max A -> Max TR) selects the correct object for Examples 1 and 2 (diag), but not for Example 3 (diag), where it selects an object with M=3, Y=1, while the expected output corresponds to an object with M=1, Y=2. However, given it works for the majority, we will proceed with these criteria, noting the discrepancy in Example 3.

The strategy is to correct the color transformation rule (no changes) and use diagonal connectivity for object identification, applying the established selection criteria.

## Metrics

Based on the `tool_code` execution using **diagonal connectivity**:

*   **Example 1 (Mental Check):**
    *   Object 1 (TopLeft): M=0, Y=2, Area=?, TR=?
    *   Object 2 (BotRight): M=1, Y=0, Area=?, TR=?
    *   Selection: Max M -> Object 2. Matches expected output.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Found 4 objects.
    *   Properties:
        *   Obj1: M=2, Y=2, A=30, TR=2
        *   Obj2: M=2, Y=2, A=50, TR=4
        *   Obj3: M=2, Y=3, A=56, TR=11
        *   Obj4: M=2, Y=1, A=15, TR=16
    *   Selection (Max M -> Min Y -> Max A -> Max TR): Object 4 (M=2, Y=1).
    *   Extracted content of Object 4 matches the expected output (3x5 grid).
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Found 6 objects.
    *   Properties:
        *   Obj1: M=2, Y=3, A=48, TR=1
        *   Obj2: M=3, Y=2, A=60, TR=2
        *   Obj3: M=3, Y=2, A=60, TR=8
        *   Obj4: M=3, Y=1, A=16, TR=11
        *   Obj5: M=1, Y=2, A=20, TR=14
        *   Obj6: M=1, Y=3, A=30, TR=19
    *   Selection (Max M -> Min Y -> Max A -> Max TR): Object 4 (M=3, Y=1).
    *   Expected Output (4x5 grid) corresponds to the content of Object 5 (M=1, Y=2). The selection criteria fail for this example.
*   **Example 4 (Tool Output - Orthogonal):**
    *   Obj1: M=2, Y=2, A=30, TR=2
    *   Obj2: M=0, Y=2, A=35, TR=6
    *   Obj3: M=2, Y=1, A=30, TR=11
    *   Obj4: M=1, Y=2, A=15, TR=14
    *   Obj5: M=2, Y=3, A=24, TR=19
    *   Selection (Orthogonal): Object 3 (M=2, Y=1, A=30, TR=11).
    *   Expected Output: 7x5 grid. Let's check bounding box of Object 3 (Orthogonal): rows 11-16, cols 9-14 (6x6). Doesn't match size. Likely needs diagonal check.
*   **Example 5 (Tool Output - Orthogonal):**
    *   Obj1: M=2, Y=1, A=9, TR=1
    *   Obj2: M=3, Y=1, A=30, TR=2
    *   Obj3: M=1, Y=1, A=25, TR=5
    *   Obj4: M=2, Y=1, A=9, TR=6
    *   Obj5: M=4, Y=2, A=80, TR=11
    *   Obj6: M=2, Y=1, A=16, TR=12
    *   Selection (Orthogonal): Object 5 (M=4, Y=2, A=80, TR=11).
    *   Expected Output: 5x5 grid. Let's check bounding box of Object 5 (Orthogonal): rows 11-18, cols 2-11 (8x10). Doesn't match size. Likely needs diagonal check.

**Conclusion from Metrics:** Using diagonal connectivity and the selection criteria (Max M -> Min Y -> Max A -> Max TR) works for Examples 1 & 2. It fails for Example 3. Examples 4 & 5 likely also require diagonal connectivity for correct object segmentation/property calculation, after which the selection criteria *might* work (though Example 3 shows it's not guaranteed). The color transformation is definitely just extraction.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects in the input grid composed of non-white (0) pixels, considering pixels connected orthogonally and diagonally (8-way connectivity). Filter this set to include only objects that contain at least one blue (1) pixel.
2.  For each identified object:
    a.  Count the total number of magenta (6) pixels it contains (`magenta_count`).
    b.  Count the total number of yellow (4) pixels it contains (`yellow_count`).
    c.  Calculate its total area by counting all its non-white pixels (`area`).
    d.  Determine the topmost row index occupied by any of its pixels (`top_row_index`).
3.  Select the target object using the following priority sequence:
    a.  The object with the highest `magenta_count`.
    b.  If there's a tie, select from the tied objects the one with the lowest `yellow_count`.
    c.  If there's still a tie, select from the tied objects the one with the largest `area`.
    d.  If there's still a tie, select from the tied objects the one that appears lowest in the grid (i.e., has the largest `top_row_index`).
4.  Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices (bounding box) of the selected target object.
5.  Create a new output grid whose dimensions match the height and width of the bounding box.
6.  Copy each pixel belonging to the selected target object from the input grid into the new output grid, preserving its original color and adjusting its position relative to the top-left corner of the bounding box.
7.  The resulting grid is the final output.
