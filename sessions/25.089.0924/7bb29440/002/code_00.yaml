perception:
  background_color: white (0)
  objects:
    - type: composite_shape
      description: Contiguous regions of non-background pixels (connected orthogonally and diagonally) containing at least one blue (1) pixel.
      connectivity: 8-way (orthogonal and diagonal)
      properties:
        - pixel_members: list of (row, col, color) tuples
        - contains_blue: must be true
        - magenta_count: count of magenta (6) pixels within the shape
        - yellow_count: count of yellow (4) pixels within the shape
        - area: total number of non-background pixels in the shape (pixel_members count)
        - top_row_index: the minimum row index of any pixel in the shape
        - bounding_box: (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) encompassing all pixel_members
  relationships:
    - Multiple composite_shape objects can exist in the input grid, separated by the background_color.
  actions:
    - identify: find all distinct composite_shape objects in the input using 8-way connectivity.
    - analyze: for each composite_shape object, calculate its magenta_count, yellow_count, area, and top_row_index.
    - select: choose the composite_shape object based on the following criteria, applied sequentially:
        1. Maximum magenta_count.
        2. If tied, minimum yellow_count.
        3. If still tied, maximum area.
        4. If still tied, maximum top_row_index (lowest object visually).
    - extract: determine the bounding_box of the selected composite_shape object.
    - create_output: create a new grid with dimensions matching the bounding_box size.
    - populate_output: copy the pixels from the selected composite_shape object (pixel_members) into the new output grid, adjusting coordinates relative to the bounding_box top-left corner. Preserve the original colors of the pixels.
    - output: the populated output grid.
