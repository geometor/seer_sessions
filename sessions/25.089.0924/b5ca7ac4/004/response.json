            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation mechanism: dividing the grid into 9 regions (a 3x3 grid) and permuting the content of these regions. However, the specific permutation map derived from the first example was incorrect, leading to failures on all training examples. The incorrect map was: `{(0, 0): (0, 0), (0, 1): (0, 2), (0, 2): (1, 0), (1, 0): (1, 1), (1, 1): (1, 2), (1, 2): (2, 1), (2, 0): (2, 2), (2, 1): (2, 0), (2, 2): (0, 1)}`. The errors show that the content of input regions was consistently placed in the wrong output regions according to the expected outputs. The strategy is to re-analyze the input->output region mapping across all examples to find the *correct*, consistent permutation map. The grid dimensions and the method of dividing into regions appear sound.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    We can verify the grid dimensions and calculate the region boundary indices for the examples. All examples use a 22x22 grid.\n"
