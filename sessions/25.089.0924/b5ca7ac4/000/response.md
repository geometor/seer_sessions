*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids have the same dimensions (22x22 in all examples).
    *   The grids contain a background color (White in example 1, Yellow in example 2, Blue in example 3) and several distinct "objects".
    *   These objects typically consist of a 5x5 square shape with a solid border color (often Azure or Red) and a 3x3 inner core of a different color.
    *   The objects are scattered across the grid, but their placement suggests an underlying 3x3 structure.
    *   Comparing input and output grids, the objects appear to have been rearranged, while the background color remains unchanged.
    *   The rearrangement doesn't seem to be a simple rotation or flip. It looks like the grid is conceptually divided into 9 regions (a 3x3 grid), and the entire content of these regions is permuted according to a fixed rule.
    *   By dividing the 22x22 grid into nine roughly equal rectangular regions (approximated by dividing height and width by 3) and tracking the content of each region from input to output, a consistent permutation map emerges across all examples.

*   **YAML Facts:**

task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions: Consistent between input and output.
    - background_color: Persists from input to output. Varies between examples (White, Yellow, Blue).
  elements:
    - type: regions
      description: The grid is conceptually divided into a 3x3 grid of 9 roughly equal rectangular regions.
      properties:
        - size: Determined by dividing the input grid's height and width by 3. Let H, W be input dimensions. Region row boundaries are roughly at 0, H/3, 2H/3, H. Region column boundaries are roughly at 0, W/3, 2W/3, W.
        - content: Each region contains a subgrid of pixels from the input grid, which might include parts of objects or just background color.
  transformation:
    type: region_permutation
    description: The content of the 9 input regions is copied to 9 output regions according to a fixed permutation map.

    output_grid:
      - dimensions: Same as input.
      - content: Constructed by placing the permuted region contents into their new locations.

*   **Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the dimensions (Height H, Width W) of the input grid.
2.  Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions H x W.
3.  Calculate the row division points: `r1 = H // 3`, `r2 = 2 * H // 3`.
4.  Calculate the column division points: `c1 = W // 3`, `c2 = 2 * W // 3`.
5.  Define the 9 regions in the input grid based on these division points:
    *   Region (1,1): rows 0 to `r1`-1, cols 0 to `c1`-1
    *   Region (1,2): rows 0 to `r1`-1, cols `c1` to `c2`-1
    *   Region (1,3): rows 0 to `r1`-1, cols `c2` to W-1
    *   Region (2,1): rows `r1` to `r2`-1, cols 0 to `c1`-1
    *   Region (2,2): rows `r1` to `r2`-1, cols `c1` to `c2`-1
    *   Region (2,3): rows `r1` to `r2`-1, cols `c2` to W-1
    *   Region (3,1): rows `r2` to H-1, cols 0 to `c1`-1
    *   Region (3,2): rows `r2` to H-1, cols `c1` to `c2`-1
    *   Region (3,3): rows `r2` to H-1, cols `c2` to W-1
6.  Define the corresponding 9 regions in the output grid using the same row and column boundaries.
7.  Copy the pixel content from each input region to the corresponding output region according to the following fixed permutation map (Input Region -> Output Region):
    *   Input (1,1) -> Output (1,1)
    *   Input (1,2) -> Output (1,3)
    *   Input (1,3) -> Output (2,1)
    *   Input (2,1) -> Output (2,2)
    *   Input (2,2) -> Output (2,3)
    *   Input (2,3) -> Output (3,2)
    *   Input (3,1) -> Output (3,3)
    *   Input (3,2) -> Output (3,1)
    *   Input (3,3) -> Output (1,2)
8.  Return the completed output grid.
