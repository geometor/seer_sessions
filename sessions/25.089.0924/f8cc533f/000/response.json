Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n    3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid that has the background color.\n    4.  For each background pixel, check if it is enclosed within a hollow rectangular frame of a single non-background color. This check can be performed by verifying if there exists a path consisting solely of pixels of a single non-background color 'C' from the current background pixel position outwards in the up, down, left, and right directions, eventually reaching pixels of color 'C' in all four directions.\n    5.  If a background pixel is found to be enclosed by a frame of color 'C' according to the check in step 4, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to color 'C'.\n    6.  Pixels that are not part of the background or are background pixels not enclosed by a frame retain their original color in the output grid.\n    7.  Return the modified output grid."
