Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the background color (the most frequent color in the grid).
2. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3. Find all connected components (regions) of pixels that have the background color, using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right).
4. For each background color component:
    a. Determine the set of all neighboring pixels (pixels adjacent via 4-connectivity to any pixel in the component, but not part of the component itself).
    b. Check if the component touches the grid boundary (any pixel in the first/last row or first/last column).
    c. Collect the colors of all non-background neighboring pixels.
    d. If the component does *not* touch the grid boundary AND all its non-background neighbors have the *same* single color 'C', then fill all pixels belonging to this component in the output grid with color 'C'.
5. Pixels not belonging to such fillable background components retain their original color.
6. Return the modified output grid.
