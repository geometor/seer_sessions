For each such column:\n    a. Determine the unique non-background colors present.\n    b. Count the number of pixels (N) for each color in that column.\n    c. Find the topmost row index for each color in that column.\n    d. Sort these colors based on their topmost row index in descending order (lowest appears first).\n3. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0).\n4. For each processed column, starting from the bottom row of the output grid:\n    a. Iterate through the sorted colors for that column.\n    b. For each color and its count N:\n        i. Calculate the triangle's base width: W = 2 * ceil(sqrt(N)) - 1.\n        ii. Calculate the triangle's height: H = (W + 1) / 2.\n        iii. Draw an upward-pointing triangle of that color, centered horizontally on the column index, with its base of width W positioned on the current designated base row.\n    c.
