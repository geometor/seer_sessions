            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions.\n2.  **Background:** The background is consistently white (0).\n3.  **Significant Pixels:** Non-white pixels appear in the input, primarily clustered within single columns in the examples. Multiple colors can exist within the same column (Example 3).\n4.  **Transformation:** The non-white pixels in the input seem to \"condense\" or \"precipitate\" into triangle shapes at the bottom of the output grid.\n5.  **Positional Correlation:** The horizontal position (column index) of the input pixels dictates the horizontal center of the output triangles.\n6.  **Color Preservation:** The colors present in an input column are preserved in the output triangles corresponding to that column.\n7.  **Shape Generation:** The output shapes are always triangles pointing upwards, with a flat base. The base width is always odd (1, 3, 5, ...).\n8.  **Size Determination:** The size (specifically, the base width) of each colored triangle in the output appears to be determined by the *number* of pixels of that color found in the corresponding input column.\n9.  **Vertical Ordering:** When multiple colors exist in an input column (Example 3), their relative vertical positions in the input determine the vertical stacking order of the *bases* of their corresponding triangles in the output. The color appearing lowest in the input column forms the triangle whose base is on the bottom-most row of the output grid. Subsequent colors (moving up the input column) form triangles whose bases are placed on successively higher rows.\n10. **Pixel Count vs. Triangle Size:** The number of pixels (`N`) of a specific color in an input column determines the base width (`W`) of the output triangle using the formula `W = 2 * ceil(sqrt(N)) - 1`. The height (`H`) of the triangle is then `H = (W+1)/2`. The total number of pixels in the generated output triangle (`H*H`) might differ from the input count `N` if `N` is not a perfect square.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
