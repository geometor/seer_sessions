task_description: Transform input grid by collecting colored pixels from columns and forming corresponding triangles at the bottom of the output grid.

elements:
  - element: grid
    attributes:
      - height
      - width
      - background_color: white (0)

  - element: pixel_group
    description: Contiguous or non-contiguous set of pixels of the same non-white color within a single column in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: (e.g., orange, yellow, magenta)
      - column_index: The column where the pixels reside.
      - count: (N) The number of pixels in the group for that column.
      - vertical_order: The relative vertical position compared to other colors in the same column (e.g., lowest, middle, highest based on first appearance from top).

  - element: triangle
    description: Output shape generated for each input pixel_group. Pointing upwards.
    properties:
      - color: Same as the corresponding input pixel_group.
      - center_column: Same as the column_index of the input pixel_group.
      - base_width: (W) Determined by the input count N -> W = 2 * ceil(sqrt(N)) - 1.
      - height: (H) Determined by the base_width W -> H = (W+1)/2.
      - pixel_count: H * H.
      - base_row: The row index where the triangle's base is located. Determined by the vertical_order of the corresponding input pixel_group relative to other colors in the same column, starting from the grid's bottom row.

actions:
  - action: identify_columns
    description: Find all unique column indices that contain at least one non-white pixel in the input grid.
  - action: analyze_column
    description: For each identified column, determine the distinct colors present, count the pixels (N) for each color, and establish their vertical order.
  - action: calculate_triangle_params
    description: For each color within a column, calculate its output triangle's base width (W) and height (H) based on its pixel count (N).
  - action: generate_output_grid
    description: Create an empty grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
  - action: draw_triangles
    description: For each column analyzed, draw the calculated triangles onto the output grid. The triangles are centered on the column index. Their bases are placed on consecutive rows starting from the bottom row of the grid, following the inverse vertical order of the colors found in the input column (lowest input color gets base on bottom row).

relationships:
  - relationship: input_column_to_output_center
    description: The column index of non-white pixels in the input determines the horizontal center of the corresponding output triangles.
  - relationship: input_count_to_output_size
    description: The number of pixels (N) of a color in an input column determines the base width (W) and height (H) of the corresponding output triangle.
  - relationship: input_vertical_order_to_output_stacking
    description: The relative vertical position of colors within an input column determines the row placement of the bases of the corresponding output triangles, starting from the bottom.
