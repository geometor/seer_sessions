task_elements:
  - Input Grid: A 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Output Grid: A smaller 2D array of pixels.
  - Divider Lines: Solid horizontal and vertical lines of a single, consistent color within each input grid.
  - Divider Color: The specific color used for the divider lines (e.g., green=3, azure=8, gray=5).
  - Cells: Rectangular subgrids formed by the divider lines. All cells within a given input have the same dimensions.
  - Background Color: White (0), typically ignored in frequency counts.
  - Content Colors: Other colors present within the cells.

properties:
  - Grid Dimensions: Height and width of input and output grids.
  - Cell Dimensions: Height and width of the cells created by dividers. Matches output grid dimensions.
  - Divider Locations: Row and column indices of the divider lines.
  - Color Frequencies: Counts of each non-divider, non-background color within the cells.
  - Most Frequent Color: The content color with the highest frequency count.
  - Cell Color Counts: The count of the 'Most Frequent Color' within each individual cell.

actions:
  - Identify Divider Color: Find the color forming solid lines.
  - Partition Grid: Mentally or algorithmically divide the input grid into cells based on divider lines.
  - Calculate Frequencies: Count occurrences of relevant colors globally (within cells).
  - Determine Target Color: Identify the most frequent relevant color.
  - Count Target Color per Cell: Count instances of the target color in each cell.
  - Select Cell: Choose the cell with the maximum count of the target color, using top-left tie-breaking if needed.
  - Extract Cell Content: Copy the pixel values from the selected cell.
  - Generate Output: Create the output grid using the extracted cell content.

relationships:
  - Input-Output Size: Output grid dimensions are determined by the cell dimensions derived from the input grid's divider structure.
  - Cell Selection Rule: The selection of the specific cell to output is based on maximizing the count of the globally most frequent (non-divider, non-background) color within that cell.
