The content of this cell matches the output.\n\n*   **Tie-breaking:** In `train_3`, cell (0,3) was the only one with the maximum count (4) of the most frequent color (yellow). If there were multiple cells with the maximum count, a tie-breaker would be needed. Common ARC tie-breakers include: top-most, then left-most cell. Let's assume that for now.\n\n*   **Summary of Logic:**\n    1.  Identify the divider color: This is the color forming solid horizontal and vertical lines that span the grid.\n    2.  Identify the divider lines (rows and columns).\n    3.  Determine the dimensions of the cells created by these dividers. The output grid will have these dimensions.\n    4.  Count the frequency of all non-white, non-divider colors within the cells (excluding the divider lines themselves).\n    5.  Find the color(s) with the highest frequency (the \"target color\").\n    6.  For each cell in the grid partition, count how many pixels of the target color it contains.\n    7.  Select the cell that contains the maximum number of target color pixels.\n    8.  If there's a tie (multiple cells have the same maximum count), select the cell that comes first in reading order (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).\n    9.  The output grid is the content of the selected cell.\n\n*   This seems like a robust explanation covering all three examples.**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The input is a large grid, and the output is a smaller grid. The size of the output grid seems related to a structure within the input.\n2.  **Dividers:** Each input grid features a specific color that forms solid horizontal and vertical lines, acting as dividers. In train_1, it's green (3); in train_2, it's azure (8); in train_3, it's gray (5).\n3.  **Grid Partitioning:** These divider lines partition the input grid into a set of smaller, equally sized rectangular cells (excluding the dividers themselves).\n4.  **Cell Size and Output Size:** The dimensions of these smaller cells in the input grid exactly match the dimensions of the output grid. For train_1 and train_2, the cells are 5x5, and the output is 5x5. For train_3, the cells are 3x3, and the output is 3x3.\n5.  **Cell Selection:** The core task seems to be selecting *one* specific cell from the partitioned input grid and making its content the output grid.\n6.  **Selection Criterion:** The selection appears based on color frequency. The process involves:\n    *   Ignoring the divider color and the background color (white, 0).\n    *   Finding the color that appears most frequently across all the cells in the input grid partition.\n    *   Identifying the cell(s) containing the highest number of pixels of this most frequent color.\n    *   If multiple cells tie for the highest count, a tie-breaker (likely top-most, then left-most) is used.\n7.  **Output Generation:** The content of the selected cell becomes the output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Examine the input grid to identify the single color that forms continuous, solid horizontal and vertical lines spanning the grid; this is the 'divider color'. Record the row indices of horizontal lines and column indices of vertical lines.\n2.  Determine the dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) of the rectangular cells formed by these divider lines (these dimensions will be the dimensions of the output grid).\n3.  Create a frequency map (or count) of all colors present in the input grid, *excluding* the background color (white, 0) and the 'divider color', and only considering pixels that are *not* part of the divider lines themselves.\n4.  Identify the color that has the highest frequency in the map created in step 3. This is the 'target color'. (If multiple colors tie for the highest frequency, a separate tie-breaking rule might be needed, but the examples suggest a unique maximum exists).\n5.  Iterate through each cell defined by the divider lines (identified in step 1). For each cell, count the number of pixels that match the 'target color'.\n6.  Find the cell(s) that contain the maximum count of the 'target color' pixels.\n7.  If only one cell has the maximum count, select that cell.\n8.
