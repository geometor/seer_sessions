"""
The transformation identifies horizontal and vertical lines of a single, consistent 'divider color' that partition the input grid into smaller, equally sized cells. It then calculates the frequency of all other non-background (non-white) colors within these cells (excluding the divider lines themselves). The color with the highest frequency globally across all cells becomes the 'target color'. Finally, it identifies the cell containing the highest number of pixels of the 'target color'. If multiple cells tie for the highest count, the top-most, then left-most cell is chosen. The content of this selected cell becomes the output grid.
