    *   The grids contain a background color (orange, 7).
    *   Scattered foreground pixels are mostly azure (8) and occasionally maroon (9).
    *   The azure (8) pixels often form distinct vertical line segments (contiguous blocks of azure pixels in a single column).

    *   The transformation involves removing the input maroon block and creating a new maroon block by replacing some azure pixels from one of the vertical azure line segments.
