Okay, let's analyze the failures and refine the approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the primary conditional structures (Vertical Red Line vs. Azure presence, and MFC within Azure cases). However, the specific transformations applied within each condition were inaccurate in several examples.

*   Example 1 (MFC Blue): The transformation applied to the largest blue object was incorrect. The code simply recolored the pixels of the object, but the expected output shows a different shape, suggesting a more complex geometric transformation or shape replacement based on the object's properties.
*   Example 2 (MFC Magenta): The base color swaps were partially correct, but the "row duplication" effect was applied incorrectly. It seems this effect should be based on the state *after* the initial color swaps, not on the original input grid.
*   Example 3 (MFC Yellow): The transformations `Yellow -> Red` and `Blue -> Orange` were misinterpreted as complex block/pair operations. The actual transformation appears to be a direct pixel-wise replacement.
*   Example 4 (Red Line): The rule application was mostly correct, but the area to the right of the transformed line should have been cleared (set to white), not preserved from the input.

**Strategy:**

1.  Correct the specific transformation rules for each conditional case based on the discrepancies observed between the actual and expected outputs.
2.  Pay close attention to the order of operations, especially in the MFC Magenta case (swaps first, then row effect).
3.  Simplify rules where overcomplication occurred (MFC Yellow).
4.  Ensure background clearing/initialization is handled correctly (Red Line case, potentially others).
5.  Re-evaluate the MFC Blue case. The transformation is unclear. For now, I will stick to the interpretation "Find the largest Blue object (8-way), create a white grid, draw that object's shape in Red", acknowledging it didn't match Example 1's expected output, but it's the most direct interpretation of the other examples' complexity levels. If this continues to fail, a different hypothesis for MFC Blue is needed.

**Metrics & Analysis:**

Let's re-examine the counts and properties for clarity.
