Okay, the largest contiguous block of yellow (4) is 10x10, starting at (6, 3). The output is 10x9.
The bounding box grid extracted is:

```
[[8 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
 [3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
 [1 4 4 1 4 4 4 4 4 4]
 [6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
 [1 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
 [3 4 4 4 4 4 4 1 4 4]
 [2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
 [4 4 4 4 4 1 4 4 4 4]
 [6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
 [1 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]]
```

The output is:

```
[[4 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 4]
 [4 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 4]
 [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
 [4 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 4]
 [4 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 4]
 [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
 [4 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 4]
 [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
 [4 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 4]
 [4 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 4]]
```

It seems the transformation focuses *only* on the yellow (4) and blue (1) pixels within the bounding box of the largest yellow object. Other colors are ignored.
Let's map the input bounding box to the output:
- Output rows correspond directly to input rows (10 rows).
- Output columns: 9 columns. Input bounding box columns: 10 columns. Which column is dropped?
- Look at the pattern:
  - Output rows 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9: pattern `4 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 4`
  - Output rows 2, 5, 7: pattern `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1` (all blue)
- The input bounding box has blue (1) pixels at (row 8, col 6), (row 11, col 10), (row 13, col 8). Using 0-based indexing relative to the bounding box: (2, 3), (5, 7), (7, 5).
- Let's create a grid containing only 1s and 4s from the bounding box, replacing others with a placeholder (e.g., 0):

```
[[0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
 [0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
 [1 4 4 1 4 4 4 4 4 4]  <- Input row index 2
 [0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
 [1 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
 [0 4 4 4 4 4 4 1 4 4]  <- Input row index 5
 [0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
 [0 4 4 4 4 1 4 4 4 4]  <- Input row index 7
 [0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
 [1 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]]
```

- Compare this filtered input with the output:
  - Output rows 2, 5, 7 are all blue (1). In the filtered input, rows 2, 5, 7 contain at least one blue (1) pixel. This suggests: if a row in the bounding box (considering only 1s and 4s) contains *any* blue (1) pixel, the corresponding output row becomes all blue (1).
  - The other output rows have the pattern `4 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 4`. These correspond to input rows that *only* contain yellow (4) (ignoring other colors).
  - Where does the `4 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 4` pattern come from? It's a fixed pattern, 9 columns wide. It doesn't seem to depend on the specific content of the yellow-only input rows.
  - It also doesn't seem to depend on the *position* of the blue pixels in the "blue-containing" rows.
  - The output grid size is 10x9. The input bounding box is 10x10. The pattern `4 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 4` is 9 wide. This suggests the output width is fixed at 9.

Hypothesis 1:
1. Find the largest contiguous block of yellow (4) pixels.
2. Determine its bounding box.
3. Create an output grid with the same height as the bounding box and a fixed width of 9.
4. Iterate through each row of the bounding box:
   a. Check if the row contains any blue (1) pixels.
   b. If yes, fill the corresponding output row entirely with blue (1).
   c. If no, fill the corresponding output row with the fixed pattern `[4, 4, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 4, 4]`.

**Train 2 Analysis:**
*   **Input:** 17x23 grid. Central area with blue (1) pixels.
*   **Output:** 7x6 grid. Pattern of blue (1) and red (2).
*   Let's find the largest object of the most frequent color in the central area (blue).

The bounding box of the largest blue object is 8x6. The output is 7x6.
Input BBox:

```
[[9 1 7 6 9 6]  <- row 0
 [1 1 1 1 1 1]  <- row 1
 [1 1 1 1 1 1]  <- row 2

 [1 1 1 1 1 1]  <- row 6

 [2 2 2 2 2 2]  <- row 4 (all red)

- Output height is 7, input bbox height is 8. Row 0 of bbox `[9 1 7 6 9 6]` seems ignored. It's the only row not consisting mainly of blue (1). Maybe we extract the bounding box *after* filtering for the primary color? No, that doesn't make sense. Let's assume row 0 is dropped.
- Rows 3 and 5 in the (8x6) bbox contain red (2).
- Rows 2 and 4 in the (7x6) output are all red (2).
- This aligns if we ignore the first row of the bounding box. So, input row `i+1` maps to output row `i`.
- Input row 3 (relative to bbox start, which is row 5 in original grid) contains red. Output row 2 is all red. `2 = 3 - 1`.
- Input row 5 (relative to bbox start, which is row 7 in original grid) contains red. Output row 4 is all red. `4 = 5 - 1`.
- It seems the rule is: find the bounding box of the largest blue (1) object. Ignore the first row of this bounding box. For the remaining rows, if a row contains *any* red (2) pixel, the corresponding output row becomes all red (2). Otherwise, the output row becomes a fixed pattern `[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]`.

Hypothesis 2 (refining Hypothesis 1):
1. Identify the "primary" color: the color forming the largest contiguous block in the input grid (Yellow=4 in ex1, Blue=1 in ex2).
2. Identify the "secondary" color: the color used to fill rows in the output (Blue=1 in ex1, Red=2 in ex2).
3. Identify the "pattern" color: the other color used in the output pattern rows (Yellow=4 in ex1, Blue=1 in ex2). Note: in ex1 pattern color = primary color; in ex2 pattern color != primary color.
4. Identify the "fixed pattern": the repeating pattern used for some output rows (`[4, 4, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 4, 4]` in ex1, `[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]` in ex2).
5. Find the bounding box of the largest contiguous block of the primary color.
6. Determine the output grid dimensions:
   - Height: Bounding box height, potentially minus 1 (as seen in ex2).
   - Width: Width of the fixed pattern.
7. Create the output grid.
8. Iterate through the rows of the bounding box (possibly skipping the first row):
   a. Check if the row contains any pixel of the secondary color.
   b. If yes, fill the corresponding output row entirely with the secondary color.
   c. If no, fill the corresponding output row with the fixed pattern.

**Train 3 Analysis:**
*   **Input:** 16x17 grid. Large block of gray (8) pixels.
*   **Output:** 6x8 grid. Pattern of gray (8) and red (2).
*   Primary color seems to be gray (8). Secondary color seems to be red (2). Pattern color is gray (8).
