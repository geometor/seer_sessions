The background color is assumed to be 7 (Orange).\nCounts the number of objects of color A and color B that have bounding boxes with both odd height and odd width.\nDetermines a 'target_color' and a 'replacement_color' based on these counts:\n- If one color has more odd-dimensioned objects, it becomes the target_color, and the other becomes the replacement_color.\n- If the counts are equal, the color with the higher numerical value becomes the target_color, and the lower becomes the replacement_color.\nCreates an output grid initially as a copy of the input grid.\nIterates through the input grid:\n- Replaces all pixels of the replacement_color in the output grid with the background color (7).\nIdentifies all objects of the target_color in the input grid.\nFor each target_color object:\n- Calculates its bounding box.\n- If the bounding box has both odd height and odd width:\n    - Finds the center pixel of the bounding box.\n    - Changes the color of this center pixel in the output grid to the replacement_color.\nReturns the modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all connected objects of a specific color in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n        color (int): The color of the objects to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of sets, where each set contains the (row, col) tuples\n              of the pixels belonging to one object.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and not visited[r, c]:\n                obj_pixels = set()\n                queue = [(r, c)]\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                while queue:\n                    row, col = queue.pop(0)\n                    obj_pixels.add((row, col))\n                    # Check neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            queue.append((nr, nc))\n                if obj_pixels:\n                    objects.append(obj_pixels)\n    return objects\n\ndef get_bounding_box(obj_pixels):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bounding box for a set of object pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        obj_pixels (set): A set of (row, col) tuples.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) or None if empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not obj_pixels:\n        return None\n    rows = [r for r, c in obj_pixels]\n    cols = [c for r, c in obj_pixels]\n    return min(rows), min(cols), max(rows), max(cols)\n\ndef get_dimensions(bounding_box):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the height and width from a bounding box.\n\n    Args:\n        bounding_box (tuple): (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (height, width).\n    \"\"\"\n    min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c = bounding_box\n    height = max_r -
