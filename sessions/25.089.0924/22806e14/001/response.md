"""
Identifies two non-background colors (A and B) in the input grid. The background color is assumed to be 7 (Orange).
Counts the number of objects of color A and color B that have bounding boxes with both odd height and odd width.
Determines a 'target_color' and a 'replacement_color' based on these counts:
- If one color has more odd-dimensioned objects, it becomes the target_color, and the other becomes the replacement_color.
- If the counts are equal, the color with the higher numerical value becomes the target_color, and the lower becomes the replacement_color.
Creates an output grid initially as a copy of the input grid.
Iterates through the input grid:
- Replaces all pixels of the replacement_color in the output grid with the background color (7).
Identifies all objects of the target_color in the input grid.
For each target_color object:
- Calculates its bounding box.
- If the bounding box has both odd height and odd width:
    - Finds the center pixel of the bounding box.
    - Changes the color of this center pixel in the output grid to the replacement_color.
Returns the modified output grid.
