Input_Grid: A 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
Output_Grid: A 2D array derived from the input grid.
Background_Color: 7 (Orange), assumed constant across examples.
Non_Background_Colors: Exactly two distinct colors present in the input grid besides the background color. Let these be Color A and Color B.

Objects:
  - Definition: Contiguous areas (sharing sides, not just corners) of the same non-background color.
  - Properties:
      - Color: The color of the pixels comprising the object.
      - Pixels: A set of (row, column) coordinates belonging to the object.
      - Bounding_Box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all object pixels (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
      - Dimensions: Height and Width calculated from the bounding box (height = max_row - min_row + 1, width = max_col - min_col + 1).
      - Is_Odd_Odd: Boolean indicating if both Height and Width are odd numbers.
      - Center_Pixel: If Is_Odd_Odd is True, the coordinate (min_row + height // 2, min_col + width // 2).

Color_Roles:
  - Based on comparing Color A and Color B.
  - Count_Odd_Odd(Color): The number of objects of that Color where Is_Odd_Odd is True.
  - Role_Determination:
      - countA = Count_Odd_Odd(Color A)
      - countB = Count_Odd_Odd(Color B)
      - IF countA > countB THEN Target_Color = Color A, Replacement_Color = Color B
      - ELSE IF countB > countA THEN Target_Color = Color B, Replacement_Color = Color A
      - ELSE (countA == countB) THEN Target_Color = max(Color A, Color B), Replacement_Color = min(Color A, Color B)

Transformation_Rules:
  - Rule 1 (Object Removal): Find all objects composed solely of the Replacement_Color. For each such object, change all its constituent pixels in the output grid to the Background_Color.
  - Rule 2 (Center Modification): Find all objects composed solely of the Target_Color. For each such object:
      - IF its Is_Odd_Odd property is True:
          - Determine its Center_Pixel coordinate.
          - Change the color of the pixel at the Center_Pixel coordinate in the output grid to the Replacement_Color.
  - Rule 3 (Stasis): All pixels not affected by Rule 1 or Rule 2 retain their original color from the input grid. (This is implicitly handled by initializing the output as a copy and only applying specific changes).
