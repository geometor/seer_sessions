The background color is consistently orange (7).\n2.  **Color Palette:** Each example uses exactly three colors: the orange (7) background and two other distinct colors.\n    *   Example 1: Orange (7), Azure (8), Maroon (9)\n    *   Example 2: Orange (7), Azure (8), Blue (1)\n    *   Example 3: Orange (7), Blue (1), Green (3)\n3.  **Objects:** The non-background colors form distinct connected objects (pixels of the same color adjacent horizontally or vertically).\n4.  **Transformations:** The transformation involves modifying some objects and removing others.\n    *   **Modification:** Some objects have their single center pixel changed to a different color. This only seems to happen to objects whose bounding box has both odd height and odd width.\n    *   **Removal:** Entire objects of one specific color are removed (replaced by the background orange color).\n    *   **Stasis:** Some objects remain completely unchanged. These appear to be objects targeted for modification but lacking a unique center (i.e., having at least one even dimension in their bounding box), or background pixels.\n5.  **Color Roles:** In each example, one non-background color acts as the 'target' for modification, and the other acts as the 'replacement' color (used for the center pixel modification) and is also the color of objects that get removed entirely.\n6.  **Determining Roles:** The key seems to be identifying which color is the 'target' and which is the 'replacement'. Comparing the examples suggests a rule based on the properties of the objects of each color:\n    *   Count how many objects of each non-background color have a bounding box with odd height *and* odd width.\n    *   The color with *more* such objects is the `target_color`. Its objects (if they have odd dimensions) get their center pixel changed to the `replacement_color`.\n    *   The color with *fewer* such objects is the `replacement_color`. All objects of this color are removed.\n    *   If the counts are equal, the color with the higher numerical value appears to be the `target_color`, and the lower is the `replacement_color`.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify all connected objects of non-background colors (colors other than 7) in the input grid.\n3.  Determine the two unique non-background colors present, call them `Color A` and `Color B`.\n4.  For each object, determine its bounding box and check if both its height and width are odd.\n5.  Count the number of `Color A` objects with odd height and odd width (`countA`).\n6.  Count the number of `Color B` objects with odd height and odd width (`countB`).\n7.  Assign the `target_color` and `replacement_color` based on these counts:\n    *   If `countA` is greater than `countB`, `target_color` is `Color A` and `replacement_color` is `Color B`.\n    *   If `countB` is greater than `countA`, `target_color` is `Color B` and `replacement_color` is `Color A`.\n    *   If `countA` equals `countB`, `target_color` is the numerically larger of `Color A` and `Color B`, and `replacement_color` is the numerically smaller one.\n8.  Iterate through all pixels `(r, c)` of the input grid:\n    *   If the input pixel `input[r, c]` has the `replacement_color`, change the corresponding output pixel `output[r, c]` to the background color (7).\n9.  Identify all objects composed of the `target_color` in the input grid.\n10. For each `target_color` object:\n    *   Calculate its bounding box `(min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)`.\n    *   Calculate height `h = max_row - min_row + 1` and width `w = max_col - min_col + 1`.\n    *   If `h` is odd and `w` is odd:\n        *   Calculate the center coordinates: `center_r = min_row + h // 2`, `center_c = min_col + w // 2`.\n        *   Change the color of the output pixel `output[center_r, center_c]` to the `replacement_color`.\n11.
