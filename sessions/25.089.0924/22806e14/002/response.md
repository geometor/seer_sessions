Okay, my manual counting was way off for Example 3.
*   Blue (1): Count Odd = 5
*   Green (3): Count Odd = 1
*   Rule `countA > countB`: Target is Blue (1), Replacement is Green (3).

Now let's re-evaluate the actions based on Target=Blue, Replacement=Green:
*   **Rule 1 (Code's current):** Remove all Green objects.
*   **Rule 2 (Code's current):** Change center of odd-dim Blue objects to Green.
    *   Blue Obj 1 (3x3): Center (1, 7) -> Green
    *   Blue Obj 2 (1x1): Center (3, 2) -> Green
    *   Blue Obj 3 (3x3): Center (5, 14) -> Green
    *   Blue Obj 5 (1x1): Center (10, 11) -> Green
    *   Blue Obj 6 (1x1): Center (11, 1) -> Green

Let's compare this expected action to the failed output of the code and the actual desired output for Example 3:

*   **Code's Output (Failed):**
    *   Removed Green object (Correct according to its logic).
    *   Changed centers: (1, 7) -> Green, (3, 2) -> Green, (5, 14) -> Green, (10, 11) -> Green, (11, 1) -> Green. (Correct according to its logic).
*   **Desired Output:**
    *   Green object (3x3) *persists*.
    *   Blue objects persist, *except* single-pixel ones (Obj 2, 5, 6) are removed.
    *   Centers changed: (1, 7) -> Green, (5, 14) -> Green. *Only the centers of the 3x3 Blue objects are changed.* The centers of the single-pixel Blue objects are *not* changed to Green; instead, the whole object is removed.

**New Hypotheses:**

1.  **Refined Target/Replacement Rule:** The rule for determining Target/Replacement seems correct based on re-evaluation.
2.  **Refined Rule 1 (Replacement Color):** Objects of the `replacement_color` are *not* universally removed. It seems only *single-pixel* objects of the `replacement_color` are removed. Let's check other examples:
    *   Ex 1: Replacement=Azure(8). Objects were 3x3 and 1x1. Both removed. *Contradicts.*
    *   Ex 2: Replacement=Blue(1). Object was 3x3. Removed. *Contradicts.*
    *   **Hypothesis Failed.** Let's rethink Rule 1. What if the removal depends on the *target* color?
    *   Ex 1: Target=Maroon(9), Replacement=Azure(8). Azure removed.
    *   Ex 2: Target=Azure(8), Replacement=Blue(1). Blue removed.
    *   Ex 3: Target=Blue(1), Replacement=Green(3). Green *not* fully removed.
    *   This doesn't seem right either. Back to the code's output for Ex 3 vs Desired: The code removed Green correctly according to its logic (Target=1, Replace=3), but the desired output *keeps* the Green object. This implies the code *correctly* identified Target=1, Replace=3 based on the odd-count rule, but the *actions* associated with these roles are wrong for Example 3.

3.  **Refined Rule 2 (Target Color):** Objects of the `target_color` seem to have different fates:
    *   Odd-dimension objects (h>1, w>1): Center pixel changes to `replacement_color`. (Applies to Ex 1: 3x3 Maroon; Ex 2: 5x5 Azure; Ex 3: two 3x3 Blue).
    *   Odd-dimension objects (h=1, w=1) (single pixel): The *entire object* is removed (replaced by background). (Applies to Ex 1: 1x1 Maroon center not changed, but whole object still present - *Wait*, check Ex 1 again. Target=Maroon(9), Replace=Azure(8). Odd Maroon objects: 3x3 (top right), 1x1 (bottom middle). Expected output shows center of 3x3 changed to Azure, 1x1 *unchanged*. Code changed both centers. Let me re-run Ex 1).
