There are also horizontal lines composed entirely of yellow pixels (color 4) at rows 5, 11, 17, and 23 (0-indexed). Between these yellow lines and embedded within the background pattern, there are four distinct rectangular blocks of solid color: blue (1), azure (8), white (0), and green (3). These blocks appear in a 2x2 arrangement spatially. The output is a small 2x2 grid containing the colors of these four blocks, arranged in the same relative spatial order as they appear in the input grid. The task appears to be extracting the colors of these specific embedded rectangular objects and arranging them into a smaller grid reflecting their relative positions.\n\n### Facts (YAML)\n"

In this case, there's a grid structure formed by azure (8) lines, both horizontal (rows 4, 9, 14, 19, 24) and vertical (columns 4, 9, 14, 19, 24). These lines divide the central area into a 3x3 grid of cells. Within these cells, surrounded by the azure lines and the background pattern, are nine solid-colored rectangular blocks (mostly 4x4 pixels). The colors are red (2), red (2), red (2), green (3), maroon (9), red (2), red (2), blue (1), and red (2). The output is a 3x3 grid containing these nine colors, arranged in the same relative spatial order as the blocks appear within the azure grid structure in the input. The task, again, is to extract the colors of these embedded objects and arrange them according to their relative positions.\n\n### Facts (YAML)\n"
