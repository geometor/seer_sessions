Input_Grid:
  Size: 29x29
  Contains:
    - Repeating_Background_Pattern:
        Description: Complex pattern filling most of the grid, repeats roughly every 4 rows and 10 columns.
    - Separator_Lines:
        Type: Grid (Horizontal and Vertical lines)
        Color: azure (8)
        Location_Horizontal: Rows 4, 9, 14, 19, 24 (0-indexed)
        Location_Vertical: Columns 4, 9, 14, 19, 24 (0-indexed)
        Thickness: 1 pixel
    - Embedded_Objects:
        Quantity: 9
        Shape: Rectangle (mostly 4x4 pixels)
        Arrangement: 3x3 grid layout, bounded by Separator_Lines
        Objects_List: # (Approximate centers for relative positioning)

Output_Grid:
  Size: 3x3
  Content: Colors of the Embedded_Objects from the Input_Grid.
  Arrangement: Mirrors the relative spatial arrangement of the Embedded_Objects.
Transformation:
  Action: Extraction and Arrangement
  Input_Elements: Embedded_Objects (solid color rectangles within a grid structure)
  Output_Elements: Grid containing the colors of the input objects.
  Rule: Identify solid color rectangular blocks distinct from the background and separator grid lines. Determine their relative grid layout (defined by their positions relative to each other or within the separator grid). Create an output grid of the same layout dimensions, filled with the colors of the blocks in their corresponding relative positions.
