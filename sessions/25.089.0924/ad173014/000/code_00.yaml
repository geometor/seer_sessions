Objects:
  - type: Background
    color: White (0)
    role: Static backdrop
  - type: Border
    color: Blue (1)
    shape: L-shape along left and bottom edges
    role: Static structural element, potential modifier for adjacent objects
  - type: Frame
    color: Red (2)
    shape: Rectangle (variable size, observed 5x5 and 7x7)
    role: Container defining regions for transformation
  - type: Pattern
    color: Variable (Green(3), Yellow(4), Magenta(6), Orange(7), Azure(8))
    shape: Contiguous block of single color located inside a Frame
    role: Subject of transformation

Relationships:
  - Pattern is located 'inside' Frame.
  - Frame can be 'adjacent' (including diagonally) to Border.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all Red Frames.
  - Measure: Determine the dimensions (height x width) of each Frame.
  - Identify: Find the color of the Pattern inside each Frame.
  - Check Adjacency: For 5x5 Frames containing Magenta Patterns, check if the Frame is adjacent to the Blue Border.
  - Transform Color: Change the color of the Pattern based on Frame size, original Pattern color, and (for the Magenta/5x5 case) adjacency to the Border.
  - Copy: Preserve the color and position of Background, Border, and Frame pixels.

Color Transformations:
  - Rule Set 1 (Frame size 5x5):
    - Green(3) -> Azure(8)
    - Azure(8) -> Magenta(6)
    - Orange(7) -> Green(3)
    - Magenta(6):
      - If Frame is adjacent to Blue(1) Border -> Orange(7)
      - If Frame is NOT adjacent to Blue(1) Border -> Green(3)
  - Rule Set 2 (Frame size 7x7):
    - Green(3) -> Azure(8)
    - Azure(8) -> Yellow(4)
    - Yellow(4) -> Green(3)
