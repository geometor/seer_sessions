Inside each Red frame, there is a pattern composed of a single other color (e.g., Green, Magenta, Azure, Orange, Yellow). The core task is to change the color of the pattern *inside* each Red frame based on specific rules. The background, the Blue border, and the Red frames themselves remain unchanged in the output.\n\nThe transformation rule for the color inside a Red frame depends on two factors:\n1.  The dimensions of the Red frame. Two sizes appear: 5x5 and 7x7.\n2.  The original color of the pattern inside the frame.\n3.  For one specific case (Magenta color inside a 5x5 frame), the transformation also depends on whether the frame is adjacent (including diagonals) to any part of the Blue L-shaped border.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through all pixels within the boundaries of the current Red frame in the output grid. If a pixel's color matches `C_in` in the input grid, change its color to `C_out` in the output grid.\n4.
