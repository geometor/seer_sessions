Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions (height, width)
    - pixels (color, position)
Objects:
  - Type: Boundary_Component
    Properties:
      - component_pixels: set of connected pixel coordinates {(r, c), ...}
      - color: B (where B > 0)
      - encloses: Interior_Region | None
      - status: unprocessed | processed_fill | processed_seed_removal | processed_no_seeds
  - Type: Interior_Region
    Properties:
      - region_pixels: set of pixel coordinates {(r, c), ...} inside a Boundary_Component
      - boundary_component_ref: reference to the enclosing Boundary_Component
      - seed_pixels: list of {'color': C_seed, 'pos': (r, c)} where C_seed > 0 and C_seed != Boundary_Component.color
      - seed_count: N_seeds
  - Type: Isolated_Pixel
    Properties:
      - position: (r, c)
      - initial_color: C (where C > 0)
      - status: unprocessed | removed
Relationships:
  - Connectivity: Defines Boundary_Components (pixels of same color > 0).
  - Enclosure: Boundary_Component fully surrounds Interior_Region. Determined by reachability from grid edge.
  - Adjacency: Used for connectivity and finding regions/boundaries.
  - Frequency: Used to determine fill color from seed pixel colors when N_seeds > 1.
Actions:
  - Identify_Boundary_Components: Find all connected components of non-white pixels.
  - Identify_Enclosed_Region: For each component, determine the set of pixels it fully encloses.
  - Identify_Seeds: Find non-white, non-boundary colored pixels within an enclosed region.
  - Count_Seeds: Determine N_seeds for a region.
  - Process_Region:
    - If N_seeds > 1:
        - Calculate fill color (C_fill) based on most frequent seed color (lowest index tie-breaker).
        - Mark Boundary_Component as 'processed_fill'.
        - Mark Interior_Region pixels for update to C_fill.
    - If N_seeds == 1:
        - Mark Boundary_Component as 'processed_seed_removal'.
        - Mark the single seed pixel for update to white (0).
    - If N_seeds == 0:
        - Mark Boundary_Component as 'processed_no_seeds'.
        - Mark Interior_Region pixels (if any) - no color change needed initially.
  - Cleanup_Pixels:
    - Iterate through all pixels of the initial grid.
    - If a pixel was initially non-white AND is not part of a Boundary_Component marked as 'processed_*' AND was not marked for update by Process_Region (fill or seed removal):
        - Mark this pixel for update to white (0).
  - Apply_Updates: Create the output grid by applying all marked updates.
