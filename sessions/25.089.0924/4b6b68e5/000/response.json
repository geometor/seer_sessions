            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels (integers 0-9). The grid dimensions remain the same.\n2.  **Background:** The white (0) pixels forming the main background (connected to the grid edges) remain unchanged.\n3.  **Boundaries:** Shapes or regions defined by a contiguous boundary of a single color (e.g., red=2, green=3, blue=1, yellow=4, magenta=6) seem central. These boundary pixels themselves generally remain unchanged in the output.\n4.  **Interior Regions:** The transformation happens *inside* these bounded regions. \"Inside\" refers to pixels (both white and non-white) that are enclosed by the boundary and cannot reach the outer grid edge without crossing the boundary color.\n5.  **Seed Pixels:** Within an enclosed region, non-white pixels that are *not* part of the boundary act as \"seeds\".\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** The core logic depends on the *number* and *colors* of these seed pixels within a region enclosed by a single boundary color:\n    *   **Multiple Seeds (>1):** If a region contains more than one seed pixel, the entire interior of that region (including interior white pixels and the original seed pixels) is flood-filled with a new color. This fill color is determined by finding the *most frequent* color among the original seed pixels within that region.\n    *   **Single Seed (==1):** If a region contains exactly one seed pixel, that seed pixel is removed (changed to white 0). No filling occurs.\n    *   **No Seeds (==0):** If a region contains no seed pixels (only interior white pixels), the interior remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Determine the color that appears most frequently among the seeds (let this be `C_fill`). (If there's a tie in frequency, assume a tie-breaking rule, e.g., choose the smallest color index).\n        iii. Flood fill the entire interior of the enclosed region in the output grid with `C_fill`. This changes all original interior pixels (both white and seeds) to `C_fill`. The boundary pixels `B` remain unchanged.\n    d.  **If `N_seeds` is exactly 1:**\n        i.  Locate the single seed pixel in the output grid.\n        ii.
