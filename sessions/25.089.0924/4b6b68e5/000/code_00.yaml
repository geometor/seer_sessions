Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions (height, width)
    - pixels (color, position)
Objects:
  - Type: Boundary
    Properties:
      - color (B > 0)
      - pixels (list of connected pixel positions with color B)
      - encloses: Region
  - Type: Region
    Properties:
      - interior_pixels (list of pixel positions inside a boundary)
      - boundary_color (color B of the enclosing boundary)
      - seed_pixels (list of non-white interior pixels)
        Properties:
          - color (C_seed > 0)
          - position
Relationships:
  - Enclosure: Boundary surrounds Region. A pixel is interior if all paths to the grid edge cross the Boundary color.
  - Connectivity: Pixels are connected (4-way adjacency) to form Boundaries or Regions.
  - Frequency: Used to determine the fill color from seed pixel colors.
Actions:
  - Identify_Boundaries: Find connected components of non-white colors.
  - Identify_Enclosed_Regions: For each potential boundary, find the set of interior pixels it fully encloses. Check if the boundary is formed by a single color.
  - Identify_Seeds: Find non-white pixels within an enclosed region.
  - Count_Seeds: Determine the number of seed pixels in a region.
  - Analyze_Seeds:
    - If count > 1: Calculate frequency of seed colors, find the most frequent color (C_fill).
    - If count == 1: Note the seed pixel to be removed.
    - If count == 0: No action needed for the region.
  - Transform_Region:
    - If count > 1: Flood fill the interior_pixels with C_fill.
    - If count == 1: Change the single seed pixel's color to white (0).
