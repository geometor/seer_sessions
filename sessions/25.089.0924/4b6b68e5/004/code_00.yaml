Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions (height, width)
    - pixels (color, position)
Objects:
  - Type: BoundaryComponent
    Properties:
      - color (B > 0)
      - pixels (list of connected pixel positions with color B)
      - id (unique identifier for the component)
  - Type: Region
    Properties:
      - interior_pixels (list of pixel positions fully enclosed by a BoundaryComponent)
      - enclosing_boundary_id (id of the single BoundaryComponent enclosing it)
      - seed_pixels (list of interior pixels whose color C_seed is not 0 and not the boundary color B)
        Properties:
          - color (C_seed)
          - position
Relationships:
  - Connectivity: Pixels are connected (4-way adjacency) to form BoundaryComponents.
  - Adjacency: Pixels adjacent to a BoundaryComponent.
  - Enclosure: A BoundaryComponent fully encloses a set of interior_pixels if no path exists from any interior_pixel to the grid edge without crossing a pixel belonging to that specific BoundaryComponent.
  - Frequency: Used to determine the fill color from seed pixel colors.
Actions:
  - Identify_Boundary_Components: Find all connected components of non-white pixels. Assign unique IDs and store color/pixels.
  - Identify_Enclosed_Regions:
    - For each BoundaryComponent:
      - Perform a reachability analysis (e.g., flood fill) starting from pixels adjacent to the component, restricted from crossing the component's pixels.
      - If the grid edge is NOT reachable, the filled area (excluding the component) is an enclosed Region. Record the region's interior_pixels and the enclosing_boundary_id.
  - Identify_Seeds: For each identified enclosed Region, find its seed_pixels (color != 0 and color != boundary_color).
  - Count_Seeds: Determine the number of seed pixels (N_seeds) for the region.
  - Analyze_Seeds:
    - If N_seeds > 1: Calculate frequency of seed colors, find the most frequent color (C_fill), breaking ties with the lowest color index.
    - If N_seeds == 1: Identify the single seed pixel's position (P_remove).
  - Transform_Region:
    - Apply changes to a copy of the input grid.
    - If N_seeds > 1: Change all interior_pixels of the region to C_fill.
    - If N_seeds == 1: Change the pixel at P_remove to white (0).
    - If N_seeds == 0: Make no changes to the region.
