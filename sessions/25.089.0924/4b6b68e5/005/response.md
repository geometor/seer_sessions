"""
Identifies regions fully enclosed by a single connected component of a uniform non-white color.
For each such enclosed region:
1. Finds all "seed" pixels within the region. Seeds are pixels whose color is not white (0) and not the color of the enclosing boundary component.
2. Counts the number of seed pixels (N_seeds).
3. If N_seeds > 1:
    a. Determines the most frequent color among the seeds (C_fill). Ties in frequency are broken by choosing the color with the smallest numerical index.
    b. Changes the color of all pixels within the enclosed region (both original seeds and white pixels) to C_fill in the output grid.
4. If N_seeds == 1:
    a. Changes the color of the single seed pixel to white (0) in the output grid.
5. If N_seeds == 0:
    a. Leaves the region unchanged in the output grid.
Boundary component pixels themselves remain unchanged in all cases.
Pixels not part of any identified enclosed region (e.g., exterior pixels, pixels between boundaries) also remain unchanged.
