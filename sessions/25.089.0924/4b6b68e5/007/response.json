Finds all \"seed\" pixels within the region. Seeds are pixels whose color is not white (0) and not the color of the enclosing boundary component.\n2. Counts the number of seed pixels (N_seeds).\n3. If N_seeds > 1:\n    a. Determines the most frequent color among the seeds (C_fill). Ties in frequency are broken by choosing the color with the smallest numerical index.\n    b. Changes the color of all pixels within the enclosed region (both original seeds and white pixels) to C_fill in the output grid. Marks the boundary and interior pixels as processed.\n4. If N_seeds == 1:\n    a. Changes the color of the single seed pixel to white (0) in the output grid. Marks the boundary and the seed pixel's location as processed.\n5. If N_seeds == 0:\n    a. Leaves the region unchanged in the output grid. Marks only the boundary pixels as processed.\nBoundary component pixels themselves remain unchanged unless overwritten by a fill in a *different* region's processing step (unlikely but possible in complex overlaps).\nAfter processing all components, any pixel that was initially non-white and has not been marked as processed (either as part of a boundary or a transformed region) is changed to white (0).\n\"\"\"\n\n# Imports are implicitly handled by the environment\n\ndef get_neighbors(r, c, height, width):\n    \"\"\"Gets 4-directionally adjacent valid neighbor coordinates.\"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    if r > 0: neighbors.append((r - 1, c))\n    if r < height - 1: neighbors.append((r + 1, c))\n    if c > 0: neighbors.append((r, c - 1))\n    if c < width - 1: neighbors.append((r, c + 1))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef find_connected_components(grid_np):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all connected components of non-white pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_np: Numpy array representing the grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of tuples, where each tuple is (component_pixels_set, component_color).\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid_np.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid_np, dtype=bool)\n    components = []\n    \n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            color = grid_np[r, c]\n            # Start BFS if non-white and not visited\n            if color != 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                component_pixels = set()\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                component_pixels.add((r, c))\n                \n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors(row, col, height, width):\n                        # Check if neighbor has same color and not visited\n                        if grid_np[nr, nc] == color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            component_pixels.add((nr, nc))\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                            \n                if component_pixels:\n                    components.append((component_pixels, color))\n                    \n    return components\n\ndef find_interior_region(grid_np, component_pixels):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the interior region enclosed by a given component.\n    Uses flood fill from edges, treating the component pixels as walls.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_np: Numpy array representing the grid.\n        component_pixels: A set of (r, c) tuples for the boundary component.\n\n    Returns:\n        A set of (r, c) tuples representing the interior pixels, \n        or an empty set if no fully enclosed interior exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid_np.shape\n    \n    # Mark component pixels as walls (visited)\n    exterior_visited = np.zeros_like(grid_np, dtype=bool)\n    for r, c in component_pixels:\n        exterior_visited[r, c] = True\n        \n    q = deque()\n    \n    # Add edge pixels to queue if they are not walls (part of the component)\n    # Crucially, only add if the pixel is actually within grid bounds\n    for r in range(height):\n        if 0 <= r < height and 0 <= 0 < width and not exterior_visited[r, 0]: \n            q.append((r, 0));
