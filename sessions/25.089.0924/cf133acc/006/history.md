**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain a white background (0) and various colored horizontal and vertical line segments.
2.  **Horizontal Lines:** Some horizontal lines have a single white pixel gap within them. These lines are typically 3 or more pixels long (including the gap).
3.  **Vertical Lines:** Some input grids also contain distinct vertical line segments, often located below the horizontal lines.
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The primary transformation involves modifying the grid based on the properties of the horizontal lines with gaps.
5.  **Gap Filling:** The single white pixel gap within identified horizontal lines is filled with the color of that line.
6.  **Vertical Ray Emission:** From the position where a gap was filled, a vertical "ray" or line is projected upwards.
7.  **Ray Color:** The color of the upward ray matches the color of the horizontal line from which it originates (the color used to fill the gap).
8.  **Ray Termination:** The upward ray stops extending when it hits the top boundary of the grid or another non-white pixel in its path.
9.  **Overwriting:** The pixels filled by the upward rays overwrite any existing pixels (white or colored) in those locations.
10. **Unmodified Elements:** Pixels not part of a horizontal line gap or the path of an upward ray remain unchanged from the input. This includes the original vertical line segments present in the input that are not overwritten.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
      contains:
        - colored_pixels
        - objects

  - type: object
    subtype: horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: C (any color 1-9)
      orientation: horizontal
      structure: contiguous segment of color C, possibly interrupted by a single white pixel
      minimum_length_for_action: 3 (including potential gap)

  - type: object
    subtype: vertical_line
    properties:
      color: V (any color 1-9)
      orientation: vertical
      structure: contiguous segment of color V

  - type: location
    subtype: gap
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      position: (R, C) within a horizontal_line object
      condition: must be the *only* white pixel interrupting the horizontal_line

actions:
  - name: find_gapped_horizontal_lines
    input: grid
    output: list of tuples (line_color C, gap_row R, gap_col C_gap)
    condition: horizontal line of color C at row R contains exactly one white pixel gap at C_gap, and total span (line + gap) is >= 3.

  - name: fill_gap
    input: grid, gap_location (R, C_gap), fill_color C
    output: modified grid
    effect: Sets the pixel value at (R, C_gap) to C.

  - name: draw_vertical_ray_upwards
    input: grid, start_location (R_start, C), color C_ray
    output: modified grid
    effect:
      - Start at row r = R_start - 1.
      - While r >= 0 AND grid[r, C] is white (0):
        - Set grid[r, C] = C_ray
        - Decrement r
    constraints: This action overwrites existing pixels in the ray's path.

relationships:
  - The color of the vertical ray drawn upwards matches the color of the horizontal line whose gap initiated the ray.
  - The vertical ray originates from the column of the filled gap and extends upwards from the row directly above the horizontal line.
  - The vertical ray stops extending if it encounters any non-white pixel or the grid boundary.
  - Original vertical lines in the input persist in the output unless overwritten by a new vertical ray.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all horizontal line segments that meet the following criteria:
    *   Composed of a single color (let's call it `line_color`).
    *   Interrupted by exactly one white (0) pixel (let's call its location `(gap_row, gap_col)`).
    *   The total horizontal span covered by the colored pixels and the single gap is at least 3 pixels.
3.  For each identified horizontal line segment and its gap:
    a.  In the output grid, change the color of the pixel at `(gap_row, gap_col)` to `line_color`.
    b.  Starting from the row directly above the gap (`ray_row = gap_row - 1`) and in the same column (`ray_col = gap_col`):
        i.  Check the color of the pixel at `(ray_row, ray_col)` in the output grid.
        ii. While the `ray_row` is within the grid boundaries (>= 0) AND the pixel at `(ray_row, ray_col)` is white (0):
            1.  Change the color of the pixel at `(ray_row, ray_col)` to `line_color`.
            2.  Decrement `ray_row` by 1 (move one row up).
4.  Return the final state of the output grid.

2. Draws a vertical ray upwards from the position of the filled gap, using the same line color.

"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identify horizontal line segments composed of a single non-white color 'C' that are interrupted by exactly one white (0) pixel gap.
2. The total horizontal span covered by the colored pixels of the segment plus the single gap must be 3 pixels or more.
3. For each such identified segment and its gap:
    a. Fill the white gap pixel in the output grid with the line color 'C'.
    b. Starting from the row directly above the filled gap, draw a vertical ray upwards in the same column.
    c. This upward ray uses the same color 'C'.
    d. The ray continues upwards, coloring white (0) pixels it encounters.
    e. The ray stops extending upwards immediately if it encounters a non-white (non-zero) pixel in the output grid or reaches the top edge (row 0).
    f. The pixels colored by the ray overwrite the original white pixels.
4. Pixels in the grid that are not part of a filled gap or overwritten by an upward ray retain their original color from the input grid.
