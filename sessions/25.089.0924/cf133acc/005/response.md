"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identify horizontal line segments composed of a single non-white color 'C' that are interrupted by exactly one white (0) pixel gap.
2. The total horizontal span covered by the colored pixels of the segment plus the single gap must be 3 pixels or more.
3. For each such identified segment and its gap:
    a. Fill the white gap pixel in the output grid with the line color 'C'.
    b. Starting from the row directly above the filled gap, draw a vertical ray upwards in the same column.
    c. This upward ray uses the same color 'C'.
    d. The ray continues upwards, coloring white (0) pixels it encounters.
    e. The ray stops extending upwards immediately if it encounters a non-white (non-zero) pixel in the output grid or reaches the top edge (row 0).
    f. The pixels colored by the ray overwrite the original white pixels.
4. Pixels in the grid that are not part of a filled gap or overwritten by an upward ray retain their original color from the input grid.
