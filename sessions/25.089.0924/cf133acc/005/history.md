**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain a white background (0) and various colored horizontal and vertical line segments.
2.  **Horizontal Lines:** Some horizontal lines have a single white pixel gap within them. These lines are typically 3 or more pixels long (including the gap).
3.  **Vertical Lines:** Some input grids also contain distinct vertical line segments, often located below the horizontal lines.
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The primary transformation involves modifying the grid based on the properties of the horizontal lines with gaps.
5.  **Gap Filling:** The single white pixel gap within identified horizontal lines is filled with the color of that line.
6.  **Vertical Ray Emission:** From the position where a gap was filled, a vertical "ray" or line is projected upwards.
7.  **Ray Color:** The color of the upward ray matches the color of the horizontal line from which it originates (the color used to fill the gap).
8.  **Ray Termination:** The upward ray stops extending when it hits the top boundary of the grid or another non-white pixel in its path.
9.  **Overwriting:** The pixels filled by the upward rays overwrite any existing pixels (white or colored) in those locations.
10. **Unmodified Elements:** Pixels not part of a horizontal line gap or the path of an upward ray remain unchanged from the input. This includes the original vertical line segments present in the input that are not overwritten.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
      contains:
        - colored_pixels
        - objects

  - type: object
    subtype: horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: C (any color 1-9)
      orientation: horizontal
      structure: contiguous segment of color C, possibly interrupted by a single white pixel
      minimum_length_for_action: 3 (including potential gap)

  - type: object
    subtype: vertical_line
    properties:
      color: V (any color 1-9)
      orientation: vertical
      structure: contiguous segment of color V

  - type: location
    subtype: gap
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      position: (R, C) within a horizontal_line object
      condition: must be the *only* white pixel interrupting the horizontal_line

actions:
  - name: find_gapped_horizontal_lines
    input: grid
    output: list of tuples (line_color C, gap_row R, gap_col C_gap)
    condition: horizontal line of color C at row R contains exactly one white pixel gap at C_gap, and total span (line + gap) is >= 3.

  - name: fill_gap
    input: grid, gap_location (R, C_gap), fill_color C
    output: modified grid
    effect: Sets the pixel value at (R, C_gap) to C.

  - name: draw_vertical_ray_upwards
    input: grid, start_location (R_start, C), color C_ray
    output: modified grid
    effect:
      - Start at row r = R_start - 1.
      - While r >= 0 AND grid[r, C] is white (0):
        - Set grid[r, C] = C_ray
        - Decrement r
    constraints: This action overwrites existing pixels in the ray's path.

relationships:
  - The color of the vertical ray drawn upwards matches the color of the horizontal line whose gap initiated the ray.
  - The vertical ray originates from the column of the filled gap and extends upwards from the row directly above the horizontal line.
  - The vertical ray stops extending if it encounters any non-white pixel or the grid boundary.
  - Original vertical lines in the input persist in the output unless overwritten by a new vertical ray.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all horizontal line segments that meet the following criteria:
    *   Composed of a single color (let's call it `line_color`).
    *   Interrupted by exactly one white (0) pixel (let's call its location `(gap_row, gap_col)`).
    *   The total horizontal span covered by the colored pixels and the single gap is at least 3 pixels.
3.  For each identified horizontal line segment and its gap:
    a.  In the output grid, change the color of the pixel at `(gap_row, gap_col)` to `line_color`.
    b.  Starting from the row directly above the gap (`ray_row = gap_row - 1`) and in the same column (`ray_col = gap_col`):
        i.  Check the color of the pixel at `(ray_row, ray_col)` in the output grid.
        ii. While the `ray_row` is within the grid boundaries (>= 0) AND the pixel at `(ray_row, ray_col)` is white (0):
            1.  Change the color of the pixel at `(ray_row, ray_col)` to `line_color`.
            2.  Decrement `ray_row` by 1 (move one row up).
4.  Return the final state of the output grid.

"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rule:
1. Identify horizontal line segments of a single color 'C' that are interrupted by exactly one white (0) pixel gap.
2. The total horizontal span of the colored segments plus the single gap must be at least 3 pixels.
3. For each identified segment and gap:
    a. Fill the single white gap pixel with the line color 'C'.
    b. Draw a vertical ray upwards from the position directly above the filled gap, using the same color 'C'.
    c. This upward ray continues until it reaches the top edge (row 0) of the grid.
    d. The ray overwrites any existing pixel values (white or colored) in its path.
4. Pixels not part of a filled gap or an upward ray path remain unchanged from the input grid.

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: finding horizontal lines with a single white gap, filling the gap, and projecting a ray upwards. However, the implementation of the upward ray projection was flawed. The initial code caused the ray to overwrite all pixels up to the top boundary, regardless of their original color or colors modified by other rays during the transformation.

The analysis of the failed examples reveals that the upward ray must stop its propagation as soon as it encounters *any* non-white (non-zero) pixel. This check needs to be performed against the *current state* of the output grid as it's being built, meaning rays can be blocked by pixels filled in by previously processed gaps in the same transformation step.

The strategy for resolution is to modify the ray-drawing logic to include this stopping condition.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

Let's analyze each example to confirm the refined understanding.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
      contains:
        - colored_pixels
        - objects

  - type: object
    subtype: horizontal_line_segment
    properties:
      color: C (any color 1-9)
      orientation: horizontal
      structure: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of color C.

  - type: location
    subtype: potential_gap
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      position: (R, C_gap)
      context: Must be located within a row R, at column C_gap, such that the pixels at (R, C_gap-1) and (R, C_gap+1) exist and are the same non-white color (let's call it `line_color`).

  - type: object
    subtype: gapped_horizontal_line
    criteria:
      - Identify a `potential_gap` at (R, C_gap) with `line_color`.
      - Trace left from (R, C_gap-1) as long as pixels have `line_color`. Let the leftmost column be `start_c`.
      - Trace right from (R, C_gap+1) as long as pixels have `line_color`. Let the rightmost column be `end_c`.
      - The segment span is `end_c - start_c + 1`. This span must be >= 3.
      - Within the columns `start_c` to `end_c` in row R, there must be exactly one white pixel (the `potential_gap` at `C_gap`), and all other pixels must have `line_color`.
    properties:
        color: `line_color`
        gap_location: (R, `C_gap`)
        row: R

actions:
  - name: find_gapped_horizontal_lines
    input: grid
    output: list of `gapped_horizontal_line` objects (containing color C, gap_row R, gap_col C_gap)

  - name: fill_gap
    input: grid_state, gap_location (R, C_gap), fill_color C
    output: modified grid_state
    effect: Sets the pixel value at (R, C_gap) in the grid_state to C.

  - name: draw_vertical_ray_upwards
    input: grid_state, start_location (R_start, C), color C_ray
    output: modified grid_state
    effect:
      - Initialize current row `r = R_start - 1`.
      - While `r >= 0`:
        - Check the pixel value in the `grid_state` at (`r`, `C`).
        - If the pixel value is NOT white (0), STOP the ray.
        - If the pixel value IS white (0), set `grid_state[r, C] = C_ray`.
        - Decrement `r` by 1.
    constraints:
      - The ray starts one row above the original gap row (`R_start`).
      - The check for stopping condition (non-white pixel) is performed on the `grid_state` which might have been modified by previous `fill_gap` or `draw_vertical_ray_upwards` actions within the same overall transformation process.

relationships:
  - The color of the vertical ray (`C_ray`) matches the color of the horizontal line (`line_color`) whose gap initiated the ray.
  - The vertical ray originates from the column of the filled gap (`C_gap`) and extends upwards from the row directly above the horizontal line (`R_start - 1`).
  - Original pixels in the input grid persist in the output unless they are part of a filled gap or overwritten by an upward ray according to the rules.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Create a list to store the details of identified valid gaps (row, column, color).
3.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the `input_grid` to check if it's a potential gap:
    *   A potential gap must be white (0).
    *   It must have neighboring pixels within the grid bounds to its left `(r, c-1)` and right `(r, c+1)`.
    *   The left and right neighbors must be the same non-white color (`line_color`).
4.  If a potential gap at `(r, c)` with `line_color` is found:
    *   Determine the full horizontal extent (`start_c` to `end_c`) of the segment formed by `line_color` pixels surrounding this gap in row `r`.
    *   Verify that the total span (`end_c - start_c + 1`) is at least 3 pixels.
    *   Verify that within this span in row `r`, the pixel at `(r, c)` is the *only* white pixel, and all other pixels have `line_color`.
    *   If all these conditions are met, record this as a valid gap: store its row `r`, column `c`, and color `line_color`. Use a mechanism (like a set of processed gap coordinates) to avoid identifying the same line segment multiple times if the initial scan hits different parts of it.
5.  After identifying all valid gaps in the `input_grid`:
    *   For each identified valid gap (row `r`, column `c`, color `line_color`):
        a.  Fill the gap in the `output_grid`: Set `output_grid[r, c] = line_color`.
        b.  Draw the upward ray:
            i.  Start at `ray_r = r - 1`.
            ii. While `ray_r` is within the grid boundaries (`>= 0`):
                1.  Check the pixel color in the `output_grid` at `(ray_r, c)`.
                2.  If `output_grid[ray_r, c]` is NOT white (0), stop drawing this ray.
                3.  If `output_grid[ray_r, c]` IS white (0), set `output_grid[ray_r, c] = line_color`.
                4.  Decrement `ray_r` by 1 (move up).
6.  Return the final `output_grid`.
