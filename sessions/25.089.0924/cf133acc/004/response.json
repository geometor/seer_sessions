            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: finding horizontal lines with a single white gap, filling the gap, and projecting a ray upwards. However, the implementation of the upward ray projection was flawed. The initial code caused the ray to overwrite all pixels up to the top boundary, regardless of their original color or colors modified by other rays during the transformation.\n\nThe analysis of the failed examples reveals that the upward ray must stop its propagation as soon as it encounters *any* non-white (non-zero) pixel. This check needs to be performed against the *current state* of the output grid as it's being built, meaning rays can be blocked by pixels filled in by previously processed gaps in the same transformation step.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is to modify the ray-drawing logic to include this stopping condition.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nLet's analyze each example to confirm the refined understanding.\n\n"

Create a list to store the details of identified valid gaps (row, column, color).\n3.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the `input_grid` to check if it's a potential gap:\n    *   A potential gap must be white (0).\n    *   It must have neighboring pixels within the grid bounds to its left `(r, c-1)` and right `(r, c+1)`.\n    *   The left and right neighbors must be the same non-white color (`line_color`).\n4.  If a potential gap at `(r, c)` with `line_color` is found:\n    *   Determine the full horizontal extent (`start_c` to `end_c`) of the segment formed by `line_color` pixels surrounding this gap in row `r`.\n    *   Verify that the total span (`end_c - start_c + 1`) is at least 3 pixels.\n    *   Verify that within this span in row `r`, the pixel at `(r, c)` is the *only* white pixel, and all other pixels have `line_color`.\n    *   If all these conditions are met, record this as a valid gap: store its row `r`, column `c`, and color `line_color`. Use a mechanism (like a set of processed gap coordinates) to avoid identifying the same line segment multiple times if the initial scan hits different parts of it.\n5.  After identifying all valid gaps in the `input_grid`:\n    *   For each identified valid gap (row `r`, column `c`, color `line_color`):\n        a.  Fill the gap in the `output_grid`: Set `output_grid[r, c] = line_color`.\n        b.  Draw the upward ray:\n            i.  Start at `ray_r = r - 1`.\n            ii. While `ray_r` is within the grid boundaries (`>= 0`):\n                1.  Check the pixel color in the `output_grid` at `(ray_r, c)`.\n                2.  If `output_grid[ray_r, c]` is NOT white (0), stop drawing this ray.\n                3.  If `output_grid[ray_r, c]` IS white (0), set `output_grid[ray_r, c] = line_color`.\n                4.  Decrement `ray_r` by 1 (move up).\n6.  Return the final `output_grid`."
