**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain a white background (0) and various colored horizontal and vertical line segments.
2.  **Horizontal Lines:** Some horizontal lines have a single white pixel gap within them. These lines are typically 3 or more pixels long (including the gap).
3.  **Vertical Lines:** Some input grids also contain distinct vertical line segments, often located below the horizontal lines.
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The primary transformation involves modifying the grid based on the properties of the horizontal lines with gaps.
5.  **Gap Filling:** The single white pixel gap within identified horizontal lines is filled with the color of that line.
6.  **Vertical Ray Emission:** From the position where a gap was filled, a vertical "ray" or line is projected upwards.
7.  **Ray Color:** The color of the upward ray matches the color of the horizontal line from which it originates (the color used to fill the gap).
8.  **Ray Termination:** The upward ray stops extending when it hits the top boundary of the grid or another non-white pixel in its path.
9.  **Overwriting:** The pixels filled by the upward rays overwrite any existing pixels (white or colored) in those locations.
10. **Unmodified Elements:** Pixels not part of a horizontal line gap or the path of an upward ray remain unchanged from the input. This includes the original vertical line segments present in the input that are not overwritten.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
      contains:
        - colored_pixels
        - objects

  - type: object
    subtype: horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: C (any color 1-9)
      orientation: horizontal
      structure: contiguous segment of color C, possibly interrupted by a single white pixel
      minimum_length_for_action: 3 (including potential gap)

  - type: object
    subtype: vertical_line
    properties:
      color: V (any color 1-9)
      orientation: vertical
      structure: contiguous segment of color V

  - type: location
    subtype: gap
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      position: (R, C) within a horizontal_line object
      condition: must be the *only* white pixel interrupting the horizontal_line

actions:
  - name: find_gapped_horizontal_lines
    input: grid
    output: list of tuples (line_color C, gap_row R, gap_col C_gap)
    condition: horizontal line of color C at row R contains exactly one white pixel gap at C_gap, and total span (line + gap) is >= 3.

  - name: fill_gap
    input: grid, gap_location (R, C_gap), fill_color C
    output: modified grid
    effect: Sets the pixel value at (R, C_gap) to C.

  - name: draw_vertical_ray_upwards
    input: grid, start_location (R_start, C), color C_ray
    output: modified grid
    effect:
      - Start at row r = R_start - 1.
      - While r >= 0 AND grid[r, C] is white (0):
        - Set grid[r, C] = C_ray
        - Decrement r
    constraints: This action overwrites existing pixels in the ray's path.

relationships:
  - The color of the vertical ray drawn upwards matches the color of the horizontal line whose gap initiated the ray.
  - The vertical ray originates from the column of the filled gap and extends upwards from the row directly above the horizontal line.
  - The vertical ray stops extending if it encounters any non-white pixel or the grid boundary.
  - Original vertical lines in the input persist in the output unless overwritten by a new vertical ray.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all horizontal line segments that meet the following criteria:
    *   Composed of a single color (let's call it `line_color`).
    *   Interrupted by exactly one white (0) pixel (let's call its location `(gap_row, gap_col)`).
    *   The total horizontal span covered by the colored pixels and the single gap is at least 3 pixels.
3.  For each identified horizontal line segment and its gap:
    a.  In the output grid, change the color of the pixel at `(gap_row, gap_col)` to `line_color`.
    b.  Starting from the row directly above the gap (`ray_row = gap_row - 1`) and in the same column (`ray_col = gap_col`):
        i.  Check the color of the pixel at `(ray_row, ray_col)` in the output grid.
        ii. While the `ray_row` is within the grid boundaries (>= 0) AND the pixel at `(ray_row, ray_col)` is white (0):
            1.  Change the color of the pixel at `(ray_row, ray_col)` to `line_color`.
            2.  Decrement `ray_row` by 1 (move one row up).
4.  Return the final state of the output grid.
