            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain a white background (0) and various colored horizontal and vertical line segments.\n2.  **Horizontal Lines:** Some horizontal lines have a single white pixel gap within them. These lines are typically 3 or more pixels long (including the gap).\n3.  **Vertical Lines:** Some input grids also contain distinct vertical line segments, often located below the horizontal lines.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The primary transformation involves modifying the grid based on the properties of the horizontal lines with gaps.\n5.  **Gap Filling:** The single white pixel gap within identified horizontal lines is filled with the color of that line.\n6.  **Vertical Ray Emission:** From the position where a gap was filled, a vertical \"ray\" or line is projected upwards.\n7.  **Ray Color:** The color of the upward ray matches the color of the horizontal line from which it originates (the color used to fill the gap).\n8.  **Ray Termination:** The upward ray stops extending when it hits the top boundary of the grid or another non-white pixel in its path.\n9.  **Overwriting:** The pixels filled by the upward rays overwrite any existing pixels (white or colored) in those locations.\n10. **Unmodified Elements:** Pixels not part of a horizontal line gap or the path of an upward ray remain unchanged from the input. This includes the original vertical line segments present in the input that are not overwritten.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
