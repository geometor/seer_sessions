elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
      contains:
        - colored_pixels
        - objects

  - type: object
    subtype: horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: C (any color 1-9)
      orientation: horizontal
      structure: contiguous segment of color C, possibly interrupted by a single white pixel
      minimum_length_for_action: 3 (including potential gap)

  - type: object
    subtype: vertical_line
    properties:
      color: V (any color 1-9)
      orientation: vertical
      structure: contiguous segment of color V

  - type: location
    subtype: gap
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      position: (R, C) within a horizontal_line object
      condition: must be the *only* white pixel interrupting the horizontal_line

actions:
  - name: find_gapped_horizontal_lines
    input: grid
    output: list of tuples (line_color C, gap_row R, gap_col C_gap)
    condition: horizontal line of color C at row R contains exactly one white pixel gap at C_gap, and total span (line + gap) is >= 3.

  - name: fill_gap
    input: grid, gap_location (R, C_gap), fill_color C
    output: modified grid
    effect: Sets the pixel value at (R, C_gap) to C.

  - name: draw_vertical_ray_upwards
    input: grid, start_location (R_start, C), color C_ray
    output: modified grid
    effect:
      - Start at row r = R_start - 1.
      - While r >= 0 AND grid[r, C] is white (0):
        - Set grid[r, C] = C_ray
        - Decrement r
    constraints: This action overwrites existing pixels in the ray's path.

relationships:
  - The color of the vertical ray drawn upwards matches the color of the horizontal line whose gap initiated the ray.
  - The vertical ray originates from the column of the filled gap and extends upwards from the row directly above the horizontal line.
  - The vertical ray stops extending if it encounters any non-white pixel or the grid boundary.
  - Original vertical lines in the input persist in the output unless overwritten by a new vertical ray.
