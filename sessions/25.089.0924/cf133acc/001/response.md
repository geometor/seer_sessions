"""
Identifies horizontal lines of a single color that are interrupted by exactly one white (0) pixel gap, provided the total span (line + gap) is at least 3 pixels.
For each such identified line:
1. Fills the single white gap with the color of the line.
2. Draws a vertical ray upwards from the position of the filled gap, using the same line color.
3. The upward ray stops if it hits the top boundary of the grid or any non-white pixel.
4. The ray overwrites any pixels (white or colored) in its path.
5. Pixels not part of a filled gap or an upward ray remain unchanged.
