**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain a white background (0) and various colored horizontal and vertical line segments.
2.  **Horizontal Lines:** Some horizontal lines have a single white pixel gap within them. These lines are typically 3 or more pixels long (including the gap).
3.  **Vertical Lines:** Some input grids also contain distinct vertical line segments, often located below the horizontal lines.
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The primary transformation involves modifying the grid based on the properties of the horizontal lines with gaps.
5.  **Gap Filling:** The single white pixel gap within identified horizontal lines is filled with the color of that line.
6.  **Vertical Ray Emission:** From the position where a gap was filled, a vertical "ray" or line is projected upwards.
7.  **Ray Color:** The color of the upward ray matches the color of the horizontal line from which it originates (the color used to fill the gap).
8.  **Ray Termination:** The upward ray stops extending when it hits the top boundary of the grid or another non-white pixel in its path.
9.  **Overwriting:** The pixels filled by the upward rays overwrite any existing pixels (white or colored) in those locations.
10. **Unmodified Elements:** Pixels not part of a horizontal line gap or the path of an upward ray remain unchanged from the input. This includes the original vertical line segments present in the input that are not overwritten.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
      contains:
        - colored_pixels
        - objects

  - type: object
    subtype: horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: C (any color 1-9)
      orientation: horizontal
      structure: contiguous segment of color C, possibly interrupted by a single white pixel
      minimum_length_for_action: 3 (including potential gap)

  - type: object
    subtype: vertical_line
    properties:
      color: V (any color 1-9)
      orientation: vertical
      structure: contiguous segment of color V

  - type: location
    subtype: gap
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      position: (R, C) within a horizontal_line object
      condition: must be the *only* white pixel interrupting the horizontal_line

actions:
  - name: find_gapped_horizontal_lines
    input: grid
    output: list of tuples (line_color C, gap_row R, gap_col C_gap)
    condition: horizontal line of color C at row R contains exactly one white pixel gap at C_gap, and total span (line + gap) is >= 3.

  - name: fill_gap
    input: grid, gap_location (R, C_gap), fill_color C
    output: modified grid
    effect: Sets the pixel value at (R, C_gap) to C.

  - name: draw_vertical_ray_upwards
    input: grid, start_location (R_start, C), color C_ray
    output: modified grid
    effect:
      - Start at row r = R_start - 1.
      - While r >= 0 AND grid[r, C] is white (0):
        - Set grid[r, C] = C_ray
        - Decrement r
    constraints: This action overwrites existing pixels in the ray's path.

relationships:
  - The color of the vertical ray drawn upwards matches the color of the horizontal line whose gap initiated the ray.
  - The vertical ray originates from the column of the filled gap and extends upwards from the row directly above the horizontal line.
  - The vertical ray stops extending if it encounters any non-white pixel or the grid boundary.
  - Original vertical lines in the input persist in the output unless overwritten by a new vertical ray.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all horizontal line segments that meet the following criteria:
    *   Composed of a single color (let's call it `line_color`).
    *   Interrupted by exactly one white (0) pixel (let's call its location `(gap_row, gap_col)`).
    *   The total horizontal span covered by the colored pixels and the single gap is at least 3 pixels.
3.  For each identified horizontal line segment and its gap:
    a.  In the output grid, change the color of the pixel at `(gap_row, gap_col)` to `line_color`.
    b.  Starting from the row directly above the gap (`ray_row = gap_row - 1`) and in the same column (`ray_col = gap_col`):
        i.  Check the color of the pixel at `(ray_row, ray_col)` in the output grid.
        ii. While the `ray_row` is within the grid boundaries (>= 0) AND the pixel at `(ray_row, ray_col)` is white (0):
            1.  Change the color of the pixel at `(ray_row, ray_col)` to `line_color`.
            2.  Decrement `ray_row` by 1 (move one row up).
4.  Return the final state of the output grid.

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: finding horizontal lines with single-pixel gaps, filling the gaps, and projecting a ray upwards. The provided code attempted to implement this. However, the comparison between the `Transformed Output` (generated by the code) and the `Expected Output` revealed discrepancies in all examples.

The discrepancies consistently showed that the `Transformed Output` was missing vertical line segments that were present below the horizontal gapped line in the `Input` and `Expected Output`. This suggests the error wasn't in the *upward* ray logic itself, but potentially in how the initial state was handled or how the comparison was performed.

However, a closer look at the Input -> Expected Output pairs, ignoring the potentially incorrect `Transformed Output` provided in the results, reveals a consistent pattern:
1.  The single white gap in qualifying horizontal lines is filled with the line's color.
2.  A vertical ray of the *same color* extends *upwards* from the row directly above the filled gap, in the same column.
3.  This ray continues to the top edge of the grid, overwriting *any* pixel (white or colored) in its path.
4.  All pixels *not* part of the filled gap or the upward ray path remain exactly as they were in the input grid.

The original code had a condition `if output_grid[ray_r, gap_col] != 0: break` in the ray-drawing loop. This would incorrectly stop the ray if it encountered *any* non-white pixel, whereas the rule derived from the examples suggests the ray should overwrite everything in its path upwards.

**Strategy:**

1.  Trust the Input -> Expected Output pairs as the ground truth for the transformation rule.
2.  Refine the natural language program and YAML facts to precisely describe the observed rule, specifically the unconditional upward overwriting behavior of the ray.
3.  Correct the code implementation to remove the condition that prematurely stops the ray.

**Metrics (Based on Input -> Expected Output):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Size: 15x15
    *   Gaps Found:
        *   (Row 9, Col 3), Color 2, Span 8 (>=3) -> Fill (9,3) with 2, Ray up from (8,3) with 2.
        *   (Row 9, Col 9), Color 3, Span 7 (>=3) -> Fill (9,9) with 3, Ray up from (8,9) with 3.
    *   Pixels Changed: 1 (gap fill) + 9 (ray) + 1 (gap fill) + 9 (ray) = 20 pixels.
    *   Preserved Pixels: Original vertical lines (Green at col 3, Yellow at col 9, below row 9) are preserved.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Size: 15x15
    *   Gaps Found:
        *   (Row 3, Col 3), Color 3, Span 7 (>=3) -> Fill (3,3) with 3, Ray up from (2,3) with 3.
        *   (Row 6, Col 9), Color 6, Span 9 (>=3) -> Fill (6,9) with 6, Ray up from (5,9) with 6.
        *   (Row 8, Col 3), Color 4, Span 7 (>=3) -> Fill (8,3) with 4, Ray up from (7,3) with 4.
        *   (Row 8, Col 9), Color 7, Span 7 (>=3) -> Fill (8,9) with 7, Ray up from (7,9) with 7.
    *   Pixels Changed: (1+3) + (1+6) + (1+8) + (1+8) = 29 pixels.
    *   Preserved Pixels: Original vertical lines (Blue at col 3, Gray at col 9, below row 8) are preserved.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Size: 15x15
    *   Gaps Found:
        *   (Row 3, Col 1), Color 8, Span 6 (>=3) -> Fill (3,1) with 8, Ray up from (2,1) with 8.
        *   (Row 2, Col 9), Color 7, Span 9 (>=3) -> Fill (2,9) with 7, Ray up from (1,9) with 7.
        *   (Row 5, Col 9), Color 6, Span 9 (>=3) -> Fill (5,9) with 6, Ray up from (4,9) with 6.
        *   (Row 8, Col 1), Color 3, Span 6 (>=3) -> Fill (8,1) with 3, Ray up from (7,1) with 3.
        *   (Row 11, Col 1), Color 9, Span 6 (>=3) -> Fill (11,1) with 9, Ray up from (10,1) with 9.
        *   (Row 11, Col 9), Color 5, Span 9 (>=3) -> Fill (11,9) with 5, Ray up from (10,9) with 5.
        *   (Row 14, Col 1), Color 1, Span 3 (>=3) -> Fill (14,1) with 1, Ray up from (13,1) with 1.
        *   (Row 14, Col 9), Color 1, Span 3 (>=3) -> Fill (14,9) with 1, Ray up from (13,9) with 1.
    *   Pixels Changed: (1+3) + (1+2) + (1+5) + (1+8) + (1+11) + (1+11) + (1+14) + (1+14) = 74 pixels.
    *   Preserved Pixels: All other original pixels are preserved.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
      contains:
        - colored_pixels
        - objects

  - type: object
    subtype: horizontal_line_segment
    properties:
      color: C (any color 1-9)
      orientation: horizontal
      structure: contiguous segment of color C

  - type: object
    subtype: gapped_horizontal_line
    description: A potential target for transformation.
    properties:
      color: C (any color 1-9)
      orientation: horizontal
      location: row R
      structure: Consists of one or more horizontal_line_segments of color C, separated by exactly one white (0) pixel (the gap) at column C_gap.
      condition: The total horizontal span (sum of segment lengths + 1 for the gap) must be >= 3.

  - type: location
    subtype: gap
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      position: (R, C_gap) within a gapped_horizontal_line

actions:
  - name: find_qualifying_gaps
    input: grid
    output: list of tuples (line_color C, gap_row R, gap_col C_gap)
    description: Identifies all single-pixel white gaps within horizontal lines of a single color where the total span (line parts + gap) is 3 or more pixels.

  - name: fill_gap
    input: grid, gap_location (R, C_gap), fill_color C
    output: modified grid
    effect: Sets the pixel value at (R, C_gap) to C.

  - name: draw_overwriting_vertical_ray_upwards
    input: grid, start_row R_start (row above the gap), column C_ray, color C_ray
    output: modified grid
    effect:
      - Iterate row `r` from `R_start` down to 0.
      - For each `r`, set grid[r, C_ray] = C_ray.
    constraints: This action unconditionally overwrites any existing pixel values in its path from R_start up to row 0.

relationships:
  - The `fill_gap` action uses the `line_color` of the `gapped_horizontal_line`.
  - The `draw_overwriting_vertical_ray_upwards` action is triggered for each filled gap.
  - The ray starts at `R - 1` (where R is the row of the filled gap) and `C_gap`.
  - The ray uses the same `line_color` (C) as the filled gap.
  - Pixels in the grid not explicitly modified by `fill_gap` or `draw_overwriting_vertical_ray_upwards` retain their original values from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all locations `(R, C_gap)` in the input grid that represent a single white (0) pixel gap within a horizontal line of a consistent color `C`. To qualify:
    *   The pixels immediately to the left (`C_gap - 1`) and right (`C_gap + 1`) must exist and have the same color `C`.
    *   Scanning left and right from the gap, the sequence must consist only of color `C` pixels until the line ends or another color/gap is encountered.
    *   There must be exactly one white (0) pixel (the gap at `C_gap`) within this identified horizontal extent.
    *   The total horizontal span (number of `C` pixels + 1 for the gap) must be 3 or greater.
3.  For each qualifying gap found at `(R, C_gap)` with color `C`:
    a.  Fill the gap in the **output grid**: Set `output_grid[R, C_gap] = C`.
    b.  Draw a vertical ray upwards in the **output grid**:
        i.  Set the drawing column `col = C_gap`.
        ii. For each row `r` from `R - 1` down to 0 (inclusive):
            1. Set `output_grid[r, col] = C` (overwriting any existing pixel).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
