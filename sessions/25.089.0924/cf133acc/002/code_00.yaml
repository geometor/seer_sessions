elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
      contains:
        - colored_pixels
        - objects

  - type: object
    subtype: horizontal_line_segment
    properties:
      color: C (any color 1-9)
      orientation: horizontal
      structure: contiguous segment of color C

  - type: object
    subtype: gapped_horizontal_line
    description: A potential target for transformation.
    properties:
      color: C (any color 1-9)
      orientation: horizontal
      location: row R
      structure: Consists of one or more horizontal_line_segments of color C, separated by exactly one white (0) pixel (the gap) at column C_gap.
      condition: The total horizontal span (sum of segment lengths + 1 for the gap) must be >= 3.

  - type: location
    subtype: gap
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      position: (R, C_gap) within a gapped_horizontal_line

actions:
  - name: find_qualifying_gaps
    input: grid
    output: list of tuples (line_color C, gap_row R, gap_col C_gap)
    description: Identifies all single-pixel white gaps within horizontal lines of a single color where the total span (line parts + gap) is 3 or more pixels.

  - name: fill_gap
    input: grid, gap_location (R, C_gap), fill_color C
    output: modified grid
    effect: Sets the pixel value at (R, C_gap) to C.

  - name: draw_overwriting_vertical_ray_upwards
    input: grid, start_row R_start (row above the gap), column C_ray, color C_ray
    output: modified grid
    effect:
      - Iterate row `r` from `R_start` down to 0.
      - For each `r`, set grid[r, C_ray] = C_ray.
    constraints: This action unconditionally overwrites any existing pixel values in its path from R_start up to row 0.

relationships:
  - The `fill_gap` action uses the `line_color` of the `gapped_horizontal_line`.
  - The `draw_overwriting_vertical_ray_upwards` action is triggered for each filled gap.
  - The ray starts at `R - 1` (where R is the row of the filled gap) and `C_gap`.
  - The ray uses the same `line_color` (C) as the filled gap.
  - Pixels in the grid not explicitly modified by `fill_gap` or `draw_overwriting_vertical_ray_upwards` retain their original values from the input grid.
