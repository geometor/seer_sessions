            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: finding horizontal lines with single-pixel gaps, filling the gaps, and projecting a ray upwards. The provided code attempted to implement this. However, the comparison between the `Transformed Output` (generated by the code) and the `Expected Output` revealed discrepancies in all examples.\n\nThe discrepancies consistently showed that the `Transformed Output` was missing vertical line segments that were present below the horizontal gapped line in the `Input` and `Expected Output`. This suggests the error wasn't in the *upward* ray logic itself, but potentially in how the initial state was handled or how the comparison was performed.\n\nHowever, a closer look at the Input -> Expected Output pairs, ignoring the potentially incorrect `Transformed Output` provided in the results, reveals a consistent pattern:\n1.  The single white gap in qualifying horizontal lines is filled with the line's color.\n2.  A vertical ray of the *same color* extends *upwards* from the row directly above the filled gap, in the same column.\n3.  This ray continues to the top edge of the grid, overwriting *any* pixel (white or colored) in its path.\n4.  All pixels *not* part of the filled gap or the upward ray path remain exactly as they were in the input grid.\n\nThe original code had a condition `if output_grid[ray_r, gap_col] != 0: break` in the ray-drawing loop. This would incorrectly stop the ray if it encountered *any* non-white pixel, whereas the rule derived from the examples suggests the ray should overwrite everything in its path upwards.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Trust the Input -> Expected Output pairs as the ground truth for the transformation rule.\n2.  Refine the natural language program and YAML facts to precisely describe the observed rule, specifically the unconditional upward overwriting behavior of the ray.\n3.  Correct the code implementation to remove the condition that prematurely stops the ray.\n\n**Metrics (Based on Input -> Expected Output):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 15x15\n    *   Gaps Found:\n        *   (Row 9, Col 3), Color 2, Span 8 (>=3) -> Fill (9,3) with 2, Ray up from (8,3) with 2.\n        *   (Row 9, Col 9), Color 3, Span 7 (>=3) -> Fill (9,9) with 3, Ray up from (8,9) with 3.\n    *   Pixels Changed: 1 (gap fill) + 9 (ray) + 1 (gap fill) + 9 (ray) = 20 pixels.\n    *   Preserved Pixels: Original vertical lines (Green at col 3, Yellow at col 9, below row 9) are preserved.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 15x15\n    *   Gaps Found:\n        *   (Row 3, Col 3), Color 3, Span 7 (>=3) -> Fill (3,3) with 3, Ray up from (2,3) with 3.\n        *   (Row 6, Col 9), Color 6, Span 9 (>=3) -> Fill (6,9) with 6, Ray up from (5,9) with 6.\n        *   (Row 8, Col 3), Color 4, Span 7 (>=3) -> Fill (8,3) with 4, Ray up from (7,3) with 4.\n        *   (Row 8, Col 9), Color 7, Span 7 (>=3) -> Fill (8,9) with 7, Ray up from (7,9) with 7.\n    *   Pixels Changed: (1+3) + (1+6) + (1+8) + (1+8) = 29 pixels.\n    *   Preserved Pixels: Original vertical lines (Blue at col 3, Gray at col 9, below row 8) are preserved.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 15x15\n    *   Gaps Found:\n        *   (Row 3, Col 1), Color 8, Span 6 (>=3) -> Fill (3,1) with 8, Ray up from (2,1) with 8.\n        *   (Row 2, Col 9), Color 7, Span 9 (>=3) -> Fill (2,9) with 7, Ray up from (1,9) with 7.\n        *   (Row 5, Col 9), Color 6, Span 9 (>=3) -> Fill (5,9) with 6, Ray up from (4,9) with 6.\n        *   (Row 8, Col 1), Color 3, Span 6 (>=3) -> Fill (8,1) with 3, Ray up from (7,1) with 3.\n        *   (Row 11, Col 1), Color 9, Span 6 (>=3) -> Fill (11,1) with 9, Ray up from (10,1) with 9.\n        *   (Row 11, Col 9), Color 5, Span 9 (>=3) -> Fill (11,9) with 5, Ray up from (10,9) with 5.\n        *   (Row 14, Col 1), Color 1, Span 3 (>=3) -> Fill (14,1) with 1, Ray up from (13,1) with 1.\n        *   (Row 14, Col 9), Color 1, Span 3 (>=3) -> Fill (14,9) with 1, Ray up from (13,9) with 1.\n    *   Pixels Changed: (1+3) + (1+2) + (1+5) + (1+8) + (1+11) + (1+11) + (1+14) + (1+14) = 74 pixels.\n    *   Preserved Pixels: All other original pixels are preserved.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
