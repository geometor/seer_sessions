The overall size and most pixel colors remain the same between input and output.\n2.  **Key Change:** The core transformation involves filling certain white (0) areas within the grid with a specific color.\n3.  **Identifying the Fill Color:** In each example, there appears to be a single, unique pixel of a non-white color that dictates the fill color. This pixel seems \"isolated\" in that it doesn't have any neighbors (including diagonals) of the same color.\n    *   Train 1: Orange (7) pixel at the bottom right determines the fill color.\n    *   Train 2: Yellow (4) pixel at the bottom left determines the fill color.\n    *   Train 3: Yellow (4) pixel enclosed within a green object determines the fill color.\n    *   Train 4: Yellow (4) pixel at the bottom right determines the fill color.\n4.  **Identifying Areas to Fill:** The areas being filled are contiguous regions of white (0) pixels that are completely enclosed or surrounded by non-white pixels. These look like the \"insides\" of shapes or loops.\n5.  **No Other Changes:** Pixels that are not part of these enclosed white regions, and are not the isolated source pixel, retain their original color from the input. The non-white pixels forming the boundaries of the filled areas also remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

A pixel is isolated if none of its eight neighbours (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) share the same color. Record the color of this isolated pixel; this is the `fill_color`.\n2.  Identify all connected regions of white (0) pixels within the input grid.\n3.  For each identified white region, check if it is completely enclosed by non-white pixels. A region is enclosed if none of its constituent white pixels are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to the grid's border or to another white pixel that eventually connects to the border.\n4.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n5.  For every white pixel identified as part of a completely enclosed region in step 3, change its color in the output grid to the `fill_color` determined in step 1.\n6.  All other pixels in the output grid retain their original colors from the input grid."
