Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Contains a background color, typically green (3).
    - Contains at least one 'source' row featuring orange (7) pixels mixed with green (3) pixels.
  Objects:
    - Background: Contiguous areas of green (3).
    - Source Row Pattern: A sequence of orange (7) and green (3) pixels in a specific row.

Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Same dimensions as the input grid.
    - Contains all pixels from the input grid.
    - Contains additional pixels: magenta (6) and orange (7).
  Objects:
    - Generated Pixels: Magenta (6) and Orange (7) pixels added based on rules.

Transformations:
  - Action: Pattern Detection and Pixel Placement.
  - Rule 1 (Magenta Generation):
      - Trigger: A horizontal sequence `orange (7) - green (3) - orange (7)` found in a row `R` at column `C` (for the green pixel).
      - Effect: Place a magenta (6) pixel at row `R+2`, column `C` in the output grid.
  - Rule 2 (Orange Generation):
      - Trigger: A horizontal sequence `magenta (6) - green (3) - magenta (6)` found in a row `R` at column `C` (for the green pixel).
      - Effect: Place an orange (7) pixel at row `R+2`, column `C` in the output grid.
  - Process: Iterative Application.
      - Start with the source row(s) from the input.
      - Apply Rule 1 and Rule 2 to generate new pixels two rows below.
      - Treat rows containing newly generated pixels as potential sources for subsequent iterations.
      - Continue applying rules iteratively until no new pixels are generated in an iteration.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: New pixels are placed two rows directly below the center of the triggering 3-pixel horizontal pattern.
  - Dependency: The placement of orange (7) pixels depends on the prior placement of magenta (6) pixels, which in turn depends on the initial orange (7) patterns (or patterns generated in previous iterations).
  - Color Mapping: Input orange (7) influences magenta (6) generation; generated magenta (6) influences orange (7) generation.
