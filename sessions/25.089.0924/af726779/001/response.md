"""
Identify horizontal 3-pixel patterns and generate new pixels two rows below based on these patterns, iterating until no new patterns are generated.

1. Rule 1 (Magenta Generation): If a horizontal sequence 'orange (7) - green (3) - orange (7)' is found centered at (R, C), place a magenta (6) pixel at (R+2, C).
2. Rule 2 (Orange Generation): If a horizontal sequence 'magenta (6) - green (3) - magenta (6)' is found centered at (R, C), place an orange (7) pixel at (R+2, C).
3. Process: Apply these rules iteratively. Start by checking the initial grid. In each subsequent iteration, check rows where new pixels might have been added or rows that could trigger based on newly added pixels. Continue until an iteration occurs where no new pixels are added.
