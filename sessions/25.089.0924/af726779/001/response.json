Rule 1 (Magenta Generation): If a horizontal sequence 'orange (7) - green (3) - orange (7)' is found centered at (R, C), place a magenta (6) pixel at (R+2, C).\n2. Rule 2 (Orange Generation): If a horizontal sequence 'magenta (6) - green (3) - magenta (6)' is found centered at (R, C), place an orange (7) pixel at (R+2, C).\n3.
