            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial hypothesis, that a white pixel turns yellow if it has exactly three azure neighbors (including diagonals), failed to accurately reproduce the expected outputs for the training examples.\n\n*   **Example 1:** The rule generated 28 yellow pixels, while the target has 39. There were 14 false positives (pixels the rule turned yellow, but shouldn't have) and 25 false negatives (pixels the rule failed to turn yellow). Notably, the rule incorrectly colored pixels on the inner boundary of the hollow shapes and failed to color pixels forming larger yellow areas (like the 2x2 block near the left side) or isolated pixels far from the main boundary (like the single pixel at the top).\n*   **Example 2:** The rule generated 44 yellow pixels, while the target has 44. However, the *locations* are incorrect. There were 37 false positives and 37 false negatives. Similar error patterns occurred \u2013 incorrect coloring of inner boundary pixels and failure to color required pixels, including larger triangular fills.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Error Pixels:** Use code execution to precisely identify the coordinates of false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) pixels for each example.\n2.  **Characterize Neighborhoods:** For both FP and FN pixels, analyze their 3x3 neighborhood in the original *input* grid. Count azure neighbors, white neighbors, and note their configuration.\n3.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for patterns distinguishing correct yellow pixels from FPs and FNs. Revisit hypotheses like the 2x2 corner completion (`[[W,A],[A,A]]`), but apply filtering conditions. Check if FNs often have 2 or 4 azure neighbors, or if FPs correspond to specific \"inner corner\" configurations.\n4.  **Refine Rule:** Develop a more complex rule, potentially involving multiple conditions or steps:\n    *   Maybe a primary rule identifies candidates (e.g., based on 2x2 patterns or neighbor counts).\n    *   A secondary rule filters candidates (e.g., removing inner corners based on local topology or connection to the outer background).\n    *   A possible tertiary rule could handle propagation or filling (e.g., completing 2x2 yellow blocks if 3 corners are already yellow).\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n"
