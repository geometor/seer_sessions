## Assessment and Strategy

The initial hypothesis ("a white pixel becomes yellow if it has exactly 3 azure neighbors") generated output that differed significantly from the expected output for both training examples.

*   **False Positives:** The rule incorrectly colored white pixels yellow when those pixels were located at "inner corners" of hollow azure shapes (e.g., pixel (2,3) in train_1). These pixels *do* have 3 azure neighbors but should remain white.
*   **False Negatives:** The rule failed to color many white pixels yellow. These pixels often had fewer than 3 azure neighbors in the input grid but were located near other yellow pixels in the output, suggesting either a different primary rule or a secondary propagation/filling rule (e.g., pixel (5,1) in train_1).

The strategy is to:
1.  Analyze the discrepancies (False Positives and False Negatives) in detail.
2.  Re-evaluate the neighborhood patterns that lead to a white pixel becoming yellow.
3.  Formulate a refined rule that correctly handles both the inner corners (preventing False Positives) and the missed exterior pixels (preventing False Negatives). The rule likely involves specific 2x2 patterns or a combination of neighbor counts and relative positions, possibly with a filter based on geometric context (interior vs. exterior).

## Metrics Analysis

Let's analyze the differences between the expected output and the output generated by the "exactly 3 azure neighbors" rule.
