            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial hypothesis (\"a white pixel becomes yellow if it has exactly 3 azure neighbors\") generated output that differed significantly from the expected output for both training examples.\n\n*   **False Positives:** The rule incorrectly colored white pixels yellow when those pixels were located at \"inner corners\" of hollow azure shapes (e.g., pixel (2,3) in train_1). These pixels *do* have 3 azure neighbors but should remain white.\n*   **False Negatives:** The rule failed to color many white pixels yellow. These pixels often had fewer than 3 azure neighbors in the input grid but were located near other yellow pixels in the output, suggesting either a different primary rule or a secondary propagation/filling rule (e.g., pixel (5,1) in train_1).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Analyze the discrepancies (False Positives and False Negatives) in detail.\n2.  Re-evaluate the neighborhood patterns that lead to a white pixel becoming yellow.\n3.  Formulate a refined rule that correctly handles both the inner corners (preventing False Positives) and the missed exterior pixels (preventing False Negatives). The rule likely involves specific 2x2 patterns or a combination of neighbor counts and relative positions, possibly with a filter based on geometric context (interior vs. exterior).\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the differences between the expected output and the output generated by the \"exactly 3 azure neighbors\" rule.\n\n"
