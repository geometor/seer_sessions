-   The convex hull hypothesis is incorrect. The yellow pixels are not simply filling the gaps between the object and its convex hull boundary. Some calculated hull boundary points aren't yellow, and many yellow points are far outside the hull boundary.

-   Let's reconsider the local neighborhood idea, but maybe look at a larger neighborhood or specific patterns.
-   Pattern: A white pixel `W` becomes yellow if it sits in a 2x2 square where the other 3 pixels are azure?
    -   Consider pixel (1, 6) -> yellow.
        
```
        (0,5)W (0,6)W
        (1,5)W (1,6)W -> becomes Y
        ```

        Check 2x2 blocks involving (1,6):
        -   TL=(0,5), TR=(0,6), BL=(1,5), BR=(1,6): W,W,W,W -> No
        -   TL=(0,6), TR=(0,7), BL=(1,6), BR=(1,7): W,W,W,W -> No
        -   TL=(1,5), TR=(1,6), BL=(2,5), BR=(2,6): W,W,A,A -> No (only 2 A)
        -   TL=(1,6), TR=(1,7), BL=(2,6), BR=(2,7): W,W,A,A -> No (only 2 A)
    This 2x2 pattern doesn't seem right.

-   What if we consider a white pixel `W` and its diagonal azure neighbor `A_diag`. Does `W` become yellow if its two orthogonal neighbors adjacent to `A_diag` are also azure?
    -   Pixel (1, 6) -> Yellow. Diagonal azure neighbors: (2,5)A, (2,7)A.
        -   Consider A_diag = (2, 5). Orthogonal neighbors adjacent to (2,5) are (1,5)W and (2,6)A. Does not fit (need W, A).
        -   Consider A_diag = (2, 7). Orthogonal neighbors adjacent to (2,7) are (1,7)W and (2,6)A. Does not fit.
    -   Pixel (4, 2) -> Yellow. Diagonal azure neighbors: (3,3)A, (5,3)A.
        -   Consider A_diag = (3, 3). Orthogonal neighbors are (4,3)A and (3,2)W. Does not fit.
        -   Consider A_diag = (5, 3). Orthogonal neighbors are (4,3)A and (5,2)W. Does not fit.

-   Let's simplify. The yellow pixels seem to "fill in" corners or dents in the background adjacent to the azure objects.
-   Consider a white pixel `W`. If it has *exactly two* orthogonal azure neighbors, does it become yellow?
    -   Pixel (1, 6): Neighbors (2,6)A. Only 1 orthogonal A. -> No.
    -   Pixel (4, 2): Neighbors (4,3)A. Only 1 orthogonal A. -> No.
    -   Pixel (5, 1): No orthogonal A neighbors. -> No.
    -   Pixel (1, 5): Neighbors (2,5)A. Only 1 orthogonal A. -> No.
    -   Pixel (4, 10): Neighbors (3,10)W, (5,10)W, (4,9)A, (4,11)W. Only 1 orthogonal A. -> No.
    -   Pixel (16, 5): No orthogonal A neighbors. -> No.
    This rule doesn't work.

-   Consider a white pixel `W`. If it has *at least two* orthogonal or diagonal azure neighbors, AND these neighbors form a "corner" (i.e., they are adjacent to each other)?
    -   Pixel (1, 6) -> Y. Neighbors: (2,5)A, (2,6)A, (2,7)A. Neighbors (2,5) and (2,6) are adjacent. Neighbors (2,6) and (2,7) are adjacent. This fits.
    -   Pixel (4, 2) -> Y. Neighbors: (3,3)A, (4,3)A, (5,3)A. Neighbors (3,3) and (4,3) are adjacent. Neighbors (4,3) and (5,3) are adjacent. This fits.
    -   Pixel (5, 1) -> Y. No azure neighbors. -> Does not fit. Still problematic.
    -   Pixel (16, 5) -> Y. No azure neighbors. -> Does not fit. Still problematic.

-   What about the pixels like (5, 1) and (16, 5)? They are quite far from the azure objects in train_1.
    -   (5, 1) is 2 steps left and 2 steps up from the nearest azure pixel (3, 3).
    -   (16, 5) is 1 step up and 1 step left from the nearest azure pixel (17, 6).
-   This suggests the influence might propagate.

-   **Alternative Idea:** Identify all 2x2 squares containing exactly 3 azure pixels. The white pixel in such squares becomes yellow.
    -   Example: Square TL(1,5)W, TR(1,6)W, BL(2,5)A, BR(2,6)A. Count = 2. No change.
    -   Example: Square TL(3,2)W, TR(3,3)A, BL(4,2)W, BR(4,3)A. Count = 2. No change.
    -   Example: Square TL(2,3)W, TR(2,4)A, BL(3,3)A, BR(3,4)A. Count = 3. Pixel (2,3) should become yellow? It doesn't.
    This rule doesn't work.

-   **Alternative Idea 2:** Identify all 2x2 squares containing exactly 1 azure pixel. The diagonally opposite white pixel becomes yellow.
    -   Example: Square TL(3,2)W, TR(3,3)A, BL(4,2)W, BR(4,3)W. Count = 1. Pixel (4,2) should become yellow? It does.
    -   Example: Square TL(1,5)W, TR(1,6)W, BL(2,5)A, BR(2,6)W. Count = 1. Pixel (1,6) should become yellow? It does.
    -   Example: Square TL(1,7)W, TR(1,8)W, BL(2,7)A, BR(2,8)A. Count = 2. No change.
    -   Example: Square TL(2,8)A, TR(2,9)W, BL(3,8)W, BR(3,9)A. Count = 2. No change.
    -   Example: Square TL(8,2)W, TR(8,3)A, BL(9,2)W, BR(9,3)W. Count = 1. Pixel (9,2) should become yellow? Output has white at (9,2). This rule fails here.

-   Let's re-examine the problematic pixels (5, 1) and (16, 5) in train_1 output.
    -   (5, 1): It forms a yellow 2x2 block with (5,2), (6,1), (6,2).
    -   (16, 5): It's a single yellow pixel.

-   Maybe the rule involves the concept of "outside corners". An outside corner could be a white pixel `W` such that two orthogonal neighbors are white, but the diagonal pixel between them is azure. Let's call these "primary" yellow candidates.
    -   Pixel (1, 5): Neighbors (0,5)W, (1,4)W. Diagonal (0,4)W. Not a corner. Neighbors (0,5)W, (1,6)W. Diagonal (0,6)W. Not a corner. Neighbors (2,5)A, (1,4)W. Diagonal (2,4)A. Is (1,5) a corner? No.
    -   Let's define corner differently: A white pixel `W` where if you move diagonally towards an Azure pixel `A_diag`, the two intermediate orthogonal squares are white. This doesn't make sense.
    -   Definition: A white pixel `W` is an 'outer corner candidate' if it has exactly one orthogonal Azure neighbor `A_orth` and at least one diagonal Azure neighbor `A_diag` such that `A_diag` is also adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to `A_orth`.
        -   Pixel (1, 6): Ortho neighbor (2,6)A. Diagonal neighbors (2,5)A, (2,7)A.
            -   A_diag = (2,5). Is (2,5) adjacent to (2,6)? Yes. -> (1,6) is candidate.
            -   A_diag = (2,7). Is (2,7) adjacent to (2,6)? Yes. -> (1,6) is candidate.
        -   Pixel (4, 2): Ortho neighbor (4,3)A. Diagonal neighbors (3,3)A, (5,3)A.
            -   A_diag = (3,3). Is (3,3) adjacent to (4,3)? Yes. -> (4,2) is candidate.
            -   A_diag = (5,3). Is (5,3) adjacent to (4,3)? Yes. -> (4,2) is candidate.
        -   Pixel (1, 5): Ortho neighbor (2,5)A. Diagonal neighbors (2,4)A, (2,6)A.
            -   A_diag = (2,4). Is (2,4) adjacent to (2,5)? Yes. -> (1,5) is candidate.
            -   A_diag = (2,6). Is (2,6) adjacent to (2,5)? Yes. -> (1,5) is candidate.
    -   Let's list all candidates for Object 1 (top):
        (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) -> Yes, match output.
        (2,3) -> Ortho=(3,3)A. Diag=(2,4)A,(3,4)A. (2,4) adj (3,3)? No. (3,4) adj (3,3)? Yes. -> Candidate. Output is white. Rule fails.
        (2,9) -> Ortho=(3,9)A. Diag=(2,8)A,(3,8)A. (2,8) adj (3,9)? No. (3,8) adj (3,9)? Yes. -> Candidate. Output is white. Rule fails.
        (4,2) -> Yes, match output.
        (4,10) -> Yes, match output.
        (5,2) -> Ortho=(5,3)A. Diag=(4,3)A,(6,3)A. Both adjacent. -> Candidate. Output is yellow.
        (5,10) -> Ortho=(5,9)A. Diag=(4,9)A,(6,9)A. Both adjacent. -> Candidate. Output is yellow.
        (6,2) -> Ortho=(6,3)A. Diag=(5,3)A,(7,3)A. Both adjacent. -> Candidate. Output is yellow.
        (6,10) -> Ortho=(6,9)A. Diag=(5,9)A,(7,9)A. Both adjacent. -> Candidate. Output is yellow.
        (7,2) -> Ortho=(7,3)A. Diag=(6,3)A,(8,3)A. Both adjacent. -> Candidate. Output is yellow.
        (7,10) -> Ortho=(7,9)A. Diag=(6,9)A,(8,9)A. Both adjacent. -> Candidate. Output is yellow.
        (9,3) -> Ortho=(8,3)A. Diag=(8,4)A,(9,4)A. Both adjacent. -> Candidate. Output is white. Rule fails.
        (9,9) -> Ortho=(8,9)A. Diag=(8,8)A,(9,8)A. Both adjacent. -> Candidate. Output is white. Rule fails.
        (10,5), (10,6), (10,7) -> Yes, match output (partially, (10,5) is output yellow, (10,6) output yellow, (10,7) output yellow).

    -   This "outer corner candidate" rule identifies *some* yellow pixels but also some white pixels, and misses others entirely (like (5,1)).

-   **Final Hypothesis Attempt:** The yellow pixels fill the "negative space" immediately surrounding the azure objects, specifically targeting locations that smooth out concave corners or indentations in the background. A white pixel turns yellow if it is adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to *at least two* azure pixels that are *not adjacent* to each other.
    -   Pixel (1, 6) -> Y. Azure Neighbors: (2,5), (2,6), (2,7).
        -   Are (2,5) and (2,7) adjacent? No. Rule applies. -> (1,6) becomes Yellow.
    -   Pixel (4, 2) -> Y. Azure Neighbors: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3).
        -   Are (3,3) and (5,3) adjacent? No. Rule applies. -> (4,2) becomes Yellow.
    -   Pixel (5, 1) -> Y. Azure Neighbors: None. Rule does not apply. Still fails.
    -   Pixel (16, 5) -> Y. Azure Neighbors: (15,6), (16,6), (17,6).
        -   Are (15,6) and (17,6) adjacent? No. Rule applies. -> (16,5) becomes Yellow.
    -   Pixel (2, 3) -> W. Azure Neighbors: (2,4), (3,3), (3,4).
        -   (2,4) and (3,3)? No. Rule applies. -> Predicts Yellow. Output is White. Rule fails.
    -   Pixel (9, 3) -> W. Azure Neighbors: (8,3), (8,4), (9,4).
        -   (8,3) and (9,4)? No. Rule applies. -> Predicts Yellow. Output is White. Rule fails.

-   Let's consider the pixels that failed the previous rule: (2,3) and (9,3). These are 'inner' corners relative to the hollow shape. The rule seems to apply to 'outer' corners of the shape.
-   Maybe the rule is: A white pixel `W` turns yellow if it has at least two non-adjacent azure neighbors *AND* it lies outside the bounding box defined by the minimum and maximum row/column containing azure pixels in the respective object?
    -   Object 1 Bbox: rows 2-9, cols 3-9.
    -   Pixel (1, 6): Outside bbox. Neighbors (2,5)A, (2,7)A non-adjacent. -> Yellow. Correct.
    -   Pixel (4, 2): Outside bbox. Neighbors (3,3)A, (5,3)A non-adjacent. -> Yellow. Correct.
    -   Pixel (5, 1): Outside bbox. No azure neighbors. -> White. Incorrect. Still fails.
    -   Pixel (16, 5): Object 2 Bbox: rows 13-19, cols 6-17. Outside bbox. Neighbors (15,6)A, (17,6)A non-adjacent. -> Yellow. Correct.
    -   Pixel (2, 3): Inside bbox row, outside bbox col. Neighbors (2,4)A, (3,3)A non-adjacent. -> Yellow. Incorrect.
    -   Pixel (9, 3): Inside bbox row, outside bbox col. Neighbors (8,3)A, (9,4)A non-adjacent. -> Yellow. Incorrect.

-   This is surprisingly difficult. Let's reconsider (5,1) and the pixels around it: (5,1)Y, (5,2)Y, (6,1)Y, (6,2)Y form a 2x2 yellow block. Their input neighborhoods don't obviously trigger anything simple.
-   Is it about propagation? Find initial yellow pixels using a rule, then maybe yellow pixels propagate to neighbors under certain conditions?
-   Rule: Find white pixels `W` with >= 2 non-adjacent azure neighbors (ortho or diag). Mark them Yellow (Set P1).
-   Rule: Find white pixels `W` that form a 2x2 square with 3 yellow pixels from P1. Mark them Yellow (Set P2).
-   Let's try this on Object 1.
    -   P1 candidates (based on non-adjacent azure neighbors): (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (4,2), (4,10), (5,2)*, (5,10)*, (6,2)*, (6,10)*, (7,2)*, (7,10)*, (10,5), (10,6), (10,7). Asterisk means adjacent to >=3 azure. Let's refine: >=2 non-adjacent azure neighbors.
        - (1,5): A=(2,4), A=(2,6). Non-adj. -> Y
        - (1,6): A=(2,5), A=(2,7). Non-adj. -> Y
        - (1,7): A=(2,6), A=(2,8). Non-adj. -> Y
        - (4,2): A=(3,3), A=(5,3). Non-adj. -> Y
        - (4,10): A=(3,9), A=(5,9). Non-adj. -> Y
        - (5,2): A=(4,3), A=(6,3). Non-adj. -> Y
        - (5,10): A=(4,9), A=(6,9). Non-adj. -> Y
        - (6,2): A=(5,3), A=(7,3). Non-adj. -> Y
        - (6,10): A=(5,9), A=(7,9). Non-adj. -> Y
        - (7,2): A=(6,3), A=(8,3). Non-adj. -> Y
        - (7,10): A=(6,9), A=(8,9). Non-adj. -> Y
        - (10,5): A=(9,4), A=(9,6). Non-adj. -> Y
        - (10,6): A=(9,5), A=(9,7). Non-adj. -> Y
        - (10,7): A=(9,6), A=(9,8). Non-adj. -> Y
        - Are there others? Check (5,1). No azure neighbors.
    -   P1 set: {(1,5),(1,6),(1,7), (4,2),(4,10), (5,2),(5,10), (6,2),(6,10), (7,2),(7,10), (10,5),(10,6),(10,7)}.
    -   Now check 2x2 completion. Consider (5,1). Does it form 2x2 with 3 pixels from P1?
        -   Square TL(4,1)W, TR(4,2)Y, BL(5,1)W, BR(5,2)Y. No.
        -   Square TL(5,1)W, TR(5,2)Y, BL(6,1)W, BR(6,2)Y. No.
        -   Square TL(5,0)W, TR(5,1)W, BL(6,0)W, BR(6,1)W. No.
    -   This propagation rule doesn't explain (5,1).

-   Let's look at the *shape* of the yellow pixels relative to the azure. They often form triangles pointing outwards from corners.
    -   Around the top point of Object 1 (approx row 2, col 6): Yellow pixels at (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) and (0,6). This forms a triangle shape pointing up.
    -   Around the left point (approx row 5, col 3): Yellows at (4,2), (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (6,2), (7,2). Forms a triangle pointing left.
    -   Around the bottom point of Object 2 (approx row 19, col 11): Yellows at (20,9)...(20,13) and (21,10)...(21,12). Forms triangle pointing down.

-   Hypothesis: Identify the "outer boundary" pixels of the azure shapes. For each segment of the outer boundary, if it forms a concave angle (from the outside perspective), fill the corner with yellow pixels forming a triangle.
    -   This seems plausible but hard to define formally. "Concave angle from the outside" means a convex angle from the inside/object perspective.
    -   Consider the top point of Object 1. The boundary goes from (3,3) -> (2,4) -> (2,8) -> (3,9). The angle at the top involves (2,4) to (2,8). This isn't really a corner.
    -   Consider the left corner: (3,3) -> (8,3). The change in direction happens going from row 2 to row 3 (col 4 to 3) and row 8 to row 9 (col 3 to 4).
    -   Let's focus on pixels with exactly one orthogonal azure neighbor. These are often edge pixels.
    -   Pixel W turns yellow if it completes a 2x2 square pattern `[[W, A], [A, A]]` or rotations/reflections, where A is Azure.
        -   Check (1, 6) -> Y.
            - `[[W(0,6), A(0,7)], [W(1,6), A(1,7)]]` No.
            - `[[A(1,5), A(1,6)], [A(2,5), W(2,6)]]` No.
            - `[[A(1,5), W(1,6)], [A(2,5), A(2,6)]]` Yes, W=(1,6). Makes (1,6) yellow.
            - `[[W(1,6), A(1,7)], [A(2,6), A(2,7)]]` Yes, W=(1,6). Makes (1,6) yellow.
        -   Check (4, 2) -> Y.
            - `[[W(3,2), A(3,3)], [W(4,2), A(4,3)]]` Yes, W=(4,2). Makes (4,2) yellow.
            - `[[W(4,2), A(4,3)], [W(5,2), A(5,3)]]` Yes, W=(4,2). Makes (4,2) yellow.
        -   Check (5, 1) -> Y.
            - `[[W(4,1), W(4,2)], [W(5,1), W(5,2)]]` No A.
        -   Check (16, 5) -> Y.
            - `[[W(15,5), A(15,6)], [W(16,5), A(16,6)]]` Yes, W=(16,5). Makes (16,5) yellow.
            - `[[W(16,5), A(16,6)], [W(17,5), A(17,6)]]` Yes, W=(16,5). Makes (16,5) yellow.
        - Check (2, 3) -> W.
            - `[[W(1,3), W(1,4)], [W(2,3), A(2,4)]]` No.
            - `[[W(2,3), A(2,4)], [A(3,3), A(3,4)]]` Yes, W=(2,3). Predicts Yellow! Fails.
        - Check (0, 6) -> Y.
             - `[[W(-1,...),...], [W(0,6), A(0,7)]]` No.
             - `[[W(0,5), W(0,6)], [A(1,5), A(1,6)]]` No. Needs 3 A's.
             - `[[A(0,5), W(0,6)], [A(1,5), A(1,6)]]` No.
             - `[[W(0,6), A(0,7)], [A(1,6), A(1,7)]]` No.
    -   This "completing 3 A's in 2x2" rule seems promising but fails on internal corners and misses some external ones like (0,6).

-   Let's try the rule from task `00d62c1b`: Color a background pixel if it touches (adjacency including diagonal) exactly 3 pixels of the object color.
    -   Pixel (1, 6) -> Y. Neighbors: (2,5)A, (2,6)A, (2,7)A. Count = 3. -> Yellow. Correct.
    -   Pixel (4, 2) -> Y. Neighbors: (3,3)A, (4,3)A, (5,3)A. Count = 3. -> Yellow. Correct.
    -   Pixel (5, 1) -> Y. Neighbors: None. Count = 0. -> White. Incorrect.
    -   Pixel (16, 5) -> Y. Neighbors: (15,6)A, (16,6)A, (17,6)A. Count = 3. -> Yellow. Correct.
    -   Pixel (0, 6) -> Y. Neighbors: (1,5)W->Y, (1,6)Y, (1,7)Y. Azure neighbors: (2,5)A, (2,6)A, (2,7)A. Count = 3. -> Yellow. Correct.
    -   Pixel (1, 5) -> Y. Neighbors: (2,4)A, (2,5)A, (2,6)A. Count = 3. -> Yellow. Correct.
    -   Pixel (2, 3) -> W. Neighbors: (2,4)A, (3,3)A, (3,4)A. Count = 3. -> Yellow. Incorrect.
    -   Pixel (9, 3) -> W. Neighbors: (8,3)A, (8,4)A, (9,4)A. Count = 3. -> Yellow. Incorrect.

-   The "exactly 3 azure neighbors" rule works for many external corners but fails for internal corners (predicts yellow when it should be white) and misses some cases like (5,1).

-   What is special about (5,1)? It's part of a 2x2 yellow block: (5,1),(5,2),(6,1),(6,2).
    -   (5,2): Neighbors (4,3)A, (5,3)A, (6,3)A. Count = 3. -> Yellow.
    -   (6,1): Neighbors (5,?) No azure. Count = 0. -> White. Incorrect.
    -   (6,2): Neighbors (5,3)A, (6,3)A, (7,3)A. Count = 3. -> Yellow.
-   It seems the rule is:
    1. Find all white pixels with exactly 3 azure neighbors (ortho or diag). Mark these as potential yellow (Set P1).
    2. The final yellow pixels are those in P1 that are *not* inside the original azure object's "hole". How to define the hole? Maybe pixels surrounded entirely by azure/P1 pixels? Or maybe pixels that are "inside" the shape topologically.
    3. Or, perhaps, P1 pixels that are on the "outside" boundary. Pixels like (2,3) and (9,3) are on the boundary of the *inner* hole. Pixels like (1,6), (4,2) are on the *outer* boundary.

-   How to distinguish inner vs outer boundary? Maybe check if a path exists from the pixel to the edge of the grid using only white pixels.
    -   (2,3): Path to edge? Yes.
    -   (1,6): Path to edge? Yes. This doesn't distinguish.

-   Alternative distinction: Convex hull. Pixels outside the convex hull?
    -   Hull vertices for Obj1: (2,4), (2,8), (3,3), (3,9), (8,3), (8,9), (9,4), (9,8).
    -   Pixel (1,6) is outside hull. Neighbors=3. -> Yellow.
    -   Pixel (4,2) is outside hull. Neighbors=3. -> Yellow.
    -   Pixel (2,3) is outside hull. Neighbors=3. -> Yellow. Incorrect.
    -   Pixel (9,3) is outside hull. Neighbors=3. -> Yellow. Incorrect.

-   Okay, let's assume the "exactly 3 azure neighbors" rule generates a candidate set. How are the incorrect candidates (2,3), (9,3), (2,9), (9,9) for obj1 filtered out?
-   These points are adjacent to the "inner" boundary of the hollow shape. The correct points are adjacent to the "outer" boundary.
-   Maybe it's about the number of *white* neighbors?
    -   (1,6): 5 white neighbors (0,5),(0,6),(0,7),(1,5),(1,7).
    -   (4,2): 5 white neighbors (3,1),(3,2),(4,1),(5,1),(5,2).
    -   (2,3): 5 white neighbors (1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,2),(3,2).
    -   (9,3): 5 white neighbors (8,2),(9,2),(10,2),(10,3),(10,4).
    This doesn't distinguish.

-   Focus on the pattern: The rule seems to fill the 1-pixel deep indentations on the *outside* of the shapes.
-   An "outside indentation" white pixel is one where moving diagonally outwards leads to more white space, while moving diagonally inwards hits the object.
-   A white pixel W turns yellow if it has exactly 3 azure neighbors (orthogonally or diagonally).

This seems like the most likely simple rule, even though it fails on the "inner corners" like (2,3). Perhaps there's a subtlety missed, or the examples provided are somehow special cases where inner corners aren't filled. Let's assume this rule for now. The failure cases (2,3), (9,3) etc. are white in the output. Why would they be excluded?

Final refined hypothesis:
1. Identify all azure pixels (color 8).
2. Iterate through all white pixels (color 0) in the input grid.
3. For each white pixel, count its azure neighbors (orthogonally and diagonally adjacent).
4. If a white pixel has exactly 3 azure neighbors, change its color to yellow (4) in the output grid.
5. All other pixels retain their original color (azure stays azure, white with != 3 azure neighbors stay white).

Let's re-check the problematic pixel (5,1) which becomes yellow but has 0 neighbors. And (0,6) which becomes yellow but has 3 azure neighbors at distance 2.
Wait, (0,6) has neighbours (1,5)Y, (1,6)Y, (1,7)Y. If the rule is applied iteratively, maybe? No, the rules are usually applied simultaneously to the input state.
The pixel (0,6) neighbors in INPUT are: (0,5)W, (0,7)W, (1,5)W, (1,6)W, (1,7)W. Diagonal: (1,5)W, (1,7)W. Total Azure neighbours = 0. Yet it becomes yellow.

This implies the "exactly 3 neighbours" rule is incorrect.

Let's reconsider the 2x2 pattern `[[W, A], [A, A]]` or rotations. Color W yellow.
-   (1,6) -> Y. Covered by `[[A(1,5), W(1,6)], [A(2,5), A(2,6)]]` and `[[W(1,6), A(1,7)], [A(2,6), A(2,7)]]`.
-   (4,2) -> Y. Covered by `[[W(3,2), A(3,3)], [W(4,2), A(4,3)]]` and `[[W(4,2), A(4,3)], [W(5,2), A(5,3)]]`.
-   (16,5) -> Y. Covered by `[[W(15,5), A(15,6)], [W(16,5), A(16,6)]]` and `[[W(16,5), A(16,6)], [W(17,5), A(17,6)]]`.
-   (0,6) -> Y. Check 2x2s involving (0,6). None have 3 'A's. Fails.
-   (5,1) -> Y. Check 2x2s involving (5,1). None have 3 'A's. Fails.
-   (2,3) -> W. Covered by `[[W(2,3), A(2,4)], [A(3,3), A(3,4)]]`. Predicts Yellow. Fails.

What if the rule applies only to *specific* colours? Here, only Azure (8) seems relevant.
What if the rule is applied *per object*?
Maybe it's about the background grid points *equidistant* from two points on the object boundary?

Let's step back.
Input has azure objects on white background.
Output adds yellow pixels.
The yellow pixels are clustered around the azure objects.
They seem to fill "outer corners" or "dents".
The patterns look like small triangles or lines.

Consider a white pixel. If it is orthogonally adjacent to exactly one azure pixel, AND diagonally adjacent to exactly two azure pixels, does it become yellow?
-   (1,6): Orth
