Okay, the initial hypothesis (white pixel -> yellow if exactly 3 azure neighbors) failed. It incorrectly colored pixels on the inner boundaries of hollow shapes (false positives) and missed many pixels that should have become yellow (false negatives).

**1. General Assessment and Strategy**

The core issue is that the local neighborhood condition (exactly 3 azure neighbors) is met by pixels on both the exterior and interior boundaries of the azure shapes, but only exterior boundary pixels should turn yellow. Additionally, some yellow pixels appear further away or in configurations not explained by the simple 3-neighbor rule.

The strategy is to:
1.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** Use code execution to precisely identify the false positives and false negatives from the previous attempt for both examples. This will highlight the specific locations and patterns that the rule failed to capture or incorrectly captured.
2.  **Refine Hypothesis:** Develop a multi-step hypothesis. The errors suggest a process involving:
    *   An initial seeding rule that potentially identifies more candidates than needed (like the `[[W,A],[A,A]]` 2x2 pattern, or the 3-neighbor rule).
    *   A filtering step to remove candidates on the "inner" boundaries.
    *   A propagation step where the initial filtered set influences adjacent white pixels to turn yellow, explaining pixels further from the original object or forming larger yellow shapes.
3.  **Formulate New Program:** Based on the refined hypothesis, write a new natural language program.

**2. Metrics Gathering**
