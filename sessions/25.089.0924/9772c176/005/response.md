Transformation Rule Hypothesis (v1 - Flawed):
Transforms the input grid by adding yellow pixels (4) based on adjacency to azure pixels (8).
The hypothesized rule is: A white pixel (0) becomes yellow (4) if it has exactly three azure (8) neighbors 
(counting both orthogonal and diagonal adjacency). 
All azure pixels (8) remain unchanged in the output.
All white pixels (0) that do not meet the condition remain white (0).
Other pixel colors, if present, remain unchanged.

NOTE: This rule was tested against the training examples and found to be insufficient. 
It incorrectly colors some pixels (typically those adjacent to 'inner' boundaries of hollow shapes) 
and fails to color others that should be yellow according to the examples. 
This implementation reflects the flawed hypothesis for iterative development.
