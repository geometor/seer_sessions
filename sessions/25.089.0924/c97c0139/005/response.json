For each identified red object:\n    a. Calculate its size 'L' (number of pixels).\n    b. Determine a maximum Manhattan distance threshold 'k' using the formula: k = floor((L - 1) / 2). Store this threshold associated with the object.\n3. Create a copy of the input grid.\n4. Iterate through every pixel (r, c) in the grid.\n5. If the pixel at (r, c) in the *original* input grid is white (color 0):\n    a. Check if this pixel should be colored azure: Iterate through each red object found earlier.\n    b. For the current red object, calculate the minimum Manhattan distance ('d_min') from the white pixel (r, c) to *any* pixel within that red object.\n    c. Retrieve the threshold 'k' calculated for this specific red object.\n    d. If the condition '0 < d_min <= k' is met:\n        i. The white pixel (r, c) qualifies to be colored azure.\n        ii. Change the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the *output grid* to azure (color 8).\n        iii. Stop checking other red objects for this white pixel (r, c) and move to the next pixel in the grid.\n6.
