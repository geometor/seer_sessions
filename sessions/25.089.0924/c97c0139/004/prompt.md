Transformation Rule:

1. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2. Identify all distinct connected objects composed of red pixels (color 2), considering 8-way connectivity (including diagonals).
3. For each identified red object:
    a. Calculate its size 'L' (the number of pixels in the object).
    b. Calculate a propagation distance threshold 'k' using the formula: k = floor((L - 1) / 2).
    c. If k is less than 1, this object generates no azure pixels, so skip to the next object.
    d. Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting simultaneously from all pixels of the current red object:
        i. Initialize a queue with all pixel coordinates of the current red object, each associated with a distance of 0.
        ii. Initialize a 'visited' grid or set to keep track of pixels that have been processed (initially marking all non-white pixels as visited). This prevents revisiting pixels colored red or azure (either initially or by a previous object's propagation).
        iii. While the queue is not empty:
            - Dequeue a pixel coordinate (r, c) and its distance 'd'.
            - If 'd' is already equal to the threshold 'k', do not explore its neighbors from this path, as they would exceed the distance limit.
            - Otherwise, examine the four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) of (r, c).
            - For each neighbor (nr, nc):
                - Check if it's within the grid boundaries.
                - Check if it has not been 'visited' yet.
                - If both checks pass (meaning it's within bounds and currently white):
                    - Mark the neighbor (nr, nc) as 'visited'.
                    - Change the color of the pixel at (nr, nc) in the output grid to azure (8).
                    - Enqueue the neighbor (nr, nc) with distance 'd + 1'.
4. After processing all red objects, return the modified output grid.
