Initial_State:
  Grid:
    Contains:
      - Background:
          Color: white (0)
          Coverage: Most of the grid
      - Objects:
          Type: Connected Components (8-way connectivity)
          Color: red (2)
          Quantity: One or more
Final_State:
  Grid:
    Contains:
      - Background:
          Color: white (0)
      - Original_Objects:
          Type: Connected Components
          Color: red (2)
          Persistence: Unchanged from input
      - Added_Pixels:
          Color: azure (8)
          Location: Pixels that were originally white (0).
Transformation_Rule:
  Action: Color specific white pixels azure based on proximity to red objects.
  Steps:
    - Identify distinct red (2) connected components (objects) using 8-way connectivity.
    - For each red object:
      - Calculate its size 'L' (pixel count).
      - Calculate a distance threshold 'k' using the formula: k = floor((L - 1) / 2). Store this k value associated with the object.
    - Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    - Iterate through every pixel location (row, col) in the input grid.
    - If the pixel at (row, col) in the *input grid* is white (0):
      - Initialize a flag `should_color_azure` to False.
      - For each identified red object `i`:
        - Calculate the minimum Manhattan distance `d_min_i` from (row, col) to any pixel within red object `i`.
        - Retrieve the threshold `k_i` calculated for red object `i`.
        - If `0 < d_min_i <= k_i`:
          - Set `should_color_azure` to True.
          - Break the inner loop (checking other red objects for this white pixel is unnecessary).
      - If `should_color_azure` is True after checking against all red objects:
        - Change the color of the pixel at (row, col) in the *output grid* to azure (8).
  Properties_Used:
    - Pixel Color
    - Pixel Coordinates
    - Object Connectivity (Connected Components, 8-way)
    - Object Size (Pixel Count)
    - Manhattan Distance
  Output_Color: azure (8) for modified pixels.
  Input_Colors_Unaffected: red (2) remains unchanged. Other non-white colors (if any) would also remain unchanged.
