            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code execution resulted in incorrect outputs for both training examples. The generated azure (8) regions were significantly larger than the expected diamond shapes. The core issue seems to be in how the influence of each red (2) object is calculated and applied. The BFS implementation with a shared `visited` array likely caused interference between the propagation zones of different objects or allowed propagation beyond the calculated limit `k` due to incorrect state management across iterations.\n\nThe strategy is to revert to a simpler, more direct calculation based on the initial hypothesis: for each potential azure pixel (initially white), calculate its minimum Manhattan distance to *each* red object independently. If this distance is within the calculated threshold `k` for *any* of the red objects, the pixel should be colored azure. This avoids the complexities and potential errors of iterative propagation (BFS) with shared state across object processing.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\n\n"
