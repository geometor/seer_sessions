            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist primarily of a white background (color 0) with one or more distinct objects composed of red pixels (color 2). These red objects appear as lines (horizontal or vertical) or potentially other contiguous shapes.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the original red objects from the input. Additionally, new shapes composed of azure pixels (color 8) appear. These azure shapes surround the red objects.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves generating these azure shapes based on the properties of the red objects.\n4.  **Shape Relationship:** The azure shapes resemble diamonds (or squares rotated 45 degrees) centered around the red objects. The size and extent of the azure diamond seem directly related to the corresponding red object.\n5.  **Distance Metric:** The azure pixels appear to occupy locations that are within a certain *Manhattan distance* (sum of absolute differences in row and column coordinates) from the nearest red pixel of a given object.\n6.  **Variable Threshold:** Comparing train_1 and train_2, the maximum distance for coloring a pixel azure changes. In train_1, the red line has 14 pixels, and the azure shape extends up to a Manhattan distance of 6. In train_2, the vertical red line (5 pixels) has an azure shape extending up to distance 2, and the horizontal red line (9 pixels) has an azure shape extending up to distance 4.\n7.  **Rule Discovery:** This suggests a rule where the maximum allowed Manhattan distance (`k`) for painting azure pixels around a red object depends on the size (`L`, number of pixels) of that red object. The observed relationship is `k = floor((L - 1) / 2)`.\n8.  **Process:** For each distinct red object, calculate its size `L`, determine the threshold `k`, and then color all white pixels azure if their minimum Manhattan distance to *any* pixel within *that specific* red object is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `k`.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
