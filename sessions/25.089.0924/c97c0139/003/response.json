Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n2. Identify all distinct connected objects composed of red pixels (color 2), considering 8-way connectivity (including diagonals).\n3. For each identified red object:\n    a. Calculate its size 'L' (the number of pixels in the object).\n    b. Calculate a propagation distance threshold 'k' using the formula: k = floor((L - 1) / 2).\n    c. If k is less than 1, this object generates no azure pixels, so skip to the next object.\n    d. Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting simultaneously from all pixels of the current red object:\n        i. Initialize a queue with all pixel coordinates of the current red object, each associated with a distance of 0.\n        ii. Initialize a 'visited' grid or set to keep track of pixels that have been processed (initially marking all non-white pixels as visited). This prevents revisiting pixels colored red or azure (either initially or by a previous object's propagation).\n        iii. While the queue is not empty:\n            - Dequeue a pixel coordinate (r, c) and its distance 'd'.\n            - If 'd' is already equal to the threshold 'k', do not explore its neighbors from this path, as they would exceed the distance limit.\n            - Otherwise, examine the four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) of (r, c).\n            - For each neighbor (nr, nc):\n                - Check if it's within the grid boundaries.\n                - Check if it has not been 'visited' yet.\n                - If both checks pass (meaning it's within bounds and currently white):\n                    - Mark the neighbor (nr, nc) as 'visited'.\n                    - Change the color of the pixel at (nr, nc) in the output grid to azure (8).\n                    - Enqueue the neighbor (nr, nc) with distance 'd + 1'.\n4. After processing all red objects, return the modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a transformation where diamond shapes (azure, color 8) are grown\n    around red objects (color 2).
