The formula gives `k=0` and the propagation loop wouldn't run. Correct.\n    *   Overlapping azure areas: If the propagation from two different objects tries to color the same white pixel, it gets colored azure. The order shouldn't matter. Correct.\n    *   Concave red shapes: The propagation should correctly fill outwards from all parts of the shape. Correct.## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components: red objects, the generation of azure shapes, and the relationship between the red object's size and the extent of the azure shape using Manhattan distance. The formula `k = floor((L - 1) / 2)` was correctly derived.\n\nHowever, the implementation of the distance check resulted in over-coloring. The code colored any white pixel whose minimum distance to *any* part of the red object was less than or equal to `k`. The expected output demonstrates a more constrained growth, resembling a diamond shape expanding outwards from the red object, limited by `k` steps.\n\nThe results show that the number of azure pixels generated by the previous code was significantly higher than expected in both examples.\n\n## Strategy for Resolution\n\nThe strategy is to replace the simple distance check with a method that mimics wave propagation or a breadth-first search (BFS) originating from the pixels of each red object.\n\n1.  Identify each red object and calculate its size `L` and corresponding distance threshold `k = floor((L - 1) / 2)`.\n2.  For each object, perform a constrained expansion:\n    *   Maintain a set of pixels to visit, initially containing the object's pixels.\n    *   Maintain a distance map (or track distance during BFS) initialized to 0 for the object's pixels and infinity elsewhere.\n    *   Iteratively explore neighbors (using Manhattan distance 1 neighbors):\n        *   For pixels reached at distance `d`, explore their white neighbors.\n        *   If a white neighbor is reached and its current recorded distance is greater than `d + 1`, update its distance to `d + 1`.\n        *   If `d + 1` is less than or equal to the object's specific threshold `k`, add this neighbor to the set of pixels to color azure *and* add it to the queue/set for the next iteration of exploration.\n3.  Perform this process for each red object independently. A pixel colored azure by one object's propagation remains azure.\n\nThis approach ensures that only pixels reachable within `k` steps *outward* from the object are colored, matching the diamond shape observed in the examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics were gathered to confirm the relationship between object size (`L`) and the extent of the azure region (`k`).\n\n"
