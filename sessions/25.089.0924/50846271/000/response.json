The size of the grid remains the same between input and output.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), gray (5), and red (2) in the input. The output introduces azure (8). White is the background color. Gray seems to form static structures or boundaries. Red pixels appear as distinct, sometimes clustered, elements. Azure pixels appear only in the output.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some white pixels (0) to azure (8). All other pixels (gray and red) retain their original color and position.\n4.  **Spatial Relationship:** The azure pixels in the output appear exclusively in positions that were white in the input and are located adjacent (including diagonally) to one or more red pixels (2) in the input grid.\n5.  **Rule:** The rule seems to be: identify all white pixels in the input grid. For each white pixel, check its eight neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals). If any neighbor is red, change the white pixel to azure in the output grid. If a pixel is not white, or if it is white but has no red neighbors, it remains unchanged in the output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
