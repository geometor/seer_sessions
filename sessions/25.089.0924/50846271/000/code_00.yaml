elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - cells: pixels
      - colors: [white, gray, red, azure] # white=0, gray=5, red=2, azure=8
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: one of the defined colors
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
      - neighbors: set of 8 adjacent pixels (including diagonals)

actions:
  - name: change_color
    input: pixel
    output: pixel
    conditions:
      - pixel color is white (0)
      - pixel has at least one neighbor whose color is red (2)
    result:
      - pixel color becomes azure (8)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: pixels
    definition: Pixels sharing an edge or a corner.

transformation_goal:
  - Modify the input grid to produce the output grid by applying the 'change_color' action where conditions are met, otherwise keeping the original pixel color.
