Grid Structure:
  - Background: Primarily white (0) pixels.
  - Pattern: Contains repeating 3x3 blocks of azure (8) pixels, separated by single lines of white (0) pixels.

Objects:
  - Trigger Pixels:
      - Properties:
          - Color is not white (0) and not azure (8).
          - Appear in pairs of the same color in each input grid.
          - Define the transformation area.
      - Coordinates: Found by scanning the grid for non-zero, non-eight values. Each color has exactly two coordinate pairs.
  - Transformation Rectangle:
      - Defined by: The minimum and maximum row and column coordinates derived from a pair of same-colored Trigger Pixels. The rectangle includes the boundary rows and columns.
      - Affected Pixels: Only white (0) pixels located within this rectangle.
  - Target Pixels:
      - Identity: White (0) pixels.
      - Location: Within the bounds of a Transformation Rectangle.
  - Unchanged Pixels:
      - Identity: All azure (8) pixels, regardless of location (inside or outside Transformation Rectangles). All pixels outside any Transformation Rectangle.

Actions:
  - Identify Trigger Pairs: Scan the input grid to find all pairs of pixels with the same color, excluding white (0) and azure (8). Record their colors and locations.
  - Define Rectangles: For each identified pair, calculate the bounding rectangle using their coordinates (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
  - Apply Transformation:
      - For each defined rectangle:
          - Iterate through all pixels within the rectangle's bounds (inclusive).
          - If a pixel's original color in the input grid is white (0):
              - Change its color to the trigger color associated with that rectangle in the output grid.
          - If a pixel's original color is anything other than white (0):
              - Keep its original color in the output grid.
  - Output Generation: Produce the final grid after applying transformations for all identified trigger pairs.
