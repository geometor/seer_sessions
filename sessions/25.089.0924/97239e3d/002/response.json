            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: pairs of non-white (0), non-azure (8) pixels defining rectangles for transformation. However, the transformation rule applied within these rectangles was too broad. The code changed both white (0) *and* azure (8) pixels to the trigger color, whereas the expected outputs show that only the white (0) pixels within the defined rectangle should be changed. The azure (8) pixels, which form the consistent background pattern, remain untouched even when inside the transformation rectangle.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is to refine the transformation rule: locate the trigger pixel pairs, determine their bounding rectangle, and then iterate *only* through the white (0) pixels within that rectangle, changing them to the trigger color. All other pixels, including the azure (8) pixels, should retain their original color from the input grid.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's verify the locations of trigger pixels and the content of the bounding boxes to confirm the refined hypothesis. We'll focus on Example 1.\n"
