Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently feature a repeating pattern: 3x3 blocks of azure (8) pixels separated by single lines of white (0) pixels. This creates a larger grid structure composed of these 4x4 meta-units (3x3 block + 1 line buffer).
2.  **Trigger Pixels:** Each input grid contains exactly two pixels of one or more specific colors (other than white '0' or azure '8'). In the examples, these are red (2), magenta (6), blue (1), orange (7), and green (3). These appear in pairs of the same color.
3.  **Transformation Areas:** The changes between input and output seem localized to rectangular regions. Observing the trigger pixel pairs, they appear to define the corners or boundaries of these transformation rectangles
```python

"""

Each pair defines the opposite corners of a rectangle. 
Within this rectangle (inclusive of the boundaries defined by the pair), all white ('0') and azure ('8') pixels 
are changed to the color of the pair that defined the rectangle. 
This process is repeated for all unique trigger colors found in the input.

"""
The transformation operates on an input grid characterized by a repeating pattern: 3x3 blocks of azure (8) pixels separated by single lines of white (0) pixels, forming a larger structure based on 4x4 meta-units.

1.  **Identify Trigger Pairs:** Locate pairs of identically colored pixels in the input grid, excluding white (0) and azure (8). These are "trigger" pixels. Each distinct color found (other than 0 or 8) will have exactly two pixels.
2.  **Define Bounding Boxes:** For each pair of trigger pixels with color `C` at coordinates `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)`, determine the inclusive bounding rectangle defined by these points: minimum row `min_r = min(r1, r2)`, maximum row `max_r = max(r1, r2)`, minimum column `min_c = min(c1, c2)`, maximum column `max_c = max(c1, c2)`.
3.  **Apply Transformation within Bounding Box:** Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` within the calculated bounding box (`min_r <= r <= max_r`, `min_c <= c <= max_c`). Apply the following rules based on the pixel's color in the *input* grid:
    *   **If `input_grid[r, c]` is white (0):** Change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the trigger color `C`.
    *   **If `input_grid[r, c]` is azure (8):**
        *   Determine the pixel's relative position within its local 3x3 azure block. A pixel `(r, c)` is part of an azure block because its indices are not multiples of 4 (i.e., `r % 4 != 0` and `c % 4 != 0`).
        *   Calculate the relative row `rel_r = (r - 1) % 4` and relative column `rel_c = (c - 1) % 4`. These relative coordinates range from 0 to 2 within the 3x3 block.
        *   Change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the trigger color `C` *only if* the relative coordinates `(rel_r, rel_c)` are `(1, 0)` or `(1, 2)` (i.e., the pixel is in the middle row, and either the first or the third column of its 3x3 azure block).
    *   **If `input_grid[r, c]` is any other color (including the trigger color itself):** Leave the corresponding pixel in the output grid unchanged (it retains the value from the input grid).
4.  **Repeat for all Trigger Pairs:** Perform step 3 for every identified trigger pair and its associated bounding box. If bounding boxes from different trigger colors overlap, the transformations are applied independently based on the input grid's state within each box. The order of processing trigger colors does not affect the final result because changes depend only on the initial input grid state.
5.  **Final Output:** The resulting grid after applying transformations for all trigger pairs is the final output.
