## Assessment and Strategy

The initial hypothesis, implemented in `code_00.py`, assumed that all white pixels within the bounding box defined by a trigger pair should be changed to the trigger color. The execution results show this is incorrect. Specifically, white pixels that are *not* part of the main grid structure (i.e., the white lines separating the 3x3 azure blocks) are often left unchanged in the expected output, even when inside the bounding box.

The revised strategy is to focus on the interaction between the bounding box defined by the trigger pair and the inherent grid structure of the input. The core idea is that the transformation only affects the white pixels that constitute the "grid lines" separating the azure blocks.

**Revised Hypothesis:**
1.  Identify pairs of identically colored "trigger" pixels (colors other than white '0' and azure '8').
2.  For each pair, determine the inclusive bounding rectangle defined by their coordinates.
3.  Identify the major grid lines (rows and columns whose index `i` satisfies `i % 4 == 0`).
4.  Iterate through all pixels within the bounding rectangle.
5.  If a pixel lies on one of the identified major grid lines (either its row index `r` satisfies `r % 4 == 0` OR its column index `c` satisfies `c % 4 == 0`) AND its original color in the input grid is white (0), change its color in the output grid to the trigger color associated with the current bounding box.
6.  Pixels not meeting these criteria (azure pixels, non-grid-line white pixels, pixels outside the box) remain unchanged.
7.  Apply this process for all identified trigger pairs.

This revised hypothesis correctly explains why pixels like `Input[1,8]=0` in Example 2 (Magenta pair) remain `Expected[1,8]=0`, as row 1 and column 8 are not major grid lines (`1 % 4 != 0`, `8 % 4 == 0`, but the condition requires the pixel itself to be white *and* on a grid line; (1,8) is not on row 0/4/.. or col 0/4/.. *as a white pixel*, it's a white pixel separating azure blocks). The rule needs refinement: Change pixels *at* the intersection of the bounding box and the grid lines *if* they are white.

Let's refine again:
1. Find trigger pairs and their bounding boxes.
2. For each box and its color `C`:
3. Iterate `r` from `min_row` to `max_row`, `c` from `min_col` to `max_col`.
4. If `input[r, c] == 0` (is white) AND (`r % 4 == 0` OR `c % 4 == 0`) (is on a major grid line):
5. Set `output[r, c] = C`.
6. Otherwise, `output[r, c] = input[r, c]`.

This seems robust across the examples.

## Metrics

Let's confirm the grid structure and trigger locations programmatically.
