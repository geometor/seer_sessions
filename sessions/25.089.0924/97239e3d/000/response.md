Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently feature a repeating pattern: 3x3 blocks of azure (8) pixels separated by single lines of white (0) pixels. This creates a larger grid structure composed of these 4x4 meta-units (3x3 block + 1 line buffer).
2.  **Trigger Pixels:** Each input grid contains exactly two pixels of one or more specific colors (other than white '0' or azure '8'). In the examples, these are red (2), magenta (6), blue (1), orange (7), and green (3). These appear in pairs of the same color.
3.  **Transformation Areas:** The changes between input and output seem localized to rectangular regions. Observing the trigger pixel pairs, they appear to define the corners or boundaries of these transformation rectangles
