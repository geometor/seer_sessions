            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core components of the task: finding a frame object (red rectangle) and an inner shape object (different color), determining the output size from the frame, and attempting to scale the inner shape to fit within the frame's hollow interior. Example 2 was solved correctly, indicating the fundamental approach has merit.\n\nHowever, Examples 1 and 3 failed. The transformed output for Example 1 showed an incorrect pattern for the inner shape, and Example 3 showed a significantly misplaced and incomplete scaled pattern.\n\nThe strategy is to re-examine the properties of the frame and inner shape in each example, recalculate the scaling factor and expected placement, and compare this meticulously with the failed outputs. This analysis will help pinpoint whether the error lies in identifying the objects, extracting the inner shape's pattern, calculating the scale factor, determining the placement coordinates, or the pixel-filling logic during scaling. Specifically, the centering logic and the mapping from the original pattern pixel to the scaled block need careful review.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's gather precise metrics for each training example.\n\n"
