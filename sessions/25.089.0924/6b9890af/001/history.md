**Perception of Task Elements**

The task involves transforming a large input grid containing two distinct non-white objects into a smaller output grid. One object is always a hollow red (2) rectangle, which acts as a frame. The second object has a different color (blue (1), azure (8), yellow (4) in the examples) and a specific shape. The output grid's size is determined by the dimensions of the red frame object. The core transformation involves taking the shape of the second object, scaling it up, and placing the scaled version inside the hollow space of the red frame in the output grid. The scaling factor is determined by how many times the second object's dimensions fit into the inner dimensions of the red frame. The final output grid consists of the red frame surrounding the scaled, colored inner object, with any remaining space inside the frame being white (0).

**YAML Fact Sheet**


```yaml
Task: Frame and Scale Shape

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
  - Background: Predominantly white (0).
  - Objects:
    - Exactly two non-white objects present.
    - Object_1:
      - Type: Frame
      - Color: Red (2)
      - Shape: Hollow Rectangle (always has a border of 1 pixel thickness)
      - Properties: Bounding box defines output size. Has an inner hollow area.
    - Object_2:
      - Type: Inner Shape
      - Color: Varies (Blue (1), Azure (8), Yellow (4)) - distinct from Red and White.
      - Shape: Varies (L-shape, Plus-shape, T-shape variant).
      - Properties: Defined by its contiguous colored pixels and bounding box.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Smaller 2D array.
  - Dimensions: Matches the bounding box dimensions of the input Red Frame object.
  - Content:
    - Outer Frame: Pixels corresponding to the input Red Frame object retain their Red (2) color.
    - Inner Content:
      - Derived from scaling the input Inner Shape object.
      - Scaling_Factor: Integer factor calculated by dividing the inner dimension (height/width) of the Red Frame by the corresponding dimension (height/width) of the Inner Shape's bounding box (using floor division). Assumed scale is the same for height and width.
      - Placement: The scaled Inner Shape is drawn centered within the hollow area of the Red Frame. Each pixel of the original Inner Shape is replaced by a `scale x scale` block of its color in the output.
      - Background_Fill: Any area within the Red Frame not covered by the scaled Inner Shape is White (0).

Relationships:
  - Output size depends directly on the Red Frame's size.
  - Output inner content depends on the Inner Shape's form and color.
  - Scaling factor links the relative sizes of the Inner Shape and the Red Frame's hollow interior.
  - Placement of the scaled shape depends on centering it within the frame's interior.

Assumptions:
  - Input always contains exactly one hollow red rectangle and one other non-white object.
  - The red rectangle is always hollow with a 1-pixel border.
  - The inner dimensions of the frame are always greater than or equal to the dimensions of the second object's bounding box.
  - A single integer scaling factor applies to both height and width.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid to find the two distinct non-white objects.
    *   Identify the hollow red (2) rectangle object (the "Frame"). Determine its bounding box coordinates (top-left `r1_min, c1_min`, bottom-right `r1_max, c1_max`).
    *   Identify the other non-white, non-red object (the "Inner Shape"). Determine its color (`C`) and its bounding box coordinates (top-left `r2_min, c2_min`, bottom-right `r2_max, c2_max`).
2.  **Determine Output Size:** Calculate the height
