Task: Frame and Scale Shape

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
  - Background: Predominantly white (0).
  - Objects:
    - Exactly two non-white objects present.
    - Object_1:
      - Type: Frame
      - Color: Red (2)
      - Shape: Hollow Rectangle (always has a border of 1 pixel thickness)
      - Properties: Bounding box defines output size. Has an inner hollow area.
    - Object_2:
      - Type: Inner Shape
      - Color: Varies (Blue (1), Azure (8), Yellow (4)) - distinct from Red and White.
      - Shape: Varies (L-shape, Plus-shape, T-shape variant).
      - Properties: Defined by its contiguous colored pixels and bounding box.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Smaller 2D array.
  - Dimensions: Matches the bounding box dimensions of the input Red Frame object.
  - Content:
    - Outer Frame: Pixels corresponding to the input Red Frame object retain their Red (2) color.
    - Inner Content:
      - Derived from scaling the input Inner Shape object.
      - Scaling_Factor: Integer factor calculated by dividing the inner dimension (height/width) of the Red Frame by the corresponding dimension (height/width) of the Inner Shape's bounding box (using floor division). Assumed scale is the same for height and width.
      - Placement: The scaled Inner Shape is drawn centered within the hollow area of the Red Frame. Each pixel of the original Inner Shape is replaced by a `scale x scale` block of its color in the output.
      - Background_Fill: Any area within the Red Frame not covered by the scaled Inner Shape is White (0).

Relationships:
  - Output size depends directly on the Red Frame's size.
  - Output inner content depends on the Inner Shape's form and color.
  - Scaling factor links the relative sizes of the Inner Shape and the Red Frame's hollow interior.
  - Placement of the scaled shape depends on centering it within the frame's interior.

Assumptions:
  - Input always contains exactly one hollow red rectangle and one other non-white object.
  - The red rectangle is always hollow with a 1-pixel border.
  - The inner dimensions of the frame are always greater than or equal to the dimensions of the second object's bounding box.
  - A single integer scaling factor applies to both height and width.
