task_description: "Move specific colored pixels (orange and green) to positions adjacent to other specific colored pixels (blue and red), based on proximity."
elements:
  - type: pixel
    color: blue (1)
    role: attractor
    behavior: remains static
  - type: pixel
    color: red (2)
    role: attractor
    behavior: remains static
  - type: pixel
    color: orange (7)
    role: mover
    behavior: moves towards the nearest blue pixel, occupying the closest available adjacent (N,S,E,W) white cell. Original pixel location becomes white.
  - type: pixel
    color: green (3)
    role: mover
    behavior: moves towards the nearest red pixel, occupying the closest available adjacent (N,S,E,W) white cell. Original pixel location becomes white.
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: background/empty
relationships:
  - type: proximity_attraction
    source: orange (7) pixels
    target: blue (1) pixels
    details: Each orange pixel is assigned to the closest available adjacent (N,S,E,W) white cell around the nearest blue pixel. Orange pixels are processed in order of their distance to the blue pixel.
  - type: proximity_attraction
    source: green (3) pixels
    target: red (2) pixels
    details: Each green pixel is assigned to the closest available adjacent (N,S,E,W) white cell around the nearest red pixel. Green pixels are processed in order of their distance to the red pixel.
constraints:
  - Only the four cardinal adjacent cells (North, South, East, West) are considered for placement.
  - A cell can only be occupied by one pixel. If an adjacent cell is already occupied (e.g., by the attractor pixel itself or another moved pixel), it cannot be filled.
  - The movement assignment prioritizes the closest 'mover' pixel (orange/green) to the 'attractor' pixel (blue/red).
  - The placement location prioritizes the adjacent cell closest (Manhattan distance) to the original position of the 'mover' pixel.
  - The maximum number of pixels that can surround an attractor is 4.
