            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task involves transforming an input grid containing pixels of various colors (white, blue, red, green, orange) into an output grid.\n2.  **Key Colors:** Blue (1) and Red (2) pixels seem to act as static 'attractors'. Orange (7) and Green (3) pixels seem to be 'movers'. White (0) is the background.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:**\n    *   Orange pixels in the input seem to relate to the blue pixels. In the output, orange pixels appear in the immediate N, S, E, W adjacent cells to the blue pixels.\n    *   Green pixels in the input seem to relate to the red pixels. In the output, green pixels appear in the immediate N, S, E, W adjacent cells to the red pixels.\n    *   The number of orange pixels appearing around a blue pixel corresponds to the number of orange pixels present in the input grid (up to a maximum of 4, one for each adjacent spot). The specific orange pixels that appear seem to be determined by proximity: the closest orange pixels in the input 'move' to the closest available adjacent spots around the blue pixel.\n    *   Similarly, the number and placement of green pixels around a red pixel are determined by the proximity of the green pixels in the input grid to the red pixel and the availability of adjacent spots.\n    *   The original orange and green pixels from the input grid disappear from their initial locations and reappear adjacent to their corresponding attractor (blue or red).\n    *   Blue and red pixels remain in their original positions.\n    *   All other pixels become white (background).\n\n**YAML Facts Block:**\n\n"
