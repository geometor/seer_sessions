The movement is based on proximity.\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (white=0).\n2.  **Static Placement:** Identify all blue (1) and red (2) pixels in the input. Place them in the output grid at their original locations.\n3.  **Mover Assignment:**\n    *   For each orange (7) pixel in the input, find the *closest* blue (1) pixel using Manhattan distance. If there are multiple blue pixels at the same minimum distance, choose the one with the smallest row index, then the smallest column index. Assign the orange pixel to this chosen blue pixel.\n    *   Perform the same assignment process for green (3) pixels, assigning each to its closest red (2) pixel using the same distance calculation and tie-breaking rules.\n4.  **Mover Placement:**\n    *   For each blue (1) pixel:\n        *   Consider all orange (7) pixels assigned to it.\n        *   Sort these assigned orange pixels based on their Manhattan distance *to this blue pixel* (ascending). Use the orange pixel's original row, then column index for tie-breaking.\n        *   Identify the four adjacent cells (N, S, E, W) to the blue pixel.\n        *   Iterate through the sorted assigned orange pixels. For each orange pixel:\n            *   Find the adjacent cells around the blue pixel that are currently white (0) in the output grid and within the grid bounds.\n            *   If there are no such available adjacent cells, skip this orange pixel.\n            *   Calculate the Manhattan distance from the *original position* of the current orange pixel to each *available* adjacent cell.\n            *   Choose the available adjacent cell with the minimum distance to the orange pixel. Use the adjacent cell's row, then column index for tie-breaking.\n            *   Place an orange (7) pixel in the chosen adjacent cell in the output grid. Mark this cell as occupied for this blue pixel (so it cannot be used again by other oranges assigned to the same blue).\n    *   Repeat the placement process for each red (2) pixel and its assigned green (3) pixels, following the same sorting and proximity rules.\n5.  **Final Output:** The resulting grid with static attractors and moved pixels is the final output.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_pixels(grid: np.ndarray, color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"Finds all coordinates of pixels with a specific color.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = np.where(grid == color)\n    return list(zip(rows, cols))\n\ndef manhattan_distance(p1: Tuple[int, int], p2: Tuple[int, int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Calculates Manhattan distance between two points (row, col).\"\"\"\n    r1, c1 = p1\n    r2, c2 = p2\n    return abs(r1 - r2) + abs(c1 - c2)\n\ndef get_valid_adjacent_cells(grid_shape: Tuple[int, int], point: Tuple[int, int]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"Gets valid (within bounds) N, S, E, W adjacent cells.\"\"\"\n    r, c = point\n    h, w = grid_shape\n    potential_neighbors = [\n        (r - 1, c), #
