Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task involves transforming an input grid containing pixels of various colors (white, blue, red, green, orange) into an output grid.
2.  **Key Colors:** Blue (1) and Red (2) pixels seem to act as static 'attractors'. Orange (7) and Green (3) pixels seem to be 'movers'. White (0) is the background.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:**
    *   Orange pixels in the input seem to relate to the blue pixels. In the output, orange pixels appear in the immediate N, S, E, W adjacent cells to the blue pixels.
    *   Green pixels in the input seem to relate to the red pixels. In the output, green pixels appear in the immediate N, S, E, W adjacent cells to the red pixels.
    *   The number of orange pixels appearing around a blue pixel corresponds to the number of orange pixels present in the input grid (up to a maximum of 4, one for each adjacent spot). The specific orange pixels that appear seem to be determined by proximity: the closest orange pixels in the input 'move' to the closest available adjacent spots around the blue pixel.
    *   Similarly, the number and placement of green pixels around a red pixel are determined by the proximity of the green pixels in the input grid to the red pixel and the availability of adjacent spots.
    *   The original orange and green pixels from the input grid disappear from their initial locations and reappear adjacent to their corresponding attractor (blue or red).
    *   Blue and red pixels remain in their original positions.
    *   All other pixels become white (background).

**YAML Facts Block:**


```yaml
task_description: "Move specific colored pixels (orange and green) to positions adjacent to other specific colored pixels (blue and red), based on proximity."
elements:
  - type: pixel
    color: blue (1)
    role: attractor
    behavior: remains static
  - type: pixel
    color: red (2)
    role: attractor
    behavior: remains static
  - type: pixel
    color: orange (7)
    role: mover
    behavior: moves towards the nearest blue pixel, occupying the closest available adjacent (N,S,E,W) white cell. Original pixel location becomes white.
  - type: pixel
    color: green (3)
    role: mover
    behavior: moves towards the nearest red pixel, occupying the closest available adjacent (N,S,E,W) white cell. Original pixel location becomes white.
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: background/empty
relationships:
  - type: proximity_attraction
    source: orange (7) pixels
    target: blue (1) pixels
    details: Each orange pixel is assigned to the closest available adjacent (N,S,E,W) white cell around the nearest blue pixel. Orange pixels are processed in order of their distance to the blue pixel.
  - type: proximity_attraction
    source: green (3) pixels
    target: red (2) pixels
    details: Each green pixel is assigned to the closest available adjacent (N,S,E,W) white cell around the nearest red pixel. Green pixels are processed in order of their distance to the red pixel.
constraints:
  - Only the four cardinal adjacent cells (North, South, East, West) are considered for placement.
  - A cell can only be occupied by one pixel. If an adjacent cell is already occupied (e.g., by the attractor pixel itself or another moved pixel), it cannot be filled.
  - The movement assignment prioritizes the closest 'mover' pixel (orange/green) to the 'attractor' pixel (blue/red).
  - The placement location prioritizes the adjacent cell closest (Manhattan distance) to the original position of the 'mover' pixel.
  - The maximum number of pixels that can surround an attractor is 4.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a blank grid (all white pixels) of the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Identify the locations of all blue (1) and red (2) pixels from the input grid. Place these blue and red pixels onto the output grid at their original locations.
3.  Identify the locations of all orange (7) pixels (`OrangeSources`) and blue (1) pixels (`BlueTargets`) in the *input* grid.
4.  For each `BlueTarget`:
    a.  Calculate the Manhattan distance from each `OrangeSource` to the `BlueTarget`.
    b.  Sort the `OrangeSources` based on their distance to the `BlueTarget` (ascending order, use row then column index for tie-breaking).
    c.  Identify the four potential adjacent destination cells (North, South, East, West) around the `BlueTarget`.
    d.  Iterate through the sorted `OrangeSources`. For each `OrangeSource`:
        i.  Find the available adjacent destination cell (must be white (0) in the current output grid) that has the minimum Manhattan distance *from the current `OrangeSource`*. Use row then column index for tie-breaking among destination cells with equal minimum distance.
        ii. If such an available destination cell exists, place an orange (7) pixel in that cell in the output grid and mark this destination cell as occupied for the current `BlueTarget`.
5.  Identify the locations of all green (3) pixels (`GreenSources`) and red (2) pixels (`RedTargets`) in the *input* grid.
6.  For each `RedTarget`:
    a.  Calculate the Manhattan distance from each `GreenSource` to the `RedTarget`.
    b.  Sort the `GreenSources` based on their distance to the `RedTarget` (ascending order, use row then column index for tie-breaking).
    c.  Identify the four potential adjacent destination cells (North, South, East, West) around the `RedTarget`.
    d.  Iterate through the sorted `GreenSources`. For each `GreenSource`:
        i.  Find the available adjacent destination cell (must be white (0) in the current output grid) that has the minimum Manhattan distance *from the current `GreenSource`*. Use row then column index for tie-breaking among destination cells with equal minimum distance.
        ii. If such an available destination cell exists, place a green (3) pixel in that cell in the output grid and mark this destination cell as occupied for the current `RedTarget`.
7.  The resulting grid is the final output.
