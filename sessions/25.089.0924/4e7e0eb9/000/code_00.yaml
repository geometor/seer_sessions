task_elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - Contains 3x3 blocks of non-white color.
      - Contains white background pixels (0).
      - Contains single-pixel-width separator rows/columns.
  - element: 3x3 Block
    properties:
      - Uniform, non-white color.
      - Always size 3x3.
    grouping:
      - Arranged in groups of four (2x2 pattern).
      - Let the blocks in a group be A(TL), B(TR), C(BL), D(BR).
  - element: Separator
    properties:
      - Single pixel width (row or column).
      - Located between the four blocks in a group.
      - Can be white (0) or non-white (colored).
    relationships:
      - Vertical Separator: Between A/C and B/D.
      - Horizontal Separator: Between A/B and C/D.
transformation_logic:
  - condition: Vertical separator is non-white, Horizontal separator is white.
    action: Swap colors horizontally.
    details: Block A gets color of B, B gets color of A. Block C gets color of D, D gets color of C.
  - condition: Horizontal separator is non-white, Vertical separator is white.
    action: Swap colors vertically.
    details: Block A gets color of C, C gets color of A. Block B gets color of D, D gets color of B.
  - condition: Both Vertical and Horizontal separators are white.
    action: Propagate unique color.
    details: Find the counts of each color among blocks A, B, C, D. If one color is unique (count=1), change all four blocks (A, B, C, D) to that unique color.
unchanged_elements:
  - Background pixels (white).
  - Separator pixels (both white and non-white).
