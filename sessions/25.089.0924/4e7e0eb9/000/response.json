These separators can be white (0) or a non-white color (e.g., Yellow(4), Gray(5), Orange(7)).\n4.  **Arrangement:** The 3x3 blocks are consistently arranged in groups of four, forming a larger 2x2 pattern (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). Let's label these A, B, C, D respectively.\n5.  **Interaction:** The transformation rule depends entirely on the nature of the separators (vertical and horizontal) between the four blocks in a group.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all groups of four 3x3 non-white blocks arranged in a 2x2 super-structure (Top-Left A, Top-Right B, Bottom-Left C, Bottom-Right D) within the input grid. These groups are separated by a single column (between A/C and B/D) and a single row (between A/B and C/D).\n2.  For each identified group of four blocks:\n    a.  Determine the color of the vertical separator column and the horizontal separator row.\n    b.  **If the vertical separator is a non-white color AND the horizontal separator is white (0):** The transformation rule is a horizontal color swap. In the output grid, block A takes the original color of block B, block B takes the original color of block A, block C takes the original color of block D, and block D takes the original color of block C.\n    c.  **If the horizontal separator is a non-white color AND the vertical separator is white (0):** The transformation rule is a vertical color swap. In the output grid, block A takes the original color of block C, block C takes the original color of block A, block B takes the original color of block D, and block D takes the original color of block B.\n    d.  **If both the vertical and horizontal separators are white (0):** The transformation rule is unique color propagation. Count the occurrences of each distinct color present in the four blocks (A, B, C, D). Identify the color that appears exactly once. In the output grid, change the color of all four blocks (A, B, C, D) to this unique color.\n3.  Copy all other pixels (background white pixels and the separator pixels themselves) from the input grid to the output grid without modification.\n4.  The final output grid contains the modified block colors and the unchanged background/separator pixels."
