Start with a copy of the input grid.\n2. Determine the locations of all horizontal and vertical lines based on the centers of the largest objects.\n3. For each pixel (r, c):\n    a. If it lies at the intersection of a horizontal line (from object A) and a vertical line (from object B):\n        i. If (r, c) is the calculated center of ANY largest object, set the pixel to that object's color.\n        ii. Otherwise (intersection of lines from different objects, not at a center), set the pixel to 0 (white).\n    b. If it lies only on a horizontal line (from object A) and the original input pixel input[r, c] was 0 (white), set the pixel to the color of object A. Otherwise, keep the original input color.\n    c. If it lies only on a vertical line (from object B) and the original input pixel input[r, c] was 0 (white), set the pixel to the color of object B. Otherwise, keep the original input color.\n    d. If the pixel does not lie on any line, keep the original input color.\nNote: If multiple largest objects define the same horizontal or vertical line, the color associated with the line is determined by the object processed last in the iteration.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of non-background colors in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an \n              object and contains 'color', 'pixels' (list of coordinates), \n              'size', and 'bbox' (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n    \n    #
