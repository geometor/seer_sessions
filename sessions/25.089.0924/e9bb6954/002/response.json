The errors in the output `Transformed Output` compared to `Expected Output` are:\n    *   `T[5,4]` is 2, `E[5,4]` is 0. Input `I[5,4]` is 0.\n    *   `T[5,7]` is 6, `E[5,7]` is 0. Input `I[5,7]` is 0. (Wait, input `I[5,7]` is `6`. The expected output `E[5,7]` is `0`. This contradicts the rule \"only fill white cells\". The transformed `T[5,7]` is `6`, preserving the input. This suggests the rule might be wrong, or there's another factor. Let's re-examine the description: \"Lines only color cells that were originally white (0) in the input grid; they do not overwrite existing non-white pixels.\" The *expected output* seems to violate this rule at (5,7). Let's check the other errors.)\n    *   `T[8,11]` is 2, `E[8,11]` is 0. Input `I[8,11]` is 0.\n    *   `T[10,11]` is 8, `E[10,11]` is 0. Input `I[10,11]` is 8. Expected `E[10,11]` is `0`. This is another violation of the non-overwrite rule in the *expected* output.\n    *   `T[11,4]` is 3, `E[11,4]` is 0. Input `I[11,4]` is 0.\n    *   `T[17,4]` is 3, `E[17,4]` is 0. Input `I[17,4]` is 0.\n    *   Okay, the results show the code *is* respecting the non-overwrite rule (it preserves `I[5,7]=6` and `I[10,11]=8`), but the *expected* output overwrites these with `0`. This suggests my initial interpretation or the non-overwrite constraint might be slightly off, or perhaps the *order* of drawing lines matters, or maybe the comparison tool is flawed (less likely).\n    *   Let's look at the expected output again. Row 5: `0 0 2 6 3 0 3 0 0 0 2 2 2 0` -> Expected `2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2`. The code produced `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 6 2 2 2 2 2 2`. The expected output has `0` where the code (correctly, based on input) has `5`, `6`, `7`. It seems the horizontal line should *only* be drawn *within the bounds* of the grid, and perhaps it should overwrite existing pixels *except* those belonging to *other* largest objects? No, that doesn't fit.\n    *   Hypothesis: Maybe the \"do not overwrite\" applies *only* to the pixels of the *input* grid, not pixels drawn by *previous* lines in the same transformation step? Let's re-run the logic:\n        1. Copy input to output.\n        2. Process Red object (color 2, center 5, 11):\n           * Draw H line row 5: `output[5, c] = 2 if output[5, c] == 0`. Overwrites 0s. Preserves 6 at (5,7).\n           * Draw V line col 11: `output[r, 11] = 2 if output[r, 11] == 0`. Overwrites 0s. Preserves 8 at (1,10) (typo in input, should be (1,10) is 8?). No, `I[1,10]=8`. `I[10,11]=8`. Preserves 8 at (10,11).\n        3. Process Green object (color 3, center 8, 4):\n           * Draw H line row 8: `output[r, 4] = 3 if output[r, 4] == 0`. Overwrites 0s. Preserves 3s at (7,3),(8,3),(9,3). Preserves 8 at (16,3)? No, `I[16,3]=8`. Preserves 8.\n           * Draw V line col 4: `output[r, 4] = 3 if output[r, 4] == 0`. Overwrites 0s. Preserves 3 at (7,4),(8,4),(9,4). Preserves 3 at (14,4).\n    *   The code seems to follow the non-overwrite-initial-pixels logic correctly. Let's re-examine the expected output for Example 1 carefully.\n    *   Expected `E[5,:] = [2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2]`. Code `T[5,:] = [2 2 2 2 2 2 2 6 2 2 2 2 2 2]`. `E[5,4]` is `0`. `T[5,4]` is `2`. Input `I[5,4]` is `0`. Red H-line writes `2`. Green V-line (col 4) writes `3`. Ah! If the green V-line is drawn *after* the red H-line, and it *only* writes on `0`s, then `T[5,4]` should remain `2`. If the red H-line is drawn *after* the green V-line, `T[5,4]` would be `3`, then overwritten by red `2`? No, non-overwrite rule. So `T[5,4]` should be `3`. This doesn't match expected `0`.\n    *   What if the lines *only* overwrite the background `0` *from the original input*?\n        *   Let `output = input.copy()`.\n        *   For each largest object (color, center_r, center_c):\n            *   Draw H line: `output[center_r, c] = color if input[center_r, c] == 0`\n            *   Draw V line: `output[r, center_c] = color if input[r, center_c] == 0`\n    *   Let's try this \"only overwrite original zeros\" logic for Example 1:\n        *   Red object (2, center 5, 11):\n            *   H line row 5: `output[5, c] = 2 if input[5, c] == 0`. `input[5,7]` is 6, so `output[5,7]` remains 6. `input[5,4]` is 0, so `output[5,4]` becomes 2.\n            *   V line col 11: `output[r, 11] = 2 if input[r, 11] == 0`. `input[10,11]` is 8, so `output[10,11]` remains 8.\n        *   Green object (3, center 8, 4):\n            *   H line row 8: `output[8, c] = 3 if input[8, c] == 0`. `input[8,3:6]` are 3, `output` remains 3. `input[8,11]` is 0, `output[8,11]` becomes 3. (Code had 2 here from red V-line).\n            *   V line col 4: `output[r, 4] = 3 if input[r, 4] == 0`. `input[7:10, 4]` are 3, `output` remains 3. `input[14,4]` is 3, `output` remains 3. `input[4,4]` is 5, `output` remains 5. `input[5,4]` is 0, `output[5,4]` becomes 3. (Code had 2 here from red H-line).\n    *   This \"only overwrite original zeros\" seems more promising. Let's re-run the code logic with this modification.\n\n*   **Example 2:** Mismatch at `T[6,12]` (is 9, expected 4) and `T[13,6]` (is 8, expected 4).\n    *   Largest object: Yellow (4), size 9, center (6, 6).\n    *   H line row 6: `output[6, c] = 4 if input[6, c] == 0`. `input[6,12]` is 9. Stays 9. Expected is 4.\n    *   V line col 6: `output[r, 6] = 4 if input[r, 6] == 0`. `input[13,6]` is 8. Stays 8. Expected is 4.\n    *   The expected output *overwrites* existing non-zero pixels (9 and 8) with the line color (4). This contradicts the \"only white\" rule again. It seems the lines *do* overwrite existing pixels.\n    *   Let's retry the original code logic where lines overwrite everything *except* the original non-zero pixels from the *input grid*. No, that's what the previous code did and it failed.\n    *   What if the rule is simpler: Draw the lines, overwriting *everything* in their path?\n        *   Let `output = input.copy()`.\n        *   For each largest object (color, center_r, center_c):\n            *   Draw H line: `output[center_r, :] = color`\n            *   Draw V line: `output[:, center_c] = color`\n        *   This seems too simple and destructive. Let's check Example 1 again with this. It would wipe out many original pixels. No.\n    *   Maybe the rule is: Draw lines, only overwriting 0s. If multiple lines cross, the one from the object processed *last* wins? Or maybe based on color index? Or object position (top-left first)? Let's assume order matters based on iteration order of `largest_objects`. The code calculated them; let's see the order (though it might not be stable).\n        *   Ex 1: Red (2) then Green (3).\n            *   Red lines drawn first (only on 0s).\n            *   Green lines drawn second (only on 0s *that remain*). `output[5,4]` becomes 2 (from red H), stays 2. `output[8,11]` becomes 2 (from red V), stays 2. Expected needs `0` at these spots.\n        *   Ex 3: Azure (8), then Magenta (6), then Green (3).\n            *   Azure lines (row 3, col 12).\n            *   Magenta lines (row 10, col 4).\n            *   Green lines (row 15, col 16).\n            *   This doesn't explain the large number of errors in Ex 3.\n    *   Let's reconsider the \"center\". Bounding box center `floor((min+max)/2)` is standard. Is it possible it's different? Like centroid? Unlikely for ARC.\n    *   What if the \"non-overwrite\" rule *only* applies to the intersection pixel? No, that doesn't fit.\n    *   Could the object identification be wrong? Using 8-way adjacency is standard. Let's assume it's correct.\n    *   Could the largest size calculation be wrong? Seems straightforward.\n\n    *   **Backtrack:** The simplest explanation for Examples 2, 3, 4 having lines that overwrite existing non-zero pixels in the *expected* output is that the lines *do* overwrite. The simplest explanation for Example 1 *not* overwriting some pixels (like `E[5,7]=0` where `I[5,7]=6` and red line passes) is more complex.\n    *   Is it possible the rule is: Draw the lines for *all* largest objects. The final color of a pixel `(r, c)` is:\n        *   Its original color `input[r, c]` if `input[r, c]` is not 0.\n        *   The color of the vertical line passing through it, if any, AND `input[r, c]` was 0.\n        *   The color of the horizontal line passing through it, if any, AND `input[r, c]` was 0.\n        *   If both horizontal and vertical lines pass through `(r,c)` and `input[r,c]` was 0, what happens?\n            *   Ex 1: Intersection (5, 11) - red center. `input[5,11]=0`. Expected `E[5,11]=2` (red).\n            *   Ex 1: Intersection (8, 4) - green center. `input[8,4]=3`. Expected `E[8,4]=3`. (Preserved).\n            *   Ex 1: Intersection (5, 4). Red H-line (row 5), Green V-line (col 4). `input[5,4]=0`. Expected `E[5,4]=0`. Why 0? Neither red nor green? This is the key confusion point.\n            *   Ex 1: Intersection (8, 11). Green H-line (row 8), Red V-line (col 11). `input[8,11]=0`. Expected `E[8,11]=0`. Why 0?\n            *   Ex 3: Intersection (3, 12) - azure center. `input[3,12]=8`. Expected `E[3,12]=8`. Preserved.\n            *   Ex 3: Intersection (10, 4) - magenta center. `input[10,4]=6`. Expected `E[10,4]=6`. Preserved.\n            *   Ex 3: Intersection (15, 16) - green center. `input[15,16]=3`. Expected `E[15,16]=3`. Preserved.\n            *   Ex 3: Intersection (3, 4). Azure H-line (row 3), Magenta V-line (col 4). `input[3,4]=0`. Expected `E[3,4]=0`. Why 0?\n            *   Ex 3: Intersection (10, 12). Magenta H-line (row 10), Azure V-line (col 12). `input[10,12]=0`. Expected `E[10,12]=0`. Why 0?\n            *   Ex 3: Intersection (15, 4). Green H-line (row 15), Magenta V-line (col 4). `input[15,4]=0`. Expected `E[15,4]=0`. Why 0?\n            *   Ex 3: Intersection (3, 16). Azure H-line (row 3), Green V-line (col 16). `input[3,16]=3`. Expected `E[3,16]=0`. Input overwritten? This contradicts center preservation. Let's recheck `E[3,16]`. It is `0`.\n            *   Ex 3: Intersection (10, 16). Magenta H-line (row 10), Green V-line (col 16). `input[10,16]=0`. Expected `E[10,16]=0`.\n            *   Ex 3: Intersection (15, 12). Green H-line (row 15), Azure V-line (col 12). `input[15,12]=0`. Expected `E[15,12]=0`.\n\n    *   **New Hypothesis:** The lines are drawn, but *only* pixels that were originally background (0) are modified. However, if a background pixel `(r, c)` lies on the intersection of a horizontal line (color H) from object 1 and a vertical line (color V) from object 2, this pixel remains background (0). If it lies only on a horizontal line (color H), it becomes H. If it lies only on a vertical line (color V), it becomes V. If it lies on its *own* object's center intersection, it takes that object's color.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis on Ex 1 intersections:\n*   (5, 11): Red center. Input 0. Expected 2. Fits (own center).\n*   (8, 4): Green center. Input 3. Expected 3. Fits (non-zero input preserved).\n*   (5, 4): Red H, Green V. Input 0. Expected 0. Fits (intersection rule).\n*   (8, 11): Green H, Red V. Input 0. Expected 0. Fits (intersection rule).\n\nLet's test on Ex 3 intersections:\n*   (3, 12): Azure center. Input 8. Expected 8. Fits (non-zero input preserved).\n*   (10, 4): Magenta center. Input 6. Expected 6. Fits (non-zero input preserved).\n*   (15, 16): Green center. Input 3. Expected 3. Fits (non-zero input preserved).\n*   (3, 4): Azure H, Magenta V. Input 0. Expected 0. Fits (intersection rule).\n*   (10, 12): Magenta H, Azure V. Input 0. Expected 0. Fits (intersection rule).\n*   (15, 4): Green H, Magenta V. Input 0. Expected 0. Fits (intersection rule).\n*   (3, 16): Azure H, Green V. Input 3. Expected 0. **Fails!** Input is non-zero, but expected is 0. Why?\n*   (10, 16): Magenta H, Green V. Input 0. Expected 0. Fits (intersection rule).\n*   (15, 12): Green H, Azure V. Input 0. Expected 0. Fits (intersection rule).\n\nThe failure at (3, 16) in Ex 3 breaks the hypothesis. Input is 3, Azure H line (row 3) and Green V line (col 16) intersect. Expected is 0.\n\nMaybe the rule is simpler: Draw all lines for all largest objects onto a temporary layer initially all zero. Then merge this layer with the input: if `input[r,c] != 0`, use `input[r,c]`, else use `temp_layer[r,c]`.\n\nLet's try *this* hypothesis:\n1.  Find largest objects.\n2.  Create `output = input.copy()`.\n3.  Create `line_layer = np.zeros_like(input)`.\n4.  For each largest object (color, center_r, center_c):\n    a.  Draw H line on `line_layer`: `line_layer[center_r, :] = color`.\n    b.  Draw V line on `line_layer`: `line_layer[:, center_c] = color`.\n5.  Combine: `output[r, c] = line_layer[r, c] if input[r, c] == 0 else input[r, c]`.\n\nTest on Ex 1:\n*   Largest: Red (2, center 5, 11), Green (3, center 8, 4).\n*   `line_layer` initially all 0s.\n*   Red lines: `line_layer[5, :] = 2`, `line_layer[:, 11] = 2`.\n*   Green lines: `line_layer[8, :] = 3`, `line_layer[:, 4] = 3`.\n*   At intersections: `line_layer[5, 11]` becomes 2 (red H), then 2 (red V) -> 2. `line_layer[8, 4]` becomes 3 (green H), then 3 (green V) -> 3. `line_layer[5, 4]` becomes 2 (red H), then 3 (green V) -> 3. `line_layer[8, 11]` becomes 3 (green H), then 2 (red V) -> 2.\n*   Combine:\n    *   `(5, 4)`: `input=0`, `line=3`. Output = 3. Expected = 0. **Fails.**\n    *   `(8, 11)`: `input=0`, `line=2`. Output = 2. Expected = 0. **Fails.**\n    *   `(5, 7)`: `input=6`, `line=2`. Output = 6. Expected = 0. **Fails.**\n    *   `(10, 11)`: `input=8`, `line=2`. Output = 8. Expected = 0. **Fails.**\n    *   `(3, 16)` in Ex 3: `input=3`, `line=` (Azure V=8, Green H=3 -> 3). Output = 3. Expected = 0. **Fails.**\n\nMy understanding of the interaction between lines and existing pixels is flawed. The points where the expected output is 0, but the input was non-zero or a line was drawn, are confusing.\n\nLet's look *only* at the cells that change from non-zero in input to zero in output in the expected results:\n*   Ex 1: `I[5,7]=6 -> E[5,7]=0`. `I[10,11]=8 -> E[10,11]=0`.\n*   Ex 3: `I[3,16]=3 -> E[3,16]=0`. `I[10,15]=3 -> E[10,15]=0`. `I[12,14]=3 -> E[12,14]=0`. `I[15,5]=2 -> E[15,5]=0`. `I[16,14]=8 -> E[16,14]=0`.\n*   Ex 4: `I[5,13]=0 -> E[5,13]=0`. `I[11,7]=0 -> E[11,7]=0`. (These were 0, line color expected, but got 0). Wait, `I[5,13]=0`. Orange H line (row 11), Azure V line (col 7). Expected `E[5,13]=0`. Fits intersection=0 rule. `I[11,7]=0`. Orange H line (row 11), Azure V line (col 7). Expected `E[11,7]=0`. Fits intersection=0 rule.\n    *   But check `I[5,13]`. Input row 5 is `[0 0 0 8 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. `I[5,13]=0`. Why did I think it was non-zero?\n    *   Let's re-check the pixels-off for Ex 4. `T[5,13]=8`, `E[5,13]=0`. `T[11,1]=5`, `E[11,1]=7`. `T[11,7]=8`, `E[11,7]=0`. `T[11,9]=3`, `E[11,9]=7`.\n    *   Okay, the common theme seems to be intersections of lines from *different* largest objects result in 0, *even if the input pixel was non-zero*.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:**\n1.  Identify all distinct objects and find the maximum size.\n2.  Select all objects with the maximum size.\n3.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n4.  Create a set of coordinates for horizontal lines and a set for vertical lines to be drawn. Store the associated color. If multiple objects want to draw the same line, the color doesn't matter yet.\n    *   `h_lines = {} # key=row, value=color`\n    *   `v_lines = {} # key=col, value=color`\n    *   For each largest object (color, bbox):\n        *   center_r = (bbox[0] + bbox[1]) // 2\n        *   center_c = (bbox[2] + bbox[3]) // 2\n        *   `h_lines[center_r] = color` # Overwrite if multiple objects use same row\n        *   `v_lines[center_c] = color` # Overwrite if multiple objects use same col\n        *   (Does overwrite order matter? Let's assume not for now).\n5.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the grid:\n    a.  Is there a horizontal line requested for row `r` (`r in h_lines`)? Let color be `h_color = h_lines[r]`.\n    b.  Is there a vertical line requested for column `c` (`c in v_lines`)? Let color be `v_color = v_lines[c]`.\n    c.  If *both* horizontal and vertical lines are requested (`r in h_lines` and `c in v_lines`):\n        i.  Get the center coordinates `(center_r_h, center_c_h)` for the object that requested the H line at row `r`.\n        ii. Get the center coordinates `(center_r_v, center_c_v)` for the object that requested the V line at col `c`.\n        iii. If `(r, c)` is the center of *either* of these objects (i.e., `(r,c) == (center_r_h, center_c_h)` OR `(r,c) == (center_r_v, center_c_v)`), set `output[r, c] = h_lines[r]` (or `v_lines[c]`, they should be the same color if it's the center).\n        iv. Else (intersection point of lines from *different* objects), set `output[r, c] = 0`.\n    d.  Else if *only* a horizontal line is requested (`r in h_lines`):\n        i.  Set `output[r, c] = h_lines[r]`.\n    e.  Else if *only* a vertical line is requested (`c in v_lines`):\n        i.  Set `output[r, c] = v_lines[c]`.\n    f.  Else (no line requested):\n        i.  `output[r, c]` remains `input[r, c]`.\n\nThis logic seems overly complex regarding tracking which object requested which line. Let's simplify.\n\n**Simpler Revised Hypothesis:**\n1.  Identify largest objects, their colors, and center coordinates (`center_r`, `center_c`). Store these as a list: `[(color1, r1, c1), (color2, r2, c2), ...]`.\n2.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n3.  Create two boolean grids: `h_line_drawn[height, width]` and `v_line_drawn[height, width]`, initialized to False.\n4.  Iterate through the largest objects `(color, r_center, c_center)`:\n    a.  For column `c` from 0 to width-1: Set `h_line_drawn[r_center, c] = True`.\n    b.  For row `r` from 0 to height-1: Set `v_line_drawn[r, c_center] = True`.\n5.  Iterate through the largest objects again `(color, r_center, c_center)`:\n    a.  Draw H line: For column `c` from 0 to width-1:\n        i.   If `v_line_drawn[r_center, c]` is `True` (intersection) AND `(r_center, c)` is NOT this object's center `(r_center, c_center)`:\n             Set `output[r_center, c] = 0`.\n        ii.  Else: # Not an intersection OR it's the object's own center\n             Set `output[r_center, c] = color`.\n    b.  Draw V line: For row `r` from 0 to height-1:\n        i.   If `h_line_drawn[r, c_center]` is `True` (intersection) AND `(r, c_center)` is NOT this object's center `(r_center, c_center)`:\n             Set `output[r, c_center] = 0`.\n        ii.  Else: # Not an intersection OR it's the object's own center\n             Set `output[r, c_center] = color`.\n\nThis still feels wrong because it overwrites everything. What if we combine the \"only modify original 0s\" idea with the \"intersections become 0\" idea?\n\n**Hypothesis v3 (Combining Ideas):**\n1.  Identify largest objects: `largest = [(color1, r1, c1), (color2, r2, c2), ...]`.\n2.  Create `output = input.copy()`.\n3.  Create sets of coordinates for horizontal and vertical lines: `h_coords = set()`, `v_coords = set()`.\n4.  For each `(color, r_center, c_center)` in `largest`:\n    a.  For `c` from 0 to width-1: `h_coords.add((r_center, c))`\n    b.  For `r` from 0 to height-1: `v_coords.add((r, c_center))`\n5.  Create a dictionary mapping line coordinates to colors (handling potential overwrites if multiple objects share a line - perhaps last object wins? Let's assume that for now).\n    *   `line_colors = {}`\n    *   For each `(color, r_center, c_center)` in `largest`:\n        *   For `c` from 0 to width-1: `line_colors[(r_center, c)] = color`\n        *   For `r` from 0 to height-1: `line_colors[(r, c_center)] = color`\n6.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)`:\n    a.  `is_h = (r, c) in h_coords`\n    b.  `is_v = (r, c) in v_coords`\n    c.  If `is_h` and `is_v`: # Intersection\n        i.  Is `(r, c)` the center of any object in `largest`? Find if there exists `(clr, r_cen, c_cen)` in `largest` such that `r == r_cen` and `c == c_cen`.\n        ii. If yes (it's a center): set `output[r, c] = line_colors[(r, c)]` (color of the object centered here).\n        iii. If no (it's an intersection of lines from different objects): set `output[r, c] = 0`.\n    d.  Else if `is_h`: # Only horizontal line\n        i.  If `input[r, c] == 0`: set `output[r, c] = line_colors[(r, c)]`.\n        ii. Else: `output[r, c]` remains `input[r, c]`.\n    e.  Else if `is_v`: # Only vertical line\n        i.  If `input[r, c] == 0`: set `output[r, c] = line_colors[(r, c)]`.\n        ii. Else: `output[r, c]` remains `input[r, c]`.\n    f.  Else (no line): `output[r, c]` remains `input[r, c]`.\n\nLet's test Hypothesis v3 on the problematic points:\n*   Ex 1 (5, 4): `is_h` (Red row 5), `is_v` (Green col 4). Intersection. Is it a center? No (Red center 5,11; Green center 8,4). Output = 0. Matches Expected!\n*   Ex 1 (8, 11): `is_h` (Green row 8), `is_v` (Red col 11). Intersection. Is it a center? No. Output = 0. Matches Expected!\n*   Ex 1 (5, 7): `is_h` (Red row 5), not `is_v`. `input[5,7]=6`. Output remains 6. Expected = 0. **Fails.**\n*   Ex 1 (10, 11): not `is_h`, `is_v` (Red col 11). `input[10,11]=8`. Output remains 8. Expected = 0. **Fails.**\n*   Ex 3 (3, 16): `is_h` (Azure row 3), `is_v` (Green col 16). Intersection. Is it a center? No. Output = 0. Matches Expected! (This was the point that broke the previous intersection hypothesis).\n*   Ex 3 (10, 15): `is_h` (Magenta row 10), not `is_v`. `input[10,15]=3`. Output remains 3. Expected = 0. **Fails.**\n*   Ex 3 (12, 14): Not `is_h`. Not `is_v`. `input[12,14]=3`. Output remains 3. Expected = 0. **Fails.** This point isn't even on a line! Why does it become 0?\n*   Ex 3 (15, 5): `is_h` (Green row 15), `is_v` (Magenta col 4). No, col 5. Not `is_v`. `input[15,5]=2`. Output remains 2. Expected = 0. **Fails.**\n*   Ex 3 (16, 14): Not `is_h`. `is_v` (Azure col 12). No, col 14. Not `is_v`. `input[16,14]=8`. Output remains 8. Expected = 0. **Fails.**\n\nThere are pixels becoming 0 in the expected output that are not on lines or are non-zero input pixels on single lines. This suggests the \"draw lines\" idea might be fundamentally incomplete or wrong.\n\nCould it be noise removal? Removing pixels that are not part of the largest objects *or* the drawn lines?\nLet's try:\n1. Find largest objects, centers, colors.\n2. Create `final_mask = np.zeros_like(input, dtype=bool)`.\n3. Add pixels of largest objects"
