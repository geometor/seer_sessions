"""
Identifies the largest object(s) in the input grid based on pixel count. 
For each largest object, calculates its center based on its bounding box. 
Draws a horizontal line and a vertical line intersecting at this center, 
using the object's color. These lines only color pixels that are originally 
white (0) in the grid. If multiple objects share the maximum size, lines 
are drawn for all of them.
