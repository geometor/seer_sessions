"""
Identifies the largest object(s) in the input grid based on pixel count.
For each largest object, calculates its center based on its bounding box.
Draws a horizontal line and a vertical line corresponding to each largest object's center row and column.
Rule for pixel color updates:
1. Start with a copy of the input grid.
2. Determine the locations of all horizontal and vertical lines based on the centers of the largest objects.
3. For each pixel (r, c):
    a. If it lies at the intersection of a horizontal line (from object A) and a vertical line (from object B):
        i. If (r, c) is the calculated center of ANY largest object, set the pixel to that object's color.
        ii. Otherwise (intersection of lines from different objects, not at a center), set the pixel to 0 (white).
    b. If it lies only on a horizontal line (from object A) and the original input pixel input[r, c] was 0 (white), set the pixel to the color of object A. Otherwise, keep the original input color.
    c. If it lies only on a vertical line (from object B) and the original input pixel input[r, c] was 0 (white), set the pixel to the color of object B. Otherwise, keep the original input color.
    d. If the pixel does not lie on any line, keep the original input color.
Note: If multiple largest objects define the same horizontal or vertical line, the color associated with the line is determined by the object processed last in the iteration.
