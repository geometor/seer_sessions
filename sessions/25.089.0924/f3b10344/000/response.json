These objects can be adjacent to each other horizontally or vertically, separated only by a path of white pixels.\n\nThe transformation involves identifying pairs of adjacent objects that share the *same color*. The white pixels lying directly on the shortest path *between* these same-colored, adjacent objects are then filled with the color azure (8). Objects of different colors, even if adjacent, are not connected. Objects separated by non-white pixels or by more than a direct line of white pixels are also not connected. The original colored objects remain unchanged in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
