task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  background_color: white (0)
  priors: [Objectness, Geometry & Topology]

elements:
  - object_type: rectangle
    description: Contiguous blocks of a single non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: (red(2), magenta(6), blue(1), green(3), yellow(4))
      - position: Coordinates within the grid.
      - shape: Rectangular.
  - object_type: connection
    description: A line or block of azure pixels connecting two objects.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - location: Fills the white space between two adjacent, same-colored objects.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Two objects are adjacent if they are separated only by a direct path (horizontal or vertical) of white pixels.
  - type: color_match
    description: Two adjacent objects have the same non-white color.

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Find all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
  - action: check_adjacency_and_color
    description: For each pair of objects, determine if they are adjacent and have the same color.
  - action: fill_connection
    description: If two objects are adjacent and have the same color, fill the white pixels on the shortest path between them with azure (8).
    target: white pixels between adjacent, same-colored objects.
    result: Filled pixels become azure (8).

transformation_goal: Connect adjacent objects of the same color by filling the intervening white space with azure.
