An object is defined as a contiguous block of pixels sharing the same non-white color (colors 1 through 9). The background is white (color 0).\n2. For every pair of identified objects:\n   a. Check if they have the same color.\n   b. If they share the same color, determine if they are strictly adjacent either horizontally or vertically. Adjacency requires that the objects are separated by a rectangular region composed *entirely* of white pixels (color 0).\n   c. If two same-colored objects are found to be adjacent:\n      i. Identify the rectangular region of white pixels lying directly between them. This region spans the overlapping rows (for horizontal adjacency) or overlapping columns (for vertical adjacency) and fills the columns/rows separating the objects.\n      ii. Fill all pixels within this identified rectangular region with the color azure (8).\n3. The original objects remain unchanged.\n4. The final output grid contains the original objects plus the newly created azure connection regions.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies all contiguous objects of the same non-white color in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of objects, where each object is represented as a dictionary\n              containing its 'color', 'coords' (a set of (row, col) tuples),\n              and 'bbox' (tuple: min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # If the cell is non-white and not yet visited\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                coords = set()\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = r, r, c, c\n                \n                # Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find all connected pixels of the same color\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    coords.add((row, col))\n                    min_r = min(min_r, row)\n                    max_r = max(max_r, row)\n                    min_c = min(min_c, col)\n                    max_c = max(max_c, col)\n                    \n                    # Check neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        # Check bounds and if the neighbor has the same color and hasn't been visited\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           not visited[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == color:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                            \n                objects.append({\n                    'color': color, \n                    'coords': coords, \n                    'bbox': (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)\n                    })\n                \n    return objects\n\ndef find_connection_rectangle(obj1, obj2, grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two objects are adjacent horizontally or vertically with only white pixels\n    forming a solid rectangle between them.
