Transformation Rule:

1. Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is defined as a contiguous block of pixels sharing the same non-white color (colors 1 through 9). The background is white (color 0).
2. For every pair of identified objects:
   a. Check if they have the same color.
   b. If they share the same color, determine if they are strictly adjacent either horizontally or vertically. Adjacency requires that the objects are separated by a rectangular region composed *entirely* of white pixels (color 0).
   c. If two same-colored objects are found to be adjacent:
      i. Identify the rectangular region of white pixels lying directly between them. This region spans the overlapping rows (for horizontal adjacency) or overlapping columns (for vertical adjacency) and fills the columns/rows separating the objects.
      ii. Fill all pixels within this identified rectangular region with the color azure (8).
3. The original objects remain unchanged.
4. The final output grid contains the original objects plus the newly created azure connection regions.
