**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the core concept: connecting adjacent, same-colored objects with azure pixels. However, it failed to accurately define the *shape* and *extent* of these connections. The results show that the connections are not merely lines along adjacent pixels but solid rectangular blocks filling the entire gap defined by the overlapping faces of the adjacent objects. The adjacency check logic needs refinement to precisely identify the white pixels forming this rectangular connection region.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Adjacency and Path Finding:** Instead of finding individual white path pixels, the logic must identify the overlapping rows (for horizontal adjacency) or columns (for vertical adjacency) between the two same-colored objects.
2.  **Define Connection Rectangle:** Based on the overlapping range and the gap between the objects, determine the coordinates of the rectangular block of white pixels that needs to be filled.
3.  **Fill Rectangle:** Modify the code to fill this entire rectangular block with azure (8).
4.  **Re-evaluate Examples:** Ensure the refined logic correctly handles all configurations in the training examples, including cases where multiple objects are adjacent or where objects have different dimensions.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's analyze the adjacencies and expected connection areas for Example 1.
