**Perception:**

The input grids contain multiple distinct rectangular objects composed of single, non-white colors (red, magenta, blue, green, yellow) placed on a white background. These objects can be adjacent to each other horizontally or vertically, separated only by a path of white pixels.

The transformation involves identifying pairs of adjacent objects that share the *same color*. The white pixels lying directly on the shortest path *between* these same-colored, adjacent objects are then filled with the color azure (8). Objects of different colors, even if adjacent, are not connected. Objects separated by non-white pixels or by more than a direct line of white pixels are also not connected. The original colored objects remain unchanged in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  background_color: white (0)
  priors: [Objectness, Geometry & Topology]

elements:
  - object_type: rectangle
    description: Contiguous blocks of a single non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: (red(2), magenta(6), blue(1), green(3), yellow(4))
      - position: Coordinates within the grid.
      - shape: Rectangular.
  - object_type: connection
    description: A line or block of azure pixels connecting two objects.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - location: Fills the white space between two adjacent, same-colored objects.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Two objects are adjacent if they are separated only by a direct path (horizontal or vertical) of white pixels.
  - type: color_match
    description: Two adjacent objects have the same non-white color.

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Find all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
  - action: check_adjacency_and_color
    description: For each pair of objects, determine if they are adjacent and have the same color.
  - action: fill_connection
    description: If two objects are adjacent and have the same color, fill the white pixels on the shortest path between them with azure (8).
    target: white pixels between adjacent, same-colored objects.
    result: Filled pixels become azure (8).

transformation_goal: Connect adjacent objects of the same color by filling the intervening white space with azure.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct objects in the input grid, where an object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color. Record the color and the set of coordinates for each object.
3.  Iterate through all pairs of identified objects.
4.  For each pair of objects (Object A and Object B):
    a.  Check if Object A and Object B have the same color.
    b.  If they have the same color, check if they are adjacent. Adjacency means that there exists at least one pixel in Object A and one pixel in Object B such that they are either in the same row with only white pixels between them, or in the same column with only white pixels between them.
    c.  If they are adjacent and have the same color:
        i.  Identify all the white pixels that lie on the direct horizontal or vertical path(s) connecting the adjacent faces of Object A and Object B.
        ii. For each identified white pixel in the output grid, change its color to azure (8).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
