Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input grids feature a repeating pattern structure. The patterns are arranged in a grid-like fashion, separated by horizontal and vertical lines of a single color (blue in example 1, green in example 2).
2.  **Pattern Size:** The fundamental repeating unit appears to be a 7x7 block, including the surrounding separator lines. This is evident from the separator lines occurring every 7 rows and 7 columns (e.g., column indices 0, 7, 14,... and row indices 0, 7, 14,...).
3.  **Input vs. Output Dimensions:**
    *   Example 1: Input 19x19 -> Output 19x7
    *   Example 2: Input 19x25 -> Output 19x7
    The number of rows remains unchanged, while the number of columns is reduced to 7 in both outputs.
4.  **Content Transformation:** Comparing the input and output grids pixel by pixel, the output grid in both examples corresponds exactly to the first 7 columns (indices 0 through 6) of the respective input grid. The content beyond the 7th column in the input is discarded. The internal details of the patterns within the 7x7 blocks (the yellow shapes in example 1, the blue shapes in example 2) do not influence the transformation rule itself, which seems purely based on grid slicing.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Extract the leftmost repeating block from the input grid.
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - structure: composed of repeating subgrids (patterns)
      - pattern_size: 7x7 (including boundary lines)
      - boundary_lines: single-color lines separating patterns horizontally and vertically
  - type: transformation
    action: select_columns
    parameters:
      - columns: indices 0 through 6 (the first 7 columns)
    input: original grid
    output: new grid with the same number of rows as the input, but only the selected columns
relationships:
  - input_output: The output grid is a vertical slice of the input grid, containing only the first 7 columns. The number of rows is preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Determine the number of rows in the input grid.
3.  Create a new output grid that has the same number of rows as the input grid and exactly 7 columns.
4.  For each row in the input grid, copy the pixel values from the first 7 columns (column indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) into the corresponding row of the new output grid.
5.  Return the newly created 7-column-wide grid as the output.
```python
"""
Extract the leftmost 7 columns from the input grid, preserving all rows. 
The input grid features repeating patterns separated by boundary lines, 
suggesting the fundamental unit might be 7x7, but the transformation rule 
only relies on selecting the first 7 columns, regardless of the internal content 
or repeating structure beyond that point.

The transformation rule involves identifying horizontal bands of 7 rows within the input grid. 
Within each band, the grid is composed of repeating 7x7 blocks (including boundary lines). 
The goal is to select one representative 7x7 block pattern for each band and stack these 
selected blocks vertically to form the output grid.

The selection rule for the representative block within a band is as follows:
1. Identify all unique 7x7 block patterns within the band.
2. Count the frequency of occurrence for each unique pattern.
3. Find the minimum frequency among all patterns in the band.
4. Identify all patterns that occur with this minimum frequency (the "least frequent" patterns).
5. Select the pattern corresponding to the *first* (leftmost) block in the band that matches one of these least frequent patterns.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code failed because the hypothesis about selecting the leftmost 7x7 block within 7-row bands was incorrect. The failure modes (incorrect output dimensions and content) indicated a misunderstanding of how the input grid's structure relates to the output. The input dimensions (19x19 and 19x25) are not perfect multiples of the apparent 7x7 block size, which was a key missed observation.

The revised strategy involves analyzing the relationship between output pixels and corresponding input pixels across horizontally repeating segments. The input grid can be viewed as horizontally tiled segments, each 7 columns wide. The core hypothesis is that each pixel in the 7-column-wide output grid
