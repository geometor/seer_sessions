The failure modes (incorrect output dimensions and content) indicated a misunderstanding of how the input grid's structure relates to the output. The input dimensions (19x19 and 19x25) are not perfect multiples of the apparent 7x7 block size, which was a key missed observation.\n\nThe revised strategy involves analyzing the relationship between output pixels and corresponding input pixels across horizontally repeating segments. The input grid can be viewed as horizontally tiled segments, each 7 columns wide. The core hypothesis is that each pixel in the 7-column-wide output grid"
