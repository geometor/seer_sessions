"""
Extract the leftmost 7 columns from the input grid, preserving all rows. 
The input grid features repeating patterns separated by boundary lines, 
suggesting the fundamental unit might be 7x7, but the transformation rule 
only relies on selecting the first 7 columns, regardless of the internal content 
or repeating structure beyond that point.
