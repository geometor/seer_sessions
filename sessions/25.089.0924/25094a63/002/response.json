            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial hypothesis identified the core transformation: finding maximal monochromatic rectangles and filling them with yellow (4) based on a size criterion. The previous code implemented this using a minimum area threshold of 25, which resulted in incorrect outputs for both training examples. The mismatches indicate that either the area threshold is incorrect, or the method for identifying the \"maximal monochromatic rectangles\" needs refinement, or both.\n\nThe strategy will be:\n1.  Re-evaluate the properties of the rectangles that *are* filled in the expected outputs.\n2.  Use code execution to accurately find all maximal monochromatic rectangles in the inputs and calculate their areas.\n3.  Compare the identified rectangles and their areas with those that are actually transformed in the expected outputs.\n4.  Determine the correct minimum area threshold based on this comparison.\n5.  Verify if *all* rectangles meeting the criteria are transformed, or if there are exceptions.\n6.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program based on the refined understanding.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's find the maximal monochromatic rectangles and their areas for each training input and compare them to the expected output changes.\n\n"
