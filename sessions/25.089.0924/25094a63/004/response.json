            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core concept: finding monochromatic rectangles and filling them based on a size criterion. However, the execution failed completely on both training examples, producing outputs identical to the inputs (except for the incorrect score calculation, which seems to reflect comparing the input to the expected output rather than the *actual* output of the function).\n\nThis failure indicates two potential issues:\n1.  **Incorrect Threshold:** The minimum area threshold was initially hypothesized as 36 based on `train_2` but refined by considering *all* filled rectangles across both examples.\n2.  **Flawed Rectangle Identification:** The `find_maximal_monochromatic_rectangles` function in the provided code snippet did not correctly identify the target rectangles. The logic for finding rectangles, ensuring maximality, and handling visited cells needs revision.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Correct the Area Threshold:** Based on a re-analysis of *all* filled rectangles in both examples, the minimum area appears to be 25 (seen in `train_2`), not 36.\n2.  **Refine Rectangle Definition:** Reiterate the definition of a *maximal monochromatic rectangle*. It must be composed of a single color and cannot be expanded in any cardinal direction without changing color or leaving the grid.\n3.  **Update Logic:** The core transformation logic remains: find these maximal rectangles, check their area against the *corrected* threshold (>= 25), and fill qualifying rectangles with yellow (4). The implementation details of finding these rectangles are deferred to the coder phase but the specification must be clear.\n\n**Detailed Analysis of Examples and Threshold:**\n\n*   **Train 1:**\n    *   Input Rect 1: Gray (6), Location (2, 5), Size 5x10, Area 50. Output: Filled Yellow. (50 >= 25)\n    *   Input Rect 2: Azure (8), Location (16, 13), Size 7x8, Area 56. Output: Filled Yellow. (56 >= 25)\n*   **Train 2:**\n    *   Input Rect 1: Black (8), Location (2, 4), Size 6x6, Area 36. Output: Filled Yellow. (36 >= 25)\n    *   Input Rect 2: Red (2), Location (2, 20), Size 6x8, Area 48. Output: Filled Yellow. (48 >= 25)\n    *   Input Rect 3: Green (3), Location (12, 22), Size 5x5, Area 25. Output: Filled Yellow. (25 >= 25)\n    *   Input Rect 4: Blue (1), Location (17, 10), Size 6x8, Area 48. Output: Filled Yellow. (48 >= 25)\n\nThe consistent pattern is that all maximal monochromatic rectangles with an area of 25 or greater are filled with yellow.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
