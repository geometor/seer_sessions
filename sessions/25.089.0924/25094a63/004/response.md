**General Assessment**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core concept: finding monochromatic rectangles and filling them based on a size criterion. However, the execution failed completely on both training examples, producing outputs identical to the inputs (except for the incorrect score calculation, which seems to reflect comparing the input to the expected output rather than the *actual* output of the function).

This failure indicates two potential issues:
1.  **Incorrect Threshold:** The minimum area threshold was initially hypothesized as 36 based on `train_2` but refined by considering *all* filled rectangles across both examples.
2.  **Flawed Rectangle Identification:** The `find_maximal_monochromatic_rectangles` function in the provided code snippet did not correctly identify the target rectangles. The logic for finding rectangles, ensuring maximality, and handling visited cells needs revision.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Correct the Area Threshold:** Based on a re-analysis of *all* filled rectangles in both examples, the minimum area appears to be 25 (seen in `train_2`), not 36.
2.  **Refine Rectangle Definition:** Reiterate the definition of a *maximal monochromatic rectangle*. It must be composed of a single color and cannot be expanded in any cardinal direction without changing color or leaving the grid.
3.  **Update Logic:** The core transformation logic remains: find these maximal rectangles, check their area against the *corrected* threshold (>= 25), and fill qualifying rectangles with yellow (4). The implementation details of finding these rectangles are deferred to the coder phase but the specification must be clear.

**Detailed Analysis of Examples and Threshold:**

*   **Train 1:**
    *   Input Rect 1: Gray (6), Location (2, 5), Size 5x10, Area 50. Output: Filled Yellow. (50 >= 25)
    *   Input Rect 2: Azure (8), Location (16, 13), Size 7x8, Area 56. Output: Filled Yellow. (56 >= 25)
*   **Train 2:**
    *   Input Rect 1: Black (8), Location (2, 4), Size 6x6, Area 36. Output: Filled Yellow. (36 >= 25)
    *   Input Rect 2: Red (2), Location (2, 20), Size 6x8, Area 48. Output: Filled Yellow. (48 >= 25)
    *   Input Rect 3: Green (3), Location (12, 22), Size 5x5, Area 25. Output: Filled Yellow. (25 >= 25)
    *   Input Rect 4: Blue (1), Location (17, 10), Size 6x8, Area 48. Output: Filled Yellow. (48 >= 25)

The consistent pattern is that all maximal monochromatic rectangles with an area of 25 or greater are filled with yellow.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
GridProperties:
  - Input and output grids share the same dimensions.
  - Most pixels remain unchanged between input and output.

Objects:
  - Type: Maximal Monochromatic Rectangle
  - Definition: A rectangular block of pixels within the grid where all pixels share the same original color, and the rectangle cannot be expanded horizontally or vertically without encompassing pixels of a different color or extending beyond the grid boundaries.
  - Properties:
      - Color (the single color of the pixels within the rectangle in the input grid)
      - Position (row, column of the top-left pixel)
      - Size (height, width)
      - Area (height * width)

Action:
  - Name: ConditionalFill
  - Target: Objects of type Maximal Monochromatic Rectangle.
  - Condition: The 'Area' property of the object must be greater than or equal to 25.
  - Effect: If the condition is met, all pixels within the object's boundary in the output grid are changed to yellow (color 4). Otherwise, the pixels remain unchanged from the input.

Relationships:
  - The transformation identifies all instances of the specified object type (Maximal Monochromatic Rectangle).
  - It filters these objects based on a property threshold (Area >= 25).
  - It applies a specific modification (fill with yellow) to the pixels corresponding to the filtered objects.
  - Pixels not part of a qualifying object remain unchanged.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify all *maximal monochromatic rectangles* present in the input grid. A rectangle is monochromatic if all pixels within its boundaries have the same color. A monochromatic rectangle is maximal if it cannot be extended in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) while remaining monochromatic and within the grid's bounds.
3.  For each identified maximal monochromatic rectangle:
    a.  Calculate its area by multiplying its height and width.
    b.  Check if the calculated area is greater than or equal to 25.
    c.  If the area is 25 or greater, modify the output grid by changing the color of all pixels within that rectangle's boundaries to yellow (color 4).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
