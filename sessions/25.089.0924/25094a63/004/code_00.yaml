GridProperties:
  - Input and output grids share the same dimensions.
  - Most pixels remain unchanged between input and output.

Objects:
  - Type: Maximal Monochromatic Rectangle
  - Definition: A rectangular block of pixels within the grid where all pixels share the same original color, and the rectangle cannot be expanded horizontally or vertically without encompassing pixels of a different color or extending beyond the grid boundaries.
  - Properties:
      - Color (the single color of the pixels within the rectangle in the input grid)
      - Position (row, column of the top-left pixel)
      - Size (height, width)
      - Area (height * width)

Action:
  - Name: ConditionalFill
  - Target: Objects of type Maximal Monochromatic Rectangle.
  - Condition: The 'Area' property of the object must be greater than or equal to 25.
  - Effect: If the condition is met, all pixels within the object's boundary in the output grid are changed to yellow (color 4). Otherwise, the pixels remain unchanged from the input.

Relationships:
  - The transformation identifies all instances of the specified object type (Maximal Monochromatic Rectangle).
  - It filters these objects based on a property threshold (Area >= 25).
  - It applies a specific modification (fill with yellow) to the pixels corresponding to the filtered objects.
  - Pixels not part of a qualifying object remain unchanged.
