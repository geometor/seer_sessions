GridProperties:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - Most pixels remain unchanged.

Objects:
  - Type: Maximal Monochromatic Rectangles
  - Definition: Rectangular areas composed of a single color that cannot be extended horizontally or vertically without changing color or going out of bounds.
  - Properties:
      - Color (original color in the input)
      - Position (top-left corner coordinates)
      - Size (width, height)
      - Area (width * height)

Action:
  - Name: FillRectangle
  - Target: Maximal monochromatic rectangles meeting a specific criterion.
  - Criterion: Area >= 36.
  - Effect: All pixels within the target rectangle's boundaries are changed to yellow (color 4).

Relationships:
  - The transformation identifies specific objects (maximal monochromatic rectangles) based on a property (area >= 36) and applies a uniform action (fill with yellow) to them.
  - The final output is the input grid modified by these fill actions.
