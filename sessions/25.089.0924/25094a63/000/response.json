            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions. By visually comparing the input and output grids in the examples, I observe the following:\n\n1.  **Grid Size:** The grid dimensions remain constant (30x30 in these examples).\n2.  **Background:** Most pixels in the grid remain unchanged between input and output.\n3.  **Transformation:** Specific rectangular areas within the input grid are completely filled with yellow pixels (color 4) in the output grid.\n4.  **Target Rectangles:** The rectangles that are filled appear to be composed of a single, uniform color in the input grid (monochromatic).\n5.  **Multiple Rectangles:** In both examples, more than one such monochromatic rectangle is transformed. In `train_1`, a gray (6) rectangle and an azure (8) rectangle are filled. In `train_2`, three black (8) rectangles and one blue (1) rectangle are filled.\n6.  **Size Matters:** Not all monochromatic rectangles are filled. The ones that are filled seem relatively large. Comparing the sizes (area = width * height):\n    *   `train_1`: Gray (5x10 = 50 pixels), Azure (7x8 = 56 pixels).\n    *   `train_2`: Black (6x6 = 36 pixels), Black (8x8 = 64 pixels), Black (7x7 = 49 pixels), Blue (7x8 = 56 pixels).\n7.  **Threshold:** The smallest rectangle filled in either example has an area of 36 (the 6x6 black rectangle in `train_2`). It seems plausible that there's a minimum area threshold for a monochromatic rectangle to be filled. Let's hypothesize the threshold is 36. All filled rectangles in both examples (50, 56, 36, 64, 49, 56) meet or exceed this threshold. We need to assume that any monochromatic rectangles with area >= 36 *not* shown as filled were either not present or not *maximal* (i.e., they were part of a larger non-rectangular monochromatic shape). The rule likely applies to *maximal* monochromatic rectangles (those that cannot be extended further in any direction while remaining monochromatic).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
