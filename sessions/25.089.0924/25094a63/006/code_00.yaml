GridProperties:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions (W, H).
  - Most pixels remain unchanged between input and output.

Objects:
  - Type: Maximal Monochromatic Rectangle
  - Definition: A rectangular region within the grid where all pixels have the same color ('C'), and the rectangle cannot be expanded further up, down, left, or right without including a pixel of a different color or exceeding the grid boundaries.
  - Properties:
      - Color (C): The single color of the pixels within the rectangle in the input grid.
      - Position (r, c): The row and column index of the top-left pixel.
      - Size (h, w): The height and width of the rectangle in pixels.
      - Area (A): Calculated as h * w.

Action:
  - Name: ConditionalFillYellow
  - Target: Identified Maximal Monochromatic Rectangles.
  - Condition: The rectangle's Area (A) must be greater than or equal to 36 (A >= 36).
  - Effect: If the condition is met, all pixels within the rectangle's boundaries (from (r, c) to (r+h-1, c+w-1)) in the *output* grid are set to yellow (color 4). Otherwise, the pixels remain unchanged from the input.

TransformationRule:
  - Find all objects matching the 'Maximal Monochromatic Rectangle' definition in the input grid.
  - For each found object, apply the 'ConditionalFillYellow' action.
  - The final output grid is the result of applying these actions to a copy of the input grid.
