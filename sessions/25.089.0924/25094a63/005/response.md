"""
The transformation identifies all maximal monochromatic rectangles within the input grid. 
A rectangle is monochromatic if all its pixels share the same color. 
A rectangle is maximal if it cannot be expanded in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) 
without either going out of bounds or including a pixel of a different color.

For each maximal monochromatic rectangle found, its area (height * width) is calculated. 
If the area is 25 or greater, all pixels within the bounds of that rectangle in the output grid 
are replaced with the color yellow (4). 
If the area is less than 25, the pixels within that rectangle remain unchanged from the input grid. 
All pixels outside of any maximal monochromatic rectangle also remain unchanged.
