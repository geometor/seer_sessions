*   **Perception:**
    The input grids contain multiple distinct, non-overlapping objects composed of single, non-white colors, placed on a white background. Some of these objects form hollow rectangular frames. The transformation identifies these specific hollow rectangular frames and fills their interior (the white pixels enclosed by the frame) with the same color as the frame itself. Objects that are not complete hollow rectangles (e.g., U-shapes, solid shapes, lines, or shapes with internal structures other than just white) are left unchanged. The background remains white.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input grid to identify distinct objects (contiguous blocks of the same non-white color).
    2.  For each identified object:
        a.  Determine if it forms a perfect rectangular frame:
            i.  Check if it has a uniform thickness (likely 1 pixel thick based on examples).
            ii. Check if all pixels forming the object constitute the perimeter of a rectangle.
            iii. Check if all pixels immediately inside this perimeter are white (value 0).
        b.  If the object is confirmed to be a complete, hollow rectangular frame:
            i.  Note the color of the frame.
            ii. Identify the bounding box of the frame.
            iii. Change the color of all white pixels located strictly within this bounding box to the color of the frame.
    3.  Leave all other objects and background pixels unchanged.
    4.  Output the modified grid.

A hollow rectangular frame is defined as:
1. A contiguous object of a single non-white color.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis (simply filling hollow rectangles) was incorrect. The comparison between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs reveals a more complex process: pattern transfer. The transformation identifies specific hollow rectangles (targets) and fills their interiors with a pattern derived from another object (source) found within the grid. The key steps missed previously were identifying the correct source object, extracting the pattern from its interior, selecting the correct target rectangles (specifically, the top two largest by area with tie-breaking), and applying the pattern using the target's color. The provided examples consistently follow this pattern-tiling logic.

**Metrics and Object Analysis:**

We need to analyze objects based on type (hollow rectangle vs. other), bounding box area (for hollow rectangles), bounding box interior content (specifically non-background pixel count), and overall pixel count.
