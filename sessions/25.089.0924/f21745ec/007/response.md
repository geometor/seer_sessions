"""
Identifies all distinct, single-color objects in the input grid. Classifies 
objects into 'simple hollow rectangles' (at least 3x3, pixels exactly form the 
bounding box perimeter, interior is all white) and 'other objects'. 
Selects one 'other object' as the pattern source based on the largest pixel 
count (ties broken by top-most, then left-most bounding box corner). Extracts the 
pattern from the interior of the pattern source's bounding box. Selects the two 
'simple hollow rectangles' with the largest bounding box area (ties broken by 
top-most, then left-most corner). Tiles the extracted pattern into the interior 
of the selected target rectangles, using the color of each target rectangle's 
frame for the non-background parts of the pattern. Outputs the modified grid.
