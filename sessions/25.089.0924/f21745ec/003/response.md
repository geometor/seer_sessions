"""
Identifies all distinct, single-color, simple hollow rectangular frames within 
the input grid. A simple hollow rectangle has a 1-pixel thick frame, encloses 
only white pixels, and is at least 3x3 in size. From these identified 
rectangles, it selects the two with the largest bounding box area. Ties in area 
are broken by selecting the rectangle with the smaller top row index, and 
further ties are broken by the smaller left column index. Finally, it fills the 
white interiors of these selected two rectangles with the color of their 
respective frames. All other pixels and objects remain unchanged.
