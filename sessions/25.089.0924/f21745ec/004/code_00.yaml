objects:
  - type: background
    properties:
      color: white
      value: 0
      role: static_canvas
  - type: simple_hollow_rectangle
    properties:
      color: non-white (1-9)
      value: 1-9
      connectivity: contiguous
      form: perfect rectangular frame (>= 3x3)
      thickness: 1 pixel
      interior: contains only white pixels (value 0)
      role: potential_target
    attributes:
      bounding_box: (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
      area: height * width of bounding_box
  - type: pattern_source
    properties:
      color: non-white (1-9)
      value: 1-9
      connectivity: contiguous
      form: any shape that is *not* a simple_hollow_rectangle
      role: provides_fill_pattern
    attributes:
      bounding_box: (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
      pixel_count: number of non-white pixels in the object
      pattern_grid: 2D array representing the pixels strictly *inside* the bounding box of the source object
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects are placed on the background, non-overlapping.
  - type: selection_criteria
    description: Two selection processes occur based on object type and attributes.
    criteria_target:
      - object_type: simple_hollow_rectangle
      - metric: area (descending)
      - tie-breaker-1: bounding_box min_row (ascending)
      - tie-breaker-2: bounding_box min_col (ascending)
      - quantity: 2
    criteria_source:
      - object_type: not simple_hollow_rectangle
      - metric: pixel_count (descending)
      - tie-breaker-1: bounding_box min_row (ascending)
      - tie-breaker-2: bounding_box min_col (ascending)
      - quantity: 1
actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    input: grid
    output: list of all distinct non-white objects with properties (color, pixels, bbox, pixel_count)
  - name: classify_objects
    input: list of objects
    output: two lists - simple_hollow_rectangles (with area calculated), pattern_sources
  - name: select_pattern_source
    input: list of pattern_sources
    output: the single pattern_source object meeting criteria_source
  - name: extract_pattern
    input: pattern_source object, grid
    output: pattern_grid (2D array derived from pixels within the source's bbox, potentially excluding frame if source resembles a filled rect)
    details: Pattern coordinates are relative to the top-left interior corner of the source bbox. Color information in the pattern itself is ignored; only shape is used.
  - name: select_target_rectangles
    input: list of simple_hollow_rectangles
    output: the two target rectangles meeting criteria_target
  - name: tile_fill_interior
    input: target rectangle, pattern_grid, target_color (from target rectangle frame)
    output: modified grid section
    process: Iterate through the white pixels strictly inside the target rectangle's bounding box. For each interior pixel (r, c), calculate its relative position (r - min_r - 1, c - min_c - 1). Use the modulo operator with the pattern_grid dimensions to find the corresponding pattern pixel. If the pattern pixel is non-white (indicating part of the pattern shape), change the output grid pixel at (r, c) to the target_color.
transformation_scope: Applies only to the white pixels inside the two selected target rectangles. All other pixels remain unchanged.
