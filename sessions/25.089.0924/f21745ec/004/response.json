            "text": "**Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the action of filling hollow rectangles but failed to capture two crucial nuances:\n1.  **Selectivity:** Not all hollow rectangles are filled. The transformation specifically targets the *two* hollow rectangles with the largest bounding box areas, using top-row then left-column indices as tie-breakers.\n2.  **Filling Method:** The interior is not filled with a solid color. Instead, a pattern is extracted from a \"pattern source\" object within the input grid and tiled across the interior of the selected target rectangles. The pattern source appears to be the largest object (by pixel count, with top-left tie-breaking) that is *not* a simple hollow rectangle. The color used for tiling matches the frame color of the target rectangle being filled.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the object identification and transformation steps:\n1.  Categorize objects into \"simple hollow rectangles\" and \"other\" (potential pattern sources).\n2.  Implement logic to find the largest non-hollow-rectangle object as the pattern source and extract its internal pattern.\n3.  Implement logic to find the two largest hollow rectangles based on area and tie-breaking rules.\n4.  Implement a pattern tiling mechanism to fill the interiors of the selected rectangles using their frame color.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's analyze the objects in each example to confirm the pattern source and target selection criteria. We need bounding boxes, areas, pixel counts, and whether they are simple hollow rectangles.\n\n"

Calculate the bounding box area (`height * width`) for hollow rectangles.\n    *   Categorize objects into two groups: \"simple hollow rectangles\" and \"others\" (potential pattern sources).\n\n2.  **Select Pattern Source:**\n    *   From the \"others\" group, select the single object with the highest `pixel_count`.\n    *   If there's a tie in `pixel_count`, choose the one with the smallest `min_r`.\n    *   If there's still a tie, choose the one with the smallest `min_c`. This is the `pattern_source_object`.\n\n3.  **Extract Pattern:**\n    *   Get the bounding box (`ps_min_r`, `ps_min_c`, `ps_max_r`, `ps_max_c`) of the `pattern_source_object`.\n    *   Create a `pattern_grid` representing the *interior* area of the source's bounding box (size: `(ps_max_r - ps_min_r - 1) x (ps_max_c - ps_min_c - 1)`).\n    *   Populate the `pattern_grid` by copying the colors from the corresponding cells in the input grid, offset by `(ps_min_r + 1, ps_min_c + 1)`. (Essentially, capture the shape/colors inside the source's bounding box).\n\n4.  **Select Target Rectangles:**\n    *   From the \"simple hollow rectangles\" group, sort them based on `area` (descending), then `min_r` (ascending), then `min_c` (ascending).\n    *   Select the top two rectangles from the sorted list. These are the `target_rectangles`.\n\n5.  **Tile Fill Interiors:**\n    *   Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n    *   For each of the two `target_rectangles`:\n        a.  Get its bounding box (`tr_min_r`, `tr_min_c`, `tr_max_r`, `tr_max_c`) and frame `color`.\n        b.  Get the dimensions of the `pattern_grid` (`pattern_h`, `pattern_w`).\n        c.  Iterate through each cell (`r`, `c`) within the *interior* of the target rectangle's bounding box (from `tr_min_r + 1` to `tr_max_r - 1`, and `tr_min_c + 1` to `tr_max_c - 1`).\n        d.  Calculate the corresponding position within the `pattern_grid`: `pattern_r = (r - (tr_min_r + 1)) % pattern_h` and `pattern_c = (c - (tr_min_c + 1)) % pattern_w`.\n        e.  Check the value/color at `pattern_grid[pattern_r][pattern_c]`.\n        f.  If the value at `pattern_grid[pattern_r][pattern_c]` is *not* white (0), set the pixel at `output_grid[r][c]` to the target rectangle's frame `color`. Otherwise, leave it as white (0).\n\n6.  **Output:** Return the modified output grid."
