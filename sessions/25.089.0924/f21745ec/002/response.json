            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempt failed because it correctly identified simple hollow rectangles but incorrectly assumed *all* such rectangles should be filled. The results show that only a specific subset of these rectangles is filled in each example. The key challenge is to determine the selection criteria for which hollow rectangles are filled.\n\nThe analysis of the failed examples reveals:\n1.  The code incorrectly filled shapes that were not simple hollow rectangles (e.g., the Azure shape in Ex2, Ex3; the Gray shape in Ex1). This points to a potential bug in the `is_hollow_rectangle` implementation or its interpretation during execution, as the logic described *should* have rejected these shapes.\n2.  Even among the correctly identified simple hollow rectangles, only some were filled in the expected output (e.g., in Ex1, Green and Yellow were filled, but Red and Orange were not, despite all being simple hollow rectangles).\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Refine the definition of the target object: A \"simple hollow rectangle\" (1-pixel thick frame, all-white interior, min 3x3 size).\n2.  Assume the `is_hollow_rectangle` function *can* correctly identify these.\n3.  Analyze the properties (size, position, color) of the simple hollow rectangles that *are* filled versus those that are *not*.\n4.  Formulate a hypothesis based on these distinguishing properties. The most promising hypothesis is based on size: the two largest simple hollow rectangles are selected, with ties broken by top-left position.\n5.  Update the facts and natural language program based on this refined understanding.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's gather data on the simple hollow rectangles identified in each input and note which ones are filled in the output. We need object color, bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col), area (H*W), and whether it's filled.\n\n**Tool Code: Analyze Example 1**\n"
