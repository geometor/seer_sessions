**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis (simply filling hollow rectangles) was incorrect. The comparison between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs reveals a more complex process: pattern transfer. The transformation identifies specific hollow rectangles (targets) and fills their interiors with a pattern derived from another object (source) found within the grid. The key steps missed previously were identifying the correct source object, extracting the pattern from its interior, selecting the correct target rectangles (specifically, the top two largest by area with tie-breaking), and applying the pattern using the target's color. The provided examples consistently follow this pattern-tiling logic.

**Metrics and Object Analysis:**

We need to analyze objects based on type (hollow rectangle vs. other), bounding box area (for hollow rectangles), bounding box interior content (specifically non-background pixel count), and overall pixel count.
