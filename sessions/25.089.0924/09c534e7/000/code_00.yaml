task_description: Fill enclosed blue areas based on an internal seed color.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors 0-9.
  - element: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: Surrounds shapes, constrains fill.
  - element: shape
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      form: Contiguous area of pixels.
      role: Defines a boundary or container. May enclose a seed pixel.
  - element: seed_pixel
    properties:
      color: non-blue (1) and non-white (0) (e.g., red-2, green-3, yellow-4, magenta-6)
      location: Situated within a blue shape.
      quantity: Appears to be at most one per blue shape in examples.
      role: Initiates and determines the color of the fill operation.
  - element: filled_area
    properties:
      color: Same as the seed_pixel color.
      location: Replaces the blue pixels within the shape that are reachable from the seed_pixel.
      derivation: Result of the fill action.

actions:
  - action: identify_shapes
    description: Locate all contiguous blue (1) shapes in the input grid.
  - action: find_seed
    description: For each blue shape, check if it contains exactly one non-blue, non-white pixel. If found, identify its color and location.
  - action: flood_fill
    description: For shapes containing a seed, perform a fill operation.
    details:
      start_point: Location of the seed_pixel.
      fill_color: Color of the seed_pixel.
      target_color: blue (1).
      boundary: Pixels that are not blue (1) in the original input grid act as boundaries.
      connectivity: 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right).
      effect: Changes the color of reachable blue (1) pixels within the shape to the fill_color.

relationships:
  - relationship: containment
    subject: seed_pixel
    object: shape (blue)
    description: A seed pixel must be located inside a blue shape.
  - relationship: constraint
    subject: shape (blue boundary) / background (white)
    object: flood_fill action
    description: The fill action is constrained by the boundaries of the original blue shape and does not extend into the white background or other shapes.
  - relationship: determination
    subject: seed_pixel color
    object: filled_area color
    description: The color of the seed pixel determines the color used for the fill.
