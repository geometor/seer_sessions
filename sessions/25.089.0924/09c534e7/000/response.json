            "text": "**Perception of the Task**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9).\n2.  **Key Objects:** The primary objects are contiguous shapes made of blue (1) pixels, often enclosing other colored pixels. The background is white (0).\n3.  **Internal Pixels:** Within some blue shapes, there are single pixels of other colors (green-3, yellow-4, red-2, magenta-6 in the examples). These act as \"seed\" pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a \"fill\" operation originating from these seed pixels.\n5.  **Fill Behavior:**\n    *   The fill uses the color of the seed pixel.\n    *   It spreads outwards from the seed pixel to adjacent (up, down, left, right) blue (1) pixels.\n    *   The fill is contained entirely within the boundary of the original blue shape that enclosed the seed. It does not color the white background or pixels outside the original blue area.\n    *   Blue shapes that do not contain a seed pixel remain unchanged.\n    *   The original seed pixel retains its color and position.\n    *   The blue pixels forming the outermost boundary of the shape generally remain blue, unless the fill reaches them from the inside. Essentially, the fill replaces the *internal* blue area connected to the seed.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
