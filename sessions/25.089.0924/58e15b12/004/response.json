            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation mechanism: diagonal (down-right) path tracing with wrap-around for azure (8) and green (3) pixels, and marking collisions with magenta (6). However, the execution results show that the initial assumption about *which* pixels initiate these paths was incorrect. Instead of *all* azure and green pixels starting a path, the comparison between inputs and expected outputs strongly suggests that only a *single representative pixel* for each color group initiates a path. The most consistent representative across the examples appears to be the **top-leftmost pixel** of each color present in the input. The incorrect code generated paths from every pixel, leading to the output grids being almost entirely filled.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Modify the logic to first identify the single top-leftmost coordinate for azure (8) and the single top-leftmost coordinate for green (3) in the input grid.\n2.  Trace the diagonal path starting *only* from these identified coordinates (if they exist).\n3.  Combine the paths and handle collisions as before.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nLet's verify the top-leftmost starting points for each example.\n\n"
