Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** Contains a background of white pixels (0) and two distinct objects, one azure (8) and one green (3). These objects vary in shape (sometimes resembling 'L's, sometimes vertical lines) and position across the examples.
2.  **Output Grid:** Shows the result of a transformation applied to the input objects. The background remains white. The original azure and green pixels appear to have moved, tracing paths across the grid. A new color, magenta (6), appears in some outputs at specific locations.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve movement. Each pixel of the initial azure and green objects follows a diagonal path (down one step, right one step) across the grid.
4.  **Boundary Interaction (Wrap-around):** When a path reaches the bottom edge of the grid, it wraps around to the top edge in the *next column to the right*. Similarly, when a path reaches the right edge, it wraps around to the left edge in the *next row down*. This continues until the path effectively fills or traverses the entire grid dimensions.
5.  **Object Interaction (Collision):** In examples train_2 and train_3, a magenta pixel (6) appears in the output. Observing its position relative to the traced paths of the azure and green objects reveals that magenta appears precisely where an azure path and a green path intersect or overlap.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: obj1
    color: azure (8)
    initial_state: Present in the input grid as a contiguous shape. Position and specific shape vary between examples.
    properties: Consists of one or more pixels.
  - id: obj2
    color: green (3)
    initial_state: Present in the input grid as a contiguous shape. Position and specific shape vary between examples.
    properties: Consists of one or more pixels.
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    initial_state: Fills the rest of the input grid.
    properties: The default color.
actions:
  - action: trace_path
    actor: each pixel of obj1 and obj2
    details:
      - Each non-white pixel from the input grid initiates a path.
      - The path moves diagonally, one step down and one step right, per step.
      - Boundary Handling (Wrap-around):
        - If row index exceeds grid height - 1, reset row to 0 and increment column index.
        - If column index exceeds grid width - 1, reset column to 0 and increment row index (apply row wrap-around logic if needed).
        - The path effectively continues until it returns to the starting column after traversing all rows, or vice-versa. (Essentially traces across the grid space).
  - action: render_output
    details:
      - Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized to white (0).
      - Mark all cells visited by the path of an azure pixel with azure (8).
      - Mark all cells visited by the path of a green pixel with green (3).
  - action: handle_collision
    details:
      - Identify cells in the output grid that were marked by *both* an azure path and a green path.
      - Change the color of these collision cells to magenta (6).
relationships:
  - type: interaction
    between: obj1_path, obj2_path
    result: Where paths overlap, the pixel color becomes magenta (6) in the final output, overwriting the azure (8) or green (3).
grid_properties:
  - size: Varies between examples, but output size matches input size.
  - coordinate_system: (row, column), starting from (0, 0) at the top-left.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Create two temporary grids or sets to store the coordinates visited by the paths originating from azure pixels and green pixels, respectively. Call them `azure_path_coords` and `green_path_coords`.
3.  Iterate through each cell (row `r`, column `c`) of the input grid.
4.  If the input cell `(r, c)` contains an azure pixel (8):
    *   Start tracing a path from `(r, c)`. Let the current position be `(curr_r, curr_c) = (r, c)`.
    *   Add `(curr_r, curr_c)` to `azure_path_coords`.
    *   Repeat `grid_height * grid_width` times (or until the path repeats, though full traversal seems intended):
        *   Move diagonally: `next_r = curr_r + 1`, `next_c = curr_c + 1`.
        *   Apply wrap-around logic:
            *   If `next_r >= grid_height`, set `next_r = 0` and `next_c = (next_c + 1) % grid_width`. *Correction: Wrap-around logic might be simpler: `next_r %= grid_height`, `next_c %= grid_width` after incrementing independently? Let's re-check train_1 output.* Re-evaluating train_1: Azure at (7,3) -> (8,4) -> ... -> (21, 16) -> (0, 17). Green at (1,12) -> ... -> (10, 21) -> (11, 0). It seems row wrap happens independently of column wrap. Okay, revised wrap-around: `next_r = (curr_r + 1) % grid_height`, `next_c = (curr_c + 1) % grid_width`.
        *   Set `curr_r = next_r`, `curr_c = next_c`.
        *   Add the new `(curr_r, curr_c)` to `azure_path_coords`.
5.  If the input cell `(r, c)` contains a green pixel (3):
    *   Perform the same path tracing as step 4, but add the coordinates to `green_path_coords`.
6.  After iterating through all input cells, populate the output grid:
    *   For each coordinate `(pr, pc)` in `azure_path_coords`: Set `output_grid[pr][pc] = 8` (azure).
    *   For each coordinate `(gr, gc)` in `green_path_coords`: Set `output_grid[gr][gc] = 3` (green).
7.  Handle collisions:
    *   Iterate through all coordinates `(cr, cc)` present in *both* `azure_path_coords` and `green_path_coords`.
    *   For each such collision coordinate, set `output_grid[cr][cc] = 6` (magenta).
8.  Return the final output grid.
