Collisions between the paths are marked with magenta (6).\n\n1. Find the top-leftmost coordinate (minimum row, then minimum column) for the azure color (8) in the input grid.\n2. Find the top-leftmost coordinate for the green color (3) in the input grid.\n3. If an azure starting point exists, trace a diagonal path (down one, right one) starting from that point. Apply wrap-around: if the next row exceeds the grid height, wrap to row 0; if the next column exceeds the grid width, wrap to column 0. Store all coordinates visited by this path.\n4. If a green starting point exists, trace a similar diagonal path starting from that point and store its visited coordinates separately.\n5. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized to white (0).\n6. Fill the output grid:\n    - Mark coordinates visited by the azure path with azure (8).\n    - Mark coordinates visited by the green path with green (3). (Order ensures green takes precedence over azure if only visited by green).\n7. Identify coordinates visited by *both* paths (collisions).\n8. Change the color of these collision coordinates in the output grid to magenta (6). (Order ensures magenta takes precedence over azure/green).\n9.
