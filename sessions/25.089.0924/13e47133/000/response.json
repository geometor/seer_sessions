The shape and position of these Red lines are preserved exactly in the output grids.\n    *   The input grids have a dominant background color (Blue=1 in train\\_1, Yellow=4 in train\\_2).\n    *   Scattered within the input grids are other colored pixels (non-background, non-Red). These seem to act as \"seeds\" or \"sources\".\n    *   The output grids show areas filled with colors derived from these source pixels. The Red lines act as barriers to the filling process.\n    *   The grid appears to be divided into distinct regions by the Red lines and the grid edges.\n    *   Within each region, the filling seems to be based on the source pixels located within that region in the input grid.\n    *   The filling mechanism resembles a Voronoi diagram or a \"closest source\" fill. Each pixel within a region takes the color of the \"closest\" source pixel from the input, using Manhattan distance.\n    *   In case of ties (a pixel being equidistant from multiple source pixels), a tie-breaking rule seems to apply, likely based on the position of the source pixels (e.g., top-most, then left-most source wins).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Identify the background color by finding the most frequent color in the input grid, excluding the boundary color (Red).\n    3.  Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid. This preserves the Red boundaries and sets the initial state for regions without source pixels.\n    4.  Identify all distinct connected regions in the grid that do not contain the boundary color (Red). Use a method like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Flood Fill starting from non-Red pixels, treating Red pixels as impassable walls. Keep track of the coordinates belonging to each region.\n    5.  For each identified region:\n        a.  Find all \"source pixels\" within this region by examining the *input* grid. A source pixel is any pixel within the region's coordinates whose color is neither the background color nor the boundary color (Red). Store the coordinates and color of each source pixel found for this region.\n        b.  If one or more source pixels were found for the current region:\n            i.  Iterate through every pixel coordinate `(r, c)` belonging to this region.\n            ii. For the current pixel `(r, c)`, calculate the Manhattan distance (`|r - sr| + |c - sc|`) to every source pixel `(sr, sc)` associated with this region.\n            iii. Find the minimum Manhattan distance calculated.\n            iv. Identify all source pixels that are exactly at this minimum distance from `(r, c)`.\n            v.

If there are multiple source pixels at the minimum distance (a tie), select the one among them that has the smallest row index (`sr`). If there is still a tie (multiple sources at the minimum distance share the same smallest row index), select the one among those with the smallest column index (`sc`).\n            vii.Set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to the color of the selected source pixel.\n    6.
