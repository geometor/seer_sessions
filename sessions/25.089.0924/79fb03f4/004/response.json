            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code failed because it incorrectly identified which cells should be filled. It filled almost all cells reachable from the blue starting points, irrespective of their original color, as long as they weren't *also* starting points or explicit boundaries identified in the *first* pass. The fundamental error was assuming any cell not in the initial `visited` set (which contained all non-zero cells) must be a white cell eligible for filling. The correct approach requires explicitly checking if a neighbor cell is white (0) *before* filling it.\n\nThe analysis of all training examples confirms the pattern observed initially: a flood fill operation originating from blue (1) pixels, spreading through adjacent white (0) pixels, and being blocked by any non-white pixel or the grid boundaries. The fill color is always blue (1).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Refine the natural language program to explicitly state the condition for filling (must be white) and the boundary conditions (any non-white pixel or grid edge stops the fill).\n2.  Update the YAML facts to reflect this precise understanding.\n3.  The subsequent `coder` phase will implement this refined logic using a standard Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) flood fill algorithm, ensuring only white neighbors are considered for expansion.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
