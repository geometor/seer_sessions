The output grids are identical to the input grids, except that some white pixels have been changed to blue. The newly added blue pixels form contiguous regions that originate from the blue pixels present in the input grid. These regions expand outwards through adjacent white pixels until they are stopped by non-white pixels (azure or gray in the examples) or the grid boundaries. This suggests a \"flood fill\" or \"paint bucket\" operation. The non-white pixels (azure, gray) act as barriers or boundaries for the fill. The fill color is always blue (1), and it starts from the locations of the original blue (1) pixels in the input.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
