            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code implements a standard Breadth-First Search (BFS) flood fill algorithm. The intention is to start from all blue (1) pixels, fill adjacent white (0) pixels with blue (1), and stop the fill process at grid boundaries or any non-white pixels encountered (which act as barriers).\n\nHowever, the execution results show that the transformation failed for all examples. The transformed outputs consistently fill *all* originally white pixels with blue, irrespective of their connectivity to the initial blue starting pixels or the presence of barriers (gray 5, azure 8). The barrier pixels themselves (5 and 8) correctly remain unchanged, but they fail to stop the flood fill spreading across the rest of the grid.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests either:\n1.  A subtle bug in the provided code's implementation of the boundary check or visited set logic that wasn't apparent in the initial analysis.\n2.  An issue in the execution environment or testing harness that ran the code.\n3.  A misunderstanding of the fill rule (though the current interpretation seems consistent with the examples).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-affirm the flood fill logic based on visual inspection of the examples.\n2.  Assume the provided Python code's logic *is* the intended one, as it directly reflects the natural language program and visual analysis (BFS from blue '1's into white '0's, stopping at non-'0's).\n3.  Re-generate the YAML and Natural Language program based on this assumed correct logic. The subsequent coding phase will need to ensure the implementation rigorously follows this logic, paying close attention to boundary conditions and visited checks.\n4.  Gather metrics to confirm basic properties.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
