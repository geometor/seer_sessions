Filter these objects to retain only those that are located entirely inside the calculated bounding box.\n4.  Determine the color of the largest object (by pixel count) among the filtered, contained objects. This is the \"fill color\".\n5.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n6.

If a pixel's corresponding location in the input grid was white (0), change its color in the output grid to the determined \"fill color\".\n8.
