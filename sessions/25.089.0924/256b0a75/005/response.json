Identify the minimum bounding box enclosing all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  Find all contiguous objects within the input grid (using 4-way connectivity) whose color is neither white (0) nor azure (8).\n3.  Filter these objects to retain only those that are located entirely inside or on the boundary of the calculated bounding box.\n4.  Among the filtered, contained objects, determine the color ('fill_color') of the object with the largest size (pixel count). If there's a tie in size, choose the object with the numerically lowest color value.\n5.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n6.  Iterate through all pixels within the bounding box (inclusive).\n7.  If a pixel's corresponding location in the *input* grid was white (0), change its color in the *output* grid to the determined 'fill_color'.\n8.  Pixels outside the bounding box, the azure (8) boundary pixels themselves, and any non-white pixels originally inside the bounding box remain unchanged.\n9.  If no azure pixels are found, or if no non-white/non-azure objects are found fully contained within the bounding box, return the original grid unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid, ignore_colors=None, connectivity=4):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of the same color in a grid using BFS.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        ignore_colors (set, optional): A set of color values to ignore.
