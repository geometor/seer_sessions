The identification of the largest *contained* object (ignoring white/0 and azure/8) correctly determines the *fill color* required for the expected output in all three examples (blue/1, orange/7, green/3).\n3.  The original code failed because it simply replaced white pixels within the box, rather than performing a fill operation that propagates from existing internal non-white/non-azure pixels.\n4.  The `seed_pixels_inside_box` identified by the metric gathering code are the pixels belonging to the largest contained object. Wait, let me re-read the code I wrote for metrics. Ah, I iterated through *all* contained objects and added their coords to `seed_pixels`. Let me fix that to only include pixels from *all* non-white/non-azure objects inside the box.\n"

It also identifies the *exact* non-white/non-azure pixels located within the bounding box (inclusive). These pixels match the objects identified previously. These will be the \"seeds\" for the flood fill.\n\n*   **Example 1 Seeds:** `[(4, 10), (4, 11), (5, 10)]` - These are the blue pixels.\n*   **Example 2 Seeds:** `[(13, 9), (14, 9), (14, 10)]` - These are the orange pixels. Wait, what about the blue pixel at (17, 13)? Let me recheck the input and box. Box for Ex2 is rows 7-14, cols 9-14. Pixel (17, 13) is *outside* this box. My mistake in earlier analysis. The expected output also shows that pixel (17,13) is *not* part of the fill. Okay, so the seeds are correct.\n*   **Example 3 Seeds:** `[(14, 13), (15, 12), (15, 13)]` - These are the green pixels. What about blue(1) at (18,12), maroon(9) at (20,11), blue(1) at (22,8)? Box for Ex3 is rows 6-15, cols 6-13. Pixel (18,12) is outside. Pixel (20,11) is outside. Pixel (22,8) is outside. Okay, seeds are correct.\n\n**Conclusion:** The failure was purely in the fill mechanism. The logic for identifying the bounding box and the fill color was correct. The fill should be a flood fill starting from all non-white/non-azure pixels within the bounding box, propagating only through white pixels within the same bounding box, using the color of the largest fully contained object.\n\n---\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the bounding box defined by azure (8) pixels and successfully determined the required fill color by finding the largest non-white/non-azure object fully contained within that box. However, the code failed because it implemented a simple replacement of white pixels within the box instead of the required flood fill mechanism. The correct approach involves initiating a flood fill from all non-white, non-azure pixels located within the bounding box, using the determined fill color, and propagating this fill only through white pixels that are also within the bounding box.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If none are found, return the copied grid.\n3.  Calculate the minimum bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) that encloses all azure (8) pixels.\n4.  Find all contiguous objects within the input grid that are neither white (0) nor azure (8).\n5.  Filter these objects, keeping only those where *all* their pixels fall within the calculated bounding box (inclusive).\n6.  If there are any contained objects, determine the `fill_color` by selecting the color of the object with the largest pixel count (if sizes are equal, the specific object chosen doesn't matter based on examples). If there are no contained objects, return the copied grid.\n7.  Identify all \"seed pixels\": these are the coordinates (r, c) within the bounding box (inclusive, i.e., `min_r <= r <= max_r` and `min_c <= c <= max_c`) where the input grid color is neither white (0) nor azure (8).\n8.  If no seed pixels are found, return the copied grid.\n9.  Perform a flood fill operation on the output grid:\n    *   Initialize a queue with all seed pixel coordinates.\n    *   Maintain a set of visited coordinates for the flood fill to avoid cycles, initially containing the seed pixels.\n    *   While the queue is not empty:\n        *   Dequeue a coordinate (r, c). The pixel at (r,c) in the output grid should already have its original (non-white/non-azure) color.\n        *   Check its four neighbors (nr, nc): up, down, left, right.\n        *   For each neighbor (nr, nc):\n            *   Check if it's within the grid bounds.\n            *   Check if it's within the bounding box (`min_r <= nr <= max_r` and `min_c <= nc <= max_c`).\n            *   Check if the *original* color in the input grid at (nr, nc) was white (0).\n            *   Check if the coordinate (nr, nc) has not been visited *by the flood fill yet*.\n            *   If all checks pass:\n                *   Change the color of the pixel at (nr, nc) in the *output grid* to the `fill_color`.\n                *   Mark (nr, nc) as visited for the flood fill.\n                *   Enqueue (nr, nc).\n10.
