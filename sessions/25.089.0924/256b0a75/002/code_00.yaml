task_elements:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels (0-9).
  - type: background
    color_name: white
    color_value: 0
    description: The default background color, subject to filling.
  - type: boundary_object
    color_name: azure
    color_value: 8
    description: Pixels defining the boundary of the fill region. These pixels are preserved.
  - type: internal_objects
    description: Contiguous blocks of pixels of a single color (not white/0 and not azure/8) found within the boundary region.
    role: Determine fill color and act as starting points (seeds) for the fill.
  - type: bounding_box
    definition: The smallest rectangle enclosing all azure (8) pixels (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
    role: Defines the spatial extent for identifying contained objects and constraining the fill operation.
  - type: fill_color
    determination:
      - Find all contiguous objects (not white/0, not azure/8).
      - Filter for objects completely inside the bounding_box.
      - Identify the object with the largest pixel count among the filtered set (break ties by lowest color value, although not strictly necessary based on examples).
      - The color of this largest object is the fill_color.
    role: The color used for the flood fill operation.
  - type: seed_pixels
    definition: All pixels within the bounding_box (inclusive) whose color is neither white (0) nor azure (8).
    role: Starting points for the flood fill.
transformation:
  - action: identify_boundary
    input: input_grid
    color: azure (8)
    output: set of coordinates for all azure pixels
  - action: calculate_bounding_box
    input: set of coordinates for azure pixels
    output: coordinates defining the minimum bounding rectangle (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)
  - action: identify_contained_objects
    input: input_grid, bounding_box
    criteria:
      - Must not be white (0) or azure (8).
      - All pixels of the object must be within the bounding_box (r in [min_r, max_r], c in [min_c, max_c]).
    output: list of contained objects (color, size, location)
  - action: determine_fill_color
    input: list of contained objects
    method: Find the object with the maximum size.
    output: color of the largest contained object. Returns None if no contained objects.
  - action: identify_seed_pixels
    input: input_grid, bounding_box
    criteria: All pixels (r, c) such that min_r <= r <= max_r and min_c <= c <= max_c, and grid[r, c] is not white (0) and not azure (8).
    output: list of coordinates for seed pixels.
  - action: apply_flood_fill
    target: copy of input_grid
    region: within the bounding_box (r in [min_r, max_r], c in [min_c, max_c])
    seeds: seed_pixels
    fill_color: determined fill_color
    condition: Only fill pixels whose original color is white (0). Do not overwrite azure (8) or other non-white pixels.
    propagation: 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right).
    output: output_grid. If no fill_color determined or no seed_pixels found, return the copy of the input grid.
