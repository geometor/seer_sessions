**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code attempted a flood-fill approach, starting from non-white/non-azure "seed" pixels within the bounding box defined by azure (8) pixels. The test results show this is incorrect, as the fill color does not propagate to all white (0) pixels within the box as expected in the target outputs.

Comparing the inputs and expected outputs again strongly suggests a simpler mechanism:
1.  Identify the bounding box of all azure (8) pixels.
2.  Determine the "fill color" by finding the largest contiguous object (by pixel count, excluding white=0 and azure=8) that is located *entirely inside* this bounding box.
3.  Create the output grid by iterating through the input grid. For every pixel *within* the bounding box coordinates (inclusive), if its color in the input is white (0), change it to the determined fill color in the output. All other pixels (outside the box, azure pixels, non-white pixels inside the box) retain their original color.

The strategy is to revert to this simpler replacement logic, ensuring the identification of the correct fill color and the correct application region (within the bounding box).

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:** Bounding box is Rows 4-11, Cols 10-16. The largest (and only) contained object has color blue (1) and size 3. Fill color is blue (1). *Correction: My manual check missed one blue pixel at (5,10) was connected to (4,10) and (4,11) via 4-connectivity if we ignore the other pixel colors during search, or it's a separate object. Let's assume the `find_objects` uses 4-connectivity and treats each colored pixel independently. Input (4,10)=1, (4,11)=1, (5,10)=1. Yes, they are connected. Size is 3. The code output is correct.*
*   **Example 2:** Bounding box is Rows 7-14, Cols 9-14. The largest (and only) contained object has color orange (7) and size 3. Fill color is orange (7).
*   **Example 3:** Bounding box is Rows 6-15, Cols 6-13. The largest contained object has color green (3) and size 3. Fill color is green (3). *Correction: Input has (14,13)=3, (15,12)=3, (15,13)=3. These form one object of size 3. The code output is correct.*

The metric analysis confirms the bounding boxes and the fill colors derived from the largest contained objects. The core issue was the application method (failed flood fill vs. direct replacement).

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels (0-9 colors).
  - type: background
    color_name: white
    color_value: 0
    description: The default background color.
  - type: boundary_object
    color_name: azure
    color_value: 8
    description: Contiguous or non-contiguous pixels of this color define the boundary area.
  - type: contained_objects
    description: Contiguous blocks of pixels of a single color (not white/0 and not azure/8) found within the boundary region. Must use 4-connectivity for object identification.

    description: The minimum bounding rectangle enclosing all azure (8) pixels (inclusive coordinates).
    role: Defines the area for the fill operation.
  - type: fill_color
    determination:
      - Find all contiguous objects (using 4-connectivity) with colors other than white (0) or azure (8).
      - Filter these objects to keep only those whose coordinates are *all* within the bounding_box (inclusive).
      - Among the filtered objects, identify the object with the largest pixel count (size). If there's a tie in size, choose the object with the numerically lowest color value.
      - The color of this selected object is the fill_color.
    role: The color used to replace background pixels within the bounding box.
transformation:
  - action: identify_boundary_pixels

    color: azure (8)
    output: list of coordinates [(r1, c1), (r2, c2), ...] for all azure pixels.
  - action: calculate_bounding_box
    input: list of azure pixel coordinates
    condition: Must contain at least one azure pixel.
    output: coordinates defining the minimum bounding rectangle (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col). If no azure pixels, no transformation occurs.
  - action: find_all_objects
    input: input_grid
    ignore_colors: [white (0), azure (8)]
    connectivity: 4
    output: list of objects, each with {color, size, coords}.
  - action: filter_contained_objects
    input: list of objects, bounding_box
    criteria: All coordinates of an object must be within or on the bounding_box edges.
    output: list of fully contained objects.
  - action: determine_fill_color
    input: list of contained objects
    condition: List must not be empty.
    method: Find object with max size. If tie, use min color value among max-sized objects.
    output: fill_color. If no contained objects, no transformation occurs.
  - action: apply_fill_replacement
    target: input_grid (to create output_grid)
    region: All pixels (r, c) such that min_row <= r <= max_row and min_col <= c <= max_col.
    condition: The pixel at (r, c) in the *input_grid* must be white (0).
    replacement: Change the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the *output_grid* to fill_color.
    preservation: All pixels outside the bounding box, all azure (8) pixels, and all non-white pixels inside the bounding box retain their original color from the input_grid.
    output: output_grid. If no azure pixels or no contained objects found, output_grid is identical to input_grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Find the coordinates of all pixels in the input grid with the color azure (8).
3.  If no azure (8) pixels are found, return the unmodified output grid (which is a copy of the input).
4.  Calculate the minimum bounding box (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column) that encloses all the found azure (8) pixels.
5.  Find all contiguous objects in the input grid using 4-way connectivity, ignoring white (0) and azure (8) pixels. Record each object's color, size (pixel count), and coordinates.
6.  Filter this list of objects, keeping only those where *all* of the object's coordinates fall within the calculated bounding box (inclusive).
7.  If no objects are fully contained within the bounding box, return the unmodified output grid.
8.  From the list of fully contained objects, select the object with the largest size. If there is a tie for the largest size, select the object with the smallest numerical color value among those tied.
9.  Identify the color of the selected object; this is the "fill color".
10. Iterate through all pixel coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) within the bounding box (from minimum row to maximum row, and minimum column to maximum column, inclusive).
11. For each coordinate (r, c) inside the bounding box, check the color of the corresponding pixel in the *input* grid.
12. If the input grid pixel at (r, c) is white (0), change the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the *output* grid to the determined "fill color".
13. Return the final output grid.
