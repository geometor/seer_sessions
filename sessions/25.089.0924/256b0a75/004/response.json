            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code attempted a flood-fill approach, starting from non-white/non-azure \"seed\" pixels within the bounding box defined by azure (8) pixels. The test results show this is incorrect, as the fill color does not propagate to all white (0) pixels within the box as expected in the target outputs.\n\nComparing the inputs and expected outputs again strongly suggests a simpler mechanism:\n1.  Identify the bounding box of all azure (8) pixels.\n2.  Determine the \"fill color\" by finding the largest contiguous object (by pixel count, excluding white=0 and azure=8) that is located *entirely inside* this bounding box.\n3.  Create the output grid by iterating through the input grid. For every pixel *within* the bounding box coordinates (inclusive), if its color in the input is white (0), change it to the determined fill color in the output. All other pixels (outside the box, azure pixels, non-white pixels inside the box) retain their original color.\n\nThe strategy is to revert to this simpler replacement logic, ensuring the identification of the correct fill color and the correct application region (within the bounding box).\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
