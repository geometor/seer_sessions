This structure often forms a hollow rectangle or frame-like shape, though it might not be perfectly rectangular itself (e.g., the 'U' shape in train_1).\n4.  **Other Objects:** Various other colored pixels exist, sometimes forming small contiguous objects of a single color.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying a rectangular region associated with the azure (8) pixels and modifying the background pixels within that region.\n6.  **Region Identification:** The region appears to be the bounding box encompassing all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.\n7.  **Fill Operation:** White (0) pixels strictly *inside* this bounding box are replaced with a specific \"fill color\" in the output.\n8.  **Fill Color Determination:** The fill color is derived from the input grid. It seems to be the color of the largest contiguous object (measured by pixel count) that is composed of a single color (other than white/0 and azure/8) and is located entirely *within* the bounding box defined by the azure pixels.\n9.  **Preservation:** Pixels outside the bounding box, the azure boundary pixels themselves, and any non-white pixels originally inside the bounding box remain unchanged in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Determine the minimum bounding box that encloses all identified azure (8) pixels. Let this box be defined by minimum row `min_r`, maximum row `max_r`, minimum column `min_c`, and maximum column `max_c`.\n4.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects in the input grid whose color is neither white (0) nor azure (8).\n5.  Filter these objects, keeping only those that are located entirely within the bounds of the bounding box (i.e., all pixels of the object must have row coordinates between `min_r` and `max_r` inclusive, and column coordinates between `min_c` and `max_c` inclusive).\n6.  Among the filtered objects, find the object(s) with the largest area (highest pixel count). If there's a tie, any one of the largest objects can be chosen (the examples suggest a unique largest object).\n7.  Determine the color of this largest, fully contained object. This color is the \"fill color\".\n8.  Iterate through each pixel within the bounding box (from row `min_r` to `max_r`, and column `min_c` to `max_c`).\n9.  For each pixel within this bounding box, check if its color in the input grid is white (0).\n10. If the pixel's color is white (0), change its color in the output grid to the determined \"fill color\".\n11. Pixels outside the bounding box, pixels that were originally azure (8), and non-white pixels that were inside the bounding box retain their original colors in the output grid.\n12. Return the modified output grid."
