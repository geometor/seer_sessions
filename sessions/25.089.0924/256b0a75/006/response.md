**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code failed because the transformation rule was incorrectly deduced, likely by overfitting to the first example or misinterpreting the fill mechanism. The core error was assuming the fill operation was strictly confined *within* the bounding box defined by the azure (8) pixels. The results clearly show that the fill color propagates *outside* this bounding box into adjacent white areas, stopping only when encountering non-white pixels (including the azure boundary itself) or the grid edges.

The strategy is to refine the understanding based on this new observation:
1.  Confirm the method for determining the `fill_color` remains correct (largest object fully contained within the azure bounding box, using the lowest color value as a tie-breaker).
2.  Redefine the fill mechanism as a flood fill operation. This flood fill uses the determined `fill_color`, starts from *all* white pixels initially located *inside* the azure bounding box, and propagates outwards in 4 directions into any adjacent white pixel, regardless of whether that pixel is inside or outside the original bounding box. The propagation is blocked by any non-white pixel (including the original azure pixels and other colored objects).
