Identify the minimum bounding box enclosing all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  Find all contiguous objects (using 4-way connectivity) within the input grid whose color is neither white (0) nor azure (8).\n3.  Filter these objects to retain only those located entirely inside the calculated bounding box.\n4.  Among the filtered, contained objects, determine the color ('fill_color') of the object with the largest size (pixel count). If there's a tie in size, choose the object with the numerically lowest color value.\n5.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n6.  Identify all 'seed' pixels: pixels within the bounding box (inclusive) whose color in the *input* grid is white (0).\n7.  Perform a flood fill operation starting from these seed pixels:\n    a. Use the determined 'fill_color'.\n    b. The fill propagates in 4 directions (up, down, left, right).\n    c. Propagation only occurs into pixels whose color in the *input* grid is white (0).\n    d. The fill is not constrained by the bounding box itself, only by non-white pixels in the input grid or grid boundaries.\n8.  Pixels that were not white (0) in the input grid retain their original colors.\n9.  If no azure (8) pixels are found, or if no non-white/non-azure objects are fully contained within the bounding box, or if no white 'seed' pixels are found within the bounding box, return the original grid unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid, ignore_colors=None, connectivity=4):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of the same color in a grid using BFS.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        ignore_colors (set, optional): A set of color values to ignore.
