            "text": "*   **Perception:**\n    The task involves transforming an input grid based on the interaction between gray lines and another single color. Each input grid contains a background of white (0), prominent horizontal and vertical lines of gray (5) pixels, and scattered pixels of a single other color (green (3) in example 1, red (2) in example 2, yellow (4) in example 3). The output grid retains the gray lines but replaces the scattered colored pixels with white (0). Crucially, the points where the horizontal and vertical gray lines intersected in the input grid are changed to the specific color that was scattered in the input grid.\n\n*   **YAML:**\n    "

Check if this gray pixel belongs to both a fully gray horizontal line and a fully gray vertical line within the input grid (i.e., it's an intersection point).\n        b.  If it is an intersection point, set the corresponding cell in the new grid to the `target_color`.\n        c.
