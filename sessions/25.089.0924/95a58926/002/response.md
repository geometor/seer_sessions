## General Assessment

The initial code failed because the definition of "structural lines" (rows and columns) was incorrect. The assumption was that these lines must consist *only* of gray (5) and the target color, and that other pixels (like white 0) would disqualify a line. However, analyzing the input/output pairs reveals a different pattern:

1.  A specific `target_color` exists in each input, differing from white (0) and gray (5).
2.  Rows and columns in the *input* grid that consist *entirely* of gray (5) pixels and potentially the `target_color` pixels define the structure of the *output* grid. Let's call these "qualifying lines".
3.  The output grid is constructed by first drawing gray lines corresponding to *all* qualifying rows and columns.
4.  The points where these qualifying rows and columns intersect are then colored with the `target_color`.
5.  All other pixels in the output grid are white (0). Specifically, any `target_color` pixels from the input that are *not* at these intersection points are removed (changed to white).

The strategy is to refine the identification of these qualifying lines based on the condition that they contain *only* gray (5) and the `target_color`, and no other colors (like white 0). Then, reconstruct the output grid using these lines and their intersections.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's re-examine the examples using the revised understanding of qualifying lines.
