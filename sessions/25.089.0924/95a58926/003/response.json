Identify the unique color ('target_color') present in the input grid that is neither white (0) nor gray (5).\n2. Identify 'qualifying rows': rows in the input grid that consist *exclusively* of gray (5) pixels and/or the target_color pixels. No other colors (like white 0) are allowed in these rows.\n3. Identify 'qualifying columns': columns in the input grid that consist *exclusively* of gray (5) pixels and/or the target_color pixels. No other colors (like white 0) are allowed in these columns.\n4. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with white (0).\n5. For each identified 'qualifying row' index `r`, set all pixels in the corresponding row `r` of the output grid to gray (5).\n6. For each identified 'qualifying column' index `c`, set all pixels in the corresponding column `c` of the output grid to gray (5). Note that pixels at intersections will be overwritten with gray.\n7. For every intersection point defined by a 'qualifying row' index `r` and a 'qualifying column' index `c`, set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to the `target_color`. This specifically colors the intersection points, overwriting the gray pixels placed in steps 5 and 6.\n8.
