Input:
  Grid:
    - Size: Variable (e.g., 23x24 in train_1)
    - Background: Can vary (azure=8 in train_1 example area)
    - Objects:
      - Frame:
        - Color: Gray (5)
        - Shape: Rectangle
        - Role: Defines the area of interest.
      - Content_Objects (inside frame):
        - Type: Small (e.g., 3x3) blocks containing specific key colors (Green=3, Blue=1 in train_1) potentially mixed with the background color (Azure=8).
        - Arrangement: Placed at various locations within the frame on the background color.
      - External_Objects (outside frame):
        - Type: Various shapes and colors.
        - Role: Ignored in the transformation.
      - Content_Background:
        - Color: The dominant color inside the frame (Azure=8 in train_1).
Output:
  Grid:
    - Size: Determined by the dimensions of the input gray frame.
    - Objects:
      - Frame:
        - Color: Gray (5)
        - Shape: Rectangle (copied from input frame).
      - Content_Patterns (inside frame):
        - Type: Fixed patterns (e.g., 3x3) corresponding to input Content_Objects.
        - Color: Determined by the color of the corresponding input Content_Object (e.g., Red=2 or Yellow=4 in train_1).
        - Pattern Structure: Specific arrangement of pixels, may include the background color.
          - Red Pattern (train_1): [[2, 8, 2], [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2]]
          - Yellow Pattern (train_1): [[4, 8, 4], [4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4]]
      - Content_Background:
        - Color: Copied from the input Content_Background (Azure=8 in train_1).
Transformation:
  Action: Pattern Substitution within a Frame.
  Steps:
    1. Identify the bounding box of the gray (5) frame in the input.
    2. Determine the output grid size from the frame's bounding box dimensions.
    3. Copy the gray (5) frame to the output grid.
    4. Identify the background color within the input frame.
    5. Fill the area inside the output frame with this background color.
    6. Define the size (e.g., 3x3) of the key input objects/output patterns.
    7. Define the mapping rules (input color -> output pattern).
    8. Scan the area inside the input frame for key objects (e.g., 3x3 blocks containing Green=3 or Blue=1).
    9. For each key object found at a specific location:
       - Apply the mapping rule to get the corresponding output pattern.
       - Place the output pattern at the same relative location inside the output frame, overwriting the background.
Relationships:
  - The output grid size is determined by the input gray frame size.
  - The output frame is a direct copy of the input frame.
  - The output background color is copied from the input background color *inside* the frame.
  - Each key object inside the input frame maps to a specific fixed pattern in the output frame based on the key object's color.
  - The relative positions of the mapped patterns in the output correspond to the relative positions of the key objects in the input.
  - Objects outside the input frame are irrelevant.
