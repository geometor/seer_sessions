"""
Identifies nested rectangular layers of colors in the input grid by calculating the bounding box area for each color. 
The colors are assumed to form nested layers, ordered from the smallest bounding box area (innermost) to the largest (outermost).
Constructs a square output grid whose size is determined by the number of layers (N), with dimensions (2N-1)x(2N-1).
The output grid displays these colors as concentric square frames, mirroring the inferred nesting order. 
The color with the smallest bounding box area forms the 1x1 center of the output, the next smallest forms the surrounding 3x3 frame, and so on, up to the color with the largest bounding box area forming the outermost frame.
