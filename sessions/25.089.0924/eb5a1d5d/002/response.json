            "text": "*   **Assessment:**\n    *   The initial code correctly identified the core transformation: representing nested rectangular color layers as concentric squares in the output.\n    *   The code successfully processed Example 1, where the layer detection logic (tracing horizontally from the center) happened to work.\n    *   The code failed on Examples 2 and 3 because the layer detection logic was flawed. It missed the innermost color layers (red in Ex2, blue in Ex3) because the simple horizontal trace from the exact center row didn't encounter those colors first.\n    *   The output construction logic (building concentric squares based on the detected layers) appears correct, but it produced incorrect outputs due to the incorrect layer sequence input.\n*   **Strategy:**\n    *   The primary task is to revise the layer detection mechanism (`_get_color_layers`) to be robust against variations in the exact shape and position of the innermost layers relative to the grid center.\n    *   A more reliable method is to start at the geometric center of the input grid and expand outwards, recording each new color encountered. This ensures that layers are captured in the correct order, from innermost to outermost, regardless of minor asymmetries.\n    *   The revised approach will involve:\n        1.  Calculating the center coordinates.\n        2.  Getting the color of the center pixel as the first layer.\n        3.  Iteratively checking pixels at increasing distances (e.g., Manhattan or Chebyshev distance) from the center.\n        4.  Adding a new color to the layer list only when a pixel with a color different from the *most recently added* layer color is found.\n        5.  Stopping when the grid boundaries are reached or no new colors are found upon further expansion.\n    *   The rest of the transformation logic (calculating output size `2N-1` and filling concentric squares) can likely remain the same, using the correctly identified layers.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    "
