"""
Identifies nested rectangular layers of colors in the input grid, starting from the center outwards.
Constructs a square output grid whose size is determined by the number of layers (N), with dimensions (2N-1)x(2N-1).
The output grid displays these colors as concentric square frames, mirroring the nesting order from the input. 
The innermost input color forms the 1x1 center of the output, the next color forms the surrounding 3x3 frame, and so on, up to the outermost color forming the largest frame.
