If an object has an odd number of frames, the middle frame's color remains unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Preserved in output.\n          - location: Position within the grid. Preserved in output.\n          - background_color: white (0)\n    Actions:\n      - Identify Objects: Locate contiguous non-background color regions forming nested frames.\n      - Extract Color Sequence: For each object, determine the ordered list of colors from the outermost frame to the innermost frame.\n      - Reverse Color Sequence: Reverse the order of the extracted color list.\n      - Apply Reversed Colors: Re-color the frames of the object in the output grid using the reversed color sequence, maintaining the original frame structure and position. The original outermost frame gets the color of the original innermost frame, the original second outermost gets the color of the original second innermost, etc.\n    Relationships:\n      - Frame Mapping: There is a one-to-one mapping between the input frames and output frames based on their layer position (1st layer maps to Nth layer, 2nd layer maps to (N-1)th layer, ..., Nth layer maps to 1st layer, where N is the total number of frames).\n      - Color Transformation: The color of an output frame at layer 'i' (from outside) is determined by the color of the input frame at layer 'N - i + 1'.\n    ```"

An object is a structure composed of nested, concentric frames of solid colors, surrounded by the background color (white, 0).\n    2.  For each identified object:\n        a.  Determine the sequence of colors of its frames, starting from the outermost frame and moving inwards to the innermost frame. Let this sequence be `C = [c1, c2, ..., cn]`, where `c1` is the outermost color and `cn` is the innermost color.\n        b.  Create a reversed sequence of these colors: `C_reversed = [cn, c(n-1), ..., c1]`.\n        c.  Generate the output object by keeping the original shape, size, and position of the frames, but assign the colors from the `C_reversed` sequence. The outermost frame (originally color `c1`) will now have color `cn`, the second outermost frame (originally color `c2`) will now have color `c(n-1)`, and so on, until the innermost frame (originally color `cn`) receives color `c1`.\n    3.  Combine the transformed objects onto a background grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0), to create the final output grid."
