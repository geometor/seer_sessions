    *   The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, preserving the original blue pixels and the red 2x2 squares.
    *   The key transformation is the addition of new blue pixels in the output grid.
    *   These new blue pixels are always located in positions that were originally white in the input grid.
    *   The placement of the new blue pixels is determined by their relationship to the red 2x2 squares. Specifically, a white pixel changes to blue if and only if it is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to exactly two red pixels.
