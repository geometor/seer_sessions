"""
Transforms an input grid based on identifying the largest contiguous non-background object and specific single-pixel 'anchor' objects.

1.  Determine the background color (most frequent pixel color).
2.  Find all contiguous objects (connected orthogonally or diagonally) of non-background colors.
3.  If no non-background objects exist, return a grid filled with the background color.
4.  Identify the object with the largest number of pixels. Its color is the 'shape_color', and its pixel locations are recorded.
5.  Identify all single-pixel objects whose color is neither the background color nor the 'shape_color'. These are 'anchor points'. Their color is the 'anchor_color', and their locations are recorded.
6.  Create an output grid filled with the background color.
7.  Copy the largest object onto the output grid using its original 'shape_color' and locations.
8.  For each anchor point's location (r, c), draw a 3x3 cross pattern overlaid on the output grid:
    - Center pixel (r, c) gets the 'anchor_color'.
    - Orthogonally adjacent pixels (r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1) get the 'shape_color', respecting grid boundaries. These overwrite any existing pixel (background or largest object).
