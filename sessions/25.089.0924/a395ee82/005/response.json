Finding all contiguous non-background objects (8-way connectivity).\n3. Determining the color ('shape_color') of the largest object (by pixel count).\n4. Identifying single-pixel 'anchor' objects whose color is different from both the background and shape_color. The color of these anchors is 'anchor_color'.\n5. Creating a new grid filled with the background color.\n6. For each anchor point location, drawing a cross pattern: the center pixel gets the anchor_color, and the four orthogonal neighbors get the shape_color (respecting grid boundaries).\nIf no non-background objects or no anchor points are found, the output is a grid filled with the background color.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid, background_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of non-background colors in the grid.\n    Connectivity includes orthogonal and diagonal neighbors (8-way).\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        background_color (int): The color to ignore (background).\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an object\n              with keys 'color', 'locations' (list of (row, col) tuples),\n              and 'size'.
