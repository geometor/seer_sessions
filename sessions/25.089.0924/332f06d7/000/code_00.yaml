Task: Conditional Color Transformation

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9).
  - Colors:
      - Active: Red (2), White (0), Blue (1)
      - Background: Green (3) (and potentially others, though only Green appears here)
  - Objects: Contiguous blocks of a single active color (Red, White, or Blue).
  - Object_Counts: The number of distinct, isolated objects found for each active color.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Transformed 2D array of pixels.

Transformation:
  - Type: Pixel-wise color substitution based on a global condition.
  - Condition: Check if the number of distinct Red objects = 1 AND the number of distinct White objects = 1 AND the number of distinct Blue objects = 1.
  - Rules:
      - If Condition is True:
          - Red (2) -> Red (2)
          - White (0) -> Blue (1)
          - Blue (1) -> White (0)
          - Other_Colors -> Other_Colors (e.g., Green (3) -> Green (3))
      - If Condition is False:
          - Red (2) -> White (0)
          - White (0) -> Blue (1)
          - Blue (1) -> Blue (1)
          - Other_Colors -> Other_Colors (e.g., Green (3) -> Green (3))
  - Scope: Applies to all pixels in the grid.
