            "text": "12. **Analyze Metrics and Refine:**\n    *   The code execution confirms that `find_objects` (using 8-connectivity) finds exactly one Red, one White, and one Blue object in *all four* input examples.\n    *   This means the condition `(num_red == 1 and num_white == 1 and num_blue == 1)` is TRUE for *all* examples.\n    *   However, the required rule sets are:\n        *   Ex 1: RuleSetFalse (R->W, W->B, B->B)\n        *   Ex 2: RuleSetTrue (W->B, B->W, R->R)\n        *   Ex 3: RuleSetTrue (W->B, B->W, R->R)\n        *   Ex 4: RuleSetFalse (R->W, W->B, B->B)\n    *   The condition `(R=1, W=1, B=1)` does *not* correctly distinguish between the cases needing RuleSetTrue vs RuleSetFalse.\n    *   We need a *different* condition. What distinguishes Example 1 & 4 (RuleSetFalse) from Example 2 & 3 (RuleSetTrue)? All have (1,1,1) objects.\n    *   Let's re-examine the grids visually.\n        *   Ex 1 & 4 have relatively small, simple objects. The Blue object in Ex 1 is complex but disconnected parts. The Blue object in Ex 4 is also complex and spread out (but apparently connected by the labeler).\n        *   Ex 2 & 3 have larger, more 'solid' or contiguous-looking objects, especially the Blue ones.\n    *   Is it about the size or shape of the objects?\n        *   Ex 1: R(2x2), W(2x2), B(complex, multi-part?)\n        *   Ex 2: R(2x2), W(2x2), B(large L-shape + line)\n        *   Ex 3: R(3x3), W(3x3), B(very complex, large)\n        *   Ex 4: R(1x1), W(1x1), B(spread out, complex)\n\n    *   What if the condition relates to the *relative positions* or *adjacency* of the Red, White, and Blue objects?\n        *   **Ex 1 (False Rule):** Red (top left) is near Blue (top left). White (bottom right) is far.\n        *   **Ex 2 (True Rule):** Red (bottom left) is far from White (top right) and Blue (center/left). White is near Blue.\n        *   **Ex 3 (True Rule):** Red (top left) is near Blue. White (bottom left) is near Blue. Red and White are far.\n        *   **Ex 4 (False Rule):** Red (bottom center) is far. White (top left) is near Blue.\n\n    *   Let's define \"near\": Are any pixels of the two objects adjacent (including diagonals)?\n        *   **Ex 1 (False):** Red is adjacent to Blue (e.g., R(1,2) and B(2,1)). White is not adjacent to Red or Blue. (R adj B? Yes. W adj R? No. W adj B? No) -> False Rule\n        *   **Ex 2 (True):** Red is not adjacent to White or Blue. White is adjacent to Blue (e.g., W(3,11) and B(3,10)). (R adj B? No. W adj R? No. W adj B? Yes) -> True Rule\n        *   **Ex 3 (True):** Red is adjacent to Blue (e.g., R(3,2) and B(3,3)). White is adjacent to Blue (e.g., W(12,3) and B(11,3)). Red is not adjacent to White. (R adj B? Yes. W adj R? No. W adj B? Yes) -> True Rule\n        *   **Ex 4 (False):** Red is not adjacent to White or Blue. White is adjacent to Blue (e.g., W(1,1) and B(1,2)). (R adj B? No. W adj R? No. W adj B? Yes) -> False Rule\n\n    *   This adjacency pattern doesn't seem consistent.\n        *   False Rule: (R adj B = Y, W adj B = N) OR (R adj B = N, W adj B = Y)\n        *   True Rule: (R adj B = N, W adj B = Y) OR (R adj B = Y, W adj B = Y)\n        *   This doesn't work because (R adj B = N, W adj B = Y) leads to both True (Ex2) and False (Ex4).\n\n    *   **New Hypothesis:** Maybe the trigger isn't the count (1,1,1), but something else entirely, and the fact they were all (1,1,1) was a coincidence or red herring. What if the trigger is simply the presence of *any* Red pixel? No, all inputs have Red. What about the *location* of the Red pixel?\n        *   Ex 1 (False): Red top-left\n        *   Ex 2 (True): Red bottom-left\n        *   Ex 3 (True): Red top-left\n        *   Ex 4 (False): Red bottom-center\n\n    *   What if the condition is simpler: does any Red pixel touch (adjacency including diagonal) any White pixel?\n        *   Ex 1: No. -> False Rule\n        *   Ex 2: No. -> True Rule\n        *   Ex 3: No. -> True Rule\n        *   Ex 4: No. -> False Rule\n        *   This doesn't work.\n\n    *   Does any Red pixel touch any Blue pixel?\n        *   Ex 1: Yes (R(1,2) touches B(2,1)). -> False Rule\n        *   Ex 2: No. -> True Rule\n        *   Ex 3: Yes (R(1,2) touches B(1,3)). -> True Rule\n        *   Ex 4: No. -> False Rule\n        *   This doesn't work.\n\n    *   Does any White pixel touch any Blue pixel?\n        *   Ex 1: No. -> False Rule\n        *   Ex 2: Yes (W(2,10) touches B(2,9)). -> True Rule\n        *   Ex 3: Yes (W(12,3) touches B(11,3)). -> True Rule\n        *   Ex 4: Yes (W(1,1) touches B(1,2)). -> False Rule\n        *   This doesn't work.\n\n    *   Let's re-examine the rules:\n        *   RuleSetFalse: R->W, W->B, B->B (Applied in 1, 4)\n        *   RuleSetTrue: W->B, B->W, R->R (Applied in 2, 3)\n\n    *   What is common to 1 and 4? What is common to 2 and 3?\n    *   Maybe it's about the *number* of adjacencies?\n    *   Let's focus on the Red object. In Ex 1 & 4 (False Rule), the Red object is *not* adjacent to the White object. In Ex 2 & 3 (True Rule), the Red object is *not* adjacent to the White object. This doesn't help.\n    *   In Ex 1 & 4 (False Rule), the Red object IS adjacent to Blue (Ex 1) or NOT adjacent to Blue (Ex 4). No pattern.\n    *   In Ex 2 & 3 (True Rule), the Red object is NOT adjacent to Blue (Ex 2) or IS adjacent to Blue (Ex 3). No pattern.\n\n    *   Okay, let's step back. The initial code failed because it misidentified the condition. The metrics show *all* inputs have counts (1,1,1). The *actual* required rules split these (1,1,1) cases into two groups. What property splits {1, 4} from {2, 3}?\n\n    *   **Consider the White object:**\n        *   Ex 1 (False): White is NOT adjacent to Red or Blue.\n        *   Ex 4 (False): White IS adjacent to Blue, NOT adjacent to Red.\n        *   Ex 2 (True): White IS adjacent to Blue, NOT adjacent to Red.\n        *   Ex 3 (True): White IS adjacent to Blue, NOT adjacent to Red.\n\n    *   **Hypothesis:** The condition for RuleSetTrue (W->B, B->W, R->R) is: `num_red == 1 AND num_white == 1 AND num_blue == 1 AND WhiteObjectIsAdjacentToBlueObject`.\n        *   Ex 1: Counts=(1,1,1). W adj B? No. Condition = FALSE. -> Use RuleSetFalse. Matches expected.\n        *   Ex 2: Counts=(1,1,1). W adj B? Yes. Condition = TRUE. -> Use RuleSetTrue. Matches expected.\n        *   Ex 3: Counts=(1,1,1). W adj B? Yes. Condition = TRUE. -> Use RuleSetTrue. Matches expected.\n        *   Ex 4: Counts=(1,1,1). W adj B? Yes. Condition = TRUE. -> Use RuleSetTrue. DOES NOT MATCH expected (which is RuleSetFalse).\n\n    *   This is frustrating. Let's try again. What if the condition involves Red?\n    *   **Hypothesis:** The condition for RuleSetTrue is: `num_red == 1 AND num_white == 1 AND num_blue == 1 AND RedObjectIsAdjacentToBlueObject`.\n        *   Ex 1: Counts=(1,1,1). R adj B? Yes. Condition = TRUE. -> Use RuleSetTrue. DOES NOT MATCH expected (RuleSetFalse).\n        *   Ex 2: Counts=(1,1,1). R adj B? No. Condition = FALSE. -> Use RuleSetFalse. DOES NOT MATCH expected (RuleSetTrue).\n        *   Ex 3: Counts=(1,1,1). R adj B? Yes. Condition = TRUE. -> Use RuleSetTrue. Matches expected.\n        *   Ex 4: Counts=(1,1,1). R adj B? No. Condition = FALSE. -> Use RuleSetFalse. Matches expected.\n\n    *   This correctly identifies 3 out of 4. What's different about Ex 1 vs 3 (both R adj B)? What's different about Ex 2 vs 4 (both R not adj B)?\n\n    *   Let's reconsider the failed outputs from the first code attempt.\n        *   Ex1: Expected FalseRule, Got TrueRule.\n        *   Ex2: Expected TrueRule, Got TrueRule (but pixels wrong?) -> No, I misread the output earlier. My code produced the wrong pixels *because* it applied the TrueRule when it should have applied the FalseRule based on my later analysis? Let's re-check the expected outputs.\n            *   Ex1 Expected: R->W, W->B, B->B (FalseRule)\n            *   Ex2 Expected: W->B, B->W, R->R (TrueRule)\n            *   Ex3 Expected: W->B, B->W, R->R (TrueRule)\n            *   Ex4 Expected: R->W, W->B, B->B (FalseRule)\n        *   My code (which assumed condition `R=1,W=1,B=1` was the trigger for TrueRule) produced:\n            *   Ex1: TrueRule (because counts were 1,1,1) -> WRONG\n            *   Ex2: TrueRule (because counts were 1,1,1) -> CORRECT\n            *   Ex3: TrueRule (because counts were 1,1,1) -> CORRECT\n            *   Ex4: TrueRule (because counts were 1,1,1) -> WRONG\n\n        *   This confirms: The condition `(R=1, W=1, B=1)` is NOT the trigger. The trigger must distinguish {1, 4} (needs FalseRule) from {2, 3} (needs TrueRule).\n\n    *   What distinguishes {1, 4} from {2, 3}?\n        *   Let's use the adjacency results again:\n            *   Ex 1: R adj B: Yes. W adj B: No. R adj W: No. -> FalseRule\n            *   Ex 4: R adj B: No. W adj B: Yes. R adj W: No. -> FalseRule\n            *   Ex 2: R adj B: No. W adj B: Yes. R adj W: No. -> TrueRule\n            *   Ex 3: R adj B: Yes. W adj B: Yes. R adj W: No. -> TrueRule\n\n        *   **Hypothesis:** The condition for RuleSetTrue is: `W adj B AND (NOT (R adj B))` OR `(W adj B AND R adj B)`. This simplifies to `W adj B`. Let's test `W adj B`:\n            *   Ex 1: W adj B? No. -> FalseRule. Correct.\n            *   Ex 4: W adj B? Yes. -> TrueRule. Incorrect (Expected FalseRule).\n            *   Ex 2: W adj B? Yes. -> TrueRule. Correct.\n            *   Ex 3: W adj B? Yes. -> TrueRule. Correct.\n\n        *   Almost... why does Ex 4 need FalseRule even though W adj B?\n        *   What's unique about Ex 4? The Red object is 1x1. What about Ex 1? Red object is 2x2. Ex 2 is 2x2. Ex 3 is 3x3.\n        *   What if the Red object size matters?\n        *   **Hypothesis:** If W adj B, use TrueRule, *UNLESS* the Red object is 1x1, in which case use FalseRule.\n            *   Ex 1: W adj B? No. -> Use FalseRule. Correct.\n            *   Ex 4: W adj B? Yes. Red size=1x1? Yes. -> Use FalseRule. Correct.\n            *   Ex 2: W adj B? Yes. Red size=1x1? No (2x2). -> Use TrueRule. Correct.\n            *   Ex 3: W adj B? Yes. Red size=1x1? No (3x3). -> Use TrueRule. Correct.\n\n        *   This fits all examples! The condition needs to check adjacency and the size of the Red object.\n        *   The size check could be \"number of red pixels == 1\".\n\n13. **Final Logic:**\n    *   Find the Red, White, and Blue objects. (We know counts are always 1,1,1 for these examples, but the logic should be general).\n    *   Check if the White object is adjacent (sharing a side or corner) to the Blue object. Let this be `white_touches_blue`.\n    *   Count the number of Red pixels. Let this be `num_red_pixels`.\n    *   Determine the condition: `use_true_rule = white_touches_blue AND (num_red_pixels > 1)`.\n    *   If `use_true_rule` is TRUE: Apply W->B, B->W, R->R.\n    *   If `use_true_rule` is FALSE: Apply R->W, W->B, B->B.\n\n14. **Update YAML and Natural Language Program:** Incorporate the refined condition based on White-Blue adjacency and the number of Red pixels.**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the two potential transformation rules involving Red (2), White (0), and Blue (1) pixels, but incorrectly determined the condition that selects between them. The code execution metrics revealed that the initial hypothesis \u2013 that the condition was based solely on finding exactly one object of each color (Red=1, White=1, Blue=1) \u2013 was flawed, as this condition held true for all four examples, yet two distinct rulesets were required.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the condition by identifying a property that distinguishes examples 1 & 4 (which require RuleSetFalse: R->W, W->B, B->B) from examples 2 & 3 (which require RuleSetTrue: W->B, B->W, R->R). Analysis suggests this distinguishing property involves both the adjacency of the White and Blue objects and the size (pixel count) of the Red object.\n\n**Metrics from Code Execution**\n\nThe following metrics were gathered by analyzing the input grids:\n\n"
