Both grids contain colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9) on a white (0) background.\n2.  **Key Element - Yellow Pixels (4):** Yellow pixels appear in the input grids, typically marking the corners of a rectangular region. These yellow pixels are consistently present in the corners of the output grid.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves extracting a subgrid from the input and placing it into the output grid.\n4.  **Bounding Box:** The yellow pixels in the input define a bounding box. The top-left corner of the box is determined by the minimum row and column of the yellow pixels, and the bottom-right corner by the maximum row and column.\n5.  **Content Extraction:** The content *strictly inside* this bounding box (i.e., excluding the rows and columns containing the yellow boundary pixels) is extracted from the input grid.\n6.  **Output Construction:**\n    *   The output grid's dimensions are determined by the bounding box size (max_row - min_row + 1) x (max_col - min_col + 1).\n    *   The extracted content is placed into the output grid, offset by one row and one column from the top-left (i.e., starting at output grid coordinates [1, 1]).\n    *   The four corner cells of the output grid are set to yellow (4).\n    *   The rest of the output grid (the border rows/columns, excluding corners) remains white (0), unless filled by the copied content.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
