OK, can't use skimage. Let's stick to manual analysis and numpy.

Let's reconsider the examples and the hypothesis: **Copy the pixels from the input grid that correspond to the output grid's non-border area, based on the top-left yellow pixel as the origin.**

Define `min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c` from yellow pixels.
Output `height = max_r - min_r + 1`
Output `width = max_c - min_c + 1`
Output grid `O` is `height x width`. Initialize with 0.
Set `O[0,0] = O[0, W-1] = O[H-1, 0] = O[H-1, W-1] = 4`.
Iterate `r_out` from 1 to `height - 2`.
Iterate `c_out` from 1 to `width - 2`.
  `r_in = min_r + r_out`
  `c_in = min_c + c_out`
  `O[r_out, c_out] = Input[r_in, c_in]`

Let's test this on Example 1:
`min_r=1, min_c=2, max_r=7, max_c=8`. `height=7, width=7`.
Output `O` is 7x7. Corners = 4.
Iterate `r_out` from 1 to 5. Iterate `c_out` from 1 to 5.
  `r_in = 1 + r_out`, `c_in = 2 + c_out`.
  `O[r_out, c_out] = Input[1 + r_out, 2 + c_out]`
Let's fill the output grid `O`:
r_out=1:
  c_out=1: r_in=2, c_in=3. O[1,1] = Input[2,3] = 2
  c_out=2: r_in=2, c_in=4. O[1,2] = Input[2,4] = 2
  c_out=3: r_in=2, c_in=5. O[1,3] = Input[2,5] = 0
  c_out=4: r_in=2, c_in=6. O[1,4] = Input[2,6] = 0
  c_out=5: r_in=2, c_in=7. O[1,5] = Input[2,7] = 0
r_out=2:
  c_out=1: r_in=3, c_in=3. O[2,1] = Input[3,3] = 2
  c_out=2: r_in=3, c_in=4. O[2,2] = Input[3,4] = 2
  c_out=3: r_in=3, c_in=5. O[2,3] = Input[3,5] = 0
  c_out=4: r_in=3, c_in=6. O[2,4] = Input[3,6] = 0
  c_out=5: r_in=3, c_in=7. O[2,5] = Input[3,7] = 0
r_out=3:
  c_out=1: r_in=4, c_in=3. O[3,1] = Input[4,3] = 0
  c_out=2: r_in=4, c_in=4. O[3,2] = Input[4,4] = 0
  c_out=3: r_in=4, c_in=5. O[3,3] = Input[4,5] = 8
  c_out=4: r_in=4, c_in=6. O[3,4] = Input[4,6] = 8
  c_out=5: r_in=4, c_in=7. O[3,5] = Input[4,7] = 0
r_out=4:
  c_out=1: r_in=5, c_in=3. O[4,1] = Input[5,3] = 0
  c_out=2: r_in=5, c_in=4. O[4,2] = Input[5,4] = 0
  c_out=3: r_in=5, c_in=5. O[4,3] = Input[5,5] = 8
  c_out=4: r_in=5, c_in=6. O[4,4] = Input[5,6] = 8
  c_out=5: r_in=5, c_in=7. O[4,5] = Input[5,7] = 0
r_out=5:
  c_out=1: r_in=6, c_in=3. O[5,1] = Input[6,3] = 0
  c_out=2: r_in=6, c_in=4. O[5,2] = Input[6,4] = 0
  c_out=3: r_in=6, c_in=5. O[5,3] = Input[6,5] = 0
  c_out=4: r_in=6, c_in=6. O[5,4] = Input[6,6] = 0
  c_out=5: r_in=6, c_in=7. O[5,5] = Input[6,7] = 0

Resulting `O` grid:

```
4 0 0 0 0 0 4  (Row 0)
0 2 2 0 0 0 0  (Row 1)
0 2 2 0 0 0 0  (Row 2)
0 0 0 8 8 0 0  (Row 3)
0 0 0 8 8 0 0  (Row 4)
0 0 0 0 0 0 0  (Row 5)
4 0 0 0 0 0 4  (Row 6)
```

This matches the `Transformed Output` from the failed execution run! It does *not* match the `Expected Output` because the expected output has extra Green (3) pixels.

**This means the core assumption about how the content is transferred is still wrong.**

Let's rethink. The operation seems related to "cropping" or "windowing".
What if the yellow pixels define a *window* and *everything* visible through that window (relative to the top-left yellow) is copied?

Alternative Hypothesis 3: Define the output grid size by the bounding box. Iterate through *all* non-background pixels in the input. For each pixel `(r_in, c_in)` with color `C`, calculate its position relative to the top-left yellow pixel `(min_r, min_c)`: `rel_r = r_in - min_r`, `rel_c = c_in - min_c`. If `0 <= rel_r < height` and `0 <= rel_c < width`, place the color `C` at `output[rel_r, rel_c]`. Finally, overwrite the corners with yellow (4).

Let's test Hypothesis 3 on Example 1:
`min_r=1, min_c=2`. Output `height=7, width=7`.
Initialize 7x7 output `O` with 0s.
Input pixels (non-zero, non-yellow):
(2,3)=2 -> rel=(1,1). O[1,1]=2.
(2,4)=2 -> rel=(1,2). O[1,2]=2.
(3,3)=2 -> rel=(2,1). O[2,1]=2.
(3,4)=2 -> rel=(2,2). O[2,2]=2.
(4,5)=8 -> rel=(3,3). O[3,3]=8.
(4,6)=8 -> rel=(3,4). O[3,4]=8.
(5,5)=8 -> rel=(4,3). O[4,3]=8.
(5,6)=8 -> rel=(4,4). O[4,4]=8.
(13,10)=2 -> rel=(12,8). Out of bounds.
(13,11)=3 -> rel=(12,9). Out of bounds.
(14,10)=3 -> rel=(13,8). Out of bounds.
(14,11)=8 -> rel=(13,9). Out of bounds.

Resulting `O` grid (before setting corners):

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Setting corners to 4:

```
4 0 0 0 0 0 4
0 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 0 0 4
```

This *still* matches the failed code's output, not the expected output. The green pixels remain unexplained for Example 1.

Is there any interaction between the objects outside the box and the box itself? No overlap.

Could the specific colors matter? Red(2), Azure(8), Green(3), Yellow(4).
Example 1 Expected Output: Red(2), Green(3), Azure(8), Yellow(4).
Example 2 Expected Output: Green(3), Red(2), Blue(1), Yellow(4). Input also had these colors.
Example 3 Expected Output: Red(2), Blue(1), Green(3), Yellow(4). Input also had these colors.

Let's re-examine Example 1 Expected Output:

```
4 0 0 0 0 0 4
0 2 2 3 3 0 0  <- Row 1 (index 1)
0 2 2 3 3 0 0  <- Row 2
0 3 3 8 8 0 0  <- Row 3
0 3 3 8 8 0 0  <- Row 4
0 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Row 5
4 0 0 0 0 0 4
```

Object 1: Red 2x2 at (1,1)-(2,2). Matches input (2,3)-(3,4).
Object 2: Azure 2x2 at (3,3)-(4,4). Matches input (4,5)-(5,6).
Object 3: Green 2x2 at (1,3)-(2,4). No corresponding input object.
Object 4: Green 2x2 at (3,1)-(4,2). No corresponding input object.

Could the objects *outside* the bounding box be involved in a different way?
Obj3: (13,10)=2, (13,11)=3
Obj4: (14,10)=3, (14,11)=8

Maybe the *colors* from the outside objects are used to "paint" areas relative to the inside objects?
Inside objects are Red (1,1)-(2,2) and Azure (3,3)-(4,4).
Outside colors are Red(2), Green(3), Green(3), Azure(8).
The mysterious Green(3) pixels appear adjacent to the copied Red and Azure objects.
Green at (1,3)-(2,4) is right of the Red object.
Green at (3,1)-(4,2) is left of the Azure object.

Let's check Example 2 with this idea.
Input Bounding Box: (0,2) to (8,15). Size 9x14. `min_r=0, min_c=2`.
Input objects *inside* the inner box [rows 1-7, cols 3-14]:
  Green 3x2 at (2,3)-(3,4). Relative (2,1)-(3,2). Output (2,1)-(3,2). Correct.
  Red 2x2 at (2,11)-(3,12). Relative (2,9)-(3,10). Output (2,9)-(3,10). Correct.
  Blue 2x2 at (6,7)-(7,8). Relative (6,5)-(7,6). Output (6,5)-(7,6). Correct.
Input objects *outside* the bounding box:
  Green 1x1 at (12,2). Relative (12,0). Out of bounds (9x14).
  Red 1x1 at (12,6). Relative (12,4). Out of bounds.
  Blue cluster: (13,2)-(13,3)=1, (13,5)-(14,6)=1, (14,3)-(14,5)=1. All relative rows >= 13. Out of bounds.

Expected Output also has large Blue(1) shapes:
Shape 1: (4,1)-(5,4)
Shape 2: (4,7)-(5,10)
Shape 3: (6,3)-(7,8) - This overlaps/contains the mapped Blue object from inside!
Shape 4: (6,3)-(7,8) contains the original blue object at (6,5)-(7,6). The extra blue pixels are at (6,3)-(7,4) and (6,7)-(7,8).
Where do these blue pixels come from? The *only* source of blue in the input is the object at (6,7)-(7,8) inside the box and the cluster outside the box.

This suggests the cluster outside the box *is* used. But how?
Let's consider the relative positions of the outside cluster pixels to `(min_r, min_c) = (0,2)`:
(13,2)=1 -> rel=(13,0). Out.
(13,3)=1 -> rel=(13,1). Out.
(13,5)=1 -> rel=(13,3). Out.
(13,6)=1 -> rel=(13,4). Out.
(14,3)=1 -> rel=(14,1). Out.
(14,4)=1 -> rel=(14,2). Out.
(14,5)=1 -> rel=(14,3). Out.
(14,6)=1 -> rel=(14,4). Out.

This isn't working. Let's step back entirely.

**Observation:** The output grid seems to be a composition.
1.  A frame defined by the yellow pixels.
2.  Content derived from the input grid.

**Hypothesis 4: Layering / Composition**
Layer 1: The bounding box defined by yellow pixels. Size `H x W`.
Layer 2: The content *strictly inside* the bounding box in the input grid (`input[min_r+1:max_r, min_c+1:max_c]`). Let's call this `InnerContent`. It has size `(H-2) x (W-2)`.
Layer 3: Other objects from the input grid?

Let's assume the output is constructed by:
1. Create output grid `O` of size `H x W`, all zeros.
2. Place `InnerContent` into `O` at position `(1, 1)`.
3. Identify other significant structures/colors in the input.
4. Add/modify pixels in `O` based on these other structures.
5. Set corners of `O` to yellow (4).

Consider Example 1 again.
Step 1: Output `O` is 7x7, all zeros.
Step 2: Place `InnerContent` (Red at rel (0,0)-(1,1), Azure at rel (2,2)-(3,3)) into `O` at (1,1).
   `O` becomes:
   
```
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   0 2 2 0 0 0 0
   0 2 2 0 0 0 0
   0 0 0 8 8 0 0
   0 0 0 8 8 0 0
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   ```

Step 3: Other structures: Obj3 (Red/Green line), Obj4 (Green/Azure line). Both are far away.
Step 4: Add/modify? Expected output needs Green pixels added at (1,3)-(2,4) and (3,1)-(4,2).
   Where could Green come from? Obj3 has Green at (13,11). Obj4 has Green at (14,10).
   Is there a concept of "corresponding objects"?
   Input Obj1 (Red) <-> Output Obj1 (Red)
   Input Obj2 (Azure) <-> Output Obj2 (Azure)
   Input Obj3 (Red/Green) ???
   Input Obj4 (Green/Azure) ???
   Maybe Obj3 maps to the Green pixels near Output Obj1?
   Maybe Obj4 maps to the Green pixels near Output Obj2?
   How? Color change? Positional change?
   Obj3 is Red/Green. The added pixels are Green. Maybe keep only Green?
   Obj4 is Green/Azure. The added pixels are Green. Maybe keep only Green?
   Positioning:
   Green from Obj3 relative to Input Obj1? Obj3 (13,11) vs Obj1 (2,3). Delta=(+11, +8). Applying this delta to Output Obj1 (1,1) gives (12,9) - off grid.
   Green from Obj4 relative to Input Obj2? Obj4 (14,10) vs Obj2 (4,5). Delta=(+10, +5). Applying this delta to Output Obj2 (3,3) gives (13,8) - off grid.

   Let's consider the *colors* present outside the box. Green(3) is present. Red(2) is present. Azure(8) is present.
   The colors added to the output are Green(3).
   What if the rule is:
    a. Copy the inner content relatively to output[1,1].
    b. Find the *most frequent non-background, non-yellow color* outside the bounding box.
    c. Use this color to fill empty spaces adjacent to the copied objects?
    Example 1: Outside colors are 2, 3, 3, 8. Background is 0. Most frequent is Green(3).
       Fill neighbours of Red(2) and Azure(8) in the output grid (that are currently 0)?
       Output after step 2:
       
```
       0 0 0 0 0 0 0
       0 2 2 0 0 0 0
       0 2 2 0 0 0 0
       0 0 0 8 8 0 0
       0 0 0 8 8 0 0
       0 0 0 0 0 0 0
       0 0 0 0 0 0 0
       ```

       Neighbors of Red object (1,1)-(2,2): (0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,3),(2,0),(2,3),(3,1),(3,2).
       Neighbors of Azure object (3,3)-(4,4): (2,3),(2,4),(3,2),(3,5),(4,2),(4,5),(5,3),(5,4).
       Fill these with Green(3) if they are 0?
       
```
       0 3 3 0 0 0 0
       3 2 2 3 0 0 0
       3 2 2 3 0 0 0
       0 3 0 8 8 3 0
       0 3 0 8 8 3 0
       0 0 0 3 3 0 0
       0 0 0 0 0 0 0
       ```

       This is too much green. It doesn't match.

**Hypothesis 5: Projection / Overlap**
Maybe the objects outside the box are projected onto the output grid?
Example 1: Obj3 (Red/Green) at (13,10)-(13,11). Obj4 (Green/Azure) at (14,10)-(14,11).
Bounding box: rows 1-7, cols 2-8. Output size 7x7.
Maybe map input row `r` to output row `r % height`? Map input col `c` to output col `c % width`?
Height=7, Width=7.
Obj3: (13,10)=2 -> (13%7, 10%7) = (6,3). Output[6,3] = 2?
      (13,11)=3 -> (13%7, 11%7) = (6,4). Output[6,4] = 3?
Obj4: (14,10)=3 -> (14%7, 10%7) = (0,3). Output[0,3] = 3?
      (14,11)=8 -> (14%7, 11%7) = (0,4). Output[0,4] = 8?

Let's try combining this with Hypothesis 4 (copy inner content first).
Output after inner content copy:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Now add projected outside objects:
O[6,3]=2, O[6,4]=3, O[0,3]=3, O[0,4]=8.

```
0 0 0 3 8 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 3 0 0
```

Finally, set corners to 4.

```
4 0 0 3 8 0 4
0 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 2 3 0 4
```

This doesn't match the expected output either.

Let's look at the relationship between the copied objects and the added green pixels in Example 1 Expected Output.
Red: (1,1)-(2,2)
Azure: (3,3)-(4,4)
Green1: (1,3)-(2,4) -> This is Red shifted right by 2 cols.
Green2: (3,1)-(4,2) -> This is Azure shifted left by 2 cols.

Does this pattern hold for Example 2?
Output size 9x14.
Copied objects:
Green: (2,1)-(3,2)
Red: (2,9)-(3,10)
Blue: (6,5)-(7,6)
Expected output additional objects:
Blue1: (4,1)-(5,4)
Blue2: (4,7)-(5,10)
Blue3: (6,3)-(7,4) (part of larger shape containing copied Blue)
Blue4: (6,7)-(7,8) (part of larger shape containing copied Blue)

Shift Green(2,1) right by 2? -> (2,3)-(3,4). (Blue1 overlaps this)
Shift Red(2,9) right by 2? -> (2,11)-(3,12). (Empty in output)
Shift Blue(6,5) right by 2? -> (6,7)-(7,8). (Matches Blue4)

Shift Green(2,1) left by 2? -> (2,-1)-(3,0). Out of bounds.
Shift Red(2,9) left by 2? -> (2,7)-(3,8). (Blue2 overlaps this)
Shift Blue(6,5) left by 2? -> (6,3)-(7,4). (Matches Blue3)

This looks promising!
**Hypothesis 6:**
1. Define bounding box (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c) and output size (H, W).
2. Create output grid `O` of size HxW, all zeros.
3. Copy the "inner content" from `input[min_r+1:max_r, min_c+1:max_c]` to `O[1:H-1, 1:W-1]`.
4. Find all contiguous objects within this copied inner content in the output grid `O`.
5. For each such object `Obj` of color `C` located at `(r, c)` to `(r+h-1, c+w-1)`:
    a. Create a copy shifted right by 2 columns: `Obj_R`. Place `Obj_R` in `O` at `(r, c+2)`, overwriting existing pixels only if they are background (0). Use the *same* color `C`.
    b. Create a copy shifted left by 2 columns: `Obj_L`. Place `Obj_L` in `O` at `(r, c-2)`, overwriting existing pixels only if they are background (0). Use the *same* color `C`.
6. Set the four corner pixels `O[0,0], O[0,W-1], O[H-1,0], O[H-1,W-1]` to yellow (4).

Let's try Hypothesis 6 on Example 1:
1. Box (1,2)-(7,8). Output 7x7.
2. Output O is 7x7 zeros.
3. Copy inner content: Red at O(1,1)-(2,2), Azure at O(3,3)-(4,4).
   
```
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   0 2 2 0 0 0 0
   0 2 2 0 0 0 0
   0 0 0 8 8 0 0
   0 0 0 8 8 0 0
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   ```

4. Objects in O (excluding borders): Red at (1,1), Azure at (3,3).
5. Process Red object at (1,1)-(2,2):
   a. Shift right by 2: Target (1,3)-(2,4). Pixels O[1,3], O[1,4], O[2,3], O[2,4] are 0. Place Red(2) here.
   b. Shift left by 2: Target (1,-1)-(2,0). Out of bounds or on border. Ignore.
   Intermediate O:
   
```
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   0 2 2 2 2 0 0
   0 2 2 2 2 0 0
   0 0 0 8 8 0 0
   0 0 0 8 8 0 0
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   ```

   Process Azure object at (3,3)-(4,4):
   a. Shift right by 2: Target (3,5)-(4,6). Pixels O[3,5], O[3,6], O[4,5], O[4,6] are 0. Place Azure(8) here.
   b. Shift left by 2: Target (3,1)-(4,2). Pixels O[3,1], O[3,2], O[4,1], O[4,2] are 0. Place Azure(8) here.
   Intermediate O:
   
```
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   0 2 2 2 2 0 0
   0 2 2 2 2 0 0
   0 8 8 8 8 8 8
   0 8 8 8 8 8 8
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   ```

6. Set corners to Yellow(4).
   
```
   4 0 0 0 0 0 4
   0 2 2 2 2 0 0
   0 2 2 2 2 0 0
   0 8 8 8 8 8 8
   0 8 8 8 8 8 8
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   4 0 0 0 0 0 4
   ```

This still doesn't match Example 1's expected output (which had Green pixels). The hypothesis that the *same* color is used for shifted copies must be wrong.

**Hypothesis 7 (Refining H6):** Use a *different* color for the shifted copies. Which color?
Maybe the color comes from the objects outside the box?
Example 1: Outside colors are Red(2), Green(3), Azure(8). Most frequent outside is Green(3).
Let's retry H6, but use Green(3) for the shifted copies.

1. Box (1,2)-(7,8). Output 7x7.
2. Output O is 7x7 zeros.
3. Copy inner content: Red at O(1,1)-(2,2), Azure at O(3,3)-(4,4).

4. Objects in O: Red at (1,1), Azure at (3,3). Outside most frequent color: Green(3).
5. Process Red object at (1,1)-(2,2):
   a. Shift right by 2: Target (1,3)-(2,4). Use Green(3).
   b. Shift left by 2: Target (1,-1)-(2,0). Ignore.
   Intermediate O:

   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   0 2 2 3 3 0 0
   0 2 2 3 3 0 0

   0 0 0 8 8 0 0
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   ```

   Process Azure object at (3,3)-(4,4):
   a. Shift right by 2: Target (3,5)-(4,6). Use Green(3).
   b. Shift left by 2: Target (3,1)-(4,2). Use Green(3).
   Intermediate O:
   
```
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   0 2 2 3 3 0 0
   0 2 2 3 3 0 0

   0 3 3 8 8 3 3
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0

   ```

6. Set corners to Yellow(4).

   0 2 2 3 3 0 0

   0 3 3 8 8 3 3
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   4 0 0 0 0 0 4
   ```

This matches the expected output for Example 1!

Let's test Hypothesis 7 on Example 2:
1. Box (0,2)-(8,15). Output 9x14.
2. Output O is 9x14 zeros.
3. Copy inner content: Green(3) at O(2,1)-(3,2), Red(2) at O(2,9)-(3,10), Blue(1) at O(6,5)-(7,6).
4. Objects in O: Green, Red, Blue. Outside colors: Green(3) at (12,2), Red(2) at (12,6), Blue(1) cluster at (13,2)... Most frequent outside color is Blue(1).
5. Process Green object at (2,1)-(3,2): Use Blue(1) for shifts.
   a. Shift right by 2: Target (2,3)-(3,4). Use Blue(1).
   b. Shift left by 2: Target (2,-1)-(3,0). Ignore.
   Intermediate O gets Blue(1) at (2,3)-(3,4).
