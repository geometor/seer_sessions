**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each task pair consists of an input grid and a smaller output grid. Both grids contain colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9) on a white (0) background.
2.  **Key Element - Yellow Pixels (4):** Yellow pixels appear in the input grids, typically marking the corners of a rectangular region. These yellow pixels are consistently present in the corners of the output grid.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves extracting a subgrid from the input and placing it into the output grid.
4.  **Bounding Box:** The yellow pixels in the input define a bounding box. The top-left corner of the box is determined by the minimum row and column of the yellow pixels, and the bottom-right corner by the maximum row and column.
5.  **Content Extraction:** The content *strictly inside* this bounding box (i.e., excluding the rows and columns containing the yellow boundary pixels) is extracted from the input grid.
6.  **Output Construction:**
    *   The output grid's dimensions are determined by the bounding box size (max_row - min_row + 1) x (max_col - min_col + 1).
    *   The extracted content is placed into the output grid, offset by one row and one column from the top-left (i.e., starting at output grid coordinates [1, 1]).
    *   The four corner cells of the output grid are set to yellow (4).
    *   The rest of the output grid (the border rows/columns, excluding corners) remains white (0), unless filled by the copied content.

  - input yellow pixels determine the output grid size.

  - input content within the bounding box (excluding the boundary) maps directly to the output grid content (offset by [1, 1]).
  - output grid corners are always yellow (4).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all pixels with the color yellow (4) in the input grid.
2.  Determine the minimum row (`min_row`), minimum column (`min_col`), maximum row (`max_row`), and maximum column (`max_col`) among the coordinates of these yellow pixels. This defines the bounding box.
3.  Calculate the dimensions of the output grid: `height = max_row - min_row + 1`, `width = max_col - min_col + 1`.
4.  Create a new grid (the output grid) of size `height` x `width`, initialized entirely with the background color white (0).
5.  Iterate through the input grid for rows `r` from `min_row + 1` to `max_row - 1` and for columns `c` from `min_col + 1` to `max_col - 1`.
6.  For each pixel at input grid coordinate (`r`, `c`), copy its color value to the output grid at coordinate (`r - min_row`, `c - min_col`).
7.  Set the color of the four corner pixels in the output grid to yellow (4):
    *   Output grid [0, 0] = 4
    *   Output grid [0, `width` - 1] = 4
    *   Output grid [`height` - 1, 0] = 4
    *   Output grid [`height` - 1, `width` - 1] = 4
8.  Return the completed output grid.

**General Assessment**

The initial code successfully implemented the core mechanic of identifying a bounding box defined by yellow (4) pixels, creating an output grid of the corresponding size, placing the yellow pixels at the corners, and copying the content found *strictly inside* the bounding box from the input to the output (offset by 1,1).

However, the comparison between the transformed output and the expected output reveals a consistent pattern of discrepancy: the expected output contains additional pixels adjacent to the copied content. These extra pixels are colored, and their color seems related to pixels present in the input grid *outside* the main bounding box. The placement suggests a "shifting" or "echoing" of the objects within the copied content.

The strategy is to refine the natural language program and subsequent code by:
1.  Confirming the bounding box and content extraction logic.
2.  Determining the rule for selecting the color of the additional pixels (likely related to colors outside the input bounding box).
3.  Determining the rule for placing these additional pixels (likely a fixed shift relative to objects within the copied content).

**Gather Metrics**

Let's use code execution to verify assumptions about the bounding box, the most frequent color outside the box, and the structure of the discrepancy.

    steps:

      - Find the maximum frequency.
      - Select the color(s) with the maximum frequency.

      - For each potential position (nr, nc):
        - Check if (nr, nc) is within the output grid bounds.
        - Check if output_grid[nr, nc] is currently background (0).
        - If both conditions are true, set output_grid[nr, nc] = shift_color.

    input: output grid
    action: set pixels at [0, 0], [0, width-1], [height-1, 0], [height-1, width-1] to yellow (4).
relationships:
  - Input yellow pixels define the output grid size and the source region for inner_content.
  - Input pixels outside the bounding box determine the shift_color.
  - Objects copied into the output grid are then used as templates for shifting.
  - Shifted pixels use the shift_color and only fill background cells.
  - Output grid corners are always yellow.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all pixels with the color yellow (4) in the input grid.
2.  Determine the minimum row (`min_row`), minimum column (`min_col`), maximum row (`max_row`), and maximum column (`max_col`) coordinates of these yellow pixels. This defines the bounding box.
3.  Calculate the dimensions of the output grid: `height = max_row - min_row + 1`, `width = max_col - min_col + 1`.
4.  Create a new grid (the output grid) of size `height` x `width`, initialized entirely with the background color white (0).
5.  Examine all pixels in the input grid that are *outside* the bounding box (rows `< min_row` or `> max_row`, or columns `< min_col` or `> max_col`). Find the non-background (non-zero) color that appears most frequently among these outside pixels. If there is a tie in frequency, choose the color with the smallest integer value. This is the `shift_color`. (If no non-background pixels are outside, this step might yield a default color like 0, although this scenario isn't explicitly shown in examples).
6.  Copy the content *strictly inside* the bounding box from the input grid to the output grid. Specifically, copy the pixels from input grid rows `min_row + 1` to `max_row - 1` and columns `min_col + 1` to `max_col - 1` into the output grid starting at position (1, 1) (i.e., input pixel `(r, c)` goes to output pixel `(r - min_row, c - min_col)`).
7.  Identify all distinct, contiguous objects (groups of same-colored, non-background pixels connected horizontally or vertically) within the copied region of the output grid (i.e., rows 1 to `height-2`, columns 1 to `width-2`).
8.  Create a temporary grid or list to store the locations for the shifted pixels to avoid modifying the grid while iterating.
9.  For each identified object and for every pixel `(r, c)` belonging to that object within the output grid:
    *   Consider the position shifted two columns to the left: `(r, c - 2)`. If this position is within the output grid bounds (row `r` is valid, column `c - 2 >= 0`) and the pixel at `output_grid[r, c - 2]` is currently background (0), mark position `(r, c - 2)` to be colored with the `shift_color`.
    *   Consider the position shifted two columns to the right: `(r, c + 2)`. If this position is within the output grid bounds (row `r` is valid, column `c + 2 < width`) and the pixel at `output_grid[r, c + 2]` is currently background (0), mark position `(r, c + 2)` to be colored with the `shift_color`.
10. Apply the changes: Iterate through the marked positions from step 9 and update the output grid by setting the color of those pixels to the `shift_color`. This ensures shifts don't overwrite each other or original object pixels prematurely.
11. Set the color of the four corner pixels in the output grid to yellow (4): `[0, 0]`, `[0, width - 1]`, `[height - 1, 0]`, `[height - 1, width - 1]`. Handle cases where height or width might be 1.
12. Return the completed output grid.
