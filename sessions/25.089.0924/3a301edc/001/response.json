Determine the minimal bounding box that encloses all these non-white pixels.\n3. Identify the two distinct non-white colors present within this bounding box.\n4. Determine which of these two colors corresponds to the 'inner' object. This can be identified as the non-white color whose pixels do not touch the edge of the minimal bounding box. This color becomes the 'fill_color'.\n5. Iterate through each pixel within the calculated bounding box.\n6. If a pixel inside the bounding box has the background color (white, 0) in the input grid, change its color in the output grid to the 'fill_color'.\n7.
