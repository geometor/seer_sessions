"""
Transforms the input grid by performing the following steps:
1. Identify all non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid.
2. Determine the minimal bounding box that encloses all these non-white pixels.
3. Identify the distinct non-white colors present within this bounding box. There are typically two: an 'outer' color forming a frame and an 'inner' color enclosed within.
4. Determine the 'inner' color. This is usually the non-white color within the bounding box whose pixels do not touch the absolute edge of the bounding box. If both colors touch the edge (e.g., if the frame is only 1 pixel thick), the color with the smaller number of pixels within the bounding box is considered the inner color. If there's only one non-white color, that color is used.
5. Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
6. Iterate through each pixel location (r, c) *within* the calculated bounding box.
7. If the pixel at (r, c) in the *original input grid* has the background color (white, 0), change its color in the *output grid* to the determined 'inner' color.
8. Pixels outside the bounding box and pixels that were originally non-white (part of the inner or outer objects) remain unchanged.
9. Return the modified output grid as a list of lists.
