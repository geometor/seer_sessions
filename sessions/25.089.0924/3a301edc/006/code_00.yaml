elements:
  - object: Background
    color: white (0)
    role: Canvas, area to be potentially filled.
  - object: Outer Object/Frame
    property: Contains the Inner Object; touches the edge of the Bounding Box.
    color: Varies (gray, green, magenta, blue, yellow).
    role: Defines the inner boundary for the fill; preserved in output.
  - object: Inner Object
    property: Contained within the Outer Object; does not touch the edge of the Bounding Box.
    color: Varies (red, blue, yellow, red, gray).
    role: Color source for the fill operation; preserved in output.
  - concept: Bounding Box
    definition: The smallest rectangular region containing all non-white pixels.
    role: Defines the outer boundary and the area of operation for the fill.
actions:
  - name: Identify Objects and Bounding Box
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: Bounding Box, Colors present within Bounding Box
  - name: Determine Fill Color
    inputs: input_grid, Bounding Box, Colors
    outputs: fill_color
    description: Identify the unique non-white color within the Bounding Box whose pixels do not touch the edge of the Bounding Box. If both colors touch the edge, the color with fewer pixels within the Bounding Box is the fill_color.
  - name: Fill Area
    inputs: input_grid, Bounding Box, fill_color
    outputs: modified_grid
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. Iterate through pixels within the Bounding Box. If a pixel in the *original* input grid is white (0), change its color in the copy to the fill_color.
relationships:
  - type: Containment
    subject: Outer Object
    object: Inner Object
  - type: Spatial
    description: Fill operation targets white pixels strictly within the Bounding Box.
  - type: Identity
    description: Pixels outside the Bounding Box, and non-white pixels within the Bounding Box, retain their original color.
transformation:
  preserves:
    - Shape, color, and position of Outer and Inner Objects.
    - Color and position of all pixels outside the Bounding Box.
  modifies:
    - White pixels located within the Bounding Box are changed to the fill_color.
