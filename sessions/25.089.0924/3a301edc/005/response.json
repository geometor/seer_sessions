Determine the minimal bounding box that encloses all these non-white pixels.\n3.  Identify the two distinct non-white colors present within this bounding box: an 'outer' color and an 'inner' color.\n4.  Determine the 'inner' color. This is the non-white color within the bounding box whose pixels do *not* touch the absolute edge of the bounding box.\n5.  If both colors have pixels touching the bounding box edge (e.g., if the outer frame is only 1 pixel thick), the color with the *fewer* pixels within the bounding box is considered the 'inner' color.\n6.  If only one non-white color exists, it is used as the 'inner' color.\n7.  Iterate through each pixel location (row, column) *within* the calculated bounding box.\n8.  If a pixel at a location within the bounding box has the background color (white, 0) in the *original input grid*, change its color in the *output grid* to the determined 'inner' color.\n9.  Pixels outside the bounding box and pixels that were originally non-white remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_bounding_box(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the minimum bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) \n    containing all non-zero pixels in the grid.\n    Returns None if the grid contains only zeros.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Find coordinates (row, col) of all non-zero pixels\n    non_zero_coords = np.argwhere(grid != 0)\n    # If no non-zero pixels exist, return None\n    if non_zero_coords.size == 0:\n        return None\n    # Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices\n    min_r, min_c = non_zero_coords.min(axis=0)\n    max_r, max_c = non_zero_coords.max(axis=0)\n    # Return the bounding box coordinates as a tuple\n    return (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)\n\ndef get_inner_color(grid, bbox):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the 'inner' color within the bounding box.\n    It prioritizes the color not touching the bbox edge.
