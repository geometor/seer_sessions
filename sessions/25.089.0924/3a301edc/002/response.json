            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code failed on all training examples, consistently returning the original input grid instead of the transformed one. The transformed output being identical to the input strongly suggests that the core filling mechanism within the `transform` function was never executed. This typically happens if the condition to fill (identifying the target white pixels) is never met, or if the determined `fill_color` is invalid (e.g., `None`), causing the function to return prematurely or skip the modification loop.\n\nThe `get_inner_color` function, responsible for determining the color used for filling, is the most likely source of the error. While its logic aimed to identify the color *not* touching the bounding box edge, potential issues include:\n1.  Errors in the boundary checking logic.\n2.  Incorrect handling of the case where color identification is ambiguous (e.g., both colors touch the edge, or neither does, although this doesn't occur in the examples).\n3.  The ambiguity resolution (comparing pixel counts) returning `None` if counts were equal, leading to the `transform` function returning the unmodified grid.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the `get_inner_color` logic to be simpler and more robust, based strictly on the observed pattern: the fill color is the non-background color whose pixels do *not* lie on the edge of the minimal bounding box containing all non-background pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's analyze each example to confirm the properties:\n\n"
