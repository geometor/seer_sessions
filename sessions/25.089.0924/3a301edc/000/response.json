Embedded within this background are typically two distinct non-white colored objects.\n2.  **Object Arrangement**: The non-white objects appear nested. There's an \"outer\" object, often resembling a frame or border, and an \"inner\" object completely contained within the outer one.\n3.  **Color Usage**: Each example uses exactly two non-white colors: one for the outer object and one for the inner object. The background is always white (0).\n4.  **Transformation Goal**: The transformation modifies the area *around* the outer object, but *within* its overall bounding box.\n5.  **Filling Mechanism**: The white space located between the outer object and the boundary of the minimal bounding box containing all non-white pixels is filled with the color of the *inner* object.\n6.  **Object Preservation**: The original outer and inner objects remain unchanged in shape, color, and position in the output grid.\n7.  **Bounding Box**: The key area of operation is defined by the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that encloses all non-white pixels in the input.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Determine the minimum bounding box that encloses all these non-white pixels. Define this as the \"active area\" (using minimum/maximum row and column indices of non-white pixels).\n4.  Identify the two distinct non-white colors present in the input grid.\n5.  Determine which of these two colors corresponds to the \"inner\" object (the one not touching the background within the bounding box, or simply the one not forming the outermost layer of non-white pixels). This is the `fill_color`.\n6.  Iterate through each pixel within the rows and columns defined by the active area (bounding box).\n7.  For each pixel within this active area, check if its color in the *original input grid* is white (0).\n8.  If the pixel is within the active area and its original color is white (0), change its color in the *output grid* to the `fill_color`.\n9.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid (those originally non-white, and those outside the active area) unchanged from their input values.\n10. Return the modified output grid."
