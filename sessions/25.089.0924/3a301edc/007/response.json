Determine the minimal bounding box that encloses all these non-white pixels.\n3.  Identify the distinct non-white colors present within this bounding box: an 'outer' color and an 'inner' color. There should be either one or two such colors.\n4.  Determine the 'inner' color (which will be used as the fill_color):\n    a. If only one non-white color exists within the bounding box, it is the inner color.\n    b. If two non-white colors exist, the inner color is the one whose pixels do *not* touch the absolute edge of the bounding box.\n    c. If both colors have pixels touching the bounding box edge (e.g., if the outer frame is only 1 pixel thick), the color with the *fewer* total pixels within the bounding box is considered the 'inner' color.\n    d. If ambiguity remains (e.g., >2 colors, neither touches edge, both touch edge with equal counts), the transformation cannot proceed reliably.\n5.  Create a copy of the input grid.\n6.  Iterate through each pixel location (row, column) *within* the calculated bounding box.\n7.  If a pixel at a location within the bounding box has the background color (white, 0) in the *original input grid*, change its color in the *copied output grid* to the determined 'inner' (fill) color.\n8.  Pixels outside the bounding box and pixels that were originally non-white remain unchanged in the output grid.\n9. Return the modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef find_bounding_box(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the minimum bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) \n    containing all non-zero pixels in the grid.\n    Returns None if the grid contains only zeros.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Find coordinates (row, col) of all non-zero pixels\n    non_zero_coords = np.argwhere(grid != 0)\n    # If no non-zero pixels exist, return None\n    if non_zero_coords.size == 0:\n        return None\n    # Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices\n    min_r, min_c = non_zero_coords.min(axis=0)\n    max_r, max_c = non_zero_coords.max(axis=0)\n    # Return the bounding box coordinates as a tuple\n    return (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)\n\ndef get_inner_color(grid, bbox):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the 'inner' color within the bounding box based on edge contact\n    and pixel count as tie-breaker.\n    Returns the integer color value or None if indeterminate.\n    \"\"\"\n    min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c = bbox\n    \n    # Extract the subgrid defined by the bounding box\n    subgrid = grid[min_r : max_r + 1, min_c : max_c + 1]\n    # Find unique non-zero colors within this subgrid\n    unique_colors = np.unique(subgrid[subgrid != 0])\n\n    # Handle cases based on the number of unique non-zero colors found\n    if len(unique_colors) == 0:\n         # Should not happen if bbox is valid\n         return None\n    if len(unique_colors) == 1:\n         # Rule 4a: Only one non-white color present; it acts as the fill color\n         return unique_colors[0]\n    if len(unique_colors) != 2:\n        # Rule 4d: The pattern observed relies on exactly one or two non-white colors\n        return None\n\n    # Rule 4b/4c: We have exactly two colors\n    color1, color2 = unique_colors\n\n    # Check which color touches the boundary of the *bounding box*\n    color1_touches_boundary = False\n    color2_touches_boundary = False\n\n    # Check vertical edges (left: min_c, right: max_c) for rows min_r to max_r\n    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):\n        if grid[r, min_c] == color1 or grid[r, max_c] == color1:\n            color1_touches_boundary = True\n        if grid[r, min_c] == color2 or grid[r, max_c] == color2:\n            color2_touches_boundary = True\n        # Optimization: if both found touching, no need to check further rows for vertical edges\n        if color1_touches_boundary and color2_touches_boundary:\n            break\n\n    # Check horizontal edges (top: min_r, bottom: max_r) for columns min_c to max_c\n    # Only check if needed (i.e., if distinction not yet made)\n    if not (color1_touches_boundary and color2_touches_boundary):\n         for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1): # Check all columns including edges\n            if grid[min_r, c] == color1 or grid[max_r, c] == color1:\n                color1_touches_boundary = True\n            if grid[min_r, c] == color2 or grid[max_r, c] == color2:\n                color2_touches_boundary = True\n            # Optimization: if both found touching, no need to check further columns\n            if color1_touches_boundary and color2_touches_boundary:\n                break\n\n    # Determine the inner color based on edge contact\n    if color1_touches_boundary and not color2_touches_boundary:\n        # Rule 4b: Only color1 touches the edge, so color2 must be inner\n        return color2\n    elif not color1_touches_boundary and color2_touches_boundary:\n        # Rule 4b: Only color2 touches the edge, so color1 must be inner\n        return color1\n    elif color1_touches_boundary and color2_touches_boundary:\n        # Rule 4c: Both colors touch the edge.
