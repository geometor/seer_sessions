**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the grid structure, regions, and the concept of swapping region contents. However, the execution results show that the rule for selecting *which* regions swap or move was incorrect. The failures indicate two distinct transformation scenarios:

1.  **Identical Pattern Swapping (Example 1):** When multiple regions contain the exact same pattern (excluding background and grid lines), specific swaps occur based on the number and arrangement of these identical regions. The initial "swap 1st/2nd, 3rd/4th" logic was too simplistic. The actual logic seems to depend on the count (N) and possibly the spatial arrangement (e.g., linear vs. 2x2 block).
    *   For N=3 identical regions (Green L's), the last two in sorted order are swapped.
    *   For N=4 identical regions forming a 2x2 block (Blue +'s), regions in the same column are swapped vertically.
2.  **Adjacent Pattern Cycling (Example 2):** When adjacent regions contain *different* patterns, a specific cyclic transformation can occur. In Example 2, a 2x2 block of four different non-empty patterns results in a 3-cycle rotation of content among the top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right regions, leaving the top-left unchanged.

The strategy is to refine the transformation logic to handle these two distinct scenarios based on whether adjacent/grouped regions share identical patterns or not.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's verify the region definitions and patterns for Example 1 and 2.
