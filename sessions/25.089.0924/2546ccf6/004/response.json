            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the core components: grid lines, regions, and patterns. It also hypothesized two potential transformation rules: one for groups of identical patterns and one for 2x2 blocks of distinct patterns.\n\nHowever, the implementation failed to correctly apply these rules to the training examples.\n\n*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code seems to have incorrectly applied or prioritized the rules. The actual transformation involves swapping pairs of regions with identical patterns, regardless of their arrangement in a 2x2 block. The `Transformed Output` shows that *some* swaps happened (the blue patterns swapped) but not others (the green patterns did not swap correctly). This suggests the grouping or the pairwise swapping logic needs correction.\n*   **Example 2 Failure:** The code failed to execute the 3-cycle rotation for the 2x2 block of distinct patterns. The `Transformed Output` shows minimal changes from the input, incorrectly leaving the block largely untouched, except for perhaps erasing a pixel in the bottom-right region. This points to a bug in detecting the 2x2 distinct pattern condition or in executing the rotation placement.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Simplify Rule 1:** Implement the pairwise swapping for *all* groups of identical patterns (size >= 2). Sort regions within the group by coordinates (row, then column) and swap the content of the 1st with 2nd, 3rd with 4th, etc.\n2.  **Verify Rule 2:** Re-implement the 2x2 distinct pattern detection and the 3-cycle rotation (TR->BL, BL->BR, BR->TR). Ensure the pattern comparison correctly identifies four unique, non-empty patterns and that the content placement works as intended.\n3.  **Rule Precedence:** Explicitly define that the 2x2 rule (Rule 2) should be checked for and applied first. Mark the involved regions as processed. Then, apply the identical pattern swapping (Rule 1) only to regions *not* already processed by Rule 2.\n4.  **Careful Implementation:** Pay close attention to coordinate handling, content caching (getting original content before overwriting), and placement logic.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's quantify the errors in the previous attempt's outputs using `code_execution`.\n"
