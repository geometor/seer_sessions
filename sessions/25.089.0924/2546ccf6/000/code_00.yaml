grid_structure:
  description: Input grid is partitioned by solid horizontal and vertical lines of a single dominant color (grid_line_color).
  grid_line_color: Variable (e.g., Red=2, Magenta=6). Defines boundaries for regions.
  grid_lines_preserved: True. The positions and color of grid lines remain unchanged in the output.
regions:
  definition: Rectangular areas bounded by grid lines and/or the overall grid borders.
  properties:
    - location: Defined by top-left and bottom-right coordinates.
    - content: A subgrid containing pixels. Can be empty (background color only) or contain a pattern.
patterns:
  definition: The specific arrangement and colors of non-background pixels within a region's content. Excludes the grid_line_color.
  role: Used as the key for identifying regions to be potentially swapped. Identity requires matching shape, colors, and relative positions within the region.
transformation:
  type: Swapping content between pairs of regions.
  conditions:
    - Regions must contain identical patterns (shape and color).
    - Regions must belong to the same group of identical patterns.
  process:
    1. Identify grid lines and define regions.
    2. Extract the pattern from each non-empty region.
    3. Group regions based on identical patterns.
    4. For each group with 2 or more regions:
       a. Sort regions by position (e.g., row-major order of top-left corners).
       b. Form pairs: (1st, 2nd), (3rd, 4th), etc.
       c. Swap the *entire content* of the regions within each pair.
  unaffected_elements:
    - Grid lines.
    - Empty regions (containing only background color).
    - Regions with unique patterns (group size 1).
    - The last region in a group with an odd number of members.
