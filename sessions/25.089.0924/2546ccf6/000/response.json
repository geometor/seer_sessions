This color acts as a frame or separator.\n2.  **Regions:** These grid lines partition the grid into multiple rectangular sub-regions.\n3.  **Region Content:** Some regions are empty (filled with the background color, White=0), while others contain distinct patterns or shapes composed of one or more non-background, non-grid-line colors (Green=3/Blue=1 in train_1, Yellow=4 in train_2).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a selective swapping of content between pairs of regions. The grid lines themselves, empty regions, and regions with unique patterns remain unchanged.\n5.  **Pairing Logic:** The swapping occurs between regions that contain *identical* patterns (considering both shape and color).\n6.  **Grouping and Ordering:** Regions with the same pattern are grouped. Within each group, regions are conceptually ordered (e.g., top-to-bottom, left-to-right based on their top-left corner).\n7.  **Swapping Mechanism:** The swapping happens between consecutive regions in the ordered list within each group (the 1st swaps with the 2nd, the 3rd swaps with the 4th, and so on). If a group has an odd number of regions, the last one remains in its original place.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Find the row and column indices (`grid_rows`, `grid_cols`) corresponding to these lines.\n2.  **Define Regions:** Use the `grid_rows` and `grid_cols` (along with the grid boundaries 0, H-1, 0, W-1) to define the bounding boxes of all rectangular regions within the grid.\n3.  **Extract and Characterize Region Contents:** For each defined region:\n    a.  Extract the subgrid representing its content.\n    b.  Determine if the region is empty (contains only background color) or if it contains a pattern (includes non-background, non-`grid_line_color` pixels).\n    c.  Store the pattern (the subgrid content) and the region's location/index.\n4.  **Group Regions by Identical Patterns:** Create groups where each group contains the locations/indices of regions having identical non-empty patterns.\n5.  **Identify Swap Pairs:** For each group of regions with identical patterns:\n    a.  If the group contains fewer than two regions, do nothing with this group.\n    b.  If the group contains two or more regions, sort the region locations/indices based on their top-left corner (primarily by row, secondarily by column).\n    c.  Iterate through the sorted list, pairing the first with the second, the third with the fourth, and so on. Record these pairs (e.g., `(region_index_A, region_index_B)`).\n6.  **Perform Swaps:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid. For each identified pair `(region_A, region_B)`:\n    a.  Get the content (subgrid) of `region_A` from the *input* grid.\n    b.  Get the content (subgrid) of `region_B` from the *input* grid.\n    c.  Place the content of `region_A` into the location of `region_B` in the *output* grid.\n    d.  Place the content of `region_B` into the location of `region_A` in the *output* grid.\n7.  **Finalize Output:** The modified output grid, containing the swapped region contents and all original unchanged elements (grid lines, empty regions, unswapped pattern regions), is the result."
