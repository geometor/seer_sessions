task_description: Fill connected orange regions with magenta if they touch a red pixel, respecting magenta barriers.
elements:
  - type: pixel
    color: orange (7)
    role: Fillable Target. Represents areas that can potentially change color.
  - type: pixel
    color: red (2)
    role: Source / Initiator. Remains unchanged. Triggers the fill operation in adjacent/connected orange areas.
  - type: pixel
    color: magenta (6)
    role: Barrier / Fill Color. Pixels of this color in the input act as impassable barriers, blocking connectivity. Pixels of this color are also the result of the fill operation on orange pixels. Input magenta pixels remain unchanged.
grid_properties:
  connectivity: 8-way adjacency (including diagonals) is used to determine connected components.
transformation:
  type: Conditional Connected Components Fill
  rule: >
    1. Identify all connected components formed exclusively by orange (7) and red (2) pixels in the input grid.
    2. Connectivity is determined by 8-way adjacency.
    3. Magenta (6) pixels are treated as absolute barriers; components cannot cross or include magenta pixels.
    4. For each distinct component found:
        a. Check if the component contains at least one red (2) pixel.
        b. If it contains a red (2) pixel, then change the color of all orange (7) pixels within that specific component to magenta (6).
  output_grid: A new grid where the identified orange pixels have been changed to magenta, while all original red and magenta pixels, and unaffected orange pixels, retain their original colors and positions.
invariants:
  - Red (2) pixels are never modified.
  - Magenta (6) pixels present in the input grid are never modified.
  - Orange (7) pixels not connected (via an 8-way path of orange/red pixels, avoiding magenta barriers) to a red (2) pixel are never modified.
