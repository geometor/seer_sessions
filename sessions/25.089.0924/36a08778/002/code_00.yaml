task_description: Fill areas within distinct vertical regions based on connectivity to source objects within those regions.
elements:
  - type: background
    color: orange (7)
    role: Fillable area within regions.
  - type: region_boundary
    color: magenta (6)
    shape: Vertical lines spanning the grid height.
    role: Fixed, impassable barriers dividing the grid into independent vertical regions. Remain unchanged.
  - type: source
    color: red (2)
    shape: Irregular blocks.
    role: Initiates the fill process for connected orange pixels *within the same region*. Remain unchanged.
  - type: fill_target
    color: orange (7)
    role: Pixels eligible to be filled if connected to a source within their region.
  - type: fill_color
    color: magenta (6)
    role: The color used to fill target pixels.
regions:
  definition: Vertical sections of the grid separated by `region_boundary` (magenta) lines or the grid's vertical edges.
  scope: Fill operations (connectivity search and color change) are strictly contained within these regions.
transformation:
  type: Region-Based Conditional Fill / Connected Components Coloring
  input_elements: background (orange), region_boundary (magenta), source (red)
  output_elements: background (orange), region_boundary (magenta), source (red), filled_area (magenta)
  rule: For each vertical region defined by magenta lines/grid edges: find connected components of source (red) and target (orange) pixels using 8-way adjacency. If a component contains a source (red) pixel, change all target (orange) pixels *within that component and that region* to the fill color (magenta).
relationships:
  - relation: connectivity
    elements: [source (red), target (orange)]
    constraints: Must be within the same defined vertical region. Uses 8-way adjacency. Cannot cross any magenta pixel.
  - relation: boundary_constraint
    elements: [region_boundary (magenta)]
    effect: Defines independent vertical regions. Blocks fill propagation between regions.
invariants:
  - Original `region_boundary` (magenta) pixels remain unchanged.
  - Original `source` (red) pixels remain unchanged.
  - Orange pixels not connected (via orange/red paths) to a red source *within their own region* remain unchanged.
  - Orange pixels in regions containing no red sources remain unchanged.
