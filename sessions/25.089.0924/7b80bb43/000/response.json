The background color is the most frequent color in the input grid.\n3.  **Input Patterns:** The inputs contain scattered foreground pixels, as well as horizontal and vertical lines or small blocks made of the foreground color, all set against the background color.\n4.  **Output Patterns:** The outputs are largely similar to the inputs, maintaining the grid size and the primary colors.\n5.  **Key Transformations:** Two main types of changes are observed between input and output:\n    *   **Pixel Removal:** In Example 1, a single magenta pixel (at row 3, col 19) that was surrounded horizontally and vertically by blue pixels is changed to blue in the output. This suggests a rule for removing \"isolated\" foreground pixels.\n    *   **Gap Filling:** In both examples, horizontal gaps of background pixels that are situated directly between two foreground pixels *on the same row* are filled with the foreground color. This occurred in Example 1 (row 7 and row 9) and Example 2 (row 9). The size of the gap filled can be one or more pixels.\n6.  **Consistency:** The transformation appears to happen in two stages: first, cleaning up isolated pixels, and second, filling horizontal gaps based on the cleaned-up state.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

If a pixel has the foreground color, check its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right). If *none* of these neighbors have the foreground color, change the color of the current pixel to the background color. Perform this check for all foreground pixels based on the state *before* any changes in this step are made (or iterate until no more changes occur).\n4.  **Fill Horizontal Gaps:** Iterate through each row of the grid modified in Step 3. Within each row, scan from left to right. If you encounter a sequence like `[Foreground Pixel] [Background Pixel] ... [Background Pixel] [Foreground Pixel]`, change all the background pixels within that sequence to the foreground color. Repeat this for all such sequences found in every row.\n5.  **Output:** The final state of the working grid after completing Step 4 is the output grid."
