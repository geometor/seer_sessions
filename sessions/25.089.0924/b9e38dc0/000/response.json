            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve a 2D grid of colored pixels. The output grid always has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n2.  **Colors:** Each task uses a distinct set of colors. There's typically a dominant background color.\n3.  **Objects/Regions:** We can perceive distinct regions or objects formed by contiguous pixels of the same color. In Example 1, there's a green outline. In Example 2, scattered gray pixels. In Example 3, scattered maroon, magenta, azure, and green pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a 'fill' operation. A specific region of the background color is replaced with another color.\n5.  **Key Colors:** In each example, three types of colors seem crucial:\n    *   **Background Color:** The color that fills most of the grid initially and is the target for replacement (Blue 1 in Ex1, White 0 in Ex2, Orange 7 in Ex3). This appears to be the most frequent color in the input.\n    *   **Seed/Fill Color:** The color that initiates the fill and is used to replace the background color (Maroon 9 in Ex1, Yellow 4 in Ex2, Green 3 in Ex3). This color often appears uniquely or in a small, distinct group in the input.\n    *   **Boundary Color(s):** Colors that are neither background nor seed, and act as barriers to the fill operation (Green 3 & Gray 5 in Ex1, Gray 5 in Ex2, Maroon 9, Magenta 6, Azure 8 in Ex3).\n6.  **Fill Mechanism:** The fill seems to originate from or be triggered by the 'seed' pixel(s). It spreads into the adjacent 'background' colored pixels. The spread stops when it hits a 'boundary' color pixel or the grid edge. This strongly suggests a flood fill algorithm targeting the connected component of the background color that touches the seed pixel(s).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
