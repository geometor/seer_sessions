"""
Transforms the input grid by performing a flood fill operation originating from specific 'seed' pixels.

The transformation follows these steps:
1. Identify the background color: This is the most frequent color in the input grid.
2. Identify the seed/fill color: A heuristic is used - it's assumed to be the least frequent color among all colors that are cardinally adjacent to the background color in the input grid.
3. Identify seed pixel locations: These are all pixels in the input grid matching the identified seed/fill color.
4. Initialize a processing queue: Add all background-colored pixels that are cardinally adjacent to any seed pixel location to the queue. Mark these pixels as visited.
5. Perform flood fill:
   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a pixel location (r, c).
   - Change the color of this pixel in the output grid to the seed/fill color.
   - Examine the four cardinal neighbors of (r, c).
   - If a neighbor is within grid bounds, has the background color in the *input* grid, and has not been visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.
6. Return the modified grid.

Note: The heuristic for identifying the seed/fill color (step 2) is based on observations from the training examples but might not be universally applicable to all possible test cases for this task type if the underlying rule is different. It correctly identifies the seed/fill color for train_1 and train_2, but not for train_3.
