            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Each example presents an input grid and a corresponding output grid. The grids have a background color filling most cells.\n2.  **Key Elements:** Within each input grid, besides the background, there are typically two other types of elements:\n    *   A cluster of white (0) pixels forming a small shape.\n    *   A single, isolated pixel of a distinct color (green, red, azure in the examples). This color is different from both the background and white.\n3.  **Transformation:** The output grid is largely identical to the input grid, except for the addition of new pixels. These new pixels are the same color as the single, isolated pixel found in the input.\n4.  **Pattern of Added Pixels:** The added pixels form a diagonal line or \"trail\" starting from the position *below* the original isolated pixel and extending downwards towards the bottom edge of the grid.\n5.  **Directionality:** The diagonal trail seems to move either down-left or down-right.\n    *   In example 1 (green pixel), the trail goes down-left.\n    *   In examples 2 and 3 (red and azure pixels), the trail goes down-right.\n6.  **Determining Direction:** The direction appears related to the horizontal position of the single colored pixel relative to the white shape.\n    *   In example 1, the green pixel is horizontally to the left of the white shape. The trail goes down-left.\n    *   In examples 2 and 3, the red and azure pixels are horizontally to the right of the white shape(s). The trails go down-right.\n7.  **Stopping Condition:** The trail continues until it reaches the bottom boundary of the grid. It does not seem to interact with or be blocked by the white shape.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Find all pixels with color 0 (white). Calculate their average row and column index to determine the centroid of the white shape.\n4.  Find the single \"source\" pixel whose color is neither the background color nor white. Record its color (`source_color`) and its position (`source_row`, `source_col`).\n5.  Determine the horizontal step (`delta_col`):\n    *   If `source_col` is less than the white shape's centroid column, set `delta_col` to -1 (move left).\n    *   Otherwise (if `source_col` is greater than or equal to the centroid column), set `delta_col` to +1 (move right).\n6.  Set the vertical step `delta_row` to +1 (always move down).\n7.  Initialize the current position for drawing the trail: `current_row = source_row + delta_row`, `current_col = source_col + delta_col`.\n8.  Start a loop that continues as long as `current_row` is within the grid's height boundary:\n    a.  Check if `current_col` is within the grid's width boundary.\n    b.  If both `current_row` and `current_col` are within the grid boundaries, change the color of the pixel at (`current_row`, `current_col`) in the output grid to `source_color`.\n    c.  Update the current position: `current_row = current_row + delta_row`, `current_col = current_col + delta_col`.\n9.  Return the modified output grid."
