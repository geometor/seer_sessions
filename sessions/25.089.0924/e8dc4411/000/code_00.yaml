Task: Generate a diagonal trail from a specific source pixel.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors).
  - Background_Color: The most frequent color in the grid.
  - White_Shape:
      - Color: 0 (white)
      - Type: A contiguous or scattered group of pixels.
      - Function: Appears to act as a reference point for direction.
      - Property: Centroid (average row/column of white pixels).
  - Source_Pixel:
      - Color: A single color distinct from the background and white.
      - Type: A single pixel object.
      - Function: Origin point for the generated trail.
      - Property: Position (row, column).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Modified version of the input grid.
  - Trail:
      - Color: Same as the Source_Pixel color.
      - Shape: Diagonal line segment.
      - Start: Position directly below the Source_Pixel (row + 1).
      - Path: Extends diagonally downwards (either down-left or down-right).
      - End: Terminates upon reaching the bottom edge of the grid.

Relationships:
  - Trail_Direction_Dependency: The diagonal direction (down-left vs. down-right) depends on the horizontal position of the Source_Pixel relative to the centroid of the White_Shape.
    - If Source_Pixel.column < White_Shape.centroid.column, direction is down-left (delta_row=+1, delta_col=-1).
    - If Source_Pixel.column >= White_Shape.centroid.column, direction is down-right (delta_row=+1, delta_col=+1).

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the Background_Color, White_Shape pixels, and the Source_Pixel.
  - Calculate: Compute the centroid of the White_Shape.
  - Determine: Establish the trail's diagonal direction based on the relative horizontal positions.
  - Generate: Create the trail by iteratively adding pixels of the Source_Pixel color, starting below the Source_Pixel and moving diagonally downwards according to the determined direction, until the grid's bottom boundary is reached.
  - Copy: Preserve all original pixels from the input grid in the output grid.
