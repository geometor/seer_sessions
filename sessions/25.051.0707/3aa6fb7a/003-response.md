Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: three 2x1 vertical lines, and a couple of single cells
        positions:
          - (0,4), (1,4)
          - (0,5), (1,5)
          - (2,2), (3,2)
          - (3,3), (4,3)
          - (5,4)
          - (6,3), (6,4)
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions: fills the rest of the grid
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: Same vertical components as the input
        positions: the vertical components from the input are preserved
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cells
        positions:
          - (0,5)
          - (2,3)
          - (5,3)
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions: fills the rest of the grid
```

**Natural Language Description of Transformation:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe some vertical components of color 8 (azure), made of contiguous cells of the same color stacked on top of each other forming columns. The remaining cells have color 0 (white).

2.  **Detect Changes:** The azure vertical lines in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid. However, new single cells of color 1 (blue) appear in the output grid.

3.  **Describe Actions:**
    -   The transformation identifies the azure vertical lines and preserves them.
    -   For each azure line, it finds the top cell and identifies the cell to the right. The color of this cell to the right is changed to 1 (blue).

**Natural Language Program:**

```
for each vertical azure line in the input:
    find top_cell
    find right_neighbor = cell to the right of the top_cell
    set color of right_neighbor to blue

```

The natural language program and the Python implementation are identical to the first example, as the underlying transformation rule is the same. The code correctly handles multiple vertical lines of color 8 and places the blue cell to the right of the top cell of each identified line.
