The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white).\n\n2.  **Detect Changes:** We can see changes in the output inside each one of the azure lines. In the output grid, the azure lines that were found in the input, are kept intact.\n\n3.  **Describe Action:** Within each azure line, the program searches for the cell located immediately to the right of the top cell of each vertical line. The color of this cell is changed to 1 (blue). If the cell to the right of the bottom cell of each line is also azure, it keeps its original color.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n```\nfor each vertical azure line in the input:\n    find top_cell\n    find right_neighbor = cell to the right of the top_cell\n    set color of right_neighbor to blue\n    \n```\n"
