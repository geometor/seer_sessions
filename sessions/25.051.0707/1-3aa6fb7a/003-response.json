The remaining cells have color 0 (white).\n\n2.  **Detect Changes:** The azure vertical lines in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid. However, new single cells of color 1 (blue) appear in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Describe Actions:**\n    -   The transformation identifies the azure vertical lines and preserves them.\n    -   For each azure line, it finds the top cell and identifies the cell to the right. The color of this cell to the right is changed to 1 (blue).\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n```\nfor each vertical azure line in the input:\n    find top_cell\n    find right_neighbor = cell to the right of the top_cell\n    set color of right_neighbor to blue\n\n```\n\nThe natural language program and the Python implementation are identical to the first example, as the underlying transformation rule is the same. The code correctly handles multiple vertical lines of color 8 and places the blue cell to the right of the top cell of each identified line.\n"
