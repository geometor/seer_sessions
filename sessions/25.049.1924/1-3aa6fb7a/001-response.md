Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shapes, one mirrored"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shapes, one mirrored"
     - color: 1
       positions: [(4,4), (1,2)]
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct objects of color `8` (azure). One object at the top left, is composed by cells (1,1), (2,1) and (2,2). The other one, at the bottom right, is composed by cells (3,4), (3,5) and (4,5).

2.  **Detect Changes:** The azure objects remain unchanged between the input and output. In the output we can observe two new blue pixels (color code 1).

3.  **Describe New Objects:**
 *    The first new pixel in the output is at the position (1,2) of the original top-left shape.
 *    The second new pixel in the output is at the position (4,4) the original bottom-right shape.

4. **Transformation rule**: For each azure object, compute the centroid and change the value of this cell to `1` (blue).

**Step-by-step transformation**
1. Find each isolated azure object.
2. For each of them: Paint with blue the cell corresponding to their centroid.
