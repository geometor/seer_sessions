The selection criteria is:\n    *   Select left-most for horizontal line\n    *   Select upper-most for vertical line\n\n4.  **Preserve:** All other cells maintain their original colors.\n\nThe core rule is the same as the first case. It is necessary to identify objects colored in azure (8). In each object find the corner cell: leftmost if is part of a horizontal line and uppermost if is part of a vertical line. Change to blue the cells identified in this way.\n"
