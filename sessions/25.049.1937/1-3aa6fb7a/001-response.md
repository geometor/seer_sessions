Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [7, 7]
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [4, 4], [4, 5], [5,4]]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure (8) colored rectangles."
    - color: 0
      positions: "All other cells that don't have color 8"
      shape: "background"
output_grid:
  dimensions: [7, 7]
  objects:
     - color: 8
       positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [4, 4], [4, 5], [5,4]]
       shape: "Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure (8) colored rectangles."
     - color: 1
       positions: [[1,2], [5,4]]
       shape: "Two isolated blue (1) colored cells."
     - color: 0
       positions: "All other cells that don't have color 1 or 8"
       shape: "background"

```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation rule:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of two distinct azure (color 8) objects and the white background (color 0).
    *    Object 1: A 2x1 rectangle at the top-left.
    *    Object 2: A 1x2 rectangle at the bottom-right.

2.  **Detect corner cell in the objects:**
    *  Object 1 has cell [1,1] as part of a vertical line.
    *  Object 2 has cell [5,4] as part of a horizontal line

3.  **Change cells:** Change the azure (8) color of those cells in each object by the blue color (1).

4.  **Preserve:** All the other cells keep the original color.

In summary, the rule involves identifying azure objects, finding the corner cell in the biggest rectangle of the object, and turning to blue this cell. Other cells remain the same.
