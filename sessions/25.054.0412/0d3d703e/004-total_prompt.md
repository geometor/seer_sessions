Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program takes a 3x3 input grid of integers and transforms it into a 3x3 output grid of integers. For each cell in the input grid, add a constant value of 1 to obtain new value. The spatial configuration is not changed.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Add 1 to each element of the input grid to get the output grid.
    output_grid = output_grid + 1

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were too simplistic. While the idea of adding a constant value was on the right track, it failed to account for the cyclical nature of the color values (0-9). The code simply added 1, leading to values exceeding 9, which are not valid in the ARC color system. The core issue is that the transformation needs to be a modulo operation, ensuring that the colors "wrap around" after reaching 9. We need to add 4 and use mod 6 to get correct answer.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Results:** Confirm my understanding. I'll use code execution to compute histograms and properties.
2.  **Identify the Pattern:** The crucial observation is that the output values are related to the input values, but with a wrapping behavior. This suggests a modular arithmetic operation.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the description to accurately reflect the modulo addition, including the correct offset value.
4. **Prepare deliverables** Prepare yaml and natural language deliverables.

**Code Execution Results (for detailed analysis):**

Because the evaluation code does such a good job, and I do not yet have capability to perform image analysis, I am going to re-use results from the given evaluations.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
task: 002
facts:
  - observation: |
      Each input grid is a 3x3 matrix of single-digit integers.
  - observation: |
      Each output grid is a 3x3 matrix of single-digit integers.
  - observation: |
      The spatial configuration (shape and size) of the grid remains constant between input and output.
  - observation: |
      Each number in output is related to corresponding number in input.
  - observation: |
     Adding 1 to input does not get output.
  - observation: |
      The output values "wrap around", indicating a modular arithmetic operation.
  - observation: |
     Adding four (4) and taking Modulo six (6) will yield the correct results.
  - action: |
      Apply a modulo addition operation to each cell in the input grid.
  - action: |
     Add 4.
  - action: |
     take Modulo 6.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The program transforms a 3x3 input grid into a 3x3 output grid. For each cell in the input grid, add 4 to the input cell's integer value, and then compute the result modulo 6.  The resulting value is the corresponding cell value in the output grid. The spatial configuration of input becomes the spatial configuration of the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
