facts:
  - observation: |
      Each input grid is a 3x3 matrix of single-digit integers.
  - observation: |
      Each output grid is a 3x3 matrix of single-digit integers.
  - observation: |
      The spatial configuration (shape and size) of the grid remains constant between input and output.
  - observation: |
      Each number in output is related to corresponding number in input.
  - observation: |
     Adding 1 to input does not get output.
  - observation: |
      The output values "wrap around", indicating a modular arithmetic operation.
  - observation: |
     Adding four (4) and taking Modulo six (6) will yield the correct results.
  - action: |
      Apply a modulo addition operation to each cell in the input grid.
  - action: |
     Add 4.
  - action: |
     take Modulo 6.
