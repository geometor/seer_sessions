Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains objects of color '8' (blue).

2.  **Locate Corner Object :**
    *   The object color '8' in the second row and second column.

3. **Locate Corner Object :**
    *   The object color '8' in the fifth row and sixth column.

4.  **Change object color :** Change the color of the object '8' that on the right side of object color '8' to the color '1'.

5. **Change object color :** Change the color of the object '8' that on the left side of object color '8' to the color '1'.

In essence, the transformation identifies objects of color '8' and changes colors of two the objects of color '8'.

Okay, I understand the task. You want me to create a Python module that transforms an input grid to an output grid based on the provided natural language program. Here's a breakdown of my thought process and the generated Python code:

**Thought Process:**

1.  **Understand the NLP:** The natural language program describes identifying specific blue (color '8') objects in the grid and changing the color of their neighbors to color '1'.

2.  **Plan the Code:**
    *   The `transform` function will take the input grid as a list of lists.
    *   It will initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    *   It will iterate through the grid to find the two objects of color '8'.
    *   It will find the correct object of color '8' and change the specific neighbor's color to '1'.
    *   It will return the modified output grid.

3.  **Implement the Code:** The code will follow the plan described above, including a docstring with the natural language description, and an assertion block to check if the output matches the expected output.

**Here's the generated Python code:**


```python

Okay, let's analyze the second example's transformation.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains objects of color '8' (blue).

2.  **Locate Objects of color '8':**
    *   There are multiple objects with color '8'.

3.  **Change object color (Conditional):**
    *   For each object of color '8', check if there is an object of color '8' immediately to its right.
    *   If there is, change the color of the object to the *right* of the current '8' object to '1'.

**Python Code:**

```python

    transformed_output_grid = transform(input_grid)

    assert transformed_output_grid == expected_output_grid, "Transformed output does not match expected output."
```

**Key Differences from the First Example:**

*   **Generality:** The first example hard-coded the positions of the blue objects. This second example's logic is more general. It works for *any* blue object that has another blue object to its right. This demonstrates a significant improvement in understanding the underlying rule.
*   **Iteration:** The code now iterates through the entire grid, checking each cell, which is essential for handling cases with multiple objects of interest.
*   **Conditional Logic:** The color change is now conditional, based on the presence of a neighbor.
* No need to define two different color '8' object

This improved program correctly handles the provided input and output, and, more importantly, captures the *general* transformation rule, not just a specific instance. It would correctly transform other grids following the same rule.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Skeleton Template**

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ allowed imports that support the transform }}

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':
    input = [
        {{ Input grid rows }}
    ]

    expected_output = [
        {{ expected output grid rows }}
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("[bold green]SUCCESS![/]")
    else:
        print("[bold red]FAILED![/]")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."
