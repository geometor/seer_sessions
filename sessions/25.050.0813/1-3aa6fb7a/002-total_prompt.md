Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids. Here's my breakdown:

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shaped structures, one mirrored."
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shaped structures, one mirrored."
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: "Two single cells that replace one cell of the color 8 shapes"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct L-shaped objects made of azure (color 8) cells.

2.  **Locate Upper-Right and Lower-Left Corners**:
    *   Find the upper-right corner of the top-left L shape.
    *   Find the lower-left corner of the bottom-right L shape.

3.  **Change cell to color 1**:
    *   Replace the upper-right cell with color 1 (blue).
    *   Replace the lower-left cell with color 1 (blue).

4.  **Preserve other parts**: All other cells keep the original colors.

**Transformation Rule Summary**
The input azure L-shapes had their upper-right and lower-left corner pixels changed to blue.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
