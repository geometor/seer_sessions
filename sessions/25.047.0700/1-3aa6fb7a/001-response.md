Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [4, 4], [4, 5], [5, 4]]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 rectangles and two 1x1 squares

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [4, 4], [4, 5], [5, 4]]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 rectangles and two single squares
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [[1,2], [4,4]]
      shape: two single squares
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct azure (color 8) objects:
    *   One is the 1x2 azure object at the top-left side.
    *   Another is the 1x2 azure object is at the bottom-right side.
    *   The other two azure objects are next to each other.

2.  **Change First Object**:
    * The single azure pixel that has no azure neighboors at its right, its left, down, and it is at the top side is changed to a blue pixel.

3. **Change Second Object**:
   *The single azure pixel that has no azure neighboors at its right, its left, up, and it is at the bottom side is changed to a blue pixel.

In summary, the transformation rule identifies isloated azure pixels in L shape figures and converts them to blue. The azure pixels which have azure neighboors at the top, bottom, left and right remains intact.
