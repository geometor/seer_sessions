Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: 'L' shapes and single cells
      position: various, changing between input and output
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cells
      position: appears in output only
  relationships:
    - The azure (8) objects remain unchanged in shape and position mostly.
    - Blue (1) cells appear to be inserted near the azure objects.
  transformations:
    - The azure L shape in the top left corner gains a blue cell adjacent to its corner inner side.
    - One of the single azure cells in the bottom right corner, changes it's neighbor to its left to blue.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects within the grid. These include both the "L" shaped objects and single azure cells.

2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** The positions and shapes of azure colored regions are constants.

3.  **Insert Blue Cell at Top-Left "L":**
    *   Locate the "L" shaped azure object in the top-left corner of the grid (rows 1-2, columns 1-2).
    *   Identify the inner corner cell of this "L" shape (row 1, column 2).
    *   Change the color of the cell immediately to the right from its upmost part of the L shape (row 1, column 3) to blue (color 1).

4.  **Insert Blue Cell at bottom-right "8":**
    *   Locate the azure elements in the bottom right corner.
    *   Select the single azure cell (row 4, column 6)
    *   Change the color of the cell immediately to the left of the selected cell (row 4, column 5) to blue (color 1).

5. **All the other elements of the grid will be 0**

In essence, the transformation preserves the azure objects and inserts blue cells at specific, strategically chosen empty cells which neighbor them. One at the top left corner's L shaped azure region, and one at the isolated azure colored cell at the bottom-right corner.

```python
"""
The transformation preserves the azure (color 8) objects and inserts blue (color 1) cells at specific locations: 
one adjacent to the inner corner of the top-left "L" shaped azure object, and another to the left of a single azure cell in the bottom-right.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
