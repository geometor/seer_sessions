These include both the \"L\" shaped objects and single azure cells.\n\n2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** The positions and shapes of azure colored regions are constants.\n\n3.  **Insert Blue Cell at Top-Left \"L\":**\n    *   Locate the \"L\" shaped azure object in the top-left corner of the grid (rows 1-2, columns 1-2).\n    *   Identify the inner corner cell of this \"L\" shape (row 1, column 2).\n    *   Change the color of the cell immediately to the right from its upmost part of the L shape (row 1, column 3) to blue (color 1).\n\n4.  **Insert Blue Cell at bottom-right \"8\":**\n    *   Locate the azure elements in the bottom right corner.\n    *   Select the single azure cell (row 4, column 6)\n    *   Change the color of the cell immediately to the left of the selected cell (row 4, column 5) to blue (color 1).\n\n5. **All the other elements of the grid will be 0**\n\nIn essence, the transformation preserves the azure objects and inserts blue cells at specific, strategically chosen empty cells which neighbor them. One at the top left corner's L shaped azure region, and one at the isolated azure colored cell at the bottom-right corner.\n"
