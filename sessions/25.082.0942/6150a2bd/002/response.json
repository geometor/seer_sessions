            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis (transpose and then rotate counter-clockwise) is incorrect, as evidenced by the mismatches in both examples. The `pixels_off` count indicates significant differences between the expected and transformed outputs. A new strategy is required, one that thoroughly re-examines the input-output pairs to identify the *actual* transformation rule. We cannot assume it is rotation or a variant of a simple transpose operation, because of the pixel counts.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1. **Discard current hypothesis:** The initial assumption about transposition and rotation is not valid.\n2. **Re-examine examples:** Analyze the input-output pairs of *both* examples, paying close attention to the *positional changes* of individual pixels of specific colors.\n3. **Identify invariant properties:** Are there properties (like color, relative position within a group of similar colors, etc.) that are preserved between the input and output?\n4. **Formulate a new hypothesis:** Based on the re-examination, develop a new natural language program describing the transformation.\n5. **Test thoroughly:** Ensure the new hypothesis holds true for *all* provided examples before coding.\n6. Look for mirroring/flipping, color swapping, and movement of regions, rather than just overall matrix transformation.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (using code execution where necessary):**\n\nSince the provided feedback already includes the pixel differences and size checks, direct code execution isn't needed for *basic* metrics. We already know it fails. We need to qualitatively analyze.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input (3x3):\n        "
