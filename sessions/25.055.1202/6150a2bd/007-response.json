Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9), corresponding to a specific color. The transformation appears to involve a rotation and possibly some color changes, and seems like a mirroring operation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Alternatively, the entire input is diagonally mirrored across the axis going from top left to bottom right.\n\n2.  **Color Preservation/Change:** The colors from the original positions are maintained during the rotation. No new colors added.\n\nIn summary, the transformation is either a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation or a mirror on a diagonal, preserving the original colors in the input grid and placing them into the equivalent positions in the output grid.\n"
