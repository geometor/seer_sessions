Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and the code execution results to understand the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code only focused on determining the dimensions of the input and output grids.  It's clear now that the transformation involves a change in dimensions, but it's not a simple, consistent change (like always halving the dimensions). The relationship between input and output dimensions varies across examples. Also, the output grid retains the color of the input grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Dimensions:** Carefully examine the input and output dimensions for each example to identify a potential pattern or rule governing their relationship.
2.  **Consider Color:** Confirm that the color in the input grid is always preserved in the output grid, regardless of dimension changes.

**Metrics and Observations (YAML):**
```yaml
examples:
  - example_1:
      input_dims: (6, 8)
      output_dims: (8, 6)
      color: azure (8)
      observation: |
        The output dimensions are the inverse of the input dimensions. The single color is maintained.
  - example_2:
      input_dims: (3, 12)
      output_dims: (12, 3)
      color: gray (5)
      observation: |
          The output dimensions are the inverse of the input dimensions. The single color is maintained.
  - example_3:
      input_dims: (8, 11)
      output_dims: (11, 8)
      color: blue (1)
      observation: |
          The output dimensions are the inverse of the input dimensions.  The single color is maintained.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule inverts the dimensions of the input grid, swapping the number of rows and columns, to create the output grid. The color of the input grid is maintained in the output grid.

```
1.  **Invert Dimensions**: Swap the height and width of the input grid. The number of rows in the input becomes the number of columns in the output, and vice-versa.
2.  **Preserve Color**: Ensure all cells of the output grid matches the color of the all cells on the input grid.
