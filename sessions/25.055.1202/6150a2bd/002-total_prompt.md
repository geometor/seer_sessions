## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C4BB3668550>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C4BB3669A80>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The transformation between the input and output grids appears to involve a rotation.  The colors (represented by the digits) seem to be preserved, but their positions within the grid are changed. It is a 90 degree clockwise rotation.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: 3x3 matrix of integers
    properties:
      - rows: 3
      - columns: 3
      - cell_values: integers from 0 to 9
      - colors: represent colors based on a predefined mapping

  - type: transformation
    description: Rotation of the grid
    properties:
      - type: clockwise rotation
      - degrees: 90
      - description: each cell's value in input moved to new location in the output.

  - type: objects
    description: individual cells in the grid
    properties:
       - value: an integer representing color.
       - position: row, column index
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of integers.
2.  **Transformation:** Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise. This means:
    *   The top-left element of the input becomes the top-right element of the output.
    *   The top-center element of the input becomes the right-center element of the output.
    *   The top-right element of the input becomes the bottom-right element of the output.
    *   The center-left element of the input becomes the top-center element of the output.
    *   The center-center element stays at center.
    *   The center-right element of the input becomes the bottom-center element of the output.
    *   The bottom-left element of input becomes top left of output.
    *   The bottom-center element of input becomes the left-center element of output.
    *   The bottom right element of input becomes bottom left of output.
3.  **Output:** The rotated 3x3 grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
