            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was likely based on a very simple transformation (or no transformation at all, given the first two examples). The failures in Examples 3 and 4 clearly demonstrate that the actual transformation rule is more complex and involves some form of object movement or manipulation. The \"success\" flags are the most valuable indicators, as they directly show where the current logic fails. The strategy is to analyze the failed cases, identify the *differences* between input and output, and formulate a rule that explains these differences, refining this rule as more data is analyzed. Since Examples 1 and 2 show identical input and output, there are changes in Examples 3 and 4 only.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations about object properties and actions:\n```\n--- Example 1 ---\nInput Dimensions: (9, 9)\nOutput Dimensions: (9, 9)\nInput Unique Colors: [5]\nOutput Unique Colors: [5]\nInput object count: 1\nOutput object count: 1\n--- Example 2 ---\nInput Dimensions: (10, 10)\nOutput Dimensions: (10, 10)\nInput Unique Colors: [8]\nOutput Unique Colors: [8]\nInput object count: 1\nOutput object count: 1\n--- Example 3 ---\nInput Dimensions: (10, 10)\nOutput Dimensions: (10, 10)\nInput Unique Colors: [0, 5]\nOutput Unique Colors: [0, 5]\nInput object count: 2\nOutput object count: 2\n--- Example 4 ---\nInput Dimensions: (10, 10)\nOutput Dimensions: (10, 10)\nInput Unique Colors: [0, 8]\nOutput Unique Colors: [0, 8]\nInput object count: 2\nOutput object count: 2\n```\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - color: 5\n        shape: rectangle\n        position: full_grid\n    output_objects:\n      - color: 5\n        shape: rectangle\n        position: full_grid\n    transformation: no_change\n    notes: \"The input grid consists of a single gray rectangle filling the entire grid.

Each of these blocks is an object.\n2.  **Find Single Pixel Objects**: From all objects, check if is there any object that consists of only one pixel.\n3.  **Move Single Pixel Objects**:\n   *   If a single-pixel object exists at the bottom-left corner, move it to the top-right corner.\n   *    If a single-pixel object exists at the bottom-right corner, move it to the bottom-left corner.\n4.  **Preserve Other Objects:** All other objects (non-single-pixel objects) remain unchanged in their original positions and colors.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nExamples 1 and 2 don't have any change.\nExample 3 has the bottom-right single white pixel moved to the bottom-left.\nExample 4 has the bottom-left single azure pixel moved to top-right.\nThe other pixels remain the same in all the examples.\n"
