examples:
  - example_1:
      input_dims: (6, 8)
      output_dims: (8, 6)
      color: azure (8)
      observation: |
        The output dimensions are the inverse of the input dimensions. The single color is maintained.
  - example_2:
      input_dims: (3, 12)
      output_dims: (12, 3)
      color: gray (5)
      observation: |
          The output dimensions are the inverse of the input dimensions. The single color is maintained.
  - example_3:
      input_dims: (8, 11)
      output_dims: (11, 8)
      color: blue (1)
      observation: |
          The output dimensions are the inverse of the input dimensions.  The single color is maintained.
