For each row in the input grid:\n\n1. **Locate Gray:** Find the index of the cell with color 5 (gray). If color 5 is not present, the output row is all white (0).\n2. **Check for Blue Before Gray:** Examine the cells to the left of the gray cell in the current input row (cells with indices less than the index of the gray cell). Determine if any of these cells contain color 1 (blue).\n3. **Check for Blue After Gray:** Examine the cells to the right of the gray cell in the current input row (cells with indices greater than the index of the gray cell). Determine if any of these cells contain color 1 (blue).\n4. **Create Output Row:** Initialize a new row for the output grid with 3 cells, all set to color 0 (white).\n5. **Apply Transformation based on Blue's Location:**\n   - If color 1 (blue) is found **before** color 5 (gray) in the input row, set the **middle** cell (index 1) of the output row to color 2 (red).\n   - If color 1 (blue) is found **after** color 5 (gray) in the input row, set the **rightmost** cell (index 2) of the output row to color 2 (red).\n   - If color 1 (blue) is found **both before and after**, or **neither before nor after** color 5, we will prioritize the 'before' condition. If blue is before, set middle to red. If blue is not before but after, set right to red. If blue is neither before nor after (or no gray is found), the output row remains all white (0).\n6. **Construct Output Grid:** Repeat steps 1-5 for each row of the input grid. Stack the resulting output rows to form the complete output grid. The output grid will always have 3 columns.\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\n"
