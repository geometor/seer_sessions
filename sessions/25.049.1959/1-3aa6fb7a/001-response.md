Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (1,1) # Top-left cell of the object
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (3,4) # Top-left cell of the object
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (1,1)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (1,2)
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (3,4)
     - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (4,5)
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Detect Change:** One cell of color 1 (blue) has been added, connected to the top right side, to each of the L-shaped object of the input.

3. **Transformation Rule:** It fills with color 1 the cell at north-east position, considering the most western cell of each azure shape.
