Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid seems to be mostly filled with yellow (4) pixels, with a few blue (1) and orange (7) pixels scattered within. The output grid appears to extract and consolidate these non-yellow pixels, while maintaining their relative horizontal and vertical positioning. The output grid is significantly smaller.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable  # Input and output grids have different dimensions
      elements: pixels
      colors: [yellow, blue, orange]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        yellow: 4
        blue: 1
        orange: 7

actions:
  - name: extract
    description: Identify and select non-yellow pixels.
  - name: condense
    description: Arrange the extracted pixels into a smaller grid, preserving relative positions.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Relative horizontal and vertical positions of non-yellow pixels are maintained during extraction.
  - type: containment
    description: input grid contains all the non-yellow pixels present in the output grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Scan the input grid and identify all pixels that are *not* yellow (color 4). These are the target pixels.
2.  **Extract and Record Positions:** For each target pixel, record its color and its original row and column position within the input grid.
3. Determine new position in output grid: Determine the maximum row and maxiumn colum the target pixels occur at, and compress the target cells down to origin (0,0)
4. **Create Output Grid and fill target cells:** create a new grid, fill the identified target cells with their recorded color.
5.  **Populate Output Grid:** Fill any remaining values of the output grid with the background yellow color (4).

Essentially, the program extracts the "interesting" pixels (non-yellow) and creates a condensed representation of their arrangement, all other cells will default to 4.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
