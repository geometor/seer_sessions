The input grid appears to be mostly filled with the value '3' (green), with a few other colors appearing sporadically. The output grid seems to extract or represent a condensed version of the input, retaining only certain colors and their spatial relationships, specifically a 5x5 square. It's notable how much smaller the output is.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Notice that the output corresponds to the smallest bounding box of the non green values plus one green value padding on all sides.\n\n2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Extract a 5x5 sub-grid from the input grid, positioned to maintain relative placements of non-green colors. The extracted subgrid contains only non green and the color green (3).\n\n3. **Output Sub-Grid:** output the extracted 5 x 5 subgrid.\n\nIn summary the input grid reduces to just the non-green elements within a bounding, square, sub-grid with green (3) padding.\n"
