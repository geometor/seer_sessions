The input grid contains three distinct colors (represented by the numbers 1, 3, and 8). The output grid also contains these same three colors, arranged in a specific pattern centered around the value '1'. The background of the input grid is '1' (blue). There are two instances of '8' (azure) in the top half of the grid and a cross shape of '3'(green) in the lower middle part. The output 3x3 grid seems to capture a zoomed in or abstracted view of certain elements.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

In this example, blue is the background, so, the key colors are blue(1), azure(8) and green(3).\n2.  **Find Central Region:** Locate a 3x3 region in the input grid centered on a blue pixel.\n3. **Locate Critical Pixel**: Find the blue(1) pixel in the input that is adjacent to an azure(8) and a green(3). The definition of adjacent is being directly above, below, left, or right. It may be helpful to search for the azure and green pixels, then search among their blue neighbors.\n4.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the 3x3 subgrid centered at the critical pixel identified in the previous step.\n5.  **Output Subgrid** Return the extracted subgrid, which is the final output.\n\n"
