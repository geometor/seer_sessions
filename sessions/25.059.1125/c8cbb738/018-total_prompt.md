Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to improve the natural language program and, consequently, the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was designed to extract non-yellow pixels and arrange them in a smaller grid, preserving relative positions. This approach works for the first example but fails on others. The primary issue seems to be an oversimplification of the transformation rule. The code assumes *all* non-yellow pixels are to be extracted and repositioned, which is not universally true across all examples.  The other examples have additional constraints or different extraction criteria. Therefore, the strategy should be:

1. **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine the input-output pairs of *all* training examples, not just the first.
2. **Identify the True Rule:**  Determine the *actual* rule governing which pixels are selected and how they're repositioned. This may involve identifying patterns, object interactions, or implicit rules not captured in the initial assessment.
3. **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the observed transformation, incorporating any discovered nuances.
4. **Modify the Code:** Adjust the Python code to implement the revised natural language program.

**Example Metrics and Analysis (using code_execution where necessary)**

Let's analyze each example, recording observations. Since I don't have `code_execution` capabilities here, I'll manually perform the equivalent analysis and provide my observations. I will use `<...>` to indicate where code execution would ideally fill in dynamic information, assuming a hypothetical `code_execution` capability.

**Example 1:**

*   Input: `[[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]`
*   Expected Output: `[[1]]`
*   Actual Output: `[[1]]`
*   Analysis: The code correctly extracts the single blue (1) pixel.  The initial algorithm works.

**Example 2:**

*   Input:
    ```
    [[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]
    ```
*   Expected Output:
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
     [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   Actual Output:
    ```
     [[4, 4, 1],
      [1, 4, 4]]
    ```

*   Analysis: The code *incorrectly* extracts both blue pixels and places them relative to each other. The expected output has a black (0) background, not yellow. The blue pixels maintain their *original* column positions, but the rows are "shifted" so the topmost blue pixel is on the first row. It seems there is no reduction and relative positions are not the consideration, but instead a copy of the area delimited by the extents of the blue pixels in the original grid.

**Example 3:**

*   Input:
    ```
    [[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]
    ```
*   Expected Output:
    ```
     [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   Actual Output:
    ```
    [[4, 4, 1],
     [1, 4, 4]]
    ```
*   Analysis: Similar to Example 2, the code fails. The blue pixels in the expected output maintain their original column position, and the rows are adjusted so the top-most pixel is at row 0. A black background is used. It seems there is no reduction and relative positions are not the consideration, but instead a copy of the area delimited by the extents of the blue pixels in the original grid.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: blue_pixels
    properties:
      color: 1
      role: target_pixels
    actions:
      - name: identify_extents
        description: Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by blue pixels.
      - name: copy_subgrid
        description: Copy the rectangular region of the input grid defined by the extents of the blue pixels.

  - object: background
    properties:
        color: 0 # appears to be black
        role: fill_color
    actions:
        - name: default_fill
          description: fill empty spaces in the copied region with color 0

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all blue (value 1) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices among the identified blue pixels. This defines a rectangular "bounding box" around all the blue pixels.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with dimensions equal to the bounding box calculated in step 2, with background filled by black (0).
4. **Copy Subgrid:** Copy the values from the subgrid defined by the bounding box to the output grid, using the color black (0) to replace any yellow (4) pixels.

This revised natural language program captures the core logic observed across all training examples: finding a region defined by blue pixels and copying that region to a new grid. The background colour is now an explicit part of the transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
