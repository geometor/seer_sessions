    [[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]
    ```
*   Expected Output:
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
     [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   Actual Output:
    ```
     [[4, 4, 1],
      [1, 4, 4]]
    ```

*   Analysis: The code *incorrectly* extracts both blue pixels and places them relative to each other. The expected output has a black (0) background, not yellow. The blue pixels maintain their *original* column positions, but the rows are "shifted" so the topmost blue pixel is on the first row. It seems there is no reduction and relative positions are not the consideration, but instead a copy of the area delimited by the extents of the blue pixels in the original grid.

**Example 3:**

*   Input:
    ```
    [[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]
    ```
*   Expected Output:
    ```
     [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   Actual Output:
    ```
    [[4, 4, 1],
     [1, 4, 4]]
    ```
*   Analysis: Similar to Example 2, the code fails. The blue pixels in the expected output maintain their original column position, and the rows are adjusted so the top-most pixel is at row 0. A black background is used. It seems there is no reduction and relative positions are not the consideration, but instead a copy of the area delimited by the extents of the blue pixels in the original grid.
