            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code captured some key aspects of the transformation, particularly the identification and relocation of the 2x2 block. However, the \"Top Reflection\" and \"Bottom Replication\" rules were not generalized correctly, leading to errors in other training examples. The strategy to resolve these is as follows:\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* training examples, not just the first one, to identify the *consistent* transformation rules. The current code overfits to the first example.\n2.  **Generalize Rules:** Instead of hardcoding specific coordinates (like the second column of the second row), look for *relative* positions and patterns that hold true across all examples.\n3.  **Focus on the 2x2 Block:** The 2x2 block seems to be the primary object of interest. The transformations appear to be defined in relation to this block's position and contents.\n4. **Object Identification:** It's less that single pixels of the grid are \"objects\" and more important that the code find and move the identified 2x2 block.\n5. **YAML and Program Refinement:**\n  - the YAML block will record consistent observations that holds across all tasks\n  - the natural language program, will describe a more robust and general transformation rule.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo get accurate metrics, I'll describe what *should* happen based on a correct understanding of the transformation, and contrast that with what the *current code* produces. I cannot use `code_execution` myself. Instead, I must carefully inspect the output produced by the code and mentally compare it to the given output examples.\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including an assessment and yaml fragments to highlight the key observations.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** 6x5 grid with a 2x2 block of `[4, 6], [2, 0]`\n*   **Expected Output:**  The 2x2 block remains. Top row: `[6, 0, 0, 2, 2]`. Bottom rows: two rows of `[6, 4, 0, 0, 0]`\n*   **Code Output:** Correct.\n* **Assessment:** The initial code worked correctly for this case, but this was by chance due to overfitting.\n* **Key Observation** The 6 in the upper right of the 2x2 block occupies [0][0] and the value 2, in the lower left of the 2x2 block, appears twice in the last two positions of the first row.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** 8x7 grid with a 2x2 block of `[7, 1], [1, 8]`\n*   **Expected Output:** The 2x2 block remains. The first row should contain [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], and two duplicated, mirrored rows below the 2x2, that begin two rows down.\n*   **Code Output:** Incorrect. The top reflection incorrectly places 7 in the first position of the top row, instead of 1. It does place two 1s correctly. The bottom reflection is also incorrect as the offset seems incorrect, placing the mirrored row too low.\n* **Assessment:** Highlights the incorrect generalization of the \"top reflection\" and \"bottom reflection\" rules.  The upper-right value of the 2x2 block consistently populates [0][0]. The lower-left value of the 2x2 block is duplicated at the end of the first row.\n*   **Key Observation:** The top-right value of the 2x2 block goes to output\\[0,0]. The bottom-left pixel of the 2x2 block is *duplicated* at the *end* of the first row.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:** 9x9 grid with a 2x2 block of `[8, 5], [3, 7]`\n*   **Expected Output:** 2x2 block remains. Top row should be: \\[5,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3]. Bottom rows should be two rows of: \\[5,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n*   **Code Output:** Incorrect. Similar errors to Example 2, with incorrect values in the top and bottom reflections due to using absolute positions instead of relative ones.\n* **Assessment:**  Confirms that the top and bottom reflection logic is flawed and needs to be based on the 2x2 block's properties.\n* **Key Observation:** Reinforces observations from Example 2.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts)**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: \"2x2 block\"\n    properties:\n      - description: \"A contiguous 2x2 block of non-zero pixels.\"\n        invariants:\n          - \"The 2x2 block's position in the output grid is identical to its position in the input grid.\"\n    actions:\n      - description: \"Top Reflection\"\n        details: \"The value of the top-right pixel of the 2x2 block is placed in the top-left corner (0,0) of the output grid. The value of the bottom-left pixel of the 2x2 block is duplicated at the end of the first row of the output grid.\"\n      - description: \"Bottom Replication and Mirroring\"\n        details: \"The top row of the 2x2 block is mirrored.  Two copies of this mirrored row are placed in the output grid, starting two rows below the bottom of the 2x2 block.\"\n      - description: \"Padding\"\n        details: \"All other cells in the output grid are filled with 0 (black).\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify the 2x2 Block:** Locate the contiguous 2x2 block of non-zero pixels within the input grid.\n\n2.  **Preserve 2x2 Block:** Copy the 2x2 block from the input grid to the *exact same position* in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Top Reflection:**\n    *   Place the value of the top-right pixel of the 2x2 block into the top-left cell (0, 0) of the output grid.\n    *   Place two copies of the bottom-left pixel of the 2x2 block at the *end* of the first row of the output grid.\n\n4.  **Bottom Replication:**\n    *   Mirror the top row of the 2x2 block (e.g., \\[a, b] becomes \\[b, a]).\n    *   Starting *two rows below* the bottom edge of the 2x2 block, place the mirrored row.\n    *   Repeat the mirrored row *again* in the row immediately below.\n\n5.  **Padding:** Fill all other cells in the output grid with 0 (black).\n"
