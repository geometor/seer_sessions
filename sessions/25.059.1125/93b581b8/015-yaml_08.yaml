facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: pixels (integers 0-9)
  - object: central_block
    type: subgrid
    dimensions: 2x2
    location: input (rows 3-4, cols 3-4)
  - observation: output contains mirrored copies of the non-zero values
  - observation: colors in central block of input are preserved
  - action: reflection/mirroring
    details: Non-zero values around center are mirrored in output. Top left corner in output matches the bottom right of the 2x2 core, top right corner matches the value from the bottom left of the central 2x2 core, and bottom corners of the output grid match the top corners of the 2x2 core of the input.
