Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 6x6 grid of pixels, each represented by a single digit integer (0-9). These digits correspond to different colors. The input grid appears to have a 2x2 block of non-zero pixels in the center, surrounded by zero-value pixels (white). The output grid seems to have a mirrored or reflected structure relative to the input. There are repeated colors. The central non-zero pixels are preserved.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: pixels (integers 0-9)
  - object: central_block
    type: subgrid
    dimensions: 2x2
    location: input (rows 3-4, cols 3-4)
  - observation: output contains mirrored copies of the non-zero values
  - observation: colors in central block of input are preserved
  - action: reflection/mirroring
    details: Non-zero values around center are mirrored in output. Top left corner in output matches the bottom right of the 2x2 core, top right corner matches the value from the bottom left of the central 2x2 core, and bottom corners of the output grid match the top corners of the 2x2 core of the input.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Core:** Locate the 2x2 block of non-zero pixels in the center of the input grid (rows 3-4, columns 3-4).
2.  **Preserve the Core**: Copy the 2x2 core block from the input to the identical location of the output grid
3.  **Mirror Top-Left:** Identify the colors represented by the value in the bottom right of the 2x2 core. Mirror these values to the top-left 2x2 corner of the output grid.
4.  **Mirror Top-Right:** Identify the colors represented by the value in the bottom left of the 2x2 core. Mirror these values to the top-right 2x2 corner of the output grid.
5.  **Mirror Bottom-Left:** Identify the colors represented by the values at the top right of the 2x2 core. Mirror these values to the bottom-left 2x2 corner of the output grid.
6.  **Mirror Bottom-Right:** Identify the colors represented by the values in the top left of the 2x2 core. Mirror these values to the bottom-right 2x2 corner of the output grid.
7. **Fill Remaining:** Keep all other cells in the output grid as 0 (white).
