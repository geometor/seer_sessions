Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception:**

The core transformation seems to involve a mirroring and expansion/duplication of a 2x2 colored block within the input grid. The non-zero pixels in the input appear to define a 2x2 core. This core is then duplicated in a specific pattern, sometimes diagonally, and other times in reflected ways. The position, orientation and original 2x2 seem to be the key.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: core_block
    type: 2x2 grid
    properties:
      - colors: [list of 4 integers, representing colors]
      - location: [top-left coordinates (row, col)]

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [same as input grid]

actions:
  - name: find_core
    description: Identify the 2x2 block of non-zero pixels.
  - name: duplicate_reflect
    description: Duplicate and reflect/place portions of the core block according to rules defined by the spatial properties of the 2x2.

relationships:
  - core_block *is_part_of* input_grid
  - output_grid *is_derived_from* input_grid *by_applying* actions
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the Core:** Locate the 2x2 block of non-zero pixels within the input grid. This is the "core block". Note the colors and the top-left coordinates of this block.

2. **Mirror/Duplicate:**
   - examine the values in clockwise fashion starting at the top right.
   - top-right value is duplicated in top-left 2x2 of the output
   - bottom-right value is duplicated in top-right 2x2 of the output
   - bottom-left value is duplicated in bottom-right 2x2 of the output
   - top-left value is duplicated in bottom-left 2x2 of the output

3. **Fill Remaining Cells:** Fill all other cells in the output grid with 0 (white/background).

In short, the input is turned inside out with respect to the core 2 x 2.
