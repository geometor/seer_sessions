The primary elements are:\n\n*   **Background:** The majority of the grid consists of '0' pixels, which appear to represent a white or empty background.\n*   **Colored Objects:** There are non-zero pixels, forming contiguous blocks of color (9, 3, 7, and 8 in the input). These appear to be the primary \"objects\" of interest.\n* **Object Arrangement.** The arrangement of the objects is that they are touching and they are 2 x 2.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
