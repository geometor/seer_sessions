Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the 2x2 Block:** Locate the contiguous 2x2 block of non-zero pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Preserve 2x2 Block:** Copy the 2x2 block from the input grid to the *exact same position* in the output grid.

3.  **Top Reflection:**
    *   Place the value of the top-right pixel of the 2x2 block into the top-left cell (0, 0) of the output grid.
    *   Place two copies of the bottom-left pixel of the 2x2 block at the *end* of the first row of the output grid.

4.  **Bottom Replication:**
    *   Mirror the top row of the 2x2 block (e.g., [a, b] becomes [b, a]).
    *   Starting *two rows below* the bottom edge of the 2x2 block, place the mirrored row.
    *   Repeat the mirrored row *again* in the row immediately below.

5.  **Padding:** Fill all other cells in the output grid with 0 (black).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
