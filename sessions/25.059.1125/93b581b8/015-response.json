These digits correspond to different colors. The input grid appears to have a 2x2 block of non-zero pixels in the center, surrounded by zero-value pixels (white). The output grid seems to have a mirrored or reflected structure relative to the input. There are repeated colors. The central non-zero pixels are preserved.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
