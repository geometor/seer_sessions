Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the input grid into contiguous color regions. A region is defined as a group of adjacent pixels of the same color.
2.  **Locate Key Regions:**
    * Find the region that occupies the majority of the top and/or left portion.
    * Find the region that occupies the center-right vertically.
3.  **Sample Colors:**
    * Sample the color from the bottom-right corner of the "top/left" region, use black (0) if this is the green (3) region.
    * Sample the color from the bottom-right corner of the "middle-right" region.
    * If there is a region that spans the bottom left, sample that.
4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
    *   Place the sampled color from the top/left at the top-left (0, 0).
    *   Place the sample color from the middle-right to the top-right (0,1) and span 2 columns.
    *   If the bottom-left sample exists, put this at (2,0)

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and devise a plan to improve the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on observations from the first training example. It seems the core idea of identifying regions and sampling colors from them is partially correct. However, the assumptions about which regions to focus on (top/left, middle/right, bottom/left) and how to construct the output grid (specifically, the 3x3 size and fixed positions) are not universally applicable to all examples. The code fails to correctly transform some examples, indicating that the logic needs refinement and generalization. The strategy should involve:

1.  **Re-evaluating Region Selection:** Instead of fixed positional assumptions (top/left, middle/right), we should explore more flexible criteria for identifying relevant regions. This might involve considering region size, shape, relative position, or other distinguishing features.
2.  **Dynamic Output Grid Construction:** The output grid size and structure should be determined dynamically based on the input, rather than being fixed at 3x3.
3.  **Conditional Logic:** Introduce more conditional logic to handle variations in the input grids. The current code has limited conditional branches (e.g., checking if `top_left_color` is 3).

**Example and Results Metrics:**

To better understand the errors, let's collect some data about each input-output pair and the code's output.

```python
import numpy as np

def code_execution(input_grid, expected_output, transform_func):
    """Executes the transform function and compares the result with the expected output."""
    actual_output = transform_func(input_grid)
    comparison = np.array_equal(actual_output, np.array(expected_output))
    return actual_output, comparison

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the input grid into contiguous rectangular color regions.
2. **Determine Key Regions**:
    *  Find the region that occupies the majority of the top and/or left area, or most of the entire grid (Region 1).
    *  Find a second region that is distinct from the first (Region 2). Consider regions adjacent to the first region either to the right, bottom, or bottom-right.
    *  Find a third region, if exists, that is different from other regions and spans the bottom. (Region 3)
3.  **Sample Colors:**
    *   From Region 1, sample the color at its bottom-right corner. If Region 1 is green (3), the sampled color is black (0).
    *   From Region 2, sample the color at its bottom-right corner.
    *   From Region 3, sample the color at its bottom-right corner.
4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
    *   Place the sampled color from Region 1 at the top-left cell (0, 0).
    *   Place the sampled color from Region 2 at the top-right, spanning two columns (cells (0, 1) and (0, 2)), and also the row below (cells (1,1) and (1,2)).
    *  If Region 3 exists, place the sampled color from Region 3 at the bottom-left cell (2, 0).

Key changes and considerations in the revised program:

*   **Region Identification:** More flexible wording for Region 1 and Region 2, considering adjacency. Explicitly mention Region 3 spanning the bottom.
*   **Special Rule:** The green (3) to black (0) rule is now part of the "Sample Colors" step.
*   **Output Construction:** Clarified the spanning of the second sample across two columns and 2 rows.
*   **Missing logic:** There is still no logic to determine which of several regions should be region 2.
*   **Size:** The input is always 11 x 11, the output is not always 3 x 3. This needs to be addressed in later iterations.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
