The input grid appears to contain distinct rectangular blocks of color. The output grid seems to be a highly abstracted representation of the input, retaining only certain colors and possibly their relative positions, but greatly reduced in size and with many elements seemingly discarded. The colors in the output are all present in the input, so the task focuses on extraction and relayout, as opposed to generation of new information.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

The essence of the transformation is to reduce the grid and represent the existence and relative positions of prominent color blocks.\n"
