Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program identifies 4x4 blocks of green (3) pixels within the input grid. 
The presence of red (2) pixels is not relevant.
For each identified green block, the value of the top-left pixel of each block is placed into a smaller 4x4 output grid. 
The position of the green block in the input grid determines the position of the corresponding pixel in the output grid, divided into quadrants.
If no green block is present in a quadrant, a white (0) pixel is placed in the output grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying 4x4 green blocks and mapping their top-left corner to a quadrant in the output grid. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this approach is incorrect or, at best, incomplete. The presence of the 4x4 green blocks is not the correct object. We should re-examine our assumptions. It does appear that relative position *is* an aspect, but perhaps not a quadrant.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** We need to move away from the "4x4 green block" concept and look for alternative patterns. Specifically, the size and color constraints of that assumption.
2.  **Focus on Relative Positioning:** The idea of relative positioning (like the quadrant concept) seems relevant, but the exact mechanism needs refinement.
3.  **Consider All Examples:** The updated natural language program must account for all training examples, not just the first one.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** We'll likely need to go through a few iterations of observation, hypothesis formation, code modification, and testing.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To gather more concrete information, let's analyze each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 15 x 22
    *   Output Shape: 4 x 4
    *   Expected Output vs. Actual Output: Match
    *   Notes: The original hypothesis works for this case.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 23 x 23
    *   Output Shape: 4 x 4
    *   Expected Output vs. Actual Output: Mismatch. Actual output is all zeros.
    *   Notes: No 4x4 green blocks are present. Highlights the flaw in the initial assumption.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 23 x 23
    *   Output Shape: 4 x 4
    *   Expected Output vs. Actual Output: Mismatch. Actual output is all zeros.
    *   Notes: Similar to Example 2, no 4x4 green blocks.

Let's look at the grids for the second example:

It appears that 2x2 green blocks are being detected, and the top-left pixel is being mapped. The input grid is being divided, but not necessarily into quadrants.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: green_block
    color: green
    size: dynamic  # Size is not fixed at 4x4
    shape: rectangle
    min_size: 2x2 # minimum size from examples

  - name: output_grid
    size: 4x4
    shape: rectangle

actions:
  - name: map_block
    input: green_block
    output: output_grid
    description: >
      Maps a green block from the input grid to the output grid.
      The top-left pixel of the green block is used.
      The position in the output grid is determined by the relative position of the
      green block in the input grid. It appears to divide the input into 2x2 sections.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Blocks:** Scan the input grid to identify rectangular blocks of green (3) pixels. The minimum size of these blocks is 2x2.
2.  **Determine Relative Position:** Divide the input grid conceptually into four equal sections, creating a 2x2 layout of sections (not necessarily quadrants based on the center, but partitions of the height and width).
3. **Map to Output:** For each identified green block, extract the value of its top-left pixel. Place this value in the output grid at the position corresponding to the section the green block's top-left pixel falls within. For example, if a block falls within the upper-left partition of input, its pixel value should be placed in output at [0,0]. The input appears to be partitioned at height / 2 and width / 2
4.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is always 4x4. If no green blocks are found in an input partition, the corresponding output cell should be 0 (white).

The key difference from the previous program is the focus on *any* green blocks of at least 2x2, not just 4x4 blocks, and the use of input partitions (divided by height/2 and width/2) rather than strict quadrants. The top-left pixel of each detected block provides the value, placed in the output cell according to the relative position of the section.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
