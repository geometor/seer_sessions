relationships:
  - type: spatial_compression
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: The output grid represents a compressed version of the input grid.

  - type: contains
    from: input_grid
    to: green_blocks, red_blocks

  - type: positional_mapping
    from: green_blocks (in input_grid)
    to: green_pixels (in output_grid)
    description: The position of a 4 x 4 green block relative to other like groups of green boxes in the input grid corresponds to the location of a green pixel in the output grid.

actions:
   - type: select
     agent: unknown
     target: the top-left pixel value of 4 x 4 green blocks within red borders in input grid.
     result: used in ouput grid

   - type: condense
     agent: unknown
     target: selected values
     result: create output grid based on locations of groups of four green blocks.
