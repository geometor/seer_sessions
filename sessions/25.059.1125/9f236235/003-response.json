Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input is a large grid (19x19) of colored pixels, primarily green (3), red (2), and white (0).\n*   The output is a much smaller grid (4x4) containing only green (3) and white (0) pixels.\n*   It seems like the output is a condensed or summarized version of the input.\n*   Visually, the input grid appears to have repeating sections of green and red bordered by lines of other red pixels. These sections make up the body of the output grid.\n*    There's a strong correspondence between 4x4 blocks of green pixels within larger structures in the input, and the position of green pixels in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Each green block in the input corresponds to a single pixel in the output. The relative positions of the green blocks (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) correspond to the positions of the pixels in the output grid. Specifically, the locations of those groups translate to the exact cell location in the output grid (e.g. the first \"top-left-most\" group is the top-left cell of the output, and so on.\n\n5. If no green block, insert a white pixel in the ouput grid.\n\nIn simpler terms, the program finds the 4x4 green squares within the input, notes each position relative to the other squares, and creates a smaller output grid where each green square's upper-left pixel value is represented by a single pixel in the corresponding location.\n"
