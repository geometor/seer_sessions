The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid and seems to contain only a few of the colors present in the input, arranged in a specific configuration. The position and relative configuration seem important. It appears we are identifying sub-grids within the input. The red lines seem to divide background.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
