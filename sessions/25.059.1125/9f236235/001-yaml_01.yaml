    description: Identifies and extracts a specific subgrid based on color and position.

  - action: detect_background
    input: input_grid
    output: set of background cells.
    description: "identifies white and colored lines that form a grid structure, which will then identify subgrids."

  - action: determine_subgrid_corner_colors
     input: background_grid
     output: set of colors
     description: each subgrid within the identified background contains a unique colored pixel in upper left corner, with possibly other pixels of this color within the subgrid.
