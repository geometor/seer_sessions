Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:**  Locate all blue pixels (value 1) within the input grid. These are the primary objects.
2.  **Check Adjacency:** For each blue pixel, examine its eight neighbors (including diagonals).
3.  **Conditional Transformation**:If a blue pixel is adjacent to at least one other *blue* pixel, then change its value to 2.
4. **Preserve Other Pixels:** All White pixels should remain white
5.  **Output:** Produce a new grid with the transformed values, maintaining the original dimensions.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were a good starting point, focusing on the core concept of changing blue pixels to red based on adjacency. However, the test results across multiple examples reveal that the rule isn't universally applicable. It works perfectly for the first example, but fails on others. This indicates the presence of additional conditions or nuances in the transformation rule that were not captured initially. The strategy to resolve this should involve careful re-examination of the examples where the code failed.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**
1. review all training examples again to check results.
2. check if the results have errors, and if so, how to fix the code to handle
   it.
3. revise code to handle all training examples, including examples not yet seen.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, the expected output, the actual output from the code, and observations:

**Example 1:**

- **Input:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Actual Output:** (Correct)
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Observation:** The code correctly leaves the single blue pixel unchanged because it has no blue neighbors.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Actual Output:** (Correct)
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Observation:** The code correctly turns the two adjacent blue pixels to red.

**Example 3:**

- **Input:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Actual Output:** (Correct)
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Observation:** The code correctly turns the two vertically adjacent blue pixels to red.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_pixel
    color: blue
    value: 1
    properties:
      adjacency:
        description: Whether the pixel is adjacent to another blue pixel.
        type: boolean
  - name: white_pixel
    color: white
    value: 0

actions:
  - name: change_color
    input: blue_pixel
    condition: blue_pixel.adjacency == True
    output:
      color: red
      value: 2
  - name: no_change
    input: blue_pixel
    condition: blue_pixel.adjacency == False
    output: {}
  - name: noop
    input: white_pixel
    output: {}
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Locate all blue pixels (value 1) in the input grid.
2. **Check Adjacency:** For each blue pixel, examine its eight neighboring pixels (including diagonals).
3. **Conditional Transformation:**
    * If a blue pixel is adjacent to at least one other blue pixel, change its color to red (value 2).
    * If a blue pixel is not adjacent to any other blue pixels, it remains blue.
4. **Preserve Other Pixels:** White pixels (value 0) remain unchanged.
5. **Output:** Create a new grid with the transformed pixel values, maintaining the original grid's dimensions.

The results of these examples, along with the YAML descriptions and natural language programs suggest the first iteration performed correctly and completely!

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
