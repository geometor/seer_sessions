The primary colors observed are blue (1) and white (0) in the input grids, and blue (1), red (2), and white (0) in the output grids. The transformation seems to involve changing some of the blue pixels to red based on their neighbors. The consistent elements seem to be groups of blue pixels, and transformation only impacts those.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
