The primary change appears to be the modification of specific pixels that were originally blue (value 1) in the input, changing them to red (value 2) in the output. Other pixels seem to remain unchanged. The spatial arrangement of the grid and the pixels remains consistent.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
