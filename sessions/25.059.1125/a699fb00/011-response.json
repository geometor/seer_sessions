            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided code and results, along with a refined natural language program and supporting YAML documentation:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies blue pixels and attempts to change adjacent white (0) pixels to the right to red (2). However, it only considers the immediate right neighbor. The provided examples reveal that the transformation extends to *all* contiguous white pixels to the right of a blue pixel, not just the single adjacent one. My strategy will be to modify the code to iteratively check and change white pixels to the right until a non-white pixel or the grid boundary is encountered.\n\n**Example and Results Analysis:**\n\nTo perform quantitative analysis, use the `code_execution` tool to verify these\nresults:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input: 3x3, one blue pixel, two white pixels to the right. Output: All white pixels to the right of the blue one become red. *Result: Correct.*\n*   **Example 2:** Input: 5x5, multiple blue pixels, some with white pixels to the right. Output: All white pixels to the right of any blue pixel become red. *Result: Incorrect.* The code only changes one white. It stops after finding the first one.\n*   **Example 3:** Input: 7x7, various blue pixels, some with white pixels, some without. Output: All *contiguous* white pixels to the right of blue ones become red. *Result: Incorrect*. Same problem as example 2.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: blue_pixel\n    properties:\n      color: blue (1)\n      role: initiator\n      description: Triggers the color change of adjacent white pixels.\n  - object: white_pixel\n    properties:\n      color: white (0)\n      role: target\n      description: Changes color to red if to the right of a blue pixel.\n      constraints: Must be contiguously to the right of the blue pixel.\n  - object: changed_pixel\n    properties:\n      color: red(2)\n      role: result\n      description: a white pixel that was changed.\n  - action: color_change\n    input:  blue_pixel, white_pixel\n    output: red_pixel\n    description: >-\n      Changes all contiguous white pixels (0) immediately to the right of a\n      blue pixel (1) to red (2). Continues until a non-white pixel or the edge of the grid is reached.\n    precondition: white_pixel must be to the right of blue_pixel\n    postcondition: white_pixels to the right of blue_pixel becomes red_pixel\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find Blue Pixels:** Iterate through the input grid, identifying all pixels with the color blue (value 1).\n2.  **Iterate to the Right:** For each blue pixel found:\n    *   Start at the position immediately to its right.\n    *   While the current position is within the grid boundaries and the pixel color is white (0):\n        *   Change the pixel's color to red (2).\n        *   Move one position to the right.\n3. Return the modified grid.\n"
