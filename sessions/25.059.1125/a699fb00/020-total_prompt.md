Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Objects:**  Locate all blue pixels (value 1) in the input grid.
2. **Check Adjacency:** For each blue pixel, examine its eight neighboring pixels (including diagonals).
3. **Conditional Transformation:**
    * If a blue pixel is adjacent to at least one other blue pixel, change its color to red (value 2).
    * If a blue pixel is not adjacent to any other blue pixels, it remains blue.
4. **Preserve Other Pixels:** White pixels (value 0) remain unchanged.
5. **Output:** Create a new grid with the transformed pixel values, maintaining the original grid's dimensions.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved changing isolated blue pixels to red. However, the subsequent examples reveal a flaw in this logic: the code incorrectly changes *all* blue pixels adjacent to *any* other blue pixel to red, regardless of how many blue pixels are adjacent to each other. The core issue lies in the oversimplification of the adjacency rule. It doesn't account for situations where a blue object extends or contains clusters, only checking if *any* blue neighbor exists.  We need a more nuanced approach.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** The primary assumption that blue pixels adjacent to other blue pixels *always* turn red is incorrect.
2.  **Focus on Connectivity:** The provided information highlights that we should determine if a blue pixel is 'isolated' by checking all of it's neighbors for the same color.
3. **Refine Adjacency Rule:** Instead of simply checking for *any* blue neighbor, differentiate the two conditions.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated logic against all training examples and iterate if necessary.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To better understand the results, let's look at a breakdown of each training example. I'll use the term "isolated blue" to refer to the correct output, meaning they are NOT adjacent to other blue cells.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Single isolated blue pixel.
    *   Expected Output: Single isolated blue pixel.
    *   Actual Output: Single isolated blue pixel.
    *   Result: **Correct**. The initial logic correctly identifies the single blue pixel and transforms it, but it also transforms clustered pixels the same way.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Two horizontally adjacent blue pixels.
    *   Expected Output: Two horizontally adjacent blue pixels.
    *   Actual Output: Two horizontally adjacent blue pixels
    *   Result: **Correct.** Because the blue pixels have blue neighbors, they remain the same.

*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input: A 2x2 block of blue pixels, and a single isolated blue pixel
    *    Expected Output: A 2x2 block of blue pixels, and a single isolated blue pixel.
    *    Actual output: A 2x2 block of blue pixels, and a single isolated blue pixel.
    *    Result: **Correct.**

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: blue_pixel
    properties:
      color: blue
      adjacency:
        description: Can be isolated (no adjacent blue pixels) or connected (adjacent to one or more blue pixels).
        types:
          isolated:
            change: no change
          connected:
            change: no change
  - object: white_pixel
    properties:
      color: white
    interaction:
      description: White pixels do not interact with blue pixels or affect the transformation.
      change: None

transformation_rule: |
  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
    If a pixel is blue, determine if it is isolated by searching for other blue pixels in the eight adjacent cells.
        if a pixel is isolated, it should remain blue.
    If a pixel is blue and is connected, it should also remain blue.
    All other pixels should remain the same.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** For each pixel, check if its color is blue (value 1).
3.  **Check for isolation:** If a pixel is blue, check its eight neighboring pixels (including diagonals).
    * Count how many of these neighbors, $n$, are also blue, where 0 <= $n$ <= 8
4.  **Conditional Transformation:**
    *   If the pixel is blue and n == 0, keep the pixel as blue
    *   If the pixel is blue and n > 0, keep the pixel as blue
5.  **Preserve Other Colors:** If a pixel is not blue, its color remains unchanged.
6.  **Output:** Create a new grid (output grid) with the same dimensions as the input grid, containing the transformed pixel values.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
