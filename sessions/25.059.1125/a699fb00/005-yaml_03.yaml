facts:
  - observation: |
      All examples involve blue (1) and red (2) pixels, and sometimes white (0) pixels.
  - observation: |
      The transformation seems to be related to the number of blue neighbors a blue pixel has.
  - rule_hypothesis: |
      Blue pixels change to red based on their immediate blue neighbors.  The provided code works for all given examples.  Hypothesis: The current hypothesis is sufficient for the given examples.
