Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains primarily two colors: white (0) and red (2), with a small "T" shaped structure of azure (8) and red(2) near the top. The output grid consists almost entirely of red (2), except for two azure (8) pixels that seem to correspond to the azure pixels in the input, but their position is adjusted. The output maintains the 3x3 area where the shape was in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, red, azure]
      - size: large
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [red, azure]
      - size: small
  - object: azure_shape
    type: shape
    properties:
       - initial_position: top_center
       - shape: T like
  - action: extract_subgrid
    description: A subgrid containing the colored objects is extracted.
  - action: translate_azure
    description: positions of azure are relative, and kept intact within the subgrid.
  - action: fill_background
    description: All non-azure pixels in subgrid become red

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Region of Interest:** Locate the smallest rectangular subgrid within the input that encompasses all non-white (non-0) pixels. It will be the area around the "T" shape.
2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new grid representing the region from step 1.
3. **Translate**: Preserve the relative position and color of any azure (8) pixels withing the region
4.  **Fill Background:** Change all white pixels to red.

In Essence - Extract the area with colored pixels, translate a shape defined by '8' pixels, and change all the other pixels in the extracted shape to red.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
