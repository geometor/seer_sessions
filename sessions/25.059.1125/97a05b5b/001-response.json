The background is predominantly white (0) and large areas of red (2) are common. Smaller objects of varying colors (1, 3, 4, 5, 8) are present within or around the red areas. The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids and appear to be cropped sections containing a simplified representation of the input.\u00a0 The key seems to be identifying and isolating these smaller, non-red and non-white objects. The output grids have a lot of red, and white is completely removed.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Remove all white background pixels.\n6. Return just the section with sub-objects and some red.\n\nIn essence, the transformation isolates the non-red, non-white objects, finds a region encompassing them, crops the input to that region, and simplifies the cropped region by removing the white background. The red (2) portions overlapping the cropped regions are preserved.\n"
