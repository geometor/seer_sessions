The input grid contains primarily two colors: white (0) and red (2), with a small \"T\" shaped structure of azure (8) and red(2) near the top. The output grid consists almost entirely of red (2), except for two azure (8) pixels that seem to correspond to the azure pixels in the input, but their position is adjusted. The output maintains the 3x3 area where the shape was in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
