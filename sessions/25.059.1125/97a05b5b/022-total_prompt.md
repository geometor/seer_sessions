Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on the first training example, which involved extracting a subgrid, preserving azure pixels, and filling the rest with red. The testing on subsequent examples reveals that this rule doesn't hold universally. Some examples highlight discrepancies, specifically with the colors being used.

The key strategy for improving the code will be to:

1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** The core assumption about red (2) as the fill color and preserving only azure (8) needs to be revised, possibly to generalize to other fill and preserve colors.
2.  **Conditional Logic:** The transformation might be dependent on certain conditions present in the input grid, which the current program doesn't account for. We need to look for patterns that correlate input characteristics with output transformations.
3. **Object Identification** Consider other colors that may be "special".

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To understand the transformations better, I'll analyze each example pair, focusing on the input and output grids, the code's output, and the differences.

Here's a breakdown of each example, including an assessment of correctness and observations:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** 3x3 grid with azure (8) pixels in a diagonal and the rest white (0).
*   **Expected Output:** Same as input.
*   **Code Output:** Same as input.
*   **Correct:** Yes.
*  **Observation:** All non white colors were in a bounding box, set all other colors to red

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** 7x7 grid with some gray(5) and azure(8) pixels, other is white
*   **Expected Output:** bounding box of all non-white pixels, all non-azure is red
*   **Code Output:** Same as expected.
*   **Correct:** Yes.
*   **Observation:** All non white colors were in a bounding box, set all other colors to red

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** 7x7 grid with gray and blue,
*   **Expected Output:** bounding box of all non-white pixels, all non-gray is blue
*   **Code Output:** bounding box of all non-white pixels, all non-azure is red
*   **Correct:** No
*   **Observation:** All non white colors were in a bounding box, set all other colors to blue, preserved gray

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves finding the smallest bounding box containing all non-white pixels.
  - object_identification: |
      The input grids contain multiple colors. One color within the bounding box is designated as the "preserve" color. Pixels of other colors within the bounding box become a "fill" color.
  - conditional_logic: |
      The choice of "preserve" and "fill" colors appears to vary between examples, suggesting conditional logic based on input characteristics.
  - example_1_2:
      preserve: azure (8)
      fill: red (2)
  - example_3:
      preserve: gray (5)
      fill: blue (1)
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Region of Interest:** Find the smallest rectangular subgrid (bounding box) that contains all non-white pixels in the input grid.
2. **Identify Preserve and Fill Colors**: Determine which color in non-white is the *preserve* color and the *fill* color. Example 1 and 2 use azure and red, example 3 uses gray and blue.
3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new grid representing the identified subgrid.
4.  **Translate and Fill** Copy the preserve color from the input, set all other pixels to the fill color.
5. **Output** Return the subgrid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
