```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Region of Interest:** Locate the section within the larger, input grid that contains *all* of the non-red and non-white colored pixels from the bottom section of the input array. Specifically, look for the yellow (4) and green (3) pixels.
2.  **Define Boundaries:** Find the bounding rectangle that perfectly encompasses *only* the region of interest *and* some additional red (2) pixels around these non-red and non-white pixels.
3. **Crop and extract.** Extract the region of interest from the top left corner of the smallest bounding rectangle.
4.  **Construct the Output:** The extracted and cropped sub-grid is the output grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
