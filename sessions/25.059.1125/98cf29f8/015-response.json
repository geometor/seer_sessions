The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and green (3). The input appears to contain a distinct shape resembling a stylized flower or plant, with a red \"blossom\" and a green \"stem\" or \"base.\" The output seems to be a modified version of this shape.  The most notable change is the vertical position of the green and red regions relative to each other. The green region appears to replace where the red region and four vertical green regions used to be.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
