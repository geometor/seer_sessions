"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate any gray (color 5) objects on the grid.
2.  **Segment Gray Object:** For each gray object:
    *   **Identify Longest Vertical Line:** Find the longest contiguous vertical line of gray pixels within the object.
    *   **Remove Vertical Line:** Remove this vertical line from the grid (set the pixels to black/0).
    *   **Remaining Pixels:** Identify all the remaining gray pixels that were *not* part of the longest vertical line.
3.  **Reposition/Preserve Remaining Pixels:**
    *   If there are no other objects, keep the remaining pixels in their original position relative to each other, after the removal of the line.
    * If there are other objects, reposition to be to the left and vertically aligned (will require testing for correct approach).
