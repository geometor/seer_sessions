The input grid transforms into a larger output grid. The most prominent change is the appearance of repeated rows of colors derived from the first row of the input. The second row of the input appears to be copied to the second row of the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Each color (number) in this row is used to generate two new, complete rows in the output.\n3. **Create Repeating Rows** The rows created in the last step alternate with respect to the position in input row 1, with colors in row 1 being repeated to fill entire rows. For example, in this example there were 4 colors in row 1, they fill 8 rows starting from row 3.\n4.  **Output Grid:** The output grid consists of the copied second row, followed by the generated rows from the colors of first row.\n"
