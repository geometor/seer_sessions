The input grids consistently have a row of non-zero color values at the top, followed by a row of the value `5`, and then several rows of `0`.\n*   **Output Grid:** A 2D array with the same width as the input grid. The top two rows (the non-zero and `5` rows) are identical to the input.  Below those rows, the output grid repeats the colors from the first row, extending them downwards. The height appears to be related to the original height.\n* **Colors:** The integers represent colors. The transformation involves replicating specific colors from the top row.\n* **Repetition Pattern**: The colors in first row are repeated to replace white region.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
