The input grid has dimensions 8x3, and the output grid has dimensions 8x3. The colors in the input grid seem to be replaced and replicated based on a specific pattern. The top two rows of the input appear to define a set of colors that are then replicated in a specific repeated sequence in output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These are the key colors that determine the output. In this case, Red (2), Blue (1), Yellow(4), and Gray (5).\n\n2.  **Replicate Pattern:** Starting from the first row, we assign the repeating sequence of Red (2), Blue (1), and Yellow (4) from the first row to the output grid down the rows. Similarly, starting from the second row, we assign the color Gray (5) down the rows of output grid.\n\n3.  **Output Dimensions:** The output grid expands to maintain the same number of columns as input grid but the number of rows expands to keep a pattern from the first two rows. The pattern created using colors from the first two rows.\n\nIn essence, the transformation takes the colors of the top two rows and replicates it vertically to form the output grid, in sequence.\n"
