Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the observation of grey pixels enclosing white pixels, which then turn red. The provided code implements a flood-fill-like algorithm (`is_enclosed`) to determine if a white pixel, adjacent to a grey pixel, is part of an enclosed region. It appears the initial hypothesis is partially correct (adjacency and enclosure are key), but there may be an issue with how `is_enclosed` is implemented, or additional conditions not yet considered based on the results.  My primary focus will be reviewing the failed cases to understand which aspects of the transformation are not correctly captured. We need to pay close attention to the specific configurations where the transformation fails.

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand the results better, I'll describe what happened on each pair, and add notes about the output grid.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** 6x5 grid with a grey rectangle in the center enclosing white pixels.
*   **Expected Output:** White pixels inside the grey rectangle turn red.
*   **Actual Output:** Matches expected output.
*   **Notes:** Perfect match.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** 7x7 grid. Two separate grey regions, one in upper-left that encloses one white pixel, and a second larger structure that starts in the upper-right, down the right side, and then curves into the center (but does not close).
*   **Expected Output:** The white pixel enclosed on four sides in upper-left corner turns red. All other white pixels, including those inside the curve on the right side of the grid, do *not* change.
*   **Actual Output:** All interior white pixels have turned red.
*   **Notes:** The large region in the lower-right *looks* enclosed, but it is not. The `is_enclosed` function may have a bug, causing it to think all shapes are enclosed.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** 9x9 grid. Many individual grey pixels are arranged in columns, surrounding single white pixels.
*   **Expected Output:** White pixels that are enclosed on *four sides* by grey pixels are red.
*   **Actual Output:** All interior white pixels have turned red.
*   **Notes:** It's clear from this example that simply being "inside" is not sufficient. The white pixels in the expected output must be completely enclosed.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - pixels: values ranging from 0-9, representing colors
      - white_pixels: pixels with value 0
      - grey_pixels: pixels with value 5
      - red_pixels: pixels with value 2

  - name: enclosed_region
    type: area
    properties:
       - bounded_by: grey_pixels
       - contains: white_pixels
       - condition_for_change: white pixels inside become red

actions:
  - name: identify_enclosed_regions
    description: Locate areas of white pixels completely surrounded by grey pixels.
    criteria:
       - A white pixel is part of a closed region, if starting from the pixel, there is no path of connected white pixels that leads to the boundary of the grid.
       - Connected pixels are considered up, down, left and right neighbors - not diagonal.

  - name: transform_pixels
    description: Change the color of white pixels within enclosed regions to red.
    precondition: white pixel is inside a closed region as defined by grey pixels.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Grey Pixels:** Locate all pixels with a value of 5 (grey). These pixels will form the potential boundaries of enclosed regions.

2.  **Identify White Pixels:** Locate all pixels with a value of 0 (white).

3.  **Check for Enclosure:** For each white pixel, determine if it is part of an enclosed region. A region is enclosed if *all paths* of adjacent white pixels, moving only up, down, left, or right (not diagonally), are blocked by grey pixels *before* reaching the edge of the grid.

4. **Adjacency Check:** Confirm the white pixel is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to at least one grey pixel.

5.  **Transformation:** If a white pixel meets *both* criteria (enclosed and adjacent to grey), change its value to 2 (red). Otherwise, leave it unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
