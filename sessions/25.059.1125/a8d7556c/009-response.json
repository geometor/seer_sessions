Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (18x19).\n*   The grids primarily contain two colors: gray (5) and white (0).\n*   The output introduces a new color: red (2).\n*   The red pixels appear in areas that were white in the input.\n*   The red pixels seem to form connected regions, or \"blobs.\"\n*   The introduction of red seems selective, not all white pixels change.\n*   The gray pixels remain entirely untouched.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The pixels that *can* change color are those with the value 0 (white).\n2.  **Selective Transformation**: Some, and possibly all, regions or contiguous sections of white (0) will change color to red (2).\n3. **Preservation of Gray:** Pixels with the value 5 (gray) in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.\n4. **Output:** the resulting grid is the same dimensions of the original, with some sections of 0 value pixels now equal to 2, while all pixels of value 5 remain the same.\n\nIn short, the transformation involves selectively changing contiguous sections of white pixels to red, while leaving gray pixels untouched. The most difficult part to discern from this one example is *which* sections of white are selected to be changed.\n"
