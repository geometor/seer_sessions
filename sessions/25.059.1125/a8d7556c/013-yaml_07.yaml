objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - pixels: values ranging from 0-9, representing colors
      - white_pixels: pixels with value 0
      - grey_pixels: pixels with value 5
      - red_pixels: pixels with value 2

  - name: enclosed_region
    type: area
    properties:
       - bounded_by: grey_pixels
       - contains: white_pixels
       - condition_for_change: white pixels inside become red

actions:
  - name: identify_enclosed_regions
    description: Locate areas of white pixels completely surrounded by grey pixels.
    criteria:
       - A white pixel is part of a closed region, if starting from the pixel, there is no path of connected white pixels that leads to the boundary of the grid.
       - Connected pixels are considered up, down, left and right neighbors - not diagonal.

  - name: transform_pixels
    description: Change the color of white pixels within enclosed regions to red.
    precondition: white pixel is inside a closed region as defined by grey pixels.
