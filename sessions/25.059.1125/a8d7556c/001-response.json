The dominant colors are gray (5) and white (0), with occasional occurrences of red (2). The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some of the white (0) pixels to red (2) pixels, while leaving the gray pixels untouched. The placement of the red pixels doesn't seem random; it appears to be related to the configuration of the white pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It appears connected components that are 2x2, change completely to red. It also seems like areas of 2x1 or 1x2 may also turn red.\n\n4.  **Preservation of Gray:** Gray pixels remain unchanged throughout the transformation.\n\nThe core logic is to identify regions of only white connected pixels of either size 2x2, 2x1, or 1x2 and change them to red.\n"
