The transformation introduces red (2) pixels in specific locations within the gray areas. The overall structure/shape of the gray and white regions seems to be preserved. It looks like the red pixels are replacing some of the gray pixels. The placement rule for red pixels isn't immediately obvious, but it might relate to connected regions or some spatial property.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

A contiguous region is defined as a group of gray pixels connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n2.  **Select Gray Pixels for Replacement:** Within certain identified gray regions, select some gray pixels to be changed. The selection criteria will be some of the interior gray pixels.\n\n3. **Change selected Pixel color:** Change the color of the select gray pixels identified for replacement to red (2).\n\n4.  **Output:** The output grid is the same as the input grid, except for the gray pixels that have been replaced with red pixels. The choice for which gray areas and which pixels within gray areas are selected will take further analysis to identify the selection process.\n"
