Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (15x16) of colored pixels into a smaller grid (6x5) of colored pixels. The output grid seems to be a condensed and rearranged representation of certain color patterns within the input grid. There appear to be distinct objects or regions of color in the input that are somehow summarized or represented in the output. The colors in the output are present in the input, and it is likely that their positioning in the input grid influences their presence and position in the output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 15x16
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8] # Values representing colors
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8]
  - name: azure_region
    type: object
    color: 8
    shape: irregular
    location: top-left
    input_grid_coords: [(1,1), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4)]
  - name: yellow_region
    type: object
    color: 4
    shape: horizontal line
    location: middle
    input_grid_coords:  [(7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10)]
  - name: red_region
      type: object
      color: 2
      shape: vertical line
      location: middle-left
      input_grid_coords: [(8,6), (9,6), (10,6), (11,6)]
  - name: blue_region
    type: object
    color: 1
    shape: vertical line
    location: middle-right
    input_grid_coords: [(8, 11), (9, 11), (10, 11), (11, 11)]
  - name: green_region
    type: object
    color: 3
    shape: horizontal line
    location: bottom
    input_grid_coords: [(12, 7), (12, 8), (12, 9), (12, 10)]

actions:
  - type: condense
    description: The input grid is condensed into a smaller output grid.
  - type: represent
    description: Specific colored regions in the input are represented in the output, potentially based on their shape, location, and color.
  - type: rearrange
    description: the positions do not directly copy, the objects are arranged

relationships:
  - input_grid contains azure_region, yellow_region, red_region, blue_region, green_region
  - output_grid represents colors and relative arrangement of regions from input_grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Regions:** Locate the distinct regions of azure (8), yellow (4), red (2), blue (1), and green (3) within the input grid. Note their colors, shapes, and relative positions.

2.  **Create Output Grid:** Construct a 6x6 output grid.

3. **Populate first row:** Place a yellow (4) object of length four in the top of the output.

4.  **Populate azure region,** Place the azure (8) object into output grid by outlining the azure shape in a clockwise manner starting from the upper leftmost pixel. Ignore connected pixels from the same shape

5.  **Populate other colors**: Place, vertically from top to bottom, a red(2) to the left and a blue(1) to the right of the azure region.

6. **Populate last row:** Place the green (3) at the last row by skipping one position from left and right.

7. **Fill surrounding pixels**: Ensure that the corners are filled with zeros (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
