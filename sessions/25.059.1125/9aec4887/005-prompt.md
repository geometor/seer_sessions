Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms a larger grid into a smaller one by representing specific colored regions.

1. Identify Key Regions: Locate the distinct regions of azure (8), yellow (4), red (2), blue (1), and green (3) within the input grid. Note their colors, shapes, and relative positions.
2. Create Output Grid: Construct a 6x6 output grid.
3. Populate first row: Place a yellow (4) object of length four in the top of the output.
4. Populate azure region: Place the azure (8) object into output grid by outlining the azure shape in a clockwise manner starting from the upper leftmost pixel. Ignore connected pixels from the same shape
5. Populate other colors: Place, vertically from top to bottom, a red(2) to the left and a blue(1) to the right of the azure region.
6. Populate last row: Place the green (3) at the last row by skipping one position from left and right.
7. Fill surrounding pixels: Ensure that the corners are filled with zeros (0).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
